Abstract = {{The identification of low-energy conformers for a given molecule is a
   fundamental problem in computational chemistry and cheminformatics. We
   assess here a conformer search that employs a genetic algorithm for
   sampling the low-energy segment of the conformation space of molecules.
   The algorithm is designed to work with first-principles methods,
   facilitated by the incorporation of local optimization and blacklisting
   conformers to prevent repeated evaluations of very similar solutions.
   The aim of the search is not only to find the global minimum but to
   predict all conformers within an energy window above the global minimum.
   The performance of the search strategy is (i) evaluated for a reference
   data set extracted from a database with amino acid dipeptide conformers
   obtained by an extensive combined force field and first-principles
   search and (ii) compared to the performance of a systematic search and a
   random conformer generator for the example of a drug-like ligand with 43
   atoms, 8 rotatable bonds, and 1 cis/trans bond.}},

Abstract = {{The kinematic redundancy of the human arm enables the elbow position to
   rotate about the axis going through the shoulder and wrist, which
   results in infinite possible arm postures when the arm reaches to a
   target in a 3-D workspace. To infer the control strategy the human motor
   system uses to resolve redundancy in reaching movements, this paper
   compares five redundancy resolution criteria and evaluates their arm
   posture prediction performance using data on healthy human motion. Two
   synthesized criteria are developed to provide better real-time arm
   posture prediction than the five individual criteria. Of these two, the
   criterion synthesized using an exponential method predicts the arm
   posture more accurately than that using a least squares approach, and
   therefore is preferable for inferring the contributions of the
   individual criteria to motor control during reaching movements. As a
   methodology contribution, this paper proposes a framework to compare and
   evaluate redundancy resolution criteria for arm motion control. A
   cluster analysis which associates criterion contributions with regions
   of the workspace provides a guideline for designing a real-time motion
   control system applicable to upper-limb exoskeletons for stroke
   rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a frequency-diverse, metamaterial-based aperture has been
   introduced in the context of microwave and millimeter wave imaging. The
   generic form of the aperture is that of a parallel plate waveguide, in
   which complementary metamaterial elements patterned into the upper plate
   couple energy from the waveguide mode to the scene. To reliably predict
   the imaging performance of such an aperture prior to fabrication and
   experiments, it is necessary to have an accurate forward model that
   predicts radiation from the aperture, a model for scattering from an
   arbitrary target in the scene, and a set of image reconstruction
   approaches that allow scene estimation from an arbitrary set of
   measurements. Here, we introduce a forward model in which the
   metamaterial elements are approximated as polarizable magnetic dipoles,
   excited by the fields propagating within the waveguide. The dipoles used
   in the model can have arbitrarily assigned polarizability
   characteristics. Alternatively, fields measured from actual metamaterial
   samples can be decomposed into a set of effective dipole radiators,
   allowing the performance of actual samples to be quantitatively modeled
   and compared with simulated apertures. To confirm the validity of our
   model, we simulate measurements and scene reconstructions with a virtual
   multiaperture imaging system operating in the K-band spectrum (18-26.5
   GHz) and compare its performance with an experimental system. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Measurements of plaque stiffness may provide important prognostic and
   diagnostic information to help clinicians distinguish vulnerable plaques
   containing soft lipid pools from more stable, stiffer plaques. In this
   preliminary study, we compare in vivo ultrasonic Acoustic Radiation
   Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging derived measures of carotid plaque
   stiffness with composition determined by spatially registered Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (MRI) in five human subjects with stenosis >50\%.
   Ultrasound imaging was implemented on a commercial diagnostic scanner
   with custom pulse sequences to collect spatially registered 2D
   longitudinal B-mode and ARFI images. A standardized, multi-contrast
   weighted MRI sequence was used to obtain 3D Time of Flight (TOF), T1
   weighted (T1W), T2 weighted (T2W), and Proton Density Weighted (PDW)
   transverse image stacks of volumetric data. The MRI data was segmented
   to identify lipid, calcium, and normal loose matrix components using
   commercially available software. 3D MRI segmented plaque models were
   rendered and spatially registered with 2D B-mode images to create fused
   ultrasound and MRI volumetric images for each subject. ARFI imaging
   displacements in regions of interest (ROIs) derived from MRI segmented
   contours of varying composition were compared. Regions of calcium and
   normal loose matrix components identified by MRI presented as
   homogeneously stiff regions of similarly low (typically approximate to 1
   mu m) displacement in ARFI imaging. MRI identified lipid pools > 2
   mm(2), found in three out of five subjects, presented as softer regions
   of increased displacement that were on average 1.8 times greater than
   the displacements in adjacent regions of loose matrix components in
   spatially registered ARFI images. This work provides early evidence
   supporting the use of ARFI imaging to noninvasively identify lipid
   regions in carotid artery plaques in vivo that are believed to increase
   the propensity of a plaque to rupture. Additionally, the results provide
   early training data for future studies and aid in the interpretation and
   possible clinical utility of ARFI imaging for identifying the elusive
   vulnerable plaque.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonic resonances in metallic nanostructures have been shown to
   drastically enhance local electromagnetic fields, and thereby increase
   the efficiency of nonlinear optical phenomena, such as second harmonic
   generation (SHG). While it has been experimentally observed that
   enhanced fields can significantly boost SHG, to date it proved difficult
   to probe electrical and magnetic resonance in one and the same
   nanostructure. This however is necessary to directly compare relative
   contributions of electrical and magnetic components of SHG enhancement.
   In this paper we report an experimental study of a metasurface capable
   of providing electrical and magnetic resonant SHG enhancement for TM
   polarization. Our metasurface could be engineered such that the peak
   frequencies of electrical and magnetic resonances could be adjusted
   independently. We used this feature to distinguish their relative
   contributions. Experimentally it was observed that the magnetic
   resonance provides only 50\% as much enhancement to SHG as compared to
   the electric resonance. In addition aligning both resonances in
   frequency results in conversion efficiency of 1.32 x 10(-10). (C) 2015

Title = {{Inflammatory Cytokines and Matrix Metalloproteinases in the Synovial

Abstract = {{Background: Posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) can occur after
   intra-articular fracture despite anatomic fracture reduction. It has
   been hypothesized that an early inflammatory response after
   intra-articular injury could lead to irreversible cartilage damage that
   progresses to PTOA. Therefore, in addition to meticulous fracture
   reduction, it would be ideal to prevent this initial inflammatory
   response but little is known about the composition of the synovial
   environment after intra-articular fracture. The purpose of this work was
   to characterize the inflammatory cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase
   (MMP) composition in the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with acute
   intra-articular ankle fractures.
   Methods: Twenty-one patients with an intra-articular ankle fracture were
   included in this study. All patients had a contralateral ankle joint
   that was pain free, had no radiographic evidence of arthritis, and no
   history of trauma. The uninjured ankle served as a matched control. SF
   was obtained from bilateral ankles at the time of surgery which occurred
   at a mean of 17 days post-fracture (range 8-40). The SF was analyzed for
   granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
   interferon-gamma (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin
   (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9,
   MMP-10, CTXII, sGAG, and bilirubin/biliverdin (markers of hemearthrosis)
   using either multiplex assay or ELISA using commercially available kits.
   Mean concentrations of each factor were compared between SF from
   fractured and control ankles, and correlation analysis was done to
   determine potential relationships between levels of cytokines and time
   from fracture and age at fracture.
   Results: Twelve of 18 measured factors including GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-1,
   IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10, and
   bilirubin/biliverdin were found to be significantly higher in the
   fractured ankles. Mean concentrations of ECM degradation markers (sGAG
   and CTXII) were not found to be significatnly different between groups.
   Conclusion: These data indicate that after intra-articular ankle
   fracture the SF exhibits a largely pro-inflammatory and extra-cellular
   matrix degrading environment similar to that described in idiopathic
   osteoarthritis. IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-10 were
   significantly elevated and may play a role in the development of PTOA.
   Clinical Relevance: In addition to anatomic fracture reduction, these
   data lend credence to reducing acute intra-articular inflammation
   through the development of antagonists to these pro-inflammatory and
   degrading mediators. Likewise, intra-articular lavage might reduce this
   inflammatory burden.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) can
   successfully resect large lesions en bloc by using a submucosal
   injection solution, but the cost of currently available submucosal
   injection solutions is not satisfactory. The authors' aim was to
   evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a thermally sensitive
   elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) used as submucosal injection solution in
   ESD.
   Methods: We conducted an ex vivo study to determine the optimal
   concentration of ELPs in rabbits, an in vivo study to evaluate the
   effectiveness of mucosal elevation in rats, and a large animal study to
   confirm the feasibility of preclinical application by using conventional
   clinical procedure in pigs.
   Results: ELP (500 mu M) was proved to be the optimal injectable
   submucosal injection solution and elevated mucosa more efficiently than
   any control. The same concentration of ELP exhibited an equivalent
   effectiveness of mucosal elevation, the retention of the elevation, and
   minimal bleeding with sodium hyaluronate. The ESD procedure time with
   500 mu M ELP in a preclinical study with pigs was significantly shorter
   than with any other concentration of ELP and normal saline solution.
   Conclusions: Use of ELP as submucosal injection solution was feasible,
   with higher and longer-lasting elevation and fewer adverse events.}},

Abstract = {{Breast fibroepithelial tumors comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of
   pathological entities, from benign fibroadenomas to malignant phyllodes
   tumors(1). Although MED12 mutations have been frequently found in
   fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors(2-7), the landscapes of genetic
   alterations across the fibroepithelial tumor spectrum remain unclear.
   Here, by performing exome sequencing of 22 phyllodes tumors followed by
   targeted sequencing of 100 breast fibroepithelial tumors, we observed
   three distinct somatic mutation patterns. First, we frequently observed
   MED12 and RARA mutations in both fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors,
   emphasizing the importance of these mutations in fibroepithelial
   tumorigenesis. Second, phyllodes tumors exhibited mutations in FLNA,
   SETD2 and KMT2D, suggesting a role in driving phyllodes tumor
   development. Third, borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors harbored
   additional mutations in cancer-associated genes. RARA mutations
   exhibited clustering in the portion of the gene encoding the
   ligand-binding domain, functionally suppressed RARA-mediated
   transcriptional activation and enhanced RARA interactions with
   transcriptional co-repressors. This study provides insights into the
   molecular pathogenesis of breast fibroepithelial tumors, with potential
   clinical implications.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The mechanisms linking obesity and osteoarthritis (OA) are not
   fully understood and have been generally attributed to increased weight,
   rather than metabolic or inflammatory factors. Here, we examined the
   influence of fatty acids, adipokines, and body weight on OA following
   joint injury in an obese mouse model.
   Methods Mice were fed high-fat diets rich in various fatty acids (FA)
   including saturated FAs (SFAs), omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), and
   omega-3 PUFAs. OA was induced by destabilising the medial meniscus.
   Wound healing was evaluated using an ear punch. OA, synovitis and wound
   healing were determined histologically, while bone changes were measured
   using microCT. Activity levels and serum cytokines were measured at
   various time-points. Multivariate models were performed to elucidate the
   associations of dietary, metabolic and mechanical factors with OA and
   wound healing.
   Results Using weight-matched mice and multivariate models, we found that
   OA was significantly associated with dietary fatty acid content and
   serum adipokine levels, but not with body weight. Furthermore,
   spontaneous activity of the mice was independent of OA development.
   Small amounts of omega-3 PUFAs (8\% by kcal) in a high-fat diet were
   sufficient to mitigate injuryinduced OA, decreasing leptin and resistin
   levels. omega-3 PUFAs significantly enhanced wound repair, SFAs or
   omega-6 PUFAs independently increased OA severity, heterotopic
   ossification and scar tissue formation.
   Conclusions Our results indicate that with obesity, dietary FA content
   regulates wound healing and OA severity following joint injury,
   independent of body weight, supporting the need for further studies of
   dietary FA supplements as a potential therapeutic approach for OA.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We examined the impact of priming on operator trust and
   system performance when supervising a decentralized network of
   heterogeneous unmanned vehicles (UVs).
   Background: Advances in autonomy have enabled a future vision of
   single-operator control of multiple heterogeneous UVs. Real-time
   scheduling for multiple UVs in uncertain environments requires the
   computational ability of optimization algorithms combined with the
   judgment and adaptability of human supervisors. Because of system and
   environmental uncertainty, appropriate operator trust will be
   instrumental to maintain high system performance and prevent cognitive
   overload.
   Method: Three groups of operators experienced different levels of trust
   priming prior to conducting simulated missions in an existing,
   multiple-UV simulation environment.
   Results: Participants who play computer and video games frequently were
   found to have a higher propensity to overtrust automation. By priming
   gamers to lower their initial trust to a more appropriate level, system
   performance was improved by 10\% as compared to gamers who were primed
   to have higher trust in the automation.
   Conclusion: Priming was successful at adjusting the operator's initial
   and dynamic trust in the automated scheduling algorithm, which had a
   substantial impact on system performance.
   Application: These results have important implications for personnel
   selection and training for futuristic multi-UV systems under human
   supervision. Although gamers may bring valuable skills, they may also be
   potentially prone to automation bias. Priming during training and
   regular priming throughout missions may be one potential method for
   overcoming this propensity to overtrust automation.}},

Abstract = {{3-D integration using through-silicon vias offers many benefits, such as
   high bandwidth, low power, and small footprint. However, test complexity
   and test cost are major concerns for 3-D ICs. Recent work on the
   optimization of 3-D test architectures to reduce test cost suffer from
   the drawback that they ignore potential uncertainties in input
   parameters; they consider only a single point in the input-parameter
   space. In realistic scenarios, the assumed values for parameters such as
   test power and pattern count of logic cores, which are used for
   optimizing the test architecture for a die, may differ from the actual
   values that are known only after the design stage. In a 3-D setting, a
   die can be used in multiple stacks with different properties. As a
   result, the originally designed test architecture is no longer optimal,
   which leads to an undesirable increase in the test cost. We propose an
   optimization approach that takes uncertainties in input parameters into
   account and provides a solution that is efficient in the presence of
   input-parameter variations. We formulate a mathematical model for the
   robust test-architecture optimization problem, and propose an efficient
   heuristic to solve the problem even for large designs in reasonable
   time. The proposed optimization framework is evaluated using the ITC'02
   SoC benchmarks and we show that robust solutions are superior to
   single-point solutions in terms of average test time when there are
   uncertainties in the values of input parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Proteins and synthetic polymers that undergo aqueous phase transitions
   mediate self-assembly in nature and in man-made material systems. Yet
   little is known about how the phase behaviour of a protein is encoded in
   its amino acid sequence. Here, by synthesizing intrinsically disordered,
   repeat proteins to test motifs that we hypothesized would encode phase
   behaviour, we show that the proteins can be designed to exhibit tunable
   lower or upper critical solution temperature (LCST and UCST,
   respectively) transitions in physiological solutions. We also show that
   mutation of key residues at the repeat level abolishes phase behaviour
   or encodes an orthogonal transition. Furthermore, we provide heuristics
   to identify, at the proteome level, proteins that might exhibit phase
   behaviour and to design novel protein polymers consisting of
   biologically active peptide repeats that exhibit LCST or UCST
   transitions. These findings set the foundation for the prediction and
   encoding of phase behaviour at the sequence level.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active plasmonic nanomaterials
   have become a promising agent for molecular imaging and multiplex
   detection. Among the wide variety of plasmonics-active nanoparticles,
   gold nanostars offer unique plasmon properties that efficiently induce
   strong SERS signals. Furthermore, nanostars, with their small core size
   and multiple long thin branches, exhibit high absorption cross sections
   that are tunable in the near-infrared region of the tissue optical
   window, rendering them efficient for in vivo spectroscopic detection.
   This study investigated the use of SERS-encoded gold nanostars for in
   vivo detection. Ex vivo measurements were performed using human skin
   grafts to investigate the detection of SERS-encoded nanostars through
   tissue. We also integrated gold nanostars into a biocompatible scaffold
   to aid in performing in vivo spectroscopic analyses. In this study, for
   the first time, we demonstrate in vivo SERS detection of gold nanostars
   using small animal (rat) as well as large animal (pig) models. The
   results of this study establish the usefulness and potential of
   SERS-encoded gold nanostars for future use in long-term in vivo analyte
   sensing.}},

Abstract = {{A novel chemical ionization (CI) source has been developed based on a

   positive and negative modes were investigated. Spectra were collected
   for a standard mass spectrometer calibration compound,
   perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA), as well as trace explosives including
   trinitrotoluene (TNT), Research Department explosive (RDX), and
   pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The electrical characteristics,
   lifetime at operating pressure, and power requirements of the CNT-based
   electron source are reported. The CNT field emission electron sources
   demonstrated an average lifetime of 320 h when operated in constant
   emission mode under elevated CI pressures. The ability of the CNT field
   emission source to cycle on and off can provide enhanced lifetime and
   reduced power consumption without sacrificing performance and detection

Abstract = {{In the United States, aquatic mercury contamination originates from
   point and non-point sources to watersheds. Here, we studied the
   contribution of mercury in urban runoff derived from historically
   contaminated soils and the subsequent production of methylmercury in a
   stream-wetland complex (Durham, North Carolina), the receiving water of
   this runoff. Our results demonstrated that the mercury originated from
   the leachate of grass-covered athletic fields. A fraction of mercury in
   this soil existed as phenylmercury, suggesting that mercurial
   anti-fungal compounds were historically applied to this soil. Further
   downstream in the anaerobic sediments of the stream-wetland complex, a
   fraction (up to 9\%) of mercury was converted to methylmercury, the
   bioaccumulative form of the metal. Importantly, the concentrations of
   total mercury and methylmercury were reduced to background levels within
   the stream-wetland complex. Overall, this work provides an example of a
   legacy source of mercury that should be considered in urban watershed
   models and watershed management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for the inverse identification of
   linearly viscoelastic material parameters in the context of steady-state
   dynamics using interior data. The inverse problem of viscoelasticity
   imaging is solved by minimizing a modified error in constitutive
   equation (MECE) functional, subject to the conservation of linear
   momentum. The treatment is applicable to configurations where boundary
   conditions may be partially or completely underspecified. The MECE
   functional measures the discrepancy in the constitutive equations that
   connect kinematically admissible strains and dynamically admissible
   stresses, and also incorporates the measurement data in a quadratic
   penalty term. Regularization of the problem is achieved through a
   penalty parameter in combination with the discrepancy principle due to
   Morozov. Numerical results demonstrate the robust performance of the
   method in situations where the available measurement data is incomplete
   and corrupted by noise of varying levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Removing Camera Shake via Weighted Fourier Burst Accumulation}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Numerous recent approaches attempt to remove image blur due to camera
   shake, either with one or multiple input images, by explicitly solving
   an inverse and inherently ill-posed deconvolution problem. If the
   photographer takes a burst of images, a modality available in virtually
   all modern digital cameras, we show that it is possible to combine them
   to get a clean sharp version. This is done without explicitly solving
   any blur estimation and subsequent inverse problem. The proposed
   algorithm is strikingly simple: it performs a weighted average in the
   Fourier domain, with weights depending on the Fourier spectrum
   magnitude. The method can be seen as a generalization of the align and
   average procedure, with a weighted average, motivated by hand-shake
   physiology and theoretically supported, taking place in the Fourier
   domain. The method's rationale is that camera shake has a random nature,
   and therefore, each image in the burst is generally blurred differently.
   Experiments with real camera data, and extensive comparisons, show that
   the proposed Fourier burst accumulation algorithm achieves
   state-of-the-art results an order of magnitude faster, with simplicity
   for on-board implementation on camera phones. Finally, we also present
   experiments in real high dynamic range (HDR) scenes, showing how the
   method can be straightforwardly extended to HDR photography.}},

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{13-28}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dimensionality reduction in multivariate time series analysis has broad
   applications, ranging from financial data analysis to biomedical
   research. However, high levels of ambient noise and various
   interferences result in nonstationary signals, which may lead to
   inefficient performance of conventional methods. In this paper, we
   propose a nonlinear dimensionality reduction framework using diffusion
   maps on a learned statistical manifold, which gives rise to the
   construction of a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional
   nonstationary time series. We show that diffusion maps, with affinity
   kernels based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the local
   statistics of samples, allow for efficient approximation of pairwise
   geodesic distances. To construct the statistical manifold, we estimate
   time-evolving parametric distributions by designing a family of Bayesian
   generative models. The proposed framework can be applied to problems in
   which the time-evolving distributions (of temporally localized data),
   rather than the samples themselves, are driven by a low-dimensional
   underlying process. We provide efficient parameter estimation and
   dimensionality reduction methodologies, and apply them to two
   applications: music analysis and epileptic-seizure prediction. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The effective discharge constitutes a key concept in river science and
   engineering. Notwithstanding many years of studies, a full understanding
   of the effective discharge determinants is still challenged by the
   variety of values identified for different river catchments. The present
   paper relates the observed diversity of effective discharge to the
   underlying heterogeneity of flow regimes. An analytic framework is
   proposed, which links the effective ratio (i.e., the ratio between
   effective discharge and mean streamflow) to the empirical exponent of
   the sediment rating curve and to the streamflow variability, resulting
   from climatic and landscape drivers. The analytic formulation predicts
   patterns of effective ratio versus streamflow variability observed in a
   set of catchments of the continental United States and helps in
   disentangling the major climatic and landscape drivers of sediment
   transport in rivers. The findings highlight larger effective ratios of
   erratic hydrologic regimes (characterized by high flow variability)
   compared to those exhibited by persistent regimes, which are
   attributable to intrinsically different streamflow dynamics. The
   framework provides support for the estimate of effective discharge in
   rivers belonging to diverse climatic areas.}},

Abstract = {{Hundreds of organic chemicals are used during natural gas extraction via
   high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF). However, it is unclear whether
   these chemicals, injected into deep shale horizons, reach shallow
   groundwater aquifers and affect local water quality, either from those
   deep HVHF injection sites or from the surface or shallow subsurface.
   Here, we report detectable levels of organic compounds in shallow
   groundwater samples from private residential wells overlying the
   Marcellus Shale in northeastern Pennsylvania. Analyses of purgeable and
   extractable organic compounds from 64 groundwater samples revealed trace
   levels of volatile organic compounds, well below the Environmental
   Protection Agency's maximum contaminant levels, and low levels of both
   gasoline range (0-8 ppb) and diesel range organic compounds (DRO; 0-157
   ppb). A compound-specific analysis revealed the presence of
   bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, which is a disclosed HVHF additive, that
   was notably absent in a representative geogenic water sample and field
   blanks. Pairing these analyses with (i) inorganic chemical
   fingerprinting of deep saline groundwater, (ii) characteristic noble gas
   isotopes, and (iii) spatial relationships between active shale gas
   extraction wells and wells with disclosed environmental health and
   safety violations, we differentiate between a chemical signature
   associated with naturally occurring saline groundwater and one
   associated with alternative anthropogenic routes from the surface (e.g.,
   accidental spills or leaks). The data support a transport mechanism of
   DRO to groundwater via accidental release of fracturing fluid chemicals
   derived from the surface rather than subsurface flow of these fluids
   from the underlying shale formation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the passive control of chatter instability in
   turning processes using a vibro-impact nonlinear energy sink (NES). The
   workpiece is assumed to be rigid and the tool is flexible. A dynamical
   model including a nonlinear cutting law is presented and the stability
   lobes diagram is obtained. The behavior of the system with the
   vibro-irnpact NES is investigated using an asymptotic analysis. A
   control mechanism by successive beating is revealed, similarly to the
   strongly modulated response in the case of NES with cubic stiffness. It
   is shown that such a response regime may be beneficial for chaffer
   mitigation. An original experimental procedure is proposed to verify the
   sizing of the vibro-impact NES. An experimental setup is developed with
   a vibro-impact NES embedded on the lathe tool and the results are
   analyzed and validated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Layered manganese oxide, i.e., birnessite was prepared via the reaction
   of potassium permanganate with ammonium oxalate. The water content in
   the bimessite was adjusted by drying/calcining the samples at various
   temperatures (30 degrees C, 100 degrees C, 200 degrees C, 300 degrees C,
   and 500 degrees C). Thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy showed three
   types of water released from bimessite, which can be ascribed to
   physically adsorbed H2O, interlayer H2O and hydroxyl, respectively. The
   activity of bimessite for formaldehyde oxidation was positively
   associated with its water content, i.e., the higher the water content,
   the better activity it has. In-situ DRIFTS and step scanning XRD
   analysis indicate that adsorbed formaldehyde, which is promoted by
   bonded water via hydrogen bonding, is transformed into formate and
   carbonate with the consumption of hydroxyl and bonded water. Both bonded
   water and water in air can compensate the consumed hydroxyl groups to
   sustain the mineralization of formaldehyde at room temperature. In
   addition, water in air stimulates the desorption of carbonate via water
   competitive adsorption, and accordingly the bimessite recovers its
   activity. This investigation elucidated the role of water in oxidizing
   formaldehyde by layered manganese oxides at room temperature, which may
   be helpful for the development of more efficient materials.}},

Abstract = {{CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 cuts DNA at variable target sites
   designated by a Cas9-bound RNA molecule. Cas9's ability to be directed
   by single `guide RNA' molecules to target nearly any sequence has been
   recently exploited for a number of emerging biological andmedical
   applications. Therefore, understanding the nature of Cas9's off-target
   activity is of paramount importance for its practical use. Using atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), we directly resolve individual Cas9 and
   nuclease-inactive dCas9 proteins as they bind along engineered DNA
   substrates. High-resolution imaging allows us to determine their
   relative propensities to bind with different guide RNA variants to
   targeted or off-target sequences. Mapping the structural properties of
   Cas9 and dCas9 to their respective binding sites reveals a progressive
   conformational transformation at DNA sites with increasing sequence
   similarity to its target. With kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations,
   these results provide evidence of a `conformational gating' mechanism
   driven by the interactions between the guide RNA and the 14th-17th
   nucleotide region of the targeted DNA, the stabilities of which we find
   correlate significantly with reported off-target cleavage rates. KMC
   simulations also reveal potential methodologies to engineer guide RNA
   sequences with improved specificity by considering the invasion of guide
   RNAs into targeted DNA duplex.}},

Abstract = {{Proton exchange membranes (PEM) are critical components of low
   temperature fuel cells. Most PEMs are made of perfluorinated sulfonic
   acid polymers such as Nafion (R). However, Nafion has a high methanol
   permeability which is limiting its applicability in direct methanol fuel
   cells (DMFCs). Here, we report on novel sulfonated
   pillar{[}5]arene/Nafion composite membranes with improved properties for
   application in DMFCs. The properties of the novel composite membranes
   were investigated under a range of synthesis and operating conditions.
   Under most conditions, the novel composite membranes exhibited
   properties far superior than Nafion. For example, the proton
   conductivity of the sulfonated pillar{[}5]arene's (10 wt.\%)/Nafion
   composite membrane was 0.145 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C, while
   methanol permeability was 2.43 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s. Proton selectivity was
   increased up to two-fold compared to Nafion-recast membrane. The likely
   mechanisms for improvements were discussed. Overall, these results
   indicate that these novel composite membranes are promising for
   application in DMFCs. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Abstract = {{Cardiac pacemaking is governed by specialized cardiomyocytes located in
   the sinoatrial node (SAN). SAN cells (SANCs) integrate voltage-gated
   currents from channels on the membrane surface (membrane clock) with
   rhythmic Ca2+ release from internal Ca2+ stores (Ca2+ clock) to adjust
   heart rate to meet hemodynamic demand. Here, we report that stromal
   interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 channels, key components of
   store-operated Ca2+ entry, are selectively expressed in SANCs.
   Cardiac-specific deletion of STIM1 in mice resulted in depletion of
   sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores of SANCs and led to SAN
   dysfunction, as was evident by a reduction in heart rate, sinus arrest,
   and an exaggerated autonomic response to cholinergic signaling.
   Moreover, STIM1 influenced SAN function by regulating ionic fluxes in
   SANCs, including activation of a store-operated Ca2+ current, a
   reduction in L-type Ca2+ current, and enhancing the activities of
   Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In conclusion, these studies reveal that STIM1 is a
   multifunctional regulator of Ca2+ dynamics in SANCs that links SR Ca2+
   store content with electrical events occurring in the plasma membrane,
   thereby contributing to automaticity of the SAN.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBV) can serve as vascular grafts and
   may also play an important role in the development of organs-on-a-chip.
   Most TEBV construction involves scaffolding with biomaterials such as
   collagen gel or electrospun fibrous mesh. Hypothesizing that a
   scaffold-free TEBV may be advantageous, we constructed a tubular
   structure (1 mm i.d.) from aligned human mesenchymal cell sheets (hMSC)
   as the wall and human endothelial progenitor cell (hEPC) coating as the
   lumen. The burst pressure of the scaffold-free TEBV was above 200 mmHg
   after three weeks of sequential culture in a rotating wall bioreactor
   and perfusion at 6.8 dynes/cm(2). The interwoven organization of the
   cell layers and extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) formation of the
   hMSC-based TEBV resembled that of native blood vessels. The TEBV
   exhibited flow-mediated vasodilation, vasoconstriction after exposure to
   1 mu M phenylephrine and released nitric oxide in a manner similar to
   that of porcine femoral vein. HL-60 cells attached to the TEBV lumen
   after TNF-alpha activation to suggest a functional endothelium. This
   study demonstrates the potential of a hEPC endothelialized hMSC-based
   TEBV for drug screening.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolution of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) is a key step of
   controlling their environmental fate, bioavailability, and toxicity.
   Rates of dissolution often depend upon factors such as interactions of
   NPs with natural organic matter (NOM). We examined the effects of 16
   different NOM isolates on the dissolution kinetics of ZnO NPs in
   buffered potassium chloride solution using anodic stripping voltammetry
   to directly measure dissolved zinc concentrations. The observed
   dissolution rate constants (k(obs)) and dissolved zinc concentrations at
   equilibrium increased linearly with NOM concentration (from 0 to 40 mg C
   L-1) for Suwannee River humic and fulvic acids and Pony Lake fulvic
   acid. When dissolution rates were compared for the 16 NOM isolates,
   k(obs) was positively correlated with certain properties of NOM,
   including specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), aromatic and carbonyl
   carbon contents, and molecular weight. Dissolution rate constants were
   negatively correlated to hydrogen/carbon ratio and aliphatic carbon
   content. The observed correlations indicate that aromatic carbon content
   is a key factor in determining the rate of NOM-promoted dissolution of
   ZnO NPs. The findings of this study facilitate a better understanding of
   the fate of ZnO NPs in organic-rich aquatic environments and highlight
   SUVA as a facile and useful indicator of NOM interactions with
   metal-based nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor for glaucoma and the
   inner wall of Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelia participates in the
   regulation of aqueous humor outflow resistance. This study aimed to
   identify differentially expressed genes in primary cultures of SC cells
   from glaucoma patients.
   METHODS. This study examined SC samples from three glaucoma cases and
   four controls. Schlemm's canal cells were isolated from eight different
   postmortem human eyes. Total RNA was extracted, labeled, and hybridized
   to Illumina HumanWG-6 BeadChips containing probes for approximately
   47,000 human transcripts. After extracting the data using Illumina
   GenomeStudio software, the data were normalized and analyzed using the R
   package limma in Bioconductor. Using Protein ANalysis THrough
   Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) software, gene ontology analysis of
   highly expressed genes was executed in controls and glaucoma groups
   separately. Pathway analysis was performed with differentially expressed
   genes using WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit). Selected
   genes were validated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).
   RESULTS. Gene ontology analysis indicated similar functional categories
   in cases and controls. Differential analysis identified a total of 113
   genes with at least 2-fold expression changes in cases. Pathway analysis
   indicated significant enrichment of genes in cell adhesion, heparin
   binding, glycosaminoglycan binding, filopodium, and extracellular matrix
   remodeling. Eighteen selected genes with differential expression were
   successfully validated using ddPCR.
   CONCLUSIONS. This study represents the first genome-wide expression
   study of human primary SC cells from glaucoma patients and provides a
   potential list of targets regulating SC cell stiffness and pore
   formation, eventually the outflow resistance in glaucoma individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation cover in dry regions is a key variable in determining
   desertification. Soils exposed to rainfall by desertification can form
   physical crusts that reduce infiltration, exacerbating water stress on
   the remaining vegetation. Paradoxically, field studies show that crust
   removal is associated with plant mortality in desert systems, while
   artificial biological crusts can improve plant regeneration. Here it is
   shown how physical crusts can act as either drivers of or buffers
   against desertification depending on their environmental context. The
   behavior of crusts is first explored using a simplified theory for water
   movement on a uniform, partly vegetated slope subject to stationary
   hydrologic conditions. Numerical model runs supplemented with field data
   from a semiarid Long-Term Ecological Research site are then applied to
   represent more realistic environmental conditions. When vegetation cover
   is significant, crusts can drive desertification, but this process is
   potentially self-limiting. For low vegetation cover, crusts mitigate
   against desertification by providing water subsidy to plant communities
   through a runoff-runon mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Although the concepts of age, survival, and transit time have been
   widely used in many fields, including population dynamics, chemical
   engineering, and hydrology, a comprehensive mathematical framework is
   still missing. Here we discuss several relationships among these
   quantities by starting from the evolution equation for the joint
   distribution of age and survival, from which the equations for age and
   survival time readily follow. It also becomes apparent how the
   statistical dependence between age and survival is directly related to
   either the age dependence of the loss function or the survival-time
   dependence of the input function. The solution of the joint distribution
   equation also allows us to obtain the relationships between the age at
   exit (or death) and the survival time at input (or birth), as well as to
   stress the symmetries of the various distributions under time reversal.
   The transit time is then obtained as a sum of the age and survival time,
   and its properties are discussed along with the general relationships
   between their mean values. The special case of steady state case is
   analyzed in detail. Some examples, inspired by hydrologic applications,
   are presented to illustrate the theory with the specific results.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{8476-8493}},

Abstract = {{The local role that land-atmosphere interactions play in the rainfall
   process has been often explored by investigating the initiation of moist
   convection as the top of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) crosses
   the lifting condensation level (LCL). However, this LCL crossing alone
   is not a sufficient indicator of the probability and intensity of
   subsequent convective precipitation, which is instead better
   characterized by the added consideration of the so-called convective
   available potential energy (CAPE). In this study, both the LCL crossing
   and CAPE are jointly considered as the primary indicators of the
   occurrence and intensity of moist convection in order to analyze the
   land-atmosphere interactions through a simple soil-plant system and a
   zero-dimensional mixed-layer model. The approach is explored using the
   free atmospheric conditions observed at the Central Facility in the
   Southern Great Plains, where the ABL analysis shows both dry and wet
   soil can be conducive to early moist convection depending on atmospheric
   conditions but CAPE always tends to be larger under wetter soil
   conditions. The combination of the two indicators, LCL crossing and
   CAPE, further allows us to classify free atmosphere and soil moisture
   regimes into positive and negative feedback regimes for moist
   convection.}},

   probability function, the necessary conditions for optimality can be
   derived using calculus of variations, and solved numerically using a
   variational iteration method (VIM). The simulation results show that
   sensor state and control trajectories obtained by this approach bring
   about a significant increase in detection probability compared to
   existing strategies, and require a computation that is significantly

Title = {{Impact of Amazonian evapotranspiration on moisture transport and

Abstract = {{The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to investigate
   the impact of Amazonian evapotranspiration (ET) on moisture transport
   and convection along the eastern flanks of the Andes (EADS). To isolate
   the role of surface ET, quasi-idealized simulations down to 1.2 km grid
   spacing were conducted, where over the Amazon lowlands (AMZL) and at
   every time step the surface sensible-heat effects are identical to the
   realistic reference runs while surface latent heat fluxes are prevented
   from entering the atmosphere. The results show that, without surface ET,
   daily precipitation within the AMZL decreases by as much as approximate
   to 75\%, but nearly doubles over the surrounding mountainous regions.
   This dramatic influence is attributed to a dipole structure of
   convergence-divergence anomalies over the AMZL, primarily due to the
   considerable cooling of the troposphere associated with suppressed
   convection. Further examination of moist static energy evolution
   indicates that the net decrease in convective available potential energy
   over the AMZL is due to the removal of surface ET that is only partially
   compensated by related regional circulation changes. Because of the
   concave shape of the Andean mountain range, enhanced low-level
   divergence promotes air mass accumulation to the east of the central
   EADS. This perturbation becomes sufficiently strong around nightfall and
   produces significant eastward low-level pressure gradient force,
   rendering stronger winds away from the Andes. Moisture convergence and
   convection over the EADS vary accordingly, strengthened in the day but
   attenuated at night. Nocturnal convective motion is, however, more
   widespread. Analytical solutions of simplified diagnostic equations of
   convective fraction suggest that reduction of lower troposphere
   evaporation is the driving mechanism. Additional exploratory experiments
   with varied surface ET magnitude demonstrate that the connection between
   the AMZL ET and EADS precipitation is robust.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this review, we summarize from a materials science perspective the
   current state of the field of polymer conjugates of peptide and protein
   drugs, with a focus on polymers that have been developed as alternatives
   to the current gold standard, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). PEGylation,
   or the covalent conjugation of PEG to biological therapeutics to improve
   their therapeutic efficacy by increasing their circulation half-lives
   and stability, has been the gold standard in the pharmaceutical industry
   for several decades. After years of research and development, the
   limitations of PEG, specifically its non-degradability and
   immunogenicity have become increasingly apparent. While PEG is still
   currently the best polymer available with the longest clinical track
   record, extensive research is underway to develop alternative materials
   in an effort to address these limitations of PEG. Many of these
   alternative materials have shown promise, though most of them are still
   in an early stage of development and their in vivo distribution,
   mechanism of degradation, route of elimination and immunogenicity have
   not been investigated to a similar extent as for PEG. Thus, further
   in-depth in vivo testing is essential to validate whether any of the
   alternative materials discussed in this review qualify as a replacement
   for PEG.}},

Abstract = {{In order to propagate a solid tumor, cancer cells must adapt to and
   survive under various tumor microenvironment (TME) stresses, such as
   hypoxia or lactic acidosis. To systematically identify genes that
   modulate cancer cell survival under stresses, we performed genome-wide
   shRNA screens under hypoxia or lactic acidosis. We discovered that
   genetic depletion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA or ACC1) or ATP
   citrate lyase (ACLY) protected cancer cells from hypoxia-induced
   apoptosis. Additionally, the loss of ACLY or ACC1 reduced levels and
   activities of the oncogenic transcription factor ETV4. Silencing ETV4
   also protected cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and led to
   remarkably similar transcriptional responses as with silenced ACLY or
   ACC1, including an anti-apoptotic program. Metabolomic analysis found
   that while alpha-ketoglutarate levels decrease under hypoxia in control
   cells, alpha-ketoglutarate is paradoxically increased under hypoxia when
   ACC1 or ACLY are depleted. Supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate
   rescued the hypoxia-induced apoptosis and recapitulated the decreased
   expression and activity of ETV4, likely via an epigenetic mechanism.
   Therefore, ACC1 and ACLY regulate the levels of ETV4 under hypoxia via
   increased alpha-ketoglutarate. These results reveal that the
   ACC1/ACLY-alpha-ketoglutarate-ETV4 axis is a novel means by which
   metabolic states regulate transcriptional output for life vs. death
   decisions under hypoxia. Since many lipogenic inhibitors are under
   investigation as cancer therapeutics, our findings suggest that the use
   of these inhibitors will need to be carefully considered with respect to
   oncogenic drivers, tumor hypoxia, progression and dormancy. More
   broadly, our screen provides a framework for studying additional tumor
   cell stress-adaption mechanisms in the future.}},

   capacitance as a ubiquitous and constant parameter. However,
   experimental measurements show that the membrane capacitance declines
   with increasing frequency, i.e., exhibits dispersion. We quantified the
   effects of frequency-dependent membrane capacitance, c(f), on the
   excitability of cells and nerve fibers across the frequency range from
   dc to hundreds of kilohertz. Approach. We implemented a model of c(f)
   using linear circuit elements, and incorporated it into several models
   of neurons with different channel kinetics: the Hodgkin-Huxley model of
   an unmyelinated axon, the McIntyre-Richardson-Grill (MRG) of a mammalian
   myelinated axon, and a model of a cortical neuron from prefrontal cortex
   (PFC). We calculated thresholds for excitation and kHz frequency
   conduction block, the conduction velocity, recovery cycle,
   strength-distance relationship and firing rate. Main results. The impact
   of c(f) on activation thresholds depended on the stimulation waveform
   and channel kinetics. We observed no effect using rectangular pulse
   stimulation, and a reduction for frequencies of 10 kHz and above using
   sinusoidal signals only for the MRG model. c(f) had minimal impact on
   the recovery cycle and the strength-distance relationship, whereas the
   conduction velocity increased by up to 7.9\% and 1.7\% for myelinated
   and unmyelinated fibers, respectively. Block thresholds declined
   moderately when incorporating c(f), the effect was greater at higher
   frequencies, and the maximum reduction was 11.5\%. Finally, c(f)
   marginally altered the firing pattern of a model of a PFC cell, reducing
   the median interspike interval by less than 2\%. Significance. This is
   the first comprehensive analysis of the effects of dispersive
   capacitance on neural excitability, and as the interest on stimulation
   with kHz signals gains more attention, it defines the regions over which
   frequency-dependent membrane capacitance, c(f), should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an advanced real-time high-speed echocardiographic system
   with live display while scanning. Images are acquired at rates up to
   1000 per second for adult cardiac applications and are stored in
   computer memory. Images may be played back in slow motion or frame by
   frame to analyze cardiac motion at the millisecond time scale. Images
   are acquired using the T5 Duke University Phased Array Scanner that
   allows 32: 1 hardware parallel processing in receive and uses a
   defocused transmit beam. Clinical scans of 70 patients at rates of 240
   to 1000 fps showed adequate image quality for diagnostic purpose. We
   anticipate that high temporal resolution cardiac images will enable the
   realization of more accurate and new quantitative descriptors of cardiac
   function in disease and health.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate in this study that natural green rust nanoparticles and
   their synthetic analogs can be complex polycrystalline phases composed
   of crystallites only a few nanometers in size, and they often include
   nanometer-sized regions of amorphous material. The natural green rusts
   are Zn-bearing pseudo-hexagonal platelets previously identified by us in
   the contaminated mine drainage of the former Ronneburg uranium mine in
   Germany (Johnson et al. 2014). We also identified Ni- and Cu-bearing
   green rust platelets in the sediment underlying the drainage outflow 20
   m downstream, and, using dark-field transmission electron microscopy
   (DF-TEM), found that these natural green rusts are not usually
   structurally coherent single crystals. Synthetic sulfate green rusts are
   also polycrystalline and composed of crystallites of only a few
   nanometers in size, though different synthesis conditions produced
   different patterns of polycrystallinity. While pseudo-hexagonal
   platelets are the typical morphology of green rust, we also synthesized
   green rust nanorods, which have not previously been reported. In
   addition to the known characteristics of green rusts (including a very
   large aspect ratio and surface area to volume ratio, and the redox
   properties allowed by the structural mixture of Fe2+ and Fe3+), these
   polycrystalline platelets exhibit a high abundance of defect sites and
   likely a rough surface topography. The combination of these
   characteristics has important implications for the reactivity of green
   rust with biogeochemical interfaces in natural and anthropogenic
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The higher order mixed spectral-element method (SEM) is proposed for the
   analysis of anisotropic, lossy, and open waveguides. The new variational
   formulation incorporating Gauss' law into the vectorial wave equation is
   completely free of spurious modes. It utilizes the edge-based
   curl-conforming Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) polynomials to approximate
   the tangential vector of the electric field and the nodal-based scalar
   GLL basis functions to discretize its longitudinal component to obtain
   the highly accurate solution. By employing the mass-lumping technique,
   only a smaller generalized eigenvalue problem needs to be solved.
   Several numerical examples are given to verify that the mixed SEM is
   free of any spurious eigenmode and has spectral accuracy with the
   propagation constant.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:The authors relate posterior segment microanatomy from perinatal
   spectral domain optical coherence tomography to visual acuity, brain
   abnormalities, and neurodevelopment.Methods:Thirteen infants (11 preterm
   and 2 term birth), imaged in the nursery with portable spectral domain
   optical coherence tomography, had visual acuity and sensorimotor testing
   at age 9 months to 15 months (grating acuity) or 4 years to 5 years
   (optotype), and medical records reviewed for brain magnetic resonance
   imaging reports and Bayley scales testing at age 18 months to 24
   months.Results:Eight children with age-appropriate macular microanatomy
   without edema on perinatal spectral domain optical coherence tomography
   had optimal (20/40) or within normal limits (grating acuity) visual
   acuity. Five children with perinatal macular edema had suboptimal visual
   acuity (in 9/10 eyes) and sensorimotor deficits, magnetic resonance
   imaging abnormalities, or poor neurodevelopment. Macular edema persisted
   in 1 infant through 9-month corrected age.Conclusion:Maturation of the
   visual system and evolution of retinal anomalies can be monitored with
   posterior segment spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Retinal
   microanatomy observed in infancy might relate to subsequent vision and
   other central nervous system events, but additional studies are needed
   to determine the range of normal microanatomy in infants and how this
   relates to vision and neurodevelopment.}},

Abstract = {{Many applications have benefited remarkably from low-dimensional models
   in the recent decade. The fact that many signals, though high
   dimensional, are intrinsically low dimensional has given the possibility
   to recover them stably from a relatively small number of their
   measurements. For example, in compressed sensing with the standard
   (synthesis) sparsity prior and in matrix completion, the number of
   measurements needed is proportional (up to a logarithmic factor) to the
   signal's manifold dimension. Recently, a new natural low-dimensional
   signal model has been proposed: the cosparse analysis prior. In the
   noiseless case, it is possible to recover signals from this model, using
   a combinatorial search, from a number of measurements proportional to
   the signal's manifold dimension. However, if we ask for stability to
   noise or an efficient (polynomial complexity) solver, all the existing
   results demand a number of measurements, which is far removed from the
   manifold dimension, sometimes far greater. Thus, it is natural to ask
   whether this gap is a deficiency of the theory and the solvers, or if
   there exists a real barrier in recovering the cosparse signals by
   relying only on their manifold dimension. Is there an algorithm which,
   in the presence of noise, can accurately recover a cosparse signal from
   a number of measurements proportional to the manifold dimension? In this
   paper, we prove that there is no such algorithm. Furthermore, we show
   through the numerical simulations that even in the noiseless case convex
   relaxations fail when the number of measurements is comparable with the
   manifold dimension. This gives a practical counterexample to the growing
   literature on the compressed acquisition of signals based on manifold
   dimension.}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents the joint performance of heat pumps that are served
   by a common loop buried in the ground, and which operate simultaneously:
   one heat pump absorbs heat from the buried loop whereas the other one

   even when the two heat pumps are not operating. The objective is to
   determine the performance and the manner in which it is affected by the
   way in which the two heat pumps are connected to the loop. The
   performance measures are the heat transfer rates into and out of the
   heat pumps, and the total pumping power required by the assembly. The
   paper documents the individual performance of the heat pumps, and their
   relative performance, which is the ratio of heating absorbed by one pump
   to the heating rejected by the other pump. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   valve disease. Spatially localized cell adhesive ligands bound in the
   scaffold promote cell growth and organization of valve interstitial
   cells and valve endothelial cells in 3D co-culture. Both cell types
   maintained phenotypes, homeostatic functions, and produced zonally
   localized extracellular matrix. This model extends the capabilities of

Abstract = {{The turbulent energy spectra and cospectra of momentum and sensible heat

   cospectral budget model, previously used to explain the bulk relation
   between the turbulent Prandtl number () and the gradient Richardson
   number () as well as the relation between and , is employed to interpret
   field measurements over a lake and a glacier. The shapes of the vertical
   velocity and temperature spectra, needed for closing the cospectral
   budget model, are first examined with increasing . In addition, the
   wavenumber-dependent relaxation time scales for momentum and heat fluxes
   are inferred from the cospectral budgets and investigated. Using
   experimental data and proposed extensions to the cospectral budget
   model, the existence of a `' power-law scaling in the temperature
   spectra but its absence from the vertical velocity spectra is shown to
   reduce the magnitude of the maximum flux Richardson number (), which is
   commonly inferred from the Rf-Ri relation when becomes very large

   potential energy as , which explains the observed disappearance of the
   inertial subrange in the vertical velocity spectra at a smaller as

Abstract = {{Glaucoma is a disease that damages the optic nerve, frequently leading
   to blindness. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable
   risk factor for glaucoma, which is expected to affect 80 million people
   by 2020, causing bilateral blindness in over 10 million individuals.
   Because pathological changes to Schlemm's canal (SC) may account for
   significant resistance to outflow, there is considerable interest in
   characterizing and evaluating the Schlemm's canal as a target for
   glaucoma therapeutics. In conventional, two-dimensional culture, human
   Schlemm's canal (HSC) cells lose spatial, mechanical and biochemical
   cues, resulting in altered gene expression and cell signaling than
   observed in vivo, compromising the clinical relevance of data obtained
   from such systems. Here, we report, for the first time, that 3D culture
   of HSC cells on microfabricated scaffolds with defined physical and
   biochemical cues, rescued expression of key HSC markers, VE-cadherin and
   PECAM1, and mediated pore formation, crucial for the Schlemm's canal
   regulation of IOP. We demonstrated that following treatment with the
   glaucopathogenic agent, TGF-beta 2, HSC cells undergo an endothelial
   mesenchymal transition, which together with the increase in
   extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins might account for the decrease in
   outflow facility observed in patients with high TGF-beta 2 levels in
   their aqueous humor. We also demonstrated that unlike 2D cultures, 3D
   cultures of HSC cells are amenable to gene transfer. Thus, our data
   imply that 3D culture of HSC cells may be used as a platform to advance
   our understanding of HSC physiology and pathology and as a model for
   high-throughput drug and gene screening. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the formulation of Stolt migration is modified for
   impulse borehole radar near-field imaging in the subsurface scenarios
   where the transceiver is widely separated with respect to the detection
   range. The proposed approach consists of the following aspects. First,
   the locations of the transmitter and receiver in the survey are regarded
   as independent sample dimensions, and the original sample set is
   converted to an enlarged virtual sample set. The frequency-wavenumber
   spectrum (FWS) of the virtual sample set is available via
   multidimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then, the relation
   between the angular frequency and wavenumbers of the transmitter and
   receiver is derived in the frame of the virtual sample set, which
   provides the basis for the interpolation in angular frequency and
   weighting process of FWS. By applying multidimensional inverse FFT
   (IFFT) to the interpolated and weighted FWS of the virtual sample set,
   the energy of target responses will focus in some profile of the IFFT
   result, the position of which is related with the separation between the
   transmitter and receiver. Finally, the desired target space can be
   extracted from the IFFT result. The improved Stolt migration technique
   is compared with the conventional Stolt migration algorithm,
   back-projection method, and Kirchhoff migration algorithm on synthetic
   data and validated by single-borehole radar experiment in the subsurface
   scenario. The results show that the developed Stolt migration is
   superior to the conventional methods in cross-range resolution,
   computational cost, and the ability to reconstruct locations and shapes
   of targets.}},

Abstract = {{Radio emissions continue to provide insight into the production of
   terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) by thunderstorms, including the
   critical question of the conditions under which they are generated. We
   have identified several TGF-associated lightning radio emissions in
   which the altitudes of in-cloud lightning leader pulses that precede and
   follow the TGF can be measured. We combine these with high absolute
   timing accuracy TGF observations from the Fermi satellite to determine
   the development of the lightning channel before, during, and after the
   TGF production. All of these TGFs were produced several milliseconds
   after the leader had initiated and when the leaders reached 1-2 km in
   length. After the TGFs, the leaders all continued to ascend for several
   more kilometers with no dramatic change in their characteristics,
   although they all exhibited high average velocities of 0.8-1.0 x 10(6)
   m/s. Implications in the context of TGF models are discussed. These
   results paint the first clear picture of the lightning processes that
   occur before, during, and after TGF production.}},

Abstract = {{With a perfectly defined primary structure, both in terms of monomer
   sequence and chain length, recombinant polypeptides obtained by protein
   engineering techniques allow the investigation of structure property
   relationships at a level of detail that is difficult to achieve with
   traditional synthetic polymers because of the precision with which their
   sequence can be defined. In the present work, we have studied the
   behavior and temperature-triggered self-assembly of a series of diblock
   recombinant elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) with the goal of
   elucidating the mechanism of their self-assembly into micelles. Aqueous
   solutions of diblock ELPs were studied below and above their critical
   micellar temperature (CMT) by multiangle light scattering and
   small-angle neutron scattering techniques. Below the CMT, the radius of
   gyration of soluble ELP chains follows a power law as a function of
   molecular weight with an exponent value close to 0.5 that is
   characteristic of Gaussian coil conformations. As the temperature
   reaches the CMT, attractive interactions between the more hydrophobic
   block of diblock ELP chains leads to the self-assembly of monodisperse
   spherical micelles at thermodynamic equilibrium. Above the CMT, micelles
   expel water molecules from their core whose densification is evidenced
   by the monotonic increase in the light and neutron scattering
   intensities as a function of temperature. The behaviors of these
   different diblock ELPs in solution and as self-assembled nanoparticles
   above the CMT following universal experimental scaling laws make them
   analogous to synthetic amphiphilic diblock copolymers (star-like vs
   crew-cut micelle models). These studies also shed light on the important
   role of water in the thermal behavior of these thermally responsive
   self-assembling diblock polypeptides and suggest a new design parameter
   thermally triggered desolvation and densification of the core of
   micelles that can be fine-tuned at the sequence level to control the
   density of self-assembled polymer nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{This review presents and applies fundamental mass transport theory
   describing the diffusion and convection driven mass transport of drugs
   to the vaginal environment. It considers sources of variability in the
   predictions of the models. It illustrates use of model predictions of
   microbicide drug concentration distribution (pharmacokinetics) to gain
   insights about drug effectiveness in preventing HIV infection
   (pharmacodynamics). The modeling compares vaginal drug distributions
   after different gel dosage regimens, and it evaluates consequences of
   changes in gel viscosity due to aging. It compares vaginal mucosal
   concentration distributions of drugs delivered by gels vs. intravaginal
   rings. Finally, the modeling approach is used to compare vaginal drug
   distributions across species with differing vaginal dimensions.
   Deterministic models of drug mass transport into and throughout the
   vaginal environment can provide critical insights about the mechanisms
   and determinants of such transport. This knowledge, and the methodology
   that obtains it, can be applied and translated to multiple applications,
   involving the scientific underpinnings of vaginal drug distribution and
   the performance evaluation and design of products, and their dosage
   regimens, that achieve it. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and enrichment of naturally occurring radioactive
   materials (NORM) in coal combustion residuals (CCRs) from different coal
   source basins have not been fully characterized in the United States.
   Here we provide a systematic analysis of the occurrence of NORM (Th-232,
   Ra-228, (238)u, Ra-226, and Pb-210) in coals and associated CCRs from
   the Illinois, Appalachian, and Powder River Basins. Illinois CCRs had
   the highest total Ra (Ra-228 + Ra-226 = 297 +/- 46 Bq/kg) and the lowest
   Ra-228/Ra-226 activity ratio (0.31 +/- 0.09), followed by Appalachian
   CCRs (283 +/- 34 Bq/kg; 0.67 +/- 0.09), and Powder River CCRs (213 +/-
   21 Bq/kg; 0.79 +/- 0.10). Total Ra and Ra-228/Ra-226 variations in CCRs
   correspond to the U and Th concentrations and ash contents of their feed
   coals, and we show that these relationships can be used to predict total
   NORM concentrations in CCRs. We observed differential NORM volatility
   during combustion that results in Pb-210 enrichment and (210)pb/Ra-226
   ratios greater than 1 in most fly-ash samples. Overall, total NORM
   activities in CCRs are 7-10- and 3-5-fold higher than NORM activities in
   parent coals and average U.S. soil, respectively. This study lays the
   groundwork for future research related to the environmental and human
   health implications of CCR disposal and accidental release to the
   environment in the context of this elevated radioactivity.}},

Title = {{Aligned multilayered electrospun scaffolds for rotator cuff tendon
   tissue engineering}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{117-126}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The rotator cuff consists of several tendons and muscles that provide
   stability and force transmission in the shoulder joint. Whereas most
   rotator cuff tears are amenable to suture repair, the overall success
   rate of repair is low, and massive tears are prone to re-tear.
   Extracellular matrix (ECM) patches are used to augment suture repair,
   but they have limitations. Tissue-engineered approaches provide a
   promising solution for massive rotator cuff tears. Previous studies have
   shown that, compared to nonaligned scaffolds, aligned electrospun
   polymer scaffolds exhibit greater anisotropy and exert a greater
   tenogenic effect. Nevertheless, achieving rapid cell infiltration
   through the full thickness of the scaffold is challenging, and scaling
   to a translationally relevant size may be difficult. Our goal was to
   evaluate whether a novel method of alignment, combining a multilayered
   electrospinning technique with a hybrid of several electrospinning
   alignment techniques, would permit cell infiltration and collagen
   deposition through the thickness of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) scaffolds
   following seeding with human adipose-derived stem cells. Furthermore, we
   evaluated whether multilayered aligned scaffolds enhanced collagen
   alignment, tendon-related gene expression, and mechanical properties
   compared to multilayered nonaligned scaffolds. Both aligned and
   nonaligned multilayered scaffolds demonstrated cell infiltration and ECM
   deposition through the full thickness of the scaffold after only 28 days
   of culture. Aligned scaffolds displayed significantly increased
   expression of tenomodulin compared to nonaligned scaffolds and exhibited
   aligned collagen fibrils throughout the full thickness, the presence of
   which may account for the increased yield stress and Young's modulus of
   cell-seeded aligned scaffolds along the axis of fiber alignment.
   Statement of Significance
   Rotator cuff tears are an important clinical problem in the shoulder,
   with over 300,000 surgical repairs performed annually. Re-tear rates may
   be high, and current methods used to augment surgical repair have
   limited evidence to support their clinical use due to inadequate initial
   mechanical properties and slow cellular infiltration. Tissue engineering
   approaches such as electrospinning have shown similar challenges in
   previous studies. In this study, a novel technique to align electrospun
   fibers while using a multilayered approach demonstrated increased
   mechanical properties and development of aligned collagen through the
   full thickness of the scaffolds compared to nonaligned multilayered
   scaffolds, and both types of scaffolds demonstrated rapid cell
   infiltration through the full thickness of the scaffold. (C) 2015 Acta

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{708-725}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the performances of lightly- and heavily-damped
   rolling isolation systems (RISs) located within earthquake-excited
   structures. Six steel structures of varying height and stiffness are
   selected so as to represent a range of potential RIS installations.
   Computation models of representative frames from each of the six
   structures are reduced through dynamic condensation and assembled with
   models for biaxial isotropic hysteretic behavior within each floor. A
   novel reduced order modeling approach is presented in this paper. The
   method combines a dynamic condensation of a linear-elastic frame with
   the inelastic-push over curve for a detailed elastic-plastic frame model
   and a novel bi-axial hysteretic model for the net inter-story inelastic
   behavior. The reduced inelastic model combines stiffness and mass
   matrices from the reduced linear model with the hi-axial inelastic floor
   model, and is subsequently fit to push-over curves from the detailed
   hysteretic model. The resulting reduced order model has three
   coordinates per floor and provides a much simpler model for simulating
   the floor responses of inelastic structures. The resulting inelastic
   structural models are isotropic in plan and uniform along the height.
   Suites of recorded ground motions representative of near-fault and
   far-field hazards are scaled and inputted into these hysteretic reduced
   models. The bidirectional floor responses at varying heights are then
   applied to experimentally-validated models of lightly- and
   heavily-damped RISs. Empirical cumulative distribution functions of peak
   isolator responses (relative displacement and total acceleration) for
   the two systems are compared, from which installation guidelines are
   presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Accurate localized resolution of identity approach for linear-scaling

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{A key component in calculations of exchange and correlation energies is
   the Coulomb operator, which requires the evaluation of two-electron
   integrals. For localized basis sets, these four-center integrals are
   most efficiently evaluated with the resolution of identity (RI)
   technique, which expands basis-function products in an auxiliary basis.
   In this work we show the practical applicability of a localized
   RI-variant ('RI-LVL'), which expands products of basis functions only in
   the subset of those auxiliary basis functions which are located at the
   same atoms as the basis functions. We demonstrate the accuracy of RI-LVL
   for Hartree-Fock calculations, for the PBE0 hybrid density functional,
   as well as for RPA and MP2 perturbation theory. Molecular test sets used
   include the S22 set of weakly interacting molecules, the G3 test set, as
   well as the G2-1 and BH76 test sets, and heavy elements including
   titanium dioxide, copper and gold clusters. Our RI-LVL implementation
   paves the way for linear-scaling RI-based hybrid functional calculations
   for large systems and for all-electron many-body perturbation theory
   with significantly reduced computational and memory cost.}},

   protocol of a randomized clinical trial on tele-rehabilitation for
   stroke patients}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most acute stroke patients with disabilities do not receive
   recommended rehabilitation following discharge to the community.
   Functional and social barriers are common reasons for non-adherence to
   post-discharge rehabilitation. Home rehabilitation is an alternative to
   centre-based rehabilitation but is costlier. Tele-rehabilitation is a
   possible solution, allowing for remote supervision of rehabilitation and
   eliminating access barriers. The objective of the Singapore
   Tele-technology Aided Rehabilitation in Stroke (STARS) trial is to
   determine if a novel tele-rehabilitation intervention for the first
   three months after stroke admission improves functional recovery
   compared to usual care.
   Methods/design: This is a single blind (evaluator blinded), parallel,
   two-arm randomised controlled trial study design involving 100 recent
   stroke patients. The inclusion criteria are age >= 40 years, having
   caregiver support and recent stroke defined as stroke diagnosis within 4
   weeks. Consenting participants will be randomized with varying block
   size of 4 or 6 assuming a 1: 1 treatment allocation with the
   participating centre as the stratification factor. The baseline
   assessment will be done within 4 weeks of stroke onset, followed by
   follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. The tele-rehabilitation
   intervention lasts for 3 months and includes exercise 5-days-a-week
   using an iPad-based system that allows recording of daily exercise with
   video and sensor data and weekly video-conferencing with tele-therapists
   after data review. Those allocated to the control group will receive
   usual care. The primary outcome measure is improvement in life task's
   social activity participation at three months as measured by the
   disability component of the Jette Late Life Functional and Disability
   Instrument (LLFDI). Secondary outcome variables consist of gait speed
   (Timed 5-Meter Walk Test) and endurance (Two-Minute Walk test),
   performance of basic activities of daily living (Shah-modified Barthel
   Index), balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence
   Scale), patient self-reported health-related quality-of-life {[}Euro-QOL
   (EQ-5D)], health service utilization (Singapore Stroke Study Health
   Service Utilization Form) and caregiver reported stress (Zarit Caregiver
   Burden Inventory).
   Discussion: The goal of this trial is to provide evidence on the
   potential benefit and cost-effectiveness of this novel
   tele-rehabilitation programme which will guide health care
   decision-making and potentially improve performance of post-stroke
   community-based rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Current guidelines by WHO for cervical cancer screening in low- and
   middle-income countries involves visual inspection with acetic acid
   (VIA) of the cervix, followed by treatment during the same visit or a
   subsequent visit with cryotherapy if a suspicious lesion is found.
   Implementation of these guidelines is hampered by a lack of: trained
   health workers, reliable technology, and access to screening facilities.
   A low cost ultra-portable Point of Care Tampon based digital colposcope
   (POCkeT Colposcope) for use at the community level setting, which has
   the unique form factor of a tampon, can be inserted into the vagina to
   capture images of the cervix, which are on par with that of a state of
   the art colposcope, at a fraction of the cost. A repository of images to
   be compiled that can be used to empower front line workers to become
   more effective through virtual dynamic training. By task shifting to the
   community setting, this technology could potentially provide
   significantly greater cervical screening access to where the most
   vulnerable women live. The POCkeT Colposcope's concentric LED ring
   provides comparable white and green field illumination at a fraction of
   the electrical power required in commercial colposcopes. Evaluation with
   standard optical imaging targets to assess the POCkeT Colposcope against
   the state of the art digital colposcope and other VIAM technologies.
   Results
   Our POCkeT Colposcope has comparable resolving power, color reproduction
   accuracy, minimal lens distortion, and illumination when compared to
   commercially available colposcopes. In vitro and pilot in vivo imaging
   results are promising with our POCkeT Colposcope capturing comparable
   quality images to commercial systems.
   Conclusion
   The POCkeT Colposcope is capable of capturing images suitable for
   cervical lesion analysis. Our portable low cost system could potentially
   increase access to cervical cancer screening in limited resource
   settings through task shifting to community health workers.}},

Title = {{Waste-aware single-target dilution of a biochemical fluid using digital
   microfluidic biochips}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATION-THE VLSI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{194-207}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A key challenge in design automation of digital microfluidic biochips is
   to carry out on-chip dilution/mixing of biochemical samples/reagents for
   achieving a desired concentration factor (CF). In a bioassay, reducing
   the waste is crucial because the management of waste droplets is
   cumbersome and expensive; transporting them to the waste reservoir and
   washing their pathways to clean contaminated regions and remove the
   residue left by them may increase assay completion time. The existing
   dilution algorithms attempt to reduce the number of mix-split steps
   required in the process but focus little on the minimization of sample
   requirement or waste droplets. In this work, we characterize the
   underlying combinatorial properties of waste generation and identify the
   inherent limitations of two earlier mixing algorithms two WayMix (Thies
   et al., Natural Computing, 2008) {[}11] and DMRW (Roy et al., TCAD,
   2010) {[}12] in addressing this issue. Based on these properties, we
   design an improved dilution/mixing algorithm (IDMA) that optimizes the
   usage of intermediate droplets generated during the dilution process,
   which in turn, reduces the demand of sample/reagent and production of
   waste. The algorithm terminates in O(d) steps for producing a target CF
   with a maximum error of 1/2(d+1), where d is the an accuracy level of
   the desired CF. Based on simulation results for all CF values, ranging
   from 1/1024 to 1023/1024 using a sample (100\% concentration) and a
   buffer solution (0\% concentration), we present an integrated scheme of
   choosing the best waste-aware dilution algorithm among four approaches
   such as two WayMix, DMRW, REMIA (Huang et al., ICCAD, 2012) {[}13] and
   IDMA, for a single target CF. Finally, an architectural layout of a DMF
   biochip that supports the proposed scheme is designed. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{While the importance of ecosystem functioning is undisputed in the
   context of climate change and Earth system modeling, the role of
   short-scale temporal variability of hydrometeorological forcing (similar
   to 1h) on the related ecosystem processes remains to be fully
   understood. Various impacts of meteorological forcing variability on
   water and carbon fluxes across a range of scales are explored here using
   numerical simulations. Synthetic meteorological drivers that highlight
   dynamic features of the short temporal scale in series of precipitation,
   temperature, and radiation are constructed. These drivers force a
   mechanistic ecohydrological model that propagates information content
   into the dynamics of water and carbon fluxes for an ensemble of
   representative ecosystems. The focus of the analysis is on a cross-scale
   effect of the short-scale forcing variability on the modeled
   evapotranspiration and ecosystem carbon assimilation. Interannual
   variability of water and carbon fluxes is emphasized in the analysis.
   The main study inferences are summarized as follows: (a) short-scale
   variability of meteorological input does affect water and carbon fluxes
   across a wide range of time scales, spanning from the hourly to the
   annual and longer scales; (b) different ecosystems respond to the
   various characteristics of the short-scale variability of the climate
   forcing in various ways, depending on dominant factors limiting system
   productivity; (c) whenever short-scale variability of meteorological
   forcing influences primarily fast processes such as photosynthesis, its
   impact on the slow-scale variability of water and carbon fluxes is
   small; and (d) whenever short-scale variability of the meteorological
   forcing impacts slow processes such as movement and storage of water in
   the soil, the effects of the variability can propagate to annual and
   longer time scales.}},

Abstract = {{Configurational disorder can be compositionally engineered into mixed
   oxide by populating a single sublattice with many distinct cations. The
   formulations promote novel and entropy-stabilized forms of crystalline
   matter where metal cations are incorporated in new ways. Here, through
   rigorous experiments, a simple thermodynamic model, and a five-component
   oxide formulation, we demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that entropy
   predominates the thermodynamic landscape, and drives a reversible
   solid-state transformation between a multiphase and single-phase state.
   In the latter, cation distributions are proven to be random and
   homogeneous. The findings validate the hypothesis that deliberate
   configurational disorder provides an orthogonal strategy to imagine and
   discover new phases of crystalline matter and untapped opportunities for
   property engineering.}},

Pages = {{21746-21759}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This article presents our most recent advances in synchronous
   fluorescence (SF) methodology for biomedical diagnostics. The SF method
   is characterized by simultaneously scanning both the excitation and
   emission wavelengths while keeping a constant wavelength interval
   between them. Compared to conventional fluorescence spectroscopy, the SF
   method simplifies the emission spectrum while enabling greater
   selectivity, and has been successfully used to detect subtle differences
   in the fluorescence emission signatures of biochemical species in cells
   and tissues. The SF method can be used in imaging to analyze dysplastic
   cells in vitro and tissue in vivo. Based on the SF method, here we
   demonstrate the feasibility of a time-resolved synchronous fluorescence
   (TRSF) method, which incorporates the intrinsic fluorescent decay
   characteristics of the fluorophores. Our prototype TRSF system has
   clearly shown its advantage in spectro-temporal separation of the
   fluorophores that were otherwise difficult to spectrally separate in SF
   spectroscopy. We envision that our previously-tested SF imaging and the
   newly-developed TRSF methods will combine their proven diagnostic
   potentials in cancer diagnosis to further improve the efficacy of
   SF-based biomedical diagnostics.}},

Title = {{Accurate Analysis and Prediction of Enterprise Service-Level Performance}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An enterprise service-level performance time series is a sequence of
   data points that quantify demand, throughput, average order-delivery
   time, quality of service, or end-to-end cost. Analytical and predictive
   models of such time series can be embedded into an enterprise
   information system (EIS) in order to provide meaningful insights into
   potential business problems and generate guidance for appropriate
   solutions. Time-series analysis includes periodicity detection,
   decomposition, and correlation analysis. Time-series prediction can be
   modeled as a regression problem to forecast a sequence of future
   time-series datapoints based on the given time series. The
   state-of-the-art (baseline) methods employed in time-series prediction
   generally apply advanced machine-learning algorithms. In this article,
   we propose a new univariate method for dealing with midterm time-series
   prediction. The proposed method first analyzes the hierarchical periodic
   structure in one time series and decomposes it into trend, season, and
   noise components. By discarding the noise component, the proposed method
   only focuses on predicting repetitive season and smoothed trend
   components. As a result, this method significantly improves upon the
   performance of baseline methods in midterm time-series prediction.
   Moreover, we propose a new multivariate method for dealing with
   short-term time-series prediction. The proposed method utilizes
   cross-correlation information derived from multiple time series. The
   amount of data taken from each time series for training the regression
   model is determined by results from hierarchical cross-correlation
   analysis. Such a data-filtering strategy leads to improved algorithm
   efficiency and prediction accuracy. By combining statistical methods
   with advanced machine-learning algorithms, we have achieved a
   significantly superior performance in both short-term and midterm
   time-series predictions compared to state-of-the-art (baseline) methods.}},

   architecture for targeting defects in dies and in the interposer
   interconnects. The proposed BIST architecture can also be used for fault
   diagnosis during interconnect testing. To reduce the overall test cost,
   we describe a test scheduling and optimization technique under power
   constraints. We present simulation results to validate the BIST
   architecture and demonstrate fault detection, synthesis results to
   evaluate the area overhead of the proposed BIST architecture, and test
   scheduling results to highlight the effectiveness of the optimization

Abstract = {{The optimal design of a compound helicopter comprised of counterrotating
   coaxial rotors, a propeller, and optionally a fixed wing is
   investigated. The blade geometry, azimuthal blade pitch inputs, optimal
   shaft angle (rotor angle of attack), and division of propulsive and
   lifting forces among the components that minimize the total power for a
   given flight condition are determined. The optimal design problem is
   cast as a variational statement that minimizes the sum of induced and
   viscous power losses for a prescribed lift, propulsive force, and
   vehicle trim condition. The rotor, propeller, and wing geometry and
   control inputs are related to the far-field circulation through a
   lifting-line model that accounts for experimentally or computationally
   determined nonlinear lift and drag polars. The variational statement is
   discretized using a vortex lattice wake, and the resulting nonlinear
   constrained optimization problem is solved via Newton iteration. Results
   show that varying the prescribed propulsive force of the system affects
   the optimal shaft angle and rotor design, that higher harmonic control
   reduces the total vehicle power loss (inefficiency) in high-speed flight
   by as much as 15\%, and that imposing a maximum allowable lateral lift
   offset can greatly increase the power loss of the coaxial rotors.}},

Abstract = {{Tactile information processing in the rodent primary somatosensory
   cortex (S1) is layer specific and involves modulations from both
   thalamocortical and cortico-cortical loops. However, the extent to which
   these loops influence the dynamics of the primary somatosensory cortex
   while animals execute tactile discrimination remains largely unknown.
   Here, we describe neural dynamics of S1 layers across the multiple
   epochs defining a tactile discrimination task. We observed that neuronal
   ensembles within different layers of the S1 cortex exhibited
   significantly distinct neurophysiological properties, which constantly
   changed across the behavioral states that defined a tactile
   discrimination. Neural dynamics present in supragranular and granular
   layers generally matched the patterns observed in the ventral posterior
   medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM), whereas the neural dynamics
   recorded from infragranular layers generally matched the patterns from
   the posterior nucleus of the thalamus (POM). Selective inactivation of
   contralateral S1 specifically switched infragranular neural dynamics
   from POM-like to those resembling VPM neurons. Meanwhile, ipsilateral M1
   inactivation profoundly modulated the firing suppression observed in
   infragranular layers. This latter effect was counterbalanced by
   contralateral S1 block. Tactile stimulus encoding was layer specific and
   selectively affected by M1 or contralateral S1 inactivation. Lastly,
   causal information transfer occurred between all neurons in all S1
   layers but was maximal from infragranular to the granular layer. These
   results suggest that tactile information processing in the S1 of awake
   behaving rodents is layer specific and state dependent and that its
   dynamics depend on the asynchronous convergence of modulations
   originating from ipsilateral M1 and contralateral S1.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanochemically responsive (MCR) polymers have been synthesized by
   incorporating mechanophores - molecules whose chemical reactions are
   triggered by mechanical force - into conventional polymer networks.
   Deformation of the MCR polymers applies force on the mechanophores and
   triggers their reactions, which manifest as phenomena such as changing
   colors, varying fluorescence and releasing molecules. While the
   activation of most existing MCR polymers requires irreversible plastic
   deformation or fracture of the polymers, we covalently coupled
   mechanophores into the backbone chains of elastomer networks, achieving
   MCR elastomers that can be repeatedly activated over multiple cycles of
   large and reversible deformations. This paper reports a microphysical
   model of MCR elastomers, which quantitatively captures the interplay
   between the macroscopic deformation of the MCR elastomers and the
   reversible activation of mechanophores on polymer chains with
   non-uniform lengths. Our model consistently predicts both the
   stress-strain behaviors and the color or fluorescence variation of the
   MCR elastomers under large deformations. We quantitatively explain that
   MCR elastomers with time-independent stress-strain behaviors can give
   time-dependent variation of color or fluorescence due to the kinetics of
   mechanophore activation and that MCR elastomers with different
   chain-length distributions can exhibit similar stress-strain behaviors
   but very different colors or fluorescence. Implementing the model into
   ABAQUS subroutine further demonstrates our model's capability in guiding
   the design of MCR elastomeric devices for applications such as
   large-strain imaging and color and fluorescence displays. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The first cases of underwater blast injury appeared in the scientific
   literature in 1917, and thousands of service members and civilians were
   injured or killed by underwater blast during WWII. The prevalence of
   underwater blast injuries and occupational blasting needs led to the
   development of many safety standards to prevent injury or death. Most of
   these standards were not supported by experimental data or testing. In
   this review, we describe existing standards, discuss their origins, and
   we comprehensively compare their prescriptions across standards.
   Surprisingly, we found that most safety standards had little or no
   scientific basis, and prescriptions across standards often varied by at
   least an order of magnitude. Many published standards traced back to a
   US Navy 500 psi guideline, which was intended to provide a peak pressure
   at which injuries were likely to occur. This standard itself seems to
   have been based upon a completely unfounded assertion that has
   propagated throughout the literature in subsequent years. Based on the
   limitations of the standards discussed, we outline future directions for
   underwater blast injury research, such as the compilation of
   epidemiological data to examine actual injury risk by human beings
   subjected to underwater blasts.}},

Abstract = {{P300 spellers can provide a means of communication for individuals with
   severe neuromuscular limitations. However, its use as an effective
   communication tool is reliant on high P300 classification accuracies
   (>70\%) to account for error revisions. Error-related potentials (ErrP),
   which are changes in EEG potentials when a person is aware of or
   perceives erroneous behavior or feedback, have been proposed as inputs
   to drive corrective mechanisms that veto erroneous actions by BCI
   systems. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that training an
   additional ErrP classifier for a P300 speller is not necessary, as we
   hypothesize that error information is encoded in the P300 classifier
   responses used for character selection. We perform offline simulations
   of P300 spelling to compare ErrP and non-ErrP based corrective
   algorithms. A simple dictionary correction based on string matching and
   word frequency significantly improved accuracy (35-185\%), in contrast
   to an ErrP-based method that flagged, deleted and replaced erroneous
   characters (-47 - 0\%). Providing additional information about the
   likelihood of characters to a dictionary-based correction further
   improves accuracy. Our Bayesian dictionary-based correction algorithm
   that utilizes P300 classifier confidences performed comparably
   (44-416\%) to an oracle ErrP dictionary-based method that assumed
   perfect ErrP classification (43-433\%).}},

Abstract = {{Aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) synthesized by the
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method have exceptional potential for
   next-generation nanoelectronics. However, the coexistence of
   semiconducting (s-) and metallic (m-) SWNTs remains a considerable
   challenge since the latter causes significant degradation in device
   performance. Here we demonstrate a facile and effective approach to
   selectively break all m-SWNTs by stacking two layers of horizontally
   aligned SWNTs to form crossbars and applying a voltage to the crossed
   SWNT arrays. The introduction of SWNT junctions amplifies the disparity
   in resistance between s- and m-pathways, leading to a complete
   deactivation of m-SWNTs while minimizing the degradation of the
   semiconducting counterparts. Unlike previous approaches that required an
   electrostatic gate to achieve selectivity in electrical breakdown, this
   junction process is gate-free and opens the way for straightforward
   integration of thin-film s-SWNT devices. Comparison to electrical
   breakdown in junction-less SWNT devices without gating shows that this
   junction-based breakdown method yields more than twice the average
   on-state current retention in the resultant s-SWNT arrays. Systematic
   studies show that the on/off ratio can reach as high as 1.4 X 10(6) with
   a correspondingly high retention of on-state current compared to the
   initial current value before breakdown. Overall, this method provides
   important insight into transport at SWNT junctions and a simple route
   for obtaining pure s-SWNT thin film devices for broad applications.}},

Abstract = {{To maximize the collection efficiency of back-scattered light, and to
   minimize aberrations and vignetting, the lateral position of the scan
   pivot of an optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal scanner should be
   imaged to the center of the ocular pupil. Additionally, several retinal
   structures including Henle's Fiber Layer (HFL) exhibit reflectivities
   that depend on illumination angle, which can be controlled by varying
   the pupil entry position of the OCT beam. In this work, we describe an
   automated method for controlling the lateral pupil entry position in
   retinal OCT by utilizing pupil tracking in conjunction with a 2D fast
   steering mirror placed conjugate to the retinal plane. We demonstrate
   that pupil tracking prevents lateral motion artifacts from impeding
   desired pupil entry locations, and enables precise pupil entry
   positioning and therefore control of the illumination angle of incidence
   at the retinal plane. We use our prototype pupil tracking OCT system to
   directly visualize the obliquely oriented HFL. (C) 2015 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Copper (Cu) contamination has become a global concern because of
   industrial, agricultural, and other anthropogenic activities. In the
   present experiments, the toxicological effects, mechanisms, and
   potential toxicity thresholds were investigated in the roots of Vicia
   faba L. seedlings that were cultivated in Cu-amended soils (0, 6.25,
   12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 mg kg(-1)) for 20 days, based on an
   analysis of the soil physicochemical properties, native Cu, available
   Cu, and root-enriched Cu contents. The superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) isozymes and
   activities, as well as glutathione (GSH) and heat shock protein 70
   (HSP70), changed like biphasic dose-response curves, cooperating to
   control the redox homeostasis. The APX and POD enzymes exhibited
   enhanced activities and became H2O2 scavengers primarily when the
   catalase (CAT) activities tended to decrease. Endoprotease (EP) isozymes
   and activities might be enhanced to degrade carbonylated proteins and
   alleviate metabolic disturbance in the roots. Additionally, HSP70 may
   not be suitable as a biomarker for relatively higher soil Cu
   concentrations and relatively longer exposure times for the roots. As a
   result, the isozymes and activities of SOD, CAT, and EP, as well as GSH,
   can be adopted as the most sensitive biomarkers. The toxicity threshold
   is estimated as 0.76-1.21 mg kg(-1) of available Cu in the soils or
   25.04-36.65 mu g Cu g(-1) dry weights (DW) in the roots.}},

Abstract = {{Marine seismic surveys use intense (eg >= 230 decibel {[}dB] root mean
   square {[}RMS]) sound impulses to explore the ocean bottom for
   hydrocarbon deposits, conduct geophysical research, and establish
   resource claims under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
   Sea. The expansion of seismic surveys necessitates greater regional and
   international dialogue, partnerships, and planning to manage potential
   environmental risks. Data indicate several reasons for concern about the
   negative impacts of anthropogenic noise on numerous marine species,
   including habitat displacement, disruption of biologically important
   behaviors, masking of communication signals, chronic stress, and
   potential auditory damage. The sound impulses from seismic surveys -
   spanning temporal and spatial scales broader than those typically
   considered in environmental assessments - may have acute, cumulative,
   and chronic effects on marine organisms. Given the international and
   transboundary nature of noise from marine seismic surveys, we suggest
   the creation of an international regulatory instrument, potentially an
   annex to the existing International Convention on the Prevention of
   Pollution from Ships, to address the issue.}},

Title = {{The Evolution of Tissue Stiffness at Radiofrequency Ablation Sites
   During Lesion Formation and in the Peri-Ablation Period}},

Abstract = {{Peri-Ablation Monitoring of RFA Lesion Stiffness
   IntroductionElastography imaging can provide radiofrequency ablation
   (RFA) lesion assessment due to tissue stiffening at the ablation site.
   An important aspect of assessment is the spatial and temporal stability
   of the region of stiffness increase in the peri-ablation period. The aim
   of this study was to use 2 ultrasound-based elastography techniques,
   shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) and acoustic radiation force
   impulse (ARFI) imaging, to monitor the evolution of tissue stiffness at
   ablation sites in the 30 minutes following lesion creation.
   Methods and ResultsIn 6 canine subjects, SWEI measurements and 2-D ARFI
   images were acquired at 6 ventricular endocardial RFA sites before,
   during, and for 30 minutes postablation. An immediate increase in tissue
   stiffness was detected during RFA, and the area of the postablation
   region of stiffness increase (RoSI) as well as the relative stiffness at
   the RoSI center was stable approximately 2 minutes after ablation. Of
   note is the observation that relative stiffness in the region adjacent
   to the RoSI increased slightly during the first 15 minutes, consistent
   with local fluid displacement or edema. The magnitude of this increase,
   approximate to 0.5-fold from baseline, was significantly less than the
   magnitude of the stiffness increase directly inside the RoSI, which was
   greater than 3-fold from baseline.
   ConclusionsUltrasound-based SWEI and ARFI imaging detected an immediate
   increase in tissue stiffness during RFA, and the stability and magnitude
   of the stiffness change suggest that consistent elasticity-based lesion
   assessment is possible 2 minutes after and for at least 30 minutes
   following ablation.}},

Title = {{A dynamical system approach to soil salinity and sodicity}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{68-76}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Soil salinity and sodicity impose severe constrains to agriculture,
   especially in arid and semi-arid regions, where good-quality water for
   irrigation is scarce. While detailed models have been proposed in the
   past to describe the dynamics of salt and sodium in the soil, they
   typically require cumbersome calculations and are not amenable to
   theoretical analysis. Here we present an analytical model for the
   dynamics of salinity and sodicity in the root zone. We determine the
   dependence of steady-state salinity and sodicity levels on irrigation
   water quality and derive the trajectories in the phase space. The only
   stationary solution the equations admit is a stable node. Through
   numerical integration and analysis of the eigenvalues of the derived
   two-dimensional system of equations, the slower time scale associated
   with sodification is quantified with respect to the faster time scale
   associated to salinization. The role of different cation exchange
   equations (Capon and Vanselow conventions) are shown to be practically
   the same with regard to the phase-space dynamics and the time scales.
   The results can be applied in controlling for low levels of salinity and
   sodicity, and in planning remediation strategies that are timely and
   economical. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Electric Field Model of Transcranial Electric Stimulation in Nonhuman
   Primates: Correspondence to Individual Motor Threshold}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop a pipeline for realistic head models of nonhuman
   primates (NHPs) for simulations of non-invasive brain stimulation, and
   use these models together with empirical threshold measurements to
   demonstrate that the models capture individual anatomical variability.
   Methods: Based on structural MRI data, we created models of the electric
   field (E-field) induced by right unilateral (RUL) electroconvulsive
   therapy (ECT) in four rhesus macaques. Individual motor threshold (MT)
   was measured with transcranial electric stimulation (TES) administered
   through the RUL electrodes in the same subjects. Results: The
   interindividual anatomical differences resulted in 57\% variation in
   median E-field strength in the brain at fixed stimulus current
   amplitude. Individualization of the stimulus current by MT reduced the
   E-field variation in the target motor area by 27\%. There was
   significant correlation between the measured MT and the ratio of
   simulated electrode current and E-field strength (r(2) = 0.95, p =
   0.026). Exploratory analysis revealed significant correlations of this
   ratio with anatomical parameters including of the superior
   electrode-to-cortex distance, vertex-to-cortex distance, and brain
   volume (r(2) > 0.96, p < 0.02). The neural activation threshold was
   estimated to be 0.45 +/- 0.07 V/cm for 0.2-ms stimulus pulse width.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that our individual-specific NHP
   E-field models appropriately capture individual anatomical variability
   relevant to the dosing of TES/ECT. These findings are exploratory due to
   the small number of subjects. Significance: This study can contribute
   insight in NHP studies of ECT and other brain stimulation interventions,
   help link the results to clinical studies, and ultimately lead to more
   rational brain stimulation dosing paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) integration is an attractive technology platform
   for next-generation ICs. Despite the benefits offered by 3-D
   integration, test cost remains a major concern, and analysis and tools
   are needed to understand test flows and minimize test cost. We propose a
   generic cost model to account for various test costs involved in 3-D
   integration and present a formal representation of the solution space to
   minimize the overall cost. We present an algorithm based on A{*}-a
   best-first search technique-to obtain an optimal solution. An
   approximation algorithm with provable bounds on optimality is proposed
   to further reduce the search space. In contrast to prior work, which is
   based on explicit enumeration of test flows, we adopt a formal
   optimization approach, which allows us to select an effective test flow
   by systematically exploring an exponentially large number of candidate
   test flows. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the
   proposed method. Adopting a formal approach to solving the
   cost-minimization problem provides useful insights that cannot be
   derived via selective enumeration of a smaller number of candidate test
   flows.}},

Abstract = {{We present a data-calibrated compact model of carbon nanotube (CNT) FETs
   (CNFETs), including contact resistance, direct source-to-drain, and
   band-to-band tunneling currents. The model captures the effects of
   dimensional scaling and performance degradations due to parasitic
   effects, and is used to study the tradeoffs between the drive current
   and the leakage current of CNFETs according to the selection of CNT
   diameter, CNT density, contact length, and gate length for a target
   contacted gate pitch. We describe a co-optimization study of CNFET
   device parameters near the limits of scaling with physical insight, and
   project the CNFET performance at the 5-nm technology node with an
   estimated contacted gate pitch of 31 nm. Based on the analysis,
   including parasitic resistance, capacitance, and tunneling leakage
   current, a CNT density of 180 CNTs/mu m will enable the CNFET technology
   to meet the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors target
   of drive current (1.33 mA/mu m), which is within reach of modern
   experimental capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a nonlinear state-space-based identification method is
   proposed to describe compactly unsteady aerodynamic responses. Such a
   reduced-order model is trained on a series of signals that implicitly
   represent the relationship between the structural motion and the
   aerodynamic loads. The determination of the model parameters is obtained
   through a two-level training procedure where, in the first stage, the
   matrices associated to the linear part of the model are computed by a
   robust subspace projection technique, whereas the remaining nonlinear
   terms are determined by an output error-minimization procedure in the
   second stage. The present approach is tested on two different problems,
   proving the convergence toward the reference results obtained by a
   computational fluid dynamics solver in linear and nonlinear,
   aerodynamic, and aeroelastic applications, whereas the aerodynamic
   reduced-order models are coupled with the related structural mechanical
   systems, demonstrating the ability of capturing the main nonlinear
   features of the response. The robustness of the reduced-order model is
   then tested considering a series of inputs with varying amplitudes and
   frequencies outside the range of interest and computing aeroelastic
   responses with nonnull pretwist angles.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The shape of adherent cells is known to be a key determinant of cellular
   processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.
   Manipulation of cell shape affects stem cell differentiation, gene
   expression, and the response of cells to mechanical stimulation. Shape
   sensing is at least partially due to mechanically-sensitive signaling
   within focal adhesions (FAs). Therefore, we evaluate the dependence of
   cellular force generation on cellular geometry by measuring loads across
   the FA protein vinculin using an engineered Forster Resonance Energy
   Transfer-based biosensor. To control cellular geometry, vinculin
   deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably expressing the vinculin
   sensor were confined to specific shapes of the same area using
   photopatterning techniques. It was observed that the tension across
   vinculin increases at the edges of the cells. However, vinculin
   supporting compressive loads was found in the center of cells, with an
   increase in compression observed with increasing aspect ratio. This
   phenomena is consistent with observations of compressive forces directly
   under the nucleus and supported by our observation of increased nuclear
   deformation and enhanced apical actin organization, though this is the
   first time compressive loads across vinculin have been shown to maintain
   FA assembly. This suggests a new paradigm for mechanosensitivity in
   adhesion mechanobiology, where the compressive and tensile loads across
   particular proteins must be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Boron Carbide exhibits a broad composition range, implying a degree of
   intrinsic substitutional disorder. While the observed phase has
   rhombohedral symmetry (space group R (3) over barm), the enthalpy
   minimizing structure has lower, monoclinic, symmetry (space group Cm).
   The crystallographic primitive cell consists of a 12-atom icosahedron
   placed at the vertex of a rhombohedral lattice, together with a 3-atom
   chain along the 3-fold axis. In the limit of high carbon content,
   approaching 20\% carbon, the icosahedra are usually of type B-11 C-p,
   where the p indicates the carbon resides on a polar site, while the
   chains are of type C-B-C. We establish an atomic interaction model for
   this composition limit, fit to density functional theory total energies,
   that allows us to investigate the substitutional disorder using Monte
   Carlo simulations augmented by multiple histogram analysis. We find that
   the low temperature monoclinic Cm structure disorders through a pair of
   phase transitions, first via a 3-state Potts-like transition to space
   group R3m, then via an Ising-like transition to the experimentally
   observed R (3) over barm symmetry. The R3m and Cm phases are
   electrically polarized, while the high temperature R (3) over barm phase
   is nonpolar. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A blind compressive sensing algorithm is proposed to reconstruct

   wavelength-dependent data are coded and then superposed, mapping the
   three-dimensional hyperspectral datacube to a two-dimensional image. The
   inversion algorithm learns a dictionary in situ from the measurements
   via global-local shrinkage priors. By using RGB images as side
   information of the compressive sensing system, the proposed approach is
   extended to learn a coupled dictionary from the joint dataset of the
   compressed measurements and the corresponding RGB images, to improve
   reconstruction quality. A prototype camera is built using a
   liquid-crystal-on-silicon modulator. Experimental reconstructions of
   hyperspectral datacubes from both simulated and real compressed
   measurements demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed inversion
   algorithm, the feasibility of the camera and the benefit of side

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{18-25}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Whereas water drops on both lotus leafs and rose petals have high
   contact angles, the drops can easily roll off lotus leafs but strongly
   adhere to rose petals. Here, we report a simple and cost-effective
   approach to fabricate highly stretchable large-area surfaces that give
   lotusleaf and rose-petal effects by harnessing origami patterns formed
   in graphene paper (GP) bonded on a pre-strained elastomer substrate. The
   surfaces of the GP origami exhibit high contact angles (>160 degrees)
   yet robust adhesion to water drops. After depositing a gold film of a
   few nanometers on the GP, the origami of GP-Au gives high contact angle
   (>160 degrees) and low roll-off angles (< 5 degrees) of water drops. We
   show that the high surface roughness of the GP origami leads to the high
   contact angle of water drops, and hydrophilic groups and defects on the
   GP surface significantly enhance the adhesive forces of drops on the GP
   origami, leading to the rose-petal effect. The coating of gold film does
   not affect the surface roughness of the origami but significantly
   reduces the adhesive force, transitioning the rose-petal to lotus-leaf
   effects. In addition, the wetting properties of both GP and GP-Au
   origamis can be tuned over a wide range by simply stretching or
   compressing the substrate elastomer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Extracellular Calcium Modulates Chondrogenic and Osteogenic
   Differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells: A Novel Approach

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that elevating extracellular calcium from a
   concentration of 1.8 to 8 mM accelerates and increases human
   adipose-derived stem cell (hASC) osteogenic differentiation and
   cell-mediated calcium accretion, even in the absence of any other
   soluble osteogenic factors in the culture medium. However, the effects
   of elevated calcium on hASC chondrogenic differentiation have not been
   reported. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of varied
   calcium concentrations on chondrogenic differentiation of hASC. We
   hypothesized that exposure to elevated extracellular calcium (8 mM
   concentration) in a chondrogenic differentiation medium (CDM) would
   inhibit chondrogenesis of hASC when compared to basal calcium (1.8 mM
   concentration) controls. We further hypothesized that a full
   osteochondral construct could be engineered by controlling local release
   of calcium to induce site-specific chondrogenesis and osteogenesis using
   only hASC as the cell source. Human ASC was cultured as micromass
   pellets in CDM containing transforming growth factor-beta 1 and bone
   morphogenetic protein 6 for 28 days at extracellular calcium
   concentrations of either 1.8 mM (basal) or 8 mM (elevated). Our findings
   indicated that elevated calcium induced osteogenesis and inhibited
   chondrogenesis in hASC. Based on these findings, stacked polylactic acid
   nanofibrous scaffolds containing either 0\% or 20\% tricalcium phosphate
   (TCP) nanoparticles were electrospun and tested for site-specific
   chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Histological assays confirmed that
   human ASC differentiated locally to generate calcified tissue in layers
   containing 20\% TCP, and cartilage in the layers with no TCP when
   cultured in CDM. This is the first study to report the effects of
   elevated calcium on chondrogenic differentiation of hASC, and to develop
   osteochondral nanofibrous scaffolds using a single cell source and
   controlled calcium release to induce site-specific differentiation. This
   approach holds great promise for osteochondral tissue engineering using
   a single cell source (hASC) and single scaffold.}},

Title = {{Pre-drilling background groundwater quality in the Deep River Triassic
   Basin of central North Carolina, USA}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional natural gas development via horizontal drilling and
   hydraulic fracturing has greatly increased the supply of natural gas in
   the United States. However, the practice presents concerns about the
   possibility for impacts on shallow groundwater aquifers. The Deep River
   Triassic Basin in central North Carolina is likely to contain natural
   gas that could be extracted via hydraulic fracturing in the future.
   Unlike other states where hydraulic fracturing has been employed, North
   Carolina has no history of commercial oil and gas extraction. In this
   study, we measured water chemistry, dissolved gases, and volatile
   organic compounds in 51 private drinking water well samples over the
   Deep River Triassic Basin. Our data document the background water
   quality of shallow aquifers in the Deep River Basin, which could provide
   an important baseline dataset if hydraulic fracturing occurs here in the
   future. We found only two of the 51 water wells sampled had dissolved
   CH4 concentrations >0.1 mg/L, and no well had a methane concentration
   >0.5 mg/L. The delta C-13-CH4 of the two highest CH4 concentration water
   wells (-69.5 parts per thousand and -61 parts per thousand) suggest a
   biogenic CH4 source and are distinct from the delta C-13-CH4 of two test
   gas wells drilled in the area (-54.41 parts per thousand and -45.11
   parts per thousand). Unlike other basins overlying shale gas formations
   in the US, we find no evidence for CH4 migration into shallow
   groundwater in the Triassic basin. In addition, we found only seven VOCs
   in five water samples, with all levels below the US EPA's maximum
   contaminant levels. Ion and trace metal concentrations in most samples
   were also below US EPA primary drinking water standards, with the
   exception of two samples that exceed the standards for As. We modeled
   the depth of the upper surface of the Cumnock Shale formation in the
   Deep River Basin using a kriging algorithm and found that its depth
   below the surface is shallow (0-similar to 1500 m) relative to other
   shale formations that have been drilled commercially in the US,
   including the Marcellus in Pennsylvania and the Fayetteville in
   Arkansas. The relatively shallow shale, combined with the presence of
   multiple faults and diabase intrusions that characterize the geology of
   the area, may make the Deep River Triassic Basin more vulnerable to deep
   fluid connectivity to shallow aquifers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Parsimony, including sparsity and low rank, has been shown to
   successfully model data in numerous machine learning and signal
   processing tasks. Traditionally, such modeling approaches rely on an
   iterative algorithm that minimizes an objective function with
   parsimony-promoting terms. The inherently sequential structure and
   data-dependent complexity and latency of iterative optimization
   constitute a major limitation in many applications requiring real-time
   performance or involving large-scale data. Another limitation
   encountered by these modeling techniques is the difficulty of their
   inclusion in discriminative learning scenarios. In this work, we propose
   to move the emphasis from the model to the pursuit algorithm, and
   develop a process-centric view of parsimonious modeling, in which a
   learned deterministic fixed-complexity pursuit process is used in lieu
   of iterative optimization. We show a principled way to construct
   learnable pursuit process architectures for structured sparse and robust
   low rank models, derived from the iteration of proximal descent
   algorithms. These architectures learn to approximate the exact
   parsimonious representation at a fraction of the complexity of the
   standard optimization methods. We also show that appropriate training
   regimes allow to naturally extend parsimonious models to discriminative
   settings. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on several
   challenging problems in image and audio processing with several orders
   of magnitude speed-up compared to the exact optimization algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{An estimated 12\% of patients seeking surgical intervention for
   symptomatic arthritis have an etiology of post-traumatic arthritis
   (PTA). The onset of PTA is rapid in the setting of articular fracture
   (AF). The investigation began with development of a murine model of a
   closed AF that develops PTA. In the process of characterizing this model
   a technique was developed for assessing quantitative synovial fluid
   biomarker concentrations. The work began with observations of the
   natural history of PTA development in the C57BL/6 strain of mice. A
   species of mice (MRL/MpJ) was found that is protected from PTA after AF.
   Further work identified key differences between mouse strains that did
   and did not develop PTA. This knowledge led to an intervention based on
   anti-cytokine (interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, (IL-1Ra) delivery in
   the C57BL/6 strain of mice that successfully prevented PTA following AF.
   This success in preventing PTA in the murine model has elucidated
   several important clinical implications: 1) Pro-inflammatory cytokines
   play an important role in the development of PTA after joint injury, 2)
   Pharmacologic intervention can lessen the severity of PTA after an AF,
   and 3) The murine AF model of joint injury provides a novel means of
   studying mechanisms of PTA development. (C) 2015 Orthopaedic Research

   90A degrees magnetic sector mass spectrometer with a specifically
   designed coded aperture, deriving the corresponding forward mathematical
   model and spectral reconstruction algorithm, and then utilizing the
   resulting system to measure and reconstruct the mass spectra of argon,

Abstract = {{The morphological and mechanical properties of the pediatric skull are
   important in understanding pediatric head injury biomechanics. Although
   previous studies have analyzed the morphology of cranial sutures, none
   has done so in pediatric specimens nor have previous studies related the
   morphology to mechanical properties of human sutures. This study
   quantified the geometry of pediatric cranial sutures and investigated
   its correlation with the suture mechanical properties. First, the suture
   fiber alignment was quantified using histological analysis for four
   ages-neonate, 9 months-old, 11 months-old, and 18 months-old. For the
   morphometric investigation of the suture interdigitation, suture samples
   from a 6-year-old were scanned using micro-CT and the level of
   interdigitation was measured using two techniques. The first technique,
   the sinuosity index, was calculated by dividing the suture path along
   the surface of the skull by the suture distance from beginning to end.
   The second technique, the surface area interdigitation index, was
   calculated by measuring the surface area of the bone interface outlining
   the suture and dividing it by the cross-sectional area of the bone. The
   mechanical properties were obtained using methods reported in Davis et
   al.6. The results of the histological analysis showed a significant
   increase in fiber alignment in older specimen; where random fiber
   alignment has an average angle deviation of 45A degrees, neonatal suture
   fibers have an average deviation of 32.2A degrees and the 18-month-old
   fibers had an average deviation of 16.2A degrees (p < 0.0001). For the
   suture index measurements, only the sinuosity was positively correlated
   with the ultimate strain (R (2) = 0.62, Bonferroni corrected p = 0.011)
   but no other measurements showed a significant relationship, including
   the amount of interdigitation and elastic modulus. Our results
   demonstrate that there is a distinct developmental progression of the
   suture fiber alignment at a young age, but the differences in suture
   interdigitation can only predict the ultimate strain and no other
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{A new compact stub-loaded composite right/left-handed (SL-CRLH)
   resonator is presented for the first time. The resonance properties of
   the proposed SL-CRLH resonator are deduced by odd- and even-mode
   analysis method. Besides miniaturization and wide upper stopband, the
   bandpass filter (BPF) using SL-CRLH resonator is found to have an
   additional advantage that the bandwidth can be tuned by the stub length.
   Based on the proposed resonator, two BPFs operating at 3.1 GHz with
   source-load magnetic cross coupling are designed, fabricated, and
   tested. The good agreements between simulated and measured results
   validate the design concept. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave

Abstract = {{Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates excitability of
   motor cortex. However, there is conflicting evidence about the efficacy
   of this non-invasive brain stimulation modality to modulate performance
   on cognitive tasks. Previous work has tested the effect of tDCS on
   specific facets of cognition and executive processing. However, no
   randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study has looked at the
   effects of tDCS on a comprehensive battery of cognitive processes. The
   objective of this study was to test if tDCS had an effect on performance
   on a comprehensive assay of cognitive processes, a standardized
   intelligence quotient (IQ) test. The study consisted of two substudies
   and followed a double-blind, between-subjects, sham-controlled design.
   In total, 41 healthy adult participants were included in the final
   analysis. These participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
   Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) as a baseline measure. At least one week
   later, participants in substudy 1 received either bilateral tDCS (anodes
   over both F4 and F3, cathode over Cz, 2 mA at each anode for 20 min) or
   active sham tDCS (2 mA for 40 s), and participants in substudy 2
   received either right or left tDCS (anode over either F4 or F3, cathode
   over Cz, 2 mA for 20 min). In both studies, the WAIS-IV was immediately
   administered following stimulation to assess for performance differences
   induced by bilateral and unilateral tDCS. Compared to sham stimulation,
   right, left, and bilateral tDCS reduced improvement between sessions on
   Full Scale IQ and the Perceptual Reasoning Index. This demonstration
   that frontal tDCS selectively degraded improvement on specific metrics
   of the WAIS-IV raises important questions about the often proposed role
   of tDCS in cognitive enhancement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of nonuniformly
   rotating targets, such as highly maneuvering airplanes and ships
   fluctuating with oceanic waves, azimuth echoes have to be modeled as
   cubic phase signals (CPSs) after the range migration compensation and
   the translational-induced phase error correction. For the CPS model, the
   chirp rate and the quadratic chirp rate, which deteriorate the azimuth
   focusing quality due to the Doppler frequency shift, need to be
   estimated with a parameter estimation algorithm. In this paper, by
   employing the proposed generalized scaled Fourier transform (GSCFT) and
   the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT), a fast parameter
   estimation algorithm is presented and utilized in the ISAR imaging of
   the nonuniformly rotating target. Compared to the scaled Fourier
   transform-based algorithm, advantages of the fast parameter estimation
   algorithm include the following: 1) the computational cost is lower due
   to the utilization of the NUFFT, and 2) the GSCFT has a wider
   applicability in ISAR imaging applications. The CPS model and the
   algorithm implementation are verified with the real radar data of a ship
   target. In addition, the cross-term, which plays an important role in
   correlation algorithms, is analyzed for the fast parameter estimation
   algorithm. Through simulations of the synthetic data and the real radar
   data, we verify the effectiveness of the fast parameter estimation
   algorithm and the corresponding ISAR imaging algorithm.}},

Title = {{Dose and pulse sequence considerations for hyperpolarized Xe-129

Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{877-885}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   hyperpolarized Xe-129 dose on image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
   ventilation defect conspicuity on both multi-slice gradient echo and
   isotropic 3D-radially acquired ventilation MRI.
   Materials and methods: Ten non-smoking older subjects (ages 60.8 +/- 7.9
   years) underwent hyperpolarized (HP) Xe-129 ventilation MRI using both
   GRE and 3D-radial acquisitions, each tested using a 71 ml (high) and 24
   ml (low) dose equivalent (DE) of fully polarized, fully enriched Xe-129.
   For all images SNR and ventilation defect percentage (VDP) were
   calculated.
   Results: Normalized SNR (SNRn), obtained by dividing SNR by voxel volume
   and dose was higher for high-DE GRE acquisitions (SNRn = 1.9 +/- 0.8
   ml(-2)) than low-DE GRE scans (SNRn = 0.8 +/- 0.2 ml(-2)). Radially
   acquired images exhibited a more consistent, albeit lower SNRn (High-DE:
   SNRn = 0.5 +/- 0.1 ml(-2), low-DE: SNRn = 0.5 +/- 02 ml(-2)). VDP was
   indistinguishable across all scans.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that images acquired using the
   high-DE GRE sequence provided the highest SNRn, which was in agreement
   with previous reports in the literature. 3D-radial images had lower SNR,
   but have advantages for visual display, monitoring magnetization
   dynamics, and visualizing physiological gradients. By evaluating
   normalized SNR in the context of dose-equivalent formalism, it should be
   possible to predict Xe-129 dose requirements and quantify the benefits
   of more efficient transmit/receive coils, field strengths, and pulse
   sequences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the release of organic compounds, the variations of
   membrane properties and the formation of toxic byproducts during
   chlorine treatment of polyvinyl pyrrolidone-polysulfone (PVP-PSF)
   membranes were investigated. Chlorine treatment decreased bovine serum
   albumin rejection, permeability and hydrophilicity of PVP-PSF membranes
   and resulted in the release of organic compounds as measured by total
   organic carbon (TOC). More organic compounds were released from the
   membranes at higher chlorine concentrations and higher initial values of
   chlorine contact pH. The presence of bromide that can be oxidized to
   bromine by chlorine also increased the release of organic matter from
   the membranes and contributed to the formation of high toxic brominatecl
   byproducts. Five toxic volatile chlorinated byproducts, chloroform,
   chloral hydrate, 1,1-dichloro-2-propanone, 1,1,1-trichloro-2-propanone
   and trichloronitromethane, were formed during chlorination of the
   organic compounds from the PVP-PSF membranes. Three brominated
   byproducts including bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and
   bromoform were determined in the presence of bromide. The PVP appears to
   be more susceptible than PSF to chlorine destruction in the PVP-PSF

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the adaptive detection of moving targets for
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar in heterogeneous clutter
   environments. Two new detectors based on Rao and Wald criteria are
   developed using an ad hoc design procedure. Precisely, we first obtain
   the Rao and Wald tests by assuming the known target velocity and the
   known structure of the clutter. Then, we modify them by performing a
   numerical optimization with respect to the target velocity and replacing
   the clutter covariance matrix with a proper estimate. With a limited
   number of secondary data set, a class of covariance matrix estimators,
   defined as the geometric barycenters of some basic covariance matrix
   estimates obtained from the available secondary data set, are proposed
   by exploiting the characteristic of the positive-definite matrix space.
   Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed detectors and covariance matrix
   estimators. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated National Lightning Detection Network reports and
   lightning radio waveforms in a 44 day observation period to analyze the
   in-cloud (IC) events producing currents above 200 kA. The results show
   that there are two distinct classes of IC lightning events with very
   high peak currents: the well-known narrow bipolar events, and a
   previously unreported type that we call energetic in-cloud pulses
   (EIPs). Their temporal and spatial context shows that EIPs are generated
   from existing negative polarity leaders that are propagating usually
   upward but sometimes downward. The nearly identical characteristics of
   EIPs and some previously reported terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs)
   indicate a likely connection between the two, which further suggests the
   possibility of downward directed TGFs. These very high peak current IC
   events also suggest the association of EIPs with ionospheric
   perturbations and optical emissions known as elves.}},

Title = {{Thin-Film Preparation and Characterization of Cs3Sb2I9: A Lead-Free
   Layered Perovskite Semiconductor}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Computational, thin-film deposition, and characterization approaches
   have been used to examine the ternary halide semiconductor Cs3Sb2I9.
   Cs3Sb2I9 has two known structural modifications, the 0-D dimer form
   (space group P6(3)/mmc, no. 194) and the 2-D layered form (P (3) over
   bar m1, no. 164), which can be prepared via solution and solid-state or
   gas-phase reactions, respectively. Our computational investigations
   suggest that the layered form, which is a one-third Sb-deficient
   derivative of the ubiquitous perovskite structure, is a potential
   candidate for high-band gap photovoltaic (PV) applications. In this
   work, we describe details of a two-step deposition approach that enables
   the preparation of large grain (>1 mu m) and continuous thin films of
   the lead-free layered perovskite derivative Cs3Sb2I9. Depending on the
   deposition conditions, films that are c-axis oriented or randomly
   oriented can be obtained. The fabricated thin films show enhanced
   stability under ambient air, compared to methylammonium lead(II) iodide
   perovskite films stored under similar conditions, and an optical band
   gap value of 2.05 eV. Photoelectron spectroscopy study yields an
   ionization energy of 5.6 eV, with the valence band maximum approximately
   0.85 eV below the Fermi level, indicating near-intrinsic, weakly p-type
   character. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis points to a nearly
   direct band gap for this material (less than 0.02 eV difference between
   the direct and indirect band gaps) and a similar high-level of
   absorption compared to CH3NH3PbI3. The photoluminescence peak intensity
   of Cs3Sb2I9 is substantially suppressed compared to that of CH3NH3PbI3,
   likely reflecting the presence of deep level defects that result in
   nonradiative recombination in the film, with computational results
   pointing to I-nu I-Sb, and V-I as being likely candidates. A key further
   finding from this study is that, despite a distinctly layered structure,
   the electronic transport anisotropy is less pronounced due to the high
   ionicity of the I atoms and the strong antibonding interactions between
   the Sb s lone pair states and I p states, which leads to a moderately
   dispersive valence band.}},

Abstract = {{The design of biocompatible particles with defined size on the nanometer
   scale has proven to be a challenging task in current biomedical
   research. Here we present an approach toward temperature-responsive
   nanoparticles by covalently cross-linking micelles based on trimeric
   constructs of elastin-like polypeptides. These trimers can be triggered
   to assemble into micelles by heating the solution above a specific
   transition temperature (T-t) which was shown in previous studies. Here
   we show that the disassembly of the micelles below the T-t can be
   prevented by the incorporation of covalent cross-links in the core of
   the micelles. This facilitates a temperature-triggered swelling and
   collapsing by around 35\% in diameter, as determined by dynamic light
   scattering. Size distribution was confirmed by fluorescence correlation
   spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron
   microscopy. We show switchable nanoparticles with reversible volume
   changes in the temperature region between 30 and 40 degrees C, making
   these particles promising candidates for switchable drug delivery
   carriers.}},

   selective perception of a human auditory system has been pursued over

   simultaneous overlapping sounds from different sources. The device with
   a compact array of resonant metamaterials is demonstrated to distinguish
   three overlapping and independent sources with 96.67\% correct audio
   recognition. Segregation of the audio signals is achieved using physical
   layer encoding without relying on source characteristics. This hardware
   approach to multichannel source separation can be applied to robust
   speech recognition and hearing aids and may be extended to other
   acoustic imaging and sensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{A single photon source plays a key role in quantum applications such as
   quantum computers and quantum communications. Epitaxially grown quantum
   dots are one of the promising platforms to implement a good single
   photon source. However, it is challenging to realize an efficient single
   photon source based on semiconductor materials due to their high
   refractive index. Here we demonstrate a direct fiber coupled single
   photon source with high collection efficiency by employing a photonic
   crystal (PhC) waveguide and a tapered micro-fiber. To confirm the single
   photon nature, the second-order correlation function g((2))(tau) is
   measured with a Hanbury Brown-Twiss setup. The measured g((2))(0) value
   is 0.15, and we can estimate 24\% direct collection efficiency from a
   quantum dot to the fiber. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   larger than a single PAMAM. It is, therefore, essential to re-examine
   the dispersion mechanisms of PAMAM toward different types of ligands in
   order to facilitate dendrimer applications in environmental remediation,
   catalysis, and nanomedicine. Here, we applied atomistic discrete
   molecular dynamics simulations to study generation-four (G4) PAMAM
   dendrimers dispersing hexadecane (C16) and phenanthrene (PN), two
   representative linear and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in crude oil. We
   observed a strong cooperativity in the binding of both C16 and PN to
   PAMAM dendrimers, especially with C16. Simulations of multiple PAMAM
   molecules interacting with many hydrocarbons illustrated that
   phenanthrene bound to individual dendrimers to render a unimolecular
   micelle, while multiple C16 molecules formed a large droplet enclosed
   and stabilized by multiple PAMAM dendrimers to assemble into a
   multimolecular micelle. Our analysis revealed that such deviation of the
   PAMAM ligand architecture from the conventional unimolecular micelle
   paradigm arose from strong interligand interactions between linear
   hydrocarbons.}},

Title = {{Micro-anatomical quantitative optical imaging: toward automated
   assessment of breast tissues}},
Journal = {{BREAST CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Pathologists currently diagnose breast lesions through
   histologic assessment, which requires fixation and tissue preparation.
   The diagnostic criteria used to classify breast lesions are qualitative
   and subjective, and inter-observer discordance has been shown to be a
   significant challenge in the diagnosis of selected breast lesions,
   particularly for borderline proliferative lesions. Thus, there is an
   opportunity to develop tools to rapidly visualize and quantitatively
   interpret breast tissue morphology for a variety of clinical
   applications.
   Methods: Toward this end, we acquired images of freshly excised breast
   tissue specimens from a total of 34 patients using confocal fluorescence
   microscopy and proflavine as a topical stain. We developed computerized
   algorithms to segment and quantify nuclear and ductal parameters that
   characterize breast architectural features. A total of 33 parameters
   were evaluated and used as input to develop a decision tree model to
   classify benign and malignant breast tissue. Benign features were
   classified in tissue specimens acquired from 30 patients and malignant
   features were classified in specimens from 22 patients.
   Results: The decision tree model that achieved the highest accuracy for
   distinguishing between benign and malignant breast features used the
   following parameters: standard deviation of inter-nuclear distance and
   number of duct lumens. The model achieved 81 \% sensitivity and 93 \%
   specificity, corresponding to an area under the curve of 0.93 and an
   overall accuracy of 90 \%. The model classified IDC and DCIS with 92 \%
   and 96 \% accuracy, respectively. The cross-validated model achieved 75
   \% sensitivity and 93 \% specificity and an overall accuracy of 88 \%.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that proflavine staining and confocal
   fluorescence microscopy combined with image analysis strategies to
   segment morphological features could potentially be used to
   quantitatively diagnose freshly obtained breast tissue at the point of
   care without the need for tissue preparation.}},

Abstract = {{The use of antibacterial silver nanomaterials in consumer products
   ranging from textiles to toys has given rise to concerns over their
   environmental toxicity. These materials, primarily nanoparticles, have
   been shown to be toxic to a wide range of organisms; thus methods and
   materials that reduce their environmental toxicity while retaining their
   useful antibacterial properties can potentially solve this problem. Here
   we demonstrate that silver nanocubes display a lower toxicity toward the
   model plant species Lolium multiflorum while showing similar toxicity
   toward other environmentally relevant and model organisms (Danio rerio
   and Caenorhabditis elegans) and bacterial species (Esherichia coli,
   Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) compared to quasi-spherical
   silver nanoparticles and silver nanowires. More specifically, in the L.
   multiflorum experiments, the roots of silver nanocube treated plants
   were 5.3\% shorter than the control, while silver nanoparticle treated
   plant roots were 39.6\% shorter than the control. The findings here
   could assist in the future development of new antibacterial products
   that cause less environmental toxicity after their intended use.}},

Title = {{SW1PerS: Sliding windows and 1-persistence scoring; discovering
   periodicity in gene expression time series data}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Identifying periodically expressed genes across different
   processes (e.g. the cell and metabolic cycles, circadian rhythms, etc)
   is a central problem in computational biology. Biological time series
   may contain (multiple) unknown signal shapes of systemic relevance,
   imperfections like noise, damping, and trending, or limited sampling
   density. While there exist methods for detecting periodicity, their
   design biases (e.g. toward a specific signal shape) can limit their
   applicability in one or more of these situations.
   Methods: We present in this paper a novel method, SW1PerS, for
   quantifying periodicity in time series in a shape-agnostic manner and
   with resistance to damping. The measurement is performed directly,
   without presupposing a particular pattern, by evaluating the circularity
   of a high-dimensional representation of the signal. SW1PerS is compared
   to other algorithms using synthetic data and performance is quantified
   under varying noise models, noise levels, sampling densities, and signal
   shapes.
   Results on biological data are also analyzed and compared. Results: On
   the task of periodic/not-periodic classification, using synthetic data,
   SW1PerS outperforms all other algorithms in the low-noise regime.
   SW1PerS is shown to be the most shape-agnostic of the evaluated methods,
   and the only one to consistently classify damped signals as highly
   periodic. On biological data, and for several experiments, the lists of
   top 10\% genes ranked with SW1PerS recover up to 67\% of those generated
   with other popular algorithms. Moreover, the list of genes from data on
   the Yeast metabolic cycle which are highly-ranked only by SW1PerS,
   contains evidently non-cosine patterns (e.g. ECM33, CDC9, SAM1,2 and
   MSH6) with highly periodic expression profiles. In data from the Yeast
   cell cycle SW1PerS identifies genes not preferred by other algorithms,
   hence not previously reported as periodic, but found in other
   experiments such as the universal growth rate response of Slavov. These
   genes are BOP3, CDC10, YIL108W, YER034W, MLP1, PAC2 and RTT101.
   Conclusions: In biological systems with low noise, i.e. where periodic
   signals with interesting shapes are more likely to occur, SW1PerS can be
   used as a powerful tool in exploratory analyses. Indeed, by having an
   initial set of periodic genes with a rich variety of signal types,
   pattern/shape information can be included in the study of systems and
   the generation of hypotheses regarding the structure of gene regulatory
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new Nitsche-type approach for the weak enforcement of

   considered, two penalty parameters are introduced, corresponding to
   Dirichlet and Neumann conditions, respectively. A stability and
   convergence estimate is also provided, in the case of a
   discontinuous-in-time Galerkin space-time integrator. The spatial
   discretization used is based on a stabilized method with equal order
   interpolation for all solution components. In principle, however, the
   proposed methodology is not confined to stabilized methods. We conclude
   with an extensive set of tests to validate the robustness and accuracy
   of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonics-active gold nanoparticles offer excellent potential in
   molecular imaging and cancer therapy. Among them, gold nanostars (AuNS)
   exhibit cross-platform flexibility as multimodal contrast agents for
   macroscopic X-ray computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), as well as nanoprobes for
   photoacoustic tomography (PAT), two-photon photoluminescence (TPL), and
   surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Their surfactant-free
   surface enables versatile functionalization to enhance cancer targeting,
   and allow triggered drug release. AuNS can also be used as an efficient
   platform for drug carrying, photothermal therapy, and photodynamic
   therapy (PDT). This review paper presents the latest progress regarding
   AuNS as a promising nanoplatform for cancer nanotheranostics. Future
   research directions with AuNS for biomedical applications will also be
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Quasi-Static Magnetic Field Shielding Using Longitudinal Mu-Near-Zero
   Metamaterials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{The control of quasi-static magnetic fields is of considerable interest
   in applications including the reduction of electromagnetic interference
   (EMI), wireless power transfer (WPT), and magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI). The shielding of static or quasi-static magnetic fields is
   typically accomplished through the use of inherently magnetic materials
   with large magnetic permeability, such as ferrites, used sometimes in
   combination with metallic sheets and/or active field cancellation.
   Ferrite materials, however, can be expensive, heavy and brittle.
   Inspired by recent demonstrations of epsilon-, mu- and index-near-zero
   metamaterials, here we show how a longitudinal mu-near-zero (LMNZ) layer
   can serve as a strong frequency-selective reflector of magnetic fields
   when operating in the near-field region of dipole-like sources.
   Experimental measurements with a fabricated LMNZ sheet constructed from
   an artificial magnetic conductor - formed from non-magnetic, conducting,
   metamaterial elements - confirm that the artificial structure provides
   significantly improved shielding as compared with a commercially
   available ferrite of the same size. Furthermore, we design a structure
   to shield simultaneously at the fundamental and first harmonic
   frequencies. Such frequency-selective behavior can be potentially useful
   for shielding electromagnetic sources that may also generate higher
   order harmonics, while leaving the transmission of other frequencies
   unaffected.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle drug delivery carriers that can modulate drug release based
   on an exogenous signal, such as light, are of great interest, especially
   for improving cancer therapy. A light-activated delivery vehicle was
   fabricated by synthesizing a thin, thermally responsive
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) hydrogel coating directly onto
   the surfaces of individual near-infrared (NIR) absorbing gold-silica
   nano shells. This hydrogel was designed to be in a swollen state under
   physiological conditions and expel large amounts of water, along with
   any entrapped drug, at elevated temperatures. The required temperature
   change can be achieved via NIR absorption by the nanoshell, allowing the
   hydrogel phase change to be triggered by light, which was observed by
   monitoring changes in particle sizes as water was expelled from the
   hydrogel network. The phase change was reversible and repeatable. As a
   model drug, the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin was loaded into this
   delivery vehicle, and rapid release of doxorubicin occurred upon NIR
   exposure. Further, colon carcinoma cells exposed to the irradiated
   platform displayed nearly 3 times as much doxorubicin uptake as cells
   exposed to nonirradiated particles or free drug, which in turn resulted
   in a higher loss of cell viability. We hypothesize these effects are
   because the NIR-mediated heating results in a transient increase in cell
   membrane permeability, thus aiding in cellular uptake of the drug.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{120}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Diurnal hysteresis between soil temperature (T-s) and both CO2
   concentration ({[}CO2]) and soil respiration rate (R-s) were reported
   across different field experiments. However, the causes of these
   hysteresis patterns remain a subject of debate, with biotic and abiotic
   factors both invoked as explanations. To address these issues, a CO2 gas
   transport model is developed by combining a layer-wise mass conservation
   equation for subsurface gas phase CO2, Fickian diffusion for gas
   transfer, and a CO2 source term that depends on soil temperature,
   moisture, and photosynthetic rate. Using this model, a hierarchy of
   numerical experiments were employed to disentangle the causes of the
   hysteretic {[}CO2]-T-s and CO2 flux T-s (i.e., F-T-s) relations. Model
   results show that gas transport alone can introduce both {[}CO2]-T-s and
   F-T-s hystereses and also confirm prior findings that heat flow in soils
   lead to {[}CO2] and F being out of phase with T-s, thereby providing
   another reason for the occurrence of both hystereses. The area (A(hys))
   of the {[}CO2]-T-s hysteresis near the surface increases, while the
   A(hys) of the R-s-T-s hysteresis decreases as soils become wetter.
   Moreover, a time-lagged carbon input from photosynthesis deformed the
   {[}CO2]-T-s and R-s-T-s patterns, causing a change in the loop direction
   from counterclockwise to clockwise with decreasing time lag. An
   asymmetric 8-shaped pattern emerged as the transition state between the
   two loop directions. Tracing the pattern and direction of the hysteretic
   {[}CO2]-T-s and R-s-T-s relations can provide new ways to fingerprint
   the effects of photosynthesis stimulation on soil microbial activity and
   detect time lags between rhizospheric respiration and photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{We present a dual-modality system for both structural and molecular cell
   imaging based on coregistered quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and
   photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). The QPI system was based on off-axis
   holography, whereas the PAM system comprised a sinusoidally modulated
   optical source for excitation and a narrow-band low profile and low-cost
   ring ultrasonic transducer for detection. This approach facilitated a
   simple confocal alignment of the excitation beams of both modalities and
   the ultrasonic detector. This system was demonstrated by imaging
   endogenous molecules in red blood cells (RBCs) as well as by imaging
   exogenous molecular labels on cancer cells using gold nanoparticles
   (GNPs) functionalized to target epidermal growth factor receptor. QPI
   provided high resolution imaging of the cellular structures while PAM
   provided molecular contrast. This dual-modality microscopy method can
   potentially be implemented as a compact and low cost cellular diagnostic

Abstract = {{For inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of ships fluctuating
   with oceanic waves, azimuth echoes of a range cell have to be modeled as
   cubic phase signals (CPSs) after the range alignment and the phase
   adjustment. In ISAR imaging based on the CPS model, the chirp rate and
   the quadratic chirp rate are identified as causes of the target image
   defocus and need to be estimated with an effective algorithm. In this
   paper, a fast bilinear parameter estimation algorithm is proposed and
   applied in ISAR imaging for fluctuating ships by employing the cubic
   phase bilinear function, the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT),
   and the parameter space switching method. Compared to two existing
   representative parameter estimation algorithms for the CPS, the
   advantages of this proposed estimation algorithm are: 1) the
   computational cost is lower due to the NUFFT and the parameter space
   switching method and 2) the bilinearity and the energy accumulation
   operation guarantee a higher anti-noise performance and a better
   suppression on cross-terms. Through simulations on synthetic models and
   the real radar data, we verify the effectiveness of this fast bilinear
   parameter estimation algorithm and the corresponding ISAR imaging
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the snap-through phenomenon and effect of
   self-contact of the spatial elastica subjected to mid-length torque. One
   end of the elastica is clamped while the other end is placed in a sleeve
   joint. The total arc-length of the elastica can be varied by sliding the
   end through the sleeve joint. At a certain value of total arc-length,
   the sleeve joint is clamped and an external torque is applied at the
   mid-length of the elastica. The system of governing differential
   equations is derived from the equilibrium of an elastica segment and
   geometric relations of the inextensible elastica. The transformation
   matrix formulated in terms of Euler parameters is utilized to avoid the
   kinematic singularity. To display the behavior of the elastica, the
   system of differential equations needs to be integrated numerically from
   one end to the other end. The integration is performed so that the
   boundary conditions and some constraint conditions of the problem are
   satisfied, i.e., a shooting method is used. The effect of self-contact
   is taken into account by considering the contact force as a point load
   applying at contact point. From the results, the snap-through
   phenomenon, effect of self-contact and equilibrium configurations are
   highlighted herein.}},

Abstract = {{Recent measurements of shear wave propagation in viscoelastic materials
   have been analyzed by constructing the two-dimensional Fourier transform
   (2D-FT) of the spatial-temporal shear wave signal and using an analysis
   procedure derived under the assumption the wave is described as a plane
   wave, or as the asymptotic form of a wave expanding radially from a
   cylindrically symmetric source. This study presents an exact, analytic
   expression for the 2D-FT description of shear wave propagation in
   viscoelastic materials following asymmetric Gaussian excitations and
   uses this expression to evaluate the bias in 2D-FT measurements obtained
   using the plane or cylindrical wave assumptions. A wide range of biases
   are observed depending on specific values of frequency, aspect ratio R
   of the source asymmetry, and material properties. These biases can be
   reduced significantly by weighting the shear wave signal in the spatial
   domain to correct for the geometric spreading of the shear wavefront
   using a factor of x(p). The optimal weighting power p is found to be
   near the theoretical value of 0.5 for the case of a cylindrical source
   with R = 1, and decreases for asymmetric sources with R > 1. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Packaging clinically relevant hydrophobic drugs into a self-assembled

   conjugated paclitaxel (PTX) to recombinant chimeric polypeptides (CPs)
   that spontaneously self-assemble into similar to 60 nm near-monodisperse
   nanoparticles that increased the systemic exposure of PTX by sevenfold
   compared with free drug and twofold compared with the Food and Drug
   Administration-approved taxane nanoformulation (Abraxane). The tumour
   uptake of the CP-PTX nanoparticle was fivefold greater than free drug
   and twofold greater than Abraxane. In a murine cancer model of human
   triple-negative breast cancer and prostate cancer, CP-PTX induced
   near-complete tumour regression after a single dose in both tumour
   models, whereas at the same dose, no mice treated with Abraxane survived
   for >80 days (breast) and 60 days (prostate), respectively. These
   results show that a molecularly engineered nanoparticle with precisely
   engineered design features outperforms Abraxane, the current gold

Abstract = {{In order to explore methods of removing CO2 from submersible habitats
   with sea water, gas scrubbing experiments (using tap water, and tap
   water with 3.5 wt\% sea salt) were performed in a 108 mm i.d.
   pilot-scale column, investigating the removal efficiency of CO2 (e.g. at
   2 vol\%) from a gaseous stream. The performance of this column fitted
   with 5 spray nozzles was compared with a column packed with 1/8th in.
   Dixon rings (packing depth = 1480 mm). More detailed experiments were
   then performed in the column packed with Dixon rings at: liquid flows
   from 4 to 8 dm(3) min(-1); gas flows 18 and 36 N dm(3) min(-1), column
   pressures =1 and 4bar(g); column temperatures approximately 5 and 17
   degrees C. In general, CO2 removal increased as column operating
   pressure was increased, or fluid temperature was decreased. When
   approaching low gas outlet CO2 levels at the top of the column (e.g. 0.1
   vol\%), the concentration of carbonate species in the tap water (fed
   into the column) restricted further improvements in the performance of
   the column.
   In experiments in a short column with Dixon rings (packing depth =180
   mm), using fresh water in each column, the performance of a multi-column
   eight chamber compact scrubber was simulated, and shown to be
   significantly better than a single tall column. (C) 2015 The Institution

Abstract = {{Addition of nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI) to anaerobic batch
   reactors to enhance methanogenic activity is described. Two NZVI systems
   were tested: a commercially available NZVI (cNZVI) slurry and a freshly
   synthesized NZVI (sNZVI) suspension that was prepared immediately before
   addition to the reactors. In both systems, the addition of NZVI
   increased pH and decreased oxidation/reduction potential compared with
   unamended control reactors. Biodegradation of a model brewery wastewater
   was enhanced as indicated by an increase in chemical oxygen demand
   removal with both sNZVI and cNZVI amendments at all concentrations
   tested (1.25-5.0 g Fe/L). Methane production increased for all
   NZVI-amended bioreactors, with a maximum increase of 28\% achieved on
   the addition of 2.5 and 5.0 g/L cNZVI. Addition of bulk zero-valent iron
   resulted in only a 5\% increase in methane, indicating the advantage of
   using the nanoscale particles. NZVI amendments further improved produced
   biogas by decreasing the amount of CO2 released from the bioreactor by
   approximately 58\%. Overall, addition of cNZVI proved more beneficial
   than the sNZVI at equal iron concentrations, due to decreased colloidal
   stability and larger effective particle size of sNZVI. Although some
   have reported cytotoxicity of NZVI to anaerobic microorganisms, work
   presented here suggests that NZVI of a certain particle size and
   reactivity can serve as an amendment to anaerobic digesters to enhance
   degradation and increase the value of the produced biogas, yielding a
   more energy-efficient anaerobic method for wastewater treatment.}},

   previously been shown to be a fast and robust semianalytical solver to
   investigate the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in such a
   complex but isotropic or transversely isotropic medium. In this paper,
   several important improvements have been made to extend applications of
   this efficient solver to the anisotropic OCPL medium. The formulas for
   anisotropic media with three different diagonal elements in the
   cylindrical coordinate system are deduced to expand its application. The
   perfectly matched layer (PML) is incorporated along the radial direction
   as an absorbing boundary condition (ABC) to make the NMM method more
   accurate and efficient for unbounded low conductivity media and
   applicable to lossless media. We manipulate the weak form of Maxwell's
   equations and impose the correct boundary conditions at the cylindrical
   axis to solve the singularity problem. Finally, we also offer formulas
   for computing EM fields excited by a magnetic dipole located at any
   position with an arbitrary orientation. Numerical results have
   demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of this method.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed intensified cameras are commonly used to observe and study
   the transient luminous events known as sprite halos and sprite streamers
   occurring in the Earth's upper atmosphere in association with
   thunderstorm activity. In such observations, the phosphor persistence in
   the image intensifier, depending on its characteristic decay time, might
   lead to a significant distortion of the optical signals recorded by
   those cameras. In this paper, we analyze the observational data obtained
   using different camera systems to discuss the effects of phosphor
   persistence on high-speed video observations of sprites, and introduce a
   deconvolution technique to effectively reduce such effects. The
   discussed technique could also be used to enhance the high-speed images
   of other transient optical phenomena in the case when the phosphor
   persistence has a characteristic decay time that is comparable with the
   temporal resolution of the cameras required to resolve the phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Shear wave imaging techniques build maps of local elasticity estimating
   the local group velocity of induced mechanical waves. Velocity estimates
   are formed using the time delay in the motion profile of the medium at
   two or more points offset from the shear wave source. Because the
   absolute time-of-flight between any pair of locations scales with the
   distance between them, there is an inherent trade-off between robustness
   to time-of-flight errors and lateral spatial resolution based on the
   number and spacing of the receive points used for each estimate. This
   work proposes a method of using the time delays measured between all
   combinations of locations to estimate a noise-robust, high-resolution
   image. The time-of-flight problem is presented as an overdetermined
   system of linear equations that can be directly solved with and without
   spatial regularization terms. Finite element method simulations of
   acoustic radiation force-induced shear waves are used to illustrate the
   method, demonstrating superior contrast-to-noise ratio and lateral edge
   resolution characteristics compared with linear regression of arrival
   times. This technique may improve shear wave imaging in situations where
   time-of-flight noise is a limiting factor.}},

Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{101-109}},

Abstract = {{Emerging mobile fugitive emissions detection and measurement approaches
   require robust inverse source algorithms to be effective. Two Gaussian
   plume inverse approaches are described for estimating emission rates
   from ground-level point sources observed from remote vantage points. The
   techniques were tested using data from 41 controlled methane release
   experiments (14 studies) and further investigated using 7 field studies
   executed downwind of oil and gas well pads in Wyoming. Analyzed
   measurements were acquired from stationary observation locations 18-106
   m downwind of the emission sources. From the fluctuating wind direction,
   the lateral plume geometry is reconstructed using a derived relationship
   between the wind direction and crosswind plume position. The crosswind
   plume spread is determined with both modeled and reconstructed Gaussian
   plume approaches and estimates of source emission rates are found
   through inversion. The source emission rates were compared to a simple
   point source Gaussian emission estimation approach that is part of Draft
   EPA Method OTM 33A. Compared to the known release rates, the modeled,
   reconstructed, and point source Gaussian controlled release results
   yield average percent errors of 5\%, -2\%, and 6\% with standard
   deviations of 29\%, 25\%, and 37\%, respectively. Compared to each
   other, the three methods agree within 30\% for 78\% of all 48
   observations (41 CR and 7 Wyoming). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biosand filters in the Artibonite Valley of Haiti, the epicenter of the
   cholera epidemic that began in October 2010, were tested for total
   coliform and Vibrio cholerae removal efficiencies. While coliform are
   often used as an indicator organism for pathogenic bacteria, a
   correlation has never been established linking the concentration of
   coliform and V. cholerae, the causative agent for cholera. Hence, a
   method for field enumeration of V. cholerae was developed and tested. To
   this end, a plate count test utilizing membrane filtration technique was
   developed to measure viable V. cholerae cell concentration in the field.
   Method accuracy was confirmed by comparing plate count concentrations to
   microscopic counts. Additionally, biosand filters were sampled and
   removal efficiencies of V. cholerae and coliform bacteria compared. The
   correlation between removal efficiency and time in operation, biofilm
   ({''}schmutzdecke{''}) composition, and idle time was also investigated.
   The plate count method for V. cholerae was found to accurately reflect
   microscope counts and was shown to be effective in the field. Overall,
   coliform concentration was not an appropriate indicator of V. cholerae
   concentration. In 90 \% of the influent samples from the study, coliform
   underestimated V. cholerae concentration (n = 26). Furthermore, coliform
   removal efficiency was higher than for V. cholerae hence providing a
   conservative measurement. Finally, time in operation and idle time were
   found to be important parameters controlling performance. Overall, this
   method shows promise for field applications and should be expanded to
   additional studies to confirm its efficacy to test for V. cholerae in
   various source waters.}},

Abstract = {{Genome engineering technologies based on the CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE
   systems are enabling new approaches in science and biotechnology.
   However, the specificity of these tools in complex genomes and the role
   of chromatin structure in determining DNA binding are not well

   transcriptional activators in human cells using ChIP-seq to assess
   DNA-binding specificity and RNA-seq to measure the specificity of
   perturbing the transcriptome. Additionally, DNase-seq was used to assess
   genome-wide chromatin remodeling that occurs as a result of their
   action. Our results show that these transcription factors are highly
   specific in both DNA binding and gene regulation and are able to open
   targeted regions of closed chromatin independent of gene activation.
   Collectively, these results underscore the potential for these
   technologies to make precise changes to gene expression for gene and
   cell therapies or fundamental studies of gene function.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Prior work by the authors and other groups has studied the
   creation of automated intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans of
   equivalent quality to those in a patient database of manually created
   clinical plans; those database plans provided guidance on the achievable
   sparing to organs-at-risk (OARs). However, in certain sites, such as
   head-and-neck, the clinical plans may not be sufficiently optimized
   because of anatomical complexity and clinical time constraints. This
   could lead to automated plans that suboptimally exploit OAR sparing.
   This work investigates a novel dose warping and scaling scheme that
   attempts to reduce effects of suboptimal sparing in clinical database
   plans, thus improving the quality of semiautomated head-and-neck cancer
   (HNC) plans.
   Methods: Knowledge-based radiotherapy (KBRT) plans for each of ten
   ``query{''} patients were semiautomatically generated by identifying the
   most similar ``match{''} patient in a database of 103 clinical manually
   created patient plans. The match patient's plans were adapted to the
   query case by: (1) deforming the match beam fluences to suit the query
   target volume and (2) warping the match primary/boost dose distribution
   to suit the query geometry and using the warped distribution to generate
   query primary/boost optimization dose-volume constraints. Item (2)
   included a distance scaling factor to improve query OAR dose sparing
   with respect to the possibly suboptimal clinical match plan. To further
   compensate for a component plan of the match case (primary/boost) not
   optimally sparing OARs, the query dose volume constraints were reduced
   using a dose scaling factor to be the minimum from either (a) the warped
   component plan (primary or boost) dose distribution or (b) the warped
   total plan dose distribution (primary + boost) scaled in proportion to
   the ratio of component prescription dose to total prescription dose. The
   dose-volume constraints were used to plan the query case with no human
   intervention to adjust constraints during plan optimization.
   Results: KBRT and original clinical plans were dosimetrically equivalent
   for parotid glands (mean/median doses), spinal cord, and brainstem
   (maximum doses). KBRT plans significantly reduced larynx median doses
   (21.5 +/- 6.6 Gy to 17.9 +/- 3.9 Gy), and oral cavity mean (32.3 +/- 6.2
   Gy to 28.9 +/- 5.4 Gy) and median (28.7 +/- 5.7 Gy to 23.2 +/- 5.3 Gy)
   doses. Doses to ipsilateral parotid gland, larynx, oral cavity, and
   brainstem were lower or equivalent in the KBRT plans for the majority of
   cases. By contrast, KBRT plans generated without the dose warping and
   dose scaling steps were not significantly different from the clinical
   plans.
   Conclusions: Fast, semiautomatically generated HNC IMRT plans adapted
   from existing plans in a clinical database can be of equivalent or
   better quality than manually created plans. The reductions in OAR doses
   in the semiautomated plans, compared to the clinical plans, indicate
   that the proposed dose warping and scaling method shows promise in
   mitigating the impact of suboptimal clinical plans. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Purpose: A novel breast CT system capable of arbitrary 3D trajectories
   has been developed to address cone beam sampling insufficiency as well
   as to image further into the patient's chest wall. The purpose of this
   study was to characterize any trajectory-related differences in 3D x-ray
   dose distribution in a pendant target when imaged with different orbits.
   Methods: Two acquisition trajectories were evaluated: circular azimuthal
   (no-tilt) and sinusoidal (saddle) orbit with +/- 15 degrees tilts around
   a pendant breast, using Monte Carlo simulations as well as physical
   measurements. Simulations were performed with tungsten (W) filtration of
   a W-anode source; the simulated source flux was normalized to the
   measured exposure of a W-anode source. A water-filled cylindrical
   phantom was divided into 1 cm(3) voxels, and the cumulative energy
   deposited was tracked in each voxel. Energy deposited per voxel was
   converted to dose, yielding the 3D distributed dose volumes.
   Additionally, three cylindrical phantoms of different diameters (10,
   12.5, and 15 cm) and an anthropomorphic breast phantom, initially filled
   with water (mimicking pure fibroglandular tissue) and then with a 75\%
   methanol-25\% water mixture (mimicking 50-50 fibroglandular-adipose
   tissues), were used to simulate the pendant breast geometry and scanned
   on the physical system. Ionization chamber calibrated radiochromic film
   was used to determine the dose delivered in a 2D plane through the
   center of the volume for a fully 3D CT scan using the different orbits.
   Results: Measured experimental results for the same exposure indicated
   that the mean dose measured throughout the central slice for different
   diameters ranged from 3.93 to 5.28 mGy, with the lowest average dose
   measured on the largest cylinder with water mimicking a homogeneously
   fibroglandular breast. These results align well with the cylinder
   phantom Monte Carlo studies which also showed a marginal difference in
   dose delivered by a saddle trajectory in the central slice. Regardless
   of phantom material or filled fluid density, dose delivered by the
   saddle scan was negligibly different than the simple circular, no-tilt
   scans. The average dose measured in the breast phantom was marginally
   higher for saddle than the circular no tilt scan at 3.82 and 3.87 mGy,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: Not only does nontraditional 3D-trajectory CT scanning
   yield more complete sampling of the breast volume but also has
   comparable dose deposition throughout the breast and anterior chest
   volume, as verified by Monte Carlo simulation and physical measurements.

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this work was to assess the inherent image
   quality characteristics of a new multidetector computed tomography
   system in terms of noise, resolution, and detectability index as a
   function of image acquisition and reconstruction for a range of
   clinically relevant settings.
   Methods: A multisized image quality phantom (37, 30, 23, 18.5, and 12 cm
   physical diameter) was imaged on a SOMATOM Force scanner (Siemens
   Medical Solutions) under variable dose, kVp, and tube current modulation
   settings. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP)
   and with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) with
   iterative strengths of 3, 4, and 5. Image quality was assessed in terms
   of the noise power spectrum (NPS), task transfer function (TTF), and
   detectability index for a range of detection tasks (contrasts of
   approximately 45, 90, 300, -900, and 1000 HU, and 2-20 mm diameter)
   based on a non-prewhitening matched filter model observer with eye
   filter.
   Results: Image noise magnitude decreased with decreasing phantom size,
   increasing dose, and increasing ADMIRE strength, offering up to 64\%
   noise reduction relative to FBP. Noise texture in terms of the NPS was
   similar between FBP and ADMIRE (<5\% shift in peak frequency). The
   resolution, based on the TTF, improved with increased ADMIRE strength by
   an average of 15\% in the TTF 50\% frequency for ADMIRE-5. The
   detectability index increased with increasing dose and ADMIRE strength
   by an average of 55\%, 90\%, and 163\% for ADMIRE 3, 4, and 5,
   respectively. Assessing the impact of mA modulation for a fixed average
   dose over the length of the phantom, detectability was up to 49\% lower
   in smaller phantom sections and up to 26\% higher in larger phantom
   sections for the modulated scan compared to a fixed tube current scan.
   Overall, the detectability exhibited less variability with phantom size
   for modulated scans compared to fixed tube current scans.
   Conclusions: Image quality increased with increasing dose and decreasing
   phantom size. The CT system exhibited nonlinear noise and resolution
   properties, especially at very low-doses, large phantom sizes, and for
   low-contrast objects. Objective image quality metrics generally
   increased with increasing dose and ADMIRE strength, and with decreasing
   phantom size. The ADMIRE algorithm could offer comparable image quality
   at reduced doses or improved image quality at the same dose. The use of
   tube current modulation resulted in more consistent image quality with
   changing phantom size. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Volume = {{205}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for benign
   central zone (CZ) of the prostate were compared with ADC values of
   benign peripheral zone (PZ), benign transition zone (TZ), and prostate
   cancer, using histopathologic findings from radical prostatectomy as the
   reference standard.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study included 27 patients with prostate
   cancer (mean {[}+/- SD] age, 60.0 +/- 7.6 years) who had 3-T endorectal
   coil MRI of the prostate performed before undergoing prostatectomy with
   whole-mount histopathologic assessment. Mean ADC values were recorded
   from the ROI within the index tumor and within benign CZ, PZ, and TZ,
   with the use of histopathologic findings as the reference standard. ADC
   values of the groups were compared using paired t tests and ROC curve
   analysis.
   RESULTS. The ADC of benign CZ in the right (1138 +/- 123 x 10(-6)
   mm(2)/s) and left (1166 +/- 141 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) lobes was not
   significantly different (p = 0.217). However, the ADC of benign CZ (1154
   +/- 129 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than the
   ADCs of benign PZ (1579 +/- 197 x 10-6 mm(2)/s) and benign TZ (1429 +/-
   180 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s). Although the ADC of index tumors (1042 +/- 134 x
   10(-6) mm(2)/s) was significantly lower (p = 0.002) than the ADC of
   benign CZ there was no significant difference (p = 0.225) between benign
   CZ and tumors with a Gleason score of 6 (1119 +/- 87 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s).
   In 22.2\% of patients (6/27), including five patients who had tumors
   with a Gleason score greater than 6, the ADC was lower in benign CZ than
   in the index tumor. The AUC of ADC for the differentiation of benign CZ
   from index tumors was 72.4\% (sensitivity, 70.4\%; specificity, 51.9\%),
   and the AUC of ADC for differentiation from tumors with a Gleason score
   greater than 6 was 76.7\% (sensitivity, 75.0\%; specificity, 65.0\%).
   CONCLUSION. The ADC of benign CZ is lower than the ADC of other zones of
   the prostate and overlaps with the ADC of prostate cancer tissue,
   including high-grade tumors. Awareness of this potential diagnostic
   pitfall is important to avoid misinterpreting the normal CZ as
   suspicious for tumor.}},

Abstract = {{The pudendal nerve carries sensory information from the urethra that
   controls spinal reflexes necessary to maintain continence and achieve
   efficient micturition. Despite the key role urethral sensory feedback
   plays in regulation of the lower urinary tract, there is little
   information about the characteristics of urethral sensory responses to
   physiological stimuli, and the quantitative relationship between
   physiological stimuli and the evoked sensory activation is unknown. Such
   a relation is critical to understanding the neural control of the lower
   urinary tract and how dysfunction arises in disease states. We
   systematically quantified pudendal afferent responses to fluid flow in
   the urethra in vivo in the rat. We characterized the sensory response
   across a range of stimuli, and describe a previously unreported
   long-term neural accommodation phenomenon. We developed and validated a
   compact mechanistic mathematical model capable of reproducing the
   pudendal sensory activity in response to arbitrary profiles of urethral
   flows. These results describe the properties and function of urethral
   afferents that are necessary to understand how sensory disruption
   manifests in lower urinary tract pathophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers fundamental limits for solving sparse inverse
   problems in the presence of Poisson noise with physical constraints.
   Such problems arise in a variety of applications, including
   photon-limited imaging systems based on compressed sensing (CS). Most
   prior theoretical results in CS and related inverse problems apply to
   idealized settings where the noise is independent identically
   distributed and do not account for signal-dependent noise and physical
   sensing constraints. Prior results on Poisson CS with signal-dependent
   noise and physical constraints provided upper bounds on mean-squared
   error (MSE) performance for a specific class of estimators. However, it
   was unknown whether those bounds were tight or if other estimators could
   achieve significantly better performance. This paper provides minimax
   lower bounds on MSE for sparse Poisson inverse problems under physical
   constraints. The lower bounds are complemented by minimax upper bounds
   which match the lower bounds for certain problem sizes and noise levels.
   The source of the mismatch between upper and lower bounds for other
   problem sizes and noise levels is discussed. The upper and lower bounds
   reveal that due to the interplay between the Poisson noise model, the
   sparsity constraint and the physical constraints: 1) the MSE upper bound
   does not depend on the sample size n other than to ensure the sensing
   matrix satisfies Restricted Isometry Property-like conditions and the
   intensity T of the input signal plays a critical role and 2) the MSE
   upper bound has two distinct regimes, corresponding to low and high
   intensities, and the transition point from the low-intensity to
   high-intensity regime depends on the sparsifying basis D. In the
   low-intensity regime, the MSE upper bound is independent of T while in
   the high-intensity regime, the MSE upper bound scales as (s log p/T),
   where s is the sparsity level, p is the number of pixels or parameters,
   and T is the signal intensity.}},

Title = {{Design and in vivo evaluation of more efficient and selective deep brain
   stimulation electrodes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for
   movement disorders and a promising therapy for treating epilepsy and
   psychiatric disorders. Despite its clinical success, the efficiency and
   selectivity of DBS can be improved. Our objective was to design
   electrode geometries that increased the efficiency and selectivity of
   DBS. Approach. We coupled computational models of electrodes in brain
   tissue with cable models of axons of passage (AOPs), terminating axons
   (TAs), and local neurons (LNs); we used engineering optimization to
   design electrodes for stimulating these neural elements; and the model
   predictions were tested in vivo. Main results. Compared with the
   standard electrode used in the Medtronic Model 3387 and 3389 arrays,
   model-optimized electrodes consumed 45-84\% less power. Similar gains in
   selectivity were evident with the optimized electrodes: 50\% of parallel
   AOPs could be activated while reducing activation of perpendicular AOPs
   from 44 to 48\% with the standard electrode to 0-14\% with bipolar
   designs; 50\% of perpendicular AOPs could be activated while reducing
   activation of parallel AOPs from 53 to 55\% with the standard electrode
   to 1-5\% with an array of cathodes; and, 50\% of TAs could be activated
   while reducing activation of AOPs from 43 to 100\% with the standard
   electrode to 2-15\% with a distal anode. In vivo, both the geometry and
   polarity of the electrode had a profound impact on the efficiency and
   selectivity of stimulation. Significance. Model-based design is a
   powerful tool that can be used to improve the efficiency and selectivity
   of DBS electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Tree-like structures are fundamental in nature, and it is often useful
   to reconstruct the topology of a tree-what connects to what-from a
   two-dimensional image of it. However, the projected branches often cross
   in the image: the tree projects to a planar graph, and the inverse
   problem of reconstructing the topology of the tree from that of the
   graph is ill-posed. We regularize this problem with a generative,
   parametric tree-growth model. Under this model, reconstruction is
   possible in linear time if one knows the direction of each edge in the
   graph-which edge endpoint is closer to the root of the tree-but becomes
   NP-hard if the directions are not known. For the latter case, we present
   a heuristic search algorithm to estimate the most likely topology of a
   rooted, three-dimensional tree from a single two-dimensional image.
   Experimental results on retinal vessel, plant root, and synthetic tree
   data sets show that our methodology is both accurate and efficient.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) at conventional current amplitudes
   (800-900 mA) is highly effective but carries the risk of cognitive side
   effects. Lowering and individualizing the current amplitude may reduce
   side effects by virtue of a less intense and more focal electric field
   exposure in the brain, but this aspect of ECT dosing is largely
   unexplored. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) induces a weaker and more
   focal electric field than ECT; however, the pulse amplitude is not
   individualized and the minimum amplitude required to induce a seizure is
   unknown. We titrated the amplitude of long stimulus trains (500 pulses)
   as a means of determining the minimum current amplitude required to
   induce a seizure with ECT (bilateral, right unilateral, bifrontal, and
   frontomedial electrode placements) and MST (round coil on vertex) in
   nonhuman primates. Furthermore, we investigated a novel method of
   predicting this amplitude-titrated seizure threshold (ST) by a
   non-convulsive measurement of motor threshold (MT) using single pulses
   delivered through the ECT electrodes or MST coil. Average STs were
   substantially lower than conventional pulse amplitudes (112-174 mA for
   ECT and 37.4\% of maximum device amplitude for MST). ST was more
   variable in ECT than in MST. MT explained 63\% of the ST variance and is
   hence the strongest known predictor of ST. These results indicate that
   seizures can be induced with less intense electric fields than
   conventional ECT that may be safer; efficacy and side effects should be
   evaluated in clinical studies. MT measurement could be a faster and
   safer alternative to empirical ST titration for ECT and MST.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{239-245}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Culturing and measuring bacterial population dynamics are critical to
   develop insights into gene regulation or bacterial physiology.
   Traditional methods, based on bulk culture to obtain such
   quantification, have the limitations of higher cost/volume of reagents,
   non-amendable to small size of population and more laborious
   manipulation. To this end, droplet-based microfluidics represents a
   promising alternative that is cost-effective and high-throughput.
   However, difficulties in manipulating the droplet environment and
   monitoring encapsulated bacterial population for long-term experiments
   limit its utilization. To overcome these limitations, we used an
   electrode-free injection technology to modulate the chemical environment
   in droplets. This ability is critical for precise control of bacterial
   dynamics in droplets. Moreover, we developed a trapping device for
   long-term monitoring of population dynamics in individual droplets for
   at least 240 h. We demonstrated the utility of this new microfluidic
   system by quantifying population dynamics of natural and engineered
   bacteria. Our approach can further improve the analysis for systems and
   synthetic biology in terms of manipulability and high temporal
   resolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper performs a theoretical and experimental investigation of the
   natural frequency and stability of rocking semicircular, parabolic, and
   semi-elliptical disks. Horace Lamb's method for deriving the natural
   frequency of an arbitrary rocking disk is applied to three shapes with
   semicircular, parabolic, and semi-elliptical cross sections,
   respectively. For the case of the semicircular disk, the system's
   equation of motion is derived to verify Lamb's method. Additionally, the
   rocking semicircular disk is found to always have one stable equilibrium
   position. For the cases of the parabolic and semi-elliptical disks, this

Abstract = {{Invasive Lactobacillus bacteria inhibit ethanol fermentations and reduce
   final product yields. Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant
   strains of Lactobacillus spp., alternative disinfection strategies are
   needed for ethanol fermentations. The feasibility of using the
   bacteriophage (phage) 8014-B2 to control Lactobacillus plantarum in
   ethanol fermentations by Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated. In
   48h media-based shake flask fermentations, phages achieved greater than
   3-log inactivation of L. plantarum, protected final ethanol yields, and
   maintained yeast viability. The phage-based bacterial disinfection rates
   depended on both the initial phage and bacterial concentrations.
   Furthermore, a simple set of kinetic equations was used to model the
   yeast, bacteria, phage, reducing sugars, and ethanol concentrations over
   the course of 48h, and the various kinetic parameters were determined.
   Taken together, these results demonstrate the applicability of phages to
   reduce L. plantarum contamination and to protect final product yields in
   media-based fermentations. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112: 1544-1553. (c)

Abstract = {{Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) are a key pathway by which
   nanoparticles (NPs) enter the environment following release from
   NP-enabled products. This work considers the fate and exposure of CeO2
   NPs in WWTPs in a two-step process of heteroaggregation with bacteria
   followed by the subsequent reduction of Ce(IV) to Ce(III). Measurements
   of NP association with solids in sludge were combined with experimental
   estimates of reduction rate constants for CeO2 NPs in Monte Carlo
   simulations to predict the concentrations and speciation of Ce in WWTP
   effluents and biosolids. Experiments indicated preferential accumulation
   of CeO2 NPs in biosolids where reductive transformation would occur.
   Surface functionalization was observed to impact both the distribution
   coefficient and the rates of transformation. The relative affinity of
   CeO2 NPs for bacterial suspensions in sludge appears to explain
   differences in the observed rates of Ce reduction for the two types of
   CeO2 NPs studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The resonance associated with plasmonic nanostructures strongly enhances
   local optical fields, and can thus dramatically enhance the nonlinear
   response of the composite structure. However, the origin of the
   nonlinear signal generated from hybrid nanostructures consisting of both
   metallic and dielectric components can be ambiguous when all
   constituents possess nonlinearities. In this paper, we introduce a
   method for specifically identifying the third harmonic generation (THG)
   originating from different nonlinear sources in a film-coupled
   nanostripe. The nanostripe consists of a metallic patch separated from a
   metallic film by a dielectric spacer. By considering the THG from each
   nonlinear source separately, we show that the near-and far-field
   behaviors of the THG generated within the various constituents of the
   nanostripe are distinguishable due to fundamental differences in the THG
   radiation properties. The THG signal from the metal is shown to be
   suppressed by the structure itself, while the THG signal from the spacer
   is enhanced by the gap plasmon modes supported by the structure. The
   total THG signal is found to be the sum of all nonlinear sources, with
   the far-field radiation pattern determined by the ratio between the
   third-order susceptibilities of the dielectric and the metal. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Volumes of natural gas extraction-derived wastewaters have increased
   sharply over the past decade, but the ultimate fate of those waste
   streams is poorly characterized. Here, we sought to (a) quantify natural
   gas residual fluid sources and endpoints to bound the scope of potential
   waste stream impacts and (b) describe the organic pollutants discharged
   to surface waters following treatment, a route of likely ecological
   exposure. Our findings indicate that centralized waste treatment
   facilities (CWTF) received 9.5\% (8.5 X 10(8) L) of natural gas residual
   fluids in 2013, with some facilities discharging all effluent to surface
   waters. In dry months, discharged water volumes were on the order of the
   receiving body flows for some plants, indicating that surface waters can
   become waste-dominated in summer. As disclosed organic compounds used in
   high volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) vary greatly in physicochemical
   properties, we deployed a suite of analytical techniques to characterize
   CWTF effluents, covering 90.5\% of disclosed compounds. Results revealed
   that, of nearly 1000 disclosed organic compounds used in HVHF, only
   petroleum distillates and alcohol polyethoxylates were present. Few
   analytes targeted by regulatory agencies (e.g., benzene or toluene) were
   observed, highlighting the need for expanded and improved monitoring
   efforts at CWTFs.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial crops are directly exposed to silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs)
   and their environmentally transformed analog silver sulfide
   nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs) when wastewater treatment biosolids are applied
   as fertilizer to agricultural soils. This leads to a need to understand
   their bioavailability to plants. In the present study, the mechanisms of
   uptake and distribution of silver in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) were
   quantified and visualized upon hydroponic exposure to Ag-NPs, Ag2S-NPs,
   and AgNO3 at 3 mg total Ag/L. Total silver uptake was measured in dried
   roots and shoots, and the spatial distribution of elements was
   investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
   synchrotron-based X-ray imaging techniques. Despite large differences in
   release of Ag+ ions from the particles, Ag-NPs, Ag2S-NPs, and Ag+ became
   associated with plant roots to a similar degree, and exhibited similarly
   limited (<1\%) amounts of translocation of silver into the shoot system.
   X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping revealed differences in the
   distribution of Ag into roots for each treatment. Silver nanoparticles
   mainly accumulated in the (columella) border cells and elongation zone,
   whereas Ag+ accumulated more uniformly throughout the root. In contrast,
   Ag2S-NPs remained largely adhered to the root exterior, and the presence
   of cytoplasmic nano-SixOy aggregates was observed. Exclusively in roots
   exposed to particulate silver, NPs smaller than the originally dosed NPs
   were identified by TEM in the cell walls. The apparent accumulation of
   Ag in the root apoplast determined by XRF, and the presence of small NPs
   in root cell walls suggests uptake of partially dissolved NPs and
   translocation along the apoplast.}},

   optimization algorithm based on a gradient descent minimization
   strategy. Results from infrared image sequences corrupted with simulated
   and real fixed-pattern noise show a competitive performance compared
   with state-of-the-art methods. A qualitative analysis on the

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{The strain dynamic of thin film AlN is investigated before and after the
   deposition of a GaN epitaxial layer using plasma assisted molecular beam
   epitaxy. X-ray diffraction omega/2 theta-scan and asymmetric reciprocal
   space mapping analysis show that the deposition of GaN alters the strain
   state of the underlying AlN template. The in-plane lattice constant of
   the AlN is found to increase upon growth of GaN, giving rise to a more
   relaxed GaN epitaxial layer. Hence, the subsequent GaN epitaxial thin
   film possesses better structural quality especially with lower screw
   dislocation density and flat surface morphology which is evidenced by
   the X-ray diffraction omega-scan, room temperature photoluminescence,
   and atomic force microscopy analysis. Such relaxation of AlN upon GaN
   deposition is only observed for relatively thin AlN templates with
   thicknesses of 20 nm-30 nm; this effect is negligible for AlN with
   thickness of 50 nm and above. As the thicker AlN templates already
   themselves relax before the GaN deposition, the localized strain fields
   around the misfit dislocations prohibit further change of lattice
   parameters. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A printed monopole ultra-wideband antenna with reduced ground plane
   effect is presented. The ground plane dependence of the antenna is
   reduced by cutting a slot in the radiator, and then introducing a strip
   in the slot, to reduce the current distribution on the ground plane at a
   desired frequency. At this frequency, the impedance performance of the
   antenna is mainly affected by the monopole radiator, thus reducing the
   effect of the ground plane on the antenna. Measurement results confirm
   that this approach works well and also show good far-field properties of
   the antenna. The antenna is printed on a small FR4 substrate with an
   area of 25 mm(2); it achieves an impedance bandwidth of 3.6 to over 11
   GHz, and broadband ground plane effect suppression around the design
   frequency of 5 GHz.}},

Title = {{Magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of myocardium imaged by
   cardiovascular magnetic resonance reflects the anisotropy of myocardial
   filament alpha-helix polypeptide bonds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: A key component of evaluating myocardial tissue function is
   the assessment of myofiber organization and structure. Studies suggest
   that striated muscle fibers are magnetically anisotropic, which, if
   measurable in the heart, may provide a tool to assess myocardial
   microstructure and function.
   Methods: To determine whether this weak anisotropy is observable and
   spatially quantifiable with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR),
   both gradient-echo and diffusion-weighted data were collected from
   intact mouse heart specimens at 9.4 Tesla. Susceptibility anisotropy was
   experimentally calculated using a voxelwise analysis of myocardial
   tissue susceptibility as a function of myofiber angle. A myocardial
   tissue simulation was developed to evaluate the role of the known
   diamagnetic anisotropy of the peptide bond in the observed
   susceptibility contrast.
   Results: The CMR data revealed that myocardial tissue fibers that were
   parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction appeared
   relatively paramagnetic and diamagnetic, respectively. A linear
   relationship was found between the magnetic susceptibility of the
   myocardial tissue and the squared sine of the myofiber angle with
   respect to the field direction. The multi-filament model simulation
   yielded susceptibility anisotropy values that reflected those found in
   the experimental data, and were consistent that this anisotropy
   decreased as the echo time increased.
   Conclusions: Though other sources of susceptibility anisotropy in
   myocardium may exist, the arrangement of peptide bonds in the
   myofilaments is a significant, and likely the most dominant source of
   susceptibility anisotropy. This anisotropy can be further exploited to
   probe the integrity and organization of myofibers in both healthy and
   diseased heart tissue.}},

Abstract = {{During bacterial growth, a cell approximately doubles in size before
   division, after which it splits into two daughter cells. This process is
   subjected to the inherent perturbations of cellular noise(1,2) and thus
   requires regulation for cell-size homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying
   the control and dynamics of cell size remain poorly understood owing to
   the difficulty in sizing individual bacteria over long periods of time
   in a high-throughput manner. Here we measure and analyse long-term,
   single-cell growth and division across different Escherichia coli
   strains and growth conditions(3). We show that a subset of cells in a
   population exhibit transient oscillations in cell size with periods that
   stretch across several (more than ten) generations. Our analysis reveals
   that a simple law governing cell-size control-a noisy linear
   map-explains the origins of these cell-size oscillations across all
   strains. This noisy linear map implements a negative feedback on
   cell-size control: a cell with a larger initial size tends to divide
   earlier, whereas one with a smaller initial size tends to divide later.
   Combining simulations of cell growth and division with experimental
   data, we demonstrate that this noisy linear map generates transient
   oscillations, not just in cell size, but also in constitutive gene
   expression. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of
   bacterial cell-size regulation with implications for the physiological
   processes involved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of GaAs1-xBix
   film using density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling to
   understand the growth of this film, especially the mechanisms of Bi
   incorporation. We study the stable adsorption structures and kinetics of
   the incident molecules (As-2 molecule, Ga atom, Bi atom, and Bi-2
   molecule) on the (2 x 1)-Ga-sub parallel to Bi surface and a proposed
   q(1 x 1)-Ga-sub parallel to AsAs surface, where Ga-sub parallel to XY
   refers to a Ga-terminated GaAs(001) substrate with surface layers of X
   and Y. The q(1 x 1)-Ga-sub parallel to AsAs surface has a quasi-(1 x 1)
   As layer above the Ga-terminated GaAs substrate and a randomly oriented
   As dimer layer on top. We obtain the desorption and diffusion barriers
   of the adsorbed molecules and also the reaction barriers of three key
   processes related to Bi evolution, namely, Bi incorporation, As/Bi
   exchange, and Bi clustering. The results help explain the experimentally
   observed dependence of Bi incorporation on the As/Ga ratio and growth
   temperature. Furthermore, we find that As-2 exchange with Bi of the (2 x
   1)-Ga-sub parallel to Bi surface is a key step controlling the kinetics
   of the Bi incorporation. Finally, we explore two possible methods to
   enhance the Bi incorporation, namely, replacing the MBE growth mode from
   codeposition of all fluxes with a sequential deposition of fluxes and
   applying asymmetric in-plane strain to the substrate.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we discuss the design, fabrication, and experimental
   characterization of a bi-layer fully functional near-perfect
   metamaterial absorber (MMA) in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR),
   which is broadband and generally insensitive to polarization up to a 60
   degrees incidence angle. A spectral absorptance of >= 99\% was attained
   simultaneously at multiple LWIR wavelengths, with a bandwidth of 2 mu m
   where the absorptance is >= 90\%. This remarkable behavior is attributed
   to the strong mixing of coupling modes between the two resonators and
   the ground plane in the presence of a lossy dielectric, in which single
   layer structures do not exhibit. Furthermore, we show, by comparing two
   different MMA structures, how the absorption can be tailored by design
   within and across several IR subdivisions through a slight change in
   geometrical parameters. The bi-layer MMA has the immediate application
   of a functionally versatile, low-profile thermal sensor or emitter. (C)

Abstract = {{The p53 tumor suppressor regulates transcription of genes associated
   with diverse cellular functions including apoptosis, growth arrest, DNA
   repair and differentiation. Recently, we established that p53 can
   modulate expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) innate immunity genes
   but the degree of cross-talk between p53 and TLR pathways remained
   unclear. Here, using gene expression profiling we characterize the
   global effect of p53 on the TLR5-mediated transcription in MCF7 cells.
   We found that combined activation of p53 and TLR5 pathways
   synergistically increases expression of over 200 genes, mostly
   associated with immunity and inflammation. The synergy was observed in
   several human cancer cells and primary lymphocytes. The p53-dependent
   amplification of transcriptional response to TLR5 activation required
   expression of NF kappa B subunit p65 and was mediated by several
   molecular mechanisms including increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP
   kinase, PI3K and STAT3 signaling. Additionally, p53 induction increased
   cytokine expression in response to TNF alpha, another activator of NF
   kappa B and MAP kinase pathways, suggesting a broad interaction between
   p53 and these signaling pathways. The expression of many synergistically
   induced genes is elevated in breast cancer patients responsive to
   chemotherapy. We suggest that p53's capacity to enhance immune response
   could be exploited to increase antitumor immunity and to improve cancer
   treatment.}},

   electrically active, non-contractile hybrid cells}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Cardiac cell therapies involving bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal
   stem cells (hMSCs) have shown promising results, although their
   mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated
   direct interactions between hMSCs and cardiomyocytes in vitro. Using a
   genetic Ca2+ indicator gCaMP3 to efficiently label hMSCs in co-cultures
   with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), we determined that
   25-40\% of hMSCs (from 4 independent donors) acquired periodic Ca2+
   transients and cardiac markers through spontaneous fusion with NRVMs.
   Sharp electrode and voltage-clamp recordings in fused cells showed
   action potential properties and Ca2+ current amplitudes in between those
   of non-fused hMSCs and NRVMs. Time-lapse video-microscopy revealed the
   first direct evidence of active fusion between hMSCs and NRVMs within
   several hours of co-culture. Application of blebbistatin, nifedipine or
   verapamil caused complete and reversible inhibition of fusion,
   suggesting potential roles for actomyosin bridging and Ca2+ channels in
   the fusion process. Immunostaining for Cx43, Ki67, and sarcomeric
   a-actinin showed that fused cells remain strongly coupled to surrounding
   NRVMs, but downregulate sarcomeric structures over time, acquiring a
   non-proliferative and non-contractile phenotype. Overall, these results
   describe the phenotype and mechanisms of hybrid cell formation via
   fusion of hMSCs and cardiomyocytes with potential implications for
   cardiac cell therapy.}},

Title = {{Building an organic computing device with multiple interconnected brains}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Recently, we proposed that Brainets, i.e. networks formed by multiple
   animal brains, cooperating and exchanging information in real time
   through direct brain-to-brain interfaces, could provide the core of a
   new type of computing device: an organic computer. Here, we describe the
   first experimental demonstration of such a Brainet, built by
   interconnecting four adult rat brains. Brainets worked by concurrently
   recording the extracellular electrical activity generated by populations
   of cortical neurons distributed across multiple rats chronically
   implanted with multi-electrode arrays. Cortical neuronal activity was
   recorded and analyzed in real time, and then delivered to the
   somatosensory cortices of other animals that participated in the Brainet
   using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). Using this approach,
   different Brainet architectures solved a number of useful computational
   problems, such as discrete classification, image processing, storage and
   retrieval of tactile information, and even weather forecasting. Brainets
   consistently performed at the same or higher levels than single rats in
   these tasks. Based on these findings, we propose that Brainets could be
   used to investigate animal social behaviors as well as a test bed for
   exploring the properties and potential applications of organic
   computers.}},

Title = {{Computing Arm Movements with a Monkey Brainet}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) extract motor commands
   from a single brain to control the movements of artificial devices.
   Here, we introduce a Brainet that utilizes very-large-scale brain
   activity (VLSBA) from two (B2) or three (B3) nonhuman primates to engage
   in a common motor behaviour. A B2 generated 2D movements of an avatar
   arm where each monkey contributed equally to X and Y coordinates; or one
   monkey fully controlled the X-coordinate and the other controlled the
   Y-coordinate. A B3 produced arm movements in 3D space, while each monkey
   generated movements in 2D subspaces (X-Y, Y-Z, or X-Z). With long-term
   training we observed increased coordination of behavior, increased
   correlations in neuronal activity between different brains, and
   modifications to neuronal representation of the motor plan. Overall,
   performance of the Brainet improved owing to collective monkey
   behaviour. These results suggest that primate brains can be integrated
   into a Brainet, which self-adapts to achieve a common motor goal.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic and geometric properties of arteries have been long
   recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular disease. This work
   presents a robust technique for the noninvasive characterization of
   anisotropic elastic properties as well as thickness and diameter in
   arterial vessels. In our approach, guided waves are excited along
   arteries using the radiation force of ultrasound. Group velocity is used
   as the quantity of interest to reconstruct elastic and geometric
   features of the vessels. One of the main contributions of this work is a
   systematic approach based on sparse-grid collocation interpolation to
   construct surrogate models of arteries. These surrogate models are in
   turn used with direct- search optimization techniques to produce fast
   and accurate estimates of elastic properties, diameter, and thickness.
   One of the attractive features of the proposed approach is that once a
   surrogate model is built, it can be used for near real- time
   identification across many different types of arteries. We demonstrate
   the feasibility of the method using simulated and in vitro laboratory
   experiments on a silicon rubber tube and a porcine carotid artery. Our
   results show that using our proposed method, we can reliably identify
   the longitudinal modulus, thickness, and diameter of arteries. The
   circumferential modulus was found to have little influence in the group
   velocity, which renders the former quantity unidentifiable using the
   current experimental setting. Future work will consider the measurement
   of circumferential waves with the objective of improving the
   identifiability of the circumferential modulus.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to characterize the changes seen from incident Monte
   Carlo-based scatter distributions in dedicated three-dimensional (3-D)
   breast single-photon emission computed tomography, with emphasis on the
   impact of scatter correction using the dual-energy window (DEW) method.
   Changes in scatter distributions with 3-D detector position were
   investigated for prone breast imaging with an ideal detector. Energy
   spectra within a high-energy scatter window measured from simulations
   were linearly fit, and the slope was used to characterize scatter
   distributions. The impact of detector position on the measured scatter
   fraction within various photopeak windows and the k value (ratio of
   scatter within the photopeak and scatter energy windows) useful for
   scatter correction was determined. Results indicate that application of
   a single k value with the DEW method in the presence of anisotropic
   object scatter distribution is not appropriate for trajectories
   including the heart and liver. The scatter spectra's slope demonstrates
   a strong correlation to measured k values. Reconstructions of fixed-tilt
   3-D acquisition trajectories with a single k value show quantification
   errors up to 5\% compared to primary-only reconstructions. However, a
   variable-tilt trajectory provides improved sampling and minimizes
   quantification errors, and thus allows for a single k value to be used
   with the DEW method leading to more accurate quantification. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to characterize and optimize gridding
   reconstruction of 3D radial hyperpolarized (HP) Xe-129 MRI. In support
   of this objective, we developed a flexible, open source reconstruction
   software package in MATLAB to optimally reconstruct radially acquired,
   undersampled HP Xe-129 MRI. Using this framework, we demonstrate the
   effects of 5 key reconstruction parameters: overgridding, gridding
   kernel function, kernel sharpness, kernel extent, and the density
   compensation algorithm. We further demonstrate how each parameter can be
   tuned to optimize a high-resolution 3D radially acquired HP Xe-129 image
   of a ventilated mouse. Specifically, wrap-around artifact, caused by
   non-selective RF excitation of signal in the trachea, was eliminated by
   overgridding onto a finely spaced k-space grid; high-frequency aliasing
   was reduced using iterative density compensation; image SNR and
   sharpness were optimized by tuning kernel sharpness; and computational
   burden was minimized by defining an appropriate kernel extent. Compared
   to our previous reconstruction methods, this optimized method extended
   visualization from the 5th to 6th generation of mouse airway, while
   maintaining comparable SNR. Although optimized here for preclinical
   mouse MRI, this work suggests that 3D radial acquisition offers many
   broader advantages to undersampled HP gas MRI. Using the methods
   presented here, we maintained image quality across datasets acquired
   with various degrees of undersampling and differing SNR by adjusting
   only a single parameter. These methods are now available to optimize
   radially acquired hyperpolarized gas images in both the clinical and
   preclinical arena. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson

Abstract = {{Bioaccumulation of methylmercury in the aquatic food web is governed in
   part by the methylation of inorganic divalent mercury (Hg(II)) by
   anaerobic microorganisms. In sulfidic settings, a small fraction of
   total Hg(II) is typically bioavailable to methylating microorganisms.
   Quantification of this fraction is difficult due to uncertainties in the
   speciation of Hg(II) and the mechanisms of uptake by methylating
   microbes. However, recent studies have shown that the bioavailable
   fraction is likely to include a portion of Hg(II) associated with solid
   phases, that is, nanostructured mercuric sulfides. Moreover, addition of
   thiols to suspensions of methylating cultures coincides with increased
   uptake into cells and methylmercury production. Here, we present a
   thiol-based selective extraction assay to provide information on the
   bioavailable Hg fraction in sediments. In the procedure, sediment
   samples were exposed to a nitrogen-purged solution of glutathione (GSH)
   for 30min and the amount of GSH-leachable mercury was quantified. In
   nine sediment samples from a marine location, the relative GSH-leachable
   mercury concentration was strongly correlated to the relative amount of
   methylmercury in the sediments (r(2)=0.91, p<0.0001) across an order of
   magnitude of methylmercury concentration values. The approach was
   further applied to anaerobic sediment slurry microcosm experiments in
   which sediments were cultured under the same microbial growth conditions
   but were amended with multiple forms of Hg with a known spectrum of
   bioavailability. GSH-leachable Hg concentrations increased with observed
   methylmercury concentrations in the microcosms, matching the trend of
   species bioavailability in our previous work. Results suggest that a
   thiol-based selective leaching approach is an improvement compared with
   other proposed methods to assess Hg bioavailability in sediment and that
   this approach could provide a basis for comparison of sites where Hg
   methylation is a concern.}},

Abstract = {{In 1960, von Foerster et al. humorously predicted an abrupt transition
   in human population growth to occur in the mid-21st century. Their
   so-called `Doomsday' emerged from either progressive degradation of a
   finite resource or faster-than-exponential growth of an increasingly
   resource-use efficient population, though what constitutes this resource
   was not made explicit. At present, few dispute the claim that water is
   the most fundamental resource to sustainable human population growth.
   Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the global water system
   exhibits nontrivial dynamics linked to similar patterns in population
   growth. Projections of the global water system range from a finite
   carrying capacity regulated by accessible freshwater, or `peak renewable
   water,' to punctuated evolution with new supplies and improved
   efficiency gained from technological and social innovation. These
   projections can be captured, to first order, by a single delay
   differential equation with human-water interactions parameterized as a
   delay kernel that links present water supply to the population history
   and its impacts on water resources. This kernel is a macroscopic
   representation of social, environmental, and technological factors
   operating in the human-water system; however, the mathematical form
   remains unconstrained by available data. A related model of
   log-periodic, power-law growth confirms that global water use evolves
   through repeated periods of rapid growth and stagnation, a pattern
   remarkably consistent with historical anecdotes. Together, these models
   suggest a possible regime shift leading to a new phase of water
   innovation in the mid-21st century that arises from delayed feedback
   between population growth and development of water resources. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Recent advances in unmanned and autonomous vehicle technology are
   accelerating the push to integrate these vehicles into human-centered
   environments such as commercial aviation and public roads. Much of the
   current research into autonomous systems examines improving the
   performance of individual unmanned vehicles or improving the safety of
   their interactions with individual humans; very little examines the
   behavior of the broader system. For large-scale transportation systems,
   real-world field trials involving unmanned vehicles are difficult to
   execute due to concerns of cost, feasibility of construction, and the
   maturity of the technologies. This paper describes the use of an
   agent-based model of unmanned vehicle behavior in human-centered
   environments to explore the effects of their implementation in these
   domains. In particular, this work explores how safety protocols
   governing the integration of manned and unmanned vehicles affect
   performance in an aircraft carrier ground control environment. Three
   different types of futuristic unmanned vehicle control architectures are
   considered in conjunction with four different types of safety protocols:
   dynamic, area, temporal, and combined area-plus-temporal separation.
   Results demonstrate that measures of safety vary widely across these
   systems, demonstrating distinct tradeoffs of safety and mission
   performance, as well as across different safety measures.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its non-conformity to Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST),
   the effects of thermal stratification on scaling laws describing the
   streamwise turbulent intensity sigma(u) normalized by the turbulent
   friction velocity (u) continue to draw research attention. A spectral
   budget method has been developed to assess the variability of sigma(u)/u
   under unstable atmospheric stratification. At least three different
   length-scalesthe distance from the ground (z), the height of the
   atmospheric boundary layer (delta) and the Obukhov length (L)-are all
   found to be controlling parameters in the variation of sigma(u)/u.
   Analytical models have been developed and supported by experiments for
   two limiting conditions: z/ < 0.02, -z/L < 0.5 and 0.02 << z/delta <
   0.1, -z/L > 0.5. Under the first constraint, the turbulent kinetic
   energy spectrum is predicted to follow three regimes: k(0), k(-1) and
   k(-5/3), divided in the last two regimes by a break-point at kz = 1,
   where k denotes the wave number. The quantity sigma(u)/u is shown to
   follow the much discussed logarithmic scaling, reconciled to Townsend's
   attached eddy hypothesis sigma(2)(u)/u({*})(2) = B-1 - A(1)
   log(z/delta), where the coefficients B-1 and A(1) are modified by MOST
   for mildly unstable stratification. Under the second constraint, the
   turbulent energy spectrum tends to become quasi-inertial, displaying
   k(0) and k(-5/3) with a break-point predicted to occur at 0.3 < kz < 1.
   The work here brings together well-established but seemingly unrelated
   theories of turbulence such as Kolmogorov's hypothesis, Townsend's
   attached eddy hypothesis, MOST and Heisenberg's eddy viscosity under a
   common framework.}},

Abstract = {{In the future, Earth will be warmer, precipitation events will be more
   extreme, global mean sea level will rise, and many arid and semiarid
   regions will be drier. Human modifications of landscapes will also occur
   at an accelerated rate as developed areas increase in size and
   population density. We now have gridded global forecasts, being
   continually improved, of the climatic and land use changes (C\&LUC) that
   are likely to occur in the coming decades. However, besides a few
   exceptions, consensus forecasts do not exist for how these C\&LUC will
   likely impact Earth-surface processes and hazards. In some cases, we
   have the tools to forecast the geomorphic responses to likely future
   C\&LUC. Fully exploiting these models and utilizing these tools will
   require close collaboration among Earth-surface scientists and
   Earth-system modelers. This paper assesses the state-of-the-art tools
   and data that are being used or could be used to forecast changes in the
   state of Earth's surface as a result of likely future C\&LUC. We also
   propose strategies for filling key knowledge gaps, emphasizing where
   additional basic research and/or collaboration across disciplines are
   necessary. The main body of the paper addresses cross-cutting issues,
   including the importance of nonlinear/threshold-dominated interactions
   among topography, vegetation, and sediment transport, as well as the
   importance of alternate stable states and extreme, rare events for
   understanding and forecasting Earth-surface response to C\&LUC. Five
   supplements delve into different scales or process zones (global-scale
   assessments and fluvial, aeolian, glacial/periglacial, and coastal
   process zones) in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration (ET), especially in the mainland of the Indochina
   Peninsula, can impact and is impacted by the Asian monsoonal (AM)
   system, thereby prompting interest in its long-term variability. To
   separate the physical and biological factors controlling ET variability
   in a tropical deciduous forest under the AM influence, 7year eddy
   covariance and ancillary measurements were collected and analyzed. The
   7year mean rainfall (P-r) and ET along with their standard deviations
   were 1335256 and 977108mm (about 73\% of P-r), respectively, suggesting
   close coupling between these two hydrologic fluxes. However, other
   physical and biological drivers decouple seasonal and annual variations
   of ET from P-r. To explore them, a big-leaf model complemented by
   perturbation analysis was employed. The big-leaf model agreed well with
   the measured ET at daily to multiyear time scales, lending confidence in
   its ability to separate biological and physical controls on ET. Using
   this formulation, both first-order and second-order Taylor series
   expansions of the total ET derivatives were applied to the big-leaf
   model and compared with measured changes in ET (dET). Higher-order and
   joint terms in the second-order expansion were necessary for matching
   measured and analyzed dET. Vapor pressure deficit (D) was the primary
   external physical controlling driver of ET. Leaf area index (LAI) and
   bulk stomatal conductance (g(s)) were shown to be the main significant
   biological drivers of the transpiration component of ET. It can be
   surmised that rainfall variability controls long-term ET through
   physical (mainly D) and biological (mainly LAI and g(s)) factors in this
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Human societies are increasingly altering the water and biogeochemical
   cycles to both improve ecosystem productivity and reduce risks
   associated with the unpredictable variability of climatic drivers. These
   alterations, however, often cause large negative environmental
   consequences, raising the question as to how societies can ensure a
   sustainable use of natural resources for the future. Here we discuss how
   ecohydrological modeling may address these broad questions with special
   attention to agroecosystems. The challenges related to modeling the
   two-way interaction between society and environment are illustrated by
   means of a dynamical model in which soil and water quality supports the
   growth of human society but is also degraded by excessive pressure,
   leading to critical transitions and sustained societal growth-collapse
   cycles. We then focus on the coupled dynamics of soil water and solutes
   (nutrients or contaminants), emphasizing the modeling challenges,
   presented by the strong nonlinearities in the soil and plant system and
   the unpredictable hydroclimatic forcing, that need to be overcome to
   quantitatively analyze problems of soil water sustainability in both
   natural and agricultural ecosystems. We discuss applications of this
   framework to problems of irrigation, soil salinization, and
   fertilization and emphasize how optimal solutions for large-scale,
   long-term planning of soil and water resources in agroecosystems under
   uncertainty could be provided by methods from stochastic control,
   informed by physically and mathematically sound descriptions of
   ecohydrological and biogeochemical interactions.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Typical emitters such as molecules, quantum dots and semiconductor
   quantum wells have slow spontaneous emission with lifetimes of 1-10 ns,
   creating a mismatch with high-speed nanoscale optoelectronic devices
   such as light-emitting diodes, single-photon sources and lasers. Here we
   experimentally demonstrate an ultrafast (<11 ps) yet efficient source of
   spontaneous emission, corresponding to an emission rate exceeding 90
   GHz, using a hybrid structure of single plasmonic nanopatch antennas
   coupled to colloidal quantum dots. The antennas consist of silver
   nanocubes coupled to a gold film separated by a thin polymer spacer
   layer and colloidal core-shell quantum dots, a stable and
   technologically relevant emitter. We show an increase in the spontaneous
   emission rate of a factor of 880 and simultaneously a 2,300-fold
   enhancement in the total fluorescence intensity, which indicates a high
   radiative quantum efficiency of similar to 50\%. The nanopatch antenna
   geometry can be tuned from the visible to the near infrared, providing a
   promising approach for nanophotonics based on ultrafast spontaneous
   emission.}},

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)
   represent promising cell sources for angiogenic therapies. There are,
   however, conflicting reports regarding the ability of MSCs to support
   network formation of endothelial cells. The goal of this study was to
   assess the ability of human bone marrow-derived MSCs to support network
   formation of endothelial outgrowth cells (EOCs) derived from umbilical
   cord blood EPCs. We hypothesized that upon in vitro coculture, MSCs and
   EOCs promote a microenvironment conducive for EOC network formation
   without the addition of angiogenic growth supplements. EOC networks
   formed by coculture with MSCs underwent regression and cell loss by day
   10 with a near 4-fold and 2-fold reduction in branch points and mean
   segment length, respectively, in comparison with networks formed by
   coculture vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) cocultures. EOC network
   regression in MSC cocultures was not caused by lack of vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A or changes in TGF-beta 1 or Ang-2
   supernatant concentrations in comparison with SMC cocultures. Removal of
   CD45+ cells from MSCs improved EOC network formation through a 2-fold
   increase in total segment length and number of branch points in
   comparison to unsorted MSCs by day 6. These improvements, however, were
   not sustained by day 10. CD45 expression in MSC cocultures correlated
   with EOC network regression with a 5-fold increase between day 6 and day
   10 of culture. The addition of supplemental growth factors VEGF,
   fibroblastic growth factor-2, EGF, hydrocortisone, insulin growth
   factor-1, ascorbic acid, and heparin to MSC cocultures promoted stable
   EOC network formation over 2 weeks in vitro, without affecting CD45
   expression, as evidenced by a lack of significant differences in total
   segment length (p = 0.96). These findings demonstrate the ability of
   MSCs to support EOC network formation correlates with removal of CD45+
   cells and improves upon the addition of soluble growth factors.}},

Abstract = {{Successful engineering of complex organs requires improved methods to
   promote rapid and stable vascularization of artificial tissue scaffolds.
   Toward this goal, tissue engineering strategies utilize the release of
   pro-angiogenic growth factors, alone or in combination, from
   biomaterials to induce angiogenesis. In this study we have used
   intravital microscopy to define key, dynamic cellular changes induced by
   the release of pro-angiogenic factors from polyethylene glycol
   diacrylate hydrogels transplanted in vivo. Our data show robust
   macrophage recruitment when the potent and synergistic angiogenic
   factors, PDGFBB and FGF2 were used as compared with VEGF alone and
   intravital imaging suggested roles for macrophages in endothelial tip
   cell migration and anastomosis, as well as pericyte-like behavior.
   Further data from in vivo experiments show that delivery of CSF1 with
   VEGF can dramatically improve the poor angiogenic response seen with
   VEGF alone. These studies show that incorporating macrophage-recruiting
   factors into the design of pro-angiogenic biomaterial scaffolds is a key
   strategy likely to be necessary for stable vascularization and survival
   of implanted artificial tissues.}},

Abstract = {{We previously described a novel beamforming method that images the
   spatial correlation of an echo wave field with demonstrated applications
   to clutter reduction in high-noise environments. In this paper, several
   characteristics of the resolution and brightness of short-lag spatial
   coherence (SLSC) images formed by this method are compared with B-mode
   images formed by conventional delay-and-sum beamforming methods. Point
   target widths were measured to estimate resolution, the autocorrelation
   of image texture was measured to estimate texture size, and the contrast
   (i.e., brightness ratio) of clinically relevant targets was assessed.
   SLSC images demonstrate improved resolution and contrast with increasing
   values of channel noise and clutter, whereas B-mode resolution was
   degraded in the presence of high noise (i.e., > -12 dB channel
   noise-to-signal ratios) and high clutter magnitudes (i.e., > -21 dB
   relative to point target magnitude). Lateral resolution in SLSC images
   was improved with increasing lag value, whereas axial resolution was
   degraded with increasing correlation kernel length. The texture size of
   SLSC images was smaller than that of matched B-mode images. Results
   demonstrate that the resolution and contrast of coherence-based images
   depend on a range of parameters, but are generally superior to those of
   matched B-mode images under challenging imaging conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a therapy used to treat intractable
   pain with a putative mechanism of action based on the Gate Control
   Theory. We hypothesized that sensory projection neuron responses to SCS
   would follow a single stereotyped response curve as a function of SCS
   frequency, as predicted by the Gate Control circuit. We recorded the
   responses of antidromically identified sensory projection neurons in the
   lumbar spinal cord during 1- to 150-Hz SCS in both healthy rats and
   neuropathic rats following chronic constriction injury (CCI). The
   relationship between SCS frequency and projection neuron activity
   predicted by the Gate Control circuit accounted for a subset of neuronal
   responses to SCS but could not account for the full range of observed
   responses. Heterogeneous responses were classifiable into three
   additional groups and were reproduced using computational models of
   spinal microcircuits representing other interactions between nociceptive
   and nonnociceptive sensory inputs. Intrathecal administration of
   bicuculline, a GABA A receptor antagonist, increased spontaneous and
   evoked activity in projection neurons, enhanced excitatory responses to
   SCS, and reduced inhibitory responses to SCS, suggesting that GABA A
   neurotransmission plays a broad role in regulating projection neuron
   activity. These in vivo and computational results challenge the Gate
   Control Theory as the only mechanism underlying SCS and refine our
   understanding of the effects of SCS on spinal sensory neurons within the
   framework of contemporary understanding of dorsal horn circuitry.}},

Title = {{Development of realistic physical breast phantoms matched to virtual
   breast phantoms based on human subject data}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Physical phantoms are essential for the development,
   optimization, and evaluation of x-ray breast imaging systems.
   Recognizing the major effect of anatomy on image quality and clinical
   performance, such phantoms should ideally reflect the three-dimensional
   structure of the human breast. Currently, there is no commercially
   available three-dimensional physical breast phantom that is
   anthropomorphic. The authors present the development of a new suite of
   physical breast phantoms based on human data.
   Methods: The phantoms were designed to match the extended cardiac-torso
   virtual breast phantoms that were based on dedicated breast computed
   tomography images of human subjects. The phantoms were fabricated by
   high-resolution multimaterial additive manufacturing (3D printing)
   technology. The glandular equivalency of the photopolymer materials was
   measured relative to breast tissue-equivalent plastic materials. Based
   on the current state-of-the-art in the technology and available
   materials, two variations were fabricated. The first was a dual-material
   phantom, the Doublet. Fibroglandular tissue and skin were represented by
   the most radiographically dense material available; adipose tissue was
   represented by the least radiographically dense material. The second
   variation, the Singlet, was fabricated with a single material to
   represent fibroglandular tissue and skin. It was subsequently filled
   with adipose-equivalent materials including oil, beeswax, and permanent
   urethane-based polymer. Simulated microcalcification clusters were
   further included in the phantoms via crushed eggshells. The phantoms
   were imaged and characterized visually and quantitatively.
   Results: The mammographic projections and tomosynthesis reconstructed
   images of the fabricated phantoms yielded realistic breast background.
   The mammograms of the phantoms demonstrated close correlation with
   simulated mammographic projection images of the corresponding virtual
   phantoms. Furthermore, power-law descriptions of the phantom images were
   in general agreement with real human images. The Singlet approach
   offered more realistic contrast as compared to the Doublet approach, but
   at the expense of air bubbles and air pockets that formed during the
   filling process.
   Conclusions: The presented physical breast phantoms and their matching
   virtual breast phantoms offer realistic breast anatomy, patient
   variability, and ease of use, making them a potential candidate for
   performing both system quality control testing and virtual clinical
   trials. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an extreme biomimetics route for the creation of
   nanostructured biocomposites utilizing a chitinous template of poriferan
   origin. The specific thermal stability of the nanostructured chitinous
   template allowed for the formation under hydrothermal conditions of a
   novel germanium oxide-chitin composite with a defined nanoscale
   structure. Using a variety of analytical techniques (FTIR, Raman, energy
   dispersive X-ray (EDX), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
   (NEXAFS), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, EDS-mapping, selected
   area for the electron diffraction pattern (SAEDP), and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM)), we showed that this bioorganic scaffold
   induces the growth of GeO2 nanocrystals with a narrow (150-300 nm) size
   distribution and predominantly hexagonal phase, demonstrating the chitin
   template's control over the crystal morphology. The formed GeO2-chitin
   composite showed several specific physical properties, such as a
   striking enhancement in photoluminescence exceeding values previously
   reported in GeO2-based biomaterials. These data demonstrate the
   potential of extreme biomimetics for developing new-generation

   discontinuous preictal recordings were observed as the amount of time

   that the classification performance for patients with large time gaps

   the classification performance for patients with contiguous preictal and
   interictal files. These results provide evidence that time likely plays
   a major role in the discriminability of the iEEG features considered in
   this study, regardless of the underlying seizure state. Feature
   nonstationarity is present and may, under certain conditions, lead to
   overestimation or underestimation of the probability of seizure
   occurrence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the adaptation of frequency modulated continuous
   wave (FMCW) radars for sensor data exfiltration in addition to their
   primary use in area surveillance. In particular, the application of
   wideband RF backscatter from semi-passive RF sensor nodes for
   simultaneous ranging and wireless telemetry uplink to an FMCW radar is
   examined. We present an upper bound on data communication rates for
   baseband-coded binary backscatter modulation given a particular sensor
   node density and radar parameters, as well as a method for line coding
   to mitigate stationary clutter. Proof-of-principle measurements using a
   brass-board S-band radar with center frequency of 2.45 GHz and 40-MHz
   bandwidth show the simultaneous ranging and demodulation of two sensor
   nodes at ranges of 15 and 33 m in a cluttered indoor environment. In
   this demonstration, a signaling rate of 10 kbit/s per sensor with a bit
   error rate below the measurable threshold of 4 x 10(-3) is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality training systems are commonly used in a variety of
   domains, and it is important to understand how the realism of a training
   simulation influences training effectiveness. We conducted a controlled
   experiment to test the effects of display and scenario properties on
   training effectiveness for a visual scanning task in a simulated urban
   environment. The experiment varied the levels of field of view and
   visual complexity during a training phase and then evaluated scanning
   performance with the simulator's highest levels of fidelity and scene
   complexity. To assess scanning performance, we measured target detection
   and adherence to a prescribed strategy. The results show that both field
   of view and visual complexity significantly affected target detection
   during training; higher field of view led to better performance and
   higher visual complexity worsened performance. Additionally, adherence
   to the prescribed visual scanning strategy during assessment was best
   when the level of visual complexity during training matched that of the
   assessment conditions, providing evidence that similar visual complexity
   was important for learning the technique. The results also demonstrate
   that task performance during training was not always a sufficient
   measure of mastery of an instructed technique. That is, if learning a
   prescribed strategy or skill is the goal of a training exercise,
   performance in a simulation may not be an appropriate indicator of
   effectiveness outside of training-evaluation in a more realistic setting
   may be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To explore the feasibility of using shear wave speed (SWS)
   estimates to detect differences in cervical softening pre- and
   post-ripening in women undergoing induction of labor.
   Methods Subjects at 37-41 weeks' gestation undergoing cervical ripening
   before induction of labor were recruited (n=20). Examinations, performed
   prior to administration of misoprostol and 4 h later included Bishop
   score, transvaginal ultrasound measurement of cervical length, and 10
   replicate SWS measurements using an ultrasound system equipped with a
   prototype transducer (128 element, 3mm diameter, 14mm aperture) attached
   to the clinician's hand. Subjects were divided into two groups,
   `not-in-labor' and `marked-progression', based on cervical evaluation at
   the second examination. Measurements were compared via individual paired
   hypotheses tests and using a linear mixed model, with the latter also
   used to compare groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used
   to compare SWS with Bishop score. The linear mixed model can take into
   account clustered data and accommodate multiple predictors
   simultaneously.
   Results The Wilcoxon signed-rank paired test established a significant
   difference in pre- and post-ripening SWS, with mean SWS estimates of
   2.53 +/- 0.75 and 1.54 +/- 0.31 m/s, respectively (P<0.001) in the
   not-in-labor group (decrease in stiffness) and 1.58 +/- 0.33 and 2.35
   +/- 0.65 m/s for the marked-progression group (increase in stiffness).
   The linear mixed model corroborated significant differences in pre- and
   post-ripening measurements in individual subjects (P<0.001) as well as
   between groups (P<0.0001). SWS estimates were significantly correlated
   with digitally-assessed cervical softness and marginally correlated with
   Bishop score as assessed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
   Conclusions In-vivo SWS estimates detected stiffness differences before
   and after misoprostol-induced softening in term pregnancies. This
   ultrasonic shear elasticity imaging technique shows promise for
   assessing cervical softness. Copyright (C) 2014 ISUOG. Published by John

Abstract = {{Drug-induced vascular injury (DIVI) is a serious problem in preclinical
   studies of vasoactive molecules and for survivors of pediatric cancers.
   DIVI is often observed in rodents and some larger animals, primarily
   with drugs affecting vascular tone, but not in humans; however, DIVI
   observed in animal studies often precludes a drug candidate from
   continuing along the development pipeline. Thus, there is great interest
   by the pharmkeutical industry to identify quantifiable human biomarkers
   of DIVI. Small-scale endothelialized tissue-engineered blood vessels
   using human cells represent a promising approach to screen drug
   candidates and develop alternatives to cancer therapeutics in vitro. We
   identify several technical challenges that remain to be addressed,
   including high-throughput systems to screen large numbers of candidates,
   identification of suitable cell sources and establishing and maintaining
   a differentiated state of the vessel wall cells. Adequately addressing
   these challenges should yield novel platforms to screen drugs and
   develop new therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the frequent incidence of blast-induced traumatic brain injury
   (bTBI) in recent military conflicts, there is an urgent need to develop
   effective therapies for bTBI-related pathologies. Blood-brain barrier
   (BBB) breakdown has been reported to occur after primary blast exposure,
   making restoration of BBB function and integrity a promising therapeutic
   target. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with dexamethasone (DEX)
   after primary blast injury potentiates recovery of an in vitro BBB model
   consisting of mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3). DEX treatment
   resulted in complete recovery of transendothelial electrical resistance
   and hydraulic conductivity 1 day after injury, compared with 3 days for
   vehicle-treated injured cultures. Administration of RU486 (mifepristone)
   inhibited effects of DEX, confirming that barrier restoration was
   mediated by glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Potentiated recovery with
   DEX treatment was accompanied by stronger zonula occludens (ZO)-1 tight
   junction immunostaining and expression, suggesting that increased ZO-1
   expression was a structural correlate to BBB recovery after blast.
   Interestingly, augmented ZO-1 protein expression was associated with
   specific upregulation of the alpha(+) isoform but not the alpha(-)
   isoform. This is the first study to provide a mechanistic basis for
   potentiated functional recovery of an in vitro BBB model because of
   glucocorticoid treatment after primary blast injury.}},

Title = {{A Case for Wide-Angle Breast Tomosynthesis}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{860-869}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Rationales and Objectives: Conventional mammography is largely limited
   by superimposed anatomy. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and computed
   tomography (CT) alleviate this limitation but with added out-of-plane
   artifacts or limited chest wall coverage. This article presents a
   wide-angle breast tomosynthesis (WBT), aimed to provide a practical
   solution to these limitations, and offers an initial study of its
   utility in comparison with DBT and CT using a singular evaluation
   platform.
   Materials and Methods: Using an anthropomorphic virtual breast phantom,
   a Monte Carlo code modeled a breast imaging system for three modalities
   of DBT, WBT, and breast CT (44 degrees, 99 degrees, and 198 degrees
   total angle range, respectively) at four breast compression levels, all
   at a constant mean glandular dose level of 1.5 mGy. Reconstructed
   volumes were generated using iterative reconstruction methods. Lesion
   detectability was estimated using contrast-to-noise ratio and a
   channelized Hotelling observer model in terms of the area under the
   receiver operating characteristic (AUC).
   Results: Results showed improved detection with increased angular span
   and compression. The estimated AUCs for WBT were similar to that of CT.
   Comparative performance averaged over all thicknesses between CT and WBT
   was 4.3 +/- 3.0\%, whereas that between WBT and DBT was 5.6 +/- 1.0\%.
   At compression levels reflective of the modality (7-, 5-, and 4-cm
   thickness for CT, WBT, and DBT, respectively), WBT yielded an AUC
   comparable to CT (performance difference of 1.2\%) but superior to DBT
   (performance difference of 5.5\%).
   Conclusions: The proposed imaging modality showed significant advantages
   over conventional DBT. WBT exhibited superior imaging performance over
   DBT at lower compression levels, highlighting further potential for
   reduced breast compression.}},

Abstract = {{Odontocete echolocation clicks are generated by pneumatically driven
   phonic lips within the nasal passage, and propagated through specialized
   structures within the forehead. This study investigated the highly
   derived echolocation structures of the pygmy (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf
   (K. sima) sperm whales through careful dissections (N=18 K. breviceps, 6
   K. sima) and histological examinations (N=5 K. breviceps). This study is
   the first to show that the entire kogiid sound production and
   transmission pathway is acted upon by complex facial muscles (likely
   derivations of the m. maxillonasolabialis). Muscles appear capable of
   tensing and separating the solitary pair of phonic lips, which would
   control echolocation click frequencies. The phonic lips are enveloped by
   the vocal cap, a morphologically complex, connective tissue structure
   unique to kogiids. Extensive facial muscles appear to control the
   position of this structure and its spatial relationship to the phonic
   lips. The vocal cap's numerous air crypts suggest that it may reflect
   sounds. Muscles encircling the connective tissue case that surrounds the
   spermaceti organ may change its shape and/or internal pressure. These
   actions may influence the acoustic energy transmitted from the phonic
   lips, through this lipid body, to the melon. Facial and rostral muscles
   act upon the length of the melon, suggesting that the sound beam can be
   focused as it travels through the melon and into the environment. This
   study suggests that the kogiid echolocation system is highly tunable.
   Future acoustic studies are required to test these hypotheses and gain
   further insight into the kogiid echolocation system. Anat Rec,

   measurements}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to stabilize a group of agents moving in a
   two-dimensional space to a desired rigid geometric configuration. A
   common approach is to use information of relative interagent position
   vectors to carry out this specific control task. However, existing works
   in this vein either require the agents to express their measurements in
   a global coordinate reference, or generally fail to provide global
   stability guarantees. Our contribution is a globally convergent method
   that uses relative position information expressed in each agent's local
   reference frame, and can be implemented in a distributed networked
   fashion. The proposed control strategy, which is shown to have
   exponential convergence properties, makes each agent move so as to
   minimize a cost function that encompasses all the agents in the team and
   captures the collective control objective. The coordinate-free nature of
   the method emerges through the introduction of a rotation matrix,
   computed by each agent, in the cost function. We consider that the
   agents form a nearest-neighbor communications network, and they obtain
   the required relative position information via multi-hop propagation,
   which is inherently affected by time-delays. We support the feasibility
   of such distributed networked implementation by obtaining global
   stability guarantees for the formation controller when these time-delays
   are incorporated in the analysis. The performance of our approach is
   illustrated with simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{PurposeRed bone marrow metastases are common in breast and prostate
   cancer patients, but those metastases are currently incurable. Recent
   developments show that hyperthermia could be a successful treatment for
   bone metastasis, but thermometry remains difficult or inaccurate in red
   marrow.
   MethodThe technique evaluated in this study measures the evolution
   frequency of intermolecular zero quantum coherences (iZQCs) between fat
   and water. The iZQC evolution frequency was mapped linearly to
   temperature. The temperature accuracy and coherence lifetime of the iZQC
   method were evaluated against other thermometry methods that are based
   on localized spectroscopy and multiple gradient echo imaging.
   ResultsThe temperature coefficient () was 9.80.7 ppb/degrees C with the
   iZQC method and 2 +/- 7 ppb/degrees C with traditional localized
   spectroscopy.
   ConclusionBecause the accuracy of thermometry is limited by the
   reproducibility of between samples, iZQCs provide nearly a 10-fold
   accuracy improvement in red marrow (0.7 ppb/degrees C for iZQCs versus 7
   ppb/degrees C for localized spectroscopy.) The iZQC technique in this
   study will for the first time allow accurate and quantitative thermal
   imaging of red marrow. Magn Reson Med, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods are implemented to obtain a
   quantitative characterization of the evolution of electrons and ions
   during the ignition of methane-oxygen mixtures under lean and
   stoichiometric conditions. The GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism is combined with
   an extensive set of ion chemistry pathways and the forward propagation
   of uncertainty from model parameters to observables is performed using
   response surfaces. The UQ analysis considers 22 uncertain rate
   parameters, which include both chemi-ionization, proton transfer, and
   electron attachment reactions as well as neutral reactions pertaining to
   the chemistry of the CH radical. The uncertainty ranges for each rate
   parameter are discussed. Our results indicate that the uncertainty in
   the time evolution of the electron number density is due mostly to the
   chemi-ionization reaction CH + O reversible arrow HCO+ + E- and to the
   main CH consumption reaction CH + O-2 reversible arrow O + HCO. Similar
   conclusions hold for the hydronium ion H3O+, since electrons and H3O+
   account for more than 99\% of the total negative and positive charge
   density, respectively. Surprisingly, the statistics of the number
   density of charged species show very little sensitivity to the
   uncertainty in the rate of the recombination reaction H3O+ + E- ->
   products, until very late in the decay process, when the electron number
   density has fallen below 20\% of its peak value. Finally, uncertainties
   in the secondary reactions within networks leading to the formation of
   minor ions (e.g., C2H3O+, HCO+, OH-, and O-) do not play any role in
   controlling the mean and variance of electrons and H3O+, but do affect
   the statistics of the minor ions significantly. The observed trends
   point to the role of key neutral reactions in controlling the mean and
   variance of the charged species number density in an indirect fashion.
   Furthermore, total sensitivity indices provide quantitative metrics to
   focus future efforts aiming at improving the rates of key reactions
   responsible for the formation of charges during hydrocarbon combustion.

Abstract = {{For very slender structural components, self-weight may compete with
   elastic flexural stiffness in determining equilibrium configurations. In
   cases where the inherent elastic stiffness is low (relative to
   self-weight) we observe a variety of types of highly nonlinear behavior
   in the equilibrium shapes, together with changes in the natural
   frequencies of small oscillations about these equilibrium
   configurations. This technical note describes a specific phenomenon
   observed in experiments on very slender polycarbonate loops. In addition
   to profound changes in equilibrium shapes as a function of
   weight-to-stiffness ratio, under some circumstances it is possible to
   have two adjacent, co-existing equilibrium configurations. This robust,
   highly nonlinear snap-through behavior is demonstrated by perturbing
   from one shape to the other.}},

Abstract = {{The linear model, in which a set of observations is assumed to be given
   by a linear combination of columns of a matrix (often termed a
   dictionary), has long been the mainstay of the statistics and signal
   processing literature. One particular challenge for inference under
   linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary under
   which reliable inference is possible. This challenge has attracted
   renewed attention in recent years, since many modern inference problems
   (e.g., high-dimensional statistics and compressed sensing) deal with the
   underdetermined setting, in which the number of observations is much
   smaller than the number of columns in the dictionary. This paper makes
   several contributions for this setting when the set of observations is
   given by a linear combination of a small number of groups of columns of
   the dictionary, termed the block-sparse case. First, it specifies
   conditions on the dictionary under which most block submatrices of the
   dictionary (often termed block subdictionaries) are well conditioned.
   This result is fundamentally different from prior work on block-sparse
   inference because: 1) it provides conditions that can be explicitly
   computed in polynomial time; 2) the given conditions translate into
   near-optimal scaling of the number of columns of the block
   subdictionaries as a function of the number of observations for a large
   class of dictionaries; and 3) it suggests that the spectral norm, rather
   than the column/block coherences of the dictionary, fundamentally limits
   the scaling of dimensions of the well-conditioned block subdictionaries.
   Second, in order to help understand the significance of this result in
   the context of block-sparse inference, this paper investigates the
   problems of block-sparse recovery and block-sparse regression in
   underdetermined settings. In both of these problems, this paper utilizes
   its result concerning conditioning of block subdictionaries and
   establishes that near-optimal block-sparse recovery and block-sparse
   regression is possible for a large class of dictionaries as long as the
   dictionary satisfies easily computable conditions and the coefficients
   describing the linear combination of groups of columns can be modeled
   through a mild statistical prior. Third, the paper reports extensive
   numerical experiments that highlight the effects of different measures
   of the dictionary in block-sparse inference problems.}},

Abstract = {{Shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) has found success in liver fibrosis
   staging. This work evaluates hepatic SWEI measurement success as a
   function of push pulse energy using two mechanical index (MI) values
   (1.6 and 2.2) over a range of pulse durations. Shear wave speed (SWS)
   was measured in the livers of 26 study subjects with known or potential
   chronic liver diseases. Each measurement consisted of eight SWEI
   sequences, each with different push energy configurations. The rate of
   successful SWS estimation was linearly proportional to the push energy.
   SWEI measurements with higher push energy were successful in patients
   for whom standard push energy levels failed. The findings also suggest
   that liver capsule depth could be used prospectively to identify
   patients who would benefit from elevated output. We conclude that there
   is clinical benefit to using elevated acoustic output for hepatic SWS
   measurement in patients with deeper livers. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Simultaneous neural recordings taken from multiple areas of the rodent
   brain are garnering growing interest because of the insight they can
   provide about spatially distributed neural circuitry. The promise of
   such recordings has inspired great progress in methods for surgically
   implanting large numbers of metal electrodes into intact rodent brains.
   However, methods for localizing the precise location of these electrodes
   have remained severely lacking. Traditional histological techniques that
   require slicing and staining of physical brain tissue are cumbersome and
   become increasingly impractical as the number of implanted electrodes
   increases. Here we solve these problems by describing a method that
   registers 3D computed tomography (CT) images of intact rat brains
   implanted with metal electrode bundles to a magnetic resonance imaging
   histology (MRH) atlas. Our method allows accurate visualization of each
   electrode bundle's trajectory and location without removing the
   electrodes from the brain or surgically implanting external markers. In
   addition, unlike physical brain slices, once the 3D images of the
   electrode bundles and the MRH atlas are registered, it is possible to
   verify electrode placements from many angles by ``reslicing{''} the
   images along different planes of view. Furthermore, our method can be
   fully automated and easily scaled to applications with large numbers of
   specimens. Our digital imaging approach to efficiently localizing metal
   electrodes offers a substantial addition to currently available methods,
   which, in turn, may help accelerate the rate at which insights are
   gleaned from rodent network neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To characterize the first in-human intraoperative imaging using
   a custom prototype spectral-domain microscope-integrated optical
   coherence tomography (MIOCT) device during vitreoretinal surgery with
   instruments in the eye.
   Methods: Under institutional review board approval for a prospective
   intraoperative study, MIOCT images were obtained at surgical pauses with
   instruments held static in the vitreous cavity and then concurrently
   with surgical maneuvers. Postoperatively, MIOCT images obtained at
   surgical pauses were compared with images obtained with a
   high-resolution handheld spectral-domain OCT (HHOCT) system with
   objective endpoints, including acquisition of images acceptable for
   analysis and identification of predefined macular morphologic or
   pathologic features.
   Results: Human MIOCT images were successfully obtained before incision
   and during pauses in surgical maneuvers. MIOCT imaging confirmed
   preoperative diagnoses, such as epiretinal membrane, full-thickness
   macular hole, and vitreomacular traction and demonstrated successful
   achievement of surgical goals. MIOCT and HHOCT images obtained at
   surgical pauses in two cohorts of five patients were comparable with
   greater than or equal to 80\% correlation in 80\% of patients. Real-time
   video-imaging concurrent with surgical manipulations enabled, for the
   first time using this device, visualization of dynamic instrument-retina
   interaction with targeted OCT tracking.
   Conclusion: MIOCT is successful for imaging at surgical pauses and for
   real-time image guidance with implementation of targeted OCT tracking.
   Even faster acquisition speeds are currently being developed with
   incorporation of a swept-source MIOCT engine. Further refinements and
   investigations will be directed toward continued integration for
   real-time volumetric imaging of surgical maneuvers.
   Translational Relevance: Ongoing development of seamless MIOCT systems
   will likely transform surgical visualization, approaches, and
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Simplified numerical models of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are
   useful both for understanding the underlying dynamics and potentially
   providing parsimonious modelling approaches for inclusion in larger

   uniformly mixed, purely convective, diurnal ABL are shown to allow
   immediate solutions for the potential temperature and specific humidity
   as functions of the ABL height and net radiation when expressed in
   integral form. By employing a linearized saturation vapour relation, the
   height of the mixed layer is shown to obey a non-linear ordinary
   differential equation with quadratic dependence on ABL height. A
   perturbation solution provides general analytical approximations, of
   which the leading term is shown to represent the contribution under
   equilibrium evaporation. These solutions allow the diurnal evolution of
   the height, potential temperature, and specific humidity (i.e., also
   vapour pressure deficit) of the mixed layer to be expressed analytically

Abstract = {{The generation of reactive species in titanium dioxide (TiO2)
   nanoparticle photocatalysis was assessed in a laboratory scale setup, in
   which P25 Aeroxide TiO2 suspensions were photoactivated by means of UV-A
   radiation. Photogenerated holes and hydroxyl radicals were monitored
   over time by observing their selective reaction with probe compounds,
   iodide and terephthalic acid, respectively. TiO2 aggregate size and
   structure were characterized over the reaction time. Reactive species
   quenching was then described by a model, accounting for radiative
   phenomena, TiO2 nanoparticle aggregation and kinetic reactions. The
   interaction between iodide and photogenerated holes was influenced by
   iodide adsorption on TiO2 surface, described by a langmuir-Hinshelwood
   mechanism, whose parameters were studied as a function of TiO2
   concentration and irradiation time. Iodide oxidation was effectively
   simulated by modelling the reaction volume as a completely stirred
   two-dimensional domain, in which irradiation phenomena were described by
   a two-flux model and the steady state for reactive species was assumed.
   The kinetic parameters for iodide adsorption and oxidation were
   estimated and successfully validated in a different experimental setup.
   The same model was adapted to describe the oxidation of terephthalic
   acid by hydroxyl radicals. The kinetic parameters for terephthalic acid
   oxidation were estimated and validated, while the issues in
   investigating the interaction mechanisms among the involved species have
   been discussed. The sensitivity of operating parameters on model
   response was assessed and the most relevant parameters were highlighted.

Abstract = {{Emulsion-based, resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser
   evaporation (RIR-MAPLE) was used to deposit CdSe nanoparticle films and

   that, in contrast to traditional MAPLE deposition, the CdSe nanoparticle
   film deposited by emulsion based RIR-MAPLE is contiguous and uniform,
   and it maintains the optical properties of the nanoparticle solution.
   Moreover, we show that the RIR-MAPLE deposited PCPDTBT/CdSe hybrid

   of CdSe nanoparticles without the significant phase segregation that is
   observed in hybrid nanocomposite films deposited by spin-casting.
   Finally, hybrid organic solar cells based on nanocomposite films
   deposited by the RIR-MAPLE technique were fabricated and characterized,

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{A major limitation of current acoustic metamaterials is that their
   acoustic properties are either locked into place once fabricated or are
   only modestly tunable, tying them to the particular application for
   which they are designed. We present a design approach that yields active
   metamaterials whose physical structure is fixed, yet their local
   acoustic response can be changed almost arbitrarily and in real time by
   configuring the digital electronics that control the metamaterial
   acoustic properties. We demonstrate this approach experimentally by
   designing a metamaterial slab configured to act as a very thin acoustic
   lens that manipulates differently three identical, consecutive pulses
   incident on the lens. Moreover, we show that the slab can be configured
   to simultaneously implement various roles, such as that of a lens and a
   beam steering device. Finally, we show that the metamaterial slab is
   suitable for efficient second harmonic acoustic imaging devices capable
   of overcoming the diffraction limit of linear lenses. These advantages
   demonstrate the versatility of this active metamaterial and highlight
   its broad applicability, in particular, to acoustic imaging.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{This work aims at the development of a mathematical and computational
   approach that enables quantification of the inherent sources of
   stochasticity and of the corresponding sensitivities in stochastic
   simulations of chemical reaction networks. The approach is based on
   reformulating the system dynamics as being generated by independent
   standardized Poisson processes. This reformulation affords a
   straightforward identification of individual realizations for the
   stochastic dynamics of each reaction channel, and consequently a
   quantitative characterization of the inherent sources of stochasticity
   in the system. By relying on the Sobol-Hoeffding decomposition, the
   reformulation enables us to perform an orthogonal decomposition of the
   solution variance. Thus, by judiciously exploiting the inherent
   stochasticity of the system, one is able to quantify the variance-based
   sensitivities associated with individual reaction channels, as well as
   the importance of channel interactions. Implementation of the algorithms
   is illustrated in light of simulations of simplified systems, including
   the birth-death, Schlogl, and Michaelis-Menten models. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Drug delivery vehicles are often assessed for their ability to control
   primary tumor growth, but the outcome of cancer treatment depends on
   controlling or inhibiting metastasis. Therefore, we studied the efficacy
   of our genetically encoded polypeptide nanoparticle for doxorubicin
   delivery (CP-Dox) in the syngeneic metastatic murine models 4T1 and
   Lewis lung carcinoma. We found that our nanoparticle formulation
   increased the half-life, maximum tolerated dose, and tumor accumulation
   of doxorubicin. When drug treatment was combined with primary tumor
   resection, greater than 60\% of the mice were cured in both the 4T1 and
   Lewis lung carcinoma models compared to 20\% treated with free drug.
   Mechanistic studies suggest that metastasis inhibition and survival
   increase were achieved by preventing the dissemination of viable tumor

Abstract = {{The self-assembly of synthetic diblock copolymers has been extensively
   studied experimentally and theoretically. In contrast, self-assembly of
   polypeptide diblock copolymers has so far been mostly studied
   experimentally. We discovered that the theory developed for synthetic
   diblock copolymer does not fully explain the self-assembly of
   elastin-like polypeptide diblock copolymers, leading us to generalize
   the theory to make it applicable for these polypeptides. We demonstrated
   that elastin-like polypeptide diblocks self-assemble into weak micelles
   with dense cores and almost unstretched coronas, a state not previously
   observed for synthetic diblock copolymers. Weak micelles form if the
   surface tension at the core corona interface is low compared to that
   expected of a micelle with a dense core. The predictions of the theory
   of weak micelles for the critical micelle temperature, hydrodynamic
   radius, and aggregation number of elastin-like polypeptide diblocks are
   in reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured values. The
   unique and unprecedented control of amphiphilicity in these recombinant
   peptide polymers reveals a new micellar state that has not been
   previously observed in synthetic diblock copolymer systems.}},

Title = {{An Analysis of the Matching Hypothesis in Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{The matching hypothesis in social psychology claims that people are more
   likely to form a committed relationship with someone equally attractive.
   Previous works on stochastic models of human mate choice process
   indicate that patterns supporting the matching hypothesis could occur
   even when similarity is not the primary consideration in seeking
   partners. Yet, most if not all of these works concentrate on
   fully-connected systems. Here we extend the analysis to networks. Our
   results indicate that the correlation of the couple's attractiveness
   grows monotonically with the increased average degree and decreased
   degree diversity of the network. This correlation is lower in sparse
   networks than in fully-connected systems, because in the former less
   attractive individuals who find partners are likely to be coupled with
   ones who are more attractive than them. The chance of failing to be
   matched decreases exponentially with both the attractiveness and the
   degree. The matching hypothesis may not hold when the
   degree-attractiveness correlation is present, which can give rise to
   negative attractiveness correlation. Finally, we find that the ratio
   between the number of matched couples and the size of the maximum
   matching varies non-monotonically with the average degree of the
   network. Our results reveal the role of network topology in the process
   of human mate choice and bring insights into future investigations of
   different matching processes in networks.}},

Abstract = {{In an ongoing effort to address the clear clinical unmet needs
   surrounding breast conserving surgery (BCS), our group has developed a
   next-generation multiplexed optical-fiber-based tool to assess breast
   tumor margin status during initial surgeries. Specifically detailed in
   this work is the performance and clinical validation of a research-grade
   intra-operative tool for margin assessment based on diffuse optical
   spectroscopy. Previous work published by our group has illustrated the
   proof-of-concept generations of this device; here we incorporate a
   highly optimized quantitative diffuse reflectance imaging (QDRI) system
   utilizing a widefield (imaging area = 17cm(2)) 49-channel multiplexed
   fiber optic probe, a custom raster-scanning imaging platform, a custom
   dual-channel white LED source, and an astronomy grade imaging CCD and
   spectrograph. The system signal to noise ratio (SNR) was found to be
   greater than 40dB for all channels. Optical property estimation error
   was found to be less than 10\%, on average, over a wide range of
   absorption (mu(a) = 0-8.9cm(-1)) and scattering (mu(s)' = 7.0-9.7cm(-1))
   coefficients. Very low inter-channel and CCD crosstalk was observed (2\%
   max) when used on turbid media (including breast tissue). A
   raster-scanning mechanism was developed to achieve sub-pixel resolution
   and was found to be optimally performed at an upsample factor of 8,
   affording 0.75mm spatially resolved diffuse reflectance images (lambda =
   450-600nm) of an entire margin (area = 17cm(2)) in 13.8 minutes
   (1.23cm(2)/min). Moreover, controlled pressure application at the
   probe-tissue interface afforded by the imaging platform reduces repeated
   scan variability, providing <1\% variation across repeated scans of
   clinical specimens. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this device
   through a pilot 20-patient study of high-resolution optical parameter
   maps of the ratio of the beta-carotene concentration to the reduced
   scattering coefficient. An empirical cumulative distribution function
   (eCDF) analysis is used to reduce optical property maps to quantitative
   distributions representing the morphological landscape of breast tumor
   margins. The optimizations presented in this work provide an avenue to
   rapidly survey large tissue areas on intra-operative time scales with
   improved sensitivity to regions of focal disease that may otherwise be
   overlooked.}},

Abstract = {{Duckweed harvested from a swine wastewater treatment system was
   evaluated for its potential as a fermentation feedstock for the
   production of biohydrogen. The effects of pretreatment and fermentation
   conditions on biohydrogen production were investigated in
   laboratory-scale batch experiments. The results showed that mild acidic
   thermal pretreatment (1\% H2SO4 and 85 degrees C for 1 h) was more
   effective in improving the fermentability of duckweed than either
   thermal or mild alkaline thermal pretreatments. Fermentation of
   acid-pretreated duckweed resulted in a biohydrogen production of up to
   75 mL H-2 per g dry duckweed in 7 days (at a H2 concentration of 42\%),
   which is comparable with other plant biomass. Overall, the results show
   that small aquatic plants such as duckweed can be promising substrate
   for biohydrogen production. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

   of melted material is S-shaped. We also found that the fastest melting
   (i.e., the steepest S curve) is discovered by allowing the tree
   architecture to morph freely, toward greater access over time. The stem
   length and branching angle of invading trees can be selected such that
   the complete melting process is shorter. The melting process can also be
   made faster by increasing the complexity of the tree structure. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{People like to say that we cannot witness evolution because it occurred
   over a timescale immensely greater than human experience. Here, we show
   that it is possible to witness, explain, and predict evolution by
   focusing on technology evolution. We review the evolution of heat
   transfer devices from the point of view of the constructal law of design
   and evolution in nature. This is a broad view of the evolution where
   organs (components) are not stand-alone devices but play an important
   role in the live' finite-size systems that incorporate them. The larger
   systems can be human made or natural beings in which overall
   organization evolved, and continues to evolve. We show that heat
   transfer technology evolves predictably toward compactness, heat
   transfer augmentation, lower friction, and lower pumping power
   expenditure. These features are often misunderstood as competitors' in
   the design process, while in fact they are collaborators' from the
   perspective of the whole system that moves mass over the surface of the
   earth. Constructal law predicts that the characteristic size of the
   organ shifts toward lower thermodynamic imperfection and smaller sizes.
   In time, complexity increases predictably as larger numbers of
   high-density heat flux components become interconnected in finite-size
   constructs. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Here we see why humans unwittingly build fires that look the same:
   edifices of fuel, as tall as they are wide. The pile of fuel is
   permeable, air invades it by natural convection and drives the
   combustion. I show that the hottest pile of burning fuel occurs when the
   height of the pile is roughly the same as its base diameter. Future
   studies may address the shape effect of wind, material type, and
   packing. Key is why humans of all eras have been relying on this design
   of fire ``unwittingly{''}. The reason is that the heat flow from fire
   facilitates the movement and spreading of human mass on the globe.}},

Abstract = {{The cerebral vascular network has evolved in such a way so as to
   minimize transport time and energy expenditure. This is accomplished by
   a subtle combination of the optimal arrangement of arteries, arterioles
   and capillaries and the transport mechanisms of convection and
   diffusion. Elucidating the interaction between cerebral vascular
   architectonics and the latter physical mechanisms can catalyse progress
   in treating cerebral pathologies such as stroke, brain tumours, dementia
   and targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that brain microvascular
   organization is predicated on commensurate intracapillary oxygen
   convection and parenchymal diffusion times. Cross-species grey matter
   results for the rat, cat, rabbit and human reveal very good correlation
   between the cerebral capillary and tissue mean axial oxygen convective
   and diffusion time intervals. These findings agree with the constructal
   principle.}},

   using the recently developed fully ab initio pseudohybrid Hubbard
   density functional ACBN0. We find that both the electronic and
   vibrational properties of these wide band-gap semiconductors are
   systematically improved over the PBE values and reproduce closely the
   experimental measurements. Similar accuracy is found for the structural
   parameters, especially the bulk modulus. ACBN0 results compare well with
   hybrid functional calculations at a fraction of the computational cost.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The E2F1 transcription factor regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis
   through the control of a considerable variety of target genes. Previous
   work has detailed the role of other transcription factors in mediating
   the specificity of E2F function. Here we identify the NF-YB
   transcription factor as a novel direct E2F1 target. Genome-wide
   expression analysis of the effects of NFYB knockdown on E2F1-mediated
   transcription identified a large group of genes that are co-regulated by
   E2F1 and NFYB. We also provide evidence that knockdown of NFYB enhances
   E2F1-induced apoptosis, suggesting a pro-survival function of the
   NFYB/E2F1 joint transcriptional program. Bioinformatic analysis suggests
   that deregulation of these NFY-dependent E2F1 target genes might play a
   role in sarcomagenesis as well as drug resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Noncovalently cross-linked networks are attractive hydrogel platforms
   because of their facile fabrication, dynamic behavior, and
   biocompatibility. The majority of noncovalently cross-linked hydrogels,
   however, exhibits poor mechanical properties, which significantly limit
   their utility in load bearing applications. To address this limitation,
   hydrogels are presented composed of micelles created from genetically
   engineered, amphiphilic, elastin-like polypeptides that contain a
   relatively large hydrophobic block and a hydrophilic terminus that can
   be cross-linked through metal ion coordination. To create the hydrogels,
   heat is firstly used to trigger the self-assembly of the polypeptides
   into monodisperse micelles that display transition metal coordination
   motifs on their coronae, and subsequently cross-link the micelles by
   adding zinc ions. These hydrogels exhibit hierarchical structure, are
   stable over a large temperature range, and exhibit tunable stiffness,
   self-healing, and fatigue resistance. Gels with polypeptide
   concentration of 10\%, w/v, and higher show storage moduli of
   approximate to 1 MPa from frequency sweep tests and exhibit self-healing
   within minutes. These reversibly cross-linked, hierarchical hydrogels
   with enhanced mechanical properties have potential utility in a variety
   of biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Zaki's Reef is located in the Gulf of Suez, a narrow portion of the Red
   Sea, with exceptionally dry and hot climate and lacks almost all
   scientific data. This research intends to describe the area's unique
   climatology, which may reveal correlations between the reef's existence
   at high latitude and extreme climate conditions. Air temperature at
   Zaki's Reef fluctuated between 0.3 and 58.6 degrees C with a daily range
   of 25 degrees C and annual mean of 22.1 degrees C perpendicular to
   0.075. Spectral analysis revealed half day, daily and yearly return
   periods, all of which have shown that daily and half daily cycles are
   dominating the local climate with amplitudes of approximately 5 degrees
   C. Frequency histograms revealed a bimodal signal, one peak at 14-15
   degrees C and a second peak at 32-33 degrees C, both represent nighttime
   and daytime temperatures half-day cycle. Meteorological data collected
   at Zaki's Reef were also compared to Hurghada's and Ismailia's, 400 and
   200 km south and north of the study site, respectively, to reveal any
   anomalies. Although air temperature daily means at Zaki's Reef were
   similar to Hurghada's, maximum daily means exceeded Hurghada's by 7
   degrees C, while minimums were almost equal to Ismailia's. Unexpected
   temperature trends and short distance between mountain range and Zaki's
   Reef, prompted us to hypothesize that a Foehn wind may be responsible
   for the extremely high air temperatures. Air parcel trajectory model
   results further verified that local wind patterns matched signatures of
   a Foehn wind. The observed warmer than normal air temperatures may be
   responsible for securing the survival of these northernmost subtropical
   coral reefs.}},

Title = {{Accurate Dosing of Antiretrovirals at Home Using a Foilized,
   Polyethylene Pouch to Prevent the Transmission of HIV From Mother to
   Child}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mother-to-child HIV transmission rates remain elevated in countries with
   high home birth rates. This risk can be dramatically reduced if infants
   receive antiretroviral (ARV) medication within 24 hours after birth.
   However, many barriers prevent access to these medications immediately
   after delivery, for example, there is currently no suitable mechanism to
   preserve predosed ARVs in the home during the months before birth. In
   response to this, students of the Duke University developed the Pratt
   pouch, a foilized polyethylene packet designed to preserve predosed
   ARVs.
   This cross-sectional study presents the data from the first clinical
   trials of the Pratt pouch in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
   Fourteen HIV-positive mothers and nurses were observed using the pouch
   to deliver a dose of ARVs to an infant. Weight measurements, time, and
   notes on spillage were taken at each observation period. Successful
   usage was quantitatively assessed through the calculation of dosing
   accuracy based on the volume of liquid medication emptied from the
   pouch. Additionally, mothers were surveyed after a month of using the
   device at home to assess their perception of the accuracy,
   acceptability, and ease of use of the pouch. Used pouches were collected
   for physical analysis of tearing.
   Observed users delivered accurate doses (M = 101.1\%, standard deviation
   = 8.2\%) in an average time of 2.6 minutes. A total of 2869 used pouches
   were recovered. No seal failures or failed attempts at
   opening/delivering the pouches were observed or detected. Forty-three
   mothers were surveyed. All mothers (100\%) reported that they were able
   to follow their physician's treatment plan, all pouches were received in
   good condition and the pictorial sheets provided clear instructions.
   We conclude that the Pratt pouch is a highly accurate and easy-to-use
   device for delivering liquid oral ARVs to infants and is appropriate for
   prepackaging ARVs for home use.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an optical diode by building a domain wall with
   one-dimensional waveguide array. The domain wall can be described by
   dividing the one-dimensional waveguide array into two equal parts, which
   have different refractive index, so that the waveguide array exists
   local potential. A Gaussian beam is kicked moving toward the domain wall
   and interacts with it. Transmission and reflection during the
   interaction between the Gaussian beam and the domain wall are found by
   changing related parameters. The detailed behavior of the Gaussian beam
   dynamics is analyzed numerically. Transmission of the Gaussian beam in
   one direction is much bigger than the opposite under certain
   circumstances and optical nonreciprocity is found in such a model, high
   transmission ratio of such model up to 300 is obtained. Thus the system
   can serve as an optical diode.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured carbon materials, especially activated carbon, carbon
   nanotubes, and graphene, have been widely studied for supercapacitor
   applications. To maximize the efficacy of these materials for
   electrochemical energy storage, a detailed understanding of the
   relationship between the nanostructure of these materials and their
   performance as supercapacitors is required. A fundamental structural
   parameter obtained from the Raman spectra of these materials, the
   in-plane correlation length or nanocrystalline domain size, is found to
   correlate with the electrochemical capacitance, regardless of other
   morphological features. This correlation for a common nanostructural
   characteristic is believed to be the first result of its kind to span
   several distinct nanostructured carbon morphologies, including
   graphene-carbon nanotubes hybrid materials, and may allow more effective
   nanoscale engineering of supercapacitor electrode materials.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclonic storms associated with the midlatitude Subtropical Westerly Jet
   (SWJ), referred to as Western Disturbances (WDs), play a critical role
   in the meteorology of the Indian subcontinent. WDs embedded in the
   southward propagating SWJ produce extreme precipitation over northern
   India and are further enhanced over the Himalayas due to orographic
   land-atmosphere interactions. During December, January, and February, WD
   snowfall is the dominant precipitation input to establish and sustain
   regional snowpack, replenishing regional water resources. Spring melt is
   the major source of runoff to northern Indian rivers and can be linked
   to important hydrologic processes from aquifer recharge to flashfloods.
   Understanding the dynamical structure, evolution-decay, and interaction
   of WDs with the Himalayas is therefore necessary to improve knowledge
   which has wide ranging socioeconomic implications beyond short-term
   disaster response including cold season agricultural activities,
   management of water resources, and development of vulnerability-adaptive
   measures. In addition, WD wintertime precipitation provides critical
   mass input to existing glaciers and modulates the albedo characteristics
   of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau, affecting large-scale circulation
   and the onset of the succeeding Indian Summer Monsoon. Assessing the
   impacts of climate variability and change on the Indian subcontinent
   requires fundamental understanding of the dynamics of WDs. In
   particular, projected changes in the structure of the SWJ will influence
   evolution-decay processes of the WDs and impact Himalayan regional water
   availability. This review synthesizes past research on WDs with a
   perspective to provide a comprehensive assessment of the state of
   knowledge to assist both researchers and policymakers, and context for
   future research.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies indicate that exposure of fish to pristine
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by oral gavage, causes no overt
   toxicity, and no appreciable absorption has been observed. However, in
   the environment, SWCNTs are likely to be present in dietary sources,
   which may result in differential impacts on uptake and biological
   effects. Additionally, the potential of these materials to sorb
   nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids) while present in the
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract may lead to nutrient depletion conditions
   that impact processes such as growth and reproduction. To test this
   phenomenon, fathead minnows were fed a commercial diet either with or
   without SWCNTs for 96 h. Tracking and quantification of SWCNTs using
   near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging during feeding studies showed
   the presence of food does not facilitate transport of SWCNTs across the
   intestinal epithelia. Targeting genes shown to be responsive to nutrient
   depletion (peptide transporters, peptide hormones, and lipases)
   indicated that pept2, a peptide transporter, and cck, a peptide hormone,
   showed differential mRNA expression by 96 h, a response that may be
   indicative of nutrient limitation. The results of the current study
   increase our understanding of the movement of SWCNTs through the GI
   tract, while the changes in nutrient processing genes highlight a novel
   mechanism of sublethal toxicity in aquatic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Gels are one of the soft material platforms being evaluated to deliver
   topically acting anti-HIV drugs (microbicides) to the vaginal
   environment. For each drug, its loaded concentration, gel properties and
   applied volume, and frequency of dosing can be designed to optimize PK
   and, thence, PD. These factors also impact user sensory perceptions and
   acceptability. Deterministic compartmental modeling of vaginal
   deployment and drug delivery achieved by test gels can help delineate
   how multiple parameters characterizing drug, vehicle, vaginal
   environment, and dosing govern details of PK and PD and also gel leakage
   from the canal. Such microbicide delivery is a transport process
   combining convection, e. g., from gel spreading along the vaginal canal,
   with drug diffusion in multiple compartments, including gel, mucosal
   epithelium, and stroma. The present work builds upon prior models of gel
   coating flows and drug diffusion (without convection) in the vaginal
   environment. It combines and extends these initial approaches in several
   key ways, including: (1) linking convective drug transport due to gel
   spreading with drug diffusion and (2) accounting for natural variations
   in dimensions of the canal and the site of gel placement therein.
   Results are obtained for a leading microbicide drug, tenofovir,
   delivered by three prototype microbicide gels, with a range of
   rheological properties. Themodel includes phosphorylation of tenofovir
   to tenofovir diphosphate (which manifests reverse transcriptase activity
   in host cells), the stromal concentration distributions of which are
   related to reference prophylactic values against HIV. This yields a
   computed summary measure related to gel protection ({''}percent
   protected{''}). Analyses illustrate tradeoffs amongst gel properties,
   drug loading, volume and site of placement, and vaginal dimensions, in
   the time and space history of gel distribution and tenofovir transport
   to sites of its anti-HIVaction and concentrations and potential
   prophylactic actions of tenofovir diphosphate therein.}},

Abstract = {{Process together with runtime variations in temperature and voltage, as
   well as transistor aging, degrade path delay and may eventually induce
   circuit failure due to timing variations. Therefore, in-field tracking
   of path delays is essential, and to respond to this need, several delay
   sensor designs have been proposed in the literature. However, due to the
   significant overhead of these sensors and the large number of critical
   paths in today's IC, it is infeasible to monitor the delay of every
   critical path in silicon. We present an aging-and variationaware
   representative path selection technique based on machine learning that
   allows to measure the delay of a small set of paths and infer the delay
   of a larger pool of paths that are likely to fail due to delay
   variations. Simulation results for benchmark circuits highlight the
   accuracy of the proposed approach for predicting critical-path delay
   based on the selected representative paths.}},

Title = {{Layout-Aware Mixture Preparation of Biochemical Fluids on
   Application-Specific Digital Microfluidic Biochips}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The recent proliferation of digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips has
   enabled rapid on-chip implementation of many biochemical laboratory
   assays or protocols. Sample preprocessing, which includes dilution and
   mixing of reagents, plays an important role in the preparation of
   assays. The automation of sample preparation on a digital microfluidic
   platform often mandates the execution of a mixing algorithm, which
   determines a sequence of droplet mix-split steps (usually represented as
   a mixing graph). However, the overall cost and performance of on-chip
   mixture preparation not only depends on the mixing graph but also on the
   resource allocation and scheduling strategy, for instance, the placement
   of boundary reservoirs or dispensers, mixer modules, storage units, and
   physical design of droplet-routing pathways. In this article, we first
   present a new mixing algorithm based on a number-partitioning technique
   that determines a layout-aware mixing tree corresponding to a given
   target ratio of a number of fluids. The mixing graph produced by the
   proposed method can be implemented on a chip with a fewer number of
   crossovers among droplet-routing paths as well as with a reduced
   reservoir-to-mixer transportation distance. Second, we propose a
   routing-aware resource-allocation scheme that can be used to improve the
   performance of a given mixing algorithm on a chip layout. The design
   methodology is evaluated on various test cases to demonstrate its
   effectiveness in mixture preparation with the help of two representative
   mixing algorithms. Simulation results show that on average, the proposed
   scheme can reduce the number of crossovers among droplet-routing paths
   by 89.7\% when used in conjunction with the new mixing algorithm, and by
   75.4\% when an earlier algorithm {[}Thies et al. 2008] is used.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity of cell populations can confound population-averaged
   measurements and obscure important findings or foster inaccurate
   conclusions. The ability to generate a homogeneous cell population, at
   least with respect to a chosen trait, could significantly aid basic
   biological research and development of high-throughput assays.
   Accordingly, we developed a high-resolution, image-based patterning
   strategy to produce arrays of single-cell patterns derived from the
   morphology or adhesion site arrangement of user-chosen cells of interest
   (COIs). Cells cultured on both cell-derived patterns displayed a
   cellular architecture defined by their morphology, adhesive state,
   cytoskeletal organization, and nuclear properties that quantitatively
   recapitulated the COls that defined the patterns. Furthermore, slight
   modifications to pattern design allowed for suppression of specific
   actin stress fibers and direct modulation of adhesion site dynamics.
   This approach to patterning provides a strategy to produce a more
   homogeneous cell population, decouple the influences of cytoskeletal
   structure, adhesion dynamics, and intracellular tension on
   nnechanotransduction-mediated processes, and a platform for
   high-throughput cellular assays.}},

   comparing the properties of microscopic objects, especially cells, we
   show here that quantitative comparisons of optical phase can be
   influenced by the focal plane of the measurement. Although holographic
   images can be refocused digitally using Fresnel propagation, ambiguity
   can result if this aspect is not carefully controlled. We demonstrate
   that microscopic objects can be accurately profiled by employing a

Abstract = {{A new discontinuous Galerkin spectral element time-domain (DG-SETD)
   method for Maxwell's equations based on the field variables E and B is
   proposed to analyze three-dimensional (3-D) transient electromagnetic

   variables E and H (the EH scheme), in which different orders of
   interpolation polynomials for electric and magnetic field intensities
   are required, the newly proposed method can eliminate spurious modes
   using basis functions with the same order interpolation for electric
   field intensity and magnetic flux density (the EB scheme). Consequently,
   it can reduce the number of unknowns and computation load. Domain
   decomposition for the EB scheme SETD method is completed via the DG
   method. In addition, the EB scheme SETD method is extended to the
   well-posed time-domain perfectly matched layer (PML) to truncate the
   computation domain when solving open-region problems. The effectiveness
   and advantages of the new DG-SETD method are validated by eigenvalue

Abstract = {{Genetic reprogramming holds great potential for disease modeling, drug

   cells is typically achieved by forced expression of natural
   transcription factors that control master gene networks and cell lineage
   specification. However, in many instances, the natural transcription
   factors do not induce a sufficiently robust response to completely
   reprogram cell phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that protein
   engineering of the master transcription factor MyoD can enhance the
   conversion of human dermal fibroblasts and adult stem cells to a
   skeletal myocyte phenotype. Fusion of potent transcriptional activation
   domains to MyoD led to increased myogenic gene expression, myofiber
   formation, cell fusion, and global reprogramming of the myogenic gene
   network. This work supports a general strategy for synthetically
   enhancing the direct conversion between cell types that can be applied

Abstract = {{Large areas in the tropics and at mid-latitudes experience pronounced
   seasonality and inter-annual variability in rainfall and hence water
   availability. Despite the importance of these seasonally dry ecosystems
   (SDEs) for the global carbon cycling and in providing ecosystem
   services, a unifying ecohydrological framework to interpret the effects
   of climatic variability on SDEs is still lacking. A synthesis of
   existing data about plant functional adaptations in SDEs, covering some
   400 species, shows that leaf phenological variations, rather than
   physiological traits, provide the dominant control on plant-water-carbon
   interactions. Motivated by this result, the combined implications of
   leaf phenology and climatic variability on plant water use strategies
   are here explored with a minimalist model of the coupled soil water and
   plant carbon balances. The analyses are extended to five locations with
   different hydroclimatic forcing, spanning seasonally dry tropical
   climates (without temperature seasonality) and Mediterranean climates
   (exhibiting out of phase seasonal patterns of rainfall and temperature).
   The most beneficial leaf phenology in terms of carbon uptake depends on
   the climatic regime: evergreen species are favoured by short dry seasons
   or access to persistent water stores, whereas high inter-annual
   variability of rainy season duration favours the coexistence of multiple
   drought-deciduous phenological strategies. We conclude that
   drought-deciduousness may provide a competitive advantage in face of
   predicted declines in rainfall totals, while reduced seasonality and
   access to deep water stores may favour evergreen species. This article
   has been contributed to by US Government employees and their work is in

Abstract = {{Dropwise condensation can be enhanced by superhydrophobic surfaces on
   which the condensate drops spontaneously jump upon coalescence. However,
   the self-propelled jumping in prior reports is mostly perpendicular to
   the substrate. Here, we propose a substrate design with regularly spaced
   micropillars. Coalescence on the sidewalls of the micropillars leads to
   self-propelled jumping in a direction nearly orthogonal to the pillars
   and therefore parallel to the substrate. This in-plane motion in turn
   produces sweeping removal of multiple neighboring drops. The spontaneous
   sweeping mechanism may greatly enhance dropwise condensation in a
   self-sustained manner. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Financial fraud detection using vocal, linguistic and financial cues}},
Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{78-87}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Corporate financial fraud has a severe negative impact on investors and
   the capital market in general. The current resources committed to
   financial fraud detection (FFD), however, are insufficient to identify
   all occurrences in a timely fashion. Methods for automating FFD have
   mainly relied on financial statistics, although some recent research has
   suggested that linguistic or vocal cues may also be useful indicators of
   deception. Tools based on financial numbers, linguistic behavior, and
   non-verbal vocal cues have each demonstrated the potential for detecting
   financial fraud. However, the performance of these tools continues to be
   poorer than desired, limiting their use on a stand-alone basis to help
   identify companies for further investigation. The hypothesis
   investigated in this study is that an improved tool could be developed
   if specific attributes from these feature categories were analyzed
   concurrently. Combining features across categories provided better fraud
   detection than was achieved by any of the feature categories alone.
   However, performance improvements were only observed if feature
   selection was used suggesting that it is important to discard
   non-informative features. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel general-purpose compression method for tomographic

   (3D-ASRC). In this paper, we focus on applications of 3D-ASRC for the
   compression of ophthalmic 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.
   The 3D-ASRC algorithm exploits correlations among adjacent OCT images to
   improve compression performance, yet is sensitive to preserving their
   differences. Due to the inherent denoising mechanism of the sparsity
   based 3D-ASRC, the quality of the compressed images are often better
   than the raw images they are based on. Experiments on clinical-grade
   retinal OCT images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed 3D-ASRC
   over other well-known compression methods.}},

Abstract = {{Power Doppler imaging is a widely used method of flow detection for
   tissue perfusion monitoring, inflammatory hyperemia detection, deep vein
   thrombosis diagnosis, and other clinical applications. However, thermal
   noise and clutter limit its sensitivity and ability to detect slow flow.
   In addition, large ensembles are required to obtain sufficient
   sensitivity, which limits frame rate and yields flash artifacts during
   moderate tissue motion. We propose an alternative method of flow
   detection using the spatial coherence of backscattered ultrasound
   echoes. The method enhances slow flow detection and frame rate, while
   maintaining or improving the signal quality of conventional power
   Doppler techniques. The feasibility of this method is demonstrated with
   simulations, flow-phantom experiments, and an in vivo human thyroid
   study. In comparison with conventional power Doppler imaging, the
   proposed method can produce Doppler images with 15- to 30-dB SNR
   improvement. Therefore, the method is able to detect flow with
   velocities approximately 50\% lower than conventional power Doppler, or
   improve the frame rate by a factor of 3 with comparable image quality.
   The results show promise for clinical applications of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Extraordinary enhancement of second harmonic generation is engineered in
   a three-dimensional air-bridge photonic crystal slab with a
   multiple-layer dielectric structure by the spectral element method. By
   exploiting the symmetry of the multiple-layer system, the large matrix
   equation arising in the spectral element method can be solved by using
   the block Thomas algorithm to significantly improve the efficiency of
   the solver. A 63-layer structure with a total thickness less than 8 mu m
   is designed to achieve large enhancement of the second harmonic
   generation effect by almost 10 orders of magnitude, with an output
   second harmonic field power rate of more than 0.1\% under a typical
   laser incident field of 0.5 MV/m. In addition, the sensitivity of the
   transmittance to the thickness of each layer is investigated. The
   sensitivity result shows that at the resonant frequency with large
   second harmonic generation, the sensitivity to the thickness is large,
   so the thickness precision is important to obtain large enhancement for
   the second harmonic generation. The application of this system to highly
   monochromatic light sources is discussed. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Between 1564 and 1810, nearly 17,000 metric tons of mercury (Hg) vapor
   was released to the environment during cinnabar refining in the small
   town of Huancavelica, Peru. The present study characterizes individual
   exposure to mercury using total and speciated Hg from residential
   samples, total Hg in hair, and self-reported questionnaire data
   regarding factors influencing exposure (e.g., frequency of fish
   consumption, occupation). Total Hg concentrations in hair from 118
   participants ranged from 0.10 to 3.6 A mu g/g, similar to concentrations
   found in the USA and lower than concentrations in other Hg-exposed
   populations around the world. Pearson's correlation coefficients for
   data in this study suggest that there is a positive correlation between
   concentrations of total Hg in hair and concentrations of total Hg in
   adobe bricks, dirt floors, and surface dust; however, these correlations
   are not statistically significant. Results of a one-way analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) identified that total Hg concentrations in hair were
   significantly related to gender (p < 0.001), living in a neighborhood
   where smelters were previously located (p = 0.021), smoking status (p =
   0.003), frequency of house cleaning (p = 0.019), and frequency of fish
   consumption (p = 0.046). These results highlight the need for further
   studies to better characterize Hg exposure in Huancavelica, particularly
   as related to residential contamination. A comprehensive analysis of
   residential Hg contamination and exposure in Huancavelica will guide the
   development and implementation of mitigation and remediation strategies
   in the community to reduce potential health risks from residential Hg
   exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Reasoning-based functional-fault diagnosis has recently been advocated
   to achieve high diagnosis accuracy, low defect escapes, and reducing
   manufacturing cost. However, such diagnosis method requires a rich set
   of test items (syndromes) and a sizable database of faulty boards to
   learn from. An insufficient number of failed boards, ambiguous
   root-cause identification, and redundant or irrelevant syndromes can
   render reasoning-based diagnosis ineffective. Periodic evaluation and
   analysis can help locate weaknesses in a diagnosis system and thereby
   provide guidelines for redesigning the tests, which facilitates better
   diagnosis. We propose an information-theoretic framework for evaluating
   the effectiveness of and providing guidance to a reasoning-based
   functional-fault diagnosis system. Syndrome analysis based on feature
   selection methods provides a representative set of syndromes and
   suggests irrelevant syndromes in diagnosis. Root-cause analysis measures
   the discriminative ability of differentiating a given root cause from
   others. Results are presented for four types of diagnosis systems for
   three complex boards that are in volume production.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional treatment for cancer routinely includes surgical resection
   and some combination of chemotherapy and radiation. These approaches are
   frequently accompanied by unintended and highly toxic collateral damage
   to healthy tissues, which are offset by only marginal prognostic
   improvements in patients with advanced cancers. This unfortunate balance
   has driven the development of novel therapies that aim to target tumors
   both safely and efficiently. Over the past decade, mounting evidence has
   supported the therapeutic utility of T-cell-centered cancer
   immunotherapy, which, in its various iterations, has been shown capable
   of eliciting highly precise and robust antitumor responses both in
   animal models and human trials. The identification of tumor-specific
   targets has further fueled a growing interest in T-cell therapies given
   their potential to circumvent the non-specific nature of traditional
   treatments. Of the several strategies geared toward achieving T-cell
   recognition of tumor, bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) represent a novel
   class of biologics that have garnered enthusiasm in recent years due to
   their versatility, specificity, safety, cost, and ease of production.
   Bispecific T-cell Engagers (BiTEs) are a subclass of bsAbs that are
   specific for CD3 on one arm and a tumor antigen on the second. As such,
   BiTEs function by recruiting and activating polyclonal populations of
   T-cells at tumor sites, and do so without the need for co-stimulation or
   conventional MHC recognition. Blinatumomab, a well-characterized BiTE,
   has emerged as a promising recombinant bscCD19xCD3 construct that has
   demonstrated remarkable antitumor activity in patients with B-cell
   malignancies. This clinical success has resulted in the rapid extension
   of BiTE technology against a greater repertoire of tumor antigens and
   the recent US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) accelerated approval
   of blinatumomab for the treatment of a rare form of acute lymphoblastic
   leukemia (ALL). In this review, we dissect the role of T-cell
   therapeutics in the new era of cancer immunotherapy, appraise the value
   of CAR T-cells in the context of solid tumors, and discuss why the BiTE
   platform may rescue several of the apparent deficits and shortcomings of
   competing immunotherapies to support its widespread clinical
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Two new indicators of rainfall seasonality based on information entropy,
   the relative entropy (RE) and the dimensionless seasonality index (DSI),
   together with the mean annual rainfall, are evaluated on a global scale
   for recently updated precipitation gridded datasets and for historical
   simulations from coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models.
   The RE provides a measure of the number of wet months and, for
   precipitation regimes featuring a distinct wet and dry season, it is
   directly related to the duration of the wet season. The DSI combines the
   rainfall intensity with its degree of seasonality and it is an indicator
   of the extent of the global monsoon region. We show that the RE and the
   DSI are fairly independent of the time resolution of the precipitation
   data, thereby allowing objective metrics for model intercomparison and
   ranking. Regions with different precipitation regimes are classified and
   characterized in terms of RE and DSI. Comparison of different land
   observational datasets reveals substantial difference in their local
   representation of seasonality. It is shown that two-dimensional maps of
   RE provide an easy way to compare rainfall seasonality from various
   datasets and to determine areas of interest. Models participating to the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project platform, Phase 5, consistently
   overestimate the RE over tropical Latin America and underestimate it in
   West Africa, western Mexico and East Asia. It is demonstrated that
   positive RE biases in a general circulation model are associated with
   excessively peaked monthly precipitation fractions, too large during the
   wet months and too small in the months preceding and following the wet
   season; negative biases are instead due, in most cases, to an excess of
   rainfall during the premonsoonal months.}},

Abstract = {{We develop in this paper a theoretical framework for the topological
   study of time series data. Broadly speaking, we describe geometrical and
   topological properties of sliding window embeddings, as seen through the
   lens of persistent homology. In particular, we show that maximum
   persistence at the point-cloud level can be used to quantify periodicity
   at the signal level, prove structural and convergence theorems for the
   resulting persistence diagrams, and derive estimates for their
   dependency on window size and embedding dimension. We apply this
   methodology to quantifying periodicity in synthetic data sets and
   compare the results with those obtained using state-of-the-art methods
   in gene expression analysis. We call this new method SW1PerS, which
   stands for Sliding Windows and 1-Dimensional Persistence Scoring.}},

Abstract = {{High-velocity streams of high-dimensional data pose significant ``big
   data{''} analysis challenges across a range of applications and
   settings. Online learning and online convex programming play a
   significant role in the rapid recovery of important or anomalous
   information from these large datastreams. While recent advances in
   online learning have led to novel and rapidly converging algorithms,
   these methods are unable to adapt to nonstationary environments arising
   in real-world problems. This paper describes a dynamic mirror descent
   framework which addresses this challenge, yielding low theoretical
   regret bounds and accurate, adaptive, and computationally efficient
   algorithms which are applicable to broad classes of problems. The
   methods are capable of learning and adapting to an underlying and
   possibly time-varying dynamical model. Empirical results in the context
   of dynamic texture analysis, solar flare detection, sequential
   compressed sensing of a dynamic scene, traffic surveillance, tracking
   self-exciting point processes and network behavior in the Enron email
   corpus support the core theoretical findings.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple kernel learning (MKL) and classifier ensemble are two
   mainstream methods for solving learning problems in which some sets of
   features/views are more informative than others, or the features/views
   within a given set are inconsistent. In this paper, we first present a
   novel probabilistic interpretation of MKL such that maximum entropy
   discrimination with a noninformative prior over multiple views is
   equivalent to the formulation of MKL. Instead of using the
   noninformative prior, we introduce a novel data-dependent prior based on
   an ensemble of kernel predictors, which enhances the prediction
   performance of MKL by leveraging the merits of the classifier ensemble.
   With the proposed probabilistic framework of MKL, we propose a
   hierarchical Bayesian model to learn the proposed data-dependent prior
   and classification model simultaneously. The resultant problem is convex
   and other information (e.g., instances with either missing views or
   missing labels) can be seamlessly incorporated into the data-dependent
   priors. Furthermore, a variety of existing MKL models can be recovered
   under the proposed MKL framework and can be readily extended to
   incorporate these priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits
   of our proposed framework in supervised and semisupervised settings, as
   well as in tasks with partial correspondence among multiple views.}},

Abstract = {{Pro-osteogenic stimulation of bone cells by bioactive ceramic-coated
   orthopedic implants is influenced by both surface roughness and material
   chemistry; however, their concomitant impact on osteoblast behavior is
   not well understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects
   of nano-scale roughness and chemistry of bioactive silica-calcium
   phosphate nanocomposite (SCPC50) coated Ti-6Al-4V on modulating early
   bone cell responses. Cell attachment was higher on SCPC50-coated
   substrates compared to the uncoated controls; however, cells on the
   uncoated substrate exhibited greater spreading and superior quality of
   F-actin filaments than cells on the SCPC50-coated substrates. The poor
   F-actin filament organization on SCPC50-coated substrates is thought to
   be due to the enhanced calcium uptake by the ceramic surface.
   Dissolution analyses showed that an increase in surface roughness was
   accompanied by increased calcium uptake, and increased phosphorous and
   silicon release, all of which appear to interfere with F-actin assembly
   and osteoblast morphology. Moreover, cell attachment onto the
   SCPC50-coated substrates correlated with the known adsorption of
   fibronectin, and was independent of surface roughness. High-throughput
   genome sequencing showed enhanced expression of extracellular matrix and
   cell differentiation related genes. These results demonstrate a
   synergistic relationship between bioactive ceramic coating roughness and
   material chemistry resulting in a phenotype that leads to early
   osteoblast differentiation. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{Background: To apply automated spectral domain optical coherence
   tomography (SD-OCT) segmentation to eyes with resolving papilledema.
   Methods: Ninety-four patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension
   seen at the Duke Eye Center neuro-ophthalmology clinic between November
   2010 and October 2011 were reviewed. Excluded were eyes with papilledema
   with Frisen grade >2, other optic neuropathies or retinopathies, and
   those that did not have SD-OCT imaging. The remaining 43 patients were
   split into 2 groups: non-atrophic papilledema and atrophic papilledema.
   Automated SD-OCT segmentation was performed on patients with
   non-atrophic papilledema and age-matched controls for each of the 9
   regions of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study map.
   Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. All SD-OCT
   scans were reviewed for retinal structural abnormalities.
   Results: Total macular thickness was significantly thinner within the
   fovea and inner macular ring in non-atrophic papilledema vs control eyes
   (266 vs 276 mu m, P = 0.04; 333 vs 344 mm P < 0.01, n = 26 non-atrophic
   papilledema, 30 controls). SD-OCT demonstrated thinning within the
   fovea, inner macular ring, and outer macular ring of the outer plexiform
   layer plus nuclear layer in non-atrophic papilledema vs control (124 vs
   131 mm, P, 0.01; 112 vs 118 mm, P = 0.03; 95 vs 100 mm, P = 0.03).
   Retinal structural changes were seen in 21/33 eyes with atrophic
   papilledema vs none of the eyes with non-atrophic papilledema or
   controls.
   Conclusions: SD-OCT shows qualitative and quantitative changes in the
   macula of eyes with resolved papilledema.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2394-2410}},

Abstract = {{Cospectral budgets are used to link the kinetic and potential energy
   distributions of turbulent eddies, as measured by their spectra, to
   macroscopic relations between the turbulent Prandtl number (Pr-t) and
   atmospheric stability measures such as the stability parameter zeta, the
   gradient Richardson number R-g, or the flux Richardson number R-f in the
   atmospheric surface layer. The dependence of Pr-t on zeta, R-g, or R-f
   is shown to be primarily controlled by the ratio of Kolmogorov and
   Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin phenomenological constants and a constant
   associated with isotropization of turbulent flux production that can be
   independently determined using rapid distortion theory in homogeneous
   turbulence. Changes in scaling laws of the vertical velocity and air
   temperature spectra are also shown to affect the Pr-t-zeta (or Pr-t-R-g
   or Pr-t-R-f) relation. Results suggest that departure of Pr-t from unity
   under neutral conditions is induced by dissimilarity between momentum
   and heat in terms of Rotta constants, isotropization constants, and
   constants in the flux transfer terms. A maximum flux Richardson number
   R-fm predicted from the cospectral budgets method (=0.25) is in good
   agreement with values in the literature, suggesting that R-fm may be
   tied to the collapse of Kolmogorov spectra instead of laminarization of
   turbulent flows under stable stratification. The linkages between
   microscale energy distributions of turbulent eddies and macroscopic
   relations that are principally determined by dimensional considerations
   or similarity theories suggest that when these scalewise energy
   distributions of eddies experience a ``transition{''} to other
   distributions (e.g., when R-f is increased over R-fm), dimensional
   considerations or similarity theories may fail to predict bulk flow
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have suggested that elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure

   device for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring would have
   a significant impact on clinical care. A proof-of-concept prototype is
   used to test the feasibility of a technique for monitoring ICP changes.
   The proposed methodology utilizes transcranial Doppler ultrasonography
   to monitor blood flow through the ophthalmic and central retinal
   arteries while forces are applied to the cornea by a controlled
   actuator. Control algorithms for the device were developed and tested
   using an integrated experimental platform. Preliminary results using
   tissue-mimicking materials show the ability to differentiate between
   materials of differing stiffness that simulates different levels of ICP.
   These experiments are an initial step toward a handheld noninvasive ICP

Abstract = {{Tendons mainly function as load-bearing tissues in the muscloskeletal
   system; transmitting loads from muscle to bone. Tendons are dynamic
   structures that respond to the magnitude, direction, frequency, and
   duration of physiologic as well as pathologic mechanical loads via
   complex interactions between cellular pathways and the highly
   specialized extracellular matrix. This paper reviews the evolution and
   current knowledge of mechanobiology in tendon development, homeostasis,
   disease, and repair. In addition, we review several novel
   mechanotransduction pathways that have been identified recently in other
   tissues and cell types, providing potential research opportunities in
   the field of tendon mechanobiology. We also highlight current methods,
   models, and technologies being used in a wide variety of mechanobiology
   research that could be investigated in the context of their potential
   applicability for answering some of the fundamental unanswered questions
   in this field. The article concludes with a review of the major
   questions and future goals discussed during the recent ORS/ISMMS New
   Frontiers in Tendon Research Conference held on September 10 and 11,
   2014 in New York City. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Here, I review the physics meaning of optimization, knowledge and design
   evolution, and why these concepts and human activities are profoundly
   useful for human life. A law of physics is a concise statement that
   summarizes a phenomenon that occurs in nature. A phenomenon is a fact,
   circumstance, or experience that is apparent to the human senses and can
   be described. The design in nature phenomenon facilitates access for
   everything that flows, evolves, spreads, and is collected: river basins,
   atmospheric and ocean currents, animal life and migration, and
   technology (the evolution of the ``human-andmachine species,{''} wealth,
   life). This phenomenon is summarized by the constructal law: the
   occurrence and evolution of designs in nature, its time direction. Based
   on its record, the constructal law accounts for the design phenomenon
   and also for all the phenomena that have been described individually
   (ad-hoc) with end-design (destiny) statements of ``optimality{''} (min,
   max). Most notably, the constructal law accounts for contradictory
   end-design statements such as minimum entropy production and maximum
   entropy production, and minimum flow resistance and maximum flow
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sampling (CoSa) is a new methodology which demonstrates that
   sparse signals can be recovered from a small number of linear
   measurements. Greedy algorithms like CoSaMP have been designed for this
   recovery, and variants of these methods have been adapted to the case
   where sparsity is with respect to some arbitrary dictionary rather than
   an orthonormal basis. In this work we present an analysis of the
   so-called Signal Space CoSaMP method when the measurements are corrupted
   with mean-zero white Gaussian noise. We establish near-oracle
   performance for recovery of signals sparse in some arbitrary dictionary.
   In addition, we analyze the block variant of the method for signals
   whose supports obey a block structure, extending the method into the
   model-based compressed sensing framework. Numerical experiments confirm
   that the block method significantly outperforms the standard method in
   these settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Finding the stable structures of N1-xWx with an ab initio
   high-throughput approach}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Using density functional theory calculations, many researchers have
   predicted that various tungsten nitride compounds N1-xWx (x < 1/2) will
   be ``ultraincompressible{''} or ``superhard,{''} i.e., as hard as or
   harder than diamond. Necessary conditions for such compounds are that
   they have large bulk and shear moduli, greater than approximately 200
   GPa, and are elastically and vibrationally stable. Compounds with such
   desirable properties also must be energetically stable against
   decomposition into other compounds. This test for stability can only be
   found after the determination of the convex hull for N1-xWx, which
   connects the lowest enthalpy structures as a function of composition.
   Unfortunately, the experimental phase diagram of the N-W structure is
   uncertain, as it is difficult to break the N-2 bond to form compounds
   with tungsten. Experiment also indicates that there are a large number
   of partially filled sites in most N-W structures. This introduces
   computational difficulties since we cannot easily model randomly placed
   vacancies. In addition, van der Waals forces play a significant role in
   determining the structure of solid N-2 and the nitrogen-rich compounds.
   This makes it difficult to determine the relative energies of these
   compounds, as there is no universally accepted density functional
   incorporating van der Waals interactions. The exact shape and even
   composition of the convex hull is dependent upon the choice of density
   functional, even if we only chose between the local density
   approximation and a generalized gradient functional. Despite these
   difficulties, computations can determine much about the ground-state
   form of the convex hull. Here, we use high-throughput calculations to
   map out the hull and other low-energy structures for the N-W system. The
   lowest-energy structures all have vacancies, on the tungsten sites in
   hexagonal-based compounds, and on both the nitrogen and tungsten sites
   in cubic compounds. We find that most of the N-W structures proposed in
   the literature, both theoretical and experimental, are above the convex
   hull, in some cases by over 0.2 eV/atom. One of the ground-state phases,
   N-W in the NbO structure, has relatively large bulk (>300 GPa) and (>200
   GPa) shear moduli, and so is a candidate superhard material. This will
   require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, several functional extensions of optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) have emerged, and this review highlights key advances
   in instrumentation, theoretical analysis, signal processing and clinical
   application of these extensions. We review five principal extensions:
   Doppler OCT (DOCT), polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), optical
   coherence elastography (OCE), spectroscopic OCT (SOCT), and molecular
   imaging OCT. The former three have been further developed with studies
   in both ex vivo and in vivo human tissues. This review emphasizes the
   newer techniques of SOCT and molecular imaging OCT, which show excellent
   potential for clinical application but have yet to be well reviewed in
   the literature. SOCT elucidates tissue characteristics, such as
   oxygenation and carcinogenesis, by detecting wavelength-dependent
   absorption and scattering of light in tissues. While SOCT measures
   endogenous biochemical distributions, molecular imaging OCT detects
   exogenous molecular contrast agents. These newer advances in functional
   OCT broaden the potential clinical application of OCT by providing novel
   ways to understand tissue activity that cannot be accomplished by other
   current imaging methodologies.}},

   Solar Cells}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{The effort to develop earth-abundant kesterite solar cells has led to an
   approximate doubling of the power conversion efficiency over the past
   five years to 12.6\%, primarily due to increases in short-circuit
   current and fill factor; open-circuit voltage has resisted similar
   change, limiting further efficiency improvement. In the present
   investigation, Auger nanoprobe spectroscopy, X-ray/ultraviolet
   photoelectron spectroscopy, and device characterization are used to
   provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of grain boundaries
   and interfaces in limiting performance in kesterite-based devices. High
   photovoltaic performance is found to correlate with grain boundaries
   that are Cu-depleted and enriched with SnOx. The formation of this
   bulk-like oxide at grain boundaries with type I band offset provides a
   unique effective passivation that limits electron-hole recombination.
   Building on these new insights, photovoltaic device simulations are
   performed that show optimized electrostatic designs can compensate for
   bulk defects, allowing efficiencies closer to the theoretical limit.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the utility of silk fibroin (SF) microparticles
   as sustained release vehicles for intra-articular delivery.
   Design: SF formulations were varied to generate microparticle drug
   carriers that were characterized in vitro for their physical properties,
   release kinetics for a conjugated fluorophore (Cy7), and in vivo for
   intra-articular retention time using live-animal, fluorescence in vivo
   imaging.
   Results: SF microparticle carriers were spherical in shape and ranged
   from 598 nm to 21.5 mu m in diameter. SF microparticles provided for
   sustained release of Cy7 in vitro, with only 10\% of the initial load
   released over 7 days. Upon intra-articular injection in rat knee joints,
   the SF microparticles were associated with an intra-articular
   fluorescence decay half-life of 43.3 h, greatly increasing the joint
   residence over that for an equivalent concentration of SF-Cy7 in
   solution form. The SF microparticles also increase the localization of
   dye within the joint cavity as determined by image analysis of
   fluorescent gradients, significantly reducing distribution of the Cy7 to
   neighboring tissue as compared to SF-Cy7 in free solution.
   Conclusion: Silk microparticles act to provide for localized and
   sustained delivery of loaded small molecules following intra-articular
   injection, and may be an attractive strategy for delivering small
   molecule drugs for the treatment of arthritis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Owing to their unique optical properties such as large absorption and
   scattering cross section and large enhancement of electromagnetic field
   at the surface, plasmonic nanostructures have received extensive
   attention as a highly promising class of materials for nano-oncology.
   Most of the existing plasmonic nanostructures require extensive
   post-synthesis treatments and biofunctionalization routines to mitigate
   their cytotoxicity and/or make them tumor-specific. Here, we report
   one-pot synthesis of a novel class of plasmonic nanostructures, namely,
   gold nanoraspberries (GRBs) with tunable size and localized surface
   plasmon resonance by using a naturally abundant polysaccharide,
   chitosan, which acts as a template and capping agent. Significantly, the
   GRBs, which do not require any further biofunctionalization, exhibit
   excellent selectivity to tumor cells, thus enabling locoregional therapy
   at the cellular level. We demonstrate the tumor-selectivity of GRBs by
   photothermal ablation of tumor cells selectively from their co-culture
   with normal cells. The simple, scalable and tumor-selective nature of
   GRBs makes them excellent candidates for translational plasmonics-based
   nanomedicine.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{One of the obstacles preventing wireless power transfer from becoming
   ubiquitous is their leakage of power: high-amplitude electromagnetic
   fields that can interfere with other electronic devices, increase health
   concerns, or hinder power metering. In this paper, we present near-field
   plates (NFPs) as a novel method to tailor the electromagnetic fields
   generated by a wireless power transfer system while maintaining high
   efficiency. NFPs are modulated arrays or surfaces designed to form
   prescribed near-field patterns. The NFP proposed in this paper consists
   of an array of loaded loops that are designed to confine the
   electromagnetic fields of a resonant transmitting loop to the desired
   direction (receiving loop) while suppressing fields in other directions.
   The step-by-step design procedure for this device is outlined. Two NFPs
   are designed and examined in full-wave simulation. Their performance is
   shown to be in close agreement with the design predictions, thereby
   verifying the proposed design and operation. A NFP is also fabricated
   and experimentally shown to form a unidirectional wireless power
   transfer link with high efficiency. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{We construct families of discrete solitons (DSs) in an array of
   self-defocusing waveguides with an embedded parity-time- (PT-) symmetric
   dimer, which is represented by a pair of waveguides carrying mutually
   balanced gain and loss. Four types of states attached to the embedded
   defect are found, namely, staggered and unstaggered bright localized
   modes and gray or antigray DSs. Their existence and stability regions
   expand with the increase of the strength of the coupling between the
   dimer-forming sites. The existence of the gray and staggered bright DSs
   is qualitatively explained by dint of the continuum limit. All the gray
   and antigray DSs are stable (some of them are unstable if the dimer
   carries the nonlinear PT symmetry, represented by balanced nonlinear
   gain and loss; in that case, the instability does not lead to a blowup,
   but rather creates oscillatory dynamical states). The boundary between
   the gray and antigray DSs is predicted in an approximate analytical
   form.}},

Abstract = {{We present a 3D computational imaging system based on a mode-mixing
   cavity at microwave frequencies. The core component of this system is an
   electrically large rectangular cavity with one corner re-shaped to
   catalyze mode mixing, often called a Sinai Billiard. The front side of
   the cavity is perforated with a grid of periodic apertures that sample
   the cavity modes and project them into the imaging scene. The radiated
   fields are scattered by the scene and are measured by low gain probe
   antennas. The complex radiation patterns generated by the cavity thus
   encode the scene information onto a set of frequency modes. Assuming the
   first Born approximation for scattering dynamics, the received signal is
   processed using computational methods to reconstruct a 3D image of the
   scene with resolution determined by the diffraction limit. The proposed
   mode-mixing cavity is simple to fabricate, exhibits low losses, and can
   generate highly diverse measurement modes. The imaging system
   demonstrated in this letter can find application in security screening
   and medical diagnostic imaging. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{We investigate both theoretically and experimentally the nonlinear
   propagation of surface-plasmon polaritons (SPP) on a single air/metal
   interface. Inspired by nonlinear dielectric waveguide theory, we
   analytically derive a model that describes the nonlinear propagation of
   SPPs, thus bridging the description of plasmonic and dielectric
   waveguides. The model, the numerical simulations, and the experiments,
   which are carried out in the 100 fs regime, reveal that the SPP
   undergoes strong ultrafast self-action which manifests itself through
   self-induced absorption. Our observations are consistent with a large,
   bulk, third-order nonlinear susceptibility (chi((3))) of gold and
   provide a self-consistent theory of self-action of SPPs at an air/metal
   interface. Experimentally, we find Im\{chi(-(3))\} similar to 3 x
   10(-16) m(2)/V-2. These findings have important implications in the
   nonlinear physics of plasmonics and metamaterials as they provide
   evidence that nonlinear absorption has a significant effect on the
   propagation of SPPs excited by intense optical pulses. This self-action
   is also expected to affect the anomalous absorption of light near
   subwavelength structures as well as the strength of desirable nonlinear
   processes such as third-harmonic generation and four-wave mixing, which
   will inevitably compete with nonlinear absorption.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Classical nonlocality in conducting nanostructures has been shown to
   dramatically alter the linear optical response by placing a fundamental
   limit on the maximum field enhancement that can be achieved. This limit
   directly extends to all nonlinear processes, which depend on field
   amplitudes. A numerical study of third-harmonic generation in metal
   film-coupled nanowires reveals that for subnanometer vacuum gaps, the
   nonlocality may boost the effective nonlinearity by 5 orders of
   magnitude as the field penetrates deeper inside the metal than that
   predicted assuming a purely local electronic response. We also study the
   impact of a nonlinear dielectric placed in the gap region. In this case
   the effect of nonlocality could be masked by the third-harmonic signal
   generated by the spacer. By etching the dielectric underneath the
   nanowire, however, it is possible to muffle such contributions.
   Calculations are performed for both silver and gold nanowire.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanomaterials are naturally occurring with unique structural,
   mechanical and optical properties. While the paper and packaging,
   automotive, personal care, construction, and textiles industries have
   recognized cellulose nanomaterials' potential, we suggest cellulose
   nanomaterials have great untapped potential in water treatment
   technologies. In this review, we gather evidence of cellulose
   nanomaterials' beneficial role in environmental remediation and
   membranes for water filtration, including their high surface
   area-to-volume ratio, low environmental impact, high strength,
   functionalizability, and sustainability. We make direct comparison
   between cellulose nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in terms of
   physical and chemical properties, production costs, use and disposal in
   order to show the potential of cellulose nanomaterials as a sustainable
   replacement for CNTs in water treatment technologies. Finally, we
   comment on the need for improved communication and collaboration across
   the myriad industries invested in cellulose nanomaterials production and
   development to achieve an efficient means to commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{We present an approach for implanting radio frequency transmission lines
   in biological tissue, using a single insulated wire surrounded by tissue
   as a variant of the Goubau single-wire transmission line (SWTL) in air.
   We extend the Goubau SWTL model to include SWTLs surrounded by lossy
   dielectrics such as tissue by assuming a propagating mode component in
   the tissue. We show that a thin wire of radius 63.5 mu m, coated with
   biocompatible fluorinated ethylene propylene dielectric, exhibits a
   measured loss of only 1 dB/cm at a frequency of 915 MHz. The model fit
   to the measured insertion loss is within +/- 0.3 dB/cm across the 100MHz
   to 3 GHz band. This SWTL presents excellent impedance matching to 50
   Omega as evidenced by a measured median return loss better than 10 dB
   across the 100MHz to 3 GHz range. This approach represents an
   alternative to near-field magnetic coupling for implanted systems where
   tissue displacement by a single, thin wire can be tolerated. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Numerical investigation of self-propagating reaction fronts in a network
   of Ni/Al nanolayered particles is conducted using the generalised
   reduced continuum model developed by Alawieh, Weihs and Knio
   {[}Combustion and Flame, Vol. 160, No. 9 (2013), pp. 1857-1869].
   However, due to the high dimensionality and the high computational costs
   associated with simulating such systems, a further reduction of the
   model is sought through identifying regimes under which spatial
   homogenisation at the particle level would be valid. The limiting case
   of a single chain of particles with no porosity is considered, and
   comparisons between the computational results of the heterogeneous and
   the homogeneous reduced model descriptions are carried out. These enable
   us to determine a narrow region where the homogeneous particle
   approximation is valid, based on a criterion composed of the
   non-dimensional ratio of the particle's internal thermal resistance to
   its thermal contact resistance. We demonstrate that the validity of the
   homogeneous approximation may hold even for layered particles whose size
   is almost an order of magnitude larger than the thermal width of a
   reaction front steadily propagating in a uniform foil. The computations
   also show that the velocity of the front in the particle compact
   exhibits large variations as the thermal contact resistance is varied,
   which would offer the possibility of controlling reaction speed and
   ignition properties.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{335-344}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The effects of mechanical cues on cell behaviors in 3D remain difficult
   to characterize as the ability to tune hydrogel mechanics often requires
   changes in the polymer density, potentially altering the material's
   biochemical and physical characteristics. Additionally, with most PEG
   diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels, forming materials with compressive moduli
   less than similar to 10 kPa has been virtually impossible. Here, we
   present a new method of controlling the mechanical properties of PEGDA
   hydrogels independent of polymer chain density through the incorporation
   of additional vinyl group moieties that interfere with the cross-linking
   of the network. This modification can tune hydrogel mechanics in a
   concentration dependent manner from < 1 to 17 kPa, a more
   physiologically relevant range than previously possible with PEG-based
   hydrogels, without altering the hydrogel's degradation and permeability.
   Across this range of mechanical properties, endothelial cells (ECs)
   encapsulated within MMP-2/MMP-9 degradable hydrogels with RGDS adhesive
   peptides revealed increased cell spreading as hydrogel stiffness
   decreased in contrast to behavior typically observed for cells on 2D
   surfaces. EC-pericyte cocultures exhibited vessel-like networks within 3
   days in highly compliant hydrogels as compared to a week in stiffer
   hydrogels. These vessel networks persisted for at least 4 weeks and
   deposited laminin and collagen IV perivascularly. These results indicate
   that EC morphogenesis can be regulated using mechanical cues in 3D.
   Furthermore, controlling hydrogel compliance independent of density
   allows for the attainment of highly compliant mechanical regimes in
   materials that can act as customizable cell microenvironments.}},

Abstract = {{An expression that separates biotic and abiotic controls on the temporal
   dynamics of the soil moisture spatial coefficient of variation
   C-v(theta) was explored via numerical simulations using a mechanistic
   ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. Continuous soil moisture
   spatiotemporal dynamics at an exemplary hillslope domain were computed
   for six case studies characterized by different climate and vegetation
   cover and for three configurations of soil properties. It was shown that
   abiotic controls largely exceed their biotic counterparts in wet
   climates. Biotic controls on C-v(theta) were found to be more pronounced
   in Mediterranean climates. The relation between C-v(theta) and spatial
   mean soil moisture (theta) over bar was found to be unique in wet
   locations, regardless of the soil properties. For the case of
   homogeneous soil texture, hysteretic cycles between C-v(theta) and
   (theta) over bar were observed in all Mediterranean climate locations
   considered here and to a lesser extent in a deciduous temperate forest.
   Heterogeneity in soil properties increased C-v(theta) to values
   commensurate with field observations and weakened signatures of
   hysteresis at all of the studied locations. This finding highlights the
   role of site-specific heterogeneities in hiding or even eliminating the
   signature of climatic and biotic controls on C-v(theta), thereby
   offering a new perspective on causes of confounding results reported
   across field experiments.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The age distribution of water in hydrologic systems has received renewed
   interest recently, especially in relation to watershed response to
   rainfall inputs. The purpose of this contribution is first to draw
   attention to existing theories of age distributions in population
   dynamics, fluid mechanics and stochastic groundwater, and in particular
   to the McKendrick-von Foerster equation and its generalizations and
   solutions. A second and more important goal is to clarify that, when
   hydrologic fluxes are modeled by means of time-varying stochastic
   processes, the age distributions must themselves be treated as random
   functions. Once their probabilistic structure is obtained, it can be
   used to characterize the variability of age distributions in real
   systems and thus help quantify the inherent uncertainty in the field
   determination of water age. We illustrate these concepts with reference
   to a stochastic storage model, which has been used as a minimalist model
   of soil moisture and streamflow dynamics.}},

Title = {{GO/PO and PTD With Virtual Divergence Factor for Fast Analysis of
   Scattering From Concave Complex Targets}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Due to simplicity, hybridization of geometrical optics (GO) and physical
   optics (PO) based on ray tracing has been widely used for fast
   scattering analyses. However, when targets of curved concavities are
   discretized by flat facets, the loss of divergence factor (DF) will
   degrade the simulation accuracy. To remedy this loss, a simple and
   efficient factor, entitled virtual divergence factor (VDF), is proposed
   to play the role of DF. To prove the validity of VDF and simulate the
   scattering of concave complex targets, a hybrid method of GO/PO and
   physical theory of diffraction (PTD) is elucidated. With VDF correction,
   several typical targets, including a S-shape cavity, are simulated by
   this hybrid method. In comparison to multilevel fast multipole algorithm
   (MLFMA) or measurements, the validaty of VDF is fully demonstrated by
   good agreements and the excellent performance relative to DF on
   canonical surfaces, where the great efficiency and flexibility of this
   hybrid method are also shown. Moreover, one interesting and important
   issue, the dependance of field convergence on the maximum number of ray
   reflections, is also investigated for the first time.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to conduct highly localized delivery of contrast agents,
   viral vectors, therapeutic or pharmacological agents, and signaling
   molecules or dyes to live mammalian embryos is greatly desired to enable
   a variety of studies in the field of developmental biology, such as
   investigating the molecular regulation of cardiovascular morphogenesis.
   To meet such a demand, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of
   employing optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guide microinjections in
   live mouse embryos, which provides precisely targeted manipulation with
   spatial resolution at the micrometer scale. The feasibility
   demonstration is performed with experimental studies on cultured live
   mouse embryos at E8.5 and E9.5. Additionally, we investigate the
   OCT-guided microinjection of gold-silica nanoshells to the yolk sac
   vasculature of live cultured mouse embryos at the stage when the heart
   just starts to beat, as a potential approach for dynamic assessment of
   cardiovascular form and function before the onset of blood cell
   circulation. Also, the capability of OCT to quantitatively monitor and
   measure injection volume is presented. Our results indicate that
   OCT-guided microinjection could be a useful tool for mouse embryonic
   research. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a multimodal approach that combines a pump-probe with
   confocal reflectance and multiphoton autofluorescence microscopy.
   Pump-probe microscopy has been proven to be of great value in analyzing
   thin tissue sections of pigmented lesions, as it produces molecular
   contrast which is inaccessible by other means. However, the higher
   optical intensity required to overcome scattering in thick tissue leads
   to higher-order nonlinearities in the optical response of melanin (e.g.,

   for interpreting the data. We show that analysis of pigment composition
   in vivo must carefully account for signal terms that are nonlinear with
   respect to the pump and probe intensities. We find that pump-probe
   imaging gives useful contrast for pigmented structures over a large
   range of spatial scales (100 mu m to 1 cm), making it a potentially
   useful tool for tracking the progression of pigmented lesions without
   the need to introduce exogenous contrast agents. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{The authors have examined bismuth concentration profiles in GaAs1-xBix
   films grown by molecular beam epitaxy using high angle annular dark
   field imaging (Z-contrast imaging) in an aberration-corrected scanning
   transmission electron microscope in conjunction with x-ray diffraction.
   Samples were grown with a gradient in each of the component fluxes, and
   therefore, the III/V ratio across the substrate. Rotating the sample
   during growth exposed the growth surface to an oscillating III/V flux
   ratio. Sinusoidal {[}Bi] profiles resulted in the growth direction, the
   wavelength and number of which were consistent with the growth rate and
   the rate of substrate rotation. However, the magnitude of {[}Bi] in the
   observed fluctuations was greater than the maximum {[}Bi] achieved using
   the same Bi flux and Ga/As flux ratios in steady-state conditions on a
   stationary substrate, suggesting that varying the III/V flux ratio
   during growth promotes the incorporation of Bi in GaAs1-xBix films. A
   proposed qualitative model for how this enhancement might occur
   hypothesizes a critical role for alternating growth and shrinkage of
   Ga-Bi predroplet clusters on the surface as the growing material is
   rotated through Ga-rich and As-rich flux compositions. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Optical cavities with multiple tunable resonances have the potential to
   provide unique electromagnetic environments at two or more distinct
   wavelengths critical for control of optical processes such as nonlinear
   generation, entangled photon generation, or photoluminescence (PL)

   antenna design that has two tunable resonant modes in the visible
   spectrum separated by 350 nm and with line widths of similar to 60 nm.
   The importance of utilizing two resonances simultaneously is
   demonstrated by integrating monolayer MoS2, a two-dimensional
   semiconductor, into the colloidally synthesized nanocavities. We observe
   a 2000-fold enhancement in the PL intensity Of MoS2-which has
   intrinsically low absorption and small quantum yield-at room
   temperature, enabled by the combination of tailored absorption
   enhancement at the first harmonic and PL quantum-yield enhancement at
   the fundamental resonance.}},

Abstract = {{A conventional ultrasound image is formed by transmitting a focused wave
   into tissue, time-shifting the back-scattered echoes received on an
   array transducer, and summing the resulting signals. The van
   Cittert-Zernike theorem predicts a particular similarity, or coherence,
   of these focused signals across the receiving array. Many groups have
   used an estimate of the coherence to augment or replace the B-mode image
   in an effort to suppress noise and stationary clutter echo signals, but
   this measurement requires access to individual receive channel data.
   Most clinical systems have efficient pipelines for producing focused and
   summed RF data without any direct way to individually address the
   receive channels. We describe a method for performing coherence
   measurements that is more accessible for a wide range of coherence-based
   imaging. The reciprocity of the transmit and receive apertures in the
   context of coherence is derived and equivalence of the coherence
   function is validated experimentally using a research scanner. The
   proposed method is implemented on a commercial ultrasound system and in
   vivo short-lag spatial coherence imaging is demonstrated using only
   summed RF data. The components beyond the acquisition hardware and
   beamformer necessary to produce a real-time ultrasound coherence imaging
   system are discussed.}},

Title = {{Reducing the effects of acoustic heterogeneity with an iterative
   reconstruction method from experimental data in microwave induced
   thermoacoustic tomography}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: An iterative reconstruction method has been previously reported
   by the authors of this paper. However, the iterative reconstruction
   method was demonstrated by solely using the numerical simulations. It is
   essential to apply the iterative reconstruction method to practice
   conditions. The objective of this work is to validate the capability of
   the iterative reconstruction method for reducing the effects of acoustic
   heterogeneity with the experimental data in microwave induced
   thermoacoustic tomography.
   Methods: Most existing reconstruction methods need to combine the
   ultrasonic measurement technology to quantitatively measure the velocity
   distribution of heterogeneity, which increases the system complexity.
   Different to existing reconstruction methods, the iterative
   reconstruction method combines time reversal mirror technique, fast
   marching method, and simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique to
   iteratively estimate the velocity distribution of heterogeneous tissue
   by solely using the measured data. Then, the estimated velocity
   distribution is used subsequently to reconstruct the highly accurate
   image of microwave absorption distribution. Experiments that a target
   placed in an acoustic heterogeneous environment are performed to
   validate the iterative reconstruction method.
   Results: By using the estimated velocity distribution, the target in an
   acoustic heterogeneous environment can be reconstructed with better
   shape and higher image contrast than targets that are reconstructed with
   a homogeneous velocity distribution.
   Conclusions: The distortions caused by the acoustic heterogeneity can be
   efficiently corrected by utilizing the velocity distribution estimated
   by the iterative reconstruction method. The advantage of the iterative
   reconstruction method over the existing correction methods is that it is
   successful in improving the quality of the image of microwave absorption
   distribution without increasing the system complexity. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Technologies that enable targeted manipulation of epigenetic marks could
   be used to precisely control cell phenotype or interrogate the
   relationship between the epigenome and transcriptional control. Here we
   describe a programmable, CRISPR-Cas9-based acetyltransferase consisting
   of the nuclease-null dCas9 protein fused to the catalytic core of the
   human acetyltransferase p300. The fusion protein catalyzes acetylation
   of histone H3 lysine 27 at its target sites, leading to robust
   transcriptional activation of target genes from promoters and both
   proximal and distal enhancers. Gene activation by the targeted
   acetyltransferase was highly specific across the genome. In contrast to
   previous dCas9-based activators, the acetyltransferase activates genes
   from enhancer regions and with an individual guide RNA. We also show
   that the core p300 domain can be fused to other programmable DNA-binding
   proteins. These results support targeted acetylation as a causal
   mechanism of transactivation and provide a robust tool for manipulating
   gene regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Chitin is a widespread renewable biopolymer that is extensively
   distributed in the natural world. The high thermal stability of chitin
   provides an opportunity to develop novel inorganic-organic composites
   under hydrothermal synthesis conditions in vitro. For the first time, in
   this work we prepared monolithic silica-chitin composite under extreme
   biomimetic conditions (80 degrees C and pH 1.5) using three dimensional
   chitinous matrices isolated from the marine sponge Aplysina cauliformis.
   The resulting material was studied using light and fluorescence
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. A mechanism for the silica-chitin interaction after
   exposure to these hydrothermal conditions is proposed and discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{To identify chromatin mechanisms of neuronal differentiation, we
   characterized chromatin accessibility and gene expression in cerebellar
   granule neurons (CGNs) of the developing mouse. We used DNase-seq to map
   accessibility of cis-regulatory elements and RNA-seq to profile
   transcript abundance across postnatal stages of neuronal differentiation
   in vivo and in culture. We observed thousands of chromatin accessibility
   changes as CGNs differentiated, and verified, using H3K27ac ChIP-seq,
   reporter gene assays and CRISPR-mediated activation, that many of these
   regions function as neuronal enhancers. Motif discovery in
   differentially accessible chromatin regions suggested a previously
   unknown role for the Zic family of transcription factors in CGN
   maturation. We confirmed the association of Zic with these elements by
   ChIP-seq and found, using knockdown, that Zic1 and Zic2 are required for
   coordinating mature neuronal gene expression patterns. Together, our
   data reveal chromatin dynamics at thousands of gene regulatory elements
   that facilitate the gene expression patterns necessary for neuronal
   differentiation and function.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive understanding of the fate of contaminant-laden biosolids
   is needed to fully evaluate the environmental impacts of biosolid land
   application. The present study examined the fate of several flame
   retardants and triclosan in biosolid-amended soil in a 90-d greenhouse
   experiment. Objectives included evaluating the persistence of these
   compounds in soil, their phytoaccumulation potential by alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa), and potential degradation reactions. Concentrations
   of the polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners BDE-47 and BDE-209
   and the antimicrobial triclosan declined significantly over time in
   biosolid-amended soil planted with alfalfa and then reached a steady
   state by day 28. In contrast, no significant losses of those analytes
   were observed from soil in nonvegetated pots. The amount of an analyte
   lost from vegetated soil ranged from 43\% for the flame retardant
   di(2-ethylhexyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrabromophthalate to 61\% for triclosan and
   was significantly and negatively related to the log octanol-water
   partition coefficient. Alfalfa roots and shoots were monitored for the
   compounds, but no clear evidence of phytoaccumulation was observed.
   Methyl triclosan formation was observed in the biosolid-amended soils
   during the study period, indicating in situ biotransformation of
   triclosan. The present study demonstrates that, although they are highly
   recalcitrant, PBDEs, selected alternate brominated flame retardants, and
   triclosan are capable of undergoing dissipation from biosolid-amended
   soils in the presence of plants. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:968-976.

Title = {{A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Multiple Instance Learning}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a type of supervised learning in
   which labels are available for sets of observations (bags), but not for
   individual observations (instances). MIL has been applied in different
   areas, which has led to a large number of algorithms for learning based
   on MIL data. Many of these approaches focus on maximizing class margins,
   performing instance selection, or developing distance metrics and
   kernels suitable for application directly to bags. Although these
   approaches have shown promise, most require cross-validation- based
   optimization of hyper parameters or iterative numerical optimization to
   determine the proper number of target concepts. This work proposes a
   nonparametric Bayesian approach to learning in MIL scenarios based on
   Dirichlet process mixture models. The nonparametric nature of the model
   and the use of noninformative priors remove the need to perform
   cross-validation-based optimization while variational Bayesian inference
   allows for rapid parameter learning. The resulting approach generalizes
   to different applications by easily incorporating alternate data
   generation models. In a related effort {[}A. Manandhar et al., IEEE
   Trans. Geosci. Remote Sensing 53(4) (2015) 1737-1745.], the proposed
   model has been extended to incorporate time-varying data. Results
   indicate that when the data generation assumption holds, the proposed
   approach performs competitively with existing MIL and nonMIL methods for
   several standard MIL datasets and a new MIL dataset introduced in this
   work.}},

Abstract = {{Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a life-threatening disease that leads
   to a grotesque enlargement of the kidney and significant loss of
   function. Several imaging studies with MRI have demonstrated that cyst
   size in polycystic kidneys can determine disease severity and
   progression. In the present study, we found that, although kidney volume
   and cyst volume decreased with drug treatment, renal function did not
   improve with treatment. Here, we applied dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
   to study PKD in a Glis3 (GLI-similar 3)-deficient mouse model. Cysts
   from this model have a wide range of sizes and develop at an early age.
   To capture this crucial stage and assess cysts in detail, we imaged
   during early development (3-17 weeks) and applied high spatiotemporal
   resolution MRI (125x125x125cubic microns every 7.7s). A drug treatment
   with rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) was applied to determine
   whether disease progression could be halted. The effect and synergy
   (interaction) of aging and treatment were evaluated using an analysis of
   variance (ANOVA). Structural measurements, including kidney volume, cyst
   volume and cyst-to-kidney volume ratio, changed significantly with age.
   Drug treatment significantly decreased these metrics. Functional
   measurements of time-to-peak (TTP) mean and TTP variance were
   determined. TTP mean did not change with age, whereas TTP variance
   increased with age. Treatment with rapamycin generally did not affect
   these functional metrics. Synergistic effects of treatment and age were
   not found for any measurements. Together, the size and volume ratio of
   cysts decreased with drug treatment, whereas renal function remained the
   same. The quantification of renal structure and function with MRI can
   comprehensively assess the pathophysiology of PKD and response to
   treatment. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Multimodal Characterization of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
   Reveals Alterations in Outer Retinal Function and Structure}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To identify changes in retinal function and structure in
   persons with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), including the
   effects of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP).
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Participants: Thirty adults who underwent PRP for PDR, 15 adults with
   untreated PDR, and 15 age-matched controls.
   Methods: Contrast sensitivity, frequency doubling perimetry (FDP),
   Humphrey visual fields, photostress recovery, and dark adaptation were
   assessed. Fundus photography and macular spectral-domain optical
   coherence tomography (SD OCT) were performed. To quantify retinal layer
   thicknesses, SD OCT scans were segmented semiautomatically.
   Main Outcome Measures: Visual function measures were compared among
   patients with PDR and PRP, untreated patients with PDR, and controls.
   Mean retinal layer thicknesses were compared between groups. Correlation
   analyses were performed to evaluate associations between visual function
   measures and retinal layer thicknesses.
   Results: A significant reduction of FDP mean deviation (MD) was
   exhibited in PRP-treated patients with PDR (MD +/- standard deviation, -
   8.20 +/- 5.76 dB; P < 0.0001) and untreated patients (- 5.48 +/- 4.48
   dB; P < 0.0001) relative to controls (1.07 +/- 2.50 dB). Reduced log
   contrast sensitivity compared with controls (1.80 +/- 0.14) also was
   observed in both PRP-treated patients (1.42 +/- 0.17; P < 0.0001) and
   untreated patients (1.56 +/- 0.20; P = 0.001) with PDR. Compared with
   controls, patients treated with PRP demonstrated increased photostress
   recovery time (151.02 +/- 104.43 vs. 70.64 +/- 47.14 seconds; P = 0.001)
   and dark adaptation speed (12.80 +/- 5.15 vs. 9.74 +/- 2.56 minutes; P =
   0.022). Patients who underwent PRP had diffusely thickened nerve fiber
   layers (P = 0.024) and diffusely thinned retinal pigment epithelium
   (RPE) layers (P = 0.009) versus controls. Untreated patients with PDR
   also had diffusely thinned RPE layers (P = 0.031) compared with
   controls.
   Conclusions: Patients with untreated PDR exhibited inner retinal
   dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced contrast sensitivity and FDP
   performance, accompanied by alterations in inner and outer retinal
   structure. Patients who underwent PRP had more profound changes in outer
   retinal structure and function. Distinguishing the effects of PDR and
   PRP may guide the development of restorative vision therapies for
   patients with advanced diabetic retinopathy. (C) 2015 by the American

Title = {{A metastatistical approach to rainfall extremes}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{121-126}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The traditional statistical theory of extreme events assumes an
   asymptotic regime in which the number of events per year is large enough
   for a limiting Generalized Extreme Value distribution to apply. This has
   been shown not to be applicable to many practical cases. We introduce
   here a Metastatistical Extreme Value (MEV) approach which is defined in
   terms of the distribution of the statistical parameters describing
   ``ordinary'' daily rainfall occurrence and intensity. The method does
   not require an asymptotic assumption, and naturally accounts for the
   influence of the bulk of the distribution of ordinary events on the
   distribution of annual maximum daily rainfall. Building on existing
   observations showing the distribution of daily rainfall to be Weibull
   right-tail equivalent, the MEV approach is then specialized to yield a
   compact and easily applicable formulation. We apply this formulation to
   Monte Carlo experiments based on Weibull statistics derived from the
   3-century long rainfall time series observed in Padova (Italy). We find
   an excellent agreement between MEV estimates and the `observed'
   frequency of occurrence of extreme events in the synthetic time series
   generated. GEV and Gumbel estimates, on the contrary, exhibit systematic
   errors. Tests with different rates of occurrence of rainfall events show
   slight improvements of the GEV and Gumbel estimation bias when the
   number of events/year is increased. However, a constant bias in GEV and
   Gumbel estimates is seen for (synthetic) climates where the number of
   events and the distribution of intensities is varied stochastically. The
   estimation root mean square error is also larger for the GEV and Gumbel
   distributions than for the MEV approach. Hence, GEV and Gumbel quantile
   estimates are more likely to be further away from the actual value than
   MEV estimates. Finally, the application of the new MEV approach to
   subsets of the long Padova time series identifies marked variabilities
   in rainfall extremes at the centennial time scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The paper develops a reduced-order model of nonsynchronous vibration
   (NSV) using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) methods. The approach
   was successfully developed and implemented, requiring between two and
   six POD modes to accurately predict computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   solutions that are experiencing NSV. This POD method was first developed
   and demonstrated for a transversely moving, two-dimensional cylinder in
   cross-flow. Later, the method was used for the prediction of CFD
   solutions for a two-dimensional compressor blade. This research is the
   first to offer a POD approach to the reduced-order modeling of NSV in
   turbomachinery. Modeling NSV is especially challenging because NSV is
   caused by complicated, unsteady flow dynamics; this initial study helps
   researchers understand the causes of NSV, and aids in the future
   development of predictive tools for aeromechanical design engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional diagnostic ultrasound images of the anatomy (as opposed to
   blood flow) reveal differences in the acoustic properties of soft
   tissues (mainly echogenicity but also, to some extent, attenuation),
   whereas ultrasound-based elasticity images are able to reveal the
   differences in the elastic properties of soft tissues (e.g., elasticity
   and viscosity). The benefit of elasticity imaging lies in the fact that
   many soft tissues can share similar ultrasonic echogenicities but may
   have different mechanical properties that can be used to clearly
   visualize normal anatomy and delineate pathologic lesions. Typically,
   all elasticity measurement and imaging methods introduce a mechanical
   excitation and monitor the resulting tissue response. Some of the most
   widely available commercial elasticity imaging methods are
   `quasi-static' and use external tissue compression to generate images of
   the resulting tissue strain (or deformation). In addition, many
   manufacturers now provide shear wave imaging and measurement methods,
   which deliver stiffness images based upon the shear wave propagation
   speed. The goal of this review is to describe the fundamental physics
   and the associated terminology underlying these technologies. We have
   included a questions and answers section, an extensive appendix, and a
   glossary of terms in this manuscript. We have also endeavored to ensure
   that the terminology and descriptions, although not identical, are
   broadly compatible across the WFUMB and EFSUMB sets of guidelines on
   elastography (Bamber et al. 2013; Cosgrove et al. 2013). (C) 2015

   recommendations are made on evidence-based results. Practical advice is
   given on how to perform and interpret breast elastography for optimal
   results, with emphasis placed on avoiding pitfalls. Artifacts are
   reviewed, and the clinical utility of some artifacts is discussed. Both
   strain and shear wave techniques have been shown to be highly accurate
   in characterizing breast lesions as benign or malignant. The
   relationship between the various techniques is discussed, and

Abstract = {{A multi-layered flux footprint model is developed for a canopy situated
   within a protected environment such as a screenhouse. The model accounts
   for the vertically distributed sources and sinks within the canopy as
   well as modifications introduced by the screen on the flow field and
   micro-environment. The effect of the screen on fetch as a function of
   its relative height above the canopy is then studied and compared to the
   case where the screen is absent. It is found that the required fetch is
   not appreciably affected by the vertical source-sink distribution in
   open and protected environments, but changes with the canopy density.
   Moreover, the fetch-to-height ratio is increased by the presence of the
   screen, at least when compared to the open environment case. How
   footprint analysis can be employed to estimate the ratio between
   above-canopy measured flux and vertically-integrated canopy source-sink
   strengths in a prototypical screenhouse is illustrated and further
   evaluated against eddy-covariance measurements from two screenhouse
   experiments.}},

Volume = {{155}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel constrained integration (CINT) method for
   solving initial boundary value partial differential equations (PDEs).
   The CINT method combines classical Galerkin methods with a constrained
   backpropogation training approach to obtain an artificial neural network
   representation of the PDE solution that approximately satisfies the
   boundary conditions at every integration step. The advantage of CINT
   over existing methods is that it is readily applicable to solving PDEs
   on irregular domains, and requires no special modification for domains
   with complex geometries. Furthermore, the CINT method provides a
   semi-analytical solution that is infinitely differentiable. In this
   paper the CINT method is demonstrated on two hyperbolic and one
   parabolic initial boundary value problems with a known analytical
   solutions that can be used for performance comparison. The numerical
   results show that, when compared to the most efficient finite element
   methods, the CINT method achieves significant improvements both in terms
   of computational time and accuracy. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An experiment was undertaken to measure the concentration of soil
   organic carbon (SOC) in particles mobilized by rainfall splash under
   natural precipitation and to assess its relationship with soil and
   precipitation properties. Splash cups were deployed on three
   agricultural soils typical of the central Ebro Valley in Spain (a
   Cambisol, a Gypsisol, and a Solonchak), and the rainfall characteristics
   (intensity, kinetic energy) were measured by means of a disdrometer
   (optical spectro-pluviometer). Evidences of SOC enrichment, i.e. a
   significantly higher concentration in the splashed material with respect
   to the parent material, were found in the three soils under study.
   Differences were found, too, between two particle size fractions (less
   than 0.05 mm and between 0.05 and 0.5 mm), with higher SOC enrichment in
   the coarsest fraction. While the amount of splash was clearly related to
   the erosivity of each rainfall event, no significant effect was found
   with respect to the SOC concentration. Between the three soils, the
   Gypsisol exhibited the highest rates of SOC enrichment, and also the
   largest difference between size fractions. Splash plays an important
   role on mobilizing fresh carbon fractions, and under certain conditions
   it may interrupt the soil carbon cycling by favoring the removal of SOC
   by other erosive processes such as runoff wash, thus preventing its
   incorporation into the soil carbon pool. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{On 31 May 2013, a line of severe tornadic thunderstorms (the El Reno
   event) developed during the local afternoon in central Oklahoma, USA.
   Within range of the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array, the evolution of
   the event can be separated into three distinct periods: an Early period
   (before 02:00 UTC on 1 June) when the storm consisted of discrete
   supercells, a Middle period (02:00-05:00 UTC) when the convection began
   merging into a linear feature and stratiform precipitation developed,
   and a Late period (after 05:00 UTC) featuring a mature mesoscale
   convective system (MCS). Each of these periods demonstrated distinct
   patterns in the large (>100Ckm) charge moment change (CMC) lightning
   that was produced. During the Early period, large-CMC positive
   cloud-to-ground (+CG) lightning was produced in the convective cores of
   supercells. These flashes were small in area (typically <500km(2)) and
   were commonly associated with a sloping midlevel positive charge region
   in the echo overhang on the storm's forward flank. The Middle period
   featured a population of larger +CMCs (>500km(2), >300Ckm) in the
   developing stratiform, similar to typical sprite-parent lightning in
   MCSs. During the Late period, convective large CMC +CGs ceased and
   instead large-CMC negative CGs were produced in and near the MCS
   convection. These flashes neutralized charge both in convection as well
   as in adjacent stratiform and anvil precipitation. The results suggest
   that the CMC metric has potential applications for studying tropospheric
   weather.}},

Abstract = {{Wind tunnel experiments were performed to explore how leaf size and leaf
   microroughness impact the collection efficiency of ultrafine particles
   (UFP) at the branch scale. A porous media model previously used to
   characterize UFP deposition onto conifers (Pinus taeda and Juniperus
   chinensis) was employed to interpret these wind tunnel measurements for
   four different broadleaf species (Ilex cornuta, Quercus alba, Magnolia
   grandiflora, and Lonicera fragrantissima) and three wind speed (0.3-0.9
   ms(-1)) conditions. Among the four broadleaf species considered, Ilex
   cornuta with its partially folded shape and sharp edges was the most
   efficient at collecting UFP followed by the other three flat-shaped
   broadleaf species. The findings here suggest that a connection must
   exist between UFP collection and leaf dimension and roughness. This
   connection is shown to be primarily due to the thickness of a
   quasi-laminar boundary layer pinned to the leaf surface assuming the
   flow over a leaf resembles that of a flat plate. A scaling analysis that
   utilizes a three-sublayer depositional model for a flat plate of finite
   size and roughness embedded within the quasi-laminar boundary layer
   illustrates these connections. The analysis shows that a longer leaf
   dimension allows for thicker quasi-laminar boundary layers to develop. A
   thicker quasi-laminar boundary layer depth in turn increases the overall
   resistance to UFP deposition due to an increase in the diffusional path
   length thereby reducing the leaf-scale UFP collection efficiency. It is
   suggested that the effects of leaf microroughness are less relevant to
   the UFP collection efficiency than are the leaf dimensions for the four
   broadleaf species explored here.}},

   change the regularity of the basis functions, and can be easily
   generalized to arbitrary dimensions. Data transfer during both
   refinement and coarsening is addressed. The techniques are then applied

   saliency detection}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{301}},
Pages = {{215-226}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Infrared target tracking has attracted extensive research efforts in
   recent years. However, effective and efficient infrared target tracking
   is still a hard problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, difficulty
   of robustly describing complicated appearance variations as well as the
   abrupt motion of targets. In this paper, we propose a tracking method
   under the Particle Filtering framework by using a hierarchical sampling
   method, in which two complementary appearance models are used. Firstly,
   a saliency appearance model is proposed to suppress the cluttered
   background and properly guide particles to appropriate states. Then the
   eigen space model is employed as the other observation method to
   accurately estimate the target state. The hierarchical sampling process
   is proposed to incorporate the two complementary observation models to
   account for the abrupt motion efficiently. Experimental results on AMCOM
   FLIR sequences and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods
   demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to appearance changes as
   well as drastic abrupt motions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Linear, time-varying (LTV) systems composed of time shifts, frequency
   shifts, and complex amplitude scalings are operators that act on
   continuous finite-energy waveforms. This paper presents a novel,
   resource-efficient method for identifying the parametric description of
   such systems, i.e., the time shifts, frequency shifts, and scalings,
   from the sampled response to linear frequency modulated (LFM) waveforms,
   with emphasis on the application to radar processing. If the LTV
   operator is probed with a sufficiently diverse set of LFM waveforms,
   then the system can be identified with high accuracy. In the case of
   noiseless measurements, the identification is perfect, while in the case
   of noisy measurements, the accuracy is inversely proportional to the
   noise level. The use of parametric estimation techniques with recently
   proposed denoising algorithms allows the estimation of the parameters

Abstract = {{We present results from experiments and atomistic molecular dynamics
   simulations on the remediation of naphthalene by polyamidoamine (PAMAM)
   dendrimers and graphene oxide (GrO). Specifically, we investigate
   3(rd)-6(th) generation (G3-G6) PAMAM dendrimers and GrO with different
   levels of oxidation. The work is motivated by the potential applications
   of these emerging nanomaterials in removing polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon contaminants from water. Our experimental results indicate
   that GrO outperforms dendrimers in removing naphthalene from water.
   Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the prominent factors
   driving naphthalene association to these seemingly disparate materials
   are similar. Interestingly, we find that cooperative interactions
   between the naphthalene molecules play a significant role in enhancing
   their association to the dendrimers and GrO. Our findings highlight that
   while selection of appropriate materials is important, the interactions
   between the contaminants themselves can also be important in governing
   the effectiveness of a given material. The combined use of experiments
   and molecular dynamics simulations allows us to comment on the possible
   factors resulting in better performance of GrO in removing polyaromatic
   contaminants from water.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular-scale Network-on-Chip (mNoC) crossbars use quantum dot LEDs as
   an on-chip light source, and chromophores to provide optical signal
   filtering for receivers. An mNoC reduces power consumption or enables
   scaling to larger crossbars for a reduced energy budget compared to
   current nanophotonic NoC crossbars. Since communication latency is
   reduced by using a high-radix crossbar, minimizing power consumption
   becomes a primary design target. Conventional Single Writer Multiple
   Reader (SWMR) photonic crossbar designs broadcast all packets, and incur
   the commensurate required power, even if only two nodes are
   communicating.
   This paper introduces power topologies, enabled by unique capabilities
   of mNoC technology, to reduce overall interconnect power consumption. A
   power topology corresponds to the logical connectivity provided by a
   given power mode. Broadcast is one power mode and it consumes the
   maximum power. Additional power modes consume less power but allow a
   source to communicate with only a statically defined, potentially
   non-contiguous, subset of nodes. Overall interconnect power is reduced
   if the more frequently communicating nodes use modes that consume less
   power, while less frequently communicating nodes use modes that consume
   more power. We also investigate thread mapping techniques to fully
   exploit power topologies. We explore various mNoC power topologies with
   one, two and four power modes for a radix-256 SWMR mNoC crossbar. Our
   results show that the combination of power topologies and intelligent
   thread mapping can reduce total mNoC power by up to 51\% on average for
   a set of 12 SPLASH benchmarks. Furthermore performance is 10\% better
   than conventional resonator-based photonic NoCs and energy is reduced by
   72\%.}},

Abstract = {{Regenerative medicine has the potential to drastically change the field
   of health care from reactive to preventative and restorative. Exciting
   advances in stem cell biology and cellular reprogramming have fueled the
   progress of this field. Biochemical cues in the form of small molecule
   drugs, growth factors, zinc finger protein transcription factors and
   nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, monoclonal
   antibodies, plasmid DNA, aptamers, or RNA interference agents can play
   an important role to influence stem cell differentiation and the outcome
   of tissue regeneration. Many of these biochemical factors are fragile
   and must act intracellularly at the molecular level. They require an
   effective delivery system, which can take the form of a scaffold (e.g.,
   hydrogels and electrospun fibers), carrier (viral and nonviral), nano-
   and microparticle, or genetically modified cell. In this review, we will
   discuss the history and current technologies of drug, protein, and gene
   delivery in the context of regenerative medicine. Next, we will present
   case examples of how delivery technologies are being applied to promote
   angiogenesis in nonhealing wounds or prevent angiogenesis in age related
   macular degeneration. Finally, we will conclude with a brief discussion
   of the regulatory pathway from bench to bedside for the clinical
   translation of these novel therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for elastic
   waves suffers from the staircasing error when applied to model a curved
   free surface because of the structured grid. This is similar to the
   situation for the FDTD method in electromagnetics when it is applied to
   model a curved perfect conductor surface, where the conformal FDTD
   methods have been recently developed to avoid this error. In this work a
   stable and second-order accurate 2-D FDTD method for elastic wave
   modelling on a curved free surface is presented based on the finite
   volume method and enlarged cell technique (ECT). To achieve a
   sufficiently accurate implementation, a finite volume scheme is applied
   to the curved free surface to remove the staircasing error; in the
   meantime, to achieve the same stability as the FDTD method without
   reducing the time step increment, the ECT is introduced to preserve the
   solution stability even for small irregular cells. This method is
   verified by several 2-D numerical examples. Results show that the method
   is second-order accurate and stable at the Courant stability limit for a
   regular FDTD grid.}},

Title = {{A Power-Law Dependence of Bacterial Invasion on Mammalian Host Receptors}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria and Yersinia gain initial entry by
   binding to host target cells and stimulating their internalization.
   Bacterial uptake entails successive, increasingly strong associations
   between receptors on the surface of bacteria and hosts. Even with
   genetically identical cells grown in the same environment, there are
   vast differences in the number of bacteria entering any given cell. To
   gain insight into this variability, we examined uptake dynamics of
   Escherichia coli engineered to express the invasin surface receptor from
   Yersinia, which enables uptake via mammalian host beta(1)-integrins.
   Surprisingly, we found that the uptake probability of a single bacterium
   follows a simple power-law dependence on the concentration of integrins.
   Furthermore, the value of a power-law parameter depends on the
   particular host-bacterium pair but not on bacterial concentration. This
   power-law captures the complex, variable processes underlying bacterial
   invasion while also enabling differentiation of cell lines.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There is a critical need to better use existing antibiotics due to the
   urgent threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria coupled with the reduced
   effort in developing new antibiotics. beta-lactam antibiotics represent
   one of the most commonly used classes of antibiotics to treat a broad
   spectrum of Gram-positive and -negative bacterial pathogens. However,
   the rise of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria
   has limited the use of beta-lactams. Due to the concern of complex drug
   responses, many beta-lactams are typically ruled out if ESBL-producing
   pathogens are detected, even if these pathogens test as susceptible to
   some beta-lactams. Using quantitative modeling, we show that
   beta-lactams could still effectively treat pathogens producing low or
   moderate levels of ESBLs when administered properly. We further develop
   a metric to guide the design of a dosing protocol to optimize treatment
   efficiency for any antibiotic-pathogen combination. Ultimately,
   optimized dosing protocols could allow reintroduction of a repertoire of
   first-line antibiotics with improved treatment outcomes and preserve
   last-resort antibiotics.}},

Title = {{The influence of water table depth and the free atmospheric state on
   convective rainfall predisposition}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2283-2297}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A mechanistic model for the soil-plant system is coupled to a
   conventional slab representation of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
   to explore the role of groundwater table (WT) variations and free
   atmospheric (FA) states on convective rainfall predisposition (CRP) at a
   Loblolly pine plantation site situated in the lower coastal plain of
   North Carolina. Predisposition is quantified using the crossing between
   modeled lifting condensation level (LCL) and convectively grown ABL
   depth. The LCL-ABL depth crossing is necessary for air saturation but
   not sufficient for cloud formation and subsequent convective rainfall
   occurrence. However, such crossing forms the main template for which all
   subsequent dynamical processes regulating the formation (or suppression)
   of convective rainfall operate on. If the feedback between surface
   fluxes and FA conditions is neglected, a reduction in latent heat flux
   associated with reduced WT levels is shown to enhance the ABL-LCL
   crossing probability. When the soil-plant system is fully coupled with
   ABL dynamics thereby allowing feedback with ABL temperature and
   humidity, FA states remain the leading control on CRP. However,
   vegetation water stress plays a role in controlling ABL-LCL crossing
   when the humidity supply by the FA is within an intermediate range of
   values. When FA humidity supply is low, cloud formation is suppressed
   independent of surface latent heat flux. Similarly, when FA moisture
   supply is high, cloud formation can occur independent of surface latent
   heat flux. In an intermediate regime of FA moisture supply, the surface
   latent heat flux controlled by soil water availability can supplement
   (or suppress) the necessary water vapor leading to reduced LCL and
   subsequent ABL-LCL crossing. It is shown that this intermediate state
   corresponds to FA values around the mode in observed humidity lapse
   rates (w) (between -2.5 x 10(-6) and -1.5 x 10(-6) kg kg(-1)m(-1)),
   suggesting that vegetation water uptake may be controlling CRP at the
   study site.}},

Title = {{Spatial proximity amplifies valence in emotional memory and defensive
   approach-avoidance}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{In urban areas, people often have to stand or move in close proximity to
   others. The egocentric distance to stimuli is a powerful determinant of
   defensive behavior in animals. Yet, little is known about how spatial
   proximity to others alters defensive responses in humans. We
   hypothesized that the valence of social cues scales with egocentric
   distance, such that proximal social stimuli have more positive or
   negative valence than distal stimuli. This would predict enhanced
   defensive responses to proximal threat and reduced defensive responses
   to proximal reward. We tested this hypothesis across four experiments
   using 3-D virtual reality simulations. Results from Experiment 1
   confirmed that proximal social stimuli facilitate defensive responses,
   as indexed by fear-potentiated startle, relative to distal stimuli.
   Experiment 2 revealed that interpersonal defensive boundaries flexibly
   increase with aversive learning. Experiment 3 examined whether spatial
   proximity enhances memory for aversive experiences. Fear memories for
   social threats encroaching on the body were more persistent than those
   acquired at greater interpersonal distances, as indexed by startle.
   Lastly, Experiment 4 examined how egocentric distance influenced startle
   responses to social threats during defensive approach and avoidance.
   Whereas fear-potentiated startle increased with proximity when
   participants actively avoided receiving shocks, startle decreased with
   proximity when participants tolerated shocks to receive monetary
   rewards, implicating opposing gradients of distance on threat versus
   reward. Thus, proximity in egocentric space amplifies the valence of
   social stimuli that, in turn, facilitates emotional memory and
   approach-avoidance responses. These findings have implications for
   understanding the consequences of increased urbanization on affective
   interpersonal behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Direct modification of exciton energy has been previously used to
   optimize the operation of organic optoelectronic devices. One
   demonstrated method for exciton energy modification is through the use
   of the solvent dielectric effects in doped molecular films. To gain a
   deeper appreciation of the underlying physical mechanisms, in this work
   we test the solid-state salvation effect in molecular thin films under
   applied external pressure. We observe that external mechanical pressure
   increases dipole-dipole interactions, leading to shifts in the Frenkel
   exciton energy and enhancement of the time-resolved spectral red shift
   associated with the energy-transfer-mediated exciton diffusion.
   Measurements are performed on host:dopant molecular thin films, which
   show bathochromic shifts in photoluminescence (PL) under increasing
   pressure. This is in agreement with a simple salvation theory model of
   exciton energetics with a fitting parameter based on the mechanical
   properties of the host matrix material. We measure no significant change
   in exciton lifetime with increasing pressure, consistent with unchanged
   aggregation in molecular films under compression. However, we do observe
   an increase in exciton spectral thermalization rate for compressed
   molecular films, indicating enhanced exciton diffusion for increased
   dipole-dipole interactions under pressure. The results highlight the
   contrast between molecular energy landscapes obtained when dipole-dipole
   interactions are increased by the pressure technique versus the
   conventional dopant concentration variation methods, which can lead to
   extraneous effects such as aggregation at higher doping concentrations.
   The present work demonstrates the use of pressure-probing techniques in
   studying energy disorder and exciton dynamics in amorphous molecular
   thin films.}},

Title = {{Modeling false positive error making patterns in radiology trainees for
   improved mammography education}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{50-57}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: While mammography notably contributes to earlier detection
   of breast cancer, it has its limitations, including a large number of
   false positive exams. Improved radiology education could potentially
   contribute to alleviating this issue. Toward this goal, in this paper we
   propose an algorithm for modeling of false positive error making among
   radiology trainees. Identifying troublesome locations for the trainees
   could focus their training and in turn improve their performance.
   Methods: The algorithm proposed in this paper predicts locations that
   are likely to result in a false positive error for each trainee based on
   the previous annotations made by the trainee. The algorithm consists of
   three steps. First, the suspicious false positive locations are
   identified in mammograms by Difference of Gaussian filter and suspicious
   regions are segmented by computer vision-based segmentation algorithms.
   Second, 133 features are extracted for each suspicious region to
   describe its distinctive characteristics. Third, a random forest
   classifier is applied to predict the likelihood of the trainee making a
   false positive error using the extracted features. The random forest
   classifier is trained using previous annotations made by the trainee. We
   evaluated the algorithm using data from a reader study in which 3
   experts and 10 trainees interpreted 100 mammographic cases.
   Results: The algorithm was able to identify locations where the trainee
   will commit a false positive error with accuracy higher than an
   algorithm that selects such locations randomly. Specifically, our
   algorithm found false positive locations with 40\% accuracy when only 1
   location was selected for all cases for each trainee and 12\% accuracy
   when 10 locations were selected. The accuracies for randomly identified
   locations were both 0\% for these two scenarios.
   Conclusions: In this first study on the topic, we were able to build
   computer models that were able to find locations for which a trainee
   will make a false positive error in images that were not previously seen
   by the trainee. Presenting the trainees with such locations rather than
   randomly selected ones may improve their educational outcomes. (C) 2015

   real-time, tunable lattice plasmon lasing based on arrays of gold
   nanoparticles and liquid gain materials. Optically pumped arrays of gold
   nanoparticles surrounded by liquid dye molecules exhibit lasing emission
   that can be tuned as a function of the dielectric environment.
   Wavelength-dependent time-resolved experiments show distinct lifetime
   characteristics below and above the lasing threshold. By integrating
   gold nanoparticle arrays within microfluidic channels and flowing in
   liquid gain materials with different refractive indices, we achieve
   dynamic tuning of the plasmon lasing wavelength. Tunable lattice plasmon
   lasers offer prospects to enhance and detect weak physical and chemical
   processes on the nanoscale in real time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the behavior of CO2 transmission in a micro direct
   methanol fuel cell (pDMFC) is investigated through both simulations and
   experiments. A model is built to describe the change of CO2 volume
   fraction in the anode channel under different operation parameters
   (e.g., current density, flow rate and operation temperature). In
   addition, the dynamic movement of a single CO2 bubble is also simulated
   to study the CO2 characteristics. Furthermore, a metal-based transparent
   liDMFC with the active area of 0.8 cm x 0.8 cm is designed and
   fabricated to evaluate the two-phase flow characteristic as well as the
   corresponding cell performance. Experimental results reveal that the
   operating current, the flow rate and the temperature can significantly
   influence the quantity and shape of CO2 bubbles: 1) small discrete
   bubbles can grow up to a gas column with the increase of operating
   current; 2) the amount and the size of CO2 bubbles will decrease with
   the increase of the flow rate; 3) higher operating temperature will
   prompt the size of CO2 bubbles. The experimental results are well in
   agreement with the simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Innovative materials were made via the combination of chitin and lignin,
   and the immobilization of lipase from Aspergillus niger. Analysis by
   techniques including FTIR, XPS and C-13 CP MAS NMR confirmed the
   effective immobilization of the enzyme on the surface of the composite
   support. The electrokinetic properties of the resulting systems were
   also determined. Results obtained from elemental analysis and by the
   Bradford method enabled the determination of optimum parameters for the
   immobilization process. Based on the hydrolysis reaction of
   para-nitrophenyl palmitate, a determination was made of the catalytic
   activity, thermal and pH stability, and reusability. The systems with
   immobilized enzymes were found to have a hydrolytic activity of 5.72 mU,
   and increased thermal and pH stability compared with the native lipase.
   The products were also shown to retain approximately 80\% of their
   initial catalytic activity, even after 20 reaction cycles. The
   immobilization process, using a cheap, non-toxic matrix of natural
   origin, leads to systems with potential applications in wastewater

Abstract = {{The challenge in getting a decent signal to the brain for users of
   cochlear implants (CIs) is described. A breakthrough occurred in 1989
   that later enabled most users to understand conversational speech with
   their restored hearing alone. Subsequent developments included

   with electrical stimulation on both sides or with acoustic stimulation
   in combination with a unilateral CI, the latter for persons with
   residual hearing at low frequencies in either or both ears. Both types
   of adjunctive stimulation produced further improvements in performance
   for substantial fractions of patients. Today, the Cl and related hearing
   prostheses are the standard of care for profoundly deaf persons and
   ever-increasing indications are now allowing persons with less severe
   losses to benefit from these marvelous technologies. The steps in
   achieving the present levels of performance are traced, and some

Pages = {{465-474}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of array shape estimation for passive
   towed sonar systems during platform maneuvers. Directional noise fields
   due to distant shipping lanes can be exploited as sources of opportunity
   for online array shape calibration. In this paper, a nonparametric noise
   field model is used to form field directionality maps for time-varying
   array shapes to exploit point and spatially spread sources. This
   formulation requires neither the number nor location of sources in the
   field to be known or estimated. Using acoustic data, a
   maximum-likelihood array shape estimate is derived where the shape is
   modeled as a polynomial in heading. Additionally, a method for fusing
   the shape estimate with heading sensor data is introduced. Heading
   sensors may permanently fail or suffer from high levels of noise during
   turns; thus acoustic data can be used to compensate for malfunctioning
   heading sensors during turns. The combined estimate is filtered using a
   dynamical model that is valid for sharp turns and accounts for motion of
   the array perpendicular to tow heading. Multisource simulations are used
   to demonstrate the performance of the acoustic-based estimate and
   robustness of the combined estimate.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4, 2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This work extends the matrix pencil method (MPM)-based synthesis
   technique to the case of nonuniformly spaced linear arrays with wideband
   frequency-invariant (FI) patterns. A new sampling strategy is proposed
   to obtain multiple pattern data of different frequencies having the same
   poles that correspond to the FI element positions. The obtained multiple
   pattern sequences have the same shape for the FI pattern requirement,
   but with different lengths. The generalized MPM (GMPM) and its
   forward-backward version (GFBMPM) are developed to estimate the best
   common element positions for different frequencies, which can
   significantly reduce the number of elements required for the specified
   wideband pattern shape. The element excitations are solved by the
   regularized least-square (LS) method at each frequency. Then, an
   efficient method by utilizing the FFT is presented to obtain
   real-coefficient finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters for implementing
   the frequency-varying excitations. A set of numerical examples for the
   FI synthesis of pencil-beams, shaped patterns, scannable patterns, and
   Taylor patterns with low SLLs are presented to validate the
   effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods. The element saving
   is about 11.2\%-49.4\% for usual cases.}},

Abstract = {{In this communication, a printed unidirectional antenna with improved
   upper band-edge selectivity is proposed to realize bandpass filtering
   gain performance. This antenna consists of a printed rectangular loop
   with two gaps: 1) a parasitic strip and 2) a parasitic loop. The
   rectangular loop provides good lower band-edge selectivity and the
   parasitic strip decides the location of upper band-edge selectivity. The
   parasitic loop, which acts as a director, is used to improve the
   capacity of upper band-edge selectivity. In addition, the passband
   bandwidth controllability of the antenna has also been explored. To
   demonstrate the effectiveness of this design, an antenna prototype is
   fabricated and tested. Experimental results verified the effectiveness
   of the proposed design. Measured results show that the fabricated
   antenna provides a 56.6\% passband bandwidth, ranging from 2.18 to 3.9
   GHz. Good bandpass filtering gain performance with a flat passband gain
   better than 4.4 dBi is achieved. Stable unidirectional radiation
   patterns with nearly identical E- and H-plane patterns in the operating
   bandwidth are also achieved. The measured front-to-back ratio is better
   than 10 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Surface modification of nanoparticles and biosensors is a dynamic,
   expanding area of research for targeted delivery in vivo. For more
   efficient delivery, surfaces are PEGylated to impart stealth properties,
   long circulation, and enable enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
   in tumor tissues. Previously, BF(2)dbm(I)PLA was proven to be a good
   oxygen nanosensor material for tumor hypoxia imaging in vivo, though
   particles were applied directly to the tumor and surrounding region.
   Further surface modification is needed for this dual-emissive oxygen
   sensitive material for effective intravenous (IV) administration and
   passive and active delivery to tumors. In this paper, an efficient
   synthesis of a new dual-emissive material BF(2)dbm(I)PLA-mPEG is
   presented and in vitro stability studies are conducted. It is found that
   fabricated nanoparticles are stable for 24 weeks as a suspension, while
   after 25 weeks the nanoparticles swell and both dye and polymer
   degradation escalates. Preliminary studies show BF(2)dbm(I)PLA-mPEG
   nanoparticle accumulation in a window chamber mammary tumor 24 h after
   IV injection into mice (C57Bl/6 strain) enabling tumor oxygen imaging.}},

Title = {{Prospective estimation of organ dose in CT under tube current modulation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1575-1585}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Computed tomography (CT) has been widely used worldwide as a
   tool for medical diagnosis and imaging. However, despite its significant
   clinical benefits, CT radiation dose at the population level has become
   a subject of public attention and concern. In this light, optimizing
   radiation dose has become a core responsibility for the CT community. As
   a fundamental step to manage and optimize dose, it may be beneficial to
   have accurate and prospective knowledge about the radiation dose for an
   individual patient. In this study, the authors developed a framework to
   prospectively estimate organ dose for chest and abdominopelvic CT exams
   under tube current modulation (TCM).
   Methods: The organ dose is mainly dependent on two key factors: patient
   anatomy and irradiation field. A prediction process was developed to
   accurately model both factors. To model the anatomical diversity and
   complexity in the patient population, the authors used a previously
   developed library of computational phantoms with broad distributions of
   sizes, ages, and genders. A selected clinical patient, represented by a
   computational phantom in the study, was optimally matched with another
   computational phantom in the library to obtain a representation of the
   patient's anatomy. To model the irradiation field, a previously
   validated Monte Carlo program was used to model CT scanner systems. The
   tube current profiles were modeled using a ray-tracing program as
   previously reported that theoretically emulated the variability of
   modulation profiles from major CT machine manufacturers Li et al.,
   {[}Phys. Med. Biol. 59, 4525-4548 (2014)]. The prediction of organ dose
   was achieved using the following process: (1) CTDIvol-normalized-organ
   dose coefficients (h(organ)) for fixed tube current were first estimated
   as the prediction basis for the computational phantoms; (2) each
   computation phantom, regarded as a clinical patient, was optimally
   matched with one computational phantom in the library; (3) to account
   for the effect of the TCM scheme, a weighted organ-specific CTDIvol
   {[}denoted as (CTDIvol)(organ,weighted)] was computed for each organ
   based on the TCM profile and the anatomy of the ``matched{''} phantom;
   (4) the organ dose was predicted by multiplying the weighted
   organ-specific CTDIvol with the organ dose coefficients (horgan). To
   quantify the prediction accuracy, each predicted organ dose was compared
   with the corresponding organ dose simulated from the Monte Carlo program
   with the TCM profile explicitly modeled.
   Results: The predicted organ dose showed good agreements with the
   simulated organ dose across all organs and modulation profiles. The
   average percentage error in organ dose estimation was generally within
   20\% across all organs and modulation profiles, except for organs
   located in the pelvic and shoulder regions. For an average CTDIvol of a
   CT exam of 10 mGy, the average error at full modulation strength (a = 1)
   across all organs was 0.91 mGy for chest exams, and 0.82 mGy for
   abdominopelvic exams.
   Conclusions: This study developed a quantitative model to predict organ
   dose for clinical chest and abdominopelvic scans. Such information may
   aid in the design of optimized CT protocols in relation to a targeted
   level of image quality. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and shear wave elasticity
   imaging (SWEI) use the dynamic response of tissue to impulsive
   mechanical stimulus to characterize local elasticity. A variant of
   conventional, multiple-track-location SWEI, denoted
   single-track-location SWEI, offers the promise of creating speckle-free
   shear wave images. This work compares the three imaging modalities using
   a high push and track beam density combined acquisition sequence to
   image inclusions of different sizes and contrasts. Single-track-location
   SWEI is found to have a significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio
   than multiple-track-location SWEI, allowing for operation at higher
   resolution. Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and
   single-track-location SWEI perform similarly in the larger inclusions,
   with single-track-location SWEI providing better visualization of small
   targets <= 2.5 mm in diameter. The processing of each modality
   introduces different trade-offs between smoothness and resolution of
   edges and structures; these are discussed in detail. (C) 2015 World

Abstract = {{We present a fully automatic algorithm to identify fluid-filled regions

   classification estimates as a guide to more accurately segment the
   retinal layer boundaries using our previously described graph theory and
   dynamic programming (GTDP) framework. We validated our algorithm on 110
   B-scans from ten patients with severe DME pathology, showing an overall
   mean Dice coefficient of 0.78 when comparing our KR + GTDP algorithm to
   an expert grader. This is comparable to the inter-observer Dice
   coefficient of 0.79. The entire data set is available online, including
   our automatic and manual segmentation results. To the best of our

Abstract = {{We present a high-performance and real-time production scheduling
   algorithm for digital print production based on a dynamic incremental
   evolutionary algorithm. The optimization objective is to prioritize the
   dispatching sequence of orders and balance resource utilization. The
   scheduler is scalable for realistic problem instances and it provides
   solutions quickly for diverse print products that require complex
   fulfillment procedures. Furthermore, it dynamically ingests the
   transient state of the factory, such as process information and resource
   failure probability in print production; therefore, it minimizes the
   management-production mismatch. Discrete-event simulation results show
   that the production scheduler leads to a higher and more stable order
   on-time delivery ratio compared to a rule-based heuristic. Its
   beneficial attributes collectively contribute to the reduction or
   elimination of the shortcomings that are inherent in today's digital
   printing environment and help to enhance a print factory's productivity
   and profitability.
   Note to Practitioners-In recent years, the diversity of print orders has
   increased in many dimensions due to mass customization. For instance,
   large variations are seen in the product types involved in an order, the
   size of an order, print quality requirement, and even the order due
   date. The factory status, which is measured by attributes such as
   resource utilization, work-in-progress, and resource
   availability/downtime, is also highly dynamic. The challenge of
   real-time scheduling for high volume of diverse orders limits print
   factory performance today. Our production scheduler considers stochastic
   factors that influence the on-time delivery of an order. It prioritizes
   orders and allocates resources for manufacturing. Such a dynamic
   production scheduler will therefore be invaluable for a realistic print
   factory that suffers from error-prone manufacturing processes, includes
   complex production procedures, and requires high on-time delivery ratio
   of orders.}},

Abstract = {{Within industrial automation systems, three-dimensional (3-D) vision
   provides very useful feedback information in autonomous operation of
   various manufacturing equipment (e.g., industrial robots, material
   handling devices, assembly systems, and machine tools). The hardware
   performance in contemporary 3-D scanning devices is suitable for online
   utilization. However, the bottleneck is the lack of real-time algorithms
   for recognition of geometric primitives (e.g., planes and natural
   quadrics) from a scanned point cloud. One of the most important and the
   most frequent geometric primitive in various engineering tasks is plane.
   In this paper, we propose a new fast one-pass algorithm for recognition
   (segmentation and fitting) of planar segments from a point cloud. To
   effectively segment planar regions, we exploit the orthonormality of
   certain wavelets to polynomial function, as well as their sensitivity to
   abrupt changes. After segmentation of planar regions, we estimate the
   parameters of corresponding planes using standard fitting procedures.
   For point cloud structuring, a z-buffer algorithm with mesh triangles
   representation in barycentric coordinates is employed. The proposed
   recognition method is tested and experimentally validated in several
   real-world case studies.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To compare choroidal thickness in patients with intermediate or
   advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and control subjects
   using enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).
   DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study of 325 eyes from 164
   subjects who underwent EDI-OCT for the Age-Related Eye Disease Study
   (AREDS) 2 Ancillary Spectral Domain OCT study.
   METHODS: Choroidal thickness was measured by semiautomated segmentation
   of EDI-OCT images from 1.5 mm nasal to 1.5 mm temporal to the fovea.
   Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the association of
   subfoveal choroidal thickness or average choroidal thickness across the
   central 3-mm segment with systemic and ocular variables. Choroidal
   thickness measurements were compared between eyes with no AMD (n = 154)
   (ie, controls), intermediate A/vfD (n = 109), and advanced AMD (n = 62).
   ``
   RESULTS: Both subfoveal and average chorciidal thicknesses were
   associated with age (P < .001) and refractive error (P < .001), but not
   other variables tested. Mean average choroidal thickness was
   significantly reduced in advanced AMD as compared with control eyes (P
   =.008), with no significant difference between advanced and intermediate
   AMD eyes (P = .152) or between intermediate AMD and control eyes (P =
   .098). Choroidal thinning was also noted from 1.5 mm nasal to 1.5 mm
   temporal to the fovea when comparing advanced AIYID with control eyes (P
   < .05 at all 0.5 mm interval locations). After adjustment for age and
   refractive error, however, there was no significant difference in
   subfoveal (P = .675) or average choroidal thickness (P = .746) across
   all 3 groups. ``
   CONCLUSIONS: When adjusted for age and refractive error, central
   choroidal thickness may not be significantly influenced by AMD status
   based on AREDS categorization. (C) 2015 by Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To measure average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses
   in healthy, full-term neonates.
   DESIGN: Descriptive research to develop normative data.
   METHODS: Healthy infants born between 37 and 42 weeks postmenstrual age
   were imaged with hand-held spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.
   A custom script segmented the RNFL; the fovea and optic nerve center
   were manually selected. A second script measured the average RNFL
   thickness along the papillo-macular bundle, defined as the arc from -15
   degrees to + 15 degrees on the axis from the optic nerve to fovea, with
   radii of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7 mm from the center of the optic disc.
   Shapiro-Wilk W tests assessed these measurements for normality to
   determine the age-appropriate radial distance for subsequent analyses.
   Average RNFL thicknesses for four temporal 45-degree sectors (superior
   temporal, temporal superior, temporal inferior, and inferior temporal)
   and the temporal quadrant were calculated and compared to demographic
   parameters for all infants.
   RESULTS: Fifty full-term infants were adequately imaged for RNFL
   analysis. RNFL thicknesses at 1.5 mm radial distance from the optic
   nerve were the most normally distributed. While there was a trend toward
   greater mean superior temporal RNFL thickness for both black and
   Hispanic vs white infants (128 +/- 27 mu m, 124 +/- 30 mu m, and 100 +/-
   19 mu m, respectively, P = .04 for both comparisons), there were no
   other significant differences noted in RNFL thicknesses by race, sex,
   gestational age, or birth weight.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present RNFL thickness measurements for healthy,
   full-term infants that may serve as normative data for future analyses.

Abstract = {{Huancavelica, Peru, a historic cinnabar refining site, is one of the
   most mercury (Hg)-contaminated urban areas in the world. Exposure is
   amplified because residents build their adobe brick homes from
   contaminated soil. The objectives of this study were to compare two
   Hg-leaching procedures, and their application as risk-assessment
   screening tools in Hg-contaminated adobe brick homes in Huancavelica.
   The purpose was to evaluate potential health implications, particularly
   for children, after ingestion of Hg-contaminated particles. Hg was
   measured in adobe brick and dirt floor samples from 60 households by
   total Hg extraction, simulated gastric fluid (GF) extraction, and
   sequential selective extraction (SSE), which provides more detailed data
   but is resource-intensive. Most of the Hg present in samples was
   relatively insoluble, although in some households soluble Hg species
   were present at concentrations that may be of concern after ingestion. A
   strong correlation was identified between results from simulated GF
   extraction of adobe bricks and dirt floors and the more soluble
   fractions of Hg from SSE. Simulated GF extraction data were combined
   with ingestion and body mass characteristics for small children to
   compare potential risk of ingestion of Hg-contaminated soil with current
   health standards. Simulated GF extraction can be used as a risk
   assessment screening tool for effective allocation of time and resources
   to households that have measurable concentrations of bioaccessible Hg.
   Combining simulated GF extraction data with health standards enables
   intervention strategies targeted at households with the greatest
   potential health threat from ingestion of Hg-contaminated particles.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) is used in system-on-chips
   (SoCs) for power management, but it increases test time because every
   core must be tested at multiple voltage settings. In addition, testing
   at lower power supply voltage settings increases the length of each test
   due to the corresponding reduction in frequencies that can be used for
   scan shift operations. Existing test scheduling techniques do not
   consider test applications at multiple voltage settings, therefore they
   are not effective for reducing test time for DVFS-based SoCs. We propose
   a time-division multiplexing (TDM) architecture, which uses the highest
   available frequency for shifting test data into the SoC and then
   distributes the test data into multiple cores using lower shift
   frequencies. TDM is accompanied by three test scheduling methods, which
   are suitable for different scenarios: 1) an integer linear
   programming-based formulation that offers optimal results for SOCs of
   moderate size; 2) a greedy approach that provides good results with very
   short run time even for very large SoCs; and 3) a rectangle-packing
   approach combined with simulated-annealing that offers a trade-off
   between run time and test-time reduction for all SoCs. Experimental
   results on two industrial SoCs highlight the effectiveness of TDM and
   the associated scheduling methods.}},

   Design: Evaluation of a diagnostic test or technology in a cohort.
   Subjects: A total of 70 eyes from 37 subjects undergoing LASIK were
   measured preoperatively. A total of 39 eyes from 22 subjects were
   measured postoperatively and completed the study.
   Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing LASIK at the Duke Eye Center
   who consented to participate were imaged with Placido-ring topography,
   Scheimpflug photography, and OCT on the day of their surgery. Patients
   were then reimaged with the same imaging systems at the postoperative
   month 3 visit. Change in preoperative to postoperative corneal
   refractive power as measured by each of the imaging modalities was
   compared with the preoperative to postoperative change in manifest
   refraction (MRx) using the t test with generalized estimating equations.
   Main Outcome Measures: Corneal refractive power change due to LASIK as
   measured by Placido-ring topography, Scheimpflug photography, and OCT
   compared with the MRx change vertexed to the corneal plane. The change
   in MRx should correspond to the change in the corneal refractive power
   from LASIK and was considered the reference measurement.
   Results: In 22 individuals (39 eyes) returning after LASIK, we found no
   significant difference between the clinically measured pre- to
   post-LASIK change in MRx and both Scheimpflug photography (P = 0.714)
   and OCT (P = 0.216). In contrast, keratometry values from Placido-ring
   topography were found to be significantly different from the measured
   refractive change (P < 0.001). In addition, of the 3 imaging modalities,
   OCT recorded the smallest mean absolute difference from the reference
   measurement with the least amount of variability.
   Conclusions: Motion-corrected OCT more accurately measures the change in
   corneal refractive power due to laser refractive surgery than other
   currently available clinical devices. By offering accurate corneal
   refractive power measurements in normal and surgically modified
   subjects, OCT offers a compelling alternative to current clinical
   devices for determining corneal refractive power. (C) 2015 by the

Abstract = {{The limited regenerative capacity of articular cartilage contributes to
   progressive joint dysfunction associated with cartilage injury or
   osteoarthritis. Cartilage tissue engineering seeks to provide a
   biological substitute for repairing damaged or diseased cartilage, but
   requires a cell source with the capacity for extensive expansion without
   loss of chondrogenic potential. In this study, we hypothesized that
   decreased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 would enhance the
   proliferative and chondrogenic potential of differentiated induced
   pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Murine iPSCs were directed to
   differentiate toward the chondrogenic lineage with an established
   protocol and then engineered to express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to
   reduce the expression of p21. Cells expressing the p21 shRNA
   demonstrated higher proliferative potential during monolayer expansion
   and increased synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in pellet cultures.
   Furthermore, these cells could be expanded similar to 150-fold over
   three additional passages without a reduction in the subsequent
   production of GAGs, while control cells showed reduced potential for GAG
   synthesis with three additional passages. In pellets from extensively
   passaged cells, knockdown of p21 attenuated the sharp decrease in cell
   number that occurred in control cells, and immunohistochemical analysis
   showed that p21 knockdown limited the production of type I and type X
   collagen while maintaining synthesis of cartilage-specific type II
   collagen. These findings suggest that manipulating the cell cycle can
   augment the monolayer expansion and preserve the chondrogenic capacity
   of differentiated iPSCs, providing a strategy for enhancing iPSC-based
   cartilage tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a compact printed Vivaldi antenna with two symmetrical
   extended ground plane stubs is presented. By extending the stubs from
   the ground plane, the low-end bandwidth limitation of the antenna is
   extended to low frequencies and then the bandwidth is enlarged. To
   validate the proposed design, an antenna prototype is fabricated and
   tested. The measured results confirm that the modification presented in
   this letter is very effective without changing the overall dimensions of
   the antenna. The measured impedance bandwidth defined by S-11<-10 dB is
   from 2.45 to 15.2 GHz with a ratio of about 6.2:1. The measured gain is
   better than 4.2 dBi within the operating frequency band. In addition, a
   nearly constant group time delay is also achieved across the band of
   2.4-16 GHz. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett

Abstract = {{The interest in plasmonic technologies surrounds many emergent
   optoelectronic applications, such as plasmon lasers, transistors,
   sensors and information storage. Although plasmonic materials for
   ultraviolet-visible and near-infrared wavelengths have been found, the
   mid-infrared range remains a challenge to address: few known systems can
   achieve subwavelength optical confinement with low loss in this range.
   With a combination of experiments and ab initio modelling, here we
   demonstrate an extreme peak of electron mobility in Dy-doped CdO that is
   achieved through accurate `defect equilibrium engineering'. In so doing,
   we create a tunable plasmon host that satisfies the criteria for
   mid-infrared spectrum plasmonics, and overcomes the losses seen in
   conventional plasmonic materials. In particular, extrinsic doping pins
   the CdO Fermi level above the conduction band minimum and it increases
   the formation energy of native oxygen vacancies, thus reducing their
   populations by several orders of magnitude. The substitutional lattice
   strain induced by Dy doping is sufficiently small, allowing mobility
   values around 500 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for carrier densities above 10(20)
   cm(3). Our work shows that CdO: Dy is a model system for intrinsic and
   extrinsic manipulation of defects affecting electrical, optical and
   thermal properties, that oxide conductors are ideal candidates for
   plasmonic devices and that the defect engineering approach for property
   optimization is generally applicable to other conducting metal oxides.}},

Abstract = {{The use of nano-enabled materials in industry and consumer products is
   increasing rapidly and with it, the more imperative it becomes to
   understand the consequences of such materials entering the environment
   during production, use or disposal. The novel properties of engineered
   nanomaterials (ENMs) that make them desirable for commercial
   applications also present the possibility of impacting aquatic and
   terrestrial environments in ways that may differ from materials in bulk
   format. Modeling techniques are needed to proactively predict the
   environmental fate and transport of nanomaterials.
   A model for nanopartide (NP) separation and transformation in water
   treatment was parameterized for three metal and metal-oxide NPs.
   Functional assays to determine NP specific distribution and
   transformation were used to parameterize the model and obtain
   environmentally relevant concentrations of NPs and transformation
   byproducts leaving WWTPs in effluent and biosolids. All three NPs were
   predicted to associate >90\% with the solid phase indicating significant
   accumulation in the biosolids. High rates of transformation for ZnO and
   Ag NPs resulted in similar to 97\% transformation of the NPs that enter
   the plant despite differences in transformation rate in aerobic versus
   anaerobic environments. Due to high insolubility and negligible redox
   transformation, the only process predicted to impact TiO2 NP fate and
   transport in WWTPs was distribution between the solid and liquid phases.
   Subsequent investigation of ZnO NP species fate and transport when land
   applied in biosolids indicated that steady state concentrations of ZnO
   phases would likely be achieved after approximately 150 days under
   loading conditions of biosolids typical in current practice. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Here we document the effect of flow configuration on the heat transfer
   performance of a helically shaped pipe embedded in a cylindrical
   conducting volume. The helix is wrapped on an imaginary cylinder.
   Several configurations of helices with fixed volume of fluid are
   considered. We found the optimal spacings between the helical turns such
   that the volumetric heat transfer rate is maximal. Next, we extended the
   study by varying the volume (length) of the embedded pipe. We found that
   the optimized features of the heat transfer architecture are robust with
   respect to changes in several physical parameters. We compared the
   performance for both helical 3D and 20 designs. We found that the 2D
   designs offer greater heat transfer density than the 3D designs. (C)

Abstract = {{Fetal scanning is one of the most common applications of ultrasound
   imaging and serves as a source of vital information about maternal and
   fetal health. Visualization of clinically relevant structures, however,
   can be severely compromised in difficult-to-image patients due to poor
   resolution and the presence of high levels of acoustical noise or
   clutter. We have developed novel coherence-based beamforming methods
   called Short-Lag Spatial Coherence (SLSC) imaging and Harmonic Spatial
   Coherence imaging (HSCI), and applied them to suppress the effects of
   clutter in fetal imaging. This method is used to create images of the
   spatial coherence of the backscattered ultrasound as opposed to images
   of echo magnitude. We present the results of a patient study to assess
   the benefits of coherence-based beamforming in the context of first
   trimester fetal exams. Matched fundamental B-mode, SLSC, harmonic
   B-mode, and HSCI images were generated using raw radio frequency data
   collected on 11 volunteers in the first trimester of pregnancy. The
   images were compared for qualitative differences in image texture and
   target conspicuity as well as using quantitative imaging metrics such as
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and
   contrast. SLSC and HSCI showed statistically significant improvements
   across all imaging metrics compared with B-mode and harmonic B-mode,
   respectively. These improvements were greatest for poor quality B-mode
   images where contrast of anechoic targets was improved from 15 dB in
   fundamental B-mode to 27 dB in SLSC and 17 dB in harmonic B-mode to 30
   dB in HSCI. CNR improved from 1.4 to 2.5 in the fundamental images and
   1.4 to 3.1 in the harmonic case. These results exhibit the potential of
   coherence-based beamforming to improve image quality and target
   detectability, especially in high noise environments.}},

   backprojecting the spectrum of the radar echo into the image wavenumber

   handling a general aperture geometry. From each reconstructed spectral
   pixel, information about the entire scene can be obtained, allowing the
   formation of interim lower resolution images during the processing. In
   addition, the method allows for an arbitrary sampling of the image
   spectrum. It forms SAR images by backprojecting the spectrum of the
   radar echo into the image wavenumber domain. Processing of simulated and
   experimental ultrawideband/widebeam SAR raw data demonstrates the
   efficacy of this new method.}},

Abstract = {{Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have previously been successfully applied to
   subsurface threat detection using ground penetrating radar (GPR) data.
   However, parameter estimation in most HMM-based landmine detection
   approaches is difficult since object locations are typically well known
   for the 2-D coordinates on the Earth's surface but are not well known
   for object depths underneath the ground/time of arrival in a GPR A-scan.
   As a result, in a standard expectation maximization HMM(EM-HMM), all
   depths corresponding to a particular alarm location may be labeled as
   target sequences although the characteristics of data from different
   depths are substantially different. In this paper, an alternate HMM
   approach is developed using a multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework
   that considers an unordered set of HMM sequences at a particular alarm
   location, where the set of sequences is defined as positive if at least
   one of the sequences is a target sequence; otherwise, the set is defined
   as negative. Using the MIL framework, a collection of these sets (bags),
   along with their labels is used to train the target and nontarget HMMs
   simultaneously. The model parameters are inferred using variational
   Bayes, making the model tractable and computationally efficient.
   Experimental results on two synthetic and two landmine data sets show
   that the proposed approach performs better than a standard EM-HMM.}},

Abstract = {{Condensers are flow architectures needed to provide high rates of
   condensation (or cooling) per unit volume, in enclosures with fixed
   volume. Their design has not changed from configurations consisting of
   the banks of horizontal tubes. In this paper, we outline a free path to
   evolving the design by exploring new features of flow configuration:
   flattened tubes, multiple tube sizes, arrays of flattened tubes,
   vertical tubes with turbulent film flow, forced convection condensation
   instead of gravity driven condensation, and the optimal length of a
   horizontal tube, i.e., the number of tubes in a column aligned with
   vapor cross flow. We show that the condensation density can be increased
   sizably by varying freely and without bias the morphology of the flow
   system: the shapes and arrangement of the cooled surfaces on which
   condensation occurs. The evolution of technology is described in terms
   of the special time direction of the useful (purposeful) changes in the
   configuration (shapes, arrangements) of surfaces on which
   flow/condensation occurs. This explains what ``evolution{''} means. It
   is an important step for physics, not just technology. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{The elastic constant tensor of an inorganic compound provides a complete
   description of the response of the material to external stresses in the
   elastic limit. It thus provides fundamental insight into the nature of
   the bonding in the material, and it is known to correlate with many

   tensor, it has been measured for a very small fraction of all known
   inorganic compounds, a situation that limits the ability of materials
   scientists to develop new materials with targeted mechanical responses.
   To address this deficiency, we present here the largest database of
   calculated elastic properties for inorganic compounds to date. The
   database currently contains full elastic information for 1,181 inorganic
   compounds, and this number is growing steadily. The methods used to
   develop the database are described, as are results of tests that
   establish the accuracy of the data. In addition, we document the

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the fundamental relation that exists between the
   configuration of a three-dimensional living space and the time needed
   for the evacuation of all the inhabitants. The evacuation is treated as
   a physical flow system consisting of pedestrians who move from a volume
   to one or two exits. The living space has two variable aspect ratios,
   the floor shape and the profile shape (or the number of floors). First,
   the paper reports analytically the optimal floor and profile shapes for
   which the total evacuation time is minimum. Second, the analytical
   results are complemented and validated by numerical results obtained
   based on numerous simulations of pedestrian flow from volume to exits.
   The numerical results are further validated by performing the
   simulations of pedestrian movement with two different computational
   codes (Simulex and FDS + Evac). The fundamental relation presented in
   this paper can be used in the design of larger and more complex living
   spaces in modern urban settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Second-order PML: Optimal choice of nth-order PML for truncating FDTD
   domains}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{285}},
Pages = {{71-83}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The nth-order PMLs based on the unsplit-field formulations and the
   Z-transform methods are proposed to truncate the finite-difference
   time-domain (FDTD) domains, which will be validated through numerical
   simulations whether the higher-order PML with more than two poles, such
   as n = 3, will hold better absorption performance as compared with the
   conventional, complex frequency shifted (CFS), second-order perfectly
   matched layer (PMLs). The advantages and disadvantages of different PMLs
   are demonstrated. It has shown that the higher-order PMLs have the
   advantages of both the conventional and the CFS PMLs in terms of
   absorption performance, since the conventional PML is ineffective at
   absorbing the evanescent waves and the CFS-PML is incapable of absorbing
   low-frequency propagating waves. It is clearly shown that the
   second-order PML is overall the optimal choice for truncating arbitrary
   FDTD domains, since it not only requires less computational time and
   memory, but holds almost the same absorption performance as compared
   with the third-order PML. Three numerical simulations have been carried
   out in three-dimensional (3D) problems to confirm the analysis. (C) 2015

Title = {{A three-dimensional phase diagram of growth-induced surface
   instabilities}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{A variety of fascinating morphological patterns arise on surfaces of
   growing, developing or aging tissues, organs and microorganism colonies.
   These patterns can be classified into creases, wrinkles, folds,
   period-doubles, ridges and delaminated-buckles according to their
   distinctive topographical characteristics. One universal mechanism for
   the pattern formation has been long believed to be the mismatch strains
   between biological layers with different expanding or shrinking rates,
   which induce mechanical instabilities. However, a general model that
   accounts for the formation and evolution of these various
   surface-instability patterns still does not exist. Here, we take
   biological structures at their current states as thermodynamic systems,
   treat each instability pattern as a thermodynamic phase, and construct a
   unified phase diagram that can quantitatively predict various types of
   growth-induced surface instabilities. We further validate the phase
   diagram with our experiments on surface instabilities induced by
   mismatch strains as well as the reported data on growth-induced
   instabilities in various biological systems. The predicted wavelengths
   and amplitudes of various instability patterns match well with our
   experimental data. It is expected that the unified phase diagram will
   not only advance the understanding of biological morphogenesis, but also
   significantly facilitate the design of new materials and structures by
   rationally harnessing surface instabilities.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{368}},
Pages = {{83-94}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis functions as an
   endogenous circadian rhythm coupled to external environmental forcings
   of energy and water availability. This paper explores the nonlinear
   dynamics of a new CAM photosynthesis model (Bartlett et al., 2014) and
   investigates the responses of CAM plant carbon assimilation to different
   combinations of environmental conditions. The CAM model (Bartlett et
   al., 2014) consists of a Calvin cycle typical of C3 plants coupled to an
   oscillator of the type employed in the Van der Pol and FitzHugh-Nagumo
   systems. This coupled system is a function of environmental variables
   including leaf temperature, leaf moisture potential, and irradiance.
   Here, we explore the qualitative response of the system and the expected
   carbon assimilation under constant and periodically forced environmental
   conditions. The model results show how the diurnal evolution of these
   variables entrains the CAM cycle with prevailing environmental
   conditions. While constant environmental conditions generate either
   steady-state or periodically oscillating responses in malic acid uptake
   and release, forcing the CAM system with periodic daily fluctuations in
   light exposure and leaf temperature results in quasi-periodicity and
   possible chaos for certain ranges of these variables. This analysis is a
   first step in quantifying changes in CAM plant productivity with
   variables such as the mean temperature, daily temperature range,
   irradiance, and leaf moisture potential. Results may also be used to
   inform model parametrization based on the observed fluctuating regime.

   Path of a Shock-Wave Lithotripter}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{It is hypothesized that the decreased treatment efficiency in
   contemporary shock-wave lithotripters is related to tensile wave
   attenuation due to cavitation in the prefocal beam path. Utilizing
   high-speed imaging of the beam path and focal pressure waveform
   measurements, tensile attenuation is associated with bubble
   proliferation. By systematically testing different combinations of
   pulse-repetition frequency and gas concentration, we modulate the
   bubble-dissolution time to identify which conditions lead to bubble
   proliferation and show that reducing bubble proliferation in the beam
   path significantly improves acoustic transmission and stone comminution
   efficiency in vitro. In addition to experiments, a bubble-proliferation
   model is developed that takes gas diffusion across the bubble wall and
   bubble fragmentation into account. By aligning the model with
   experimental observations, the number of daughter bubbles produced after
   a single lithotripter bubble collapse is estimated to be in the range of
   253 similar to 510. This finding is on the same order of magnitude with
   previous measurements of an isolated bubble collapse in a lithotripter
   field by Pishchalnikov, McAteer, and Williams {[}BJU Int. 102, 1681
   (2008)], and this estimate improves the general understanding of
   lithotripsy bubble dynamics in the beam path.}},

Abstract = {{Pilot scale studies were performed to investigate how CNTs might affect
   hollow fiber membrane (HF) resistance to stress. Further, this research
   explored how the addition of CNTs into membrane solutions affected
   trends associated with changes in conventional HF spinning parameters.
   Nanocomposite polymer solutions were formed by adding functionalized
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (0.2 wt.\%, 0.4 wt.\% and 0.8
   wt.\%) and PES. Membranes were fabricated under three different air
   residence times (1.875 s,0.935 s, and 0 s) by changing either the air
   gap (15 cm or 0 cm) or the fiber take-up speed (0.16 m/s or 0.08 m/s).
   Subsequently, HF membranes were characterized according to their
   porosity, permeability, contact angle, and tensile strength. As
   expected, stress resistance and Young's Modulus increased up to 125\%
   and 118\% for certain membranes containing CNTs, respectively. Shorter
   air residence times caused significant porosity increases and large

Abstract = {{In this paper, by employing the symmetric autocorrelation function and

   algorithm is proposed for high-speed targets. This coherent detection
   algorithm is simple and can be easily implemented by using complex
   multiplications, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT
   (IFFT). Compared to the Hough transform and the keystone transform, this
   coherent detection algorithm can detect high-speed targets without the
   brute-force searching of unknown motion parameters and achieve a good
   balance between the computational cost and the antinoise performance.
   Through simulations and analyses for synthetic models and the real data,
   we verify the effectiveness of the proposed coherent detection

Abstract = {{The aeroelastic stability of rectangular plates in subsonic flow is well
   documented in literature. For example, the stability of a cantilever
   plate with a clamped edge parallel to the flow is well understood due to
   the similarity of this system to an aircraft wing. However, an ongoing
   push for lighter aerospace structures and novel designs requires
   advancing the understanding of the aeroelastic stability of plates with
   nonconventional boundary condition combinations. This paper summarizes
   the aeroelastic theory and experimental results on the flutter and/or
   divergence mechanisms of a rectangular plate with different sets of
   structural boundary conditions. The theory combines a linear plate
   structural model with a three-dimensional vortex lattice aerodynamic
   mode to create a high-fidelity frequency domain aeroelastic model. The
   paper also discusses the development of a modular experimental test bed
   to test the different boundary conditions. Apair of well-understood
   boundary condition configurations acts as validation points, and then
   results of additional configurations that have not been extensively
   explored are presented. The results of this paper can be used to support
   the design efforts of projects involving plates or plate membranes. In
   addition, the paper adds to the fundamental understanding of plate
   aeroelasticity and provides experimental data for comparison and future
   validation.}},

Abstract = {{The lock-in amplifier is a critical component in many different types of

   With this application in mind, we present here the design and

   field-programmable gate array (FPGA) coprocessor of a data acquisition
   board. The most important advantage is the inherent ability to filter
   signals based on more complex modulation patterns. As an example, we use
   the flexibility of the FPGA approach to enable a novel pump-probe

Abstract = {{In this paper, performance of grid computing environment is studied in
   the presence of failure-repair of the resources. To achieve this, in the
   first step, each of the grid resource is individually modeled using
   Stochastic Reward Nets (SRNs), and mean response time of the resource
   for grid tasks is computed as a performance measure. In individual
   models, three different scheduling schemes called random selection,
   non-preemptive priority, and preemptive priority are considered to
   simultaneously schedule local and grid tasks to the processors of a
   single resource. In the next step, single resource models are combined
   to shape an entire grid environment. Since the number of the resources
   in a large-scale grid environment is more than can be handled using such
   a monolithic SRN, two approximate SRN models using folding and
   fixed-point techniques are proposed to evaluate the performance of the
   whole grid environment. Brouwer's fixed-point theorem is used to
   theoretically prove the existence of a solution to the fixed-point
   approximate model. Numerical results indicate an improvement of several
   orders of magnitude in the model state space reduction without a
   significant loss of accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To create and validate software to automatically segment
   leakage area in real-world clinical fluorescein angiography (FA) images
   of subjects with diabetic macular edema (DME).
   METHODS. Fluorescein angiography images obtained from 24 eyes of 24
   subjects with DME were retrospectively analyzed. Both video and
   still-frame images were obtained using a Heidelberg Spectralis 6-mode
   HRA/OCT unit. We aligned early and late FA frames in the video by a
   two-step nonrigid registration method. To remove background artifacts,
   we subtracted early and late FA frames. Finally, after postprocessing
   steps, including detection and inpainting of the vessels, a robust
   active contour method was utilized to obtain leakage area in a 1500-mu
   m-radius circular region centered at the fovea. Images were captured at
   different fields of view (FOVs) and were often contaminated with
   outliers, as is the case in real-world clinical imaging. Our algorithm
   was applied to these images with no manual input. Separately, all images
   were manually segmented by two retina specialists. The sensitivity,
   specificity, and accuracy of manual interobserver, manual intraobserver,
   and automatic methods were calculated.
   RESULTS. The mean accuracy was 0.86 +/- 0.08 for automatic versus
   manual, 0.83 +/- 0.16 for manual interobserver, and 0.90 +/- 0.08 for
   manual intraobserver segmentation methods.
   CONCLUSIONS. Our fully automated algorithm can reproducibly and
   accurately quantify the area of leakage of clinical-grade FA video and
   is congruent with expert manual segmentation. The performance was
   reliable for different DME subtypes. This approach has the potential to
   reduce time and labor costs and may yield objective and reproducible
   quantitative measurements of DME imaging biomarkers.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave-induced thermoacoustic tomography (MITAT) is a hybrid method
   which constructs images with ultrasound spatial resolution while
   exploiting dielectric contrast at microwave frequency. It has great
   potential in biomedical imaging especially in early breast cancer
   detection. The detection of early stage breast tumor in MITAT is
   challenged by the moderate endogenous dielectric contrast between
   malignant and healthy glandular tissues. In order to overcome this
   limitation, the performance of using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as an
   imaging contrast enhancement agent is evaluated. First, the influences
   in dielectric and acoustic properties caused by CNTs are measured.
   Second, based on the measurements and the published data, numerical
   breast phantom is created and then used to explore the contrast
   enhancing effect of CNTs for MITAT, by an integrated simulation approach
   in both electromagnetic and acoustic field. With an experimental MITAT
   system, the thermoacoustic responses of tissue mimicking materials with
   different CNTs concentrations are also quantitatively investigated.
   Finally, the effectiveness of the contrast agent is also validated
   experimentally by using a MITAT system. The results show that the using
   of the dielectric contrast agent can effectively enhance the contrast of
   the MITAT image.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate predictions of both process-execution time and process status
   are crucial for the development of an intelligent enterprise information
   system (EIS). We have developed new automated learning-based
   process-execution time-prediction and process status-prediction methods
   that can be embedded into an EIS. Process-execution time prediction is a
   regression problem and state-of-the-art (baseline) time-prediction
   methods use a machine-learning regression model. Process status
   prediction is a binary classification problem in which a class labeled
   ``completed{''} or ``in-progress{''} is assigned to a process with
   respect to an arbitrary predictive horizon (i.e., the future time given
   by the method user). The methods proposed in this paper integrate
   statistical methods with support-vector regression. Comparison results
   obtained from the real data of a digital-print enterprise show that the
   proposed time-prediction method reduces both the relative mean error and
   the root-mean-squared error of the regression model. Furthermore, the
   proposed status-prediction method not only achieves higher
   classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, it also estimates
   the probability of the predicted status. In addition, algorithm
   development and training phases of the proposed methods do not rely on
   any arbitrary predictive horizon. Therefore, a single time-prediction
   model as proposed is sufficient for status prediction as opposed to a
   baseline status-prediction method that requires classification models
   for all potential predictive horizons.}},

Abstract = {{Juvenile nucleus pulposus (NP) cells of the intervertebral disc (IVD)
   are large, vacuolated cells that form cell clusters with strong
   cell-cell interactions. With maturation and aging, NP cells lose their
   ability to form these cell clusters, with aging-associated changes in NP
   cell phenotype, morphology, and proteoglycan synthesis that may
   contribute to IVD degeneration. Therefore, it is important to understand
   the mechanisms governing juvenile NP cell cluster behavior towards the
   goal of revealing factors that can promote juvenile, healthy NP cell
   phenotypes. N-cadherin has been identified as a cell-cell adhesion
   marker that is present in juvenile NP cells, but disappears with age.
   The goal of this study was to reveal the importance of N-cadherin in
   regulating cell-cell interactions in juvenile NP cell cluster formation
   and test for a regulatory role in maintaining a juvenile NP phenotype in
   vitro. Juvenile porcine IVD cells, of notochordal origin, were promoted
   to form cell clusters in vitro, and analyzed for preservation of the
   juvenile NP phenotype. Additionally, cadherin-blocking experiments were
   performed to prevent cluster formation in order to study the importance
   of cluster formation in NP cell signaling. Findings reveal
   N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts promote cell clustering behavior
   and regulate NP cell matrix production and preservation of NP-specific
   markers. Inhibition of N-cadherin-mediated contacts resulted in loss of
   all features of the juvenile NP cell. These results establish a
   regulatory role for N-cadherin in juvenile NP cells, and suggest that
   preservation of the N-cadherin mediated cell-cell contact is important
   for preserving juvenile NP cell phenotype and morphology.}},

Title = {{Endothelial Cell Senescence Increases Traction Forces due to

Journal = {{CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-75}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Endothelial cell (EC) aging and senescence are key events in
   atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease development. Age-associated
   changes in the local mechanical environment of blood vessels have also
   been linked to atherosclerosis. However, the extent to which cell
   senescence affects mechanical forces generated by the cell is unclear.
   In this study, we sought to determine whether EC senescence increases
   traction forces through age-associated changes in the glycocalyx and
   antioxidant regulator deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), which is
   downregulated during aging. Traction forces were higher in cells that
   had undergone more population doublings and changes in traction force
   were associated with altered actin localization. Older cells also had
   increased actin filament thickness. Depletion of heparan sulfate in
   young ECs elevated traction forces and actin filament thickness, while
   addition of heparan sulfate to the surface of aged ECs by treatment with
   angiopoietin-1 had the opposite effect. While inhibition of SIRT1 had no
   significant effect on traction forces or actin organization for young
   cells, activation of SIRT1 did reduce traction forces and increase
   peripheral actin in aged ECs. These results show that EC senescence
   increases traction forces and alters actin localization through changes
   to SIRT1 and the glycocalyx.}},

Volume = {{132}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aqueous humor (AH) is a dynamic intraocular fluid that supports the
   vitality of tissues that regulate intraocular pressure. We recently
   discovered that extracellular nanovesicles called exosomes are a major
   constituent of AH. Exosomes function in extracellular communication and
   contain proteins and small RNA. Our goal was to characterize the
   physical properties of AH exosomes and their exosomal RNA (esRNA)
   content. We isolated exosomes from human AH collected during cataract
   surgery from five patients using serial ultracentrifugation. We measured
   the size and concentration of AH exosomes in solution using nanoparticle
   tracking analysis. We found a single population of vesicles having a
   mean size of 121 +/- 11 nm in the unprocessed Aft Data show that
   centrifugation does not significantly affect the mean particle size (121
   +/- 11 nm versus 124 +/- 21 nm), but does impact the final number of
   exosomes in solution (87\% loss from the unprocessed AH; n = 5). We
   extracted esRNA from the pooled human AH samples using miRCURY RNA
   isolation kit from Exiqon. The quality of extracted esRNA was evaluated
   using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and was used to generate a sequencing
   library for small RNA sequencing with Illumina MiSeq sequencer. More
   than 10 different miRNAs were identified; abundant species included
   miR-486-5p, miR-204, and miR-184. We found that the majority of
   extracellular vesicles in the AH were in the exosome size range,
   suggesting that miRNAs housed within exosomes may function in
   communication between AH inflow and outflow tissues. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{While terahertz (THz) communication systems, operating from 100 GHz to 1
   THz, have the potential to exploit wide swaths of unused spectrum for
   ultra-high bitrate communication, there are significant challenges.
   Particularly, the strong absorption of water vapor can result in very
   high atmospheric attenuation. We modeled a ground to geostationary
   satellite link and found that using large aperture THz stations,
   patterned after the 12.5 m Atacama Large Microwave Array dish and the
   3.5 m Herschel Space Observatory optics, worst 10th percentile data
   rates in excess of one terabit per second in the THz bands are possible.
   The key is to site ground stations in dry regions. We locate these by
   coupling our link model, which selects optimum modulation and carrier
   bandwidth, with global, high-resolution satellite water vapor
   measurements. We present detailed maps showing modeled link performance
   over the surface of the Earth. Smaller apertures on aircraft and
   balloons are also able to exceed 1 terabit/second due to their location
   above nearly all water vapor. Compared to free-space optical links,
   evidence suggests THz systems are superior where fog, cloud cover and
   clear-air turbulence are of concern.}},

   traditional methods of treating neurogenic lower urinary tract
   dysfunction (NLUTD) resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI). In this
   review, we systematically discuss the neurophysiology of bladder
   dysfunction following SCI and the applications of electrical stimulation
   for bladder control following SCI, spanning from historic clinical
   approaches to recent pre-clinical studies that offer promising new
   strategies that may improve the feasibility and success of electrical
   stimulation therapy in patients with SCI. Electrical stimulation
   provides a unique opportunity to control bladder function by exploiting
   neural control mechanisms. Our understanding of the applications and
   limitations of electrical stimulation for bladder control has improved
   due to many pre-clinical studies performed in animals and translational
   clinical studies. Techniques that have emerged as possible opportunities
   to control bladder function include pudendal nerve stimulation and novel
   methods of stimulation, such as high frequency nerve block. Further
   development of novel applications of electrical stimulation will drive
   progress towards effective therapy for SCI. The optimal solution for
   restoration of bladder control may encompass a combination of efficient,
   targeted electrical stimulation, possibly at multiple locations, and
   pharmacological treatment to enhance symptom control.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the problem of moving target detection (MTD) for
   polarimetric multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar in the presence
   of Gaussian clutter. The authors extend the framework for MTD with MIMO
   radar to a generic number polarisation channels case. Within the
   polarimetric framework, the new generalised likelihood ratio test for
   moving target is first proposed. Then, the target velocity estimation
   problem is investigated. The maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator for
   target velocity is developed, and the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound is
   derived which serves as a benchmark of the estimation performance. Next,
   the adaptive version of the new polarimetric detector is considered. The
   covariance matrix is estimated using the sample covariance matrix and
   the model-based strategies based on the secondary data. Finally, several
   numerical simulations of the proposed polarimetric detector and ML
   estimator with typical parameters are obtained and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeThe purpose of this study was to determine whether susceptibility
   tensor imaging (STI) could overcome limitations of current techniques to
   detect tubules throughout the kidney.
   MethodsNormal mouse kidneys (n=4) were imaged at 9.4T using a
   three-dimensional gradient multi-echo sequence (55-micron isotropic
   resolution). Phase images from 12 orientations were obtained to compute
   the susceptibility tensor. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with 12
   encoding directions was compared with STI. Tractography was performed to
   visualize and track the course of tubules with DTI and STI. Confocal
   microscopy was used to identify which tubular segments of the nephron
   were detected by DTI and STI.
   ResultsDiffusion anisotropy was limited to the inner medulla of the
   kidney. DTI did not find a significant number of coherent tubular tracks
   in the outer medulla or cortex. With STI, we found strong susceptibility
   anisotropy and many tracks in the inner and outer medulla and in limited
   areas of the cortex.
   ConclusionSTI was able to track tubules throughout the kidney, whereas
   DTI was limited to the inner medulla. STI provides a novel contrast
   mechanism related to local tubule microstructure and may offer a
   powerful method to study the nephron. Magn Reson Med 73:1270-1281, 2015.

Abstract = {{Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by genetic mutations that
   result in the absence of dystrophin protein expression.
   Oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping can restore the dystrophin reading
   frame and protein production. However, this requires continuous drug
   administration and may not generate complete skipping of the targeted
   exon. In this study, we apply genome editing with zinc finger nucleases
   (ZFNs) to permanently remove essential splicing sequences in exon 51 of
   the dystrophin gene and thereby exclude exon 51 from the resulting
   dystrophin transcript. This approach can restore the dystrophin reading
   frame in similar to 13\% of DMD patient mutations. Transfection of two
   ZFNs targeted to sites flanking the exon 51 splice acceptor into DMD
   patient myoblasts led to deletion of this genomic sequence. A clonal
   population was isolated with this deletion and following differentiation
   we confirmed loss of exon 51 from the dystrophin mRNA transcript and
   restoration of dystrophin protein expression. Furthermore,
   transplantation of corrected cells into immunodeficient mice resulted in
   human dystrophin expression localized to the sarcolemmal membrane.
   Finally, we quantified ZFN toxicity in human cells and mutagenesis at
   predicted off-target sites. This study demonstrates a powerful method to
   restore the dystrophin reading frame and protein expression by
   permanently deleting exons.}},

   constitutive relation functional}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This work is concerned with large-scale three-dimensional (3D) inversion
   under transient elastodynamic conditions by means of the modified error
   in constitutive relation (MECR), an energy-based, cost functional. In
   contrast to quasi-static or frequency-domain contexts, time-domain
   formulations have so far seen very limited investigation. A peculiarity
   of time-domain MECR formulations is that each evaluation involves the
   solution of two elastodynamic problems (one forward, one backward),
   which moreover are coupled (unlike the case of L-2 misfit functionals,
   where the forward state does not depend on the adjoint state). This
   coupling creates a major computational bottleneck, making MECR-based
   inversion difficult for spatially 2D or 3D configurations. To overcome
   this obstacle, we propose an approach whose main ingredients are (a)
   setting the entire computational procedure in a consistent time-discrete
   framework that incorporates the chosen time-stepping algorithm, and (b)
   using an iterative successive over-relaxation-like method for the
   resulting stationarity equations. The resulting MECR-based inversion
   algorithm is formulated under quite general conditions, allowing for 3D
   transient elastodynamics, straightforward use of available parallel
   solvers, a wide array of time-stepping algorithms commonly used for
   transient structural dynamics, and flexible boundary condition and
   measurement settings. The proposed MECR algorithm is then demonstrated
   on computational experiments involving 2D and 3D transient
   elastodynamics and up to over 500 000 unknown elastic moduli.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria have developed resistance against every antibiotic at a rate
   that is alarming considering the timescale at which new antibiotics are
   developed. Thus, there is a critical need to use antibiotics more
   effectively, extend the shelf life of existing antibiotics and minimize
   their side effects. This requires understanding the mechanisms
   underlying bacterial drug responses. Past studies have focused on
   survival in the presence of antibiotics by individual cells, as genetic
   mutants or persisters. Also important, however, is the fact that a
   population of bacterial cells can collectively survive antibiotic
   treatments lethal to individual cells. This tolerance can arise by
   diverse mechanisms, including resistance-conferring enzyme production,
   titration-mediated bistable growth inhibition, swarming and
   interpopulation interactions. These strategies can enable rapid
   population recovery after antibiotic treatment and provide a time window

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the association between cystoid macular edema (CME)
   observed in very preterm infants and developmental outcomes at 18 to 24
   months corrected age.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Participants: Infants born at or less than 1500 g or at or less than 30
   weeks postmenstrual age who underwent screening for retinopathy of
   prematurity (ROP) in an intensive care nursery.
   Methods: Bedside handheld spectral-domain optical coherence tomography
   (SD OCT; Envisu, Bioptigen, Inc, Research Triangle Park, NC) imaging was
   obtained from preterm infants who were being screened for ROP and graded
   for presence of CME, central foveal thickness (CFT), inner nuclear layer
   thickness, and foveal-to-parafoveal thickness ratio. At 18 to 24 months
   corrected age, the children were assessed with the Bayley Scales of
   Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition.
   Main Outcome Measures: Scores on the Bayley cognitive, language, and
   motor subscales.
   Results: Among 77 children with SD OCT imaging, 53 were evaluated with
   the Bayley Scales. Compared with children who did not have CME as
   infants (n = 22), the mean score for children who had CME (n = 31) was
   7.3 points (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], -15.5 to 0.9; P = 0.08)
   lower on the cognitive subscale, 14.1 points (95\% CI, -22.7 to -5.5; P
   = 0.002) lower for the language subscale, and 11.5 points (95\% CI,
   -21.6 to -1.3; P = 0.03) lower for the motor subscale. Differences were
   maintained after adjusting for gestational age and birth weight.
   Severity of CME, as assessed by foveal-to-parafoveal thickness ratio,
   within the CME group correlated with poorer cognitive (R-2 = 0.16, P =
   0.03) and motor (R-2 = 0.15, P = 0.03) development.
   Conclusions: Cystoid macular edema observed on SD OCT in very preterm
   infants screened for ROP is associated with poorer language and motor
   skills at 18 to 24 months corrected age. Evaluation of the retina with
   SD-OCT may serve as an indicator of neurodevelopmental health for very
   preterm infants in the intensive care nursery. (C) 2015 by the American

Abstract = {{Realistic computer simulation of closed head trauma requires accurate
   mechanical properties of brain tissue, ideally in vivo. A substantive
   deficiency of most existing experimental brain data is that properties
   were identified through in vitro mechanical testing. This study develops
   a novel application of shear wave elasticity imaging to assess porcine
   brain tissue shear modulus in vivo. Shear wave elasticity imaging is a
   quantitative ultrasound technique that has been used here to examine
   changes in brain tissue shear modulus as a function of several
   experimental and physiologic parameters. Animal studies were performed
   using two different ultrasound transducers to explore the differences in
   physical response between closed skull and open skull arrangements. In
   vivo intracranial pressure in four animals was varied over a relevant
   physiologic range (2-40 mmHg) and was correlated with shear wave speed
   and stiffness estimates in brain tissue. We found that stiffness does
   not vary with modulation of intracranial pressure. Additional in vitro
   porcine specimens (n = 14) were used to investigate variation in brain
   tissue stiffness with temperature, confinement, spatial location and
   transducer orientation. We observed a statistically significant decrease
   in stiffness with increased temperature (23\%) and an increase in
   stiffness with decreasing external confinement (22-37\%). This study
   determined the feasibility of using shear wave elasticity imaging to
   characterize porcine brain tissue both in vitro and in vivo. Our results
   underline the importance of temperature-and skull-derived boundary
   conditions to brain stiffness and suggest that physiologic ranges of
   intracranial pressure do not significantly affect in situ brain tissue
   properties. Shear wave elasticity imaging allowed for brain material
   properties to be experimentally characterized in a physiologic setting
   and provides a stronger basis for assessing brain injury in
   computational models. (C) 2015 World Federation for Ultrasound in

Abstract = {{The development of advanced scaffolds that recapitulate the anisotropic
   mechanical behavior and biological functions of the extracellular matrix
   in leaflets would be transformative for heart valve tissue engineering.
   In this study, anisotropic mechanical properties were established in
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels by crosslinking stripes of 3.4 kDa
   PEG diacrylate (PEGDA) within 20 kDa PEGDA base hydrogels using a
   photolithographic patterning method. Varying the stripe width and
   spacing resulted in a tensile elastic modulus parallel to the stripes
   that was 4.1-6.8 times greater than that in the perpendicular direction,
   comparable to the degree of anisotropy between the circumferential and
   radial orientations in native valve leaflets. Biomimetic PEG-peptide
   hydrogels were prepared by tethering the cell-adhesive peptide RGDS and
   incorporating the collagenase-degradable peptide PQ (GGGPQG down arrow
   IWGQGK) into the polymer network. The specific amounts of RGDS and
   PEG-PQ within the resulting hydrogels influenced the elongation, de novo
   extracellular matrix deposition and hydrogel degradation behavior of
   encapsulated valvular interstitial cells (VICs). In addition, the
   morphology and activation of VICs grown atop PEG hydrogels could be
   modulated by controlling the concentration or micro-patterning profile
   of PEG-RGDS. These results are promising for the fabrication of
   PEG-based hydrogels using anatomically and biologically inspired
   scaffold design features for heart valve tissue engineering. (C) 2014

Title = {{Mitigation of hypertrophic scar contraction via an elastomeric
   biodegradable scaffold}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{61-70}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Hypertrophic scar (HSc) occurs in 40-70\% of patients treated for third
   degree burn injuries. Current burn therapies rely upon the use of
   bioengineered skin equivalents (BSEs), which assist in wound healing but
   do not prevent HSc contraction. HSc contraction leads to formation of a
   fixed, inelastic skin deformity. We propose that BSEs should maintain
   their architecture in the wound bed throughout the remodeling phase of
   repair to prevent HSc contraction. In this work we study a degradable,
   elastomeric, randomly oriented, electrospun micro-fibrous scaffold
   fabricated from the copolymer poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)
   (PLCL). PLCL scaffolds displayed appropriate elastomeric and tensile
   characteristics for implantation beneath a human skin graft. In vitro
   analysis using human dermal fibroblasts demonstrated that PLCL scaffolds
   decreased myofibroblast formation as compared to an in vitro HSc
   contraction model. Using a validated immune-competent murine MSc
   contraction model, we found that HSc contraction was significantly
   greater in animals treated with standard of care, Integra, as compared
   to those treated with collagen coated-PLCL (ccPLCL) scaffolds. Finally,
   wounds treated with ccPLCL were significantly less stiff than control
   wounds at d30 in vivo. Together, these data suggest that scaffolds which
   persist throughout the remodeling phase of repair may represent a
   clinically translatable method to prevent HSc contraction. (C) 2014

Volume = {{285}},
Pages = {{488-514}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a novel methodology for solving inverse problems
   under uncertainty using stochastic reduced order models (SROMs). Given
   statistical information about an observed state variable in a system,
   unknown parameters are estimated probabilistically through the solution
   of a model-constrained, stochastic optimization problem. The point of
   departure and crux of the proposed framework is the representation of a
   random quantity using a SROM-a low dimensional, discrete approximation
   to a continuous random element that permits efficient and non-intrusive
   stochastic computations. Characterizing the uncertainties with SROMs
   transforms the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one.
   The non-intrusive nature of SROMs facilitates efficient gradient
   computations for random vector unknowns and relies entirely on calls to
   existing deterministic solvers. Furthermore, the method is naturally
   extended to handle multiple sources of uncertainty in cases where state
   variable data, system parameters, and boundary conditions are all
   considered random.
   The new and widely-applicable SROM framework is formulated for a general
   stochastic optimization problem in terms of an abstract objective
   function and constraining model. For demonstration purposes, however, we
   study its performance in the specific case of inverse identification of
   random material parameters in elastodynamics. We demonstrate the ability
   to efficiently recover random shear moduli given material displacement
   statistics as input data. We also show that the approach remains
   effective for the case where the loading in the problem is random as
   well. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The unique optical properties of plasmon resonant nanostructures enable
   exploration of nanoscale environments using relatively simple optical
   characterization techniques. For this reason, the field of plasmonics
   continues to garner the attention of the biosensing community.
   Biosensors based on propagating surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) in
   films are the most well-recognized plasmonic biosensors, but there is
   great potential for the new, developing technologies to surpass the
   robustness and popularity of film-based SPR sensing. This review surveys
   the current plasmonic biosensor landscape with emphasis on the basic
   operating principles of each plasmonic sensing technique and the
   practical considerations when developing a sensing platform with the
   various techniques. The gold standard' film SPR technique is reviewed
   briefly, but special emphasis is devoted to the up-and-coming localized
   surface plasmon resonance and plasmonically coupled sensor technology.

Abstract = {{A polynomial chaos (PC) analysis with stochastic expansion coefficients
   is proposed for stochastic differential equations driven by additive or
   multiplicative Wiener noise. It is shown that for this setting, a
   Galerkin formalism naturally leads to the definition of a hierarchy of
   stochastic differential equations governing the evolution of the PC
   modes. Under the mild assumption that the Wiener and uncertain
   parameters can be treated as independent random variables, it is also
   shown that the Galerkin formalism naturally separates parametric
   uncertainty and stochastic forcing dependences. This enables us to
   perform an orthogonal decomposition of the process variance, and
   consequently identify contributions arising from the uncertainty in
   parameters, the stochastic forcing, and a coupled term. Insight gained
   from this decomposition is illustrated in light of implementation to
   simplified linear and non-linear problems; the case of a stochastic
   bifurcation is also considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a near-field 3-D synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   imaging system for which the 2-D aperture is radially scanned. Compared
   to the current SAR imaging systems, the proposed system has several
   advantages such as quick data collection, full 360. inspection of
   target, and simple image formation processing. However, in radial scan,
   the samples do not fall on a Cartesian grid, which prevents us from
   using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to form SAR image without calling
   for interpolation. In this paper, the 2-D nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) is used
   for dealing with the problem. After 2-D NUFFT of the radial sampled
   data, the 3-D reflectivity image can be efficiently reconstructed by
   using the 3-D version of the range migration algorithm. The Stolt
   mapping has been implemented implicitly by another 1-D NUFFT to reduce
   the artifacts caused by the conventional interpolation processing. In
   addition, to alleviate the data sampling burden, a compressed 2-D
   slow-time sampling strategy is also discussed. Finally, the proposed
   Rad-SAR system and the imaging method are demonstrated using near-field
   wideband simulation data.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene's relatively poor absorption is an essential obstacle for
   designing graphene-based photonic devices with satisfying
   photo-responsivity. To enhance the tunable light absorption of graphene,
   appropriate excitation of localized surface plasmon resonance is
   considered as a promising approach. In this work, the strategy of
   incorporating periodic cuboid gold nanoparticle (NP) cluster arrays and
   cylindrical gold NP arrays with Bragg reflectors into graphene-based
   photodetectors are theoretically studied by the boundary-integral
   spectral element method (BI-SEM). With the BI-SEM, the models can be
   numerically analyzed with excellent accuracy and efficiency. Numerical
   simulation shows that the proposed structures can effectively engineer
   the light absorption in graphene by tuning plasmon resonance. In the
   spectra of 300 nm to 1000 nm, a maximum light absorption of 67.54\% is
   observed for the graphene layer with optimal parameters of the
   photodetector model. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Eye models are valuable tools that can help delineate the role of
   anatomical parameters on visual performance and guide the design of
   advanced ophthalmic instrumentation. We propose an optically accurate
   wide-field schematic eye that reproduces the complete aberration profile
   of the human eye across a wide visual field. The optical performance of
   the schematic eye is based on experimentally measured wavefront
   aberrations taken with a four mm pupil for the central 80 degrees of the
   horizontal meridian (101 eyes) and 50 degrees of the vertical meridian
   (10 eyes). Across the entire field of view, our model shows excellent
   agreement with the measured data both comprehensively and for low-order
   and high-order aberrations. In comparison to previous eye models, our
   schematic eye excels at reproducing the aberrations of the retinal
   periphery. Also unlike previous models, tilt and decentering of the
   gradient refractive index crystalline lens, which arose naturally
   through the optimization process, permits our model to mimic the
   asymmetries of real human eyes while remaining both anatomically and
   optically correct. Finally, we outline a robust reverse building eye
   modeling technique that is capable of predicting trends beyond those
   defined explicitly in the optimization routine. Our proposed model may
   aid in the design of wide-field imaging instrumentation, including
   optical coherence tomography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy,
   fluorescence imaging, and fundus photography, and it has the potential
   to provide further insights in the study and understanding of the
   peripheral optics of the human eye. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A new Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain (DGTD) method for solving the
   3D time dependent Maxwell's equations via the electric field intensity E
   and magnetic flux density B fields is proposed for the first time. It
   uses curl-conforming and divergence-conforming basis functions for E and
   B, respectively, with the same order of interpolation. In this way,
   higher accuracy is achieved at lower memory consumption than the
   conventional approach based on the field variables E and H. The centered
   flux and Riemann solver are both used to treat interfaces with
   non-conforming meshes, and both explicit Runge-Kutta method and implicit
   Crank-Nicholson method are implemented for time integration. Numerical
   examples for realistic cases will be presented to verify that the
   proposed method is a non-spurious and efficient DGTD scheme. (C) 2014

   C-60 fullerene aggregates (ZVI/nC(60)) was produced via a rapid
   nucleation method. The device was conceived to deliver reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) generated by photosensitization and/or electron transfer
   to targeted contaminants, including waterborne pathogens under neutral
   pH conditions. Certain variations of the nano-composite were fabricated
   differing in the amounts of (1) ZVI (0.1 mM and 2 mM) but not nC(60)
   (2.5 mg-C/L), and (2) nC(60) (0-25 mg-C/L) but not ZVI (0.1 mM). The
   generation of ROS by the ZVI/nC(60) nano-composites and ZVI
   nanoparticles was quantified using organic probe compounds. 0.1 mM
   ZVI/2.5 mg-C/L C-60 generated 3.74-fold higher O-2(center dot-)
   concentration and also resulted in an additional 2-log inactivation of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa when compared to 0.1 mM ZVI (3-log inactivation).
   2 mM ZVI/2.5 mg-C/L nC(60) showed negligible improvement over 2 mM ZVI
   in terms of O-2(center dot-) generation or inactivation. Further,
   incremental amounts of nC(60) in the range of 0-25 mg-C/L in 0.1 mM
   ZVI/nC(60) led to increased O-2(center dot-) concentration, independent
   of UV-A. This study demonstrates that ZVI/nC(60) device delivers (1)
   enhanced O-2(center dot-) with nC(60) as a mediator for electron
   transfer, and (2) O-1(2) (only under UV-A illumination) at neutral pH
   conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of soil water partitioning in seasonally dry climates
   necessarily requires careful consideration of the periodic climatic
   forcing at the intra-annual timescale in addition to daily scale
   variabilities. Here, we introduce three new extensions to a stochastic
   soil moisture model which yields seasonal evolution of soil moisture and
   relevant hydrological fluxes. These approximations allow seasonal
   climatic forcings (e.g. rainfall and potential evapotranspiration) to be
   fully resolved, extending the analysis of soil water partitioning to
   account explicitly for the seasonal amplitude and the phase difference
   between the climatic forcings. The results provide accurate descriptions
   of probabilistic soil moisture dynamics under seasonal climates without
   requiring extensive numerical simulations. We also find that the
   transfer of soil moisture between the wet to the dry season is
   responsible for hysteresis in the hydrological response, showing
   asymmetrical trajectories in the mean soil moisture and in the transient
   Budyko's curves during the `dry-down' versus the `rewetting' phases of
   the year. Furthermore, in some dry climates where rainfall and potential
   evapotranspiration are in-phase, annual evapotranspiration can be shown
   to increase because of inter-seasonal soil moisture transfer,
   highlighting the importance of soil water storage in the seasonal
   context.}},

Abstract = {{Adoptive T cell immunotherapy offers a promising strategy for
   specifically targeting and eliminating malignant gliomas. T cells can be
   engineered ex vivo to express chimeric antigen receptors specific for

   tumoricidal effects of standard of care chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
   We describe a method for generating CAR T cells targeting EGFRvIII, a
   glioma-specific antigen, and evaluating their efficacy when combined
   with a murine model of glioblastoma standard of care. T cells are
   engineered by transduction with a retroviral vector containing the
   anti-EGFRvIII CAR gene. Tumor-bearing animals are subjected to host
   conditioning by a course of temozolomide and whole brain irradiation at
   dose regimens designed to model clinical standard of care. CAR T cells
   are then delivered intravenously to primed hosts. This method can be
   used to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells in the context of

Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{458-486}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that conventional edge elements in solving vector
   Maxwell's eigenvalue equations by the finite element method will lead to
   the presence of spurious zero eigenvalues. This problem has been
   addressed for the first order edge element by Kikuchi by the mixed
   element method. Inspired by this approach, this paper describes a higher
   order mixed spectral element method (mixed SEM) for the computation of
   two-dimensional vector eigenvalue problem of Maxwell's equations. It
   utilizes Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) polynomials as the basis functions
   in the finite-element framework with a weak divergence condition. It is
   shown that this method can suppress all spurious zero and nonzero modes
   and has spectral accuracy. A rigorous analysis of the convergence of the
   mixed SEM is presented, based on the higher order edge element
   interpolation error estimates, which fully confirms the robustness of
   our method. Numerical results are given for homogeneous, inhomogeneous,
   L-shape, coaxial and dual-inner-conductor cavities to verify the merits
   of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. We compared photoreceptor development from spectral domain
   optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging in very preterm infants
   (VPT, <32 weeks gestational age) with those of term infants.
   METHODS. The microanatomy of foveal SD-OCT images obtained at the
   bedside at 37 to 42 weeks term equivalent postmenstrual age (TEA) was
   reviewed with qualitative and quantitative analysis of retinal and
   especially photoreceptor layers in the macula. Measures of maturity
   included presence of the cone outer segment tips (COST) or the ellipsoid
   zone (EZ) at foveal center, distance from Bruch's membrane (BM) to the
   EZ at the foveal center, and radial distance from foveal center to first
   appearance of the EZ.
   RESULTS. The incidence of the EZ developed at the foveal center was
   lower in VPT infants (9/64, 14\%) versus term infants (22/47, 47\%, P <
   0.001) and lower in VPT infants with macular edema (3/46) versus VPT
   without edema (6/18, P = 0.01). Mean 6 SD distance from the foveal
   center to the visible EZ was 783 +/- 440 mu m in VPT, and 492 +/- 501 mu
   m in term infants, P = 0.002. The height of the BM-to-EZ at the foveal
   center did not differ in VPT versus term infants. The COST band was not
   visible in any infant.
   CONCLUSIONS. Photoreceptor inner and outer segment development in VPT
   infants appears delayed when compared to term infants, and the
   photoreceptor RPE junction remains immature in all infants at TEA.
   Delayed maturation of photoreceptors could contribute to differences in
   visual function in some VPT infants.}},

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial oligo (p-phenylene-ethynylene) (OPE) films have previously
   been demonstrated to show effective ultraviolet A (UVA) light-induced
   biocidal activity; however, a serious problem arises from the
   accumulation of dead bacteria and debris on the films that limits their
   effectiveness and application. In this work, we address this challenge
   by incorporating thermally-responsive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)
   (PNIPAAm), which provides on-demand bacteria-releasing functionality.
   Multifunctional surfaces comprising blended films of OPE and PNIPAAm
   were deposited on substrates by resonant infrared, matrix-assisted
   pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE) using a sequential co-deposition
   mode. In this way, RIR-MAPLE enabled the deposition of multifunctional
   films with surface properties and film functionality that can be
   tailored, precisely and systematically, by controlling the chemical
   composition of the deposited film. The surface properties of these films
   were characterized by UV-visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and
   water contact angle measurements. The interactions between bacteria and
   the deposited films were tested using two model bacteria: Escherichia
   coli K12 (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Gram-positive).
   The antimicrobial and bacteria-release properties of the blended films
   were controlled by varying the OPE/PNIPAAm ratio in the RIR-MAPLE
   emulsion target, providing an easy way to optimize the multifunctional
   surface. The OPE/PNIPAAm blended films with optimized composition killed
   a majority of attached E. coli bacteria at 37 degrees C and under UVA
   exposure, and the dead bacteria were then removed from the films simply
   by rinsing with water at 25 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{On-demand digital print service is an example of a real-time embedded
   enterprise system. It offers mass customization and exemplifies
   personalized manufacturing services. Once a print order is submitted to
   the print factory by a client, the print service provider (PSP) needs to
   make a real-time decision on whether to accept or refuse this order.
   Based on the print factory's current capacity and the order's properties
   and requirements, an order is refused if its acceptance is not
   profitable for the PSP. The order is accepted with the most appropriate
   due date in order to maximize the profit that can result from this
   order. We have developed an automated learning-based order admission
   framework that can be embedded into an enterprise environment to provide
   real-time admission decisions for new orders. The framework consists of
   three classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and
   Bayesian Probabilistic Model (BPM). The classifiers are trained by
   history orders and used to predict completion status for new orders. A
   decision integration technique is implemented to combine the results of
   the classifiers and predict due dates. Experimental results derived
   using real factory data from a leading print service provider and Weka
   open-source software show that the order completion status prediction
   accuracy is significantly improved by the decision integration strategy.
   The proposed multiclassifier model also outperforms a standalone
   regression model.}},

Abstract = {{The CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing platform is a promising technology to
   correct the genetic basis of hereditary diseases. The versatility,
   efficiency and multiplexing capabilities of the CRISPR/Cas9 system
   enable a variety of otherwise challenging gene correction strategies.
   Here, we use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to restore the expression of the
   dystrophin gene in cells carrying dystrophin mutations that cause
   Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We design single or multiplexed
   sgRNAs to restore the dystrophin reading frame by targeting the
   mutational hotspot at exons 45-55 and introducing shifts within exons or
   deleting one or more exons. Following gene editing in DMD patient
   myoblasts, dystrophin expression is restored in vitro. Human dystrophin
   is also detected in vivo after transplantation of genetically corrected
   patient cells into immunodeficient mice. Importantly, the unique
   multiplex geneediting capabilities of the CRISPR/Cas9 system facilitate
   the generation of a single large deletion that can correct up to 62\% of
   DMD mutations.}},

Title = {{Effects of High-Dose Microbeam Irradiation on Tumor Microvascular
   Function and Angiogenesis}},
Journal = {{RADIATION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{147-158}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) is a form of cancer treatment in which
   a single large dose of radiation is spatially fractionated in-line or
   grid-like patterns. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MRT is
   capable of eliciting high levels of tumor response while sparing normal
   tissue that is exposed to the same radiation field. Since a large
   fraction of the MRT-treated tumor is in the dose valley region that is
   not directly irradiated, tumor response may be driven by radiation
   bystander effects, which in turn elicit a microvascular response.
   Differential alterations in hemodynamics between the tumor and normal
   tissue may explain the therapeutic advantages of MRT. Direct observation
   of these dynamic responses presents a challenge for conventional ex vivo
   analysis. Furthermore, knowledge gleaned from in vitro studies of
   radiation bystander response has not been widely incorporated into in
   vivo models of tumor radiotherapy, and the biological contribution of
   the bystander effect within the tumor microenvironment is unknown. In
   this study, we employed noninvasive, serial observations of the tumor
   microenvironment to address the question of how tumor vasculature and
   HIF-1 expression are affected by microbeam radiotherapy. Tumors
   (approximately 4 mm in diameter) grown in a dorsal window chamber were
   irradiated in a single fraction using either a single, microplanar beam
   (300 micron wide swath) or a wide-field setup (whole-window chamber) to
   a total dose of 50 Gy. The tumors were optically observed daily for
   seven days postirradiation. Microvascular changes in the tumor and
   surrounding normal tissue differed greatly between the wide-field and
   microbeam treatments. We present evidence that these changes may be due
   to dissimilar spatial and temporal patterns of HIF-1 expression induced
   through radiation bystander effects. (C) 2015 by Radiation Research

Abstract = {{Understanding how protein oligomerization affects the stability of
   monomers in self-assembled structures is crucial to the development of
   new protein-based nanomaterials and protein cages for drug delivery.
   Here, we use single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS), protein
   engineering, and computer simulations to evaluate how dimerization and
   tetramerization affects the stability of the monomer of Streptavidin, a
   model homotetrameric protein. The unfolding force directly relates to
   the folding stability, and we find that monomer of Streptavidin is
   mechanically stabilized by 40\% upon dimerization, and that it is
   stabilized an additional 24\% upon tetramerization. We also find that
   biotin binding increases stability by another 50\% as compared to the
   apo-tetrameric form. We used the distribution of unfolding forces to
   extract properties of the underlying energy landscape and found that the
   distance to the transition state is decreased and the barrier height is
   increased upon multimerization. Finally, we investigated the origin of
   the strengthening by ligand binding. We found that, rather than being
   strengthened through intramolecular contacts, it is strengthened due to
   the contacts provided by the biotin-binding loop that crosses the
   interface between the dimers.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium has recently been demonstrated as a phase-change plasmonic
   material offering UV tunability, facile synthesis, and a remarkable
   stability due to its thin, self-terminating native oxide. However, the
   dense irregular nanoparticle (NP) ensembles fabricated by molecular-beam
   epitaxy make optical measurements of individual particles challenging.
   Here we employ hyperspectral cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy to
   characterize the response of single Ga NPs of various sizes within an
   irregular ensemble by spatially and spectrally resolving both in-plane
   and out-of-plane plasmonic modes. These modes, which include hybridized
   dipolar and higher-order terms due to phase retardation and substrate
   interactions, are correlated with finite difference time domain (FDTD)
   electrodynamics calculations that consider the Ga NP contact angle,
   substrate, and native Ga/Si surface oxidation. This study experimentally
   confirms previous theoretical predictions of plasmonic size-tunability
   in single Ga NPs and demonstrates that the plasmonic modes of
   interacting Ga nanoparticles can hybridize to produce strong hot spots
   in the ultraviolet. The controlled, robust UV plasmonic resonances of
   gallium nanoparticles are applicable to energy- and phase-specific
   applications such as optical memory, environmental remediation, and
   simultaneous fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopies.}},

Title = {{Development of a mobile tracer correlation method for assessment of air
   emissions from landfills and other area sources}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{A standardized version of a mobile tracer correlation measurement method
   was developed and used for assessment of methane emissions from 15
   landfills in 56 field deployments from 2009 to 2013. Using cavity
   ring-down spectroscopy and acetylene tracer gas, this method has
   potential implementation and cost advantages over other mobile tracer
   correlation approaches. The field deployment, data acquisition and
   analysis procedures, and a range of use conditions are discussed. To
   test real-world method application, the field studies were conducted by
   engineering technician-level personnel under randomly-encountered
   daytime atmospheric conditions. A total of 1876 mobile tracer
   correlation measurement transects were attempted over 131 field sampling
   days. Of these, 1366 transect (73\%) were successfully completed and
   passed basic data acceptance criteria as valid measurement attempts.
   Invalid data were caused primarily by equipment failures, transect
   execution errors, or poor plume transport conditions. Valid transects
   were further analyzed using signal-to-noise ratio, plume correlation,
   and emission rate difference method quality indicators described here.
   Encountered scenarios that can result in high emission measurement
   uncertainty or bias are discussed in term of these indicators.
   Reasonable values for the acceptance levels of the method quality
   indicators that help protect against method errors and reduce
   measurement noise are discussed. The application of a default indicator
   set to the valid data yield 456 transects (33\%) that pass data
   acceptance criteria. Transects that fail were associated with
   insufficient advected plume transport, poor correlation between the
   tracer and source plumes, and potential emissions pooling conditions.

Abstract = {{The seemingly disjoint problems of count and mixture modeling are united
   under the negative binomial (NB) process. A gamma process is employed to
   model the rate measure of a Poisson process, whose normalization
   provides a random probability measure for mixture modeling and whose
   marginalization leads to an NB process for count modeling. A draw from
   the NB process consists of a Poisson distributed finite number of
   distinct atoms, each of which is associated with a logarithmic
   distributed number of data samples. We reveal relationships between
   various count-and mixture-modeling distributions and construct a
   Poisson-logarithmic bivariate distribution that connects the NB and
   Chinese restaurant table distributions. Fundamental properties of the
   models are developed, and we derive efficient Bayesian inference. It is
   shown that with augmentation and normalization, the NB process and
   gamma-NB process can be reduced to the Dirichlet process and
   hierarchical Dirichlet process, respectively. These relationships
   highlight theoretical, structural, and computational advantages of the
   NB process. A variety of NB processes, including the beta-geometric,
   beta-NB, marked-beta-NB, marked-gamma-NB and zero-inflated-NB processes,
   with distinct sharing mechanisms, are also constructed. These models are
   applied to topic modeling, with connections made to existing algorithms
   under Poisson factor analysis. Example results show the importance of
   inferring both the NB dispersion and probability parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Super-resolution methods form high-resolution images from low-resolution
   images. In this paper, we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric model for
   super-resolution. Our method uses a beta-Bernoulli process to learn a
   set of recurring visual patterns, called dictionary elements, from the
   data. Because it is nonparametric, the number of elements found is also
   determined from the data. We test the results on both benchmark and
   natural images, comparing with several other models from the research
   literature. We perform large-scale human evaluation experiments to
   assess the visual quality of the results. In a first implementation, we
   use Gibbs sampling to approximate the posterior. However, this algorithm
   is not feasible for large-scale data. To circumvent this, we then
   develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm. This algorithm finds
   high quality dictionaries in a fraction of the time needed by the Gibbs
   sampler.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging has shown promise for
   visualizing structure and pathology within multiple organs; however,
   because the contrast depends on the push beam excitation width, image
   quality suffers outside of the region of excitation. Multi-focal-zone
   ARFI imaging has previously been used to extend the region of excitation
   (ROE), but the increased acquisition duration and acoustic exposure have
   limited its utility. Supersonic shear wave imaging has previously
   demonstrated that through technological improvements in ultrasound
   scanners and power supplies, it is possible to rapidly push at multiple
   locations before tracking displacements, facilitating extended depth of
   field shear wave sources. Similarly, ARFI imaging can utilize these same
   radiation force excitations to achieve tight pushing beams with a large
   depth of field. Finite element method simulations and experimental data
   are presented, demonstrating that single-and rapid multi-focal-zone ARFI
   have comparable image quality (less than 20\% loss in contrast), but the
   multi-focal-zone approach has an extended axial region of excitation.
   Additionally, as compared with single-push sequences, the rapid
   multi-focal-zone acquisitions improve the contrast-to-noise ratio by up
   to 40\% in an example 4-mm-diameter lesion.}},

Abstract = {{Diastolic heart failure (DHF) is a major source of cardiac related
   morbidity and mortality in the world today. A major contributor to, or
   indicator of DHF is a change in cardiac compliance. Currently, there is
   no accepted clinical method to evaluate the compliance of cardiac tissue
   in diastolic dysfunction. Shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) is a
   novel ultrasound-based elastography technique that provides a measure of
   tissue stiffness. Coronary perfusion pressure affects cardiac stiffness
   during diastole; we sought to characterize the relationship between
   these two parameters using the SWEI technique. In this work, we
   demonstrate how changes in coronary perfusion pressure are reflected in
   a local SWEI measurement of stiffness during diastole. Eight Langendorff
   perfused isolated rabbit hearts were used in this study. Coronary
   perfusion pressure was changed in a randomized order (0-90 mmHg range)
   and SWEI measurements were recorded during diastole with each change.
   Coronary perfusion pressure and the SWEI measurement of stiffness had a
   positive linear correlation with the 95\% confidence interval (CI) for
   the slope of 0.009-0.011 m/s/mmHg (R-2 = 0.88). Furthermore, shear
   modulus was linearly correlated to the coronary perfusion pressure with
   the 95\% CI of this slope of 0.035-0.042 kPa/mmHg (R-2 = 0.83). In
   conclusion, diastolic SWEI measurements of stiffness can be used to
   characterize factors affecting cardiac compliance specifically the
   mechanical interaction (cross-talk) between perfusion pressure in the
   coronary vasculature and cardiac muscle. This relationship was found to
   be linear over the range of pressures tested.}},

Abstract = {{Prebond testing of through-silicon-vias (TSVs) and die logic is a
   significant challenge and a potential roadblock for 3-D integration.
   Built-in self-test solutions introduce considerable die area overhead.
   Oversized probe pads on TSVs to provide prebond test access limit both
   test bandwidth and TSV density. This paper presents a solution to these
   problems, allowing a probe card to contact TSVs without the need for
   probe pads, enabling both TSV and prebond scan test. Several possible
   prebond scan test configurations are shown-they provide varying degrees
   of test parallelism under design constraints. HSPICE simulations are
   performed on two logic-on-logic 3-D benchmarks. Results show that the
   ratio of the number of probe needles available for test access to the
   number of prebond scan chains determines which prebond scan
   configuration results in the shortest test time. Maximum prebond scan-in
   and scan-out shift-clock speeds are determined for dies in a benchmark
   3-D design as a function of driver strength and transmission gate width.
   These clock speeds show that prebond scan test can be performed at a
   speed that is comparable with scan testing of packaged dies. The maximum
   clock speed can also be tuned by changing the drive strength of the
   probe and on-die drivers of the TSV network. Estimates are also provided
   for peak and average power consumption during prebond scan test for both
   a high-power pattern per scan chain and an average power pattern per
   scan chain. On-die area overhead for the proposed method is estimated to
   be between 1.0\% and 2.9\% per die for two 3-D benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Irrigation represents one of the main strategies to enhance and
   stabilize agricultural productivity, by mitigating the effects of
   rainfall vagaries. In the face of the projected growth in population and
   in biofuel demands, as well as shifts in climate and dietary habits, a
   more sustainable management of water resources in agroecosystems is
   needed. The field of ecohydrology, traditionally focusing on natural
   ecosystems, has the potential to offer the necessary quantitative tools
   to assess and compare agricultural enterprises across climates, soil
   types, crops, and irrigation strategies, accounting for the
   unpredictability of the hydro-climatic forcing. Here, agricultural
   sustainability and productivity are assessed with reference to water
   productivity (defined as the ratio between yield and total supplied
   water), yields, water requirements, and their variability-a crucial
   element for food security and resource allocation planning. These
   synthetic indicators are quantified by means of a probabilistic
   description of the soil water balance and crop development. The model
   results allow the interpretation of patterns of water productivity
   observed in Zea mays (maize) and Triticum aestivum (wheat), grown under
   a variety of soils, climates, and irrigation strategies. Employing the
   same modeling framework, the impact of rainfall pattern and irrigation
   strategy on yield and water requirements is further explored. The
   obtained standard deviations of yield and water requirements suggest the
   existence of a nonlinear tradeoff between yield stabilization and
   variability of water requirements, which in turn is strongly impacted by
   irrigation strategy. Moreover, intermediate rainfall amounts are
   associated to the highest variability in yields and irrigation
   requirements, although allowing the maximum water productivity. The
   existence of these tradeoffs between productivity, reliability, and
   sustainability poses a problem for water management, in particular in
   mesic climates.}},

   their strong association with aquatic organic matter, detailed knowledge
   of the ultimate fate and persistence of SWNT requires investigation of
   possible biotransformations (i.e., biodegradation) in environmental

   biodegradation over 6 mo by pure liquid culture of the fungus Trametes
   versicolor and mixed bacterial isolates from field-collected sediment or
   aerated wastewater treatment plant sludge. The mixed cultures were
   chosen as more environmentally relevant media where SWNT will likely be
   deposited under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Activity of
   {[}C-14] was assessed in solid, aqueous, and (CO2)-C-14 gaseous phases
   to determine amounts of intact SWNT, partially soluble SWNT degradation
   products, and mineralized SWNT, respectively, during the 6 mo of the
   experiment. Mass balances based on radiocarbon activity were
   approximately 100\% over 6 mo, and no significant degradation of SWNT
   was observed. Approximately 99\% of the {[}C-14] activity remained in
   the solid phase, 0.8\% in the aqueous phase, and less than 0.1\% was
   mineralized to (CO2)-C-14, regardless of culture type. These results
   suggest that SWNT are not readily biodegraded by pure fungal cultures or
   environmental microbial communities, and are likely persistent in

Abstract = {{The adoption of antisense gene silencing as a novel disinfectant for
   prokaryotic organisms is hindered by poor silencing efficiencies. Few
   studies have considered the effects of off-targets on silencing
   efficiencies, especially in prokaryotic organisms. In this computational
   study, a novel algorithm was developed that determined and sorted the
   number of off-targets as a function of alignment length in Escherichia
   coli K-12 MG1655 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The mean number
   of off-targets per a single location was calculated to be 14.1 +/- 13.3
   and 36.1 +/- 58.5 for the genomes of E. coli K-12 MG1655 and M.
   tuberculosis H37Rv, respectively. Furthermore, when the entire
   transcriptome was analyzed, it was found that there was no general gene
   location that could be targeted to minimize or maximize the number of
   off-targets. In an effort to determine the effects of off-targets on
   silencing efficiencies, previously published studies were used. Analyses
   with acpP, ino1, and marORAB revealed a statistically significant
   relationship between the number of short alignment length off-targets
   hybrids and the efficacy of the antisense gene silencing, suggesting
   that the minimization of off-targets may be beneficial for antisense
   gene silencing in prokaryotic organisms. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A T-shaped stub-loaded ring-resonator (SLRR) slot etched on the ground

   antenna applications. Compared with the conventional ring slot, the two
   resonant frequencies of the proposed SLRR-slot can be lowered, and can
   also be tunable by varying the parameters of the four T-shaped stubs. To
   validate the design concept, a tri-band printed antenna and a dual
   band-notched ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna using the SLRR-slot on the
   ground plane and radiating patch, respectively, are presented. For the
   tri-band antenna, a simple U-shaped slot etched on the microstrip
   feeding line is used to excite a third upper-frequency band
   independently without increasing the overall size of the antenna and
   without affecting the lower two bands. The proposed tri-band antenna has
   three frequency bands of 2.4, 3.5, and 5.8 GHz, and the dual
   band-notched UWB antenna can guarantee a very wide bandwidth from 3.0 to

Abstract = {{Fourier transform of discontinuous functions are often encountered in
   computational electromagnetics and other areas. In this work, a highly
   accurate, fast conformal Fourier transform (CFT) algorithm is proposed
   to evaluate the finite Fourier transform of 3D discontinuous functions.
   A curved tetrahedron mesh combined with curvilinear coordinate
   transform, instead of the Cartesian grid, is adopted to flexibly model
   an arbitrary shape of the discontinuity boundary. This enables us to
   take full advantages of high order interpolation and Gaussian quadrature
   methods to achieve highly accurate Fourier integration results with a
   low sampling density. The 3D nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)
   helps to keep the complexity of the proposed algorithm to that similar
   to the traditional 3D FFT algorithm. Therefore, the proposed CFT
   algorithm can achieve order of magnitude higher accuracy than 3D FFT
   with lower sampling density and similar computation time. The
   convergence is proved and verified.}},

Title = {{Increasing BCI communication rates with dynamic stopping towards more

Abstract = {{Objective. The P300 speller is a brain-computer interface (BCI) that can
   possibly restore communication abilities to individuals with severe
   neuromuscular disabilities, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
   by exploiting elicited brain signals in electroencephalography (EEG)
   data. However, accurate spelling with BCIs is slow due to the need to
   average data over multiple trials to increase the signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) of the elicited brain signals. Probabilistic approaches to
   dynamically control data collection have shown improved performance in
   non-disabled populations; however, validation of these approaches in a
   target BCI user population has not occurred. Approach. We have developed
   a data-driven algorithm for the P300 speller based on Bayesian inference
   that improves spelling time by adaptively selecting the number of trials
   based on the acute SNR of a user's EEG data. We further enhanced the
   algorithm by incorporating information about the user's language. In
   this current study, we test and validate the algorithms online in a
   target BCI user population, by comparing the performance of the dynamic
   stopping (DS) (or early stopping) algorithms against the current
   state-of-the-art method, static data collection, where the amount of
   data collected is fixed prior to online operation. Main results. Results
   from online testing of the DS algorithms in participants with ALS
   demonstrate a significant increase in communication rate as measured in
   bits/min (100-300\%), and theoretical bit rate (100-550\%), while
   maintaining selection accuracy. Participants also overwhelmingly
   preferred the DS algorithms. Significance. We have developed a viable
   BCI algorithm that has been tested in a target BCI population which has
   the potential for translation to improve BCI speller performance towards
   more practical use for communication.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled enzyme dehydration using a new processing technique of
   Microglassification has been investigated. Aqueous solution
   microdroplets of lysozyme, -chymotrypsin, catalase, and horseradish
   peroxidase were dehydrated in n-pentanol, n-octanol, n-decanol,
   triacetin, or butyl lactate, and changes in their structure and function
   were analyzed upon rehydration. Water solubility and microdroplet
   dissolution rate in each solvent decreased in the order: butyl lactate >
   n-pentanol > triacetin > n-octanol > n-decanol. Enzymes Microglassified
   in n-pentanol retained higher activity (93\%-98\%) than n-octanol
   (78\%-85\%) or n-decanol (75\%-89\%), whereas those Microglassified in
   triacetin (36\%-75\%) and butyl lactate (48\%-79\%) retained markedly
   lower activity. FTIR spectroscopy analyses showed -helix to -sheet
   transformation for all enzymes upon Microglassification, reflecting a
   loss of bound water in the dried state; however, the enzymes reverted to
   native-like conformation upon rehydration. Accelerated stressed-storage
   tests using Microglassified lysozyme showed a significant (p < 0.01)
   decrease in enzymatic activity from 46,560 +/- 2736 to 31,060 +/- 4327
   units/mg after 3 months of incubation; however, it was comparable to the
   activity of the lyophilized formulation throughout the test period.
   These results establish Microglassification as a viable technique for
   enzyme preservation without affecting its structure or function. (c)

Title = {{Two-Dimensional Aperture Coding for Magnetic Sector Mass Spectrometry}},

Abstract = {{In mass spectrometer design, there has been a historic belief that there
   exists a fundamental trade-off between instrument size, throughput, and
   resolution. When miniaturizing a traditional system, performance loss in
   either resolution or throughput would be expected. However, in optical
   spectroscopy, both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D)
   aperture coding have been used for many years to break a similar
   trade-off. To provide a viable path to miniaturization for harsh
   environment field applications, we are investigating similar concepts in
   sector mass spectrometry. Recently, we demonstrated the viability of 1D
   aperture coding and here we provide a first investigation of 2D coding.
   In coded optical spectroscopy, 2D coding is preferred because of
   increased measurement diversity for improved conditioning and robustness
   of the result. To investigate its viability in mass spectrometry,
   analytes of argon, acetone, and ethanol were detected using a custom
   90-degree magnetic sector mass spectrometer incorporating 2D coded
   apertures. We developed a mathematical forward model and reconstruction
   algorithm to successfully reconstruct the mass spectra from the 2D
   spatially coded ion positions. This 2D coding enabled a 3.5x throughput
   increase with minimal decrease in resolution. Several challenges were
   overcome in the mass spectrometer design to enable this coding,
   including the need for large uniform ion flux, a wide gap magnetic
   sector that maintains field uniformity, and a high resolution 2D
   detection system for ion imaging. Furthermore, micro-fabricated 2D coded
   apertures incorporating support structures were developed to provide a
   viable design that allowed ion transmission through the open elements of
   the code.}},

Title = {{Shock wave lithotripsy: The new phoenix?}},
Journal = {{WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},

Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Following its introduction in 1980, shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) rapidly
   emerged as the first-line treatment for the majority of patients with
   urolithiasis. Millions of SWL therapies have since been performed
   worldwide, and nowadays, SWL still remains to be the least invasive
   therapy modality for urinary stones. During the last three decades, SWL
   technology has advanced in terms of shock wave generation, focusing,
   patient coupling and stone localization. The implementation of
   multifunctional lithotripters has made SWL available to urology
   departments worldwide. Indications for SWL have evolved as well.
   Although endoscopic treatment techniques have improved significantly and
   seem to take the lead in stone therapy in the western countries due to
   high stone-free rates, SWL continues to be considered as the first-line
   therapy for the treatment of most intra-renal stones and many ureteral
   stones.
   This paper reviews the fundamentals of SWL physics to facilitate a
   better understanding about how a lithotripter works and should be best
   utilized.
   Advances in lithotripsy technology such as shock wave generation and
   focusing, advances in stone localization (imaging), different energy
   source concepts and coupling modalities are presented. Furthermore
   adjuncts to improve the efficacy of SWL including different treatment
   strategies are reviewed.
   If urologists make use of a more comprehensive understanding of the
   pathophysiology and physics of shock waves, much better results could be
   achieved in the future. This may lead to a renaissance and encourage SWL
   as first-line therapy for urolithiasis in times of rapid progress in
   endoscopic treatment modalities.}},

Abstract = {{The tissue adhesive 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (OCA) was encapsulated in
   polyurethane microshells and incorporated into bone cement to form a
   catalyst free, self-healing bone cement comprised of all clinically
   approved components. The bending strength, modulus, and fatigue lifetime
   were investigated in accordance with ASTM and ISO standards for the
   testing of PMMA bone cement. The bending strength of bone cement
   specimens decreased with increasing wt \% capsules content for capsules
   without or with OCA, with specimens of <5 wt \% capsule content showing
   minimal effect. In contrast, bone cement bending modulus was insensitive
   to capsule content. Load controlled fatigue testing was performed in air
   at room temperature on capsule free bone cement (0 wt \%), bone cement
   with 5 wt \% OCA-free capsules (5 wt \% No OCA), and 5 wt \%
   OCA-containing capsules (5 wt \% OCA). Specimens were tested at a
   frequency of 5 Hz at maximum stresses of 90\%, 80\%, 70\%, and 50\% of
   each specimen's bending strength until failure. The 5 wt \% OCA
   exhibited significant self-healing at 70\% and 50\% of its reference
   strength (p<0.05). Fatigue testing of all three specimen types in air at
   22 MPa (50\% of reference strength of the 5 wt \% OCA specimens) showed
   that the cycles to failure of OCA-containing specimens was increased by
   two-fold compared with the OCA-free and capsule-free specimens. This
   study represents the first demonstration of dynamic, catalyst free
   self-healing in a biomaterial formulation. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Stochastic resonance (SR) is the enhanced representation of a weak input
   signal by the addition of an optimal level of broadband noise to a
   nonlinear (threshold) system. Since its discovery in the 1980s the
   domain of input signals shown to be applicable to SR has greatly
   expanded, from strictly periodic inputs to now nearly any aperiodic
   forcing function. The perturbations (noise) used to generate SR have
   also expanded, from white noise to now colored noise or vibrational
   forcing. This study demonstrates that a new class of perturbations can
   achieve SR, namely, series of stochastically generated biphasic pulse
   trains. Using these pulse trains as `noise' we show that a Hodgkin
   Huxley model neuron exhibits SR behavior when detecting weak input
   signals. This result is of particular interest to neuroscience because
   nearly all artificial neural stimulation is implemented with square
   current or voltage pulses rather than broadband noise, and this new
   method may facilitate the translation of the performance gains
   achievable through SR to neural prosthetics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We investigate the mechanism through which N-cadherin
   disruption alters the effectiveness of regional chemotherapy for locally
   advanced melanoma.
   Background: N-cadherin antagonism during regional chemotherapy has
   demonstrated variable treatment effects.
   Methods: Isolated limb infusion (ILI) with melphalan (LPAM) or
   temozolomide (TMZ) was performed on rats bearing melanoma xenografts
   after systemic administration of the N-cadherin antagonist, ADH-1, or
   saline. Permeability studies were performed using Evans blue dye as the
   infusate, and interstitial fluid pressure was measured.
   Immunohistochemistry of LPAM-DNA adducts and damage was performed as
   surrogates for LPAM and TMZ delivery. Tumor signaling was studied by
   Western blotting and reverse-phase protein array analysis.
   Results: Systemic ADH-1 was associated with increased growth and
   activation of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase)-AKT pathway in
   A375 but not DM443 xenografts. ADH-1 in combination with LPAM ILI
   improved antitumor responses compared with LPAM alone in both cell
   lines. Combination of ADH-1 with TMZ ILI did not improve tumor response
   in A375 tumors. ADH-1 increased vascular permeability without effecting
   tumor interstitial fluid pressure, leading to increased delivery of LPAM
   but not TMZ.
   Conclusions: ADH-1 improved responses to regional LPAM but had variable
   effects on tumors regionally treated with TMZ. N-cadherin-targeting
   agents may lead to differential effects on the AKT signaling axis that
   can augment growth of some tumors. The vascular targeting actions of
   N-cadherin antagonism may not augment some regionally delivered
   alkylating agents, leading to a net increase in tumor size with this
   type of combination treatment strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical index (MI) attempts to quantify the likelihood that
   exposure to diagnostic ultrasound will produce an adverse biological
   effect by a non-thermal mechanism. The current formulation of the MI
   implicitly assumes that the acoustic field is generated using the short
   pulse durations appropriate to B-mode imaging. However, acoustic
   radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging employs high-intensity pulses up
   to several hundred acoustic periods long. The effect of increased pulse
   durations on the thresholds for inertial cavitation was studied
   computationally in water, urine, blood, cardiac and skeletal muscle,
   brain, kidney, liver and skin. The results indicate that, although the
   effect of pulse duration on cavitation thresholds in the three liquids
   can be considerable, reducing them by, for example, 6\%-24\% at 1 MHz,
   the effect on tissue is minor. More importantly, the frequency
   dependence of the MI appears to be unnecessarily conservative; that is,
   the magnitude of the exponent on frequency could be increased to 0.75.
   Comparison of these theoretical results with experimental measurements
   suggests that some tissues do not contain the pre-existing, optimally
   sized bubbles assumed for the MI. This means that in these tissues, the
   MI is not necessarily a strong predictor of the probability of an
   adverse biological effect. (C) 2015 World Federation for Ultrasound in

Abstract = {{Although biofilm-based biotechnologies exhibit a large potential as
   solutions for off-gas treatment, the high water content of biofilms
   often causes pollutant mass transfer limitations, which ultimately limit
   their widespread application. The present study reports on the proof of
   concept of the applicability of bioactive latex coatings for air
   pollution control. Toluene vapors served as a model volatile organic
   compound (VOC). The results showed that Pseudomonas putida F1 cells
   could be successfully entrapped in nanoporous latex coatings while
   preserving their toluene degradation activity. Bioactive latex coatings
   exhibited toluene specific biodegradation rates 10 times higher than
   agarose-based biofilms, because the thin coatings were less subject to
   diffusional mass transfer limitations. Drying and pollutant starvation
   were identified as key factors inducing a gradual deterioration of the
   biodegradation capacity in these innovative coatings. This study
   constitutes the first application of bioactive latex coatings for VOC
   abatement. These coatings could become promising means for air pollution
   control. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A low-rank transformation learning framework for subspace clustering and
   classification is proposed here. Many high-dimensional data, such as
   face images and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of
   low-dimensional subspaces. The corresponding subspace clustering problem
   has been extensively studied in the literature to partition such
   high-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their underlying
   low-dimensional subspaces. Low-dimensional intrinsic structures are
   often violated for real-world observations, as they can be corrupted by
   errors or deviate from ideal models. We propose to address this by
   learning a linear transformation on subspaces using nuclear norm as the
   modeling and optimization criteria. The learned linear transformation
   restores a low-rank structure for data from the same subspace, and, at
   the same time, forces a maximally separated structure for data from
   different subspaces. In this way, we reduce variations within the
   subspaces, and increase separation between the subspaces for a more
   robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace
   clustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing
   subspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results presented here
   help to further support the underlying framework. To exploit the
   low-rank structures of the transformed subspaces, we further introduce a
   fast subspace clustering technique, which efficiently combines robust
   PCA with sparse modeling. When class labels are present at the training
   stage, we show this low-rank transformation framework also significantly
   enhances classification performance. Extensive experiments using public
   data sets are presented, showing that the proposed approach
   significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for subspace
   clustering and classification. The learned low cost transform is also
   applicable to other classification frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{Digital image correlation (DIC) is nowadays widely applied to many

   technique. To minimize the potential effect of spatial sampling

   displacement computation over entire specimen surfaces. Depending on
   local deformation states, the algorithm can automatically optimize
   spatial distribution of sampling points over specimen surfaces in a
   self-adaptive manner in combination with the well-developed DIC
   algorithm with Gaussian windows. Both a series of well-designed
   computer-simulated speckle images and actual cell-substrate deformation
   ones are employed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm, which demonstrates that the set of self-adaptive
   sampling algorithm is capable of recovering more accurate and precise
   full-field displacements compared to the conventional DIC algorithm with

Abstract = {{Positioning 3-D targets buried in layered medium with electromagnetic
   waves has widespread applications, such as the detection of land mines.
   Most of the current electromagnetic inverse methods need to know the
   preknowledge of the dielectric properties for layered background medium,
   in order to accurately reconstruct concealed targets. However, this
   condition is hardly satisfied in real problems. In this letter, an
   electromagnetic inverse scattering series method (EISSM) is developed
   and derived for positioning 3-D targets buried in two-layered medium.
   The prominent advantage of the proposed method is that it does not need
   any prior information about the dielectric properties of the layered
   medium. The position error predicted by the EISSM is analyzed and
   discussed. Compared with the commonly used time-reversal-mirror
   technique, numerical simulations show that the EISSM is capable of
   positioning the target buried in two-layer medium with less error.}},

Abstract = {{We report the development of non-invasive, fiber-based diffuse optical
   spectroscopy for simultaneously quantifying vascular oxygenation (SO2)
   and glucose uptake in solid tumors in vivo. Glucose uptake was measured
   using a fluorescent glucose analog,
   2-{[}N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diaxol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose
   (2-NBDG). Quantification of label-free SO2 and 2-NBDG-fluorescence-based
   glucose uptake 60 minutes after administration of the tracer
   (2-NBDG(60)) was performed using computational models of light-tissue
   interaction. This study was carried out on normal tissue and 4T1 and
   4T07 murine mammary tumor xenografts in vivo. Injection of 2-NBDG did
   not cause a significant change in optical measurements of SO2,
   demonstrating its suitability as a functional reporter of tumor glucose
   uptake. Correction of measured 2-NBDG-fluorescence for the effects of
   absorption and scattering significantly improved contrast between tumor
   and normal tissue. The 4T1 and 4T07 tumors showed significantly
   decreased SO2, and 4T1 tumors demonstrated increased 2-NBDG(60) compared
   with normal tissue (60 minutes after the administration of 2-NBDG when
   perfusion-mediated effects have cleared). 2-NBDG-fluorescence was found
   to be highly sensitive to food deprivation-induced reduction in blood
   glucose levels, demonstrating that this endpoint is indeed sensitive to
   glycolytic demand. 2-NBDG(60) was also found to be linearly related to
   dose, underscoring the importance of calibrating for dose when comparing
   across animals or experiments. 4T1 tumors demonstrated an inverse
   relationship between 2-NBDG(60) and SO2 that was consistent with the
   Pasteur effect, particularly when exposed to hypoxic gas breathing. Our
   results illustrate the potential of optical spectroscopy to provide
   valuable information about the metabolic status of tumors, with
   important implications for cancer prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the control of the polymerization process for melon
   (graphitic carbon nitride), with the aim of improving its photocatalytic
   activity intrinsically. We demonstrate here that reduction of the
   synthesis temperature leads to a mixture of the monomer melem and its
   higher condensates. We show that this mixture can be separated and
   provide evidence that the higher condensates are isolated oligomers of
   melem. On evaluating their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen
   evolution, the oligomers were found to be the most active species,
   having up to twice the activity of the monomer/oligomer mixture of the
   as-synthesized material, which in turn has 3 times the activity of the
   polymer melon, the literature benchmark. These results highlight the
   role of defects, i.e., chain terminations, in increasing the catalytic
   activity of carbon nitrides and at the same time point to the ample
   potential of intrinsically improving the photocatalytic activity of
   carbon nitride, especially through the selective synthesis of the active
   phase.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancement and manipulation of light absorption in graphene is a
   significant issue for applications of graphene-based optoelectronic
   devices. In order to achieve this purpose in the visible region, we
   demonstrate a design of a graphene optical absorber inspired by
   metal-dielectric-metal metamaterial for perfect absorption of
   electromagnetic waves. The optical absorbance ratios of single and three
   atomic layer graphene are enhanced up to 37.5\% and 64.8\%,
   respectively. The graphene absorber shows polarization-dependence and
   tolerates a wide range of incident angles. Furthermore, the peak
   position and bandwidth of graphene absorption spectra are tunable in a
   wide wavelength range through a specific structural configuration. These
   results imply that graphene in combination with plasmonic perfect
   absorbers have a promising potential for developing advanced
   nanophotonic devices. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},
