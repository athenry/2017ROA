Title = {{Spatial forcing of pattern-forming systems that lack inversion symmetry}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{The entrainment of periodic patterns to spatially periodic parametric
   forcing is studied. Using a weak nonlinear analysis of a simple pattern
   formation modelwe study the resonant responses of one-dimensional
   systems that lack inversion symmetry. Focusing on the first three n : 1
   resonances, in which the system adjusts its wavenumber to one nth of the
   forcing wavenumber, we delineate commonalities and differences among the
   resonances. Surprisingly, we find that all resonances show multiplicity
   of stable phase states, including the 1 : 1 resonance. The phase states
   in the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonances, however, differ from those in the 1 :
   1 resonance in remaining symmetric even when the inversion symmetry is
   broken. This is because of the existence of a discrete translation
   symmetry in the forced system. As a consequence, the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1
   resonances show stationary phase fronts and patterns, whereas phase
   fronts within the 1 : 1 resonance are propagating and phase patterns are
   transients. In addition, we find substantial differences between the 2 :
   1 resonance and the other two resonances. While the pattern forming
   instability in the 2 : 1 resonance is supercritical, in the 1 : 1 and 3
   : 1 resonances it is subcritical, and while the inversion asymmetry
   extends the ranges of resonant solutions in the 1 : 1 and 3 : 1
   resonances, it has no effect on the 2 : 1 resonance range. We conclude
   by discussing a few open questions.}},

Title = {{Tension-Sensitive Actin Assembly Supports Contractility at the
   Epithelial Zonula Adherens}},
Journal = {{CURRENT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{1689-1699}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Actomyosin-based contractility acts on cadherin junctions to
   support tissue integrity and morphogenesis. The actomyosin apparatus of
   the epithelial zonula adherens (ZA) is built by coordinating junctional
   actin assembly with Myosin II activation. However, the physical
   interaction between Myosin and actin filaments that is necessary for
   contractility can induce actin filament turnover, potentially
   compromising the contractile apparatus itself.
   Results: We now identify tension-sensitive actin assembly as one
   cellular solution to this design paradox. We show that junctional actin
   assembly is maintained by contractility in established junctions and
   increases when contractility is stimulated. The underlying mechanism
   entails the tension-sensitive recruitment of vinculin to the ZA.
   Vinculin, in turn, directly recruits Mena/VASP proteins to support
   junctional actin assembly. By combining strategies that uncouple
   Mena/VASP from vinculin or ectopically target Mena/VASP to junctions, we
   show that tension-sensitive actin assembly is necessary for junctional
   integrity and effective contractility at the ZA.
   Conclusions: We conclude that tension-sensitive regulation of actin
   assembly represents a mechanism for epithelial cells to resolve
   potential design contradictions that are inherent in the way that the
   junctional actomyosin system is assembled. This emphasizes that
   maintenance and regulation of the actin scaffolds themselves influence
   how cells generate contractile tension.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Chronic adipose tissue inflammation and its associated adipokines have
   been linked to the development of osteoarthritis (OA). It has been shown
   that caloric restriction may decrease body mass index and adiposity. The
   objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of lifelong
   caloric restriction on bone morphology, joint inflammation, and
   spontaneously occurring OA development in aged mice. C57BL/NIA mice were
   fed either a calorie-restricted (CR) or ad libitum (AL) diet starting at
   14 weeks of age. All mice were sacrificed at 24 months of age. Adipose
   tissue and knee joints were then harvested. Bone parameters of the
   joints were analyzed by micro-CT. OA and joint synovitis were determined
   using histology and semiquantitative analysis. Lifelong caloric
   restriction did not alter the severity of OA development in C57BL/NIA
   aged mice, and there was no difference in the total joint Mankin score
   between CR and AL groups (p=0.99). Mice also exhibited similar levels of
   synovitis (p=0.54). The bone mineral density of the femur and the tibia
   was comparable between the groups with a small increase in cancellous
   bone volume fraction in the lateral femoral condyle of the CR group
   compared with the AL group. Lifelong caloric restriction did not alter
   the incidence of OA or joint synovitis in C57BL/NIA mice, indicating
   that a reduction of caloric intake alone was not sufficient to prevent
   spontaneous age-related OA. Nonetheless, early initiation of CR
   continued throughout a life span did not negatively impact bone
   structural properties.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled flows through and over permeable layers occur in a variety of
   natural phenomena including turbulent flows over submerged vegetation.
   In this work, we employ a two-domain approach to model flow through and
   over submerged canopies. The model, amenable of a closed-form solution,
   couples the log-law and the Darcy-Brinkman equation, and is
   characterized by a novel representation of the drag force which does not
   rely on a parametrization through an unknown drag coefficient. This
   approach limits to one, i.e., the obstruction permeability, the number
   of free parameters. Analytical expressions for the average velocity
   profile through and above the canopies, volumetric flow rate,
   penetration length, and canopy shear layer parameter are obtained in
   terms of the canopy layer effective permeability. The model suggests
   that appropriately rescaled velocities in the canopy and surface layers
   follow two different scaling laws. The analytical predictions match with
   the experimental data collected by Ghisalberti and Nepf (2004) and Nepf
   et al. (2007).

Abstract = {{We present a fast, wide-field holography system for detecting
   photothermally excited gold nanospheres with combined quantitative phase
   imaging. An interferometric photothermal optical lock-in approach (POLI)
   is shown to improve SNR for detecting nanoparticles (NPs) on multiple
   substrates, including a monolayer of NPs on a silanized coverslip, and
   NPs bound to live cells. Furthermore, the set up allowed for
   co-registered quantitative phase imaging (QPI) to be acquired in an
   off-axis holographic set-up. An SNR of 103 was obtained for NP-tagging
   of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in live cells with a 3 second
   acquisition, while an SNR of 47 was seen for 20 ms acquisition. An
   analysis of improvements in SNR due to averaging multiple frames is
   presented, which suggest that residual photothermal signal can be a
   limiting factor. The combination of techniques allows for high
   resolution imaging of cell structure via QPI with the ability to
   identify receptor expression via POLI. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Title = {{Phenotypic Signatures Arising from Unbalanced Bacterial Growth}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Fluctuations in the growth rate of a bacterial culture during unbalanced
   growth are generally considered undesirable in quantitative studies of
   bacterial physiology. Under well-controlled experimental conditions,
   however, these fluctuations are not random but instead reflect the
   interplay between intra-cellular networks underlying bacterial growth
   and the growth environment. Therefore, these fluctuations could be
   considered quantitative phenotypes of the bacteria under a specific
   growth condition. Here, we present a method to identify ``phenotypic
   signatures{''} by time-frequency analysis of unbalanced growth curves
   measured with high temporal resolution. The signatures are then applied
   to differentiate amongst different bacterial strains or the same strain
   under different growth conditions, and to identify the essential
   architecture of the gene network underlying the observed growth
   dynamics. Our method has implications for both basic understanding of
   bacterial physiology and for the classification of bacterial strains.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional therapy for malignant glioma (MG) fails to specifically
   eliminate tumor cells, resulting in toxicity that limits therapeutic
   efficacy. In contrast, antibody-based immunotherapy uses the immune
   system to eliminate tumor cells with exquisite specificity. Increased
   understanding of the pathobiology of MG and the profound
   immunosuppression present among patients with MG has revealed several
   biologic targets amenable to antibody-based immunotherapy. Novel
   antibody engineering techniques allow for the production of fully human
   antibodies or antibody fragments with vastly reduced antigen-binding
   dissociation constants, increasing safety when used clinically as
   therapeutics. In this report, we summarize the use of antibody-based
   immunotherapy for MG. Approaches currently under investigation include
   the use of antibodies or antibody fragments to: (1) redirect immune
   effector cells to target tumor mutations, (2) inhibit immunosuppressive
   signals and thereby stimulate an immunological response against tumor
   cells, and (3) provide costimulatory signals to evoke immunologic
   targeting of tumor cells. These approaches demonstrate highly compelling
   safety and efficacy for the treatment of MG, providing a viable adjunct
   to current standard-of-care therapy for MG. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Synthetic Zinc Finger Proteins: The Advent of Targeted Gene Regulation
   and Genonne Modification Technologies}},

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: The understanding of gene regulation and the structure and
   function of the human genome increased dramatically at the end of the
   20th century. Yet the technologies for manipulating the genome have been
   slower to develop. For instance, the field of gene therapy has been
   focused on correcting genetic diseases and augmenting tissue repair for
   more than 40 years. However, with the exception of a few very low
   efficiency approaches, conventional genetic engineering methods have
   only been able to add auxiliary genes to cells. This has been a
   substantial obstacle to the clinical success of gene therapies and has
   also led to severe unintended consequences in several cases. Therefore,
   technologies that facilitate the precise modification of cellular
   genomes have diverse and significant implications in many facets of
   research and are essential for translating the products of the Genomic
   Revolution into tangible benefits for medicine and biotechnology. To
   address this need, in the 1990s, we embarked on a mission to develop
   technologies for engineering protein DNA interactions with the aim of
   creating custom tools capable of targeting any DNA sequence. Our goal
   has been to allow researchers to reach into genomes to specifically
   regulate, knock out, or replace any gene. To realize these goals, we
   initially focused on understanding and manipulating zinc finger
   proteins. In particular, we sought to create a simple and
   straightforward method that enables unspecialized laboratories to
   engineer custom DNA-modifying proteins using only defined modular
   components, a web-based utility, and standard recombinant DNA
   technology. Two significant challenges we faced were (i) the development
   of zinc finger domains that target sequences not recognized by naturally
   occurring zinc finger proteins and (ii) determining how individual zinc
   finger domains could be tethered together as polydactyl proteins to
   recognize unique locations within complex genomes. We and others have
   since used this modular assembly method to engineer artificial proteins
   and enzymes that activate, repress, or create defined changes to
   user-specified genes in human cells, plants, and other organisms. We
   have also engineered novel methods for externally controlling protein
   activity and delivery, as well as developed new strategies for the
   directed evolution of protein and enzyme function. This Account
   summarizes our work in these areas and highlights independent studies
   that have successfully used the modular assembly approach to create
   proteins with novel function. We also discuss emerging alternative
   methods for genomic targeting, induding transcription activator-like
   effectors (TALEs) and CRISPR/Cas systems, and how they complement the
   synthetic zinc finger protein technology.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Unresectable chest wall recurrences of breast cancer (CWR) in
   heavily pretreated patients are especially difficult to treat. We
   hypothesised that thermally enhanced drug delivery using low temperature
   liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD), given with mild local hyperthermia (MLHT),
   will be safe and effective in this population.
   Patients and methods: This paper combines the results of two similarly
   designed phase I trials. Eligible CWR patients had progressed on the
   chest wall after prior hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.
   Patients were to get six cycles of LTLD every 21-35 days, followed
   immediately by chest wall MLHT for 1 hour at 40-42 degrees C. In the
   first trial 18 subjects received LTLD at 20, 30, or 40 mg/m(2); in the
   second trial, 11 subjects received LTLD at 40 or 50 mg/m(2).
   Results: The median age of all 29 patients enrolled was 57 years.
   Thirteen patients (45\%) had distant metastases on enrolment. Patients
   had received a median dose of 256 mg/m(2) of prior anthracyclines and a
   median dose of 61 Gy of prior radiation. The median number of study
   treatments that subjects completed was four. The maximum tolerated dose
   was 50 mg/m(2), with seven subjects (24\%) developing reversible grade
   3-4 neutropenia and four (14\%) reversible grade 3-4 leucopenia. The
   rate of overall local response was 48\% (14/29, 95\% CI: 30-66\%), with.
   five patients (17\%) achieving complete local responses and nine
   patients (31\%) having partial local responses.
   Conclusion: LTLD at 50 mg/m(2) and MLHT is safe. This combined therapy
   produces objective responses in heavily pretreated CWR patients. Future
   work should test thermally enhanced LTLD delivery in a less advanced
   patient population.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a clinical therapy for chronic,
   neuropathic pain, but an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms
   underlying SCS contributes to the lack of improvement in SCS efficacy
   over time. To study the mechanisms underlying SCS, we constructed a
   biophysically based network model of the dorsal horn circuit consisting
   of interconnected dorsal horn interneurons and a wide-dynamic range
   (WDR) projection neuron and representations of both local and surround
   receptive field inhibition. We validated the network model by
   reproducing cellular and network responses relevant to pain processing
   including wind-up, A fiber-mediated inhibition, and surround receptive
   field inhibition. We then simulated the effects of SCS on the activity
   of the WDR projection neuron and found that the response of the model
   WDR neuron to SCS depends on the SCS frequency; SCS frequencies of
   30-100 Hz maximally inhibited the model WDR neuron, while frequencies
   under 30 Hz and over 100 Hz excited the model WDR neuron. We also
   studied the impacts on the effects of SCS of loss of inhibition due to
   the loss of either GABA or KCC2 function. Reducing the influence of
   local and surround GABAergic interneurons by weakening their inputs or
   their connections to the WDR neuron and shifting the anionic reversal
   potential of the WDR neurons upward each reduced the range of optimal
   SCS frequencies and changed the frequency at which SCS had a maximal
   effect. The results of this study provide insights into the mechanisms
   of SCS and pave the way for improved SCS parameter selection.}},

Abstract = {{The radiative processes associated with fluorophores and other radiating
   systems can be profoundly modified by their interaction with
   nanoplasmonic structures. Extreme electromagnetic environments can be
   created in plasmonic nanostructures or nanocavities, such as within the
   nanoscale gap region between two plasmonic nanoparticles, where the
   illuminating optical fields and the density of radiating modes are
   dramatically enhanced relative to vacuum. Unraveling the various
   mechanisms present in such coupled systems, and their impact on
   spontaneous emission and other radiative phenomena, however, requires a
   suitably reliable and precise means of tuning the plasmon resonance of
   the nanostructure while simultaneously preserving the electromagnetic
   characteristics of the enhancement region. Here, we achieve this control
   using a plasmonic platform consisting of colloidally synthesized
   nanocubes electromagnetically coupled to a metallic film. Each nanocube
   resembles a nanoscale patch antenna (or nanopatch) whose plasmon
   resonance can be changed independent of its local field enhancement. By
   varying the size of the nanopatch, we tune the plasmonic resonance by
   similar to 200 nm, encompassing the excitation, absorption, and emission
   spectra corresponding to Cy5 fluorophores embedded within the gap region
   between nanopatch and film. By sweeping the plasmon resonance but
   keeping the field enhancements roughly fixed, we demonstrate
   fluorescence enhancements exceeding a factor of 30 000 with
   detector-limited enhancements of the spontaneous emission rate by a
   factor of 74. The experiments are supported by finite-element
   simulations that reveal design rules for optimized fluorescence
   enhancement or large Purcell factors.}},

Abstract = {{Preferential flow in hillslope systems through subsurface networks
   developed from a range of botanical, faunal and geophysical processes
   have been observed and inferred for decades and may provide a large
   component of the bulk transport of water and solutes. However, our
   dominant paradigm for understanding and modelling hillslope hydrologic
   processes is still based on the Darcy-Richards matric flow framework,
   now with a set of additional methods to attempt to reproduce some of the
   aggregate function of the two-phase system of network and matrix flow.
   We call for a community effort to design and implement a set of well
   planned experiments in different natural and constructed hillslopes,
   coupled with the development of new theory and methods to explicitly
   incorporate and couple the co-evolution of subsurface flow networks as
   intrinsic components of hydrological, ecological and geomorphic systems.
   This is a major community challenge that can now benefit from new
   experimental infrastructure, renewal of older infrastructure and recent
   advances in sensor systems and computational capacity but will also
   require a sustained and organized interdisciplinary approach. Copyright

Abstract = {{Recently proposed power-gating structures for intermediate power-off
   modes offer significant power saving benefits as they reduce the leakage
   power during short periods of inactivity. Even though they are very
   effective for reducing static power consumption, their reliable
   operation can be compromised by process variations and manufacturing
   defects. In this paper, we propose a signature analysis technique to
   efficiently test power-gating structures that provide intermediate
   power-off modes. Based on this technique, a methodology to repair
   catastrophic and parametric faults, and to tolerate process variations
   is presented. For testing and repairing multimode power switches, we
   propose a robust built-in self-test and built-in self-repair scheme that
   reduces test cost and obviates additional manufacturing steps for
   post-silicon repair. Simulation results highlight the low-cost and
   effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting, diagnosing, and
   repairing defects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an information potential method for integrated path
   planning and control. The method is applicable to unicycle robotic
   sensors deployed to classify multiple targets in an obstacle-populated
   environment. A new navigation function, referred to as information
   potential, is generated from the target conditional mutual information,
   and used to design a closed-loop stable switched control law. The
   information potential is shown to obey the properties of potential
   navigation functions and to enable measurements that maximize the
   information value over time. The information potential is also used to
   construct a local roadmap for escaping local minima. The properties and
   computational complexity of the local roadmap algorithm are analyzed.
   Numerical simulation results show that the method outperforms other
   strategies, such as rapidly exploring random trees and classical
   potential field methods.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) to black carbon is
   a well-studied phenomenon. One emerging class of engineered black carbon
   materials are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Little research
   has investigated the potential of SWNT to adsorb and sequester HOCs in
   complex environmental systems. This study addressed the capacity of
   SWNT, amended to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated New Bedford
   Harbor (NBH) sediment, to reduce the toxicity and bioaccumulation of
   these HOCs to benthic organisms. Overall, SWNT amendments increased the
   survival of two benthic estuarine invertebrates, Americamysis bahia and
   Ampelisca abdita, and reduced the accumulation of PCBs to the benthic
   polychaete, Nereis virens. Reduction in PCB bioaccumulation by SWNT was
   independent of K-ow. Further, passive sampling-based estimates of
   interstitial water concentrations indicated that SWNT reduced PCB
   bioavailability. Results from this study suggest that SWNT are a good
   adsorbent for PCBs and might be useful for remediation in the future
   once SWNT manufacturing technology improves and costs decrease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for
   movement disorders and a promising therapy for treating epilepsy and
   psychiatric disorders. Despite its clinical success, complications
   including infections and mis-programing following surgical replacement
   of the battery-powered implantable pulse generator adversely impact the
   safety profile of this therapy. We sought to decrease power consumption
   and extend battery life by modifying the electrode geometry to increase
   stimulation efficiency. The specific goal of this study was to determine
   whether electrode contact perimeter or area had a greater effect on
   increasing stimulation efficiency. Approach. Finite-element method (FEM)
   models of eight prototype electrode designs were used to calculate the
   electrode access resistance, and the FEM models were coupled with cable
   models of passing axons to quantify stimulation efficiency. We also
   measured in vitro the electrical properties of the prototype electrode
   designs and measured in vivo the stimulation efficiency following acute
   implantation in anesthetized cats. Main results. Area had a greater
   effect than perimeter on altering the electrode access resistance;
   electrode (access or dynamic) resistance alone did not predict
   stimulation efficiency because efficiency was dependent on the shape of
   the potential distribution in the tissue; and, quantitative assessment
   of stimulation efficiency required consideration of the effects of the
   electrode-tissue interface impedance. Significance. These results
   advance understanding of the features of electrode geometry that are
   important for designing the next generation of efficient DBS electrodes.}},

Title = {{Analysis of deep brain stimulation electrode characteristics for neural
   recording}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems have the
   potential to optimize treatment of movement disorders by enabling
   automatic adjustment of stimulation parameters based on a feedback
   signal. Evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) and local field
   potentials (LFPs) recorded from the DBS electrode may serve as suitable
   closed-loop control signals. The objective of this study was to
   understand better the factors that influence ECAP and LFP recording,
   including the physical presence of the electrode, the geometrical
   dimensions of the electrode, and changes in the composition of the
   peri-electrode space across recording conditions. Approach. Coupled
   volume conductor-neuron models were used to calculate single-unit
   activity as well as ECAP responses and LFP activity from a population of
   model thalamic neurons. Main results. Comparing ECAPs and LFPs measured
   with and without the presence of the highly conductive recording
   contacts, we found that the presence of these contacts had a negligible
   effect on the magnitude of single-unit recordings, ECAPs (7\% RMS
   difference between waveforms), and LFPs (5\% change in signal
   magnitude). Spatial averaging across the contact surface decreased the
   ECAP magnitude in a phase-dependent manner (74\% RMS difference),
   resulting from a differential effect of the contact on the contribution
   from nearby or distant elements, and decreased the LFP magnitude (25\%
   change). Reductions in the electrode diameter or recording contact
   length increased signal energy and increased spatial sensitivity of
   single neuron recordings. Moreover, smaller diameter electrodes (500 m)
   were more selective for recording from local cells over passing axons,
   with the opposite true for larger diameters (1500 m). Changes in
   electrode dimensions had phase-dependent effects on ECAP
   characteristics, and generally had small effects on the LFP magnitude.
   ECAP signal energy and LFP magnitude decreased with tighter contact
   spacing (100 m), compared to the original dimensions (1500 m), with the
   opposite effect on the ECAP at longer contact-to-contact distances (2000
   m). Finally, acute edema reduced the single neuron and population ECAP
   signal energy, as well as LFP magnitude, and glial encapsulation had the
   opposite effect, after accounting for loss of cells in the
   peri-electrode space. Significance. This study determined recording
   conditions and electrode designs that influence ECAP and LFP recording
   fidelity.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging at long wavelengths, for example at terahertz and

   researchers(2,3) because of the great potential for applications ranging
   from security screening(4) and skin cancer detection(5) to all-weather
   navigation(6) and biodetection(7). Here, we design, fabricate and
   demonstrate active metamaterials that function as real-time tunable,
   spectrally sensitive spatial masks for terahertz imaging with only a
   single-pixel detector. A modulation technique permits imaging with
   negative mask values, which is typically difficult to achieve with
   intensity-based components. We demonstrate compressive techniques
   allowing the acquisition of high-frame-rate, high-fidelity images. Our
   system is all solid-state with no moving parts, yields improved
   signal-to-noise ratios over standard raster-scanning techniques(8), and
   uses a source orders of magnitude lower in power than conventional
   set-ups(9). The demonstrated imaging system establishes a new path for
   terahertz imaging that is distinct from existing focal-plane-array-based
   cameras.}},

Abstract = {{We report measurements of the X-ray expansion of the youngest Galactic
   supernova remnant, G1.9+0.3, using Chandra observations in 2007, 2009,
   and 2011. The measured rates strongly deviate from uniform expansion,
   decreasing radially by about 60\% along the X-ray bright SE-NW axis from
   0.84\% +/- 0.06\% yr(-1) to 0.52\% +/- 0.03\% yr(-1). This corresponds
   to undecelerated ages of 120-190 yr, confirming the young age of
   G1.9+0.3 and implying a significant deceleration of the blast wave. The
   synchrotron-dominated X-ray emission brightens at a rate of 1.9\% +/-
   0.4\% yr(-1). We identify bright outer and inner rims with the blast
   wave and reverse shock, respectively. Sharp density gradients in either
   the ejecta or ambient medium are required to produce the sudden
   deceleration of the reverse shock or the blast wave implied by the large
   spread in expansion ages. The blast wave could have been decelerated
   recently by an encounter with a modest density discontinuity in the
   ambient medium, such as may be found at a wind termination shock,
   requiring strong mass loss in the progenitor. Alternatively, the reverse
   shock might have encountered an order-of-magnitude density discontinuity
   within the ejecta, such as may be found in pulsating delayed-detonation
   Type Ia models. We demonstrate that the blast wave is much more
   decelerated than the reverse shock in these models for remnants at ages
   similar to G1.9+0.3. Similar effects may also be produced by dense
   shells possibly associated with high-velocity features in Type Ia
   spectra. Accounting for the asymmetry of G1.9+0.3 will require more
   realistic three-dimensional Type Ia models.}},

Abstract = {{Fibroadenomas are the most common breast tumors in women under 30 (refs.
   1,2). Exome sequencing of eight fibroadenomas with matching whole-blood
   samples revealed recurrent somatic mutations solely in MED12, which
   encodes a Mediator complex subunit. Targeted sequencing of an additional
   90 fibroadenomas confirmed highly frequent MED12 exon 2 mutations
   (58/98, 59\%) that are probably somatic, with 71\% of mutations
   occurring in codon 44. Using laser capture microdissection, we show that
   MED12 fibroadenoma mutations are present in stromal but not epithelial
   mammary cells. Expression profiling of MED12-mutated and wild-type
   fibroadenomas revealed that MED12 mutations are associated with
   dysregulated estrogen signaling and extracellular matrix organization.
   The fibroadenoma MED12 mutation spectrum is nearly identical to that of
   previously reported MED12 lesions in uterine leiomyoma but not those of
   other tumors. Benign tumors of the breast and uterus, both of which are
   key target tissues of estrogen, may thus share a common genetic basis
   underpinned by highly frequent and specific MED12 mutations.}},

Abstract = {{Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely used, noninvasive
   method for stimulating nervous tissue, yet its mechanisms of effect are
   poorly understood. Here we report new methods for studying the influence
   of TMS on single neurons in the brain of alert non-human primates. We
   designed a TMS coil that focuses its effect near the tip of a recording
   electrode and recording electronics that enable direct acquisition of
   neuronal signals at the site of peak stimulus strength minimally
   perturbed by stimulation artifact in awake monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We
   recorded action potentials within similar to 1 ms after 0.4-ms TMS
   pulses and observed changes in activity that differed significantly for
   active stimulation as compared with sham stimulation. This methodology
   is compatible with standard equipment in primate laboratories, allowing
   easy implementation. Application of these tools will facilitate the
   refinement of next generation TMS devices, experiments and treatment
   protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Hyaluronic acid (HA)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) composite hydrogels
   have been widely studied for both cell delivery and soft tissue
   regeneration applications. A very broad range of physical and biological
   properties have been engineered into HA-PEG hydrogels that may
   differentially affect cellular ``outcomes{''} of survival, synthesis and
   metabolism. The objective of this study was to rapidly screen multiple
   HA-PEG composite hydrogel formulations for an effect on matrix synthesis
   and behaviors of nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) cells
   of the intervertebral disc (IVD). A secondary objective was to apply
   artificial neural network analysis to identify relationships between
   HA-PEG composite hydrogel formulation parameters and biological outcome
   measures for each cell type of the IVD. Eight different hydrogels were
   developed from preparations of thiolated HA (HA-SH) and PEG vinylsulfone
   (PEG-VS) macromers, and used as substrates for NP and AF cell culture in
   vitro. Hydrogel mechanical properties ranged from 70 to 489 kPa
   depending on HA molecular weight, and measures of matrix synthesis,
   metabolite consumption and production and cell morphology were obtained
   to study relationships to hydrogel parameters. Results showed that NP
   and AF cell numbers were highest upon the HA-PEG hydrogels formed from
   the lower-molecular-weight HA, with evidence of higher sulfated
   glycosaminoglycan production also upon lower-HA-molecular-weight
   composite gels. All cells formed more multi-cell clusters upon any
   HA-PEG composite hydrogel as compared to gelatin substrates.
   Formulations were clustered into neurons based largely on their HA
   molecular weight, with few effects of PEG molecular weight observed on
   any measured parameters. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{752}},
Pages = {{22-38}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Self-propelled jumping upon drop coalescence has been observed on a
   variety of textured superhydrophobic surfaces, where the jumping motion
   follows the capillary-inertial velocity scaling as long as the drop
   radius is above a threshold. In this paper, we report an experimental
   study of the self-propelled jumping on a Leidenfrost surface, where the
   heated substrate gives rise to a vapour layer on which liquid drops
   float. For the coalescence of identical water drops, we have tested
   initial drop radii ranging from 20 to 500 mu m, where the lower bound is
   related to the spontaneous takeoff of individual drops and the upper
   bound to gravitational effects. Regardless of the approaching velocity
   prior to coalescence, the measured jumping velocity is around 0.2 when
   scaled by the capillary-inertial velocity. This constant non-dimensional
   velocity holds for the experimentally accessible range of drop radii,
   and we have found no cutoff radius for the scaling, in contrast to prior
   experiments on textured superhydrophobic surfaces. The Leidenfrost
   experiments quantitatively agree with our numerical simulations of drop
   coalescence on a flat surface with a contact angle of 180 degrees,
   suggesting that the cutoff is likely to be due to drop-surface
   interactions unique to the textured superhydrophobic surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Coalescing drops spontaneously jump out of plane on a variety of
   biological and synthetic superhydrophobic surfaces, with potential
   applications ranging from self-cleaning materials to self-sustained
   condensers. To investigate the mechanism of self-propelled jumping, we
   report three-dimensional phase-field simulations of two identical
   spherical drops coalescing on a flat surface with a contact angle of 180
   degrees. The numerical simulations capture the spontaneous jumping
   process, which follows the capillary-inertial scaling. The out-of-plane
   directionality is shown to result from the counter-action of the
   substrate to the impingement of the liquid bridge between the coalescing
   drops. A viscous cutoff to the capillary-inertial velocity scaling is
   identified when the Ohnesorge number of the initial drops is around 0.1,
   but the corresponding viscous cutoff radius is too small to be tested
   experimentally. Compared to experiments on both superhydrophobic and
   Leidenfrost surfaces, our simulations accurately predict the nearly
   constant jumping velocity of around 0.2 when scaled by the
   capillary-inertial velocity. By comparing the simulated drop coalescence
   processes with and without the substrate, we attribute this low
   non-dimensional velocity to the substrate intercepting only a small
   fraction of the expanding liquid bridge.}},

Title = {{A frame-invariant vector limiter for flux corrected nodal remap in
   arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian flow computations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{270}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a frame-invariant vector limiter for
   Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) numerical methods. Our approach relies on
   an objective vector projection, and, because of its intrinsic structure,
   the proposed approach can be generalized with ease to higher-order
   tensor fields.
   The proposed concept is applied to nodal finite element formulations and
   the so-called algebraic FCT paradigm, but the ideas pursued here are
   very general and also apply to more general instantiations of
   flux-corrected transport.
   Specifically, we consider the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
   equations of compressible inviscid flows. In addition to the geometric
   conservation law (GCL) and the local extreme diminishing (LED) property
   of the original scalar limiters, the proposed approach ensures frame
   invariance (objectivity) for vectors. Particularly, we use an ALE
   strategy based on a two-stage, Lagrangian plus mesh remap (data transfer
   based on conservative interpolation), in which remap and limiting are
   performed in a synchronized way. The proposed approach is however of
   general applicability, is not limited to a specific ALE implementation,
   and can easily be generalized to computations with standard (monolithic)
   ALE or Eulerian reference frames.
   The significance of the frame-invariant limiter for vectors is
   demonstrated in computations of compressible materials under extreme
   load conditions. Extensive testing in two and three dimensions
   demonstrates that the proposed limiter greatly enhances the robustness
   and reliability of the existing methods under typical computational
   scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Channel selection methods for the P300 Speller}},

Abstract = {{The P300 Speller brain-computer interface (BCI) allows a user to
   communicate without muscle activity by reading electrical signals on the
   scalp via electroencephalogram. Modern BCI systems use multiple
   electrodes ({''}channels{''}) to collect data, which has been shown to
   improve speller accuracy; however, system cost and setup time can
   increase substantially with the number of channels in use, so it is in
   the user's interest to use a channel set of modest size. This constraint
   increases the importance of using an effective channel set, but current
   systems typically utilize the same channel montage for each user. We
   examine the effect of active channel selection for individuals on
   speller performance, using generalized standard feature-selection
   methods, and present a new channel selection method, termed jumpwise
   regression, that extends the Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis
   classifier. Simulating the selections of each method on real P300
   Speller data, we obtain results demonstrating that active channel
   selection can improve speller accuracy for most users relative to a
   standard channel set, with particular benefit for users who experience
   low performance using the standard set. Of the methods tested, jumpwise
   regression offers accuracy gains similar to the best-performing
   feature-selection methods, and is robust enough for online use. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an electrolyte-based voltage tunable vanadium dioxide
   (VO2) memory metasurface. Large spatial scale, low voltage, non-volatile
   switching of terahertz (THz) metasurface resonances is achieved through
   voltage application using an ionic gel to drive the insulator-to-metal
   transition in an underlying VO2 layer. Positive and negative voltage
   application can selectively tune the metasurface resonance into the
   ``off{''} or ``on{''} state by pushing the VO2 into a more conductive or
   insulating regime respectively. Compared to graphene based control
   devices, the relatively long saturation time of resonance modification
   in VO2 based devices suggests that this voltage-induced switching
   originates primarily from electrochemical effects related to oxygen
   migration across the electrolyte-VO2 interface. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{The prevailing view is that we cannot witness biological evolution
   because it occurred on a time scale immensely greater than our lifetime.
   Here, we show that we can witness evolution in our lifetime by watching
   the evolution of the flying human-and-machine species: the airplane. We
   document this evolution, and we also predict it based on a physics
   principle: the constructal law. We show that the airplanes must obey
   theoretical allometric rules that unite them with the birds and other
   animals. For example, the larger airplanes are faster, more efficient as
   vehicles, and have greater range. The engine mass is proportional to the
   body size: this scaling is analogous to animal design, where the mass of
   the motive organs (muscle, heart, lung) is proportional to the body
   size. Large or small, airplanes exhibit a proportionality between wing
   span and fuselage length, and between fuel load and body size. The
   animal-design counterparts of these features are evident. The view that
   emerges is that the evolution phenomenon is broader than biological
   evolution. The evolution of technology, river basins, and animal design
   is one phenomenon, and it belongs in physics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Recent work has shown that Bi incorporation increases during molecular
   beam epitaxy (MBE) when surface processes are kinetically limited
   through increased growth rate. Herein we explore how the structural and
   optical properties of GaAs1-xBix films are modified when grown under
   conditions with varying degrees of kinetic limitations realized through
   growth temperature and growth rate changes. Within the typical window of
   MBE growth conditions for GaAs1-xBix, we compare films with similar
   (similar to 3\%) compositions grown under conditions of reduced kinetic
   limitations, i.e., relatively low gallium supersaturation achieved at
   higher temperatures (similar to 350 degrees C) and lower growth rates
   (similar to 0.5 mu m/h), to those grown farther from equilibrium,
   specifically, higher supersaturation achieved at lower growth
   temperatures (similar to 290 degrees C) and higher growth rates (similar
   to 1.4 mu m/h). Both the x-ray diffraction full width at half maximum of
   the omega-2theta scan and the 300K photoluminescence intensity increase
   when samples are grown under less kinetically limited conditions. We
   interpret these findings in relation to the incorporation of Bi-related
   microstructural defects that are more readily formed during less
   kinetically limited growth. These defects lead to enhanced luminescence
   efficiency due to the spatial localization of carriers. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Insights into the growth of high edge density carbon nanostructures were
   achieved by a systematic parametric study of plasma-enhanced chemical
   vapor deposition (PECVD). Such structures are important for electrode
   performance in a variety of applications such as supercapacitors, neural
   stimulation, and electrocatalysis. A morphological trend was observed as
   a function of temperature whereby graphenated carbon nanotubes (g-CNTs)
   emerged as an intermediate structure between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at
   lower temperatures and vertically oriented carbon nanosheets (CNS),
   composed of few-layered graphene, at higher temperatures. This is the
   first time that three distinct morphologies and dimensionalities of
   carbon nanostructures (i.e., ID CNTs, 2D CNSs, and 3D g-CNTs) have been
   synthesized in the same reaction chamber by varying only a single
   parameter (temperature). A design of experiments (DOE) approach was
   utilized to understand the range of growth permitted in a microwave
   PECVD reactor, with a focus on identifying graphenated carbon nanotube
   growth within the process space. Factors studied in the experimental
   design included temperature, gas ratio, catalyst thickness, pretreatment
   time, and deposition time. This procedure facilitates predicting and
   modeling high edge density carbon nanostructure characteristics under a
   complete range of growth conditions that yields various morphologies of
   nanoscale carbon. Aside from the morphological trends influenced by
   temperature, a relationship between deposition temperature and specific
   capacitance emerged from the DOE study. Transmission electron microscopy
   was also used to understand the morphology and microstructure of the
   various high edge density structures. From these results, a new graphene
   foliate formation mechanism is proposed for synthesis of g-CNTs in a
   single deposition process.}},

Abstract = {{Biological systems are exquisitely sensitive to the location and timing
   of physiologic cues and drugs. This spatiotemporal sensitivity presents
   opportunities for developing new therapeutic approaches. Polymer-based
   delivery systems are used extensively for attaining localized, sustained
   release of bioactive molecules. However, these devices typically are
   designed to achieve a constant rate of release. We hypothesized that it
   would be possible to create digital drug release, which could be
   accelerated and then switched back off, on demand, by applying
   ultrasound to disrupt ionically cross-linked hydrogels. We demonstrated
   that ultrasound does not permanently damage these materials but enables
   nearly digital release of small molecules, proteins, and condensed
   oligonucleotides. Parallel in vitro studies demonstrated that the
   concept of applying temporally short, high-dose ``bursts{''} of drug
   exposure could be applied to enhance the toxicity of mitoxantrone toward
   breast cancer cells. We thus used the hydrogel system in vivo to treat
   xenograft tumors with mitoxantrone, and found that daily
   ultrasound-stimulated drug release substantially reduced tumor growth
   compared with sustained drug release alone. This approach of digital
   drug release likely will be applicable to a broad variety of polymers
   and bioactive molecules, and is a potentially useful tool for studying
   how the timing of factor delivery controls cell fate in vivo.}},

Title = {{Comparing reference-based RNA-Seq mapping methods for non-human primate
   data}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The application of next-generation sequencing technology to
   gene expression quantification analysis, namely, RNA-Sequencing, has
   transformed the way in which gene expression studies are conducted and
   analyzed. These advances are of particular interest to researchers
   studying organisms with missing or incomplete genomes, as the need for
   knowledge of sequence information is overcome. De novo assembly methods
   have gained widespread acceptance in the RNA-Seq community for organisms
   with no true reference genome or transcriptome. While such methods have
   tremendous utility, computational cost is still a significant challenge
   for organisms with large and complex genomes.
   Results: In this manuscript, we present a comparison of four
   reference-based mapping methods for non-human primate data. We utilize
   TopHat2 and GSNAP for mapping to the human genome, and Bowtie2 and
   Stampy for mapping to the human genome and transcriptome for a total of
   six mapping approaches. For each of these methods, we explore mapping
   rates and locations, number of detected genes, correlations between
   computed expression values, and the utility of the resulting data for
   differential expression analysis.
   Conclusions: We show that reference-based mapping methods indeed have
   utility in RNA-Seq analysis of mammalian data with no true reference,
   and the details of mapping methods should be carefully considered when
   doing so. Critical algorithm features include short seed sequences, the
   allowance of mismatches, and the allowance of gapped alignments in
   addition to splice junction gaps. Such features facilitate sensitive
   alignment of non-human primate RNA-Seq data to a human reference.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the possibility to systematically steer the most probable
   escape paths (MPEPs) by adjusting relative noise intensities in
   dynamical systems that exhibit noise-induced escape from a metastable
   point via a saddle point. With the use of a geometric minimum action
   approach, an asymptotic theory is developed that is broadly applicable
   to fast-slow systems and shows the important role played by the
   nullcline associated with the fast variable in locating the MPEPs. A
   two-dimensional quadratic system is presented which permits analytical
   determination of both the MPEPs and associated action values. Analytical
   predictions agree with computed MPEPs, and both are numerically
   confirmed by constructing prehistory distributions directly from the

Title = {{A high-order hybrid finite difference-finite volume approach with
   application to inviscid compressible flow problems: A preliminary study}},

Abstract = {{A class of hybrid finite difference-finite volume (FD-FV) operators is
   recently developed as building blocks to solve one dimensional
   hyperbolic conservation laws when the solutions are smooth. This method
   differs from conventional finite difference (FD) or finite volume (FV)
   schemes in that both nodal values and cell-averaged values are
   considered as dependent variables and they are evolved in time. Under
   this framework, the 1D FD-FV methods: (1) are numerically conservative
   for cell averages; (2) have straightforward extension to high-order
   accuracy; and (3) have superior spatial accuracy property compared to
   most conventional FD or FV methods.
   This work extends the FD-FV approach in two aspects. The first extension
   is a WENO-type stabilization to enhance the nonlinear stability of
   sample high-order 1D FD-FV operators. In particular, numerical results
   show that when the solutions are smooth, the optimal order of accuracy
   (fifth-order) is achieved by the stabilized fourth-order FD-FV method;
   and it is also capable to handle problems with strongly discontinuous
   solutions.
   The second part of the paper extends a second-order FD-FV method to
   two-dimensional smooth problems. Both Cartesian grids and unstructured
   (triangular) grids are considered. In multiple dimensions, there are
   different choices of the collocation points of the nodal values, and
   they lead to different FD-FV schemes. This work develops a node-centered
   FD-FV scheme and an edge-centered FD-FV scheme on each type of grids,
   and their numerical performance are assessed and compared by solving
   benchmark flow problems with smooth solutions. In particular, the
   numerical examples confirm that the superior spatial accuracy property
   of the 1D FD-FV operators carries to two space dimensions on Cartesian
   grids. The present work focuses on two space dimensions, but the
   methodology extends naturally to three-dimensional Cartesian grids and
   tetrahedral grids. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment deposition and erosion by wind waves and tidal currents,
   mediated by bed sediment properties and by
   biostabilization/bioturbation, are key processes governing the dynamics
   of intertidal geomorphology. Here we develop and apply a method to
   estimate bed sediment properties, such as the settling velocity and the
   critical stress for erosion, providing a measure of the response of the
   system to the actual wave/tidal forcing. The method obtains estimates of
   sediment properties indirectly, by solving a sediment mass conservation
   equation for the water column, after explicitly modeling wave-and
   current-induced bottom shear stresses. We apply this approach using
   meteorological, tidal, and turbidimetric data from a network of sensors
   in the Venice Lagoon, yielding estimates which compare favorably with
   existing observations of sediment properties. Advantages of the method
   are that it does not interfere with the biological and physical status
   of the sediment surface and that it makes use of commonly available
   weather and wave observations. The proposed method lends itself to the
   continuous monitoring of sediment parameters at the system scale with
   limited operational effort when the sediment suspended in the water
   column is mostly originated by local resuspension, such as in the case
   of wave-dominated estuaries.}},

Abstract = {{Plant hydraulic traits have been conjectured to be coordinated, thereby
   providing plants with a balanced hydraulic system that protects them
   from cavitation while allowing an efficient transport of water necessary
   for photosynthesis. In particular, observations suggest correlations
   between the water potentials at which xylem cavitation impairs water
   movement and the one at stomatal closure, and between maximum xylem and
   stomatal conductances, begging the question as to whether such
   coordination emerges as an optimal water-use strategy under
   unpredictable rainfall. Here mean transpiration < E > is used as a proxy
   for long-term plant fitness and its variations as a function of the
   water potentials at 50\% loss of stem conductivity due to cavitation and
   at 90\% stomatal closure are explored. It is shown that coordination
   between these hydraulic traits is necessary to maximize < E >, with
   rainfall patterns altering the optimal range of trait values. In
   contrast, coordination between ecosystem-level conductances appears not
   necessary to maximize < E >. The optimal trait ranges are wider under
   drier than under mesic conditions, suggesting that in semiarid systems
   different water use strategies may be equally successful. Comparison
   with observations across species from a range of ecosystems confirms
   model predictions, indicating that the coordinated functioning of plant
   organs might indeed emerge from an optimal response to rainfall
   variability.}},

Abstract = {{The soil moisture-rainfall feedback (SMRF) may significantly impact
   hydro-climatic dynamics, inducing persistent weather conditions that are
   responsible for prolonged droughts or abnormally wet states. However,
   externally driven seasonal variability in rainfall and potential
   evapotranspiration, with the associated patterns of wet and dry
   conditions, may both interact with such an SMRF. In this study, seasonal
   variations in radiation and precipitation forcing are included in a
   stochastic SMRF model with the assumption of a soil moisture-dependent
   average rainfall frequency to explore their effects on the soil moisture
   probabilistic structure. The theoretical model results, based on a
   parameterization using data for soil moisture and climate in Illinois,
   show that average rainfall frequency peaks in late spring when both the
   soil condition and the SMRF strength favor convective rainfall
   triggering. Under such conditions, the soil moisture tends to exhibit
   bimodal behavior until the SMRF strength becomes weak again toward the
   end of the growing season. Such a behavior is reminiscent of the
   dynamics of a system undergoing a periodic, stochastically forced
   pitchfork bifurcation. The presence of bimodal soil moisture behavior is
   also verified using nonparametric statistical tests on soil moisture
   data. The analysis of wet-to-wet and dry-to-dry soil moisture
   transitions in the joint probability distribution of soil moisture
   further corroborates the presence of hydroclimatic persistence in the
   spring-to-summer transition.}},

Abstract = {{In modern IT systems, data backup and restore operations are essential
   for providing protection against data loss from both natural and
   man-made incidents. On the other hand, data backup and restore
   operations can be resource-intensive and lead to performance
   degradation, or may require the system to be offline entirely.
   Therefore, it is important to properly choose backup and restore
   techniques and policies to ensure adequate data protection while
   minimizing the impact on system availability and performance. In this
   paper, we present an analytical modeling approach for such a purpose. We
   study a file service system that undergoes periodic data backups, and
   investigate metrics concerning system availability, data loss and
   rejection of user requests. To obtain the metrics, we combine a variety
   of model types, including Markov chains, queuing networks and Stochastic
   Reward Nets, to construct a set of analytical models that capture the
   operational details of the system. We then compute the metrics of
   interest under different backup/restore techniques, policies, and
   workload scenarios. The numerical results allow us to compare the
   effects of different backup/restore techniques and policies in terms of
   the tradeoff between protective power and impact on system performance
   and availability.}},

Abstract = {{P300 spellers provide a means of communication for individuals with
   severe physical limitations, especially those with locked-in syndrome,
   such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, P300 speller use is
   still limited by relatively low communication rates due to the multiple
   data measurements that are required to improve the signal-to-noise ratio
   of event-related potentials for increased accuracy. Therefore, the
   amount of data collection has competing effects on accuracy and spelling
   speed. Adaptively varying the amount of data collection prior to
   character selection has been shown to improve spelling accuracy and
   speed. The goal of this study was to optimize a previously developed
   dynamic stopping algorithm that uses a Bayesian approach to control data
   collection by incorporating a priori knowledge via a language model.
   Participants (n=17) completed online spelling tasks using the dynamic
   stopping algorithm, with and without a language model. The addition of
   the language model resulted in improved participant performance from a
   mean theoretical bit rate of 46.12 bits/min at 88.89\% accuracy to 54.42
   bits/min () at 90.36\% accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to simulate
   the evolution of tropical storm Ivan (2004) in the southeast United
   States using both the Yonsei University (YSU) and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic
   (MYJ) boundary-layer parametrizations. In contrast to tropical cyclone
   (TC) simulations over the ocean, the effect of the surface layer becomes
   secondary for a dissipating hurricane along its terrestrial track.
   Although these two schemes can reproduce Ivan reasonably well, our
   results suggest that the mixing properties for damped mechanical
   turbulent conditions (weakly stable) are strongly underestimated by both
   parametrizations. This underestimation impacts the thermodynamic
   properties of the storm, leading to significant differences in the storm
   areal extent and the simulated precipitation fields. Suggestions for
   further improvements are provided.
   An evaluation of the impact of using or not using a convective
   parametrization, specifically the Kain-Fritsch (KF) scheme, at 3 km grid
   spacing shows marginal impact on storm coverage, intensity and
   precipitation, except for the presence of widespread light rainfall in
   the Piedmont east of the mountains when the KF is employed. Analysis of
   the thermal structure of the simulated storm indicates that, in the
   inner-storm region, the KF is either not activated or primarily produces
   (parametrized) shallow convection. As a result, the net heating tendency
   associated with adiabatic and diabatic processes is almost unaltered
   inside the storm, together with a nearly equivalent surface momentum
   sink, leading to similar storm areal extent and intensity. Light
   rainfall to the east of the mountains can be due to the trigger
   mechanism of KF, which depends on boundary-layer convergence, forcing
   parametrized deep convection near the coast, where surface roughness
   changes enhance convergence.}},

Abstract = {{We integrate the all-electron electronic structure code FHI-aims into

   offers particularly efficient access to exact exchange and second order
   perturbation theory, rendering the established QM/MM setup an ideal tool

Abstract = {{Psychological stress contributes to the onset and exacerbation of nearly
   all neuropsychiatric disorders. Individual differences in
   stress-regulatory circuits can therefore dramatically affect
   vulnerability to these illnesses. Here we identify neural circuit
   mechanisms underlying individual differences in vulnerability to stress
   using a murine model of chronic social defeat stress. In chronically
   stressed mice, we find that the degree of prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   control of amygdala activity predicts stress susceptibility in
   individual mice. Critically, we also find that individual differences in
   PFC activation (that is, reactivity) during exposure to an aggressor
   mouse predict the emergence stress-induced behavioural deficits in
   stress-naive mice. Finally, we show that naturally occurring differences
   in PFC reactivity directly correspond to the intrinsic firing rate of
   PFC neurons. This demonstrates that naturally occurring differences in
   PFC function underlie individual differences in vulnerability to stress,
   raising the hypothesis that PFC modulation may prevent stress-induced
   psychiatric disorders.}},

Title = {{Investigation of Deep Brain Stimulation Mechanisms During Implantable
   Pulse Generator Replacement Surgery}},
Journal = {{NEUROMODULATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{419-424}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundDirect testing of deep brain stimulation (DBS) mechanisms in
   humans is needed to assess therapy and to understand stimulation
   effects.
   ObjectiveWe developed an innovative paradigm for investigation of DBS on
   human movement disorders. Temporary connection to the DBS electrode
   during implantable pulse generator (IPG) replacement permitted analysis
   of novel patterns of stimulation on motor symptoms, which could enhance
   efficacy and improve battery life.
   Materials and MethodsPatients enrolled in this prospective,
   Institutional Review Board-approved study underwent IPG replacement
   using local (monitored) anesthesia. Following device explant, the DBS
   electrode was connected to an external, isolated electrical stimulator
   using a sterile adapter cable. Different temporal patterns of
   stimulation were delivered while quantifying upper-extremity tremor
   (tri-axial accelerometry) or bradykinesia (finger-tapping). Upon
   experiment completion, the new IPG was implanted.
   ResultsAmong 159 IPG replacements from 2005 to 2011, 56 patients agreed
   to the research study (16 essential tremor {[}ET], 31 Parkinson's
   disease {[}PD], 5 mixed ET/PD tremor, 3 multiple sclerosis, 1
   tremor/myoclonus). Surgical procedures were extended by 42 8.2min in 37
   patients completing the study. Motor symptoms varied with stimulation
   pattern, with some patterns showing improved tremor or bradykinesia
   control. No postoperative infections or complications were observed in
   the 159 patients.
   ConclusionIPG replacement occurs when the DBS/brain interface is stable
   and patients demonstrate symptom reduction with known stimulation
   parameters. Conducting research at this time point avoids DBS implant
   issues, including temporary microlesion effects, fluctuating electrode
   impedances, and technical limitations of contemporary IPGs, providing
   advantageous conditions to conduct translational DBS research with
   minimal additional risk to research subjects.}},

Title = {{A Novel Model Incorporating Two Variability Sources for Describing Motor
   Evoked Potentials}},
Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{541-552}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) play a pivotal role in
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), e.g., for determining the motor
   threshold and probing cortical excitability. Sampled across the range of
   stimulation strengths, MEPs outline an input-output (IO) curve, which is
   often used to characterize the corticospinal tract. More detailed
   understanding of the signal generation and variability of MEPs would
   provide insight into the underlying physiology and aid correct
   statistical treatment of MEP data.
   Methods: A novel regression model is tested using measured IO data of
   twelve subjects. The model splits MEP variability into two independent
   contributions, acting on both sides of a strong sigmoidal nonlinearity
   that represents neural recruitment. Traditional sigmoidal regression
   with a single variability source after the nonlinearity is used for
   comparison.
   Results: The distribution of MEP amplitudes varied across different
   stimulation strengths, violating statistical assumptions in traditional
   regression models. In contrast to the conventional regression model, the
   dual variability source model better described the IO characteristics
   including phenomena such as changing distribution spread and skewness
   along the IO curve.
   Conclusions: MEP variability is best described by two sources that most
   likely separate variability in the initial excitation process from
   effects occurring later on. The new model enables more accurate and
   sensitive estimation of the IO curve characteristics, enhancing its
   power as a detection tool, and may apply to other brain stimulation
   modalities. Furthermore, it extracts new information from the IO data
   concerning the neural variability-information that has previously been
   treated as noise. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{13, SI}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{C-4 photosynthesis evolved independently numerous times, probably in
   response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but also to high
   temperatures and aridity, which enhance water losses through
   transpiration. Here, the environmental factors controlling stomatal
   behaviour of leaf-level carbon and water exchange were examined across
   the evolutionary continuum from C-3 to C-4 photosynthesis at current
   (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and low (280 mu mol mol(-1)) atmospheric CO2
   conditions. To this aim, a stomatal optimization model was further
   developed to describe the evolutionary continuum from C-3 to C-4 species
   within a unified framework. Data on C-3, three categories of C-3-C-4
   intermediates, and C-4 Flaveria species were used to parameterize the
   stomatal model, including parameters for the marginal water use
   efficiency and the efficiency of the CO2-concentrating mechanism (or C-4
   pump); these two parameters are interpreted as traits reflecting the
   stomatal and photosynthetic adjustments during the C-3 to C-4
   transformation. Neither the marginal water use efficiency nor the C-4
   pump strength changed significantly from C-3 to early C-3-C-4
   intermediate stages, but both traits significantly increased between
   early C-3-C-4 intermediates and the C-4-like intermediates with an
   operational C-4 cycle. At low CO2, net photosynthetic rates showed
   continuous increases from a C-3 state, across the intermediates and
   towards C-4 photosynthesis, but only C-4-like intermediates and C-4
   species (with an operational C-4 cycle) had higher water use
   efficiencies than C-3 Flaveria. The results demonstrate that both the
   marginal water use efficiency and the C-4 pump strength increase in C-4
   Flaveria to improve their photosynthesis and water use efficiency
   compared with C-3 species. These findings emphasize that the advantage
   of the early intermediate stages is predominantly carbon based, not
   water related.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) continue to show strong promise as the channel
   material for an aggressively sailed, high-performance transistor
   technology. However, there has been concern regarding the contact
   resistance (R-c) in CNT field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) limiting the
   ultimate performance, especially at scaled contact lengths. In this
   work, the contact resistance in CNTFETs is defined in the context of a
   high-performance scaled transistor, including how the demonstrated R-c
   relates to technology targets. The impact of different source/drain
   contact metals (Pd, Pt, Au, Rh, Ni, and Ti) on the scaling of R-c versus
   contact length is presented. It is discovered that the most optimal
   contact metal at long contact lengths (Pd) is not necessarily the best
   for scaled devices, where a newly explored scaled metal contact, Rh,
   yields the best scaling trend. When extrapolated for a sub-10 nm
   transistor technology, these results show that the R-c in scaled CNTFETs
   is within a factor of 2 of the technology target with much potential for
   improvement through enhanced understanding and engineering of transport
   at the metal-CNT Interface.}},

Title = {{Assessment of volumetric noise and resolution performance for linear and

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: For nonlinear iterative image reconstructions (IR), the
   computed tomography (CT) noise and resolution properties can depend on
   the specific imaging conditions, such as lesion contrast and image noise
   level. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a reliable method to
   measure the noise and resolution properties under clinically relevant
   conditions. This study aimed to develop a robust methodology to measure
   the three-dimensional CT noise and resolution properties under such
   conditions and to provide guidelines to achieve desirable levels of
   accuracy and precision.
   Methods: The methodology was developed based on a previously reported CT
   image quality phantom. In this methodology, CT noise properties are
   measured in the uniform region of the phantom in terms of a task-based
   3D noise-power spectrum (NPStask). The in-plane resolution properties
   are measured in terms of the task transfer function (TTF) by applying a
   radial edge technique to the rod inserts in the phantom. The z-direction
   resolution properties are measured from a supplemental phantom, also in
   terms of the TTF. To account for the possible nonlinearity of IR, the
   NPStask is measured with respect to the noise magnitude, and the TTF
   with respect to noise magnitude and edge contrast. To determine the
   accuracy and precision of the methodology, images of known noise and The
   resolution properties were simulated. The NPStask and TTF were measured
   on the simulated images and compared to the truth, with criteria
   established to achieve NPStask and TTF measurements with <10\% error. To
   demonstrate the utility of this methodology, measurements were performed
   on a commercial CT system using five dose levels, two slice thicknesses,
   and three reconstruction algorithms (filtered backprojection, FBP;
   iterative reconstruction in imaging space, IRIS; and sinogram affirmed
   iterative reconstruction with strengths of 5, SAFIRE5).
   Results: To achieve NPStask measurements with <10\% error, the number of
   regions of interest needed to be greater than 65. To achieve TTF
   measurements with <10\% error, the contrast-to-noise ratio of the edge
   needed to be >= 15, achievable by averaging multiple slices across the
   same edge. The NPStask measured on a commercial CT system showed IR's
   reduced noise (IRIS, 30\% and SAFIRE5, 55\%) and ``waxier{''} texture
   (peak frequencies: FBP, 0.25 mm(-1); IRIS, 0.23 mm(-1); and SAFIRE5,
   0.16 mm(-1)). The TTF measured within the axial plane showed improved
   in-plane resolution with SAFIRE5 at the TTF 50\% frequency, f(50) (FBP,
   0.36-0.41 mm(-1); SAFIRE5, 0.37-0.46 mm(-1)). The TTF measured along the
   axial direction showed improved z-direction resolution with thinner
   slice thickness (f(50): 0.6 mm, 0.35-0.79 mm(-1); 1.5 mm, 0 22-0.3
   mm(-1)) and with SAFIRE5 (f(50): FBP, 0.35-0.52 mm(-1); SAFIRE5,
   0.42-0.79 mm(-1)). Both in-plane and z-direction resolution of SAFIRE5
   showed strong dependency on contrast, reflecting SAFIRE5's nonlinearity.
   Conclusions: A methodology was developed to measure three-dimensional CT
   noise and resolution properties for iterative reconstruction, especially
   at challenging measurement conditions with low contrast and high image
   noise. The methodology also demonstrated its utility for evaluating
   commercial CT systems. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in

Title = {{Patient-based estimation of organ dose for a population of 58 adult
   patients across 13 protocol categories}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to provide a comprehensive patient-specific
   organ dose estimation across a multiplicity of computed tomography (CT)
   examination protocols.
   Methods: A validated Monte Carlo program was employed to model a common
   CT system (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare). The organ and effective doses
   were estimated from 13 commonly used body and neurological CT
   examination. The dose estimation was performed on 58 adult computational
   extended cardiac-torso phantoms (35 male, 23 female, mean age 51.5
   years, mean weight 80.2 kg). The organ dose normalized by CTDIvol (h
   factor) and effective dose normalized by the dose length product (DLP)
   (k factor) were calculated from the results. A mathematical model was
   derived for the correlation between the h and k factors with the patient
   size across the protocols. Based on this mathematical model, a dose
   estimation iPhone operating system application was designed and
   developed to be used as a tool to estimate dose to the patients for a
   variety of routinely used CT examinations.
   Results: The organ dose results across all the protocols showed an
   exponential decrease with patient body size. The correlation was
   generally strong for the organs which were fully or partially located
   inside the scan coverage (Pearson sample correlation coefficient (r) of
   0.49). The correlation was weaker for organs outside the scan coverage
   for which distance between the organ and the irradiation area was a
   stronger predictor of dose to the organ. For body protocols, the
   effective dose before and after normalization by DLP decreased
   exponentially with increasing patient's body diameter (r > 0.85). The
   exponential relationship between effective dose and patient's body
   diameter was significantly weaker for neurological protocols (r < 0.41),
   where the trunk length was a slightly stronger predictor of effective
   dose (0.15 < r < 0.46).
   Conclusions: While the most accurate estimation of a patient dose
   requires specific modeling of the patient anatomy, a first order
   approximation of organ and effective doses from routine CT scan
   protocols can be reasonably estimated using size specific factors.
   Estimation accuracy is generally poor for organ outside the scan range
   and for neurological protocols. The dose calculator designed in this
   study can be used to conveniently estimate and report the dose values
   for a patient across a multiplicity of CT scan protocols. (C) 2014

   strength) for most unimodal and bimodal samples at most frequencies and
   angles of incidence. However, for samples with a bimodal size

Abstract = {{The field of tissue engineering involves design of high-fidelity tissue
   substitutes for predictive experimental assays in vitro and cell-based
   regenerative therapies in vivo. Design of striated muscle tissues, such
   as cardiac and skeletal muscle, has been particularly challenging due to
   a high metabolic demand and complex cellular organization and
   electromechanical function of the native tissues. Successful engineering
   of highly functional striated muscles may thus require creation of
   biomimetic culture conditions involving medium perfusion, electrical and
   mechanical stimulation. When optimized, these external cues are expected
   to synergistically and dynamically activate important intracellular
   signaling pathways leading to accelerated muscle growth and development.
   This review will discuss the use of different types of tissue culture

Abstract = {{A confluence of water and silver-containing products or compounds
   results in unintentional or intentional discharge of silver species
   (including silver nanoparticles {[}AgNPs], free or organic matter-bound
   Ag+, Ag-halides, or soluble Ag-complexes) into visible light-illuminated
   waters. To date, little is known about the transformations of Ag species
   and mechanisms of AgNP formation in light-illuminated waters consisting
   of components such as bacteria, extracellular polymeric substances
   (EPS), natural organic matter (NOM), chloride, and/or nitrate. In this
   work, we demonstrate that in the presence of combinations of water
   components the transformation of ionic Ag to ``new'' AgNPs occurs via
   heterogeneous nucleation followed by (1) light-induced growth mediated
   by surface plasmon resonance activity of AgNPs, and (2) Ostwald ripening
   in the absence of light and chloride anions. Further, oxidative
   dissolution of AgNPs at near-neutral pH (6.8) releases Ag ions, which
   either complex with the components or form ``new'' AgNPs depending on
   solution chemistry. AgNP nucleation and growth on bacterial cells (e.
   g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may cause cell lysis. This study highlights
   that light-illuminated waters comprising common aquatic components are
   highly favorable for the AgNP formation over dissolution under neutral
   pH conditions, in which the presence of chloride accelerates AgNP
   formation and the reducing capacity of EPS/chloride medium may be
   greater than NOM (humics and fulvics). Findings of this study suggest
   that AgNP formation and dissolution may be a continual process and AgNPs
   thus formed may be stabilized by organic matter, which possibly leads to
   persistence of the nanoparticles in sunlit waters.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a method for determining the relative affinity
   of nanoparticles (NPs) for an ensemble of other particles in a complex,
   heterogeneous suspension. We evaluated this method for NPs
   heteroaggregating with suspended solids present in activated sludge. A
   relationship was derived between the heterogeneous affinity coefficient,
   alpha, and measurements over time of the distribution coefficient,
   gamma, of NPs measured in supernatant versus those removed by
   heteroaggregation and subsequent settling. Application of this method,
   which uses a mathematical relationship to determine alpha from
   experimentally measured gamma values, to a series of metal and metal
   oxide NPs heteroaggregated with activated sludge indicated a relative
   affinity in the order of pristine CeO2, TiO2 NPs, and ZnO NPs > Ag(0)
   NPs surface-modified with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) >
   citrate-functionalized CeO2 NP > Ag(0) NPs surface-modified with gum
   arabic. This trend in relative affinity followed the observed trend in
   removal such that higher affinity corresponded to higher removals of
   NPs. Values of alpha were calculated from measured relative affinities
   using average diameter and concentration of the activated sludge
   particles. The value calculated for PVP-stabilized Ag(0) NPs was
   comparable to a value previously reported for the attachment of these
   same NPs to a biofilm. Calculations also yielded size dependence of
   alpha in the case of the two Ag(0) evaluated that may be linked to NP
   dissolution.}},

Abstract = {{Mammography is currently the most widely utilized tool for detection and
   diagnosis of breast cancer. However, in women with dense breast tissue,
   tissue overlap may obscure lesions. Digital breast tomosynthesis can
   reduce tissue overlap. Furthermore, imaging with contrast enhancement
   can provide additional functional information about lesions, such as
   morphology and kinetics, which in turn may improve lesion identification
   and characterization. The performance of these imaging techniques is
   strongly dependent on the structural composition of the breast, which
   varies significantly among patients. Therefore, imaging system and
   imaging technique optimization should take patient variability into
   consideration. Furthermore, optimization of imaging techniques that
   employ contrast agents should include the temporally varying breast
   composition with respect to the contrast agent uptake kinetics. To these
   ends, we have developed a suite of 4-D virtual breast phantoms, which
   are incorporated with the kinetics of contrast agent propagation in
   different tissues and can realistically model normal breast parenchyma
   as well as benign and malignant lesions. This development presents a new
   approach in performing simulation studies using truly anthropomorphic
   models. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed 4-D phantoms, we
   present a simplified example study to compare the performance of 14
   imaging paradigms qualitatively and quantitatively.}},

Abstract = {{Hypoxia and angiogenesis can significantly influence the efficacy of
   cancer therapy and the behavior of surviving tumor cells. There is a
   growing demand for technologies to measure tumor hypoxia and
   angiogenesis temporally in vivo to enable advances in drug development
   and optimization. This paper reports the use of frequency-domain photon
   migration with a side-firing probe to quantify tumor oxygenation and
   hemoglobin concentrations in nude rats bearing human head/neck tumors
   administered with carbogen gas, cycling hypoxic gas or just room air.
   Significant increase (with carbogen gas breathing) or decrease (with
   hypoxic gas breathing) in tumor oxygenation was observed. The trend in
   tumor oxygenation during forced cycling hypoxia (CH) followed that of
   the blood oxygenation measured with a pulse oximeter. Natural CH was
   also observed in rats under room air. The studies demonstrated the
   potential of the technology for longitudinal monitoring of tumor CH
   during tumor growth or in response to therapy.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of U.S. soldiers are diagnosed with traumatic brain
   injury (TBI) subsequent to exposure to blast. In the field, blast injury
   biomechanics are highly complex and multi-phasic. The pathobiology
   caused by exposure to some of these phases in isolation, such as
   penetrating or inertially driven injuries, has been investigated
   extensively. However, it is unclear whether the primary component of
   blast, a shock wave, is capable of causing pathology on its own.
   Previous in vivo studies in the rodent and pig have demonstrated that it
   is difficult to deliver a primary blast (i.e., shock wave only) without
   rapid head accelerations and potentially confounding effects of
   inertially driven TBI. We have previously developed a well-characterized
   shock tube and custom in vitro receiver for exposing organotypic
   hippocampal slice cultures to pure primary blast. In this study,
   isolated primary blast induced minimal hippocampal cell death (on
   average, below 14\% in any region of interest), even for the most severe
   blasts tested (424 kPa peak pressure, 2.3 ms overpressure duration, and
   248 kPa{*}ms impulse). In contrast, measures of neuronal function were
   significantly altered at much lower exposures (336 kPa, 0.84 ms, and
   86.5 kPa{*}ms), indicating that functional changes occur at exposures
   below the threshold for cell death. This is the first study to
   investigate a tolerance for primary blast-induced brain cell death in
   response to a range of blast parameters and demonstrate functional
   deficits at subthreshold exposures for cell death.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the macular morphology of pediatric versus adult
   eyes with epiretinal membrane (ERM) using spectral domain optical
   coherence tomography and identify characteristics associated with
   postoperative visual acuity.
   Methods: This retrospective study analyzed spectral domain optical
   coherence tomography from pediatric subjects and a randomly selected
   cohort of adult subjects with ERM. Morphologic retinal and ERM features
   were graded by two masked spectral domain optical coherence tomography
   readers and compared with a postoperative change in visual acuity.
   Results: Pediatric ERMs (age, 0.3-16.5 years) were more confluently
   attached to the retina than adult ERMs (age, 40-88 years; P = 0.009) and
   had less fibrillary appearance of the inner retina when separation was
   present (P = 0.044). Pediatric ERMs were associated with more vessel
   dragging (P = 0.019) and less external limiting membrane (P = 0.001) and
   inner segment band visibility (P = 0.010), with a trend toward foveal
   sparing by ERM (P = 0.051) and ``taco{''} retinal folds (P = 0.052)
   compared with adult eyes. Visual acuity improvement was associated with
   intact (P = 0.048) and smooth (P = 0.055, trend) inner segment band in
   children and with smooth inner segment band (P = 0.083, trend) and
   visible external limiting membrane (P = 0.098, trend) in adults.
   Conclusion: We identified morphologic differences between pediatric and
   adult ERM on spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Similar to
   adults, photoreceptor integrity with pediatric ERM seems to predict
   better visual acuity changes after surgical ERM removal.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate new sampling strategies for projection tomography,
   enabling one to employ fewer measurements than expected from classical
   sampling theory without significant loss of information. Inspired by
   compressed sensing, our approach is based on the understanding that many
   real objects are compressible in some known representation, implying
   that the number of degrees of freedom defining an object is often much
   smaller than the number of pixels/voxels. We propose a new approach
   based on quasi-random detector subsampling, whereas previous approaches
   only addressed subsampling with respect to source location (view angle).
   The performance of different sampling strategies is considered using
   object-independent figures of merit, and also based on reconstructions
   for specific objects, with synthetic and real data. The proposed
   approach can be implemented using a structured illumination of the
   interrogated object or the detector array by placing a coded
   aperture/mask at the source or detector side, respectively. Advantages
   of the proposed approach include (i) for structured illumination of the
   detector array, it leads to fewer detector pixels and allows one to
   integrate detectors for scattered radiation in the unused space; (ii)
   for structured illumination of the object, it leads to a reduced
   radiation dose for patients in medical scans; (iii) in the latter case,
   the blocking of rays reduces scattered radiation while keeping the same
   energy in the transmitted rays, resulting in a higher signal-to-noise
   ratio than that achieved by lowering exposure times or the energy of the
   source; (iv) compared to view-angle subsampling, it allows one to use
   fewer measurements for the same image quality, or leads to better image
   quality for the same number of measurements. The proposed approach can
   also be combined with view-angle subsampling. (C) 2014 Optical Society

Abstract = {{The random utility based multiregional input-output (RUBMRIO) model is
   used by several integrated land use and transportation models (ILUTMs)
   to forecast commodity flows in a region and for spatial allocation of
   production activities. It makes use of multiregional input-output models
   which are based on random utility theory. In this work, we use optimal
   control techniques to find optimal final demand and transportation costs
   of a RUBMRIO model, that would lead to a desired level of commodity flow
   and production costs.
   At first, the RUBMRIO model is formulated as a discrete time dynamical
   system. It is shown, using Lyapunov argument, that the fixed point of
   the dynamical system is input-to-state stable (ISS). Then, a discrete
   time optimal control problem is formulated with states as commodity
   flows and production costs, and the final demand and transportation
   costs as control inputs. An optimization problem is then solved to
   obtain control inputs that would lead to desired commodity flows and
   production costs.
   Further, the proposed methodology is applied to a numerical example. It
   is shown that the optimal control based method can achieve user
   specified commodity flows and production costs up to an acceptable
   accuracy level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Candida tropicalis, a species closely related to Candida albicans, is an
   emerging fungal pathogen associated with high mortality rates of 40 to
   70\%. Like C. albicans and Candida dubliniensis, C. tropicalis is able
   to form germ tubes, pseudohyphae, and hyphae, but the genes involved in
   hyphal growth machinery and virulence remain unclear in C. tropicalis.
   Recently, echinocandinand azole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates have
   frequently been isolated from various patients around the world, making
   treatment difficult. However, studies of the C. tropicalis genes
   involved in drug tolerance are limited. Here, we investigated the roles
   of calcineurin and its potential target, Crz1, for core stress responses
   and pathogenesis in C. tropicalis. We demonstrate that calcineurin and
   Crz1 are required for hyphal growth, micafungin tolerance, and virulence
   in a murine systemic infection model, while calcineurin but not Crz1 is
   essential for tolerance of azoles, caspofungin, anidulafungin, and cell
   wall-perturbing agents, suggesting that calcineurin has both
   Crz1-dependent and -independent functions in C. tropicalis. In addition,
   we found that calcineurin and Crz1 have opposite roles in controlling
   calcium tolerance. Calcineurin serves as a negative regulator, while
   Crz1 plays a positive role for calcium tolerance in C. tropicalis.}},

Abstract = {{Short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) imaging is a beamforming technique
   that has demonstrated improved imaging performance compared with
   conventional B-mode imaging in previous studies. Thus far, the use of
   1-D arrays has limited coherence measurements and SLSC imaging to a
   single dimension. Here, the SLSC algorithm is extended for use on 2-D
   matrix array transducers and applied in a simulation study examining
   imaging performance as a function of subaperture configuration and of
   incoherent channel noise.
   SLSC images generated with a 2-D array yielded superior
   contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and texture SNR measurements over SLSC
   images made on a corresponding 1-D array and over B-mode imaging. SLSC
   images generated with square subapertures were found to be superior to
   SLSC images generated with subapertures of equal surface area that
   spanned the whole array in one dimension. Subaperture beamforming was
   found to have little effect on SLSC imaging performance for subapertures
   up to 8 x 8 elements in size on a 64 x 64 element transducer.
   Additionally, the use of 8 x 8, 4 x 4, and 2 x 2 element subapertures
   provided 8, 4, and 2 times improvement in channel SNR along with 2640-,
   328-, and 25-fold reduction in computation time, respectively. These
   results indicate that volumetric SLSC imaging is readily applicable to
   existing 2-D arrays that employ subaperture beamforming.}},

Abstract = {{In Part I of the paper, we demonstrated through simulation the potential
   of volumetric short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) imaging to improve
   visualization of hypoechoic targets in three dimensions. Here, we
   demonstrate the application of volumetric SLSC imaging in phantom and in
   vivo experiments using a clinical 3-D ultrasound scanner and matrix
   array. Using a custom single-channel acquisition tool, we collected
   partially beamformed channel data from the fully sampled matrix array at
   high speeds and created matched B-mode and SLSC volumes of a vessel
   phantom and in vivo liver vasculature. 2-D and 3-D images rendered from
   the SLSC volumes display reduced clutter and improved visibility of the
   vessels when compared with their B-mode counterparts. We use
   concurrently acquired color Doppler volumes to confirm the presence of
   the vessels of interest and to define the regions inside the vessels
   used in contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) calculations. SLSC
   volumes show higher CNR values than their matched B-mode volumes, while
   the contrast values appear to be similar between the two imaging

Abstract = {{Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are used to enhance the properties of
   many manufactured products and technologies. Increased use of ENMs will
   inevitably lead to their release into the environment. An important
   route of exposure is through the waste stream, where ENMs will enter
   wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), undergo transformations, and be
   discharged with treated effluent or biosolids. To better understand the
   fate of a common ENM in WWTPs, experiments with laboratory-scale
   activated sludge reactors and pristine and citrate-functionalized CeO2
   nanoparticles (NPs) were conducted. Greater than 90\% of the CeO2
   introduced was observed to associate with biosolids. This association
   was accompanied by reduction of the Ce(IV) NPs to Ce(III). After S weeks
   in the reactor, 44 +/- 4\% reduction was observed for the pristine NPs
   and 31 +/- 3\% for the citrate-functionalized NPs, illustrating surface
   functionality dependence. Thermodynamic arguments suggest that the
   likely Ce(III) phase generated would be Ce2S3. This study indicates that
   the majority of CeO2 NPs (>90\% by mass) entering WWTPs will be
   associated with the solid phase, and a significant portion will be
   present as Ce(III). At maximum, 10\% of the CeO2 will remain in the
   effluent and be discharged as a Ce(IV) phase, governed by cerianite
   (CeO2).}},

Volume = {{152}},

Abstract = {{An extended Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model that includes time
   variations of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is proposed.
   The instantaneous dissipation rate is described by a log-normal
   distribution to account for rare and intense bursts of dissipation
   occurring over short durations. This behaviour of the instantaneous
   dissipation rate is consistent with field measurements inside a pine
   forest and with published dissipation rate measurements in the
   atmospheric surface layer. The extended model is also shown to satisfy
   the well-mixed condition even for the highly inhomogeneous case of
   canopy flow. Application of this model to atmospheric boundary-layer and
   canopy flows reveals two types of motion that cannot be predicted by
   conventional dispersion models: a strong sweeping motion of particles
   towards the ground, and strong intermittent ejections of particles from
   the surface or canopy layer, which allows these particles to escape
   low-velocity regions to a high-velocity zone in the free air above. This
   ejective phenomenon increases the probability of marked fluid particles
   to reach far regions, creating a heavy tail in the mean concentration
   far from the scalar source.}},

Title = {{Toward robust and accurate contact solvers for large deformation
   applications: a remapping/adaptivity framework for mortar-based methods}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the mortar method has proven to be an effective spatial
   discretization strategy for large deformation contact problems,
   particularly when such problems feature deformable-to-deformable
   contact. The mortar approach has been shown to greatly enhance both the
   spatial accuracy and the robustness with which such problems can be
   solved in many circumstances. In this work, we concern ourselves with
   problems that arise in the context of many practical applications, both
   in manufacturing and in other areas. Specifically, it is frequently
   necessary to remesh a problem in the midst of an ongoing incremental
   loading strategy, either because of adaptive mesh refinement being used
   to improve resolution, or excessive mesh distortion which necessitates
   an overall remeshing. This work focuses on a particularly important
   issue associated with contact remeshing; i.e., the remapping of contact
   variables after the remesh so that a simulation can successfully
   continue. We develop and demonstrate our algorithm in the context of a
   mortar-discretized approach to contact. The approach is applicable to
   either two or three dimensional analysis, and is demonstrated by a
   number of three dimensional numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{We present two test-data delivery optimization algorithms for
   system-on-chip (SoC) designs with hundreds of cores, where a
   network-on-chip (NoC) is used as the interconnection fabric. We first
   present an effective algorithm based on a subset-sum formulation to
   solve the test-delivery problem in NOCs with arbitrary topology that use
   dedicated routing. We further propose an algorithm for the important
   class of NOCs with grid topology and XY routing. The proposed algorithm
   is the first to cooptimize the number of access points, access-point
   locations, pin distribution to access points, and assignment of cores to
   access points for optimal test resource utilization of such NOCs.
   Test-time minimization is modeled as an NoC partitioning problem and
   solved with dynamic programming in polynomial time. Both the proposed
   methods yield high-quality results and are scalable to large SOCs with
   many cores. We present results on synthetic grid topology NoC-based SOCs
   constructed using cores from the ITC'02 benchmark, and demonstrate the
   scalability of our approach for two SOCs of the future, one with nearly
   1000 cores and the other with 1600 cores. Test scheduling under power
   constraints is also incorporated in the optimization framework.}},

Abstract = {{The new generation of digital microfluidic biochips is capable of
   implementing complex biochemical laboratory assays (bioprotocols) on a
   tiny device for automatic and reliable analysis of fluid samples.
   Dilution of a sample fluid is one of the basic steps required in almost
   all bioprotocols. The authors design a dilution engine for sample
   preparation that can produce a stream of target droplets with a desired
   concentration factor by reusing the waste droplets. Also, a scheduling
   scheme is presented for mapping the dilution steps into the dilution
   engine. Next, an architecture is proposed to implement the dilution
   engine using only one (1:1) mix-split microfluidic module (mixer). The
   authors consider two schemes: (i) the base approach, where no on-chip
   storage unit (additional electrode) is available, and (ii) when a
   constant number of storage units is provided. Simulation results show
   that the second scheme saves the expensive reactants most efficiently,
   produces a stream of target droplets very fast and is highly suitable
   for supplying the required number of droplets as needed.}},

Abstract = {{Conventionally, quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers eject ions of
   different mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) in a sequential fashion by
   performing a scan of the rf trapping voltage amplitude. Due to the
   inherent sparsity of most mass spectra, the detector measures no signal
   for much of the scan time. By exploiting this sparsity property, we
   propose a new compressive and multiplexed mass analysis approach-multi
   Resonant Frequency Excitation (mRFE) ejection. This new approach divides
   the mass spectrum into several mass subranges and detects all the
   subrange spectra in parallel for increased mass analysis speed.
   Mathematical estimation of standard mass spectrum is demonstrated while
   statistical classification on the parallel measurements remains viable
   because of the sparse nature of the mass spectra. This method can reduce
   mass analysis time by a factor of 3-6 and increase system duty cycle by
   2x. The combination of reduced analysis time and accurate compound
   classification is demonstrated in a commercial quadrupole ion trap (QIT)
   system.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript discusses basic methodological aspects of optical
   microscopy and micromanipulation methods to study membranes and reviews
   methods to generate giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). In particular, we
   focus on the use of fluorescence microscopy and micropipet manipulation
   techniques to study composition-structure-property materials
   relationships of free-standing lipid bilayer membranes. Because their
   size (similar to 5-100 mu m diameter) that is well above the resolution
   limit of regular light microscopes, GUVs are suitable membrane models
   for optical microscopy and micromanipulation experimentation. For
   instance, using different fluorescent reporters, fluorescence microscopy
   allows strategies to study membrane lateral structure/dynamics at the
   level of single vesicles of diverse compositions. The micropipet
   manipulation technique on the other hand, uses Hoffman modulation
   contrast microscopy and allows studies on the mechanical, thermal,
   molecular exchange and adhesive-interactive properties of
   compositionally different membranes under controlled environmental
   conditions. The goal of this review is to (i) provide a historical
   perspective for both techniques; (ii) present and discuss some of their
   most important contributions to our understanding of lipid bilayer
   membranes; and (iii) outline studies that would utilize both techniques
   simultaneously on the same vesicle thus bringing the ability to
   characterize structure and strain responses together with the direct
   application of well-defined stresses to a single membrane or observe the
   effects of adhesive spreading. Knowledge gained by these studies has
   informed several applications of lipid membranes including their use as
   lung surfactants and drug delivery systems for cancer. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A major contaminant of concern for mountaintop removal/valley fill
   (MTR/VF) coal mining is selenium (Se), an essential micronutrient that
   can be toxic to fish. Creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus), green
   sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus), and composite insect samples were collected
   in March-July, 2011-2013 at two sites within the Mud River, West
   Virginia. One site (MR7) receives MTR/VF coal mining effluent, while the
   reference site (LFMR) does not. MR7 water had significantly higher
   concentrations of soluble Se (p < 0.01) and conductivity (p < 0.005)
   compared to LFMR. MR7 whole insects contained significantly higher
   concentrations of Se compared to LFMR insects (p < 0.001). MR7 creek
   chubs had significantly higher Se in fillets, liver, and ovary tissues
   compared to LFMR samples (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.02,
   respectively). MR7 green sunfish fillets contained significantly higher
   Se (p < 0.0001). Histological examination showed LFMR creek chub gills
   contained a typical amount of parasitic infestations; however MR7 gills
   contained minimal to no visible parasites. X-ray absorption
   spectroscopic analyses revealed that MR7 whole insects and creek chub
   tissues primarily contained organic Se and selenite. These two species
   of Mud River fish were shown to specifically accumulate Se differently
   in tissues compartments. Tissue-specific concentrations of Se may be
   useful in determining potential reproductive consequences of Se exposure
   in wild fish populations.}},

Title = {{Importance of heterogeneous aggregation for NP fate in natural and

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{485}},
Pages = {{309-318}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The growing interest in nanoparticles (NP) is inevitably translating
   into an increase of their emissions in the environment. On the other
   hand, the necessary knowledge about the fate and transport of these NPs
   in the environment remains limited. In particular it is critically
   important to understand how the interactions of NPs with the particles
   already present in environmental matrices affect their fate, transport,
   and eventually persistence in the environment.
   In this study we present a computer model that expands upon the existing
   simple homogeneous aggregation models to account for heterogeneous
   aggregation between NPs and the distribution of natural particles
   already present in environmental waters. The model follows the
   concentrations of purely nanoparticle aggregates, purely background
   particles aggregates, and mixed aggregates, as well as the composition
   of mixed aggregates. After analytical evaluation, we ran simulations to
   illustrate the complexity of heterogeneous aggregation and its impact on
   the fate of NPs.
   The model predicts that the impact of NP size on their persistence in
   the environment is accentuated for low affinity between NPs and
   background particles, and for low background particle concentration. (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction: Modular nanotransporters (MNTs) are vehicles designed to
   transport drugs from the cell surface via receptor-mediated endocytosis
   and endosomal escape to nucleus. Hence their conjugation to Auger
   electron emitters, can cause severe cell killing, by nuclear
   localization. Herein we evaluate the use of MNT as a platform for
   targeted radiotherapy with Ga-67.
   Methods: EGF was the targeting ligand on the MNT, and NOTA was selected
   for its radiolabeling with Ga-67. In the radiolabeling study we dealt
   with the precipitation of MNT (pI 5.7) at the labeling pH (4.5-5.5) of
   67Ga. Cellular and nuclei uptake of Ga-67-NOTA-MNT by the A431 cell line
   was determined. Its specific cytotoxicity was compared to that of
   Ga-67-EDTA, Ga-67-NOTA-BSA and Ga-67-NOTA-hEGF, in A431 and U87MGWTT,
   cell lines, by clonogenic assay. Dosimetry studies were also performed.
   Results: 67Ga-NOTA-MNT was produced with 90\% yield and specific
   activity of 25.6 mCi/mg. The in vitro kinetics revealed an increased
   uptake over 24 h. 55\% of the internalized radioactivity was detected in
   the nuclei at 1 h. The cytotoxicity of Ga-67-NOTA-MNT on A431 cell line
   was 17 and 385-fold higher when compared to non-specific Ga-67-NOTA-BSA
   and 67Ga-EDTA. While its cytotoxic potency was 13 and 72-fold higher
   when compared to 67Ga-NOTA-hEGF in the A431 and the U87MGWIT cell lines,
   respectively, validating its nuclear localization. The absorbed dose,
   for 63\% cell killing, was 8 Gy, confirming the high specific index of
   Ga-67.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate the feasibility of using MNT as a
   platform for single cell kill targeted radiotherapy by Auger electron
   emitters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis is mediated in part by inflammatory
   cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), which promote degradation of
   articular cartilage and prevent human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
   chondrogenesis. In this study, we combined gene therapy and functional
   tissue engineering to develop engineered cartilage with immunomodulatory
   properties that allow chondrogenesis in the presence of pathologic
   levels of IL-1 by inducing overexpression of IL-1 receptor antagonist
   (IL-1Ra) in MSCs via scaffold-mediated lentiviral gene delivery. A
   doxycycline-inducible vector was used to transduce MSCs in monolayer or
   within 3D woven PCL scaffolds to enable tunable IL-1Ra production. In
   the presence of IL-1, IL-1Ra-expressing engineered cartilage produced
   cartilage-specific extracellular matrix, while resisting IL-1-induced
   upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and maintaining mechanical
   properties similar to native articular cartilage. The ability of
   functional engineered cartilage to deliver tunable anti-inflammatory
   cytokines to the joint may enhance the long-term success of therapies
   for cartilage injuries or osteoarthritis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cellular reprogramming holds tremendous potential for cell therapy and
   regenerative medicine. Recently, fibroblasts have been directly
   converted into induced neurons (iNs) by overexpression of the neuronal
   transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1L. Hypothesizing that cell
   topography interactions could influence the fibroblast-to-neuron
   reprogramming process, we investigated the effects of various
   topographies on iNs produced by direct reprogramming. Final iN purity
   and conversion efficiency were increased on micrograting substrates.
   Neurite branching was increased on microposts and decreased on
   microgratings, with a simplified dendritic arbor characterized by the
   reduction of MAP2(+) neurites. Neurite outgrowth increased significantly
   on various topographies. DNA microarray analysis detected 20
   differentially expressed genes in iNs reprogrammed on smooth versus
   microgratings, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed the upregulation of
   Vip and downregulation of Thy1 and Bmp5 on microgratings.
   Electrophysiology and calcium imaging verified the functionality of
   these iNs. This study demonstrates the potential of applying
   topographical cues to optimize cellular reprogramming. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of targets with
   complex motions such as fluctuating ships with oceanic waves and high
   maneuvering airplanes, the azimuth echo signals can be modeled as cubic
   phase signals (CPSs). In this letter, a new ISAR imaging algorithm based
   on the keystone time-chirp rate distribution (KTCRD) is proposed for the
   targets with complex motions. Compared with the recently published
   algorithms for the CPSs, the KTCRD can estimate the parameters of
   multicomponent CPSs without searching procedures and can acquire high
   antinoise performance with a relatively low computational load. With the
   estimated motion parameters, high-quality ISAR images can be obtained.
   Several simulation examples on the synthetic model are shown to validate
   the effectiveness of the new algorithm presented in this letter.}},

Abstract = {{We present a two-dimensional, active, millimeter-wave, electronic beam
   scanner, with Doppler capabilities for stand-off imaging. The
   two-dimensional scan is achieved by mapping the millimeter wave spectrum
   to space using a pair of crossed gratings. The active transceiver and
   heterodyne quadrature detection allow the measurement of the relative
   phase between two consecutive measurements and the synthesis of the
   scene's Doppler signature. The frame rate of the imager is currently
   limited by the sweep rate of the vector network analyzer which is used
   to drive the millimeter wave extenders. All of the beam steering
   components are passive and can be designed to operate at any wavelength.
   The system design, characterization and measurements are presented and
   further uses and improvements are suggested. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{The ability to manipulate an ensemble of single particles and cells is a
   key aim of lab-on-a-chip research; however, the control mechanisms must
   be optimized for minimal power consumption to enable future large-scale
   implementation. Recently, we demonstrated a matter transport platform,
   which uses overlaid patterns of magnetic films and metallic current
   lines to control magnetic particles and magnetic-nanoparticle-labeled
   cells; however, we have made no prior attempts to optimize the device
   geometry and power consumption. Here, we provide an optimization
   analysis of particle-switching devices based on stochastic variation in
   the particle's size and magnetic content. These results are immediately
   applicable to the design of robust, multiplexed platforms capable of
   transporting, sorting, and storing single cells in large arrays with low

Abstract = {{Quantum repeaters (QRs) provide a way of enabling long distance quantum
   communication by establishing entangled qubits between remote locations.
   In this Letter, we investigate a new approach to QRs in which quantum
   information can be faithfully transmitted via a noisy channel without
   the use of long distance teleportation, thus eliminating the need to
   establish remote entangled links. Our approach makes use of small
   encoding blocks to fault-tolerantly correct both operational and photon
   loss errors. We describe a way to optimize the resource requirement for
   these QRs with the aim of the generation of a secure key. Numerical
   calculations indicate that the number of quantum memory bits at each
   repeater station required for the generation of one secure key has
   favorable polylogarithmic scaling with the distance across which the
   communication is desired.}},

Abstract = {{``Functional tissue engineering{''} is a subset of the field of tissue
   engineering that was proposed by the United States National Committee on
   Biomechanics over a decade ago in order to place more emphasis on the
   roles of biomechanics and mechanobiology in tissue repair and
   regeneration. Over the past decade, there have been tremendous advances
   in this area, pointing out the critical role that biomechanical factors
   can play in the engineered repair of virtually all tissue and organ
   systems. In this special issue of the Journal of Biomechanics, we
   present a series of articles that address a broad array of the
   fundamental topics of functional tissue engineering, including: (1)
   measurement and modeling of the in vivo biomechanical environment and
   history in native and repair tissues; (2) further understanding of the
   biomechanical properties of native tissues across all geometric scales,
   in the context of repair or regeneration; (3) prioritization of specific
   biomechanical properties as design criteria; (4) development of
   biomaterials, scaffolds, and engineered tissues with prescribed
   biomechanical properties; (5) development of success criteria based on
   appropriate outcome measures; (6) investigation of the effects of
   mechanical factors on tissue repair in vivo; (7) investigation of the
   mechanisms by which physical factors may enhance tissue regeneration in
   vitro; and (8) development and validation of computational models of
   tissue growth and remodeling. These articles represent the tremendous
   expansion of this field in recent years, and emphasize the critical
   roles that biomechanics and mechanobiology play in controlling tissue
   repair and regeneration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The field of tissue engineering continues to expand and mature, and
   several products are now in clinical use, with numerous other
   preclinical and clinical studies underway. However, specific challenges
   still remain in the repair or regeneration of tissues that serve a
   predominantly biomechanical function. Furthermore, it is now clear that
   mechanobiological interactions between cells and scaffolds can
   critically influence cell behavior, even in tissues and organs that do
   not serve an overt biomechanical role. Over the past decade, the field
   of ``functional tissue engineering{''} has grown as a subfield of tissue
   engineering to address the challenges and questions on the role of
   biomechanics and mechanobiology in tissue engineering. Originally posed
   as a set of principles and guidelines for engineering of load-bearing
   tissues, functional tissue engineering has grown to encompass several
   related areas that have proven to have important implications for tissue
   repair and regeneration. These topics include measurement and modeling
   of the in vivo biomechanical environment; quantitative analysis of the
   mechanical properties of native tissues, scaffolds, and repair tissues;
   development of rationale criteria for the design and assessment of
   engineered tissues; investigation of the effects biomechanical factors
   on native and repair tissues, in vivo and in vitro; and development and
   application of computational models of tissue growth and remodeling.
   Here we further expand this paradigm and provide examples of the
   numerous advances in the field over the past decade. Consideration of
   these principles in the design process will hopefully improve the
   safety, efficacy, and overall success of engineered tissue replacements.

Abstract = {{Cancer progression is mediated by complex epigenetic, protein and
   structural influences. Critical among them are the biochemical,
   mechanical and architectural properties of the extracellular matrix
   (ECM). In recognition of the ECM's important role, cancer biologists
   have repurposed matrix mimetic culture systems first widely used by
   tissue engineers as new tools for in vitro study of tumor models. In
   this review we discuss the pathological changes in tumor ECM, the
   limitations of 2D culture on both traditional and polyacrylamide
   hydrogel surfaces in modeling these characteristics and advances in both
   naturally derived and synthetic scaffolds to facilitate more complex and
   controllable 3D cancer cell culture. Studies using naturally derived
   matrix materials like Matrigel and collagen have produced significant
   findings related to tumor morphogenesis and matrix invasion in a 3D
   environment and the mechanotransductive signaling that mediates key
   tumor-matrix interaction. However, lack of precise experimental control
   over important matrix factors in these matrices have increasingly led
   investigators to synthetic and semi-synthetic scaffolds that offer the
   engineering of specific ECM cues and the potential for more advanced
   experimental manipulations. Synthetic scaffolds composed of
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), for example, facilitate highly
   biocompatible 3D culture, modular bioactive features like cell-mediated
   matrix degradation and complete independent control over matrix
   bioactivity and mechanics. Future work in PEG or similar reductionist
   synthetic matrix systems should enable the study of increasingly complex
   and dynamic tumor-ECM relationships in the hopes that accurate modeling
   of these relationships may reveal new cancer therapeutics targeting
   tumor progression and metastasis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Monolithically integrated Helmholtz coils by 3-dimensional printing}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{3D printing technology is of great interest for the monolithic
   fabrication of integrated systems; however, it is a challenge to
   introduce metallic components into 3D printed molds to enable broader
   device functionality. Here, we develop a technique for constructing a
   multi-axial Helmholtz coil by injecting a eutectic liquid metal Gallium
   Indium alloy (EGaIn) into helically shaped orthogonal cavities
   constructed in a 3D printed block. The tri-axial solenoids each carry up
   to 3.6A of electrical current and produce magnetic field up to 70 G.
   Within the central section of the coil, the field variation is less than
   1\% and is in agreement with theory. The flow rates and critical
   pressures required to fill the 3D cavities with liquid metal also agree
   with theoretical predictions and provide scaling trends for filling the
   3D printed parts. These monolithically integrated solenoids may find

Abstract = {{Logarithmic decrement is a well known approach for estimating the
   damping ratio from a time history. This paper uses uncertainty
   proliagation to unveil how uncertainties in different quantities can
   impact damping ratio estimates. More specifically, the trade-off between
   the number of periods N between the first and final peaks and
   measurement noise is addressed. The insights gained from this analysis
   are condensed into a single graphic or guide which provides the ideal
   number of periods N to use for a common range of measurement
   uncertainties and damping ratios. The guide is then applied to
   experimental data derived from image processing to estimate the damping
   ratio. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established and cost-effective
   therapy for treating severe chronic pain. However, despite over 40 years
   of clinical practice and the development of novel electrode designs and
   treatment protocols, increases in clinical success, defined as the
   proportion of patients that experience 50\% or greater self-reported
   pain relief, have stalled. An incomplete knowledge of the neural
   circuits and systems underlying chronic pain and the interaction of SCS
   with these circuits may underlie this plateau in clinical efficacy. This
   review summarizes prior work and identifies gaps in our knowledge
   regarding the neural circuits related to pain and SCS in the dorsal
   horn, supraspinal structures, and the Pain Matrix. In addition, this
   review discusses and critiques current experimental and computational
   models used to investigate and optimize SCS. Further research into the
   interactions between SCS and pain pathways in the nervous system using
   animal and computational models is a fruitful approach to improve this
   promising therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Unregulated changes in protease activity are linked to many diseases
   including cancer. Fast, accurate, and low-cost assays for detection of
   these changes are being explored for early diagnosis and monitoring of
   these diseases ( 1 and can also be used as platforms for the discovery
   of new drugs. We report a new methodology for the simple detection and
   quantification of protease activity in buffer and human serum. The assay
   is based on recombinant diblock polypeptides that undergo temperature-
   or salt-triggered micellization in water. The coronae of the micelles
   are linked to the water-insoluble cores by a peptide substrate that is
   cleaved in the presence of the target protease. Protease cleavage of the
   diblock polypeptide triggers the aggregation of the core-forming
   segment, leading to a change in solution optical density, which can be
   used to detect the presence of, and to quantify the concentration of,
   protease. We used matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) as a model protease
   and found peptide aggregation time to be proportional to enzyme
   concentration over a range from endogenous MMP-1 level in human serum
   (similar to 3 ng/mL) to 100 ng/mL (0.15-5 nM) in 40\% human serum and
   1-100 ng/mL in buffer. The assay does not require any intermediate steps
   or sophisticated data analysis, and the modular design of the assay
   system is amenable to straightforward adaptation for the detection of a
   wide range of proteases.}},

Title = {{Sensor spacing affects the tissue impedance spectra of rabbit
   ventricular epicardium}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{306}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{This study was designed to test the hypothesis that a complex composite
   impedance spectra develops when stimulation and recording of cardiac
   muscle with sufficiently fine spatial resolution in a four-electrode
   configuration is used. With traditional (millimeter scale) separations,
   the ratio between the recorded interstitial central potential difference
   and total supplied interstitial current is constant at all frequencies.
   This occurs because the fraction of supplied current that redistributes
   to the intracellular compartment depends on effective membrane
   resistance between electrodes, which is low, to a much greater extent
   than effective membrane capacitance. The spectra should therefore change
   with finer separations at which effective membrane resistance increases,
   as supplied current will remain primarily interstitial at lower
   frequencies and redistribute between compartments at higher frequencies.
   To test this hypothesis, we built arrays with sensors separated (d) by
   804 mu m, 452 mu m, and 252 mu m; positioned those arrays across myocyte
   axes on rabbit ventricular epicardium; and resolved spectra in terms of
   resistivity (rho(t)) and reactivity (chi(t)) over the 10 Hz to 4,000 Hz
   range. With all separations, we measured comparable spectra with
   predictions from passive membrane simulations that used a
   three-dimensional structural framework in which intracellular,
   interstitial, and membrane properties were prescribed based on the
   limited data available from the literature. At the finest separation, we
   found mean rho(t) at 100 Hz and 4,000 Hz that lowered from 395 Omega-cm
   to 236 Omega-cm, respectively, with maximal mean chi(t) of 160 Omega-cm.
   This experimental confirmation of spectra development in whole heart
   experiments is important because such development is central to achieve
   measurements of intracellular and interstitial passive electrical
   properties in cardiac electrophysiological experiments using only
   interstitial access.}},

Abstract = {{We report a method to generate hierarchical topographical patterns on
   demand under the control of applied voltages. The method is implemented
   by harnessing the electro-creasing instability in multilayer elastomer
   films. The critical electric field for electro-creasing instability in a
   layer of elastomer scales with square root of the elastomer's modulus,
   while the wavelength of instability pattern scales with the layer's
   thickness. By rationally designing elastomer films with varied modulus
   and thickness throughout different layers, we control the formation of
   surface instability patterns with feature sizes of different scales
   under prescribed voltages. The method is very versatile, giving various
   types of hierarchical patterns such as randomly oriented, aligned, and
   gradient ones. A theoretical model is developed and validated to guide
   the design of hierarchical patterns. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Intranasal mRNA nanoparticle vaccination induces prophylactic and
   therapeutic anti-tumor immunity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{Direct in vivo administration of messenger RNA (mRNA) delivered in both
   naked and nanoparticle formats are actively investigated because the use
   of dendritic cells transfected ex vivo with mRNA for cancer therapy is
   expensive and needs significant infrastructure. Notably, intravenous and
   subcutaneous injections are the only routes of administration tested for
   mRNA nanoparticle tumor vaccination. In this report, we demonstrate that
   tumor immunity can be achieved via nasal administration of mRNA. Mice
   nasally immunized with mRNA delivered in nanoparticle format demonstrate
   delayed tumor progression in both prophylactic and therapeutic
   immunization models. The observed tumor immunity correlates with splenic
   antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and is achieved only when mRNA is

Abstract = {{A Bayesian statistical model is developed for analysis of the
   time-evolving properties of infectious disease, with a particular focus
   on viruses. The model employs a latent semi-Markovian state process, and
   the state-transition statistics are driven by three terms: (i) a general
   time-evolving trend of the overall population, (ii) a semi-periodic term
   that accounts for effects caused by the days of the week, and (iii) a
   regression term that relates the probability of infection to covariates
   (here, specifically, to the Google Flu Trends data). Computations are
   performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Results are presented
   using a novel data set: daily self-reported symptom scores from hundreds
   of Duke University undergraduate students, collected over three academic
   years. The illnesses associated with these students are (imperfectly)
   labeled using real-time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for
   several viruses, and gene-expression data were also analyzed. The
   statistical analysis is performed on the daily, self-reported symptom
   scores, and the RT PCR and gene-expression data are employed for

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides are repetitive biopolymers that exhibit a
   lower critical solution temperature phase transition behavior, existing
   as soluble unimers below a characteristic transition temperature and
   aggregating into micron-scale coacervates above their transition
   temperature. The design of elastin-like polypeptides at the genetic
   level permits precise control of their sequence and length, which
   dictates their thermal properties. Elastin-like polypeptides are used in
   a variety of applications including biosensing, tissue engineering, and
   drug delivery, where the transition temperature and biopolymer
   architecture of the ELP can be tuned for the specific application of
   interest. Furthermore, the lower critical solution temperature phase
   transition behavior of elastin-like polypeptides allows their
   purification by their thermal response, such that their selective
   coacervation and resolubilization allows the removal of both soluble and
   insoluble contaminants following expression in Escherichia coli. This
   approach can be used for the purification of elastin-like polypeptides
   alone or as a purification tool for peptide or protein fusions where
   recombinant peptides or proteins genetically appended to elastin-like
   polypeptide tags can be purified without chromatography. This protocol
   describes the purification of elastin-like polypeptides and their
   peptide or protein fusions and discusses basic characterization
   techniques to assess the thermal behavior of pure elastin-like

Abstract = {{Prior studies evaluated the interplay between climate and orography by
   investigating the sensitivity of relief to precipitation using the
   stream power erosion law (SPEL) for specified erosion rates. Here we
   address the inverse problem, inferring realistic spatial distributions
   of erosion rates for present-day topography and contemporaneous climate
   forcing. In the central Andes, similarities in the altitudinal
   distribution and density of first-order stream outlets and precipitation
   suggest a direct link between climate and fluvial erosion. Erosion rates
   are estimated with a Bayesian physical-statistical model based on the
   SPEL applied at spatial scales that capture joint hydrogeomorphic and
   hydrometeorological patterns within five river basins and one
   intermontane basin in Peru and Bolivia. Topographic slope and area data
   were generated from a high-resolution (similar to 90 m) digital
   elevation map, and mean annual precipitation was derived from 14 years
   of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42v.7 product and adjusted with
   rain gauge data. Estimated decadal-scale erosion rates vary between 0.68
   and 11.59 mm/yr, with basin averages of 2.1-8.5 mm/yr. Even accounting
   for uncertainty in precipitation and simplifying assumptions, these
   values are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than most millennial and
   million year timescale estimates in the central Andes, using various
   geological dating techniques (e. g., thermochronology and cosmogenic
   nuclides), but they are consistent with other decadal-scale estimates
   using landslide mapping and sediment flux observations. The results also
   reveal a pattern of spatially dependent erosion consistent with basin
   hypsometry. The modeling framework provides a means of remotely
   estimating erosion rates and associated uncertainties under current
   climate conditions over large regions.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{5170-5183}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Photosynthesis is governed by leaf water status that depends on the
   difference between the rates of transpiration and water supply from the
   soil and through the plant xylem. When transpiration increases compared
   to water supply, the leaf water potential reaches a more negative
   equilibrium, leading to water stress. Both high atmospheric vapor
   pressure deficit and low soil moisture increase the water demand while
   decreasing the supply due to lowered soil-to-root conductance and xylem
   cavitation. Therefore, dry conditions may eventually reduce the leaf
   water potential to the point of collapsing the plant hydraulic system.
   This ``hydraulic failure{''} is shown to correspond to a fold
   bifurcation where the environmental parameters (vapor pressure deficit
   and soil moisture) trigger the loss of a physiologically sustainable
   equilibrium. Using a minimal plant hydraulic model, coordination among
   plant hydraulic traits is shown to result in increased resilience to
   environmental stresses, thereby impeding hydraulic failure unless
   hydraulic traits deteriorate due to prolonged water shortage or other
   damages.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The goal was to assess effects of IOP and pilocarpine-induced
   ciliary muscle contraction on conventional outflow pathway tissues in
   living anesthetized mice.
   METHODS. Intraocular pressure was controlled by intracameral cannulation
   of mouse eyes while imaging using spectral-domain optical coherence
   tomography (SD-OCT). Time-lapse sagittal SD-OCT sections through
   Schlemm's canal (SC) were acquired while changing IOP stepwise between
   10 and 45 mm Hg. After topical application of 1\% pilocarpine, the
   series of IOP steps and imaging were repeated. Effects of pilocarpine on
   IOP and outflow facility in living mice were verified by rebound
   tonometry and flow measurements at three different IOPs, respectively.
   In vivo OCT images were compared with eyes analyzed by standard
   histology.
   RESULTS. In living mice imaged by SD-OCT, the lumen of SC progressively
   collapsed with increasing IOP, reaching near complete closure at 20 mm
   Hg. Schlemm's canal collapse was reversible, with the lumen opening
   within minutes after returning IOP from 45 to 10 mm Hg.
   Pilocarpine-induced ciliary muscle contraction changed SC lumen area by
   131.6\% +/- 21.0\% compared with untreated controls at 10 mm Hg, opened
   the trabecular meshwork, and prevented complete collapse of the SC lumen
   at higher pressures. Similar results were observed by standard
   histology. Pilocarpine increased outflow facility 4-fold (P = 0.02) and
   lowered IOP (16.46 +/- 2.23 vs. 11.08 +/- 2.28 mm Hg, P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS. Spectral-domain OCT was effective at visualizing changes in
   SC lumen in living mice. Results with pilocarpine are consistent with
   the concept that a primary role for the ciliary muscle is to prevent
   collapse of SC.}},

   roles in modern electrified society. Owning to their mechanical
   compliance, soft dielectrics subject to voltages frequently undergo
   large deformation and mechanical instabilities. The deformation and
   instabilities can lead to detrimental failures in some applications of
   soft dielectrics such as polymer capacitors and insulating gels but can
   also be rationally harnessed to enable novel functions such as
   artificial muscle, dynamic surface patterning, and energy harvesting.
   According to mechanical constraints on soft dielectrics, we classify
   their deformation and instabilities into three generic modes: (i)
   thinning and pull-in, (ii) electro-creasing to cratering, and (iii)
   electro-cavitation. We then provide a systematic understanding of
   different modes of deformation and instabilities of soft dielectrics by
   integrating state-of-the-art experimental methods and observations,
   theoretical models, and applications. Based on the understanding, a
   systematic set of strategies to prevent or harness the deformation and
   instabilities of soft dielectrics for diverse applications are
   discussed. The review is concluded with perspectives on future
   directions of research in this rapidly evolving field. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Objective: Pathological gaits have been shown to limit transfer between
   potential (PE) and kinetic (KE) energy during walking, which can
   increase locomotor costs. The purpose of this study was to examine
   whether energy exchange would be limited in people with knee
   osteoarthritis (OA).
   Methods: Ground reaction forces during walking were collected from 93
   subjects with symptomatic knee OA (self-selected and fast speeds) and 13
   healthy controls (self-selected speed) and used to calculate their
   center of mass (COM) movements, PE and KE relationships, and energy
   recovery during a stride. Correlations and linear regressions examined
   the impact of energy fluctuation phase and amplitude, walking velocity,
   body mass, self-reported pain, and radiographic severity on recovery.
   Paired t-tests were run to compare energy recovery between cohorts.
   Results: Symptomatic knee OA subjects displayed lower energetic recovery
   during self-selected walking speeds than healthy controls (P = 0.0018).
   PE and KE phase relationships explained the majority (66\%) of variance
   in recovery. Recovery had a complex relationship with velocity and its
   change across speeds was significantly influenced by the self-selected
   walking speed of each subject. Neither radiographic OA scores nor
   subject self-reported measures demonstrated any relationship with energy
   recovery.
   Conclusions: Knee OA reduces effective exchange of PE and KE,
   potentially increasing the muscular work required to control movements
   of the COM. Gait retraining may return subjects to more normal patterns
   of energy exchange and allow them to reduce fatigue. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Cyberphysical digital microfluidics enable the integration of fluidic
   operations, biochemical reaction-outcome detection, and software-based
   control in a biochip. However, biochemistry synthesis algorithms and
   biochip design methods proposed in the literature are oblivious to
   completion-time uncertainties in fluidic operations, and they do not
   meet the requirements of the cyberphysical integration in digital
   microfluidics. We present an operation-interdependency-aware synthesis
   method that uses frequency scaling and is responsive to uncertainties
   that are inherent in the completion times of fluidic operations such as
   mixing and thermal cycling. Using this design approach, we can carry out
   dynamic online decision-making for the execution of fluidic operations
   and droplet-routing in response to detector feedback. We use three
   common laboratorial protocols to demonstrate that, compared to
   uncertainty-oblivious biochip design, the proposed dynamic
   decision-making approach is more effective in satisfying realistic
   physical constraints. As a result, it decreases the likelihood of
   erroneous reaction outcomes, and it leads to reduced time-to-results,
   less repetition of reaction steps, and less wastage of precious samples
   and reagents.}},

Abstract = {{A new inextensible theory of beam and plate deformation has been

   computational codes for the static and dynamic nonlinear beam and plate
   modal equations have been developed. The computations and experiments
   for static loading and deformation of a beam show that the inextensible
   theory produces results in excellent agreement with experiment. Also, a
   comparison of the inextensible theory for a plate with a static
   experiment is encouraging. Finally, a numerical study of dynamic
   deflection for an inextensible beam and plate has also been made. The
   results show a hysteresis dynamic response that depends on whether the
   excitation frequency is increasing or decreasing for the stiffness
   nonlinearity only or for the inertia nonlinearity only. The inertia
   nonlinear force has a significant effect on the dynamic response in the
   resonant frequency range.}},

Abstract = {{Surfaces modified with thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
   (PNIPAAm) support mild and efficient harvesting of anchorage-dependent
   cells. To enable cellular detachment, however, the surfaces must exhibit
   a narrow range of PNIPAAm thicknesses. In this work, this limitation is
   circumvented by introducing nanopatterns to grafted PNIPAAm brushes,
   eliminating the critical thickness requirement for cell-culturing
   applications. Nanopatterned PNIPAAm surfaces are prepared using a
   combination of interferometric lithography (IL) and surface-initiated
   polymerization. Above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of
   PNIPAAm (approximate to 32 degrees C), these surfaces support the
   attachment and proliferation of mammalian cells (e.g., fibroblasts and
   endothelial cells). Below the LCST of PNIPAAm, cells readily detach from
   the nanopatterned PNIPAAm surfaces without influence from the period of
   nanopatterns, which vary between 157 +/- 9 nm to 1021 +/- 17 nm. Cells
   selectively attach and proliferate on PNIPAAm nanopatterns as compared
   to thick unpatterned PNIPAAm, which is further exploited to spatially
   direct cellular growth to generate cellular micropatterns. Nanopatterned
   PNIPAAm surfaces provide a unique solution to the critical thickness
   issue for cell harvesting and facilitate spatial control of cellular
   growth on surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{There has recently been a significant amount of activity in developing
   supervisory control algorithms for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle
   operation by a single operator. While previous work has demonstrated the
   favorable impacts that arise in the introduction of increasingly
   sophisticated autonomy algorithms, little work has performed an explicit
   comparison of different types of multiple unmanned vehicle control
   architectures on operator performance and workload. This paper compares
   a vehicle-based paradigm (where a single operator individually assigns
   tasks to unmanned assets) to a task-based paradigm (where the operator
   generates a task list, which is then given to the group of vehicles that
   determine how to best divide the tasks among themselves.) The results
   demonstrate significant advantages in using a task-based paradigm for
   both overall performance and robustness to increased workload. This
   effort also demonstrated that while previous video gaming experience
   mattered for performance, the degree of experience that demonstrated
   benefit was minimal. Further work should focus on designing a flexible
   automated system that allows operators to focus on a primary goal, but
   also facilitate lower level control when needed without degradation in
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: Nucleic acids have become powerful building blocks for
   creating supramolecular nanostructures with a variety of new and
   interesting behaviors. The predictable and guided folding of DNA,
   inspired by nature, allows designs to manipulate molecular-scale
   processes unlike any other material system. Thus, DNA can be co-opted
   for engineered and purposeful ends.
   This Account details a small portion of what can be engineered using DNA
   within the context of computer architectures and systems. Over a decade
   of work at the intersection of DNA nanotechnology and computer system
   design has shown several key elements and properties of how to harness
   the massive parallelism created by DNA self-assembly. This work is
   presented, naturally, from the bottom-up beginning with early work on
   strand sequence design for deterministic, finite DNA nanostructure
   synthesis. The key features of DNA nanostructures are explored,
   including how the use of small DNA motifs assembled in a hierarchical
   manner enables full-addressability of the final nanostructure, an
   important property for building dense and complicated systems. A full
   computer system also requires devices that are compatible with DNA
   self-assembly and cooperate at a higher level as circuits patterned over
   many, many replicated units. Described here is some work in this area
   investigating nanowire and nanoparticle devices, as well as
   chromophore-based circuits called resonance energy transfer (RET) logic.
   The former is an example of a new way to bring traditional silicon
   transistor technology to the nanoscale, which is increasingly
   problematic with current fabrication methods. RET logic, on the other
   hand, introduces a framework for optical computing at the molecular
   level.
   This Account also highlights several architectural system studies that
   demonstrate that even with low-level devices that are inferior to their
   silicon counterparts and a substrate that harbors abundant defects,
   self-assembled systems can still outperform conventional systems.
   Further, the domain, that is, the physical environment, in which such
   self-assembled computers can operate transcends the usual limitations of
   silicon machines and opens up new and exciting horizons for their
   application. This Account also includes a look at simulation tools
   developed to streamline the design process at the strand, device,
   circuit, and architectural levels. These tools are essential for
   understanding how to best manipulate the devices into systems that
   explore the fundamentally new computing domains enabled by DNA
   nanotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to control the degree of structural and functional
   anisotropy in 3D engineered cardiac tissues would have high utility for
   both in vitro studies of cardiac muscle physiology and pathology as well
   as potential tissue engineering therapies for myocardial infarction.
   Here, we applied a high aspect ratio soft lithography technique to
   generate network-like tissue patches seeded with neonatal rat
   cardiomyocytes. Fabricating longer elliptical pores within the patch
   networks increased the overall cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix
   alignment within the patch. Improved uniformity of cell and matrix
   alignment yielded an increase in anisotropy of action potential
   propagation and faster longitudinal conduction velocity (LCV). Cardiac
   tissue patches with a higher degree of cardiomyocyte alignment and
   electrical anisotropy also demonstrated greater isometric twitch forces.
   After two weeks of culture, specific measures of electrical and
   contractile function (LCV = 26.8 +/- 0.8 cm s(-1), specific twitch force
   = 8.9 +/- 1.1 mN mm(-2) for the longest pores studied) were comparable
   to those of neonatal rat myocardium. We have thus described methodology
   for engineering of highly functional 3D engineered cardiac tissues with
   controllable degree of anisotropy.}},

Pages = {{1170-1179}},

Abstract = {{In prior work, several authors including the present ones have noted the
   analogy between the fluid oscillations induced by a bluff body in cross
   flow (e.g., the classic von Karman vortex street behind a cylinder) and
   the flow oscillations often called buffet that occur for flow around
   wings and airfoils in transonic flow at sufficiently large angles of
   attack. In the present study, an airfoil in low-speed flow is placed at
   very high angles of attack and buffet and/or a von Karman vortex street
   is indeed found. Of interest is the fact that the required angles of
   attack at these low speeds are well beyond the angle of attack for the
   onset of stall. The dependence of the characteristic Strouhal or reduced
   frequency on angle of attack and flow velocity (Reynolds number) is also
   determined, as are the peak amplitudes of the oscillating flow. At the
   large static angles of attack where buffet occurs, the airfoil is
   oscillated at various frequencies near the buffet frequency and with
   several amplitudes. Lock-in is found for certain combinations of airfoil
   oscillation frequencies and amplitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Although conventional Yagi antenna has the advantage of unidirectional
   radiation patterns, it is not suitable for wideband applications due to
   its drawback of narrow bandwidth. In this communication, a compact
   wideband planar printed quasi-Yagi antenna is presented. The proposed
   quasi-Yagi antenna consists of a microstrip line to slotline transition
   structure, a driver dipole, and a parasitic strip element. The driver
   dipole is connected to the slotline through a coplanar stripline (CPS).
   The proposed antenna uses a stepped connection structure between the CPS
   and the slotline to improve the impedance matching. Two apertures are
   symmetrically etched in the ground plane to improve the unidirectional
   radiation characteristics. Simulation and experimental results show that
   the unidirectional radiation patterns of the proposed antenna are good.
   A 92.2\% measured bandwidth with S-11 < -10 dB from 3.8 to 10.3 GHz is
   achieved. A moderate gain, which is better than 4 dBi, is also obtained.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1423-1438}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers an online (real-time) control problem that involves
   an agent performing a discrete-time random walk over a finite state
   space. The agent's action at each time step is to specify the
   probability distribution for the next state given the current state.
   Following the setup of Todorov, the state-action cost at each time step
   is a sum of a state cost and a control cost given by the
   Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the agent's next-state
   distribution and that determined by some fixed passive dynamics. The
   online aspect of the problem is due to the fact that the state cost
   functions are generated by a dynamic environment, and the agent learns
   the current state cost only after selecting an action. An explicit
   construction of a computationally efficient strategy with small regret
   (i.e., expected difference between its actual total cost and the
   smallest cost attainable using noncausal knowledge of the state costs)
   under mild regularity conditions is presented, along with a
   demonstration of the performance of the proposed strategy on a simulated
   target tracking problem. A number of new results on Markov decision
   processes with KL control cost are also obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To study vascular features detected with spectral domain
   optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in subjects undergoing retinopathy
   of prematurity (ROP) screening.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Participants and Controls: Fifty-seven premature neonates, 10 with plus
   disease in at least 1 eye and 47 without plus disease.
   Methods: Bedside noncontact SD-OCT imaging was performed after obtaining
   parental consent on 97 consecutive infants between January 2009 and
   September 2012. Fifty-seven subjects (31e49 weeks' post-menstrual age)
   who had an SD-OCT scan in at least 1 eye showing the edge of the optic
   nerve and at least 1 major retinal vascular arcade were included. One
   eye per subject was randomly selected for analysis. Two masked graders
   evaluated scans for (1) retinal vessel elevation, (2) scalloped retinal
   layers, (3) hyporeflective vessels, and (4) retinal spaces. To coalesce
   the weight of these features, a Vascular Abnormality Score by OCT (VASO)
   was created. For quantitative assessment of vessel elevation, retinal
   surface maps were created.
   Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of SD-OCT vascular abnormalities, the
   VASO, intergrader agreement, and presence of elevation on surface maps.
   Results: From among 67 SD-OCT characteristics that were recorded, the
   most common characteristics found were vessel elevation (44\%),
   hyporeflective vessels (40\%), scalloped layers (22\%), and retinal
   spaces (11\%). Features significantly associated with plus disease were
   vessel elevation (P = 0.01), hyporeflective vessels (P = 0.04), and
   scalloped retinal layers (P = 0.006). Intragrader agreement was between
   74\% and 90\% for all features. The VASO was significantly higher in
   subjects with plus disease (P = 0.0013). On 3-dimensional SD-OCT
   volumes, eyes with plus disease had greater retinal surface elevation
   that more often matched en face retinal vascular patterns.
   Conclusions: We present a novel 3-dimensional analysis of vascular and
   perivascular abnormalities identified in SD-OCT images of eyes with ROP.
   The SD-OCT characteristics that are more common in eyes with plus
   disease provide the first in vivo demonstration of the effects of
   vascular dilation and tortuosity on perivascular tissue. The VASO and
   surface maps also delineate the severity of vascular pathology in plus
   disease. Further studies evaluating these findings in eyes with pre-plus
   versus normal posterior pole vessels may determine the usefulness of
   SD-OCT in the early detection of vascular abnormalities in ROP. (C) 2014

Title = {{Task-based strategy for optimized contrast enhanced breast imaging:
   Analysis of six imaging techniques for mammography and tomosynthesis}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The use of contrast agents in breast imaging has the capability
   of enhancing nodule detectability and providing physiological
   information. Accordingly, there has been a growing trend toward using
   iodine as a contrast medium in digital mammography (DM) and digital
   breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Widespread use raises concerns about the
   best way to use iodine in DM and DBT, and thus a comparison is necessary
   to evaluate typical iodine-enhanced imaging methods. This study used a
   task-based observer model to determine the optimal imaging approach by
   analyzing six imaging paradigms in terms of their ability to resolve
   iodine at a given dose: unsubtracted mammography and tomosynthesis,
   temporal subtraction mammography and tomosynthesis, and dual energy
   subtraction mammography and tomosynthesis.
   Methods: Imaging performance was characterized using a detectability
   index d', derived from the system task transfer function (TTF), an
   imaging task, iodine signal difference, and the noise power spectrum
   (NPS). The task modeled a 10 mm diameter lesion containing iodine
   concentrations between 2.1 mg/cc and 8.6 mg/cc. TTF was obtained using
   an edge phantom, and the NPS was measured over several exposure levels,
   energies, and target-filter combinations. Using a structured CIRS
   phantom, d' was generated as a function of dose and iodine
   concentration.
   Results: For all iodine concentrations and dose, temporal subtraction
   techniques for mammography and tomosynthesis yielded the highest d',
   while dual energy techniques for both modalities demonstrated the next
   best performance. Unsubtracted imaging resulted in the lowest d' values
   for both modalities, with unsubtracted mammography performing the worst
   out of all six paradigms.
   Conclusions: At any dose, temporal subtraction imaging provides the
   greatest detectability, with temporally subtracted DBT performing the
   highest. The authors attribute the successful performance to excellent
   cancellation of inplane structures and improved signal difference in the
   lesion. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in techniques for recording large-scale brain activity
   contribute to both the elucidation of neurophysiological principles and
   the development of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). Here we describe a
   neurophysiological paradigm for performing tethered and wireless
   large-scale recordings based on movable volumetric three-dimensional
   (3D) multielectrode implants. This approach allowed us to isolate up to
   1,800 neurons (units) per animal and simultaneously record the
   extracellular activity of close to 500 cortical neurons, distributed
   across multiple cortical areas, in freely behaving rhesus monkeys. The
   method is expandable, in principle, to thousands of simultaneously
   recorded channels. It also allows increased recording longevity (5
   consecutive years) and recording of a broad range of behaviors, such as
   social interactions, and BMI paradigms in freely moving primates. We
   propose that wireless large-scale recordings could have a profound
   impact on basic primate neurophysiology research while providing a
   framework for the development and testing of clinically relevant
   neuroprostheses.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we determine the fundamental relation between global
   performance and flow configuration (constructal design) in the case of
   steam power generation with superheater and reheater placed in parallel
   in the same stream of hot gases of combustion. The superheater heats the
   steam for the high pressure turbine, and the reheater supplies steam to
   the low pressure turbine. Both turbines operate irreversibly. We
   consider superheaters and reheaters with balanced counter flows and
   unbalanced counter flows. The total heat transfer area (or the overall
   number of heat transfer units) is finite. We show that the heat transfer
   area can be allocated to the superheater and reheater such that the
   overall power output is maximum. The optimal area allocation ratio is
   reported for two scenarios: designs with and without a maximum allowable
   steam temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To explore the field characteristics and design tradeoffs of
   coils for deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS).
   Methods: We simulated parametrically two dTMS coil designs on a
   spherical head model using the finite element method, and compare them
   with five commercial TMS coils, including two that are FDA approved for
   the treatment of depression (ferromagnetic-core figure-8 and H1 coil).
   Results: Smaller coils have a focality advantage over larger coils;
   however, this advantage diminishes with increasing target depth. Smaller
   coils have the disadvantage of producing stronger field in the
   superficial cortex and requiring more energy. When the coil dimensions
   are large relative to the head size, the electric field decay in depth
   becomes linear, indicating that, at best, the electric field attenuation
   is directly proportional to the depth of the target. Ferromagnetic cores
   improve electrical efficiency for targeting superficial brain areas;
   however magnetic saturation reduces the effectiveness of the core for
   deeper targets, especially for highly focal coils. Distancing winding
   segments from the head, as in the H1 coil, increases the required
   stimulation energy.
   Conclusions: Among standard commercial coils, the double cone coil
   offers high energy efficiency and balance between stimulated volume and
   superficial field strength. Direct TMS of targets at depths of similar
   to 4 cm or more results in superficial stimulation strength that exceeds
   the upper limit in current rTMS safety guidelines. Approaching depths of
   similar to 6 cm is almost certainly unsafe considering the excessive
   superficial stimulation strength and activated brain volume.
   Significance: Coil design limitations and tradeoffs are important for
   rational and safe exploration of dTMS. (C) 2013 International Federation

   limitations to carbon cycling in drying soils}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{69-83}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Soil microbes face highly variable moisture conditions that force them
   to develop adaptations to tolerate or avoid drought. Drought conditions
   also limit the supply of vital substrates by inhibiting diffusion in dry
   conditions. How these biological and physical factors affect carbon (C)
   cycling in soils is addressed here by means of a novel process-based
   model. The model accounts for different microbial response strategies,
   including different modes of osmoregulation, drought avoidance through
   dormancy, and extra-cellular enzyme production. Diffusion limitations
   induced by low moisture levels for both extracellular enzymes and
   solutes are also described and coupled to the biological responses.
   Alternative microbial life-history strategies, each encoded in a set of
   model parameters, are considered and their effects on C cycling assessed
   both in the long term (steady state ahalysis) and in the short term
   (transient analysis during soil drying and rewetting). Drought
   resistance achieved by active osmoregulation requiring large C
   investment is not useful in soils where growth in dry conditions is
   limited by C supply. In contrast, dormancy followed by rapid
   reactivation upon rewetting seems to be a better strategy in such
   conditions. Synthesizing more enzymes may also be advantageous because
   it causes larger accumulation of depolymerized products during dry
   periods that can be used upon rewetting. Based on key model parameters,
   a spectrum of life-history strategies thus emerges, providing a possible
   classification of microbial responses to drought. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extension of the previously published sinh
   transformation and semi-analytical method for the evaluation of nearly
   singular integrals. The extension involves applying the two methods to
   two dimensional (2D) general anisotropic boundary element method (BEM).
   The new feature of the present method is that the distance from the
   calculation point to parabolic elements is expressed as r(2) = (xi -
   eta)(2)g(xi) + b(2) , where g(xi) is a well-behaved function, stand for
   the position of the projection of the nearly singular point and the
   shortest distance from the calculation point to the integration element,
   respectively. As a result, the two methods can be employed in a
   straightforward fashion. The accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed
   methods are demonstrated with four benchmark test integrals that are
   commonly encountered in the application of anisotropic BEM. Comparisons
   between the two proposed methods are also presented in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{The most common mechanical measure of the heart integrates ventricular
   strain between end-diastole and end-systole in order to provide a
   measure of contraction. Here an approach is described for estimating a
   correlate to local passive mechanical properties. Passive strain is
   measured by estimating ventricular strain during atrial systole. During
   atrial systole the atria contract causing passive stretching in the
   ventricles from increased volume. This modification to traditional
   cardiac strain is here termed atrial kick induced strain (AKIS) imaging.
   AKIS imaging was evaluated in a canine ablation model of chronic infarct
   and a canine true chronic infarct model. AKIS images of ablation lesions
   were compared against acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) images and
   tissue blanching, and true chronic infarct AKIS images were compared
   against delayed enhanced-contrast magnetic resonance. AKIS images were
   made with 2-D and 3-D ultrasound data. In both studies, AKIS images and
   the comparison images show good qualitative agreement and good contrast
   and contrast-to-noise ratio. (E-mail: brett.c.byram@vanderbilt.edu) (C)

Abstract = {{Optical nanoscale computing is one promising alternative to the CMOS
   process. In this paper we explore the application of Resonance Energy
   Transfer (RET) logic to common digital circuits. We propose an Optical
   Logic Element (OLE) as a basic unit from which larger systems can be
   built. An OLE is a layered structure that works similar to a lookup
   table but instead uses wavelength division multiplexing for its inputs
   and output. Waveguides provide a convenient mechanism to connect
   multiple OLEs into large circuits. We build a SPICE model from first
   principles for each component to estimate the timing and power behavior
   of the OLE system. We analyze various logic circuits and the simulation
   results show that the components are theoretically correct and that the
   models faithfully reproduce the fundamental phenomena; the power-delay
   product of OLE systems is at least 2.5 x less than the 14 nm CMOS
   technology with 100 x better density. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Rolling isolation systems (RISs) protect mission-critical equipment and
   valuable property from earthquake hazards by decoupling the dynamic
   responses of vibration-sensitive objects from horizontal floor motions.
   These responses involve the constrained rolling of steel balls between
   bowl-shaped surfaces. The light damping of steel balls rolling between
   steel plates can be augmented by adhering thin rubber sheets to the
   plates, thereby increasing the rolling resistance and decreasing the
   displacement demand on the RIS. An assessment of the ability of lightly-
   and heavily-damped RISs to mitigate the hazard of seismically induced
   failures requires high-fidelity models that can adequately capture the
   systems' intrinsic nonlinear behavior. The simplified model presented in
   this paper is applicable to RISs with any potential energy function, is
   amenable to both lightly- and heavily-damped RISs, and is validated
   through the successful prediction of peak responses for a wide range of
   disturbance frequencies and intensities. The validated model can
   therefore be used to compute the spectra of peak floor motions for which
   displacement demands equal capacity. These spectra are compared with
   representative floor motion spectra provided by the American Society of
   Civil Engineers 7-10. The damping provided by rolling between thin
   viscoelastic sheets increases the allowable floor motion intensity by a
   factor of 2-3, depending on the period of motion. Acceleration responses
   of isolation systems with damping supplied in this fashion do not grow
   with increased damping, even for short-period excitations. Copyright (c)

Title = {{The ELPA library: scalable parallel eigenvalue solutions for electronic

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large matrices is a key
   problem in electronic structure theory and many other areas of
   computational science. The computational effort formally scales as
   O(N-3) with the size of the investigated problem, N (e.g. the electron
   count in electronic structure theory), and thus often defines the system
   size limit that practical calculations cannot overcome. In many cases,
   more than just a small fraction of the possible eigenvalue/eigenvector
   pairs is needed, so that iterative solution strategies that focus only
   on a few eigenvalues become ineffective. Likewise, it is not always
   desirable or practical to circumvent the eigenvalue solution entirely.
   We here review some current developments regarding dense eigenvalue
   solvers and then focus on the Eigenvalue soLvers for Petascale
   Applications (ELPA) library, which facilitates the efficient algebraic
   solution of symmetric and Hermitian eigenvalue problems for dense
   matrices that have real-valued and complex-valued matrix entries,
   respectively, on parallel computer platforms. ELPA addresses standard as
   well as generalized eigenvalue problems, relying on the well documented
   matrix layout of the Scalable Linear Algebra PACKage (ScaLAPACK) library
   but replacing all actual parallel solution steps with subroutines of its
   own. For these steps, ELPA significantly outperforms the corresponding
   ScaLAPACK routines and proprietary libraries that implement the
   ScaLAPACK interface (e.g. Intel's MKL). The most time-critical step is
   the reduction of the matrix to tridiagonal form and the corresponding
   backtransformation of the eigenvectors. ELPA offers both a one-step
   tridiagonalization (successive Householder transformations) and a
   two-step transformation that is more efficient especially towards larger
   matrices and larger numbers of CPU cores. ELPA is based on the MPI
   standard, with an early hybrid MPI-OpenMPI implementation available as
   well. Scalability beyond 10 000 CPU cores for problem sizes arising in
   the field of electronic structure theory is demonstrated for current
   highperformance computer architectures such as Cray or Intel/Infiniband.
   For a matrix of dimension 260 000, scalability up to 295 000 CPU cores
   has been shown on BlueGene/P.}},

Title = {{Identification of potential therapeutic targets in a model of
   neuropathic pain}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by damage to the nervous system,
   resulting in dysfunction and aberrant pain. The cellular functions
   (e.g., peripheral neuron spinal cord innervation, neuronal excitability)
   associated with NP often develop over time and are likely associated
   with gene expression changes. Gene expression studies on the cells
   involved in NP (e.g., sensory dorsal root ganglion neurons) are
   publically available; the mining of these studies may enable the
   identification of novel targets and the subsequent development of
   therapies that are essential for improving quality of life for the
   millions of individuals suffering with NP Here we analyzed a publically
   available microarray dataset (GSE30165) in order to identify new RNAs
   (e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms and non-coding RNAs) underlying NP
   GSE30165 profiled gene expression in dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG)
   and in sciatic nerve (SN) after resection, a NP model. Gene ontological
   analysis shows enrichment for sensory and neuronal processes. Protein
   network analysis demonstrates DRG upregulated genes typical to an injury
   and NP response. Of the top changing genes, 34 and 36\% are associated
   with more than one protein coding isoform in the DRG and SN,
   respectively. The majority of genes are receptor and enzymes. We
   identified 15 long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) targeting these genes in
   LNCipedia.org, an online comprehensive IncRNA database. These RNAs
   represent new therapeutic targets for preventing NP development and this
   approach demonstrates the feasibility of data reanalysis for their
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{Significance: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes are indispensable and
   ubiquitous antioxidant defenses maintaining the steady-state levels of
   O-2 center dot(-); no wonder, thus, that their mimics are remarkably
   efficacious in essentially any animal model of oxidative stress injuries
   thus far explored. Recent Advances: Structure-activity relationship
   (half-wave reduction potential {[}E-1/2] versus log k(cat)), originally
   reported for Mn porphyrins (MnPs), is valid for any other class of SOD
   mimics, as it is dominated by the superoxide reduction and oxidation
   potential. The biocompatible E-1/2 of similar to+300 mV versus normal
   hydrogen electrode (NHE) allows powerful SOD mimics as mild oxidants and
   antioxidants (alike O-2 center dot(-)) to readily traffic electrons
   among reactive species and signaling proteins, serving as fine mediators
   of redox-based signaling pathways. Based on similar thermodynamics, both
   SOD enzymes and their mimics undergo similar reactions, however, due to
   vastly different sterics, with different rate constants. Critical
   Issues: Although log k(cat)(O-2 center dot(-)) is a good measure of
   therapeutic potential of SOD mimics, discussions of their in vivo
   mechanisms of actions remain mostly of speculative character. Most
   recently, the therapeutic and mechanistic relevance of oxidation of
   ascorbate and glutathionylation and oxidation of protein thiols by
   MnP-based SOD mimics and subsequent inactivation of nuclear factor kappa
   B has been substantiated in rescuing normal and killing cancer cells.

   Important Mechanical Factors and Proposed Neck Performance Corridors for
   6-and 10-Year-Old ATDs}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Traumatic injuries are the leading cause of death of children
   aged 1-19 in the United States and are principally caused by motor
   vehicle collisions, with the head being the primary region injured. The
   neck, though not commonly injured, governs head kinematics and thus
   influences head injury. Vehicle improvements necessary to reduce these
   injuries are evaluated using anthropomorphic testing devices (ATDs).
   Current pediatric ATD head and neck properties were established by
   scaling adult properties using the size differences between adults and
   children. Due to the limitations of pediatric biomechanical research,
   computational models are the only available methods that combine all
   existing data to produce injury-relevant biofidelity specifications for
   ATDs. The purpose of this study is to provide the first frontal impact
   biofidelity corridors for neck flexion response of 6- and 10-year-olds
   using validated computational models, which are compared to the Hybrid
   III (HIII) ATD neck responses and the Mertz flexion corridors.
   Methods: Our virtual 6- and 10-year-old head and neck multibody models
   incorporate pediatric biomechanical properties obtained from pediatric
   cadaveric and radiological studies, include the effect of passive and
   active musculature, and are validated with data including pediatric
   volunteer 3 g dynamic frontal impact responses. We simulate ATD pendulum
   testsused to calibrate HIII neck bending stiffnessto compare the
   pediatric model and HIII ATD neck bending stiffness and to compare the
   model flexion bending responses with the Mertz scaled neck flexion
   corridors. Additionally, pediatric response corridors for pendulum
   calibration tests and high-speed (15 g) frontal impacts are estimated
   through uncertainty analyses on primary model variables, with response
   corridors calculated from the average SD response over 650 simulations.
   Results and Conclusions: The models are less stiff in dynamic
   anterioposterior bending than the ATDs; the secant stiffness of the 6-
   and 10-year-old models is 53 and 67 percent less than that of the HIII
   ATDs. The ATDs exhibit nonlinear stiffening and the models demonstrate
   nonlinear softening. Consequently, the models do not remain within the
   Mertz scaled flexion bending corridors. The more compliant model necks
   suggest an increased potential for head impact via larger head
   excursions. The pediatric anterioposterior bending corridors developed
   in this study are extensible to any frontal loading condition through
   calculation and sensitivity analysis. The corridors presented in this
   study are the first based on pediatric cadaveric data and provide the
   basis for future, more biofidelic, designs of 6- and 10-year-old ATD
   necks.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue,
   affecting millions of people annually. Anthropomorphic test devices
   (ATDs) and finite element models (FEMs) provide a means of understanding
   factors leading to TBI, potentially reducing the occurrence. Thus, there
   is a need to ensure that these tools accurately model humans. For
   example, the Hybrid III was not based on 3-dimensional human head shape
   data. The objective of this study is to produce average head and skull
   contours for an average U.S. male that can be used for ATDs and FEMs.
   Methods: Computed tomography (CT) scans of adult male heads were
   obtained from a database provided by the University of Virginia Center
   for Applied Biomechanics. An orthographic viewer was used to extract
   head and skull contours from the CT scans. Landmarks were measured
   graphically using HyperMesh (Altair, HyperWorks). To determine the head
   occipital condyle (OC) centroid, surface meshes of the OCs were made and
   the centroid of the surfaces was calculated. The Hybrid III contour was
   obtained using a MicroScribe Digitizer (Solution Technologies, Inc.,
   Oella, MD). Comparisons of the average male and ATD contours were
   performed using 2 methods: (1) the midsagittal and midcoronal ATD
   contours relative to the OC centroid were compared to the corresponding
   1 SD range of the average male contours; (2) the ATD sagittal contour
   was translated relative to the average male sagittal contour to minimize
   the area between the 2 contours.
   Results: Average male head and skull contours were created. Landmark
   measurements were made for the dorsum sellae, nasion skin, nasion bone,
   infraorbital foramen, and external auditory meatus, all relative to the
   OC centroid. The Hybrid III midsagittal contour was outside the 1 SD
   range for 15.2 percent of the average male head contour but only by a
   maximum distance of 1.5mm, whereas the Hybrid III midcoronal head
   contour was outside the 1 SD range for 12.2 percent of the average male
   head contour by a maximum distance of 2mm. Minimization of the area
   between the midsagittal contours resulted in only 2.3mm of translation,
   corroborating the good correlation between the contours established by
   initial comparison.
   Conclusions: Three-dimensional average male head and skull contours were
   created and measurements of landmark locations were made. It was found
   that the 50th percentile male Hybrid III corresponds well to the average
   male head contour and validated its 3D shape. Average adult head and
   skull contours and landmark data are available for public research use
   at http://biomechanics.pratt.duke.edu/data.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated increased susceptibility to breakdown
   of the cerebral vasculature associated with repetitive traumatic brain
   injury. We hypothesized that exposure to two consecutive blast injuries
   would result in exacerbated damage to an in vitro model of the
   blood-brain barrier (BBB) compared with exposure to a single blast of
   the same severity. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, repeated mild or
   moderate primary blast delivered with a 24 or 72 h interval between
   injuries did not significantly exacerbate reductions in transendothelial
   electrical resistance (TEER) across a brain endothelial monolayer
   compared with sister cultures receiving a single exposure of the same
   intensity. Permeability of the barrier to a range of different-sized
   solutes remained unaltered after single and repeated blast, supporting
   that the effects of repeated blast on BBB integrity were not additive.
   Single blast exposure significantly reduced immunostaining of ZO-1 and
   claudin-5 tight junction proteins, but subsequent exposure did not cause
   additional damage to tight junctions. Although repeated blast did not
   further reduce TEER, the second exposure delayed TEER recovery in BBB
   cultures. Similarly, recovery of hydraulic conductivity through the BBB
   was delayed by a second exposure. Extending the interinjury interval to
   72 h, the effects of multiple injuries on the BBB were found to be
   independent given sufficient recovery time between consecutive
   exposures. Careful investigation of the effects of repeated blast on the
   BBB will help identify injury levels and a temporal window of
   vulnerability associated with BBB dysfunction, ultimately leading to
   improved strategies for protecting warfighters against repeated
   blast-induced disruption of the cerebral vasculature.}},

Abstract = {{Mercuric sulfide species are likely the predominant forms of mercury
   (Hg) in anoxic environments where the bioavailability of Hg is a key
   factor for the production of methylmercury (MeHg) by microorganisms.
   Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is known to affect the formation,
   aggregation, and dissolution of HgS particles; however the connection of
   these processes to Hg bioavailability is not well understood. The
   objectives of this study were to gain insights into the molecular
   structure and aggregation properties of nanoscale HgS particles that
   were formed and aged in the presence of DOM and to link this information
   to bioavailability for methylating bacteria. Characterization of
   nanoscale HgS was performed with a series of techniques including
   transmission electron microscopy, photon scattering, X-ray diffraction,
   and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The characterization results
   indicated that the HgS precipitates formed were metacinnabar-like
   spherical nanoparticles that were 3-5 nm in diameter. Over the course of
   the aging process, HgS nanoparticles (nano-HgS) agglomerated to form
   mass-fractal aggregates, although the size of each primary particle
   within the aggregates remained unchanged. Furthermore, the crystallinity
   of nano-HgS increased as the particles aged. The methylation potential
   of nano-HgS by sulfate-reducing bacteria decreased during the aging
   process. No clear correlation was observed between the net productions
   of MeHg and the concentrations of dissolved Hg(II) in the culture media,
   suggesting that the decrease in the methylation potential of aged
   nano-HgS was not simply because of the slower supply of dissolved Hg(II)
   by nano-HgS. While the link between the aging of nano-HgS and decrease
   of methylation potential is not fully understood, the results of our
   study indicate that freshly formed HgS particles in DOM-rich water will
   include a variety of nanoscale structures that have a wide range of
   methylation potentials. This knowledge provides a basis for better
   prediction of mercury bioavailability and MeHg production in
   contaminated environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a printed stepped open-slot antenna with unidirectional
   radiation characteristics is presented. Using a stepped feeding slot and
   a parasitic metal strip, the impedance matching is improved and a wide
   bandwidth is achieved. Additionally, by modifying the ground plane with
   a pair of L-shaped slots, the radiation directivity of the proposed
   antenna is significantly enhanced and good unidirectional radiation
   characteristics are obtained. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   design, a prototype antenna is fabricated and tested. Experimental
   results show that the antenna provides a fractional bandwidth of 101\%,
   ranging from 3.65 to 11.1 GHz with a compact size (30 mm x 30 mm). A
   moderate gain, which is better than 4 dBi, is also obtained. In
   addition, a stable radiation directivity, which is fixed in the endfire
   direction (y-axis direction) is achieved. The measured front-to-back
   ratio is larger than 9.5 dB within the effective bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{Brushite, CaHPO4 center dot 2H(2)O, is a crystalline hydrated acidic
   form of calcium phosphate that occurs in both physiological and
   pathological biomineralization processes. Additionally, it is
   biocompatible in humans. Several groups have investigated the
   experimental Fourier transform infrared vibrational spectrum of
   brushite. These investigations have led to a long-standing debate
   concerning the correct assignment for a few of the observed frequencies,
   particularly, the water stretching and libration modes. Here, we perform
   a comprehensive first principles theoretical investigation of the
   vibrational spectrum of brushite with calculations based on
   dispersion-corrected density functional theory. We obtain both the
   vibrational frequencies, using the frozen phonon approach, and their
   corresponding peak intensities, based on the Born effective charge
   tensor. This allows for an unambiguous assignment of all vibrations,
   including water vibration and libration modes.}},

Title = {{Proteomic Differences between Male and Female Anterior Cruciate Ligament
   and Patellar Tendon}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{The risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and re-injury is
   greater for women than men. Among other factors, compositional
   differences may play a role in this differential risk. Patellar tendon
   (PT) autografts are commonly used during reconstruction. The aim of the
   study was to compare protein expression in male and female ACL and PT.
   We hypothesized that there would be differences in key structural
   components between PT and ACL, and that components of the proteome
   critical for response to mechanical loading and response to injury would
   demonstrate significant differences between male and female.
   Two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a
   label-free quantitative approach was used to identify proteomic
   differences between male and female PT and ACL. ACL contained less type
   I and more type III collagen than PT. There were tissue-specific
   differences in expression of proteoglycans, and ACL was enriched in
   elastin, tenascin C and X, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein,
   thrombospondin 4 and periostin. Between male and female donors, alcohol
   dehydrogenase 1B and complement component 9 were enriched in female
   compared to male. Myocilin was the major protein enriched in males
   compared to females. Important compositional differences between PT and
   ACL were identified, and we identified differences in pathways related
   to extracellular matrix regulation, complement, apoptosis, metabolism of
   advanced glycation end-products and response to mechanical loading
   between males and females. Identification of proteomic differences
   between male and female PT and ACL has identified novel pathways which
   may lead to improved understanding of differential ACL injury and
   re-injury risk between males and females.}},

Title = {{Response of Human Thalamic Neurons to High-Frequency Stimulation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for
   tremor, but the mechanisms of action remain unclear. Previous studies of
   human thalamic neurons to noted transient rebound bursting activity
   followed by prolonged inhibition after cessation of high frequency
   extracellular stimulation, and the present study sought to identify the
   mechanisms underlying this response. Recordings from 13 thalamic neurons
   exhibiting low threshold spike (LTS) bursting to brief periods of
   extracellular stimulation were made during surgeries to implant DBS
   leads in 6 subjects with Parkinson's disease. The response immediately
   after cessation of stimulation included a short epoch of burst activity,
   followed by a prolonged period of silence before a return to LTS
   bursting. A computational model of a population of thalamocortical relay
   neurons and presynaptic axons terminating on the neurons was used to
   identify cellular mechanisms of the observed responses. The model
   included the actions of neuromodulators through inhibition of a
   non-pertussis toxin sensitive K+ current (I-KL), activation of a
   pertussis toxin sensitive K+ current (I-KG), and a shift in the
   activation curve of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current
   (I-h). The model replicated well the measured responses, and the
   prolonged inhibition was associated most strongly with changes in IKG
   while modulation of IKL or Ih had minimal effects on post-stimulus
   inhibition suggesting that neuromodulators released in response to high
   frequency stimulation are responsible for mediating the post-stimulation
   bursting and subsequent long duration silence of thalamic neurons. The
   modeling also indicated that the axons of the model neurons responded
   robustly to suprathreshold stimulation despite the inhibitory effects on
   the soma. The findings suggest that during DBS the axons of
   thalamocortical neurons are activated while the cell bodies are
   inhibited thus blocking the transmission of pathological signals through
   the network and replacing them with high frequency regular firing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a proposal to embed tree-shaped vasculatures in a wall
   designed such that the wall withstands without excessive hot spots and
   peak stresses the intense heating and pressure that impinge on it. The
   vasculature is a quilt of square-shaped panels, each panel having a tree
   vasculature that connects the center with the perimeter. The vascular
   designs for volumetric cooling can be complemented by the shaping and
   distributing of channels for maximum strength and thermal performance at
   the same time. Numerical simulations of heat flow and thermal stresses
   in three directions show that it is possible to determine the optimal
   geometric features of configurations with radial channels and trees with
   radial and one level of bifurcations. The global performance is
   evaluated in terms of the overall thermal resistance and peak von Mises
   stresses. The dendritic design is superior under the studied thermal
   condition. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The use of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in
   consumer-products is rising. Much of these AgNPs are expected to enter
   the wastewater stream, with up to 10\% of that eventually released as
   effluent into aquatic ecosystems with unknown ecological consequences.
   We examined AgNP impacts on aquatic ecosystems by comparing the effects
   of two AgNP sizes (12 and 49 nm) to ionic silver (Ag+; added as AgNO3),
   a historically problematic contaminant with known impacts. Using 19
   wetland mesocosms, we added Ag to the 360 L aquatic compartment to reach
   2.5 mg Ag L-1. Silver treatments and two coating controls were done in
   triplicate, and compared to four replicate controls. All three silver
   treatments were toxic to aquatic plants, leading to a significant
   release of dissolved organic carbon and chloride following exposure.
   Simultaneously, dissolved methane concentrations increased forty-fold
   relative to controls in all three Ag treatments. Despite dramatic
   toxicity differences observed in lab studies for these three forms of
   Ag, our results show surprising convergence in the direction, magnitude,
   and duration of ecosystem-scale impacts for all Ag treatments. Our
   results suggest that all forms of Ag changed solute chemistry driving
   transformations of Ag which then altered Ag impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Pathophysiological activity of basal ganglia neurons accompanies the
   motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. High-frequency (>90 Hz) deep
   brain stimulation (DBS) reduces parkinsonian symptoms, but the
   mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesize that parkinsonism-associated
   electrophysiological changes constitute an increase in neuronal firing
   pattern disorder and a concomitant decrease in information transmission
   through the ventral basal ganglia, and that effective DBS alleviates
   symptoms by decreasing neuronal disorder while simultaneously increasing
   information transfer through the same regions. We tested these
   hypotheses in the freely behaving, 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model
   of hemiparkinsonism. Following the onset of parkinsonism, mean neuronal
   firing rates were unchanged, despite a significant increase in firing
   pattern disorder (i.e., neuronal entropy), in both the globus pallidus
   and substantia nigra pars reticulata. This increase in neuronal entropy
   was reversed by symptom-alleviating DBS. Whereas increases in signal
   entropy are most commonly indicative of similar increases in information
   transmission, directed information through both regions was
   substantially reduced (>70\%) following the onset of parkinsonism.
   Again, this decrease in information transmission was partially reversed
   by DBS. Together, these results suggest that the parkinsonian basal
   ganglia are rife with entropic activity and incapable of functional
   information transmission. Furthermore, they indicate that
   symptom-alleviating DBS works by lowering the entropic noise floor,
   enabling more information-rich signal propagation. In this view, the
   symptoms of parkinsonism may be more a default mode, normally overridden
   by healthy basal ganglia information. When that information is abolished
   by parkinsonian pathophysiology, hypokinetic symptoms emerge.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of a binary source using multiple observers, a variant of the
   so called Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem, is considered. A
   low-complexity Distributed Joint Source Channel Coding (D-JSCC) based on
   the Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Codes (PCCC) is implemented in a
   cluster of sensors in a distributed fashion. Convergence of the
   iterative decoder is analyzed by utilizing EXtrinsic Information
   Transfer (EXIT) chart technique to determine the convergence region in
   terms of the sensors observation accuracy and channel SNR, where the
   iterative decoder outperforms the non-iterative one.
   This leads to design of a bi-modal decoder that adaptively switches
   between the iterative and non-iterative modes in order to avoid
   inefficient iterative information exchange without compromising the
   resulting Bit Error Rate (BER). This adaptive decoding algorithm saves
   the computational power and decoding time by a factor of about 10 by
   avoiding unnecessary iterations.}},

Abstract = {{Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates glioblastoma
   cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion and plays a key
   role in tumor progression. We show that microRNA-7 (miR-7) is a common
   regulator of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/ATK and
   Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, both of which are launched by
   EGFR through its two direct targets, the transcription factors PI3K and
   Raf-1, respectively. Enforced expression of miR-7 markedly decreased
   expression of PI3K, phosphorylated Akt, Raf-1, phosphorylated MEK 1/2,
   and cyclin D1, as well as slightly reduced expression of EGFR. Forced
   expression of PI3K or Raf-1 transcripts lacking the 3'-untranslated
   region (3'-UTR) partially reversed the effects of miR-7 on cell growth
   inhibition and cell cycle arrest in glioma cells. Additionally,
   transient expression of miR-7 in glioblastoma cells strongly inhibited
   in vivo glioblastoma xenograft growth. We conclude that miR-7 is a
   potential tumor suppressor in glioblastoma that acts by targeting
   multiple oncogenes related to the downstream pathway of EGFR and may
   serve as a novel therapeutic target for malignant gliomas.}},

Abstract = {{Regional-scale drought-induced forest mortality events are projected to
   become more frequent under future climates due to changes in rainfall
   patterns. The occurrence of these mortality events is driven by
   exogenous factors such as frequency and severity of drought and
   endogenous factors such as tree water and carbon use strategies. To
   explore the link between these exogenous and endogenous factors
   underlying forest mortality, a stochastic ecohydrological framework that
   accounts for random arrival and length of droughts as well as responses
   of tree water and carbon balance to soil water deficit is proposed. The
   main dynamics of this system are characterized with respect to the
   spectrum of anisohydric-isohydric stomatal control strategies. Using
   results from a controlled drought experiment, a maximum tolerable
   drought length at the point where carbon starvation and hydraulic
   failure occur simultaneously is predicted, supporting the notion of
   coordinated hydraulic function and metabolism. We find qualitative
   agreement between the model predictions and observed regional-scale
   canopy dieback across a precipitation gradient during the 2002-2003
   southwestern United States drought. Both the model and data suggest a
   rapid increase of mortality frequency below a precipitation threshold.
   The model also provides estimates of mortality frequency for given plant
   drought strategies and climate regimes. The proposed ecohydrological
   approach can be expanded to estimate the effect of anticipated climate
   change on drought-induced forest mortality and associated consequences
   for the water and carbon balances.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to manipulate small fluid droplets, colloidal particles and
   single cells with the precision and parallelization of modern-day
   computer hardware has profound applications for biochemical detection,
   gene sequencing, chemical synthesis and highly parallel analysis of
   single cells. Drawing inspiration from general circuit theory and
   magnetic bubble technology, here we demonstrate a class of integrated
   circuits for executing sequential and parallel, timed operations on an
   ensemble of single particles and cells. The integrated circuits are
   constructed from lithographically defined, overlaid patterns of magnetic
   film and current lines. The magnetic patterns passively control
   particles similar to electrical conductors, diodes and capacitors. The
   current lines actively switch particles between different tracks similar
   to gated electrical transistors. When combined into arrays and driven by
   a rotating magnetic field clock, these integrated circuits have general
   multiplexing properties and enable the precise control of magnetizable
   objects.}},

Abstract = {{Native tissues are endowed with a highly organized nanofibrous
   extracellular matrix (ECM) that directs cellular distribution and
   function. The objective of this study is to create a purely natural,
   uniform, and highly aligned nanofibrous ECM scaffold for potential
   tissue engineering applications. Synthetic nanogratings (130 nm in
   depth) are used to direct the growth of human dermal fibroblasts for up
   to 8 weeks, resulting in a uniform 70 m-thick fibroblast cell sheet with
   highly aligned cells and ECM nanofibers. A natural ECM scaffold with
   uniformly aligned nanofibers of 78 +/- 9 nm in diameter is generated
   after removing the cellular components from the fibroblast sheet. The
   elastic modulus of the scaffold is well maintained after the
   decellularization process because of the preservation of elastin fibers.
   Reseeding human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) shows the excellent
   capacity of the scaffold in directing and supporting cell alignment and
   proliferation along the underlying fibers. The scaffold's
   biocompatibility is further examined by an in vitro inflammation assay
   with seeded macrophages. The aligned ECM scaffold induces a
   significantly lower immune response compared to its unaligned
   counterpart, as detected by the pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted from
   macrophages. The aligned nanofibrous ECM scaffold holds great potential
   in engineering organized tissues.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the motion of the plasma critical layer by two different
   processes in the relativistic-electron laser-plasma interaction regime
   (a(0) > 1). The differences are highlighted when the critical layer ions
   are stationary in contrast to when they move with it. Controlling the
   speed of the plasma critical layer in this regime is essential for
   creating low-beta traveling acceleration structures of sufficient
   laser-excited potential for laser ion accelerators. In Relativistically
   Induced Transparency Acceleration (RITA) scheme, the heavy plasma-ions
   are fixed and only trace-density light-ions are accelerated. The
   relativistic critical layer and the acceleration structure move
   longitudinally forward by laser inducing transparency through apparent
   relativistic increase in electron mass. In the Radiation Pressure
   Acceleration (RPA) scheme, the whole plasma is longitudinally pushed
   forward under the action of the laser radiation pressure, possible only
   when plasma ions co-propagate with the laser front. In RPA, the
   acceleration structure velocity critically depends upon plasma-ion mass
   in addition to the laser intensity and plasma density. In RITA, mass of
   the heavy immobile plasma-ions does not affect the speed of the critical
   layer. Inertia of the bared immobile ions in RITA excites the charge
   separation potential, whereas RPA is not possible when ions are
   stationary. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Regions of cardiac tissue that have a combination of focal activity and
   poor, heterogeneous gap junction coupling are often considered to be
   arrhythmogenic; however, the relationship between the properties of the
   cardiac microstructure and patterns of abnormal propagation is not well
   understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
   microstructure on the initiation of reentry from focal stimulation
   inside a poorly coupled region embedded in more well-coupled tissue.
   Two-dimensional discrete computer models of ventricular monolayers (1 x
   1 cm) were randomly generated to represent heterogeneity in the cardiac
   microstructure. A small, central poorly coupled patch (0.40 x 0.40 cm)
   was introduced to represent the site of focal activity. Simulated
   unipolar electrogram recordings were computed at various points in the
   tissue. As the gap conductance of the patch decreased, conduction slowed
   and became increasingly complex, marked by fractionated electrograms
   with reduced amplitude. Near the limit of conduction block, isolated
   breakthrough sites occurred at single cells along the patch boundary and
   were marked by long cell-to-cell delays and negative deflections on
   electrogram recordings. The strongest determinant of the site of
   wave-front breakthrough was the connectivity of the brick wall
   architecture, which enabled current flow through small regions of
   overlapping cells to drive propagation into the well-coupled zone. In
   conclusion, breakthroughs at the size scale of a single cell can occur
   at the boundary of source-load mismatch allowing focal activations from
   slow conducting regions to produce reentry. These breakthrough regions,
   identifiable by distinct asymmetric, reduced amplitude electrograms, are
   sensitive to tissue architecture and may be targets for ablation.}},

Abstract = {{Double-dipole antennas driven by anti-phase signals (W8JK array) are
   often used to achieve broadband and good unidirectional radiation
   patterns. The two dipole elements need a pair of anti-phase signals
   equal in magnitude. However, realization of anti-phase signals with
   equal magnitude for the W8JK array is difficult in a planar structure.
   In this communication, an equivalent feed mechanism of W8JK array is
   presented. An in-phase power divider is used to realize an anti-phase
   feeding network for feeding the W8JK array. In order to demonstrate the

Abstract = {{Students in college courses struggle to understand many concepts
   fundamental to transmission and evolutionary genetics, including
   multilocus inheritance, recombination, Hardy-Weinberg, and genetic
   drift. These students consistently ask for more demonstrations and more
   practice problems. With this demand in mind, the Genetics and Evolution
   app was designed to help students (and their instructors) by providing a
   suite of tools granting them the ability to: (1) simulate genetic
   crosses with varying numbers of genes and patterns of inheritance, (2)
   simulate allele frequency changes under natural selection and/ or
   genetic drift, (3) quiz themselves to reinforce terminology
   (customizable by any instructor for their whole classroom), {*}4) solve
   various problems (recombination fractions, Hardy-Weinberg, heritability,
   population growth), and (5) generate literally an infinite number of
   practice problems in all of these areas to try on their own. Although
   some of these functions are available elsewhere, the alternatives do not
   have the ability to instantly generate new practice problems or achieve
   these diverse functions in devices that students carry in their pockets

Abstract = {{The delivery of biomolecules, including siRNAs (approximate to 21 bp)
   and large plasmids (approximate to 10 kbp), into living cells holds a
   great promise for therapeutic and research applications. Lipoplex
   nanoparticles are popular nanocarriers for gene delivery. In
   conventional transfection methods, the cellular uptake of lipoplex
   nanoparticels occurs through the endocytosis process. The entrapment of
   lipoplex nanoparticles into endocytic vesicle is a major barrier in
   achieving efficient gene silencing and expression. Here, a novel
   nanochannel electroporation (NEP) method is employed to facilitate the
   cellular uptake and release of siRNAs/DNAs from lipoplexes. First, it is
   demonstrated that in a NEP device, lipoplex nanoparticles can be
   injected directly into the cell cytoplasm within several seconds.
   Specifically,it isfound that lipoplexes containing MCL-1 siRNA delivered
   by NEP can more efficiently down-regulate the expression of MCL-1 mRNA
   in A549 cancer cells than conventional transfection. Quantum
   dot-mediated Forster resonance energy transfer (QD-FRET) reveals that
   lipoplexes delivered via NEP can directly release siRNA in the cytoplasm
   without going through the endocytosis route, which unravels the
   responsible mechanism for efficient gene delivery. Furthermore, the
   advantage of combining NEP with lipoplex nanoparticles by the successful
   delivery of large plasmids (pCAG2LMKOSimO, 13 kbp) into CHO cells is
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Developing techniques for multiplex detection of disease biomarkers is
   important for clinical diagnosis. In this work, we have demonstrated for
   the first time the feasibility of multiplex detection of genetic disease
   biomarkers using the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based
   molecular sentinel-on-chip (MSC) diagnostic technology. The molecular
   sentinel (MS) sensing mechanism is based upon the decrease of SERS
   intensity when Raman labels tagged at 3'-ends of MS nanoprobes are
   physically displaced from the nanowave chip's surface upon DNA
   hybridization. The use of bimetallic layer (silver and gold) for the
   nanowave fabrication was investigated. SERS measurements were performed
   immediately following a single hybridization reaction between the target
   single-stranded DNA sequences and the complementary MS nanoprobes
   immobilized on the nanowave chip without requiring target labeling
   (i.e., label-free), secondary hybridization, or post-hybridization
   washing, thus shortening the assay time and reducing cost. Two nucleic
   acid transcripts, interferon alpha-inducible protein 27 and
   interferon-induced protein 44-like, are used as model systems for the
   multiplex detection concept demonstration. These two genes are well
   known for their critical role in host immune response to viral infection
   and can be used as molecular signature for viral infection diagnosis.
   The results indicate the potential of the MSC technology for nucleic
   acid biomarker multiplex detection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two simple SPICE circuit models of the memristor
   using two different kinds of integrators. These models expand and
   simplify the previous methods of solving the memristor's modeling
   equations presented by Hewlett-Packard Lab. The behaviors of the two
   memristor models are investigated when they are excited by a sinusoidal
   voltage source. Both models satisfy the general features of memristive
   systems such as having a zero-crossing property in the form of an i-v
   Lissajous figure. In order to explore the unique characteristics and
   applications of the memristor in microwave devices, first we incorporate
   the memristor in a microstrip transmission line as a load. We do the
   analysis using a finite-difference time-domain simulator integrated with
   a nonlinear SPICE circuit solver. Furthermore, we design a
   reconfigurable microstrip bandpass filter based on a memristor-loaded
   resonator, and utilize a memristor as a carrier-wave modulator
   connecting the microstrip patch antenna to the ground.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the first example of targeting a solid tumor
   that is externally heated to 42 degrees C by ``heat seeking{''}
   drug-loaded polypeptide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles consist of a
   thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) conjugated to
   multiple copies of a hydrophobic cancer drug. To rationally design
   drug-loaded nanoparticles that exhibit thermal responsiveness in the
   narrow temperature range between 37 and 42 degrees C, an analytical
   model was developed that relates ELP composition and chain length to the
   nanoparticle phase transition temperature. Suitable candidates were
   designed based on the predictions of the model and tested in vivo by
   intravital confocal fluorescence microscopy of solid tumors, which
   revealed that the nanoparticles aggregate in the vasculature of tumors
   heated to 42 degrees C and that the aggregation is reversible as the
   temperature reverts to 37 degrees C. Biodistribution studies showed that
   the most effective strategy to target the nanoparticles to tumors is to
   thermally cycle the tumors between 37 and 42 degrees C. These
   nanoparticles set the stage for the targeted delivery of a range of
   cancer chemotherapeutics by externally applied mild hyperthermia of
   solid tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Here, I show that ``entransy{''} has no meaning in physics, because, at
   bottom, it rests on the false claim that in order to transfer heat to a
   solid body of thermodynamic temperature T, the heat transfer must be
   proportional to T. Entransy ``dissipation{''} is a number proportional
   to well known measures of irreversibility such as entropy generation and
   lost exergy (destroyed available work). Furthermore, the ``principle of
   entransy dissipation minimization{''} adds nothing to existing work

   systems reflect the need for both wide-field-of-view situational
   awareness as well as high-resolution imaging for target identification.
   In this work we present a new imaging system architecture designed to
   perform both functions simultaneously and the AWARE 10 camera as an
   example at visible wavelengths. We first describe the basic system
   architecture and user interface followed by a laboratory
   characterization of the system optical performance. We then describe a
   field experiment in which the camera was used to identify several
   maritime targets at varying range. The experimental results indicate
   that users of the system are able to correctly identify similar to 10 m
   targets at between 4 and 6 km with 70\% accuracy. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{Enzyme or gene replacement therapy with acid -glucosidase (GAA) has
   achieved only partial efficacy in Pompe disease. We evaluated the effect
   of adjunctive clenbuterol treatment on cation-independent
   mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR)-mediated uptake and intracellular
   trafficking of GAA during muscle-specific GAA expression with an
   adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector in GAA-knockout (KO) mice.
   Clenbuterol, which increases expression of CI-MPR in muscle, was
   administered with the AAV vector. This combination therapy increased
   latency during rotarod and wirehang testing at 12 wk, in comparison with
   vector alone. The mean urinary glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc4), a urinary
   biomarker, was lower in GAA-KO mice following combination therapy,
   compared with vector alone. Similarly, glycogen content was lower in
   cardiac and skeletal muscle following 12 wk of combination therapy in
   heart, quadriceps, diaphragm, and soleus, compared with vector alone.
   These data suggested that clenbuterol treatment enhanced trafficking of
   GAA to lysosomes, given that GAA was expressed within myofibers. The
   integral role of CI-MPR was demonstrated by the lack of effectiveness
   from clenbuterol in GAA-KO mice that lacked CI-MPR in muscle, where it
   failed to reverse the high glycogen content of the heart and diaphragm
   or impaired wirehang performance. However, the glycogen content of
   skeletal muscle was reduced by the addition of clenbuterol in the
   absence of CI-MPR, as was lysosomal vacuolation, which correlated with
   increased AKT signaling. In summary, (2)-agonist treatment enhanced
   CI-MPR-mediated uptake and trafficking of GAA in mice with Pompe
   disease, and a similarly enhanced benefit might be expected in other
   lysosomal storage disorders.Farah, B. L., Madden, L., Li, S., Nance, S.,

Abstract = {{A generalization of Bregman divergence is developed and utilized to
   unify vector Poisson and Gaussian channel models, from the perspective
   of the gradient of mutual information. The gradient is with respect to
   the measurement matrix in a compressive-sensing setting, and mutual
   information is considered for signal recovery and classification.
   Existing gradient-of-mutual-information results for scalar Poisson
   models are recovered as special cases, as are known results for the
   vector Gaussian model. The Bregman-divergence generalization yields a
   Bregman matrix, and this matrix induces numerous matrix-valued metrics.
   The metrics associated with the Bregman matrix are detailed, as are its
   other properties. The Bregman matrix is also utilized to connect the
   relative entropy and mismatched minimum mean squared error. Two
   applications are considered: 1) compressive sensing with a Poisson
   measurement model and 2) compressive topic modeling for analysis of a
   document corpora (word-count data). In both of these settings, we use
   the developed theory to optimize the compressive measurement matrix, for
   signal recovery and classification.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed storage systems employ codes to provide resilience to
   failure of multiple storage disks. In particular, an (n, k) maximum
   distance separable (MDS) code stores k symbols in n disks such that the
   overall system is tolerant to a failure of up to n - k disks. However,
   access to at least k disks is still required to repair a single erasure.
   To reduce repair bandwidth, array codes are used where the stored
   symbols or packets are vectors of length l. The MDS array codes have the
   potential to repair a single erasure using a fraction 1/(n - k) of data
   stored in the remaining disks. We introduce new methods of analysis,
   which capitalize on the translation of the storage system problem into a
   geometric problem on a set of operators and subspaces. In particular, we
   ask the following question: for a given (n, k), what is the minimum
   vector-length or subpacketization factor l required to achieve this
   optimal fraction? For exact recovery of systematic disks in an MDS code
   of low redundancy, i.e., k/n > 1/2, the best known explicit codes have a
   subpacketization factor l, which is exponential in k. It has been
   conjectured that for a fixed number of parity nodes, it is in fact
   necessary for l to be exponential in k. In this paper, we provide a new
   log-squared converse bound on k for a given l, and prove that k <= 2
   log(2) l (log(delta) l + 1), for an arbitrary number of parity nodes r =
   n - k, where delta = r/(r - 1).}},

   single-degree-of-freedom pitch airfoil system, as well as those of a
   two-degree-of-freedom pitch-and-heave system, in buffeting flows. The
   buffeting flow exhibits shock-wave oscillations of a unique frequency
   that occurs for some combinations of mean flow angle of attack and
   transonic Mach numbers. It was found that frequency lock-in may occur,
   when the frequency of the elastic system is close to the buffet
   frequency, and the amplitude of the elastic oscillation is above some
   threshold. Following frequency lock-in, the system response rapidly
   increases until reaching a limit-cycle oscillation. Synchronization of
   the transonic aerodynamic buffet phenomenon and the structural elastic
   modes provides a physical mechanism that leads to a limit-cycle
   oscillation, as observed in the current computational study.}},

Abstract = {{Women's initial understandings and anticipated acceptability of
   long-acting vaginal gels as potential anti-HIV microbicides was
   investigated by exploring the perceptibility variables associated with
   prototype formulations. Four focus groups with 29 women, aged 18-45,
   were conducted to consider gel prototypes with varied physicochemical
   and rheological properties. Participants responded favorably to the
   concept of long-acting vaginal gels as microbicides. Distinctions in
   understandings and stated needs regarding product dosing,
   characteristics, and effectiveness offer valuable insights into product
   design. Long-acting vaginal gels capable of protecting against HIV/STIs
   will be a viable option among potential users, with dosing frequency
   being an important factor in willingness to use.}},

Abstract = {{This paper determines to within a single measurement the minimum number
   of measurements required to successfully reconstruct a signal drawn from
   a Gaussian mixture model in the low-noise regime. The method is to
   develop upper and lower bounds that are a function of the maximum
   dimension of the linear subspaces spanned by the Gaussian mixture
   components. The method not only reveals the existence or absence of a
   minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) error floor (phase transition) but
   also provides insight into the MMSE decay via multivariate
   generalizations of the MMSE dimension and the MMSE power offset, which
   are a function of the interaction between the geometrical properties of
   the kernel and the Gaussian mixture. These results apply not only to
   standard linear random Gaussian measurements but also to linear kernels
   that minimize the MMSE. It is shown that optimal kernels do not change
   the number of measurements associated with theMMSE phase transition,
   rather they affect the sensed power required to achieve a target MMSE in
   the low-noise regime. Overall, our bounds are tighter and sharper than
   standard bounds on the minimum number of measurements needed to recover
   sparse signals associated with a union of subspaces model, as they are
   not asymptotic in the signal dimension or signal sparsity.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of the vertical structure of rainfall, surface rain rates,
   and drop size distributions (DSDs) in the southern Appalachians were
   analyzed with a focus on the diurnal cycle of rainfall. In the inner
   mountain region, a 5-yr high-elevation rain gauge dataset shows that
   light rainfall, described here as rainfall intensity less than 3 mm
   h(-1) over a time scale of 5 min, accounts for 30\%-50\% of annual
   accumulations. The data also reveal warm-season events characterized by
   heavy surface rainfall in valleys and along ridgelines inconsistent with
   radar observations of the vertical structure of precipitation. Next, a
   stochastic column model of advection-coalescence-breakup of warm rain
   DSDs was used to investigate three illustrative events. The integrated
   analysis of observations and model simulations suggests that
   seeder-feeder interactions (i.e., Bergeron processes) between incoming
   rainfall systems and local fog and/or low-level clouds with very high
   number concentrations of small drops (<0.2 mm) govern surface rainfall
   intensity through driving significant increases in coalescence rates and
   efficiency. Specifically, the model shows how accelerated growth of
   small- and moderate-size raindrops (<2 mm) via Bergeron processes can
   enhance surface rainfall rates by one order of magnitude for durations
   up to 1 h as in the observations. An examination of the fingerprints of
   seeder-feeder processes on DSD statistics conducted by tracking the
   temporal evolution of mass spectrum parameters points to the critical
   need for improved characterization of hydrometeor microstructure
   evolution, from mist formation to fog and from drizzle development to
   rainfall.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{80-92}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Rolling isolation systems (RISs) protect fragile building contents from
   earthquake hazards by decoupling horizontal floor motions from the
   horizontal responses of the isolated object. The RISs in use today have
   displacement capacities of about 20 cm. This displacement capacity can
   be increased by stacking two systems. This paper presents and evaluates
   a complete non-linear model of the coupled dynamics of double RISs. The
   model is derived through the fundamental form of Lagrange's equation and
   involves the non-holonomic constraints of spheres rolling between
   non-parallel surfaces. The derivation requires the use of two
   translating and rotating reference frames. The proposed model is
   validated through comparisons between experimentally measured and
   numerically predicted time histories and peak response quantities total
   acceleration and relative displacement. The effects of the initial
   conditions, the mass of the isolated object, and the amplitude and
   period of the disturbance on the system's performance are assessed. (C)

Abstract = {{For over 20years there has been immense biological insight gained using
   single molecule mechanical measurements to understand properties of
   biomolecules. This review outlines the field of single molecule
   mechanics studies and focuses on the manipulation of proteins, DNA, and
   sugars by single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) by atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). The methods and examples of SMFS by AFM are
   illustrated using recent advances in protein science including titin
   elasticity, mechanical unfolding and refolding of -helical repeat
   proteins, mechanoenzymatics of thioredoxin and titin kinase, and
   intermolecular interactions of P-selectin complexes. The possibilities
   of SMFS to investigate the mechanics of other biopolymers like double-
   and single-stranded DNA and forced-induced conformational changes in
   sugars are also discussed. Finally, SMFS and its application to
   biological processes, like DNA replication, packing and transcription,
   and DNA methylation are illustrated. These measurements provide a unique
   and integral part of the development of our knowledge of biochemistry
   and molecular mechanics. For further resources related to this article,

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Subject to a compressive membrane stress, an elastic film bonded on a
   substrate can become unstable, forming wrinkles, creases or delaminated
   buckles. Further increasing the compressive stress can induce advanced
   modes of instabilities including period-doubles, folds, localized
   ridges, delamination, and coexistent instabilities. While various
   instabilities in film-substrate systems under compression have been
   analyzed separately, a systematic and quantitative understanding of
   these instabilities is still elusive. Here we present a joint
   experimental and theoretical study to systematically explore the
   instabilities in elastic film-substrate systems under uniaxial
   compression. We use the Maxwell stability criterion to analyze the
   occurrence and evolution of instabilities analogous to phase transitions
   in thermodynamic systems. We show that the moduli of the film and the
   substrate, the film-substrate adhesion strength, the film thickness, and
   the prestretch in the substrate determine various modes of
   instabilities. Defects in the film-substrate system can facilitate it to
   overcome energy barriers during occurrence and evolution of
   instabilities. We provide a set of phase diagrams to predict both
   initial and advanced modes of instabilities in compressed film-substrate
   systems. The phase diagrams can be used to guide the design of
   film-substrate systems to achieve desired modes of instabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminants of emerging concern were measured in mussels collected
   along the California coast in 2009-2010. The seven classes were
   alkylphenols, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDE), other flame retardants, current use pesticides,
   perfluorinated compounds (PFC), and single walled carbon nanotubes. At
   least one contaminant was detected at 67 of the 68 stations (98\%), and
   67 of the 167 analytes had at least one detect (40\%). Alkylphenol,
   PBDE, and PFC concentrations increased with urbanization and proximity
   to storm water discharge; pesticides had higher concentrations at
   agricultural stations. These results suggest that certain compounds; for
   example, alkyiphenols, lomefloxacin and PBDE, are appropriate for
   inclusion in future coastal bivalve monitoring efforts based on maximum
   concentrations >50 ng/g dry weight and detection frequencies >50\%.
   Other compounds, for example PFC and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), may
   also be suggested for inclusion due to their >25\% detection frequency
   and potential for biomagnification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{333}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2617-2631}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to determine by a singular perturbation
   approach the dynamic response of a harmonically forced system
   experiencing a pitchfork bifurcation. The model of an extensible beam
   forced by a harmonic excitation and subject to an axial static buckling
   is space-discretized by a Galerkin approach and studied by the Normal
   Form Method for different values of equation parameters influencing the
   nonlinear dynamic behavior like damping coefficient, load amplitude and
   frequency. A relevant issue in the perturbation methods is the concept
   of small and zero divisors which are related to the possibility to build
   a transformation that simplifies the original studied problem, i.e. to
   obtain the Normal Form, by eliminating as much as possible
   nonlinearities in the equations. For nonconservative systems, like
   structural damped systems, there are no conditions in the prior
   literature that define what ``small{''} means relatively to a divisor.
   In the present paper some conditions about the order of magnitude of the
   divisors with respect to the perturbation entity are given and related
   to some physical parameters in the governing equations in order to
   estimate the relevance of some nonlinear effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Evolution: Why all plumes and jets evolve to round cross sections}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Turbulent curtains of smoke rise initially as flat plumes and, above a
   certain height, they become round plumes. The same evolution of
   cross-sectional shape is exhibited by jets issuing from flat nozzles.
   Here we predict based on principle that all such flows should evolve
   their cross-sectional shapes from flat to round (and not the other way)
   at a critical distance downstream, which is predictable. The principle
   is that the prevailing flow architecture provides greater access to the
   flow of momentum from the moving core (plume, jet) to the still
   surroundings. For turbulent plumes and jets, the transition distance
   scales with the long dimensions (L) of the two-dimensional (flat) heat
   sources and nozzles that drive them. For laminar jets, the transition
   distance scales with L Re, where Re is the Reynolds number based on
   nozzle velocity and the smaller dimension of the nozzle cross section.
   These predictions are confirmed by full numerical experiments of the
   three-dimensional flow fields of turbulent and laminar jets covering the
   Re range 10-10(4).}},

Abstract = {{The performance of optical coatings may be negatively affected by the
   deleterious effects of mechanical stress. In this work, we propose an
   optimization tool for the design of optical filters taking into account
   both the optical and mechanical properties of the substrate and of the
   individual deposited layers. The proposed method has been implemented as
   a supplemental module in the OpenFilters open source design software. It
   has been experimentally validated by fabricating multilayer stacks using
   e-beam evaporation, in combination with their mechanical stress
   assessment performed as a function of temperature. Two different
   stress-compensation strategies were evaluated: (a) design of two
   complementary coatings on either side of the substrate and (b)
   implementing the mechanical properties of the individual materials in
   the design of the optical coating on one side only. This approach has
   been tested by the manufacture of a Fabry-Perot etalon used in astronomy
   while using evaporated SiO2 and TiO2 films. We found that the substrate
   curvature can be decreased by 85\% and 49\% for the first and second
   strategies, respectively. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We present a particle-based method for the immunospecific capture and
   confinement of cells using acoustic radiation forces. Ultrasonic
   standing waves in microfluidic systems have previously been used for the
   continuous focusing of cells in rapid screening and sorting
   applications. In aqueous fluids, cells typically exhibit positive
   acoustic contrast and are thus forced toward the pressure nodes of a
   standing wave. Conversely, elastomeric particles exhibit negative
   acoustic contrast and travel toward the pressure antinodes. We have
   developed a class of elastomeric particles that are synthesized in bulk
   using a simple nucleation and growth process, providing precise control
   over their size and functional properties. We demonstrate that the
   biofunctionalization of these particles can allow the capture and
   transport of cells to the pressure antinodes solely via acoustic
   radiation forces, which may enable new acoustics-based cell handling
   techniques such as the washing, labeling, and sorting of cells with
   minimal preparatory steps.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered skeletal muscle can serve as a physiological model of
   natural muscle and a potential therapeutic vehicle for rapid repair of
   severe muscle loss and injury. Here, we describe a platform for
   engineering and testing highly functional biomimetic muscle tissues with
   a resident satellite cell niche and capacity for robust myogenesis and
   self-regeneration in vitro. Using a mouse dorsal window implantation
   model and transduction with fluorescent intracellular calcium indicator,
   GCaMP3, we nondestructively monitored, in real time, vascular
   integration and the functional state of engineered muscle in vivo.
   During a 2-wk period, implanted engineered muscle exhibited a steady
   ingrowth of blood-perfused microvasculature along with an increase in
   amplitude of calcium transients and force of contraction. We also
   demonstrated superior structural organization, vascularization, and
   contractile function of fully differentiated vs. undifferentiated

Title = {{Improved singular boundary method for elasticity problems}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{73-82}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple approach to evaluate origin intensity
   factors of the singular boundary method (SBM), a recent strong-form
   boundary discretization numerical technique. The SBM overcomes the
   perplexing `fictitious boundary issue' associated with the method of
   fundamental solutions (MFS) and in it the source points and collocation
   points coincide on the real physical boundary. By analogy with the
   boundary element method (BEM), we develop a desingularization strategy
   for the direct computation of singular kernels in the SBM, without
   losing the merits of being truly meshless, integration-free, and
   easy-to-implement. In addition, an efficient non-linear co-ordinate
   transformation is employed to tackle the near singularities of the
   kernel functions, when the calculation point is close to, but not on,
   the boundary. It is shown that the proposed SBM fully inherits the
   merits of the BEM and MFS. The advantages, disadvantages and potential
   applications of the proposed method, as compared with the MFS and the
   BEM, are also examined and discussed in detail. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   that such a time-varying transistor-based metamaterial exhibits this
   tunability. The tunability is applicable to a wide range of time scales,
   from quasi-static effective parameter tuning to parametric pumping for
   mixing and phase conjugation. We then apply the metamaterial to a
   particular application of phase conjugation and demonstrate through
   simulation and experiment that a very strong phase conjugated signal is
   produced. We experimentally show that the mixing efficiency for a
   transistor metamaterial is over 30 dB stronger than that of a

Abstract = {{A new kind of prism element with a triangular base is presented for
   discretization of multi-scale layered structures within the
   discontinuous Galerkin time-domain framework. Mixed-order
   curl-conforming vector basis functions are used in the triangular bases
   of the prismatic element. The height of the prism adopts spectral basis
   functions based on Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre polynomials, with an arbitrary
   order of interpolation. This method combines the flexibility of
   triangles with the accuracy of spectral elements for layered structures.
   Eigenvalues obtained show better results than traditional finite
   elements using tetrahedrons and hexahedrons. For transient analysis, the
   implicit Crank-Nicholson method is implemented for sequential
   sub-domains. This kind of arrangement of sub-domains produces a block
   tridiagonal linear system, thus allowing a block Thomas algorithm to
   solve the system efficiently. A package-to-chip example shows the
   efficacy of this method.}},

Abstract = {{The morphological evolution of shallow tidal systems strongly depends on
   gradients in transport that control sediment erosion and deposition. A
   spatially refined quantitative description of suspended sediment
   patterns and dynamics is therefore a key requirement to address issues
   connected with dynamical trends, responses, and conservation of these
   systems. Here we use a combination of numerical models of sediment
   transport dynamics, high temporal resolution point observations, and
   high spatial resolution remote sensing data to overcome the intrinsic
   limitations of traditional monitoring approaches and to establish the
   robustness of numerical models in reproducing space-time suspended
   sediment concentration (SSC) patterns. The comparison of SSC
   distributions in the Venice Lagoon (Italy) computed with a numerical
   model with SSC retrievals from remote sensing data allows us to define
   the ability of the model to properly describe spatial patterns and
   gradients in the SSC fields. The use of point observations similarly
   allows us to constrain the model temporally, thus leading to a complete
   space-time evaluation of model abilities. Our results highlight the
   fundamental control exerted on sediment transport intensity and patterns
   by the sheltering effect associated with artificial and natural
   intertidal landforms. Furthermore, we show how the stabilizing effect of
   benthic vegetation is a main control of sediment dynamics at the system
   scale, confirming a notion previously established in the laboratory or
   at small field scales.}},

Abstract = {{Differentiating stem cells using gene delivery is a key strategy in
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Nonviral gene
   delivery bypasses several safety concerns associated with viral gene
   delivery; however, leading nonviral techniques, such as electroporation,
   subject cells to high stress and can result in poor cell viabilities.
   Inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) has been shown to
   mitigate apoptotic mechanisms associated with detachment and freezing of
   induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells; however,
   inhibiting ROCK in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for improving gene
   delivery applications has not been reported previously. In this study,
   we hypothesized that ROCK Inhibitor (RI) would improve cell viability
   and gene expression in primary human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal
   cells (hUCMSCs) when transfected via Nucleofection (TM). As
   hypothesized, the pre-treatment and post-treatment of hUCMSCs
   transfected via nucleofection with Y-27632-RI significantly improved
   survival rates of hUCMSCs and gene expression as measured by green
   fluorescent protein intensity. This study provides the first comparative
   look at the effect of Y-27632-RI on hUCMSCs that underwent transfection
   via nucleofection and shows that using Y-27632-RI in concert with
   nucleofection could greatly enhance the utility of differentiating and
   reprogramming hUCMSCs for tissue engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{This multi-year study set out to establish a comprehensive knowledgebase
   for a fringing coral reef in the Gulf of Suez, while also investigating
   the link between coral reef survivability and the extreme environmental
   conditions present in the region. The Gulf of Suez is a narrow branch of
   the northern Red Sea for which all forms of environmental and scientific
   data are severely lacking. Monitoring oceanographic and meteorological
   data provides evidence of both seasonal variability and interannual
   variability in this region, and may reveal correlations between reef
   health and prevailing climate conditions. Specifically, this research
   sought to document the environmental conditions under which Zaki's Reef,
   a small fringing coral reef (29.5 degrees N and 32.4 degrees E) that
   lies at the northernmost limit of tropical reefs worldwide, is able to
   survive, in order to determine how extreme the conditions are. Results
   of observed seawater temperature revealed that coral species at Zaki's
   Reef regularly experience 2-4 degrees C and 10-15 degrees C daily and
   seasonal temperature variations, respectively. Seawater temperature
   monthly means reached a minimum of 14 degrees C in February and a
   maximum of 33 degrees C in August Monthly mean sea surface temperature
   climatology obtained from satellite measurements was comparable to
   observed seawater temperatures, while annual air and seawater
   temperature means were identical at 22 degrees C. Observed seawater
   temperatures exceeded established coral bleaching thresholds for
   extended periods of time, suggesting that coral species at this location
   may have developed a mechanism to cope with such extreme temperatures.
   Further scrutiny of these species and the mechanisms by which they are
   able to thrive is recommended. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   biocompatible fluorosurfactant with nonionic tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl
   (Iris) polar head groups. We have further demonstrated compatibility of

Abstract = {{Intrinsic resistance of glioma cells to radiation and chemotherapy is
   currently hypothesized to be partially attributed to the existence of
   cancer stem cells. Emerging studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells
   may serve as a potential carrier for delivery of therapeutic genes to
   disseminated glioma cells. However, the tropism character of mesenchymal
   stem cells for cancer stem cell-like glioma cells has rarely been
   described. In this study, we obtained homologous bone marrow-derived
   (BM-) and adipose tissue-derived (AT-) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
   fibroblast, and cancer stem cell-like glioma cells (CSGCs) from
   tumor-bearing mice, and compared the tropism character of BM- and
   AT-MSCs for CSGCs with various form of existence. To characterize the
   cell proliferation and differentiation, the spheroids of CSGCs were
   cultured on the surface of the substrate with different stiffness,
   combined with or withdrew basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and
   epidermal growth factor (EGF) in medium. Our results showed that the
   CSGCs during the process of cell proliferation, but not in resting and
   differentiated status, display strong tropism characteristics on both
   BM- and AT-MSCs, as well as the expression of their cell chemokine
   factors which mediate cell migration. If the conclusion is further
   confirmed, it may expose a fatal flaw of MSCs as tumor-targeted delivery
   of therapeutic agents in the treatment of the CSGCs, even other cancer
   stem cells, because there always exist a part of cancer stem cells that
   are in resting status. Overall, our findings provide novel insight into
   the complex issue of the MSCs as drug delivery in the treatment of brain
   tumors, especially in tumor stem cells.}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Quorum sensing (QS) enables bacteria to sense and respond to changes in
   their population density. It plays a critical role in controlling
   different biological functions, including bioluminescence and bacterial
   virulence. It has also been widely adapted to program robust dynamics in
   one or multiple cellular populations. While QS systems across bacteria
   all appear to function similarly-as density-dependent control
   systems-there is tremendous diversity among these systems in terms of
   signaling components and network architectures. This diversity hampers
   efforts to quantify the general control properties of QS. For a specific
   QS module, it remains unclear how to most effectively characterize its
   regulatory properties in a manner that allows quantitative predictions
   of the activation dynamics of the target gene. Using simple kinetic
   models, here we show that the dominant temporal dynamics of
   QS-controlled target activation can be captured by a generic metric,
   `sensing potential', defined at a single time point. We validate these
   predictions using synthetic QS circuits in Escherichia coli. Our work
   provides a computational framework and experimental methodology to
   characterize diverse natural QS systems and provides a concise yet
   quantitative criterion for selecting or optimizing a QS system for
   synthetic biology applications.}},

Abstract = {{The role of graphene in enabling deoxidation of silver nanostructures,
   thereby contributing to enhance plasmonic properties and to improve the
   temporal stability of graphene/silver hybrids for both general plasmonic
   and meta-materials applications, as well as for surface enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) substrates, is demonstrated. The chemical mechanism
   occurring at the graphene-silver oxide interface is based on the
   reduction of silver oxide triggered by graphene that acts as a shuttle
   of electrons and as a kind of catalyst in the deoxidation. A mechanism
   is formulated, combining elements of electron transfer, role of defects
   in graphene, and electrochemical potentials of graphene, silver, and
   oxygen. Therefore, the formulated model represents a step forward from
   the simple view of graphene as barrier to oxygen diffusion proposed so
   far in literature. Single layer graphene grown by chemical vapor
   deposition is transferred onto silver thin films, a periodic silver
   fishnet structure fabricated by nanoimprint lithography, and onto silver
   nanoparticle ensembles supporting a localized surface plasmon resonance
   in the visible range. Through the study of these nanostructured
   graphene/Ag hybrids, the effectiveness of graphene in preventing and
   reducing oxidation of silver plasmonic structures, keeping silver in a
   metallic state over months at air exposure, is demonstrated. The
   enhanced and stable plasmonic properties of the silver-fishnet/graphene
   hybrids are evaluated through their SERS response for detecting benzyl
   mercaptane.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas the beneficial effects of urban vegetation have long been
   recognized, growing conditions in urban environments, especially for
   street trees, are typically harsh and limited by low water availability.
   Supplemental irrigation may be used to preserve aesthetic quality and
   ability to provide ecosystem services of urban vegetation but requires
   careful management of available economic and water resources to reduce
   urban water footprint. To this purpose, decision makers need
   quantitative tools, requiring few, physically based parameters and
   accounting for the uncertainties and future scenarios of the
   hydroclimatic forcing. Focusing on in-row and isolated trees, a
   minimalist description of street tree water balance is proposed here,
   including rainfed and irrigated conditions, and explicitly accounting
   for tree water requirements, growing conditions (in terms of soil
   properties and extension of bare soil, permeable and impervious
   pavements surrounding the tree) and rainfall unpredictability. The
   proposed model allows the quantification of tree cooling capacity, water
   stress occurrence and irrigation requirements, as a function of soil,
   plant and climate characteristics, thus providing indications regarding
   the tree ability to provide ecosystem services and management costs. In
   particular, an analysis of different planting designs suggests that a
   balanced design consisting in bare soil and permeable pavement with size
   equal to the lateral canopy extension is optimal for water conservation,
   tree cooling capacity and health. The proposed model provides useful
   indications towards the definition of site-specific guidelines for
   species selection and planting design, for sustainable urban vegetation.

Abstract = {{Internalization into cancer cells is a significant challenge in the
   delivery of many anticancer therapeutics. Drug carriers can address this
   challenge by facilitating cellular uptake of cytotoxic cargo in the
   tumor, while preventing cellular uptake in healthy tissues. Here we
   describe an extrinsically controlled drug carrier, a nanopeptifier, that
   amplifies cellular uptake by modulating the activity of cell-penetrating
   peptides with thermally toggled self-assembly of a genetically encoded
   polypeptide nanoparticle. When appended with a proapoptotic peptide, the
   nanopeptifier creates a cytotoxic switch, inducing apoptosis only in its
   self-assembled state. The nanopeptifier provides a new approach to tune
   the cellular uptake and activity of anticancer therapeutics by an
   extrinsic thermal trigger.}},

Abstract = {{Cetaceans evolved flippers that are unique in both size and shape
   probably due to selection pressures associated with foraging and body
   size. Flippers function as control surfaces for maneuverability and
   stability. Flippers of cetaceans and engineered hydrofoils are similar
   with streamlined cross-sections and wing-like planforms, which affect
   lift, drag and hydrodynamic efficiency. Scale models of the flippers
   from large-bodied (body length > 6m) cetaceans (fin whale, killer whale,
   sperm whale) were constructed from computed tomography (CT) scans of
   flippers. Flipper planforms were highly tapered for the fin whale, a
   rounded, paddle-like design for the killer whale, and a square geometry
   for the sperm whale. Hydrodynamic properties of the models at varying
   angles of attack (-40o to 40(o)) were determined in a water tunnel with
   a multi-axis load cell. The flippers were found to have hydrodynamic
   characteristics similar to engineered wings. Differences in flipper
   morphology of large-bodied cetaceans and their hydrodynamic performance
   are associated with the requirements of aquatic locomotion involved with
   ecology of the whales. The flippers of the killer whale provided the
   greatest maneuverability, whereas the flippers of the fin whale had low
   drag for lunging and the flippers of the sperm whale provided lift for
   diving.}},

Abstract = {{Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are known for the variety and
   complexity of their feeding behaviors. Here we report on the use of
   synchronous motion and acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) to provide the
   first detailed kinematic descriptions of humpback whales using bottom
   side-rolls (BSRs) to feed along the seafloor. We recorded 3,505 events
   from 19 animals (individual range 8-722). By animal, mean BSR duration
   ranged from 14.1 s to 36.2 s.; mean body roll angle from 80o to 121o,
   and mean pitch from 7o to 38o. The median interval between sequential
   BSRs, by animal, ranged from 24.0 s to 63.6 s and animals tended to
   maintain a consistent BSR heading during long BSR series encompassing
   multiple dives. BSRs were most frequent between 2200 and 0400. We
   identify three classes of behavior: simple side-roll, side-roll
   inversion, and repetitive scooping. Results indicate that BSR feeding is
   a common technique in the study area and there is both coordination and
   noncoordination between animals. We argue that this behavior is not
   lunge feeding as normally characterized, because animals are moving
   slowly through the event. The behavior also leads to vulnerability to
   entanglement in bottom-set fishing gear, a major mortality factor for
   the species.}},

   review previous studies that deployed single-pin transmitters and
   determine factors that influence transmission duration. Then, test these
   factors utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to identify
   an optimal single-pin satellite-linked tag design, and evaluate this
   prototype through field studies. A review of four projects, which
   deployed 77 single-pin radio tags, determined that tags attached along
   the lower third of the dorsal fin and approximately 33 mm from the
   trailing edge resulted in longer transmission durations and reduced
   negative impacts to the dorsal fin. Based upon these results and CFD
   modeling, prototype, single-pin satellite-linked tags (n = 25)
   transmitted for 163 +/- 22 d (mean +/- 95\% CI) which greatly exceeded
   transmissions for previous small cetacean telemetry studies. These
   results suggest that the newly developed single-pin satellite-linked tag
   design strikes a balance between reducing impacts to the individual
   while maximizing transmissions.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-logging tags are widely used to study the behavior and movements of
   marine mammals with the tacit assumption of little impact to the animal.
   However, tags on fast-swimming animals generate substantial hydrodynamic
   forces potentially affecting behavior and energetics adversely, or
   promoting early removal of the tag. In this work, hydrodynamic loading
   of three novel tag housing designs are compared over a range of swimming
   speeds using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Results from CFD
   simulation were verified using tag models in a water flume with close
   agreement. Drag forces were reduced by minimizing geometric disruptions
   to the flow around the housing, while lift forces were reduced by
   minimizing the frontal cross-sectional area of the housing and holding
   the tag close to the attachment surface. Hydrodynamic tag design
   resulted in an experimentally measured 60\% drag force reduction in 5.6
   m/s flow. For all housing designs, off-axis flow increased the magnitude
   of the force on the tag. Experimental work with a common dolphin
   (Delphinus delphis) cadaver indicates that the suction cups used to
   attach the types of tags described here provide sufficient attachment
   force to resist failure to predicted forces at swimming speeds of up to
   10 m/s.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), a noninvasive first-line
   therapy for millions of nephrolithiasis patients, has not improved
   substantially in the past two decades, especially in regard to stone
   clearance. Here, we report a new acoustic lens design for a contemporary
   electromagnetic (EM) shock wave lithotripter, based on recently acquired
   knowledge of the key lithotripter field characteristics that correlate
   with efficient and safe SWL. The new lens design addresses concomitantly
   three fundamental drawbacks in EM lithotripters, namely, narrow focal
   width, nonidealized pulse profile, and significant misalignment in
   acoustic focus and cavitation activities with the target stone at high
   output settings. Key design features and performance of the new lens
   were evaluated using model calculations and experimental measurements
   against the original lens under comparable acoustic pulse energy (E+) of
   40 mJ. The -6-dB focal width of the new lens was enhanced from 7.4 to 11
   mm at this energy level, and peak pressure (41 MPa) and maximum
   cavitation activity were both realigned to be within 5 mm of the
   lithotripter focus. Stone comminution produced by the new lens was
   either statistically improved or similar to that of the original lens
   under various in vitro test conditions and was significantly improved in
   vivo in a swine model (89\% vs. 54\%, P = 0.01), and tissue injury was
   minimal using a clinical treatment protocol. The general principle and
   associated techniques described in this work can be applied to design
   improvement of all EM lithotripters.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To explore spatial variability within the cervix and the
   sensitivity of shear wave speed (SWS) to assess softness/stiffness
   differences in ripened (softened) vs unripened tissue.
   Methods We obtained SWS estimates from hysterectomy specimens (n=22), a
   subset of which were ripened (n=13). Multiple measurements were made
   longitudinally along the cervical canal on both the anterior and
   posterior sides of the cervix. Statistical tests of differences in the
   proximal vs distal, anterior vs posterior and ripened vs unripened
   cervix were performed with individual two-sample t-tests and a linear
   mixed model.
   Results Estimates of SWS increase monotonically from distal to proximal
   longitudinally along the cervix, they vary in the anterior compared to
   the posterior cervix and they are significantly different in ripened vs
   unripened cervical tissue. Specifically, the mid position SWS estimates
   for the unripened group were 3.45 +/- 0.95 m/s (anterior; mean +/- SD)
   and 3.56 +/- 0.92 m/s (posterior), and 2.11 +/- 0.45 m/s (anterior) and
   2.68 +/- 0.57 m/s (posterior) for the ripened group (P<0.001).

Abstract = {{The complexity and scale of brain-computer interface (BCI) studies limit
   our ability to investigate how humans learn to use BCI systems. It also
   limits our capacity to develop adaptive algorithms needed to assist
   users with their control. Adaptive algorithm development is forced
   offline and typically uses static data sets. But this is a poor
   substitute for the online, dynamic environment where algorithms are
   ultimately deployed and interact with an adapting user. This work
   evaluates a paradigm that simulates the control problem faced by human
   subjects when controlling a BCI, but which avoids the many complications
   associated with full-scale BCI studies. Biological learners can be
   studied in a reductionist way as they solve BCI-like control problems,
   and machine learning algorithms can be developed and tested in closed
   loop with the subjects before being translated to full BCIs. The method
   is to map 19 joint angles of the hand (representing neural signals) to
   the position of a 2D cursor which must be piloted to displayed targets
   (a typical BCI task). An investigation is presented on how closely the
   joint angle method emulates BCI systems; a novel learning algorithm is
   evaluated, and a performance difference between genders is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Complex three-dimensional (3-D) heart structure is an important
   determinant of cardiac electrical and mechanical function. In this
   study, we set to develop a versatile tissue-engineered system that can
   promote important aspects of cardiac functional maturation and reproduce
   variations in myofiber directions present in native ventricular
   epicardium. We cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes within a 3-D
   hydrogel environment using microfabricated elastomeric molds with
   hexagonal posts. By varying individual post orientations along the
   directions derived from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging
   (DTMRI) maps of human ventricle, we created large (2.5 x 2.5 cm(2)) 3-D
   cardiac tissue patches with cardiomyocyte alignment that replicated
   human epicardial fiber orientations. After 3 weeks of culture, the
   advanced structural and functional maturation of the engineered 3-D
   cardiac tissues compared to age-matched 2-D monolayers was evident from:
   1) the presence of dense, aligned and electromechanically-coupled
   cardiomyocytes, quiescent fibroblasts, and interspersed capillary-like
   structures, 2) action potential propagation with near-adult conduction
   velocity and directional dependence on local cardiomyocyte orientation,
   and 3) robust formation of T-tubules aligned with Z-disks,
   colocalization of L-type Ca2+ channels and ryanodine receptors, and
   accelerated Ca2+ transient kinetics. This biomimetic tissue-engineered
   platform can enable systematic in vitro studies of cardiac structure
   function relationships and promote the development of advanced tissue
   engineering strategies for cardiac repair and regeneration. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper reports the thermodynamic optimization of air conditioning
   systems with one or more evaporators, for one or more rooms. First, the
   paper shows that the minimization of the total power requirement leads
   to the same results as the minimization of entropy generation in the
   whole system, which includes the insulation between the cold space and
   the ambient. The results also show that there is a trade-off between the
   power lost by fluid friction in the distribution network and the power
   required by the refrigerant. This trade-off determines the optimal
   allocation of hardware in the installation. The optimum diameters of the
   refrigerant pipelines are independent of their lengths. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{The control of sound propagation and reflection has always been the goal
   of engineers involved in the design of acoustic systems. A recent design
   approach based on coordinate transformations, which is applicable to
   many physical systems(1-14), together with the development of a new
   class of engineered materials called metamaterials, has opened the road
   to the unconstrained control of sound. However, the ideal material
   parameters prescribed by this methodology are complex and challenging to
   obtain experimentally, even using metamaterial design approaches. Not
   surprisingly, experimental demonstration of devices obtained using
   transformation acoustics is difficult, and has been implemented only in
   two-dimensional configurations(10,15). Here, we demonstrate the design
   and experimental characterization of an almost perfect
   three-dimensional, broadband, and, most importantly, omnidirectional
   acoustic device that renders a region of space three wavelengths in
   diameter invisible to sound.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{1146-1160}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Soil CO2 efflux (F-soil) is the largest source of carbon from forests
   and reflects primary productivity as well as how carbon is allocated
   within forest ecosystems. Through early stages of stand development,
   both elevated {[}CO2] and availability of soil nitrogen (N; sum of
   mineralization, deposition, and fixation) have been shown to increase
   gross primary productivity, but the long-term effects of these factors
   on F-soil are less clear. Expanding on previous studies at the Duke
   Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site, we quantified the effects of
   elevated {[}CO2] and N fertilization on F-soil using daily measurements
   from automated chambers over 10years. Consistent with previous results,
   compared to ambient unfertilized plots, annual F-soil increased under
   elevated {[}CO2] (ca. 17\%) and decreased with N (ca. 21\%). N
   fertilization under elevated {[}CO2] reduced F-soil to values similar to
   untreated plots. Over the study period, base respiration rates increased
   with leaf productivity, but declined after productivity saturated.
   Despite treatment-induced differences in aboveground biomass, soil
   temperature and water content were similar among treatments.
   Interannually, low soil water content decreased annual F-soil from
   potential values - estimated based on temperature alone assuming
   nonlimiting soil water content - by ca. 0.7\% per 1.0\% reduction in
   relative extractable water. This effect was only slightly ameliorated by
   elevated {[}CO2]. Variability in soil N availability among plots
   accounted for the spatial variability in F-soil, showing a decrease of
   ca. 114gCm(-2)yr(-1) per 1gm(-2) increase in soil N availability, with
   consistently higher F-soil in elevated {[}CO2] plots ca. 127gC per
   100ppm {[}CO2] over the +200ppm enrichment. Altogether, reflecting
   increased belowground carbon partitioning in response to greater plant
   nutritional needs, the effects of elevated {[}CO2] and N fertilization
   on F-soil in this stand are sustained beyond the early stages of stand
   development and through stabilization of annual foliage production.}},

Abstract = {{Our long-term goal is the detection and characterization of vulnerable
   plaque in the coronary arteries of the heart using intravascular
   ultrasound (IVUS) catheters. Vulnerable plaque, characterized by a thin
   fibrous cap and a soft, lipid-rich necrotic core is a precursor to heart
   attack and stroke. Early detection of such plaques may potentially alter
   the course of treatment of the patient to prevent ischemic events. We
   have previously described the characterization of carotid plaques using
   external linear arrays operating at 9 MHz. In addition, we previously
   modified circular array IVUS catheters by short-circuiting several
   neighboring elements to produce fixed beamwidths for intravascular
   hyperthermia applications. In this paper, we modified Volcano Visions
   8.2 French, 9 MHz catheters and Volcano Platinum 3.5 French, 20 MHz
   catheters by short-circuiting portions of the array for acoustic
   radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) applications. The catheters had
   an effective transmit aperture size of 2 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively.
   The catheters were connected to a Verasonics scanner and driven with
   pushing pulses of 180 V p-p to acquire ARFI data from a soft gel phantom
   with a Young's modulus of 2.9 kPa. The dynamic response of the
   tissue-mimicking material demonstrates a typical ARFI motion of 1 to 2
   microns as the gel phantom displaces away and recovers back to its
   normal position. The hardware modifications applied to our IVUS
   catheters mimic potential beamforming modifications that could be
   implemented on IVUS scanners. Our results demonstrate that the
   generation of radiation force from IVUS catheters and the development of
   intravascular ARFI may be feasible.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that intracardiac acoustic radiation force

   contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in two-dimensional ARFI and conventional
   intracardiac echo images. In eight canine subjects, an ARFI
   imaging-electroanatomical mapping system was used to map right atrial
   ablation lesion sites and guide the acquisition of ARFI images at these
   sites before and after ablation. Readers of the ARFI images identified
   lesion sites with high sensitivity (90.2\%) and specificity (94.3\%) and
   the average measured ARFI-induced displacements were higher at unablated
   sites (11.23 +/- 1.71 mu m) than at ablated sites (6.06 +/- 0.94 mu m).
   The average lesion C (0.29 +/- 0.33) and CNR (1.83 +/- 1.75) were

Abstract = {{The degradation of ultrasonic image quality is typically attributed to
   aberration and reverberation. Although the sources and impact of
   aberration are well understood, very little is known about the source
   and impact of image degradation caused by reverberation. Reverberation
   is typically associated with multiple reflections at two interfaces
   along the same propagation path, as with the arterial wall or a metal
   sphere. However, the reverberation that results in image degradation
   includes more complex interaction between the propagating wave and the
   tissue. Simulations of wave propagation in realistic and simplified
   models of the abdominal wall are used to illustrate the characteristics
   of coherent and diffuse clutter generated by reverberation. In the
   realistic models, diffuse reverberation clutter is divided into that
   originating from the tissue interfaces and that originating from
   sub-resolution diffuse scatterers. In the simplified models, the
   magnitude of the reverberation clutter is observed as angle and density
   of the connective tissue are altered. The results suggest that
   multi-path scattering from the connective tissue/fat interfaces is a
   dominant component of reverberation clutter. Diffuse reverberation
   clutter is maximal when the connective tissue is near normal to the beam
   direction and increases with the density of connective tissue layers at
   these large angles. The presence of a thick fascial or fibrous layer at
   the distal boundary of the abdominal wall magnifies the amount of
   reverberation clutter. The simulations also illustrate that compression
   of the abdominal layer, a technique often used to mitigate clutter in
   overweight and obese patients, increases the decay of reverberation
   clutter with depth. In addition, rotation of the transducer or steering
   of the beam with respect to highly reflecting boundaries can reduce
   coherent clutter and transform it to diffuse clutter, which can be
   further reduced using coherence-based beamforming techniques. In vivo
   images of the human bladder illustrate some of the reverberation effects
   observed in simulation. (E-mail: jjd@duke.edu) (C) 2014 World Federation

Abstract = {{Commodity heterogeneous systems (e.g., integrated CPUs and GPUs), now
   support a unified, shared memory address space for all components.
   Because the latency of global communication in a heterogeneous system
   can be prohibitively high, heterogeneous systems (unlike homogeneous CPU
   systems) provide synchronization mechanisms that only guarantee ordering
   among a subset of threads, which we call a scope. Unfortunately, the
   consequences and semantics of these scoped operations are not yet well
   understood. Without a formal and approachable model to reason about the
   behavior of these operations, we risk an array of portability and
   performance issues.
   In this paper, we embrace scoped synchronization with a new class of
   memory consistency models that add scoped synchronization to
   data-race-free models like those of C++ and Java. Called sequential
   consistency for heterogeneousrace- free (SC for HRF), the new models
   guarantee SC for programs with ``sufficient{''} synchronization (no data
   races) of ``sufficient{''} scope. We discuss two such models. The first,
   HRF-direct, works well for programs with highly regular parallelism. The
   second, HRF-indirect, builds on HRF-direct by allowing synchronization
   using different scopes in some cases involving transitive communication.
   We quantitatively show that HRF-indirect encourages forward-looking
   programs with irregular parallelism by showing up to a 10\% performance
   increase in a task runtime for GPUs.}},

Abstract = {{Recently the underlying sparse representation structure in high
   dimensional data has received considerable attention in pattern
   recognition and computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel
   semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (SDR) method, named Double
   Linear Regressions (DLR), to tackle the Single Labeled Image per Person
   (SLIP) face recognition problem. DLR simultaneously seeks the best
   discriminating subspace and preserves the sparse representation
   structure. Specifically, a Subspace Assumption based Label Propagation
   (SALP) method, which is accomplished using Linear Regressions (LR), is
   first presented to propagate the label information to the unlabeled
   data. Then, based on the propagated labeled dataset, a sparse
   representation regularization term is constructed via Linear Regressions
   (LR). Finally, DLR takes into account both the discriminating efficiency
   and the sparse representation structure by using the learned sparse
   representation regularization term as a regularization term of Linear
   Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The extensive and encouraging experimental
   results on three publicly available face databases (CMU PIE, Extended
   Yale B and AR) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C)

Abstract = {{Many remote sensing applications involve the classification of anomalous
   responses as either objects of interest or clutter. This paper addresses
   the problem of anomaly classification in hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and
   focuses on robustly detecting disturbed earth in the long-wave infrared
   (LWIR) spectrum. Although disturbed earth yields a distinct LWIR
   signature that distinguishes it from the background, its distribution
   relative to clutter may vary over different environmental contexts. In
   this paper, a generic Bayesian framework is proposed for training
   context-dependent classification rules from wide-area airborne LWIR
   imagery. The proposed framework combines sparse classification models
   with either supervised or discriminative context identification to pool
   information across contexts and improve classification overall.
   Experiments are performed with data from a LWIR landmine detection
   system. Contexts are learned from endmember abundances extracted from
   the background near each detected anomaly. Classification performance is
   compared with single-classifier approaches using the same information as
   well as other baseline anomaly detectors from the literature. Results
   indicate that utilizing context for classifying anomalies in HSI could
   lead to more robust performance over varying terrain.}},

Abstract = {{A poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) (NIPAAm-co-AAm) hydrogel
   with near-infrared (NIR) absorbing silica-gold nanoshells was designed
   as a platform for pulsatile delivery of cancer therapeutics. This
   hydrogel was designed to have a lower critical solution temperature
   (LCST) above physiologic temperature, such that the material will
   transition from a hydrated state to a collapsed state above similar to
   40 degrees C. Additionally, the silica-gold nanoshells used were
   designed to have a peak extinction coefficient in the NIR, where
   penetration of light through tissue is maximal. This heat-triggered
   material phase transition of the composite was found to follow exposure
   of NIR light, indicating the ability of the NIR absorption by the
   nanoshells to sufficiently drive this transition. The composite material
   was loaded with either doxorubicin or a DNA duplex (a model nucleic acid
   therapeutic), two cancer therapeutics with differing physical and
   chemical properties. Release of both therapeutics was dramatically
   enhanced by NIR light exposure, causing 2-5x increase in drug release.
   Drug delivery profiles were influenced by both themolecular size of the
   drug as well as its chemical properties. The DNA therapeutic showed
   slower rates of nonspecific delivery by passive diffusion due to its
   larger size. Additionally, only 70\% of the more hydrophobic doxorubicin
   was released from the material, whereas the more hydrophilic DNA showed
   over 90\% release. Further, hydrogel composites were used to deliver the
   doxorubicin to CT. 26-WT colon carcinoma cells, eliciting a therapeutic
   response. This work validates the potential application for this
   material in site-specific cancer therapeutic delivery. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Significant progress has been made in understanding the toxicity of
   silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) under carefully controlled laboratory
   conditions. Natural organic matter (NOM) is omnipresent in complex

   NP suspensions with or without one of two kinds of NOM, Suwannee River
   and Pony Lake fulvic acids (SRFA and PLFA, respectively). PLFA rescued
   toxicity more effectively than SRFA. Measurement of total tissue silver
   content indicated that PLFA reduced total organismal (including
   digestive tract) uptake of ionic silver, but not of citrate-coated Ag
   NPs (CIT-Ag NPs). The majority of the CIT-Ag NP uptake was in the
   digestive tract. Limited tissue uptake was detected by hyperspectral
   microscopy but not by transmission electron microscopy. Co-exposure to
   PLFA resulted in the formation of NOM-Ag NP composites (both in medium
   and in nematodes) and rescued (g)NO3- and CIT-Ag NP-induced cellular
   damage, potentially by decreasing intracellular uptake of CIT-Ag NPs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a system composed of two pendulums attached to a
   common base that is oscillated horizontally. The pendulums share a
   common pivot line, but move independently and are only coupled together
   through collisions. Impact dynamics for the collisions of the pendulums
   with each other and with fixed barriers yield complex nonlinear
   behaviors. Careful numerical simulation of the equations of motion
   demonstrates a close correlation with experimental data collected from
   the system. There are many independent parameters in this system, and
   one of the motivations for the present study is to establish the extent
   to which we can capture observed behavior with a relatively simple
   hybrid differential equation model in the face of several independent
   energy dissipation mechanisms coming from friction and impact.
   Comparison between experiments and simulations is based on the standard
   nonlinear dynamical system analyses of time series, phase projections,
   time-lag embedding, Poincare sections, and frequency content. Grazing
   bifurcations and co-existence of impacting/non-impacting
   periodic/chaotic states are observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{One of the main computational issues with explicit dynamics simulations
   is the significant reduction of the critical time step as the spatial
   resolution of the finite element mesh increases. In this work, a
   selective mass scaling approach is presented that can significantly
   reduce the computational cost in explicit dynamic simulations, while
   maintaining accuracy. The proposed method is based on a multiscale
   decomposition approach that separates the dynamics of the system into
   low (coarse scales) and high frequencies (fine scales). Here, the
   critical time step is increased by selectively applying mass scaling on
   the fine scale component only. In problems where the response is
   dominated by the coarse (low frequency) scales, significant increases in
   the stable time step can be realized. In this work, we use the proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD) method to build the coarse scale space.
   The main idea behind POD is to obtain an optimal low-dimensional
   orthogonal basis for representing an ensemble of high-dimensional data.
   In our proposed method, the POD space is generated with snapshots of the
   solution obtained from early times of the full-scale simulation. The
   example problems addressed in this work show significant improvements in
   computational time, without heavily compromising the accuracy of the
   results. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   0.34 A/W (lambda = 470 nm - 600 nm) and 0.63 nA/cm(2), respectively, at
   similar to 0V bias. The measured responsivity and dark current density
   of the flexible PDs is 0.16 A/W -0.26 A/W (lambda = 470 nm - 600 nm) and

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Currently, no available pathological or molecular measures of tumor
   angiogenesis predict response to antiangiogenic therapies used in
   clinical practice. Recognizing that tumor endothelial cells (EC) and EC
   activation and survival signaling are the direct targets of these
   therapies, we sought to develop an automated platform for quantifying
   activity of critical signaling pathways and other biological events in
   EC of patient tumors by histopathology. Computer image analysis of EC in
   highly heterogeneous human tumors by a statistical classifier trained
   using examples selected by human experts performed poorly due to
   subjectivity and selection bias. We hypothesized that the analysis can
   be optimized by a more active process to aid experts in identifying
   informative training examples. To test this hypothesis, we incorporated
   a novel active learning (AL) algorithm into FARSIGHT image analysis
   software that aids the expert by seeking out informative examples for
   the operator to label. The resulting FARSIGHT-AL system identified EC
   with specificity and sensitivity consistently greater than 0.9 and
   outperformed traditional supervised classification algorithms. The
   system modeled individual operator preferences and generated
   reproducible results. Using the results of EC classification, we also
   quantified proliferation (Ki67) and activity in important signal
   transduction pathways (MAP kinase, STAT3) in immunostained human clear
   cell renal cell carcinoma and other tumors. FARSIGHT-AL enables
   characterization of EC in conventionally preserved human tumors in a
   more automated process suitable for testing and validating in clinical
   trials. The results of our study support a unique opportunity for
   quantifying angiogenesis in a manner that can now be tested for its
   ability to identify novel predictive and response biomarkers.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to develop tissue constructs with matrix composition and
   biomechanical properties that promote rapid tissue repair or
   regeneration remains an enduring challenge in musculoskeletal
   engineering. Current approaches require extensive cell manipulation ex
   vivo, using exogenous growth factors to drive tissue-specific
   differentiation, matrix accumulation, and mechanical properties, thus
   limiting their potential clinical utility. The ability to induce and
   maintain differentiation of stem cells in situ could bypass these steps
   and enhance the success of engineering approaches for tissue
   regeneration. The goal of this study was to generate a self-contained
   bioactive scaffold capable of mediating stem cell differentiation and
   formation of a cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) using a
   lentivirus-based method. We first showed that poly-L-lysine could
   immobilize lentivirus to poly(epsilon-caprolactone) films and facilitate
   human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) transduction. We then demonstrated
   that scaffold-mediated gene delivery of transforming growth factor beta
   3 (TGF-beta 3), using a 3D woven poly(e-caprolactone) scaffold, induced
   robust cartilaginous ECM formation by hMSCs. Chondrogenesis induced by
   scaffold- mediated gene delivery was as effective as traditional
   differentiation protocols involving medium supplementation with TGF-beta
   3, as assessed by gene expression, biochemical, and biomechanical
   analyses. Using lentiviral vectors immobilized on a biomechanically
   functional scaffold, we have developed a system to achieve sustained
   transgene expression and ECM formation by hMSCs. This method opens new
   avenues in the development of bioactive implants that circumvent the
   need for ex vivo tissue generation by enabling the long-term goal of in
   situ tissue engineering.}},

   proposed to truncate open region multi-term dispersive Finite-Difference
   Time-Domain (FDTD) lattices. These formulations are independent of
   material properties of the FDTD domains and hence can be used for
   modeling general media because of the D-B constitutive relations. A
   Three-Dimensional (3-D) simulation of the two-term Lorentz dispersive
   FDTD domain has been carried out to demonstrate the validity of the
   proposed formulations. Furthermore, in order to show the validity of the
   proposed algorithm, the second 3D inhomogeneous problem has also been
   used for validating the proposed formulations. It is clearly shown that
   the new formulations with the CFS-PML scheme are efficient in
   attenuating evanescent waves and reducing late-time reflections.}},

Title = {{In Vivo Luminescence Imaging of NF-kappa B Activity and Serum Cytokine

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate the relationship between NF-kappa B activity,
   cytokine levels, and pain sensitivities in a rodent model of
   osteoarthritis (OA).
   Methods. OA was induced in transgenic NF-kappa B-luciferase reporter
   mice via intraarticular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). Using
   luminescence imaging we evaluated the temporal kinetics of NF-kappa B
   activity and its relationship to the development of pain sensitivities
   and serum cytokine levels in this model.
   Results. MIA induced a transient increase in joint-related NF-kappa B
   activity at early time points (day 3 after injection) and an associated
   biphasic pain response (mechanical allodynia). NF-kappa B activity,
   serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1 beta, and IL-10 levels accounted for
   similar to 75\% of the variability in pain-related mechanical
   sensitivities in this model. Specifically, NF-kappa B activity was
   strongly correlated with mechanical allodynia and serum IL-6 levels in
   the inflammatory pain phase of this model (day 3), while serum IL-1 beta
   was strongly correlated with pain sensitivities in the chronic pain
   phase of the model (day 28).
   Conclusion. Our findings suggest that NF-kappa B activity, IL-6, and
   IL-1 beta may play distinct roles in pain sensitivity development in
   this model of arthritis and may distinguish the acute pain phase from
   the chronic pain phase. This study establishes luminescence imaging of
   NF-kappa B activity as a novel imaging biomarker of pain sensitivities
   in this model of OA.}},

Abstract = {{Covalent mechanochemistry within bulk polymers typically occurs with
   irreversible deformation of the parent material. Here we show that
   embedding mechanophores into an elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane)
   (PDMS) network allows for covalent bond activation under macroscopically
   reversible deformations. Using the colorimetric mechanophore spiropyran,
   we show that bond activation can be repeated over multiple cycles of
   tensile elongation with full shape recovery. Further, localized
   compression can be used to pattern strain-induced chemistry. The
   platform enables the reversibility of a secondary strain-induced color
   change to be characterized. We also observe mechanical acceleration of a
   flex-activated retro-Diels-Alder reaction, allowing a chemical signal to
   be released in response to a fully reversible deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Failures due to software aging are typically caused by resource
   exhaustion, which is often preceded by progressive software performance
   degradation. Response time as a customer-affecting metric can thus be
   used to detect the onset of software aging. In this paper, we propose
   the distribution-based rejuvenation algorithm (DBRA), which uses a
   validated M/E-2/1/K queuing model of the Apache HTTP server to decide
   when to trigger rejuvenation. We compare the performance of the DBRA
   with the one of the static rejuvenation algorithm with averaging (SRAA)
   presented by Avritzer et al. Simulation results show the effectiveness
   of the DBRA and its advantages over the SRAA in reducing the average
   response time. However, the DBRA generally tends to trigger rejuvenation
   more frequently than the SRAA, which increases the request blocking
   probability.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Toward the development of a ``green{''} technology for cleaning soil
   contaminated by halogenated hydrophobic organic contaminants, here we
   demonstrate that combined use of palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh)
   catalysts enables the conversion of 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB) to
   cyclohexane in mixtures of water and ethanol. We tested the hypotheses
   that, in batch reactors, (1) an increased ratio of water to ethanol in
   water/ethanol solvents would increase the reaction rates of both
   Pd-catalyzed hydrodehalogenation (HDH) and Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation,
   and (2) catalytic reaction rate coefficients would be constant above a
   hydrogen (H-2) pressure threshold, but would decrease with decreasing
   H-2 pressure below that threshold. These hypotheses were derived from a
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood model for the heterogeneous catalytic reactions.
   Complete conversion of TeCB to cyclohexane was achieved at all
   experimental conditions tested, suggesting that the proposed technology
   may be technically viable. Concentration data were consistent with an
   apparent first-order kinetic model in which Pd-catalyzed HDH and
   Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation occur in series. As expected, HDH and
   hydrogenation rate coefficients increased as the fraction of water in
   the solvent increased. However, contrary to expectations, HDH rate
   coefficients decreased when H-2 pressure increased from 69 to 207 to 345
   kPa. We attributed this to the displacement of TeCB by H-2 on the
   catalyst surface at higher H-2 pressures. No statistically significant
   effect of H-2 pressure on hydrogenation rate coefficients was observed.
   The findings suggest that the proposed technology should be operated
   with at least 50\% water in the solvent and a H-2 pressure as low as
   30-70 kPa.}},

Abstract = {{Metal nanoparticle (NP)-graphene multifunctional platforms are of great
   interest for exploring strong light graphene interactions enhanced by
   plasmons and for improving performance of numerous applications, such as
   sensing and catalysis. These platforms can also be used to carry out
   fundamental studies on charge transfer, and the findings can lead to new
   strategies for doping graphene. There have been a large number of
   studies on noble metal Au-graphene and Ag-graphene platforms that have
   shown their potential for a number of applications. These studies have
   also highlighted some drawbacks that must be overcome to realize high
   performance. Here we demonstrate the promise of plasmonic gallium (Ga)
   nanoparticle (NP) graphene hybrids as a means of modulating the graphene
   Fermi level, creating tunable localized surface plasmon resonances and,
   consequently, creating high-performance surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) platforms. Four prominent peculiarities of Ga,
   differentiating it from the commonly used noble (gold and silver) metals
   are (1) the ability to create tunable (from the UV to the visible)
   plasmonic platforms, (2) its chemical stability leading to long-lifetime
   plasmonic platforms, (3) its ability to n-type dope graphene, and (4)
   its weak chemical interaction with graphene, which preserves the
   integrity of the graphene lattice. As a result of these factors, a Ga
   NP-enhanced graphene Raman intensity effect has been observed. To
   further elucidate the roles of the electromagnetic enhancement (or
   plasmonic) mechanism in relation to electron transfer, we compare
   graphene-on-Ga NP and Ga NP-on-graphene SERS platforms using the
   cationic dye rhodamine B, a drug model biomolecule, as the analyte.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first pin-count-aware optimization approach for test data
   delivery over a network-on-chip (NoC). Our approach addresses the key
   issue of optimal utilization of the limited I/O resources provided by
   automated test equipment (ATE) to keep test time and test cost under
   control. By co-optimizing core test scheduling and pin assignment to
   access points, test cost can be lowered by reducing test time for a
   given pin budget, or by reducing the number of test pins without
   impacting test time. To further improve resource utilization, we
   consider the use of MISRs for compacting the test responses of embedded
   cores. We show how the optimization framework can be extended to include
   power constraints during test application. Experimental results for
   ITC'02 test benchmarks demonstrate that pin-count-aware co-optimization
   leads to shorter test times for a given pin-count budget and fewer pins
   for a given test-time budget. Comparisons with dedicated bus-based
   test-access mechanism designs and a baseline heuristic method are
   presented; our results demonstrate the benefits of the co-optimization
   method for NoC-based test access. The results also highlight the
   advantages of the proposed use of output compaction and the impact of
   power constraints on the optimized test schedule and test-access
   architecture.}},

Title = {{A Tetraploid Intermediate Precedes Aneuploid Formation in Yeasts Exposed
   to Fluconazole}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Candida albicans, the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, is generally
   diploid. However, 50\% of isolates that are resistant to fluconazole
   (FLC), the most widely used antifungal, are aneuploid and some
   aneuploidies can confer FLC resistance. To ask if FLC exposure causes or
   only selects for aneuploidy, we analyzed diploid strains during exposure
   to FLC using flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy. FLC exposure
   caused a consistent deviation from normal cell cycle regulation: nuclear
   and spindle cycles initiated prior to bud emergence, leading to
   trimeras, three connected cells composed of a mother, daughter, and
   granddaughter bud. Initially binucleate, trimeras underwent coordinated
   nuclear division yielding four daughter nuclei, two of which underwent
   mitotic collapse to form a tetraploid cell with extra spindle
   components. In subsequent cell cycles, the abnormal number of spindles
   resulted in unequal DNA segregation and viable aneuploid progeny. The
   process of aneuploid formation in C. albicans is highly reminiscent of
   early stages in human tumorigenesis in that aneuploidy arises through a
   tetraploid intermediate and subsequent unequal DNA segregation driven by
   multiple spindles coupled with a subsequent selective advantage
   conferred by at least some aneuploidies during growth under stress.
   Finally, trimera formation was detected in response to other azole
   antifungals, in related Candida species, and in an in vivo model for
   Candida infection, suggesting that aneuploids arise due to azole
   treatment of several pathogenic yeasts and that this can occur during
   the infection process.
   Author Summary Fungal infections are a particularly challenging problem
   in medicine due to the small number of effective antifungal drugs
   available. Fluconazole, the most commonly prescribed antifungal,
   prevents cells from growing but does not kill them, giving the fungal
   population a window of opportunity to become drug resistant. Candida
   albicans is the most prevalent fungal pathogen, and many
   fluconazole-resistant strains of this microbe have been isolated in the
   clinic. Fluconazole-resistant isolates often contain an abnormal number
   of chromosomes (a state called aneuploidy), and the additional copies of
   drug resistance genes on those chromosomes enable the cells to
   circumvent the drug. How Candida cells acquire abnormal chromosome
   numbers is a very important medical questionis aneuploidy merely
   passively selected for, or is it actively induced by the drug treatment?
   In this study, we found that fluconazole and other related azole
   antifungals induce abnormal cell cycle progression in which mother and
   daughter cells fail to separate after chromosome segregation. Following
   a further growth cycle, these cells form an unusual cell type that we
   have termed trimerasthree-lobed cells with two nuclei. The aberrant
   chromosome segregation dynamics in trimeras produce progeny with double
   the normal number of chromosomes. Unequal chromosome segregation in
   these progeny leads to an increase in the prevalence of aneuploidy in
   the population. We postulate that the increase in aneuploidy greatly
   increases the odds of developing drug resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We consider uplink relay-assisted MIMO cellular systems with multiple
   relays deployed in each cell that perform the amplify-and-forward
   operations. We are interested in obtaining deterministic expressions for
   the ergodic sum rate of such systems. We first consider the large MIMO
   dimension scenario, and obtain two asymptotic sum rate expressions,
   corresponding to the cases of fixed number of users and large number of
   users, respectively. We then consider the case of arbitrary MIMO
   dimension and large number of users, and obtain an upper and lower bound
   that the sum rate lies in between with high probability. The bounds are
   tight when the number of users is large. Both single-cell and multi-cell
   systems are considered, where the latter assumes full base station
   cooperation. Numerical experiments show that these deterministic sum
   rate expressions match well with the Monte Carlo simulation results.
   Therefore they can be useful tools for the design and analysis of
   relay-assisted MIMO cellular systems.}},

Title = {{An analysis of the uncertainty and bias in DCE-MRI measurements using
   the spoiled gradient-recalled echo pulse sequence}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from dynamic
   contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI have been used in more than 100 phase I
   trials and investigator led studies. A comparison of the absolute values
   of these quantities requires an estimation of their respective
   probability distribution function (PDF). The statistical variation of
   the DCE-MRI measurement is analyzed by considering the fundamental
   sources of error in the MR signal intensity acquired with the spoiled
   gradient-echo (SPGR) pulse sequence.
   Methods: The variance in the SPGR signal intensity arises from
   quadrature detection and excitation flip angle inconsistency. The noise
   power was measured in 11 phantoms of contrast agent concentration in the
   range {[}0-1] mM (in steps of 0.1 mM) and in one in vivo acquisition of
   a tumor-bearing mouse. The distribution of the flip angle was determined
   in a uniform 10 mM CuSO4 phantom using the spin echo double angle
   method. The PDF of a wide range of T1 values measured with the varying
   flip angle (VFA) technique was estimated through numerical simulations
   of the SPGR equation. The resultant uncertainty in contrast agent
   concentration was incorporated in the most common model of tracer
   exchange kinetics and the PDF of the derived pharmacokinetic parameters
   was studied numerically.
   Results: The VFA method is an unbiased technique for measuring T1 only
   in the absence of bias in excitation flip angle. The time-dependent
   concentration of the contrast agent measured in vivo is within the
   theoretically predicted uncertainty. The uncertainty in measuring
   K-trans with SPGR pulse sequences is of the same order, but always
   higher than, the uncertainty in measuring the pre-injection longitudinal
   relaxation time (T1(0)). The lowest achievable bias/uncertainty in
   estimating this parameter is approximately 20\%-70\% higher than the
   bias/uncertainty in the measurement of the pre-injection T1 map. The
   fractional volume parameters derived from the extended Tofts model were
   found to be extremely sensitive to the variance in signal intensity. The
   SNR of the pre-injection T1 map indicates the limiting precision with
   which Ktrans can be calculated.
   Conclusions: Current small-animal imaging systems and pulse sequences
   robust to motion artifacts have the capacity for reproducible
   quantitative acquisitions with DCE-MRI. In these circumstances, it is
   feasible to achieve a level of precision limited only by physiologic
   variability. c 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{The contractility status of trabecular meshwork (TM) cells influences
   aqueous humor outflow resistance and intraocular pressure. Using human
   TM cells as a model, the goal of the present study was to examine
   concentration response relationships of two prototypical molecules,
   nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), known to differentially
   influence vascular smooth muscle contractility. Efficacy of ET-1, two NO
   donors (DETA-NO and SNP) and a cGMP analog (8-Br-cGMP) were assessed
   using two complementary methods: functionally in a gel contraction assay
   and biochemically using a myosin light chain phosphorylation assay. The
   NO donors DETA-NO and SNP dose dependently relaxed cultured human TM
   cells (EC50 for DETA-NO = 6.0 +/- 2.4 mu M, SNP = 12.6 +/- 8.8 mu M),
   with maximum effects at 100 mu M. Interestingly, at concentrations of NO
   donors above 100 mu M, the relaxing effect was lost. Relaxation caused
   by DETANO (100 mu M) was dose dependently blocked by the soluble
   guanylate cyclase specific inhibitor ODQ (IC50 = 460 +/- 190 mu M). In
   contrast to the NO donors, treatment of cells with the cGMP analog,
   8-Br-cGMP produced the largest relaxation (109.4\%) that persisted at
   high concentrations (EC50 = 110 +/- 40 mu M). ET-1 caused a
   dose-dependent contraction of human TM cells (EC50 = 1.5 +/- 0.5 mu M),
   with maximum effect at 100 mu M (56.1\%) and this contraction was
   reversed by DETA-NO (100 pM). Consistent with functional data,
   phosphorylation status of myosin light chain was dose dependently
   reduced with DETA-NO, and increased with ET-1. Together, data show that
   TM cells rapidly change their contractility status over a wide dynamic
   range, well suited for the regulation of outflow resistance and
   intraocular pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In vivo ultrasonic imaging with transducer arrays suffers from image
   degradation resulting from beamforming limitations, including
   diffraction-limited beamforming and beamforming degradation caused by
   tissue inhomogeneity. Additionally, based on recent studies, multipath
   scattering also causes significant image degradation. To reduce
   degradation from both sources, we propose a model-based signal
   decomposition scheme. The proposed algorithm identifies spatial
   frequency signatures to decompose received wavefronts into their most
   significant scattering sources. Scattering sources originating from a
   region of interest are used to reconstruct decluttered wavefronts, which
   are beamformed into decluttered RF scan lines or A-lines.
   To test the algorithm, ultrasound system channel data were acquired
   during liver scans from 8 patients. Multiple data sets were acquired
   from each patient, with 55 total data sets, 43 of which had identifiable
   hypoechoic regions on normal B-mode images. The data sets with
   identifiable hypoechoic regions were analyzed. The results show the
   decluttered B-mode images have an average improvement in contrast over
   normal images of 7.3 +/- 4.6 dB. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
   changed little on average between normal and decluttered B-mode, -0.4

Title = {{Validation and sensitivity of the FINE Bayesian network for forecasting

Abstract = {{The adaptive nature of the Forecasting the Impacts of Nanomaterials in
   the Environment (FINE) Bayesian network is explored. We create an
   updated FINE model (FINEAgNp-2) for predicting aquatic exposure
   concentrations of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) by combining the
   expert-based parameters from the baseline model established in previous
   work with literature data related to particle behavior, exposure, and
   nano-ecotoxicology via parameter learning. We validate the AgNP forecast
   from the updated model using mesocosm-scale field data and determine the
   sensitivity of several key variables to changes in environmental
   conditions, particle characteristics, and particle fate. Results show
   that the prediction accuracy of the FINEAgNp-2 model increased
   approximately 70\% over the baseline model, with an error rate of only
   20\%, suggesting that FINE is a reliable tool to predict aquatic
   concentrations of nano-silver. Sensitivity analysis suggests that
   fractal dimension, particle diameter, conductivity, time, and particle
   fate have the most influence on aquatic exposure given the current
   knowledge; however, numerous knowledge gaps can be identified to suggest
   further research efforts that will reduce the uncertainty in subsequent
   exposure and risk forecasts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{34-42}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The study of recession flows offers fundamental insights into basin
   hydrological processes and, in particular, into the collective behavior
   of the governing dominant subsurface flows and properties. We use here
   an existing geomorphological interpretation of recession dynamics, which
   links the exponent in the classic recession curve -dQ/dt - kQ(alpha) to
   the geometric properties of the time-varying drainage network to study
   the general properties of recession curves across a wide variety of
   river basins. In particular, we show how the parameter k depends on the
   initial soil moisture state of the basin and can be made to explicitly
   depend on an index discharge, representative of initial sub-subsurface
   storage. Through this framework we obtain a non-dimensional,
   event-independent, recession curve. We subsequently quantify the
   variability of k across different basins on the basis of their geometry,
   and, by rescaling, collapse curves from different events and basins to
   obtain a generalized, or `universal', recession curve. Finally, we
   analyze the resulting normalized recession curves and explain their
   universal characteristics, lending further support to the notion that
   the statistical properties of observed recession curves bear the
   signature of the geomorphological structure of the networks producing
   them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   using a physical-aware fault extractor and timing-aware automatic test
   pattern generation. This technique requires no DfT area overhead and no
   direct TSV probing. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that
   test coverage can be improved by 22\% and 10\% for stress-induced and
   leakage-induced TSDF, respectively. In our results, the test length
   overheads of both TSDFs are <5\%.}},

   Desolneux et al. Contrarily to the classical formulation by Desolneux et
   al. where level lines must be entirely salient, the proposed method
   allows to detect partially salient level lines, thus resulting in more
   robust and more stable detections. We then tackle the problem of
   combining two gestalts as a measure of saliency and propose a method
   that reinforces detections. Results in natural images show the good
   performance of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{The dehydration of biologics is commonly employed to achieve solid-dose
   formulation and enhanced stability during long-term preservation. We
   have developed a novel process, Microglassification(TM), which can
   rapidly and controllably dehydrate protein solutions into solid
   amorphous microspheres at room temperature. Single bovine serum albumin
   (BSA) microdroplets were suspended in pentanol or decanol using a
   micropipette, and the dynamic changes in droplet dissolution were
   observed in real-time and correlated to protein's water of hydration,
   medium's water activity, and microsphere protein concentration.
   Microglassification(TM) was also carried out at bulk scale, and changes
   in BSA secondary structure were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy; multimer formation was
   detected by native gel electrophoresis. BSA concentration in the
   microsphere increased with solvent exposure time and decreasing water
   activity. Image analysis at single particle and bulk scale showed the
   formation of solid BSA microspheres with a maximum protein concentration
   of 1147 +/- 32 mg/mL. The native BSA samples were dehydrated to
   approximately 450 waters per BSA, which is well below monolayer coverage
   of 1282 waters per BSA. The secondary structure of Microglassified(TM)
   BSA reverted to native-like conformation upon rehydration with only
   minor irreversible aggregation (2.7\%). Results of the study establish
   the efficacy of the Microglassification(TM) for the successful
   dehydration of biologics. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo present a novel technique for high-resolution stimulated echo
   diffusion tensor imaging with self-navigated interleaved spirals readout
   trajectories that can inherently and dynamically correct for image
   artifacts due to spatial and temporal variations in the static magnetic
   field (B-0) resulting from eddy currents, tissue susceptibilities,
   subject/physiological motion, and hardware instabilities.
   MethodsThe Hahn spin echo formed by the first two 90 degrees
   radiofrequency pulses is balanced to consecutively acquire two
   additional images with different echo times and generate an inherent
   field map, while the diffusion-prepared stimulated echo signal remains
   unaffected. For every diffusion-encoding direction, an intrinsically
   registered field map is estimated dynamically and used to effectively
   and inherently correct for off-resonance artifacts in the reconstruction
   of the corresponding diffusion-weighted image.
   ResultsAfter correction with the dynamically acquired field maps, local
   blurring artifacts are specifically removed from individual stimulated
   echo diffusion-weighted images and the estimated diffusion tensors have
   significantly improved spatial accuracy and larger fractional
   anisotropy.
   ConclusionCombined with the self-navigated interleaved spirals
   acquisition scheme, our new method provides an integrated
   high-resolution short-echo time diffusion tensor imaging solution with
   inherent and dynamic correction for both motion-induced phase errors and
   off-resonance effects. Magn Reson Med 71:1044-1053, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{Intervertebral disc (IVD) disorders and age-related degeneration are
   believed to contribute to lower back pain. There is significant interest
   in cell-based strategies for regenerating the nucleus pulposus (NP)
   region of the disc; however, few scaffolds have been evaluated for their
   ability to promote or maintain an immature NP cell phenotype. Previous
   studies have shown that NP cell-laminin interactions promote cell
   adhesion and biosynthesis, which suggests a laminin-functionalized
   biomaterial may be useful for promoting or maintaining the NP cell
   phenotype. Here, a photocrosslinkable poly(ethylene glycol)-laminin 111
   (PEG-LM111) hydrogel was developed. The mechanical properties of
   PEG-LM111 hydrogel could be tuned within the range of dynamic shear
   moduli values previously reported for human NP. When primary immature
   porcine NP cells were seeded onto PEG-LM111 hydrogels of varying
   stiffnesses, LM111-presenting hydrogels were found to promote cell
   clustering and increased levels of sGAG production as compared to
   stiffer LM111-presenting and PEG-only gels. When cells were encapsulated
   in 3-D gels, hydrogel formulation was found to influence NP cell
   metabolism and expression of proposed NP phenotypic markers, with higher
   expression of N-cadherin and cytokeratin 8 observed for cells cultured
   in softer (<1 kPa) PEG-LM111 hydrogels. Overall, these findings suggest
   that soft, LM111-functionalized hydrogels may promote or maintain the
   expression of specific markers characteristic of an immature NP cell
   phenotype. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Two and three-dimensional boundary element formulations of compressible

   arbitrary thickness, applied to the rolling resistance of rigid
   cylinders and spheres}},

Abstract = {{New two-dimensional and three-dimensional boundary element formulations
   of compressible viscoelastic layers of arbitrary thickness are presented
   in this work. The formulations are derived in increasing order of
   complexity for: (i) compressible isotropic layers, (ii) transversely
   isotropic layers, and (iii) fully orthotropic layers. It is further
   shown that existing 2D and 3D models for incompressible isotropic layers
   may be regarded as particular instances of case (i). The proposed
   formulations are based on Fourier series and support any linear
   viscoelastic material model characterized by general frequency-domain
   master-curves. These approaches result in a compliance matrix for the
   layer's upper boundary, which includes the effects of steady-state
   motion. This characterization may be used as a component in various
   problem settings to generate sequences of high fidelity solutions for
   varying parameters. The proposed modeling techniques are applied, in
   combination with appropriate contact solvers, to the rolling resistance
   of rigid cylinders and spheres on compressible isotropic, transversely
   isotropic and orthotropic layers. The latter case reveals that the
   dissipated power varies with the direction of motion, which suggests new
   ways of optimizing the level of damping in various engineering
   applications of very high impact. Interesting lateral viscoelastic
   effects resulting from material asymmetry are unveiled. These phenomena
   could be harnessed to achieve smooth and `invisible' guides across
   three-dimensional viscoelastic surfaces, and hence suggest new ways of
   controlling trajectories, with a broad range of potential applications.

Abstract = {{In this technical note, we propose a novel technique to control the
   relative motion of multiple mobile agents as they stabilize to a desired
   configuration. In particular, we focus on the agents' relative
   velocities and the rate of change of their pairwise distances, and
   employ constructs from classic navigation functions (NFs) to control
   these quantities. Controlling agent velocities requires nontrivial
   extensions of the NF methodology to second-order models. Although in
   this work we propose a centralized framework to control the relative
   agent velocities, it adds a new dimension to the control of multi-agent
   systems with several advantages. In particular, we provide a novel
   approach to control the transient dynamics of a network that may
   facilitate the integration of continuous motion planing with discrete
   topology control. The result is verified theoretically and via computer
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-bond known-good-die (KGD) test is necessary to ensure stack yield
   for the future adoption of 3-D integrated circuits. Die wrappers that
   contain boundary registers at the interface between dies have been
   proposed as a solution for KGD test. It has been shown in the literature
   that if gated scan flops (GSFs) are substituted for traditional scan
   flops in the boundary register, then both pre-bond through-silicon-via
   (TSV) and pre-bond scan test can be performed. The drawback of die
   wrappers is that two clocked stages are added to each path that crosses
   a die boundary. In this paper, a bypass mode is added to GSFs to avoid
   the extra clock stages and retiming is used to recover the additional
   delay added to TSV paths by design-for-test insertion. Retiming is
   performed at both die and stack level, and a logic redistribution is
   proposed to improve the results of die-level retiming. The proposed
   methods are evaluated through simulations using two logic-on-logic 3-D
   benchmarks and one modular processor partitioned between two dies.
   Results show that in most cases, retiming at both the die-level and
   stack-level is sufficient for recovering the delay added by wrapper
   boundary cells in cores where all logic and dies are unfixed. Stuck-at
   ATPG is performed to demonstrate that wrapper insertion and retiming
   have little impact on pattern count. The area overhead due to wrapper
   insertion is shown to increase as a circuit is partitioned across an
   increasing number of stack layers, but the area overhead can be reduced
   using retiming.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a preconditioned Bayesian regression method that enables
   sparse polynomial chaos representations of noisy outputs for stochastic
   chemical systems with uncertain reaction rates. The approach is based on
   the definition of an appropriate multiscale transformation of the state
   variables coupled with a Bayesian regression formalism. This enables
   efficient and robust recovery of both the transient dynamics and the
   corresponding noise levels. Implementation of the present approach is
   illustrated through applications to a stochastic Michaelis-Menten
   dynamics and a higher dimensional example involving a genetic positive
   feedback loop. In all cases, a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) is
   used to compute the system dynamics. Numerical experiments show that
   Bayesian preconditioning algorithms can simultaneously accommodate large
   noise levels and large variability with uncertain parameters, and that
   robust estimates can be obtained with a small number of SSA
   realizations.}},

Abstract = {{Continuation methods are used to examine the static and dynamic
   postbuckled behavior of a uniaxially loaded, simply supported plate.
   Continuation methods have been extensively used to study problems in
   mathematics and physics; however, they have not been as widely applied
   to problems in engineering. When paired with a Galerkin approximation,
   continuation methods are shown to be well suited to solving nonlinear
   buckling problems. In addition to providing a robust solution method for
   nonlinear equations, the linearized Jacobians from the continuation
   steps will contain natural frequency and mode shape information for
   mechanical systems (provided inertia terms are included). Results for
   the primary buckling branch are compared to previously published
   results. Using the open-source continuation package AUTO, stable, remote
   secondary buckling branches were discovered. These secondary stable
   equilibrium persist even in the presence of geometric imperfections and
   their existence is confirmed by experiment.}},

Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{B}},
Pages = {{253-260}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Adaptive beamformers will degrade in the presence of model mismatch.
   Because a wider beamwidth has higher ability against steering vector
   errors, and lower sidelobe levels can improve the robustness against
   fast moving interferences, in this work an iterative fast Fourier
   transform (FFT) based adaptive beamformer is proposed with constraints
   on beamwidth and peak sidelobe level. The adaptive beamforming is
   transformed to a weighted pattern synthesis problem. This weighted
   pattern is a product of the array pattern and a weighting function.
   Because the weighting function has shape peaks at the direction of
   interferences, it will have nulls in the array pattern at the directions
   of interferences by reducing the peak sidelobe level of this weighted
   pattern. A modified iterative FFT algorithm is proposed to synthesize
   this weighted pattern. Thanks to the efficiency of FFT, the nonconvex
   problem of power pattern synthesis can be solved efficiently. This
   method is demonstrated through several simulation examples. The results
   show the advantages of the proposed method in obtaining high output
   SINRs against moving target signals and steering vector errors. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a powerful and rapidly maturing
   technology for subsurface threat identification. However, sophisticated
   processing of GPR data is necessary to reduce false alarms due to
   naturally occurring subsurface clutter and soil distortions. Most
   currently fielded GPR-based landmine detection algorithms utilize
   feature extraction and statistical learning to develop robust
   classifiers capable of discriminating buried threats from inert
   subsurface structures. Analysis of these techniques indicates strong
   underlying similarities between efficient landmine detection algorithms
   and modern techniques for feature extraction in the computer vision
   literature. This paper explores the relationship between and application
   of one modern computer vision feature extraction technique, namely
   histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), to landmine detection in GPR
   data. The results presented indicate that HOG features provide a robust
   tool for target identification for both classification and prescreening
   and suggest that other techniques from computer vision might also be
   successfully applied to target detection in GPR data.}},

Abstract = {{In the ongoing search for ever-brighter surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) nanoprobes, gold nanostars (AuNSs) have emerged as one
   of the best geometries for producing SERS in a nonaggregated state.
   Despite their high enhancement factor, optical extinction from
   plasmon-matched nanoparticles can greatly attenuate the overall SERS
   intensity. Herein, we report the development of a new hybrid bimetallic
   NS-based platform that exhibits superior resonant SERS (SERRS)
   properties. In this new nanoplatform, coating AuNSs with a subtotal
   layer of silver (AuNS@Ag) can further increase their SERRS brightness by
   an order of magnitude when being interrogated by an off-resonant
   excitation source. Silica-encapsulated AuNS@Ag nanoprobes were injected
   intradermally into a rat pelt, where SERRS was readily detected with
   higher signal-to-noise than nanoprobes prepared from AuNS. Moreover,
   these off-resonance AuNS@Ag nanoprobes did not cause any gross
   photothermal damage to tissue, which was observed with the
   plasmon-matched AuNSs. This novel SERRS-active hybrid nanoprobe exhibits
   high SERRS brightness and offers I promising properties for future
   applications in sensing and molecular imaging.}},

   Semiconductors via High-Throughput Materials Modeling}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{The lattice thermal conductivity (kappa(omega)) is a key property for
   many potential applications of compounds. Discovery of materials with
   very low or high kappa(omega) remains an experimental challenge due to
   high costs and time-consuming synthesis procedures. High-throughput
   computational prescreening is a valuable approach for significantly
   reducing the set of candidate compounds. In this article, we introduce
   efficient methods for reliably estimating the bulk kappa(omega) for a
   large number of compounds. The algorithms are based on a combination of
   machine-learning algorithms, physical insights, and automatic ab initio
   calculations. We scanned approximately 79,000 half-Heusler entries in
   the AFLOWLIB.org database. Among the 450 mechanically stable ordered
   semiconductors identified, we find that kappa(omega) spans more than 2
   orders of magnitude-a much larger range than that previously thought.
   kappa(omega) is lowest for compounds whose elements in equivalent
   positions have large atomic radii. We then perform a thorough screening
   of thermodynamical stability that allows us to reduce the list to 75
   systems. We then provide a quantitative estimate of kappa(omega) for
   this selected range of systems. Three semiconductors having kappa(omega)
   < 5 Wm(-1) K-1 are proposed for further experimental study.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Songbirds use auditory feedback to learn and maintain their songs, but
   how feedback interacts with vocal motor circuitry remains unclear. A
   potential site for this interaction is the song premotor nucleus HVC,
   which receives auditory input and contains neurons (HVCX cells) that
   innervate an anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) important to
   feedback-dependent vocal plasticity. Although the singing-related output
   of HVCX cells is unaltered by distorted auditory feedback (DAF),
   deafening gradually weakens synapses on HVCX cells, raising the
   possibility that they integrate feedback only at subthreshold levels
   during singing. Using intracellular recordings in singing zebra finches,
   we found that DAF failed to perturb singing-related synaptic activity of
   HVCX cells, although many of these cells responded to auditory stimuli
   in non-singing states. Moreover, in vivo multiphoton imaging revealed
   that deafening-induced changes to HVCX synapses require intact AFP
   output. These findings support a model in which the AFP accesses
   feedback independent of HVC.}},

Abstract = {{The practical construction of scalable quantum-computer hardware capable
   of executing nontrivial quantum algorithms will require the
   juxtaposition of different types of quantum systems. We analyze a
   modular ion trap quantum-computer architecture with a hierarchy of
   interactions that can scale to very large numbers of qubits. Local
   entangling quantum gates between qubit memories within a single register
   are accomplished using natural interactions between the qubits, and
   entanglement between separate registers is completed via a probabilistic
   photonic interface between qubits in different registers, even over
   large distances. We show that this architecture can be made fault
   tolerant, and demonstrate its viability for fault-tolerant execution of
   modest size quantum circuits.}},

Title = {{A versatile smart transformation optics device with auxetic
   elasto-electromagnetic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Synergistic integration of electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical
   properties of metamaterials, a concept known as smart metamaterials,
   promises new applications across the spectrum, from flexible waveguides
   to shape-conforming cloaks. These applications became possible thanks to
   smart transformation optics (STO), a design methodology that utilizes
   coordinate transformations to control both EM wave propagation and
   mechanical deformation of the device. Here, we demonstrate several STO
   devices based on extremely auxetic (Poisson ratio -1)
   elasto-electromagnetic metamaterials, both of which exhibit enormous
   flexibility and sustain efficient operation upon a wide range of
   deformations. Spatial maps of microwave electric fields across these
   devices confirm our ability to deform carpet cloaks, bent waveguides,
   and potentially other quasi-conformal TO-based devices operating at 7
   similar to 8 GHz. These devices are each fabricated from a single sheet
   of initially uniform (double-periodic) square-lattice metamaterial,
   which acquires the necessary distribution of effective permittivity
   entirely from the mechanical deformation of its boundary. By integrating
   transformation optics and continuum mechanics theory, we provide
   analytical derivations for the design of STO devices. Additionally, we
   clarify an important point relating to two-dimensional STO devices: the
   difference between plane stress and plane strain assumptions, which lead
   to elastic metamaterials with Poisson ratio -1 and -infinity,
   respectively.}},

   stratified turbulence}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{In stably stratified turbulent flows, the mixing efficiency associated
   with eddy diffusivity for heat, or equivalently the turbulent Prandtl
   number (Pr-t), is fraught with complex dynamics originating from the
   scalewise interplay between shear generation of turbulence and its
   dissipation by density gradients. A large corpus of data and numerical
   simulations agree on a near-universal relation between Pr-t and the
   Richardson number (R-i), which encodes the relative importance of
   buoyancy dissipation to mechanical production of turbulent kinetic
   energy. The Pr-t-R-i relation is shown to be derivable solely from the
   cospectral budgets for momentum and heat fluxes if a Rotta-like return
   to isotropy closure for the pressure-strain effects and Kolmogorov's
   theory for turbulent cascade are invoked. The ratio of the Kolmogorov to
   the Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin phenomenological constants, and a
   constant associated with isotropization of the production whose value (=
   3/5) has been predicted from Rapid Distortion Theory, explain all the
   macroscopic nonlinearities.}},

Title = {{Dual-Energy Micro-CT Functional Imaging of Primary Lung Cancer in Mice
   Using Gold and Iodine Nanoparticle Contrast Agents: A Validation Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To provide additional functional information for tumor
   characterization, we investigated the use of dual-energy computed
   tomography for imaging murine lung tumors. Tumor blood volume and
   vascular permeability were quantified using gold and iodine
   nanoparticles. This approach was compared with a single contrast
   agent/single-energy CT method. Ex vivo validation studies were performed
   to demonstrate the accuracy of in vivo contrast agent quantification by
   CT.
   Methods: Primary lung tumors were generated in LSL-Kras(G12D);p53(FL/FL)
   mice. Gold nanoparticles were injected, followed by iodine nanoparticles
   two days later. The gold accumulated in tumors, while the iodine
   provided intravascular contrast. Three dual-energy CT scans were
   performed-two for the single contrast agent method and one for the dual
   contrast agent method. Gold and iodine concentrations in each scan were
   calculated using a dual-energy decomposition. For each method, the tumor
   fractional blood volume was calculated based on iodine concentration,
   and tumor vascular permeability was estimated based on accumulated gold
   concentration. For validation, the CT-derived measurements were compared
   with histology and inductively-coupled plasma optical emission
   spectroscopy measurements of gold concentrations in tissues.
   Results: Dual-energy CT enabled in vivo separation of gold and iodine
   contrast agents and showed uptake of gold nanoparticles in the spleen,
   liver, and tumors. The tumor fractional blood volume measurements
   determined from the two imaging methods were in agreement, and a high
   correlation (R-2 = 0.81) was found between measured fractional blood
   volume and histology-derived microvascular density. Vascular
   permeability measurements obtained from the two imaging methods agreed
   well with ex vivo measurements.
   Conclusions: Dual-energy CT using two types of nanoparticles is
   equivalent to the single nanoparticle method, but allows for measurement
   of fractional blood volume and permeability with a single scan. As
   confirmed by ex vivo methods, CT-derived nanoparticle concentrations are
   accurate. This method could play an important role in lung tumor
   characterization by CT.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major constituents of the synovial fluid that is thought to
   be responsible for chondroprotection and boundary lubrication is the
   glycoprotein lubricin (PRG4); however, the molecular mechanisms by which
   lubricin carries out its critical functions still remain largely
   unknown. We hypothesized that the interaction of lubricin with type II
   collagen, the main component of the cartilage extracellular matrix,
   results in enhanced tribological and wear properties. In this study, we
   examined: (i) the molecular details by which lubricin interacts with
   type II collagen and how binding is related to boundary lubrication and
   adhesive interactions; and (ii) whether collagen structure can affect
   lubricin adsorption and its chondroprotective properties. We found that
   lubricin adsorbs strongly onto denatured, amorphous, and fibrillar
   collagen surfaces. Furthermore, we found large repulsive interactions
   between the collagen surfaces in presence of lubricin, which increased
   with increasing lubricin concentration. Lubricin attenuated the large
   friction and also the long-range adhesion between fibrillar collagen
   surfaces. Interestingly, lubricin adsorbed onto and mediated the
   frictional response between the denatured and native amorphous collagen
   surfaces equally and showed no preference on the supramolecular
   architecture of collagen. However, the coefficient of friction was
   lowest on fibrillar collagen in the presence of lubricin. We speculate
   that an important role of lubricin in mediating interactions at the
   cartilage surface is to attach to the cartilage surface and provide a
   protective coating that maintains the contacting surfaces in a
   sterically repulsive state. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Land application accounts for similar to 50\% of wastewater solid
   disposal in the United States. Still, little is known regarding the
   ecological impacts of nonregulated contaminants found in biosolids.
   Because of the myriad of contaminants, there is a need for a rapid,
   high-throughput method to evaluate their ecotoxicity. Herein, we
   developed a novel assay that measures denitrification inhibition in a
   model denitrifier, Paracoccus denitrificans Pd1222. Two common
   (triclosan and triclocarban) and four emerging (2,4,5 trichlorophenol,
   2-benzyl-4-chlorophenol, 2-chloro-4-phenylphenol, and
   bis(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)methane) antimicrobial agents found in
   biosolids were analyzed. Overall, the assay was reproducible and
   measured impacts on denitrification over 3 orders of magnitude exposure.
   The lowest observable adverse effect concentrations (LOAECs) were 1.04
   mu M for triclosan, 3.17 mu M for triclocarban, 0.372 mu M for
   bis-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)methane, 4.89 mu M for 2-chloro-4-phenyl
   phenol, 45.7 mu M for 2-benzyl-4-chorophenol, and 50.6 mu M for
   2,4,5-trichlorophenol. Compared with gene expression and cell viability
   based methods, the denitrification assay was more sensitive and resulted
   in lower LOAECs. The increased sensitivity, low cost, and
   high-throughput adaptability make this method an attractive alternative
   for meeting the initial testing regulatory framework for the Federal
   Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and recommended for the
   Toxic Substances Control Act, in determining the ecotoxicity of
   biosolids-derived emerging contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of SWCNTs in complex matrices presents a unique challenge as
   common techniques lack spatial resolution and specificity. Near infrared
   fluorescence (NIRF) has emerged as a valuable tool for detecting and
   quantifying SWCNTs in environmental samples by exploiting their innate
   fluorescent properties. The objective of this study was to optimize
   NIRF-based imaging and quantitation methods for tracking and quantifying
   SWCNTs in an aquatic vertebrate model in conjunction with assessing
   toxicological end points. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were
   exposed by single gavage to SWCNTs and their distribution was tracked
   using a custom NIRF imaging system for 7 days. No overt toxicity was
   observed in any of the SWCNT treated fish; however, histopathology
   observations from gastrointestinal (GI) tissue revealed edema within the
   submucosa and altered mucous cell morphology. NIRF images showed strong
   SWCNT-derived fluorescence signals in whole fish and excised intestinal
   tissues. Fluorescence was not detected in other tissues examined,
   indicating that no appreciable intestinal absorption occurred. SWCNTs
   were quantified in intestinal tissues using a NIRF spectroscopic method
   revealing values that were consistent with the pattern of fluorescence
   observed with NIRF imaging. Results of this work demonstrate the utility
   of NIRF imaging as a valuable tool for examining uptake and distribution
   of SWCNTs in aquatic vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Pipeline safety in the United States has increased in recent decades,
   but incidents involving natural gas pipelines still cause an average of
   17 fatalities and \$133 M in property damage annually. Natural gas leaks
   are also the largest anthropogenic source of the greenhouse gas methane
   (CH4) in the U.S. To reduce pipeline leakage and increase consumer
   safety, we deployed a Picarro G2301 Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer in a
   car, mapping 5893 natural gas leaks (2.5 to 88.6 ppm CH4) across 1500
   road miles of Washington, DC. The delta C-13-isotopic signatures of the
   methane (-38.2 parts per thousand +/- 3.9 parts per thousand s.d.) and
   ethane (-36.5 +/- 1.1 s.d.) and the CH4:C2H6 ratios (25.5 +/- 8.9 s.d.)
   closely matched the pipeline gas (-39.0 parts per thousand and -36.2
   parts per thousand for methane and ethane; 19.0 for CH4/C2H6). Emissions
   from four street leaks ranged from 9200 to 38 200 L CH4 day(-1) each,
   comparable to natural gas used by 1.7 to 7.0 homes, respectively. At 19
   tested locations, 12 potentially explosive (Grade 1) methane
   concentrations of 50 000 to 500 000 ppm were detected in manholes.
   Financial incentives and targeted programs among companies, public
   utility commissions, and scientists to reduce leaks and replace old
   cast-iron pipes will improve consumer safety and air quality, save
   money, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal is necessary for spread into new habitats, but it has also
   been shown to inhibit spread. Theoretical studies have suggested that
   the presence of a strong Allee effect may account for these
   counterintuitive observations. Experimental demonstration of this notion
   is lacking due to the difficulty in quantitative analysis of such
   phenomena in a natural setting. We engineered Escherichia coli to
   exhibit a strong Allee effect and examined how the Allee effect would
   affect the spread of the engineered bacteria. We showed that the Allee
   effect led to a biphasic dependence of bacterial spread on the dispersal
   rate: spread is promoted for intermediate dispersal rates but inhibited
   at low or high dispersal rates. The shape of this dependence is
   contingent upon the initial density of the source population. Moreover,
   the Allee effect led to a trade-off between effectiveness of population
   spread and survival: increasing the number of target patches during
   dispersal allows more effective spread, but it simultaneously increases
   the risk of failing to invade or of going extinct. We also observed that
   total population growth is transiently maximized at an intermediate
   number of target patches. Finally, we demonstrate that fluctuations in
   cell growth may contribute to the paradoxical relationship between
   dispersal and spread. Our results provide direct experimental evidence
   that the Allee effect can explain the apparently paradoxical effects of
   dispersal on spread and have implications for guiding the spread of
   cooperative organisms.}},

   paper. Results for the buckled, limit cycle oscillation, and chaotic
   responses of the simply supported plate are presented and compared with
   the Galerkin solutions. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proper
   orthogonal decomposition reduced-order model permits a much
   lower-dimensional model as compared to that obtainable via the Galerkin
   approach. For example, for a plate length-to-width ratio equal to 4,
   only two proper orthogonal decomposition modes are required to describe
   the panel oscillation with good accuracy. This produces a reduction in
   the computational time to less than 3 s in comparison with almost 900 s
   when using the 16 modes required to obtain the same accuracy with the
   Galerkin approach.}},

Abstract = {{Author Summary
   Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is known to be important for
   embryogenesis, tissue homoeostasis, and cancer treatment. Furthermore,
   researchers have recently observed that apoptosis may promote wound
   healing and tissue regeneration, and accelerate undesired solid tumor
   regrowth after chemotherapy/radiation therapy. Mechanisms of
   apoptosis-induced tissue regrowth are related to a molecular network
   discovered recently in our lab. To quantitatively understand the
   kinetics of interactions of different molecules in this network, we
   developed a mathematical model and validated it by comparing the
   simulation results to experimental data reported in previous studies. To
   gain new insights into the process of tissue regrowth after inducing
   apoptosis, we used the model to simulate the effects of radiation on the
   production of a key growth stimulating factor, PGE2, in apoptotic cells.
   Additionally, we simulated how PGE2 production could be altered when
   cells were treated with different inhibitors. We expect that the new
   mathematical model can be used in future studies to facilitate design of
   better approaches to cancer treatment or normal tissue regeneration.
   Apoptosis is a tightly controlled process in mammalian cells. It is
   important for embryogenesis, tissue homoeostasis, and cancer treatment.
   Apoptosis not only induces cell death, but also leads to the release of
   signals that promote rapid proliferation of surrounding cells through
   the Phoenix Rising (PR) pathway. To quantitatively understand the
   kinetics of interactions of different molecules in this pathway, we
   developed a mathematical model to simulate the effects of various
   changes in the PR pathway on the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a
   key factor for promoting cell proliferation. These changes include
   activation of caspase 3 (C3), caspase 7 (C7), and nuclear factor kappa B
   (NF kappa B). In addition, we simulated the effects of cyclooxygenase-2
   (COX2) inhibition and C3 knockout on the level of secreted PGE2. The
   model predictions on PGE2 in MEF and 4T1 cells at 48 hours after 10-Gray
   radiation were quantitatively consistent with the experimental data in
   the literature. Compared to C7, the model predicted that C3 activation
   was more critical for PGE2 production. The model also predicted that
   PGE2 production could be significantly reduced when COX2 expression was
   blocked via either NF kappa B inactivation or treatment of cells with
   exogenous COX2 inhibitors, which led to a decrease in the rate of
   conversion from arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 in the PR pathway.
   In conclusion, the mathematical model developed in this study yielded
   new insights into the process of tissue regrowth stimulated by signals
   from apoptotic cells. In future studies, the model can be used for
   experimental data analysis and assisting development of novel
   strategies/drugs for improving cancer treatment or normal tissue
   regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for movement
   disorders, but the fundamental mechanisms by which DBS has its effects
   remain unknown. Computational models can provide insights into the
   mechanisms of DBS, but to be useful, the models must have sufficient
   detail to predict accurately the electric fields produced by DBS. We
   used a finite-element method model of the Medtronic 3387 electrode
   array, coupled to cable models of myelinated axons, to quantify how
   interpolation errors, electrode geometry, and the electrode-tissue
   interface affect calculation of electrical potentials and stimulation
   thresholds for populations of model nerve fibers. Convergence of the
   potentials was not a sufficient criterion for ensuring the same degree
   of accuracy in subsequent determination of stimulation thresholds,
   because the accuracy of the stimulation thresholds depended on the order
   of the elements. Simplifying the 3387 electrode array by ignoring the
   inactive contacts and extending the terminated end of the shaft had
   position-dependent effects on the potentials and excitation thresholds,
   and these simplifications may impact correlations between DBS parameters
   and clinical outcomes. When the current density in the bulk tissue is
   uniform, the effect of the electrode-tissue interface impedance could be
   approximated by filtering the potentials calculated with a static lumped
   electrical equivalent circuit. Further, for typical DBS parameters
   during voltage-regulated stimulation, it was valid to approximate the
   electrode as an ideal polarized electrode with a nonlinear capacitance.
   Validation of these computational considerations enables accurate
   modeling of the electric field produced by DBS.}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal hysteresis between evapotranspiration (ET) and vapor pressure
   deficit (VPD) was reported in many ecosystems, but justification for its
   onset and magnitude remains incomplete with biotic and abiotic factors
   invoked as possible explanations. To place these explanations within a
   holistic framework, the occurrence of hysteresis was theoretically
   assessed along a hierarchy of model systems where both abiotic and
   biotic components are sequentially added. Lysimeter evaporation (E)
   measurements and model calculations using the Penman equation were used
   to investigate the effect of the time lag between net radiation and VPD
   on the hysteresis in the absence of any biotic effects. Modulations from
   biotic effects on the ET-VPD hysteresis were then added using
   soil-plant-atmosphere models of different complexities applied to a
   grassland ecosystem. The results suggest that the hysteresis magnitude
   depends on the radiation-VPD lag, while the plant and soil water
   potentials are both key factors modulating the hysteretic ET-VPD
   relation as soil moisture declines. In particular, larger hysteresis
   magnitude is achieved at less negative leaf water potential, root water
   potential, and soil water potential. While plant hydraulic capacitance
   affects the leaf water potential-ET relation, it has negligible effects
   on the ET-VPD hysteresis. Therefore, the genesis and magnitude of the
   ET-VPD hysteresis are controlled directly by both abiotic factors such
   as soil water availability, biotic factors (leaf and root water
   potentials, which in turn depend on soil moisture), and the time lag
   between radiation and VPD.

Abstract = {{Unidirectional devices that pass acoustic energy in only one direction

   significant attention. However, for most practical applications that
   require unidirectionality at audio and low frequencies, sub-wavelength
   implementations capable of the necessary time-reversal symmetry breaking
   remain elusive. Here we describe a design approach based on metamaterial
   techniques that provides highly subwavelength and strongly
   non-reciprocal devices. We demonstrate this approach by designing and
   experimentally characterizing a non-reciprocal active acoustic
   metamaterial unit cell composed of a single piezoelectric membrane
   augmented by a non-linear electronic circuit, and sandwiched between
   Helmholtz cavities tuned to different frequencies. The design is thinner
   than a tenth of a wavelength, yet it has an isolation factor of 410 dB.
   The design method generates relatively broadband unidirectional devices

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public health problem, on
   pace to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020.
   Moreover, emerging evidence linking repeated mild traumatic brain injury
   to long-term neurodegenerative disorders points out that TBI can be both
   an acute disorder and a chronic disease. We are at an important
   transition point in our understanding of TBI, as past work has generated
   significant advances in better protecting us against some forms of
   moderate and severe TBI. However, we still lack a clear understanding of
   how to study milder forms of injury, such as concussion, or new forms of
   TBI that can occur from primary blast loading. In this review, we
   highlight the major advances made in understanding the biomechanical
   basis of TBI. We point out opportunities to generate significant new
   advances in our understanding of TBI biomechanics, especially as it
   appears across the molecular, cellular, and whole organ scale.}},

Abstract = {{Specialization of datacenter resources brings performance and energy
   improvements in response to the growing scale and diversity of cloud
   applications. Yet heterogeneous hardware adds complexity and volatility
   to latency-sensitive applications. A resource allocation mechanism that
   leverages architectural principles can overcome both of these obstacles.
   We integrate research in heterogeneous architectures with recent
   advances in multi-agent systems. Embedding architectural insight into
   proxies that bid on behalf of applications, a market effectively
   allocates hardware to applications with diverse preferences and
   valuations. Exploring a space of heterogeneous datacenter
   configurations, which mix server-class Xeon and mobile-class Atom
   processors, we find an optimal heterogeneous balance that improves both
   welfare and energy-efficiency. We further design and evaluate twelve
   design points along the Xeon-to-Atom spectrum, and find that a mix of
   three processor architectures achieves a 12x reduction in response time
   violations relative to equal-power homogeneous systems.}},

Abstract = {{Conditions under which skeletal myoblasts are cultured in vitro are
   critical to growth and differentiation of these cells into mature
   skeletal myofibers. We examined several culture conditions that promoted
   human skeletal myoblast (HSkM) culture and examined the effect of
   microRNAs and mechanical stimulation on differentiation. Culture
   conditions for HSkM are different from those that enable rapid C2C12
   myoblast differentiation. Culture on a growth factor-reduced Matrigel
   (GFR-MG)-coated surface in 2\% equine serum-supplemented differentiation
   medium to promote HSkM differentiation under static conditions was
   compared with culture conditions used for C2C12 cell differentiation.
   Such conditions led to a >20-fold increase in myogenic miR-1, miR-133a,
   and miR-206 expression, a >2-fold increase in myogenic transcription
   factor Mef-2C expression, and an increase in sarcomeric alpha-actinin
   protein. Imposing +/- 10\% cyclic stretch at 0.5 Hz for 1 h followed by
   5 h of rest over 2 wk produced a >20\% increase in miR-1, miR-133a, and
   miR-206 expression in 8\% equine serum and a >35\% decrease in 2\%
   equine serum relative to static conditions. HSkM differentiation was
   accelerated in vitro by inhibition of proliferation-promoting miR-133a:
   immunofluorescence for sarcomeric alpha-actinin exhibited accelerated
   development of striations compared with the corresponding negative
   control, and Western blotting showed 30\% more alpha-actinin at day 6
   postdifferentiation. This study showed that 100 mu g/ml GFR-MG coating
   and 2\% equine serum-supplemented differentiation medium enhanced HSkM
   differentiation and myogenic miR expression and that addition of
   antisense miR-133a alone can accelerate primary human skeletal muscle
   differentiation in vitro.}},

Title = {{Separating viscoelasticity and poroelasticity of gels with different
   length and time scales}},
Journal = {{ACTA MECHANICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{20-27}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Viscoelasticity and poroelasticity commonly coexist as time-dependent
   behaviors in polymer gels. Engineering applications often require
   knowledge of both behaviors separated; however, few methods exist to
   decouple viscoelastic and poroelastic properties of gels. We propose a
   method capable of separating viscoelasticity and poroelasticity of gels
   in various mechanical tests. The viscoelastic characteristic time and
   the poroelastic diffusivity of a gel define an intrinsic material length
   scale of the gel. The experimental setup gives a sample length scale,
   over which the solvent migrates in the gel. By setting the sample length
   to be much larger or smaller than the material length, the
   viscoelasticity and poroelasticity of the gel will dominate at different
   time scales in a test. Therefore, the viscoelastic and poroelastic
   properties of the gel can be probed separately at different time scales
   of the test. We further validate the method by finite-element models and
   stress-relaxation experiments.}},

Title = {{Circumferential Tensile Stiffness of Glaucomatous Trabecular Meshwork}},
Journal = {{INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY \& VISUAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{814-823}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Our previous work indicated that a larger circumferential
   Young's modulus (E) of trabecular meshwork (TM) correlated with a higher
   outflow facility (C) in normal human donor eyes. The current study
   investigated the influence of glaucomatous TM stiffness and cellularity
   on C.
   METHODS. Eight left eyes from glaucomatous human donors were perfused
   within 48 hours post mortem. Values of C were determined at pressures of
   10, 20, 30, and 40 mm Hg. The TM was then dissected and imaged with
   optical coherence tomography to determine its cross-sectional area.
   Uniaxial tensile stress was applied longitudinally to TM segments to
   determine stress-strain curves. E was calculated at zero strain,
   representing the circumferential stiffness of the TM at a relaxed state.
   Confocal images of DAPI-stained TM segments were used to determine
   cellularity after mechanical stretching.
   RESULTS. C (mu L/min/mm Hg) of glaucomatous eyes was 0.18 +/- 0.02 (mean
   +/- SE) at 10 mm Hg and decreased to 0.11 +/- 0.02 when the pressure was
   increased to 40 mm Hg. C measured at 30 and 40 mm Hg correlated with TM
   cellularity. E was 12.5 MPa and 1.4 (geometric mean and SE) and did not
   statistically correlate with postmortem time, age, C, or cellularity.
   CONCLUSIONS. Compared with data of normal eyes observed in a previous
   study, C in glaucomatous eyes was reduced significantly, and the amount
   of reduction increased with increasing the pressure. E of glaucomatous
   TM was approximately one-fifth that of normal TM. Prospective studies
   are needed to further investigate the influence of TM tensile stiffness
   on outflow regulation.}},

Title = {{Measuring long-lived C-13(2) state lifetimes at natural abundance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{239}},
Pages = {{81-86}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Long-lived disconnected eigenstates (for example, the singlet state in a
   system with two nearly equivalent carbons, or the singlet-singlet state
   in a system with two chemically equivalent carbons and two chemically
   equivalent hydrogens) hold the potential to drastically extend the
   lifetime of hyperpolarization in molecular tracers for in vivo magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI). However, a first-principles calculation of the
   expected lifetime (and thus selection of potential imaging agents) is
   made very difficult because of the large variety of relevant intra- and
   intermolecular relaxation mechanisms. As a result, all previous
   measurements relied on costly and time consuming syntheses of C-13
   labeled compounds. Here we show that it is possible to determine C-13
   singlet state lifetimes by detecting the naturally abundant
   doubly-labeled species. This approach allows for rapid and low cost
   screening of potential molecular biomarkers bearing long-lived states.

Abstract = {{The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) have both been implicated in the cognitive control of saccadic eye
   movements by single neuron recording studies in nonhuman primates and
   functional imaging studies in humans, but their relative roles remain
   unclear. Here, we reversibly deactivated either dlPFC or ACC subregions
   in macaque monkeys while the animals performed randomly interleaved pro-
   and antisaccades. In addition, we explored the whole-brain functional
   connectivity of these two regions by applying a seed-based resting-state
   functional MRI analysis in a separate cohort of monkeys. We found that
   unilateral dlPFC deactivation had stronger behavioral effects on
   saccades than unilateral ACC deactivation, and that the dlPFC displayed
   stronger functional connectivity with frontoparietal areas than the ACC.
   We suggest that the dlPFC plays a more prominent role in the preparation
   of pro- and antisaccades than the ACC.}},

Abstract = {{The use of high-resolution imaging methods in scanning transmission
   electron microscopy (STEM) is limited in many cases by the sensitivity
   of the sample to the beam and the onset of electron beam damage (for
   example, in the study of organic systems, in tomography and during in
   situ experiments). To demonstrate that alternative strategies for image
   acquisition can help alleviate this beam damage issue, here we apply
   compressive sensing via Bayesian dictionary learning to high-resolution
   STEM images. These computational algorithms have been applied to a set
   of images with a reduced number of sampled pixels in the image. For a
   reduction in the number of pixels down to 5\% of the original image, the
   algorithms can recover the original image from the reduced data set. We
   show that this approach is valid for both atomic-resolution images and
   nanometer-resolution studies, such as those that might be used in
   tomography datasets, by applying the method to images of strontium
   titanate and zeolites. As STEM images are acquired pixel by pixel while
   the beam is scanned over the surface of the sample, these
   postacquisition manipulations of the images can, in principle, be
   directly implemented as a low-dose acquisition method with no change in
   the electron optics or the alignment of the microscope itself.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Previously, the matrix pencil method (MPM) and the forward-backward MPM
   (FBMPM) were used to effectively reduce the number of antenna elements
   in the single-pattern linear arrays. This work extends the MPM and
   FBMPM-based synthesis methods to the synthesis of multiple-pattern
   linear arrays with a smaller number of elements. The extended MPM
   (resp., the extended FBMPM) method organizes all the multiple pattern
   data into a composite Hankel (resp., composite Hankel-Toeplitz) matrix
   from which the minimum number of elements and the common poles
   corresponding to element positions can be obtained with similar
   processing used in the original MPM or FBMPM synthesis method. In
   particular, the extended FBMPM inherits the advantage of the original
   FBMPM that a useful restriction is put on the distribution of poles,
   which makes the element positions obtained much more accurate and
   robust. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the
   effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods. For the tested
   cases, the element saving is about 20\% similar to 25\% for
   reconfigurable shaped patterns, and can be even more for electrically
   large linear arrays with scanned pencil-beams.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we present an innovative imaging technology for breast cancer
   using gamma-ray stimulated spectroscopy based on the nuclear resonance
   fluorescence (NRF) technique. In NRF, a nucleus of a given isotope
   selectively absorbs gamma rays with energy exactly equal to one of its
   quantized energy states, emitting an outgoing gamma ray with energy
   nearly identical to that of the incident gamma ray. Due to its
   application of NRF, gamma-ray stimulated spectroscopy is sensitive to
   trace element concentration changes, which are suspected to occur at
   early stages of breast cancer, and therefore can be potentially used to
   noninvasively detect and diagnose cancer in its early stages. Using
   Monte-Carlo simulations, we have designed and demonstrated an imaging
   system that uses gamma-ray stimulated spectroscopy for visualizing
   breast cancer. We show that gamma-ray stimulated spectroscopy is able to
   visualize breast cancer lesions based primarily on the differences in
   the concentrations of trace elements between diseased and healthy
   tissue, rather than differences in density that are crucial for X-ray
   mammography. The technique shows potential for early breast cancer
   detection; however, improvements are needed in gamma-ray laser
   technology for the technique to become a clinically feasible method of
   detecting and diagnosing cancer at early stages.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Accurate measurements of choroidal thickness (CT) using
   enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) require a
   well-defined choroid-scleral junction (CSJ), which may appear in some
   eyes as a hyporeflective band corresponding to the suprachoroidal layer
   (SCL).
   OBJECTIVE To identify factors associated with the presence and thickness
   of the SCL in healthy participants and determine how different CSJ
   boundary definitions impact CT measurements.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Secondary analysis of EDI-OCT images
   obtained prospectively from 74 eyes of 74 controls (mean age, 68.6
   years) from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Ancillary SDOCT Study.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The CSJ appearances were categorized as
   either having no visible SCL or a hyporeflective band corresponding to
   the SCL. Ocular parameters associated with the presence and thickness of
   the SCL were identified. Subfoveal CT was measured using 3 different
   posterior boundaries: (1) the posterior vessel border (vascular CT
   {[}VCT]), (2) inner border of the SCL (stromal CT {[}StCT]), and (3)
   inner border of the sclera (total CT {[}TCT]). Manual segmentation using
   custom software was used to compare VCT, StCT, and TCT across the
   macula.
   RESULTS The SCL was visible in 33 eyes (44.6\%). Factors associated with
   SCL presence and thickness included hyperopic refractive error (R-2 =
   0.123; P = .045) and increased TCT (R-2 = 0.215; P = .004), but not age,
   visual acuity, intraocular pressure, retinal foveal thickness, VCT, or
   StCT. In eyes where the SCL was not visible, mean {[}SD] subfoveal VCT
   was 222.3 {[}101.5] mu m and StCT and TCT were 240.0 {[}99.0] mu m, with
   a difference of 17.7 {[}16.0] mu m (P < .001). In eyes where the SCL was
   visible, mean {[}SD] subfoveal VCT, StCT, and TCT were 221.9 {[}83.1] mu
   m, 257.7 {[}97.3] mu m, and 294.1 {[}104.8] mu m, respectively, with the
   greatest difference of 72.2 {[}30.4] mu m between VCT and TCT (P <
   .001). All 3 CT measurements were significantly different along all
   points up to 3.0 mm nasal and temporal to the fovea.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A hyporeflective SCL is visible at the CSJ on
   EDI-OCT in nearly half of healthy individuals, and its presence
   correlates with hyperopia. Different posterior boundary definitions may
   result in significant differences in CT measurements and should be
   explicitly identified in future choroidal studies and segmentation
   algorithms.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Given the radiation concerns inherent to the x-ray modalities,
   accurately estimating the radiation doses that patients receive during
   different imaging modalities is crucial. This study estimated organ
   doses, effective doses, and risk indices for the three clinical chest
   x-ray imaging techniques (chest radiography, tomosynthesis, and CT)
   using 59 anatomically variable voxelized phantoms and Monte Carlo
   simulation methods.
   Methods: A total of 59 computational anthropomorphic male and female
   extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) adult phantoms were used in this study.
   Organ doses and effective doses were estimated for a clinical
   radiography system with the capability of conducting chest radiography
   and tomosynthesis (Definium 8000, VolumeRAD, GE Healthcare) and a
   clinical CT system (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare). A Monte Carlo dose
   simulation program (PENELOPE, version 2006, Universitat de Barcelona,
   Spain) was used to mimic these two clinical systems. The Duke University
   (Durham, NC) technique charts were used to determine the clinical
   techniques for the radiographic modalities. An exponential relationship
   between CTDIvol and patient diameter was used to determine the absolute
   dose values for CT. The simulations of the two clinical systems compute
   organ and tissue doses, which were then used to calculate effective dose
   and risk index. The calculation of the two dose metrics used the tissue
   weighting factors from ICRP Publication 103 and BEIR VII report.
   Results: The average effective dose of the chest posteroanterior
   examination was found to be 0.04 mSv, which was 1.3\% that of the chest
   CT examination. The average effective dose of the chest tomosynthesis
   examination was found to be about ten times that of the chest
   posteroanterior examination and about 12\% that of the chest CT
   examination. With increasing patient average chest diameter, both the
   effective dose and risk index for CT increased considerably in an
   exponential fashion, while these two dose metrics only increased
   slightly for radiographic modalities and for chest tomosynthesis.
   Effective and organ doses normalized to mAs all illustrated an
   exponential decrease with increasing patient size. As a surface organ,
   breast doses had less correlation with body size than that of lungs or
   liver.
   Conclusions: Patient body size has a much greater impact on radiation
   dose of chest CT examinations than chest radiography and tomosynthesis.
   The size of a patient should be considered when choosing the best
   thoracic imaging modality. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are the primary candidates
   to receive small-diameter tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs).
   Peripheral blood derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from CAD
   patients (CAD EPCs) represent a minimally invasive source of autologous
   cells for TEBV endothelialization. We have previously shown that human
   CAD EPCs are highly proliferative and express many of the hallmarks of
   mature and healthy endothelial cells; however, their behavior on stromal
   cells that comprise the media of TEBVs has not yet been evaluated.
   Primary CAD EPCs or control human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were
   seeded over confluent, quiescent layers of human smooth muscle cells
   (SMCs) using a direct co-culture model. The percent coverage, adhesion
   strength, alignment under flow and generation of flow-induced nitric
   oxide of the seeded CAD EPCs were compared to that of HAECs. The
   integrin-binding profile of CAD EPCs was also evaluated over a layer of
   confluent, quiescent SMCs. Direct comparison of our CAD EPC results to
   analogous co-culture studies with cord blood EPCs show that both types
   of blood-derived EPCs are viable options for endothelialization of
   TEBVs. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Electrogenesis in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is a promising approach to
   extract useful energy from sewage sludge. However, its impact on
   ultimate sludge disposal (e.g., incineration) has not been well
   evaluated. In the present work, thermogravimetry and differential
   scanning calorimetry were carried out to investigate the combustion
   efficiency of recovered organic matter (ROM) and waste activated sludge
   (WAS) in the electrogenesis process. In order to reduce the
   dimensionality of thermograms and to identify the predominant reactions,
   principal component analysis (PCA) was used for data processing. Two
   principal components (PC1 and PC2) were extracted from the derivative
   thermogravimetry, including three exothermic reactions associated with
   terrestrial organic matter, metabolic products, and acetylated
   substances. The variation of thermal kinetic characteristics revealed
   that energy densities of ROM and WAS were decreased after
   electrogenesis, and the thermograms shifted towards higher reaction
   temperatures, suggesting that electrogenesis might reduce the combustion
   efficiency of sewage sludge. Although no power was produced in
   open-circuit MFCs, more than 20\% of the energy content of ROM and WAS
   was lost during the fermentation process, indicating that low Coulombic
   efficiency is inevitable in the treatment of sewage sludge with MFCs.

Abstract = {{Accurate quantification of retinal layer thicknesses in mice as seen on
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) is crucial for the study of numerous
   ocular and neurological diseases. However, manual segmentation is
   time-consuming and subjective. Previous attempts to automate this
   process were limited to high-quality scans from mice with no missing
   layers or visible pathology. This paper presents an automatic approach
   for segmenting retinal layers in spectral domain OCT images using
   sparsity based denoising, support vector machines, graph theory, and
   dynamic programming (S-GTDP). Results show that this method accurately
   segments all present retinal layer boundaries, which can range from
   seven to ten, in wild-type and rhodopsin knockout mice as compared to
   manual segmentation and has a more accurate performance as compared to
   the commercial automated Diver segmentation software. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{In this study, we theoretically investigate the sensing potential of 2D
   nano- and micro-ribbon grating structuration on the surface of
   Kretschmann-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors when they
   are employed for detection of biomolecular binding events. Numerical
   simulations were carried out by employing a model based on the
   hybridization of two classical methods, the Fourier modal method and the
   finite element method. Our calculations confirm the importance of light
   manipulation by means of structuration of the plasmonic thin film
   surfaces on the nano- and micro-scales. Not only does it highlight the
   geometric parameters that allow the sensitivity enhancement compared
   with the response of the conventional SPR biosensor based on a flat
   surface but also describes the transition from the regime where the
   propagating surface plasmon mode dominates to the regime where the
   localized surface plasmon mode dominates. An exhaustive mapping of the
   biosensing potential of the 2D nano- and micro-structured biosensors
   surface is presented, varying the structural parameters related to the
   ribbon grating dimensions, i.e., the widths and thicknesses. The nano-
   and micro-structuration also leads to the creation of regions on
   biosensor chips that are characterized by strongly enhanced
   electromagnetic (EM) fields. New opportunities for further improving the
   sensitivity are offered if localization of biomolecules can be carried
   out in these regions of high EM fields. The continuum of nano- and
   micro-ribbon structured biosensors described in this study should prove
   a valuable tool for developing sensitive and reliable 2D-structured
   plasmonic biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of target geo-localization in complex
   multipath environments such as indoor and urban settings. In both radar
   applications (where targets are non-cooperative) and navigation in
   GPS-denied areas using RF signals (where the subject is cooperative),
   multipath propagation is a well-known cause of large geo-location errors
   except in rare cases when a very accurate channel model is available.
   This work addresses more typical situations of uncertain channel
   properties by jointly estimating target position and multipath
   parameters. The proposed Simultaneous Target and Multipath Positioning
   (STAMP) approach involves an application of multi-scan multi-hypothesis
   data association to approximate recursive Bayesian estimates of both
   moving target location as well as specular reflector and point scatterer
   locations. STAMP achieves joint estimation by exploiting the different
   dynamics of targets (e. g., people moving) versus channel parameters (e.
   g., fixed wall locations). Algorithm performance is evaluated in
   simulation for radar localization of a non-cooperative target in an
   uncertain urban multipath environment. In addition, the successful
   demonstration of STAMP geolocation using real wideband microwave data
   collected in an actual building foyer with unknown floor plan is
   discussed. Finally, the issue of identifiability of both target and
   multipath parameters is explored via analysis of the Cramer-Rao Lower
   Bound (CRLB) on joint estimation of target and multipath parameters in
   both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{822-838}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel three-dimensional boundary-element formulation that
   fully characterizes the mechanical behavior of the external boundary of
   a multi-layered viscoelastic coating attached to a hard rotating
   spherical core. The proposed formulation incorporates both, the
   viscoelastic, and the inertial effects of the steady-state rolling
   motion of the sphere, including the Coriolis effect. The proposed
   formulation is based on Fourier-domain expressions of all mechanical
   governing equations. It relates two-dimensional Fourier series
   expansions of surface displacements and stresses, which results in the
   formation of a compliance matrix for the outer boundary of the
   deformable coating, discretized into nodes. The computational cost of
   building such a compliance matrix is optimized, based on configurational
   similarities and symmetry. The proposed formulation is applied, in
   combination with a rolling contact solving strategy, to evaluate the
   viscoelastic rolling friction of a coated sphere on a rigid plane.
   Steady-state results generated by the proposed model are verified by
   comparison to those obtained from running dynamic simulations on a
   three-dimensional finite element model, beyond the transient. A detailed
   application example includes a verification of convergence and
   illustrates the dependence of rolling resistance on the applied load,
   the thickness of the coating, and the rolling velocity. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Recent advances in digital microfluidic biochips have led to a promising
   future for miniaturized laboratories, with the associated advantages of
   high sensitivity and reconfigurability. Since sample preparation plays
   an important front-end role in assays and laboratories in biochemical
   applications, and most of the analysis time is associated with sample
   collection, transportation, and preparation, it is important to minimize
   the time required for this key step in bioassays. Moreover, it is also
   critical to ensure the correctness of intermediate steps and recover
   from errors efficiently during sample preparation. We describe an
   optimization algorithm and the associated chip design method for sample
   preparation, including architectural synthesis and layout synthesis. We
   also present the first dynamic error recovery procedure for use during
   sample preparation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both
   real-life biochemical applications and synthetic test cases to
   demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work,
   the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 50\% reduction in sample
   preparation time, and the optimized chip layout can achieve over 40\%
   reduction in sample preparation time.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced machine learning techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity
   to increase the accuracy of board-level functional fault diagnosis and
   reduce product cost through successful repair. Ambiguous or incorrect
   diagnosis results lead to long debug times and even wrong repair
   actions, which significantly increase repair cost. We propose a smart
   diagnosis method based on multikernel support vector machines (MK-SVMs)
   and incremental learning. The MK-SVM method leverages a linear
   combination of single kernels to achieve accurate faulty-component
   classification based on the errors observed. The MK-SVMs thus generated
   can also be updated based on incremental learning, which allows the
   diagnosis system to quickly adapt to new error observations and provide
   even more accurate fault diagnosis. Two complex boards from industry,
   currently in volume production, are used to validate the proposed
   diagnosis approach in terms of diagnosis accuracy (success rate) and
   quantifiable improvements over previously proposed machine-learning
   methods based on several single-kernel SVMs and artificial neural
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Power switches are used as a part of the power-gating technique to
   reduce the leakage power of a design. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first report in open literature to show a systematic diagnosis
   method for accurately diagnosing power switches. The proposed diagnosis
   method utilizes the recently proposed design-for-test solution for
   efficient testing of power switches in the presence of process, voltage,
   and temperature variation. It divides power switches into segments such
   that any faulty power switch is detectable, thereby achieving high
   diagnosis accuracy. The proposed diagnosis method is validated through
   SPICE simulation using a number of ISCAS benchmarks synthesized with a
   90-nm gate library. Simulation results show that, when considering the
   influence of process variation, the worst case loss of accuracy is less
   than 4.5\%; it is less than 12\% when considering VT variations.}},

Abstract = {{A variational inverse problem is solved using polynomial chaos
   expansions to infer several critical variables in the Hybrid Coordinate
   Ocean Model's (HYCOM's) wind drag parameterization. This alternative to
   the Bayesian inference approach in Sraj et al. avoids the complications
   of constructing the full posterior with Markov chain Monte Carlo
   sampling. It focuses instead on identifying the center and spread of the
   posterior distribution. The present approach leverages the polynomial
   chaos series to estimate, at very little extra cost, the gradients and
   Hessian of the cost function during minimization. The Hessian's inverse
   yields an estimate of the uncertainty in the solution when the latter's
   probability density is approximately Gaussian. The main computational
   burden is an ensemble of realizations to build the polynomial chaos
   expansion; no adjoint code or additional forward model runs are needed
   once the series is available. The ensuing optimal parameters are
   compared to those obtained in Sraj et al. where the full posterior
   distribution was constructed. The similarities and differences between
   the new methodology and a traditional adjoint-based calculation are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Photon-limited imaging arises when the number of photons collected by a
   sensor array is small relative to the number of detector elements.
   Photon limitations are an important concern for many applications such
   as spectral imaging, night vision, nuclear medicine, and astronomy.
   Typically a Poisson distribution is used to model these observations,
   and the inherent heteroscedasticity of the data combined with standard
   noise removal methods yields significant artifacts. This paper
   introduces a novel denoising algorithm for photon-limited images which
   combines elements of dictionary learning and sparse patch-based
   representations of images. The method employs both an adaptation of
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Poisson noise and recently
   developed sparsity-regularized convex optimization algorithms for
   photon-limited images. A comprehensive empirical evaluation of the
   proposed method helps characterize the performance of this approach
   relative to other state-of-the-art denoising methods. The results reveal
   that, despite its conceptual simplicity, Poisson PCA-based denoising
   appears to be highly competitive in very low light regimes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we review the main advances made by our research group on
   the heat transfer performance of complex flow architectures embedded in
   a conducting solid. The immediate applications of this work include the
   design of ground-coupled heat pumps, seasonal thermal energy storage
   systems, and district heating and cooling systems. Various
   configurations are considered: U-shaped ducts with varying spacing
   between the parallel portions of the U, serpentines with three elbows,
   and trees with T-shaped and Y-shaped bifurcations. In each case, the
   volume ratio of fluid to soil is fixed. We found the critical geometric
   features that allow the heat transfer density of the stream-solid
   configuration to be the highest. In the case of U-tubes and serpentines,
   the best spacing between parallel portions is discovered, whereas the
   vascular designs morph into bifurcations and angles of connection that
   provide progressively greater heat transfer rate per unit volume. We
   show that the flow of heat into or out of a solid volume must have an
   S-shaped history curve that is entirely deterministic. This
   constructal-design principle unites a wide variety of previously
   disconnected S-curve phenomena (ground heat storage and retrieval,
   population growth, cancer, chemical reactions, contaminants, languages,
   news, information, innovations, technologies, economic activity).}},

   triclosan, the endpoint being eukaryl communities that have successfully
   vertically migrated through the manipulated sediments. The biological
   communities associated with the 3 treatments (control triclosan, low
   triclosan {[}14mg/kg], and high triclosan {[}180mg/kg]) clustered into 3
   groups: control/low (n=6 controls and 4 low), moderate (n=2 low), and
   high (n=5 high). One sample was discarded as an outlier. The most
   pronounced change as a response to triclosan was the loss of number of
   metazoan operational taxonomic units (OTUs), indicative of the
   control/low and moderate groups, with this being most evident in the
   range of taxa associated with the classes Chromadorea and Bivalvia and
   the phylum Kinorhyncha. The authors also describe a range of other taxa
   that aided discrimination between the groups; compare findings with
   traditionally obtained meio- and macrofaunal communities obtained from
   the same experiment; and illustrate some of the advantages and
   limitations associated with both the molecular and traditional
   approaches. The described approach illustrates the capacity for amplicon
   sequencing to provide ecologically relevant information that can be used
   to strengthen an understanding of how sedimentary communities respond to
   a range of environmental stressors. (c) 2014 SETAC}},

Abstract = {{DNA Holliday junctions are important natural strand-exchange structures
   that form during homologous recombination. Immobile four-arm junctions,
   analogs to Holliday junctions, have been designed to self-assemble into
   cross-tile structures by maximizing Watson-Crick base pairing and fixed
   crossover points. The cross-tiles, self-assembled from base pair
   recognition between designed single-stranded DNAs, form higher order
   lattice structures through cohesion of self-associating sticky ends.
   These cross-tiles have 16 unpaired nucleosides in the central loop at
   the junction of the four duplex stems. The importance of the centralized
   unpaired nucleosides to the structure's thermodynamic stability and
   self-assembly is unknown. Cross-tile DNA nanostructures were designed
   and constructed from nine single-stranded DNAs with four shell strands,
   four arms, and a central loop containing 16 unpaired bases. The 16
   unpaired bases were either 2-deoxyribothymidines,
   2-O-methylribouridines, or abasic 1,2-dideoxyribonucleosides.
   Thermodynamic profiles and structural base-stacking contributions were
   assessed using UV absorption spectroscopy during thermal denaturation
   and circular dichroism spectroscopy, respectively, and the resulting
   structures were observed by atomic force microscopy. There were
   surprisingly significant changes in the thermodynamic and structural
   properties of lattice formation as a result of altering only the 16
   unpaired, centralized nucleosides. The 16 unpaired 2-O-methyluridines
   were stabilizing and produced uniform tubular structures. In contrast,
   the abasic nucleosides were destabilizing producing a mixture of
   structures. These results strongly indicate the importance of a small
   number of centrally located unpaired nucleosides within the structures.
   Since minor modifications lead to palpable changes in lattice formation,
   DNA cross-tiles present an easily manipulated structure convenient for
   applications in biomedical and biosensing devices.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical loading of joints plays a critical role in maintaining the
   health and function of articular cartilage. The mechanism(s) of
   chondrocyte mechanotransduction are not fully understood, but could
   provide important insights into new physical or pharmacologic therapies
   for joint diseases. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a
   Ca2+-permeable osmomechano-TRP channel, is highly expressed in articular
   chondrocytes, and loss of TRPV4 function is associated with joint
   arthropathy and osteoarthritis. The goal of this study was to examine
   the hypothesis that TRPV4 transduces dynamic compressive loading in
   articular chondrocytes. We first confirmed the presence of physically
   induced, TRPV4-dependent intracellular Ca2+ signaling in
   agarose-embedded chondrocytes, and then used this model system to study
   the role of TRPV4 in regulating the response of chondrocytes to dynamic
   compression. Inhibition of TRPV4 during dynamic loading prevented acute,
   mechanically mediated regulation of proanabolic and anticatabolic genes,
   and furthermore, blocked the loading-induced enhancement of matrix
   accumulation and mechanical properties. Furthermore, chemical activation
   of TRPV4 by the agonist GSK1016790A in the absence of mechanical loading
   similarly enhanced anabolic and suppressed catabolic gene expression,
   and potently increased matrix biosynthesis and construct mechanical
   properties. These findings support the hypothesis that TRPV4-mediated
   Ca2+ signaling plays a central role in the transduction of mechanical
   signals to support cartilage extracellular matrix maintenance and joint
   health. Moreover, these insights raise the possibility of
   therapeutically targeting TRPV4-mediated mechanotransduction for the
   treatment of diseases such as osteoarthritis, as well as to enhance
   matrix formation and functional properties of tissue-engineered
   cartilage as an alternative to bioreactor-based mechanical stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{Although L-dopa continues to be the gold standard for treating motor
   symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), it presents long-term
   complications. Deep brain stimulation is effective, but only a small
   percentage of idiopathic PD patients are eligible. Based on results in
   animal models and a handful of patients, dorsal column stimulation (DCS)
   has been proposed as a potential therapy for PD. To date, the long-term
   effects of DCS in animal models have not been quantified. Here, we
   report that DCS applied twice a week in rats treated with bilateral
   6-OHDA striatal infusions led to a significant improvement in symptoms.
   DCS-treated rats exhibited a higher density of dopaminergic innervation
   in the striatum and higher neuronal cell count in the substantia nigra
   pars compacta compared to a control group. These results suggest that
   DCS has a chronic therapeutical and neuroprotective effect, increasing
   its potential as a new clinical option for treating PD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer products such as clothing and medical products are increasingly
   integrating silver and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into base materials
   to serve as an antimicrobial agent. Thus, it is critical to assess the
   effects of AgNPs on wastewater microorganisms essential to biological
   nutrient removal. In the present study, pulse and continuous additions
   of 0.2 and 2 ppm gum arabic and citrate coated AgNPs as well as Ag as
   AgNO3 were fed into sequencing batch reactors'. (SBRs) inoculated with
   nitrifying sludge. Treatment efficiency (chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   and ammonia removal), Ag dissolution measurements, and 16S rRNA
   bacterial community analyses (terminal restriction fragment length
   polymorphism, T-RFLP) were performed to evaluate the response of the
   SBRs to Ag addition. Results suggest that the AgNPs may have been
   precipitating in the SBRs. While COD and ammonia removal decreased by as
   much as 30\% or greater directly after spikes, SBRs were able to recover
   within (3 hydraulic retention times (HRTs)) and resume removal near
   95\%. T-RFLP results indicate Ag spiked SBRs were similar in a 16s rRNA
   bacterial community. The results shown in this study indicate that
   wastewater treatment could be impacted by Ag and AgNPs in the short term
   but the amount of treatment disruption will depend on the magnitude of
   influent Ag.}},

Abstract = {{A number of parameterization schemes are available to determine the
   collection efficiency of ultrafine particles (UFP) onto vegetated
   surfaces. One approach represents the vegetated elements as a fibrous
   filter with a characteristic fiber size that is difficult to a priori
   determine, while the other, a more conventional approach, represents
   vegetation as a porous medium. To date, no attempts have been made to
   compare the performance of these two distinct approaches or bridge them
   so as to show the necessary conditions leading to their potential
   equivalence. In a wind tunnel study, the UFP collection efficiencies of
   pine branches at five different wind speeds, two branch orientations,
   and two packing densities were measured and analyzed using these two
   vegetation representations. This vegetation type was selected because
   pines are a dominant species in the Southeastern United States and pine
   needles geometrically resemble fibrous material with a well-defined
   foliage diameter. The porous media and the fibrous filter
   representations described well observed UFP deposition at the branch
   scale. Conditions promoting their equivalence are thus explored. The
   difficult to determine effective fiber diameter was recovered from
   conventional canopy attributes such as the leaf area index by matching
   the collection efficiencies of UFP for the two vegetation
   representations. These results provide a working aerodynamic definition
   of the effective single-fiber diameter thereby rendering the simplified
   single-fiber formulation usable in large-scale atmospheric deposition
   models. Furthermore, the aerodynamic correction factor allows upscaling
   of pine needles to an effective leaf area index and provides some
   quantification of the effect of needle spatial clustering on UFP
   deposition. The applicability of the results to other vegetation species
   remains to be verified.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between organic matter (OM) and engineered polymer coatings
   as they affect the retention of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
   polymer-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were studied. Two distinct
   types of OM-cysteine representing low molecular weight multivalent
   functional groups, and Suwannee River Humic Acid (HA) representing high
   molecular weight polymers, were investigated with respect to their
   effects on particle stability in aggregation and deposition. Aggregation
   of the PVP coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) was enhanced by cysteine addition at
   high ionic strengths, which was attributed to cysteine binding to the
   AgNPs and replacing the otherwise steric stabilizing agent PVP. In
   contrast the addition of HA did not increase aggregation rates and
   decreased PVP-AgNP deposition to the silica porous medium, consistent
   with enhanced electrosteric stabilization by the HA. Although cysteine
   also reduced deposition in the porous medium, the mechanisms of reduced
   deposition appear to be enhanced electric double layer (EDL) interaction
   at low ionic strengths. At higher ionic strengths, aggregation was
   favored leading to lower deposition due to smaller diffusion
   coefficients and single collector efficiencies despite the reduced EDL
   interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{264}},
Pages = {{380-385}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Mercury emissions from coal combustion have become a global concern as
   growing energy demands have increased the consumption of coal. The
   effective implementation of treatment technologies requires knowledge of
   mercury speciation in the flue gas, namely concentrations of elemental,
   oxidized and particulate mercury at the exit of the boiler. A model that
   can accurately predict mercury species in flue gas would be very useful
   in that context. Here, a Bayesian regularized artificial neural network
   (BRANN) that uses five coal properties and combustion temperature was
   developed to predict mercury speciation in flue gases before treatment
   technology implementation. The results of the model show that up to 97
   percent of the variation in mercury species concentration is captured
   through the use of BRANNs. The BRANN model was used to conduct a
   parametric sensitivity which revealed that the coal chlorine content and
   coal calorific value were the most sensitive parameters, followed by the
   combustion temperature. The coal sulfur content was the least important
   parameter. The results demonstrate the applicability of BRANNs for
   predicting mercury concentration and speciation in combustion flue gas
   and provide a more efficient and effective technique when compared to
   other advanced non-mechanistic modeling strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Numerical simulation of shock initiation of Ni/Al multilayered
   composites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{The initiation of chemical reaction in cold-rolled Ni/Al multilayered
   composites by shock compression is investigated numerically. A
   simplified approach is adopted that exploits the disparity between the
   reaction and shock loading timescales. The impact of shock compression
   is modeled using CTH simulations that yield pressure, strain, and
   temperature distributions within the composites due to the shock
   propagation. The resulting temperature distribution is then used as
   initial condition to simulate the evolution of the subsequent
   shock-induced mixing and chemical reaction. To this end, a reduced
   reaction model is used that expresses the local atomic mixing and heat
   release rates in terms of an evolution equation for a dimensionless time
   scale reflecting the age of the mixed layer. The computations are used
   to assess the effect of bilayer thickness on the reaction, as well as
   the impact of shock velocity and orientation with respect to the
   layering. Computed results indicate that initiation and evolution of the
   reaction are substantially affected by both the shock velocity and the
   bilayer thickness. In particular, at low impact velocity, Ni/Al
   multilayered composites with thick bilayers react completely in 100 ms
   while at high impact velocity and thin bilayers, reaction time was less
   than 100 mu s. Quantitative trends for the dependence of the reaction
   time on the shock velocity are also determined, for different bilayer
   thickness and shock orientation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to wirelessly power electrical devices is becoming of
   greater urgency as a component of energy conservation and sustainability
   efforts. Due to health and safety concerns, most wireless power transfer
   (WPT) schemes utilize very low frequency, quasi-static, magnetic fields;
   power transfer occurs via magneto-inductive (MI) coupling between
   conducting loops serving as transmitter and receiver. At the ``long
   range{''} regime - referring to distances larger than the diameter of
   the largest loop - WPT efficiency in free space falls off as (1/d)(6);
   power loss quickly approaches 100\% and limits practical implementations
   of WPT to relatively tight distances between power source and device. A
   ``superlens'', however, can concentrate the magnetic near fields of a
   source. Here, we demonstrate the impact of a magnetic metamaterial (MM)
   superlens on long-range near-field WPT, quantitatively confirming in
   simulation and measurement at 13-16 MHz the conditions under which the
   superlens can enhance power transfer efficiency compared to the
   lens-less free-space system.}},

Abstract = {{Phase shift epitaxy (PSE) is a periodic growth scheme, which
   desynchronizes host material growth process from dopant incorporation,
   allowing independent optimization. p-type doping of GaN with Mg by PSE
   is accomplished with molecular beam epitaxy by periodic shutter action
   (in order to iterate between Ga- and N-rich surface conditions) and by
   adjusting time delays between dopant and Ga shutters. Optimum PSE growth
   was obtained by turning on the Mg flux in the N-rich condition. This
   suppresses Mg self-compensation at high Mg concentration and produces
   fairly high hole concentrations (2.4 x 10(18) cm(-3)). (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Altered joint motion has been thought to be a contributing factor in the
   long-term development of osteoarthritis after ACL reconstruction. While
   many studies have quantified knee kinematics after ACL injury and
   reconstruction, there is limited in vivo data characterizing the effects
   of altered knee motion on cartilage thickness distributions. Thus, the
   objective of this study was to compare cartilage thickness distributions
   in two groups of patients with ACL reconstruction: one group in which
   subjects received a non-anatomic reconstruction that resulted in
   abnormal joint motion and another group in which subjects received an
   anatomically placed graft that more closely restored normal knee motion.
   Ten patients with anatomic graft placement (mean follow-up: 20 months)
   and 12 patients with non-anatomic graft placement (mean follow-up: 18
   months) were scanned using high-resolution MR imaging. These images were
   used to generate 3D mesh models of both knees of each patient. The
   operative and contralateral knee models were registered to each other
   and a grid sampling system was used to make site-specific comparisons of
   cartilage thickness. Patients in the non-anatomic graft placement group
   demonstrated a significant decrease in cartilage thickness along the
   medial intercondylar notch in the operative knee relative to the intact
   knee (8\%). In the anatomic graft placement group, no significant
   changes were observed. These findings suggest that restoring normal knee
   motion after ACL injury may help to slow the progression of
   degeneration. Therefore, graft placement may have important implications
   on the development of osteoarthritis after ACL reconstruction. (C) 2013

   The performance of the three imaging methods for reconstructing tumor

   the anatomically realistic numerical breast phantoms derived from
   T1-weighted MRIs of prone patients. Through the simulation results, the
   IRM proves to have better imaging results than TRM and consume much less

   the clutter and the noise as a single parameter; differently, we deal

   assumed to be obtained in advance and the clutter is distributed
   according to a certain distribution. An adaptive target detector which
   utilizes the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the clutter covariance
   and the MLE of the signal of interest (SOT) is proposed. The detector
   has a simpler expression than the published detectors. To validate its
   detection performance, the proposed detector is compared with three

Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer (WPT) has become a very important technology. It
   is necessary to maximize the transferred power, the transfer distance,
   and the transfer efficiency for implementation of a practical WPT
   system. The performance of the WPT system can be efficiently maximized
   through accurate simulation with more accurate equivalent circuit model
   of each component in the WPT system in the design stage. This paper
   proposes and validates a process for modeling a coil module for a WPT
   system by two-port S-parameter measurement in the frequency domain. The
   coil parameters such as self-inductance, internal resistance, and
   magnetic coupling coefficient are calculated using the ABCD parameter,
   which is transformed from the measured S-parameter of a given coil
   module. The two-port S-parameter in a frequency range from 30 kHz to 1
   MHz was measured using the Vector Network Analyzer. The extracted
   self-inductances and internal resistances of transmitting and receiving
   coils were confirmed by a one-port measurement method. The proposed
   modeling process based on two-port S-parameter measurement for the coil
   module will be helpful in maximizing the performance of a WPT system.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, butterfly shaped photoconductive antennas (PCAs) on
   low-temperature grown (LT) GaAs and semi-insulating (SI) GaAs substrate
   as terahertz (THz) emitters are experimentally characterized and
   compared. Dependences of the THz radiated field on the applied DC bias
   voltage and laser pump power are compared. Quadratic DC bias dependence
   is seen for SI-GaAs PCA compared to a linear dependence for LT-GaAs PCA.
   Scaling rule can be applied to the laser power dependence to fit the
   measurement data and the saturation can be attributed to the screening
   effect. Studies of material property influence on THz radiated power
   allow exploration of ways to enhance PCA performance.}},

Abstract = {{A novel triple band planar antenna using a four-stubloaded ring-slot on
   the ground and a U-slot on the microstrip-fed line is presented. The
   ring slot is designed to drive two different resonant modes, and the
   four T-shaped stubs are loaded to lower these two resonant frequencies.
   Moreover, a U-shaped slot etched on the microstrip feeding line is to
   excite a third upper frequency band without increasing the overall size
   of the antenna. The computational analysis and measurement illustrate
   that the proposed antenna can cover three frequency bands of 2.4, 3.5,

Abstract = {{We propose a mixed order formulation of the combined field volume
   integral equation (CFVIE) for inhomogeneous anisotropic
   magnetodielectric objects. This method uses the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG)
   basis functions to expand flux densities while second order curl
   conforming basis functions are used to expand vector potentials. In this
   case, both dielectric and magnetic contrasts of the objects can be
   accounted for in the CFVIE formulation. Moreover, correct boundary
   conditions are imposed on both flux densities and vector potentials.
   Finally, the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient fast Fourier transform
   (BCGS-FFT) method is employed to solve the integral equations. Numerical
   examples show that this method can handle large size objects with
   inhomogeneous or anisotropic magnetodielectric materials. The scattered
   fields calculated by this method have excellent agreement with both MIE
   solution and the results from commercial software.}},

Abstract = {{Under dynamic loading, systems with the requisite condition for
   snap-through buckling, that is co-existing equilibria, typically exhibit
   either small amplitude response about a single equilibrium
   configuration, or large amplitude response that transits between the
   static equilibria. Dynamic snap-through is the name given to the large
   amplitude response, which, in the context of structural systems, is
   obviously undesirable.
   Structures with underlying snap-through static behavior may exhibit
   highly nonlinear and unpredictable oscillations. Such systems rarely
   lend themselves to investigation by analytical means. This is not
   surprising as nonlinear phenomena such as chaos run counter to the
   predictability of an analytical closed form solution. However, many
   unexpected analytical approximations of global stability may be obtained
   for simple systems using the harmonic balance method.
   In this paper a simple single-degree-of-freedom arch is studied using
   the harmonic balance method. The equations developed with the harmonic
   balance approach are then solved using an arc-length method and an
   approximate snap-through boundary in forcing parameter space is
   obtained. The method is shown to exhibit excellent agreement with
   numerical results. Arches present an ideal avenue for the investigation
   of snap-through as they typically have multiple, often tunable, stable
   and unstable equilibria. They also have many applications in both civil
   engineering, where arches are a canonical structural element, and
   mechanical/aerospace engineering, where arches may be used to
   approximate the behavior of curved plates and panels such as those used
   on aircraft.}},

   via high-speed coding, manifested via translation of a single coded
   aperture; the inexpensive translation is constituted by mounting the
   binary code on a piezoelectric device. To simultaneously recover depth
   information, a liquid lens is modulated at high speed, via a variable
   voltage. Consequently, during the aforementioned coding process, the
   liquid lens allows the camera to sweep the focus through multiple
   depths. In addition to designing and implementing the camera, fast
   recovery is achieved by an anytime algorithm exploiting the
   group-sparsity of wavelet/DCT coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{Vortex-induced vibration is a fluid instability present in many areas,
   including offshore platforms, wind turbines, and turbomachinery. The
   vortices due to secondary flows exert an periodic unsteady force on the
   elastic structure, leading to potentially dangerous vibrations. Under
   certain circumstances, the shedding frequency can lock into the
   structure natural frequency and lead to limit cycle oscillations. These
   high amplitude vibrations can cause material fatigue, and are a common
   source of structural failure.
   This work uses a frequency domain, harmonic balance, CFD code to predict
   the lock-in of an airfoil at very high angles of attack. The natural
   shedding frequency is found using a delta phase per iteration method,
   and the lock-in region is identified by enforcing airfoil motion at
   different oscillation amplitudes and frequencies. The numerical results
   are successfully compared to experimental data from wind tunnel testing
   on a NACA0012 airfoil at deep stall conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The paper develops a reduced-order model of non-synchronous vibration
   (NSV) using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) methods. The approach
   was successfully developed and implemented, requiring between two and
   six POD modes to accurately predict CFD solutions that are experiencing
   non-synchronous vibration. This POD method was first developed and
   demonstrated for a transversely-moving, two-dimensional cylinder in
   cross-flow. Later, the method was used for the prediction of CFD
   solutions for a two-dimensional compressor blade.
   This research is the first to offer a proper orthogonal decomposition
   approach to the reduced-order modeling of non-synchronous vibration in
   turbomachinely. Modeling non-synchronous vibration is especially
   challenging because NSV is caused by complicated, unsteady flow
   dynamics; this initial study helps researchers understand the causes of
   NSV and aids in the future development of predictive tools for
   aeromechanical design engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The explosive growth of data generation and increasing reliance of
   business analysis on massive data make data loss more damaging than ever
   before. Nowadays many organizations start relying on cloud services for
   keeping their valuable data. It is a critical issue for cloud service
   provider to protect the data for individual users securely and
   effectively. To protect the data in a system with multiple data sources,
   backup schedule plays an important role for achieving the desired level
   of data protection while minimizing the impact on system operation, In
   this paper we investigate the use of Markov Decision Process (MDP) to
   guide the scheduling of data backup operation and propose a framework to
   automatically generate an MDP instance from system specifications and
   data protection requirements. We then demonstrate the benefits of the
   MDP approach.}},

Abstract = {{Output-bit selection is a recently proposed test-response compaction
   approach that can effectively deal with aliasing, unknown-value, and
   low-diagnosis problems. This approach has been implemented using a
   single counter and a multiplexer without considering unknown values.
   Also, such an implementation may require the application of a pattern
   multiple times in order to observe all selected responses. In this
   paper, we present a multiple-counter-based architecture with a new
   selection algorithm that can avoid most unknown-values yet achieve high
   compaction ratio. The remaining small number of unknowns can then be
   dealt with using some simple masking logic. Experiments on IWLS' 05
   circuits show that even with 16\% unknown responses, all unknown values
   can be handled with 88.92\%similar to 93.21\% response-volume reduction
   still achieved and only a moderate increase in test-application time.}},

Abstract = {{In nanoscale technology nodes, process and runtime variations have
   emerged as the major sources of timing uncertainties which may
   ultimately result in circuit failure due to timing violation. Therefore,
   in-field chip health monitoring is essential to track workload-induced
   variations at runtime in a per-chip basis. There exist a variety of
   monitoring circuits to track the delay changes of different on-chip
   components. However, existing techniques either need to stop normal
   execution of the chip or introduce a significant overhead unless they
   are carefully placed for very selective locations. Another challenge is
   to infer the information regarding the health of every critical paths of
   the chip with limited information obtained by the monitoring system. We
   address these challenges in this work using a representative
   path-selection technique based on machine learning. This technique
   allows us to measure the delay of a small subset of paths and assess the
   circuit-level impact of workload for a larger pool of
   reliability-critical paths.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates wave propagation and energy absorption in a 1D
   array of axially aligned pendulums under various forms of base
   excitation. In the system studied, each pair of pendulums comprising a
   single unit cell is connected through linear torsional coupling, and
   asymmetry is introduced by varying their masses. Similar to
   translational systems, when subjected to harmonic base excitation, band
   gaps are observed in this rotational system over predictable frequency
   ranges. It is observed that varying the uncoupled restoring force
   parameters (mass and gravitational strength) shifts the expected band
   gap regions under harmonic excitation. This asymmetry in pendulum masses
   can also be exploited for the purposes of energy absorption when the
   system is subjected to base excitation in the form of an impulse.
   Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the accuracy of
   analytical solutions for both types of external forcing.}},

   motion to synthesize an array that can achieve the performance of a

   for spatial Nyquist sampling. The class of physical arrays we use for
   synthesis are co-prime arrays constructed by nesting under-sampled ULA's
   with co-prime inter-element spacings. In particular, we use array motion
   to fill in missing co-array spacings. For co-prime M and N, a physical
   array of M + 2 N - 1 sensors plus modest array motion is used to achieve
   a filled co-array corresponding to approximately 2 M N elements. This
   facilitates spatial spectral estimation via non-adaptive beamforming
   over an extended aperture with low sidelobe performance.}},

Abstract = {{Application servers (AS) of virtualized platform may suffer from
   software aging problem. In this paper, we first formulate the system
   model including three virtual machines. Two of them act as the main
   servers, and the third machine acts as the backup node. The motivation
   of our formulated model is that the relationship between the service
   provider and the service maintainer is collaborative as well as having
   different goals between them, the service provider as a leader wants to
   maximize his system availability, while the service maintainer wants to
   minimize his maintenance cost. Thus, the problem of maximizing
   availability and minimizing cost between the service provider and
   service maintainer is Stackelberg game based. Next, we assume that the
   AS degradation is caused by resource consumption due to memory leaks for
   the AS on the active VMs, and we present the system degradation states
   based on Markov renewal processes. We give the analytical definitions of
   threshold levels for R-alert at each VM, which are used to determine the
   optimal rejuvenation schedules. In addition, we obtain the steady-state
   availability expressions for the system and the mean maintenance cost.
   Finally, we give the Stackelberg strategy with the open-loop information
   and the solutions for the game theory by a numerical illustration.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a catalyst produced by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP)
   was evaluated for its ability to produce hydrogen-rich gas mixtures.
   Catalyst particles fabricated by a novel flame spray pyrolysis method
   resulting in a highly active catalyst with high surface-to-volume ratio
   were compared to a commercially produced catalyst (BASF F3-01). Both
   catalysts consisted of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 of identical composition (CuO
   40wt\%, ZnO 40wt\%, Al2O3 20wt\%). Reaction temperatures between 220 and
   295 degrees C, methanol-water inlet flow rates between 2 and 50 mu
   l/min, and reactor masses between 25 and 100 mg were tested for their
   effect on methanol conversion and the production of undesired carbon
   monoxide. 100\% methanol conversion can be easily achieved within the
   operational conditions mentioned for this flame-made catalyst - at
   reactor temperatures of 255 degrees C (achievable with non-concentrating
   solar collectors) more than 80\% methanol conversion can be reached for
   methanol-water inlet flow rates as high as 10 mu l/min. The FSP catalyst
   demonstrates similar catalytic abilities as the BASF, produces a
   consistent gas composition and produces lower overall CO production.
   Furthermore, the FSP catalyst demonstrates a better suitability to fuel
   cell use through its higher resistance to degradation and smaller
   production of carbon monoxide over long-term use.
   In the present study, the merits of using flame spray pyrolysis to
   produce CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 methanol steam reforming catalysts are examined,
   and directly compared to catalysts that are commercially produced in
   bulk pellet form, and then ground and sieved. The comparison is
   performed from several different perspectives: catalytic activity and CO
   production at various temperatures and fuel inlet flow rates; surface
   and structure characteristics are determined via scanning electron and
   transmission electron microscopy; surface area characteristics are
   determined via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) tests.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is the proof that non-concentrating
   solar-thermal collectors can supply the thermal energy needed to power
   endothermic chemical reactions such as steam reforming of alcoholic
   (bio-) fuels. Traditional steam reformers require the combustion of up
   to 50\% of the primary fuel to enable the endothermic reforming
   reaction. Our goal is to use a selective solar absorber coating on top
   of a collector-reactor surrounded by vacuum insulation. For methanol
   reforming, a reaction temperature of 220-250 degrees C is required for
   effective methanol-to-hydrogen conversion. A multilayer absorber coating
   (TiNOX) is used, as well as a turbomolecular pump to reach ultra-high.
   The collector-reactor is made of copper tubes and plates and a
   Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst is integrated in a porous ceramic structure
   towards the end of the reactor tube. The device is tested under 1000
   W/m(2) solar irradiation (using an ABB class solar simulator, air mass
   1.5).
   Numerical and experimental results show that convective and conductive
   heat losses are eliminated at vacuum pressures of <10(-4) Torn By
   reducing radiative losses through chemical polishing of the
   non-absorbing surfaces, the methanol-water mixture can be effectively
   heated to 240-250 degrees C and converted to hydrogen-rich gas mixture.
   For liquid methanol-water inlet flow rates up to 1 ml/min per m(2) of
   solar collector area can be converted to hydrogen with a methanol

Abstract = {{Competitive cyclists seek to maximize their efficiency by minimizing the
   influence of resistive forces. At the high speeds maintained during
   competition, aerodynamic drag is the primary resistive force. This paper
   investigates the influence of a cyclist's body position using models of
   aerodynamic drag and elucidates the time benefit of various body
   positions. Mathematical models from prior work, which use cyclist mass
   and body position angles, have been used to determine the projected
   frontal area of a cyclist and the aerodynamic drag. Graphical
   representation of the non-linear relationship between aerodynamic drag
   and an increasing velocity are also provided. Finally, simulations are
   produced for a 40 km time trial course, and the results indicate a
   maximum performance increase of 20.71\% due entirely to rider body
   position when exerting 400 W. We conclude aerodynamic efficiency is
   crucial in competitive cycling, and its significant correlation with
   rider body position should not be ignored.}},

Abstract = {{Bicycle stability has been of interest to dynamicists and athletes since
   before J. W. Whipple described the canonical model for bicycle motion in
   1899. Since then, the subject has fascinated many who sought to find a
   simple way to describe the essence of stability for a hands free bicycle
   at a prescribed forward speed. Caster and gyroscopic effects have been
   shown to be helpful, but not necessary for there to exist a stable range
   of forward speeds. This work focuses on showing how using the
   eigenvalues of the linearized equations for roll and steer (with and
   without a steering torque) can illuminate the stabilizing and
   destabilizing effects of changing bicycle geometry and rider position.
   Of particular interest is the mathematical demonstration of the
   decreased stability a cyclist on a time trial bike experiences when in
   the aerodynamic position, as opposed to riding with hands on the brake
   hoods or bull horns.}},

Abstract = {{Au/alpha-Fe2O3 catalyst was synthesized using a modified
   co-precipitation method to generate an inverse catalyst model. The
   effects of introducing CO2 and H2O during preferential oxidation (PROX)
   of CO were investigated. The goal of this work was >= 99.8\% CO
   conversion at 80 degrees C. There was an increase in the conversion at
   all temperatures with the introduction of CO2 and 100\% of the CO was
   converted at the target temperature of 80 degrees C for any amount of
   CO2. Furthermore, there was an increase in conversion to 100\% for water
   fractions ranging from 3\% to 10\%.
   Finally, for realistic conditions of (bio-)fuel reforming, 24\% CO2 and
   10\% water, 99.85\% conversion was achieved. A long-term test of 200
   hours showed no significant deactivation of the catalyst at a
   temperature of 80 degrees C in presence of 24\% CO2 and 3\% water. The
   mechanism for PROX is not known definitively, however, current
   literature believes the gold particle size is the key. In contrast, we
   emphasize the tremendous role of the support particle size.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic mechanical loading can enhance the formation of engineered
   cartilage, potentially through secondary biophysical effects such as
   changes in interstitial osmolarity. This study examined the effects of
   daily osmotic loading, as well as direct activation of the osmosensitive
   ion channel TRPV4, on the biochemical and functional properties of
   chondrocyte-laden cartilage constructs. Osmotic loading, as well as
   exposure to the TRPV4-specific agonist GSK1016790A, enhanced
   extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, and TRPV4 activation enhanced
   the functional properties of the constructs. This study implicates the
   Ca++-permeable TRPV4 ion channel in the metabolic response of articular
   chondrocytes to osmotic and mechanical loading. Furthermore, these
   results suggest that targeting TRPV4, either directly with channel
   agonists, or indirectly via osmotic loading, may provide a novel
   strategy for enhancing tissue engineered cartilage construct maturation.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing of broadband (<1 Hz to 300 kHz) lightning signals related
   to terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) indicates that gamma-rays in
   TGFs are typically produced during a slow process that creates a
   considerable charge moment change within a few milliseconds. This slow
   process is usually punctuated by one or more fast discharges one of
   which is involved in gamma-ray production. The observed complexity of
   TGF-associated lightning emissions can be interpreted in the context of
   the initial development of normal intra-cloud lightning flashes, where
   the upward negative leader drives the millisecond-scale current and may
   also provide the seed electrons for avalanche multiplication in the

Abstract = {{With the explosive growth of the Internet traffic, data compression can
   be a powerful technique to improve the efficiency of data transfer in
   networks and consequently reduce the cost associated with the
   transmission of such data. Recently, we proposed a memory-assisted
   compression framework that utilizes the packet-level memorized context
   to reduce the inevitable redundancy in the universal compression of the
   payloads of the short-length network packets. In this paper, we
   investigate the practical aspects of implementing cluster-based
   memory-assisted compression and proposed a non-parametric clustering
   algorithm for training packet selection. We demonstrate that, when
   compression speed is not an issue, our proposed non-parametric
   clustering algorithm with Lite PAQ compression algorithm can achieve
   nearly 70\% traffic reduction on real data gathered from Internet
   traffic. We also explore the trade-off between the memory-assisted
   compression speed and performance using different clustering algorithms
   and compression methods.}},

Abstract = {{Graphics processing units (GPUs) have specialized throughput-oriented
   memory systems optimized for streaming writes with scratchpad memories
   to capture locality explicitly. Expanding the utility of GPUs beyond
   graphics encourages designs that simplify programming (e.g., using
   caches instead of scratchpads) and better support irregular applications
   with finer-grain synchronization. Our hypothesis is that, like CPUs,
   GPUs will benefit from caches and coherence, but that CPU-style ``read
   for ownership{''} (RFO) coherence is inappropriate to maintain support
   for regular streaming workloads.
   This paper proposes QuickRelease (QR), which improves on conventional
   GPU memory systems in two ways. First, QR uses a FIFO to enforce the
   partial order of writes so that synchronization operations can complete
   without frequent cache flushes. Thus, non-synchronizing threads in QR
   can re-use cached data even when other threads are performing
   synchronization. Second, QR partitions the resources required by reads
   and writes to reduce the penalty of writes on read performance.
   Simulation results across a wide variety of general-purpose GPU
   workloads show that QR achieves a 7\% average performance improvement
   compared to a conventional GPU memory system. Furthermore, for emerging
   workloads with finer-grain synchronization, QR achieves up to 42\%
   performance improvement compared to a conventional GPU memory system
   without the scalability challenges of RFO coherence. To this end, QR
   provides a throughput-oriented solution to provide fine-grain
   synchronization on GPUs.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic power management (DPM) is critical to maximizing the performance
   of systems ranging from multicore processors to datacenters. However,
   one formidable challenge with DPM schemes is verifying that the DPM
   schemes are correct as the number of computational resources scales up.
   In this paper, we develop a DPM scheme such that it is scalably
   verifiable with fully automated formal tools. The key to the design is
   that the DPM scheme has fractal behavior; that is, it behaves the same
   at every scale. We show that the fractal design enables scalable formal
   verification and simulation shows that our scheme does not sacrifice
   much performance compared to an oracle DPM scheme that optimally
   allocates power to computational resources. We implement our scheme in a
   2-socket 16-core x86 system and experimentally evaluate it.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual machines (VM) are used in cloud computing systems to handle user
   requests for service. A typical user request goes through several cloud
   service provider specific processing steps from the instant it is
   submitted until the service is completed. In the process of providing
   the service, VM failures cause the user's request to be dropped. To
   mitigate the adverse impact of VM failure, replication mechanisms,
   either using cold, warm or hot replication, can be used. In this paper,
   we model the system behavior with a structure-state process to
   characterize the failure-recovery behavior of a VM in a cloud that uses
   one of the aforementioned replication schemes. We use a service-oriented
   dependability metric called Defects Per Million (DPM), defined as the
   number of user requests dropped out of a million. The structure-state
   process approach is used to analyze the job completion time distribution
   and subsequently we compute the DPM by counting the number of requests
   exceed the specified deadline. The effectiveness of replication schemes
   are demonstrated through numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{Recently a novel test response compaction method called output selection
   is proposed to achieve high compaction ratio and high diagnosibility by
   observing only a subset of output response bits. In addition, this
   method also ensures zero aliasing and no unknown-value problem.
   Previously, a single counter and a multiplexer are employed as selection
   logic for output selection on scan-based designs. This
   single-counter-based approach may need to apply one pattern several
   times in order to observe all selection responses, hence may
   significantly increase the test application time. To address this
   weakness, this paper presents a multiple-counter-based output selection
   method to observe more than one output response bits at each scan-out
   cycle. A new response selection algorithm is developed to determine
   desired responses under a set of pre-defined counter operations. Results
   on IWLS'05 benchmarks show that compared with the single counter-based
   scheme, the proposed method can reduce 47.33\%similar to 67.87\% test
   application time with only slight increase on area overhead.}},

Abstract = {{A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology
   platform for revolutionizing immunoassays, clinical diagnostics, drug
   discovery, DNA sequencing, and other laboratory procedures in
   biochemistry. In most of these applications, real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) is an indispensable step for amplifying specific DNA
   segments. Compared with traditional PCR platforms, DMFBs offer the
   benefits of smaller size, higher sensitivity and quicker
   time-to-results. Heater design is critical for any on-chip PCR
   implementation because it is closely related to each step of the PCR. In
   this paper, we propose a combined electrode/heater structure that can
   realize the functions of both heating and electrowetting-on-dielectric
   (EWOD) actuation, and we systematically analyze and compare this heater
   design to the conventional square-shaped heater. The heating efficiency
   and thermal response of both the proposed and conventional heater
   structure are studied through detailed COMSOL Multiphysics simulations.
   Based on our heater design, a corresponding self-adaptive heating system
   is also proposed for precise temperature control.}},

Abstract = {{Even though system-on-chip (SoC) testing at multiple voltage settings
   significantly increases test complexity, the use of a different shift
   frequency at each voltage setting offers parallelism that can be
   exploited by time-division multiplexing (TDM) to reduce test length. We
   show that TDM is especially effective for small-bitwidth and heavily
   loaded test-access mechanisms (TAMs), thereby tangibly increasing the
   effectiveness of multi-site testing. However, TDM suffers from some
   inherent limitations that do not allow the fullest possible exploitation
   of TAM bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, we propose
   space-division multiplexing (SDM), which complements TDM and offers
   higher multi-site test efficiency. We implement spaceand time-division
   multiplexing (STDM) using a new, scalable test-time minimization method
   based on a combination of bin packing and simulated annealing. Results
   for industrial SoCs, highlight the advantages of the proposed
   optimization method.}},

Abstract = {{Water Cherenkov neutrino detectors, like the existing Super-Kamiokande
   ({''}Super-K{''}) and the planned Hyper-Kamiokande ({''}Hyper-K{''})
   detectors, are used to study neutrino particle physics. These detectors
   consist of large vessels holding many thousands of tons of water, as
   well as tens of thousands of photomultiplier tubes. Such detectors
   produce large and multi-layered datasets well-suited to immersive
   visualization and interaction. We have developed a novel virtual reality
   (VR) application called Neutrino-KAVE which functions as an
   visualization and data interaction application. Neutrino-KAVE displays
   the collocation of photon sensors and their color-coded data within a
   to-scale representation of the Super-K or Hyper-K detector, and provides
   a new visualization technique for neutrino interaction patterns.
   Neutrino-KAVE also provides both a mechanism for modifying aspects of
   the presented data set, and a user interface for system control of this
   multifaceted application. In this paper, we describe in detail our
   implementation and design choices. We also report on its use cases,
   initial reception, and future development.}},

Abstract = {{For inertial loading in frontal impacts, the effects of the neck muscles
   are profound, and impact the accuracy of computational and physical
   surrogates. Previous studies have shown two important aspects of muscle
   modeling in adult computational models are muscle attachment location
   and muscle loading lines of action. The objective of the current study
   was to evaluate techniques for modeling muscle curvature in adult
   computational neck muscles using data from cadaveric dissections and
   MRI, and to investigate the changes in overall head/neck response when
   using different muscle wrapping techniques. Dissection based muscle
   paths were modeled using multiple linear muscle strands, which resulted
   in curved loading lines of action similar to the MRI derived muscle
   paths. Six of the 12 muscles had a portion of their paths, (on average
   25 +/- 14\% of the path length), that were significantly different from
   the MRI derived paths. Muscles that incorporated muscle wrapping with
   sliding contact interactions resulted in the highest correlation to
   volunteer kinematic corridors in a 15 G frontal impact. This curvilinear
   muscle response should be included to improve model response for frontal
   impact with muscle activation.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial stiffness is an important clinical indicator of cardiac
   function. One of the contributors to stiffness in the heart is coronary
   perfusion. The interaction between cardiac tissue and coronary
   vasculature has been studied for several decades using pressure-volume
   loop measurements. Recently, developments in elastography methods have
   enabled researchers to study the mechanical properties of tissues from a
   distance. Among them, Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging
   utilizes an acoustic pulse to push the tissue and ultrasound tracking to
   measure the resulting displacement. M-mode ARFI was used in this work to
   investigate the effect of coronary perfusion on cardiac stiffness. In
   six isolated Langendorff perfused rabbit hearts, we investigated the
   effect on myocardial stiffness of a perfusion pressure reduction from
   normal to half-normal. The acute decrease in coronary perfusion
   decreases the stiffness of the heart in systole and diastole (Gregg and
   garden-hose effects respectively). As the coronary perfusion was reduced
   from normal to half-normal, the average M-mode ARFI displacements for
   all the subjects increased from 5.1 +/- 2.2 mu m (mean +/- standard
   deviation) to 9.7 +/- 3.7 mu m in systole and 24.5 +/- 8.9 mu m to 35.2
   +/- 9.1 mu m in diastole (p < 0.05). These results are consistent with
   the Gregg and garden-hose effects reported by researchers using other
   measurement methods. Despite complicated issues regarding attenuation,
   anisotropy, and viscoelasticity, ARFI can be used to study relative or
   acute changes in cardiac function and myocardial stiffness.}},

   associated with preterm birth. The purpose of this study is to compare
   shear wave speed (SWS) estimates in the ex vivo non-pregnant and in vivo
   third trimester pregnant cervix and to discuss confounding factors that
   may influence comparisons of SWS estimates. Ex vivo hysterectomy samples
   (n = 22) were collected and a subset were ripened (softened) (n = 13).
   Multiple SWS measurements were made longitudinally along the cervical
   canal at 4-5 locations on both anterior and posterior halves of the
   bivalved cervix. For the in vivo study, patients (n = 10) undergoing
   cervical ripening for induction of labor were recruited. SWS
   measurements were made on the same patient with the probe placed on the
   anterior half of the cervix at mid-length between the internal and
   external os. Ten replicate SWS measurements were made before and 4 hours
   after a cervical ripening agent (misoprostol) was administered.
   Statistical analysis was performed to determine significance of
   differences in SWS as a result of ripening. The SWS estimates for the
   mid-length anterior position for the ex vivo study were 3.42 +/- 0.92
   m/s and 2.06 +/- 0.39 m/s for unripened and ripened, respectively.
   Similarly, the SWS estimates for the in vivo third trimester pregnant
   cervix were 2.40 +/- 0.75 m/s and 1.54 +/- 0.31 m/s pre- and
   post-ripening. Factors such as bivalving the ex vivo specimens,
   differences in tissue temperature, and tissue perfusion likely affect
   SWS estimates, but similar similar trends were found.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging tools that reliably visualize prostate cancer (PCa) are
   increasingly needed in the urological community. The objective of this
   research was to evaluate the ability of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse
   (ARFI) imaging to localize PCa in 29 patients with biopsy-confirmed PCa
   who underwent radical prostatectomy and whole mount histopathology
   analysis. B-mode, ARFI imaging and whole mount histopathology volumes
   were acquired for each patient. Regions of suspicion (ROS) for PCa were
   reader-identified in ARFI images based on boundary delineation,
   contrast, texture and location, and compared to lesions identified in
   histopathology. ARFI imaging identified a total of 29 ROSs, 27 of which
   were correctly identified as cancer (PPV: 93\%). ARFI imaging's overall
   sensitivity was 55\%; however, there was significant variation in
   sensitivity depending on lesion type. We found that ARFI imaging was
   much more sensitive to posterior lesions (63\%) than anterior lesions
   (12.5\%). Posterior index lesions were identified with greater
   sensitivity (81\%) than clinically-insignificant lesions (33\%).}},

Abstract = {{Power Doppler imaging is widely used in clinics for flow detection.
   However, its ability and sensitivity in slow flow detection is limited
   by thermal noise and clutter. In addition, its frame rate is limited due
   to the need for a large number of ensembles to obtain sufficient
   sensitivity in flow detection. Such a need may also result in flash
   artifacts during moderate tissue motion. We propose an alternative
   method of flow detection using the spatial coherence of backscatterred
   ultrasound echoes. The method produces similar or better signal quality
   of conventional power Doppler techniques, but enhances slow flow
   detection and frame rate. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method
   with both simulations and an in-vivo human thyroid study. The results
   are compared with conventional power Doppler slow-flow detection. It is
   shown that this method can detect approximately 30\% slower flow than
   conventional power Doppler, or improves the frame rate by a factor of 3
   without loss of image quality.}},

Abstract = {{Short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) imaging, a coherence-based
   alternative beamforming technique, creates images related to the spatial
   covariance in backscatter. Because spatial covariance estimation is a
   computationally intensive process, efficient techniques are crucial to
   implementing SLSC imaging in real-time. Sparse sampling methods that
   take advantage of the statistical properties of spatial covariance of
   backscatter may yield adequate images at substantially faster rates.
   Among a variety of sparse spatial sampling techniques, a uniformly
   spaced sampling scheme was found to generate SLSC images with highest
   fidelity. Nearly identical images could be formed using a small fraction
   (17\%) of the aperture, corresponding to a 97.3\% reduction in the
   number of covariance computations. Furthermore, sparse temporal sampling
   was implemented by replacing the axial kernel of length T (used to
   compute covariance) with a single sample, and yielded SLSC images with
   improved axial resolution with a T-fold reduction in computation time.
   The two techniques were combined to obtain even further improvements in
   computation speed with little or no image degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) has found success in liver fibrosis
   staging. However, technical failure and unreliable shear wave speed
   (SWS) estimation have been reported to increase both with elevated
   patient body mass index (BMI) and in the presence of significant hepatic
   fibrosis. Elevated BMI results in a significant amount of subcutaneous
   fat which attenuates acoustic radiation force (ARF) and abberates
   tracking beams. Advanced fibrosis results in small displacement
   amplitudes in stiff livers. This work evaluates hepatic SWEI measurement
   success as a function of push pulse energy using 2 Mechanical Index (MI)
   values (1.6 and 2.2) over a range of pulse durations. The rate of
   successful SWS estimation for 8 repeated measurements is linearly
   proportional to the push energy level. As expected, elevated push energy
   in SWEI measurements results in higher displacement signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR). SWEI measurements with elevated push energy are successful
   in patients for whom standard push energy levels failed. Deep liver
   capsule is shown to be an indicator for lower yield of SWS estimation.
   Patients with deep liver capsules are likely to benefit from elevated
   push energies. We conclude that there is clinical benefit to using
   elevated acoustic output for hepatic SWS measurement in ``difficult to
   image{''} patients.}},

Abstract = {{Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) has become increasingly popular to
   non-invasively characterize liver fibrosis. Generating adequate shear
   wave displacements in human liver in vivo can be challenging, especially
   in the high Body Mass Index (BMI) population being evaluated for
   Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Technical approaches to
   improve ARF-induced displacements include (1) using more aggressive
   focal configurations to generate higher peak force amplitudes, and (2)
   increasing the duration of the acoustic radiation force excitation.
   Using finite element method (FEM) models of Gaussian ARF excitations of
   varying spatial extent and temporal duration, we have demonstrated that
   shear wave velocity spectra are affected by both the spatial
   distribution and temporal duration of acoustic radiation force shear
   wave excitation sources. Shear wave spectra can be affected by the ARF
   spatial extent in the orthogonal dimension, which can be important when
   lateral: elevation excitation beamwidth anisotropies exist as a function
   of depth. Shear wave spectral content differences in different stiffness
   media are minimized for tightly-focused ARF excitations when using
   longer excitation durations, decreasing from similar to 60\% for 100 mu
   s excitations to similar to 10\% for 1.5 ms excitations. These absolute
   and relative differences are significantly reduced for broader
   excitations. We have demonstrated similar trends experimentally using
   tissue-mimicking phantoms.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate displacement estimation can be a challenging task in acoustic
   radiation force elastography, where signal decorrelation can degrade the
   ability of a normalized cross-correlation (NCC) estimator to
   characterize the tissue response. In this work, we describe a Bayesian
   estimation scheme which models both signal decorrelation and thermal
   noise, and uses an edge-preserving, generalized Gaussian Markov random
   field prior. The performance of the estimator was evaluated in FEM
   simulations modeling the acoustic radiation force impulse response in a
   linearly-isotropic material. Bias, variance, and mean-square error were
   calculated over a range of estimator parameters, and compared to NCC.
   The results demonstrate that a significant reduction in mean-square
   error can be achieved with the proposed estimator. Finally, in vivo data
   of an radio-frequency ablation in a canine model are shown,
   demonstrating the in vivo feasibility of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Reflected waves from stiffness boundaries can lead to artifacts in shear
   wave speed ( SWS) reconstructions. 2D directional filters are commonly
   used with planar imaging systems to reduce in-plane reflected waves;
   however SWS artifacts arise from both in and out-of imaging plane
   reflected waves. Herein, we quantify the reduction in image artifacts
   afforded by the use of volumetric SWS monitoring and 4D directional
   filters. A Gaussian acoustic radiation force impulse was simulated in a
   phantom with a Young's modulus (E) of 3 kPa with a 5 mm spherical lesion
   with E = 6, 12 or 18.75 kPa. 2D, 3D, and 4D directional filters were
   applied to the displacement profiles to reduce in and out-of-plane
   reflected wave artifacts. SWS images were reconstructed and RMS error
   and CNR were calculated for each image to evaluate the image accuracy
   and quality. Applying 3D directional filters as compared to 2D led to
   larger improvements in image accuracy and quality than the improvements
   seen using 4D directional filters over 3D. This improvement in image
   accuracy is significant because the processing of these data could be
   performed on displacement data from a traditional 1D linear array with
   reasonable computational time and resources. Although 4D directional
   filters can further reduce the impact of large magnitude out-of-plane
   reflection artifacts in SWS images, computational overhead and
   transducer costs may outweigh the modest improvements in image quality.}},

Abstract = {{Phase aberration is the distortion of the diffraction pattern when a
   wave propagates in a medium with an inhomogeneous sound speed. In this
   study, the accuracy of the estimation of backscatter coefficients (BSCs)
   in the presence of near-field phase aberrations was studied through
   simulations. Further, the accuracy was also evaluated when using two
   different phase aberration correction strategies prior to BSC
   estimation. Simulations were performed using the FIELD II software for
   pulsed ultrasound field calculation. The simulation utilized a 45
   element, 3.5 MHz linear array with 70\% bandwidth. The imaging medium
   consisted of randomly positioned circular scatterers having a diameter
   of 176 microns. Near field phase aberrators were applied to the transmit
   and receive signals of the simulation having 50, 75, and 100 ns RMS
   strength and a 3 mm correlation length. Phase aberrations were estimated
   using a multi-lag least squares estimation technique. BSCs were
   estimated using the reference phantom method and radiofrequency data
   segments with a length of 14 wavelengths and centered around the
   transducer transmit focus. BSC estimation accuracy was quantified using
   the average difference in dB between the theoretical and estimated
   curves within the -10 dB bandwidth of the transducer. The mean BSC
   estimation errors were -9.31, -12.82 and -15.58 dB in the presence of
   the 50, 75 and 100 ns aberrators, respectively. The use of aberration
   correction on receive was inadequate for the BSC accuracy for all three
   cases. The estimation errors for the 50 ns, 75 ns and 100 ns aberrators
   were -7.24, -12.66 dB and -14.68 dB, respectively. In contrast, the use
   of aberration correction on transmit-receive allowed an accurate BSC
   estimation, with estimation errors lower than 0.7 dB for the first two
   cases. These results suggest that phase aberration effects may adversely
   influence the performance of BSC estimation, and that a robust BSC-based
   tissue characterization may require compensating for the effects of
   aberration on both transmit and receive beams.}},

Abstract = {{Mouse models are widely used in studies of various forms of transcranial
   electric stimulation (TES). However, there is limited knowledge of the
   electric field distribution induced by TES in mice, and computational
   models to estimate this distribution are lacking. This study examines
   the electric field and current density distribution in the mouse brain
   induced by TES. We created a high-resolution finite element mouse model
   incorporating ear clip electrodes commonly used in mouse TES to study,
   for example, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The electric field
   strength and current density induced by an ear clip electrode
   configuration were computed in the anatomically realistic, inhomogenous
   mouse model. The results show that the median electric field strength
   induced in the brain at 1 mA of stimulus current is 5.57 V/m, and the
   strongest field of 20.19 V/m was observed in the cerebellum. Therefore,
   to match the median electric field in human ECT at 800 mA current, the
   electrode current in mouse should be set to approximately 15 mA.
   However, the location of the strongest electric field in posterior brain
   regions in the mouse does not model well human ECT which targets more
   frontal regions. Therefore, the ear clip electrode configuration may not
   be a good model of human ECT. Using high-resolution realistic models for
   simulating TES in mice may guide the establishment of appropriate
   stimulation parameters for future in vivo studies.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of measuring cardiac function noninvasively has
   generated wide interest in elastography imaging techniques. Shear Wave
   Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) is an ultrasound-based elastography technique
   used to measure stiffness of tissues. While this technique has been
   studied extensively in static homogenous tissues such as liver, breast
   or prostate, there is still a significant need to study its capabilities
   to measure cardiac stiffness and function. In this research, we have
   studied the potential of SWEI to evaluate the coronary perfusion
   pressure effect on systolic and diastolic stiffness referred to as
   elastance and compliance of the heart. Five isolated rabbit hearts were
   used in this study in a Langendorff preparation. SWEI measurements of
   stiffness were recorded in two steps. In the first step, coronary
   perfusion was set to normal and then was reduced to half-normal. After
   40 minutes of half-normal perfusion, it was returned to normal perfusion
   for the second step. SWEI velocity decreased from 6.003 m/s to 4.713 m/s
   in systole and from 1.948 m/s to 1.507 m/s in diastole in the first
   step. During the second step raising the perfusion to normal, SWEI
   stiffness showed an increase from 3.760 m/s to 5.468 m/s in systole and
   from 1.678 m/s to 2.156 m/s during diastole. Our results show that SWEI
   measurements of stiffness can characterize the cross talk between
   coronary perfusion and cardiac stiffness and also has the potential to
   measure compliance and elastance of the heart in systole and diastole.}},

Abstract = {{Rodent models are valuable for preclinical examination of novel
   therapeutic techniques, including transcranial magnetic stimulation
   (TMS). However, comparison of TMS effects in rodents and humans is
   confounded by inaccurate scaling of the spatial extent of the induced
   electric field in rodents. The electric field is substantially less
   focal in rodent models of TMS due to the technical restrictions of
   making very small coils that can handle the currents required for TMS.
   We examine the electric field distributions generated by various
   electrode configurations of electric stimulation in an inhomogeneous
   high-resolution finite element mouse model, and show that the electric
   field distributions produced by human TMS can be approximated by
   electric stimulation in mouse. Based on these results and the limits of
   magnetic stimulation in mice, we argue that the most practical and
   accurate way to model focal TMS in mice is electric stimulation through
   either cortical surface electrodes or electrodes implanted halfway
   through the mouse cranium. This approach could allow much more accurate
   approximation of the human TMS electric field focality and strength than
   that offered by TMS in mouse, enabling, for example, focal targeting of
   specific cortical regions, which is common in human TMS paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{The tutorial offers attendees an opportunity to bridge the semiconductor
   ICs/system industry with the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.
   The tutorial will first describe emerging applications in biology and
   biochemistry that can benefit from advances in electronic
   ``biochips{''}. The presenters will next describe technology platforms
   for accomplishing ``biochemistry on a chip{''}, and introduce the
   audience to both the droplet-based ``digital{''} microfluidics based on
   electrowetting actuation and flow-based ``continuous{''} microfluidics
   based on microvalve technology. Next, the presenters will describe
   system-level synthesis includes operation scheduling and resource
   binding algorithms, and physical-level synthesis includes placement and
   routing optimizations. In this way, the audience will see how a
   ``biochip compiler{''} can translate protocol descriptions provided by
   an end user (e.g., a chemist or a nurse at a doctor's clinic) to a set
   of optimized and executable fluidic instructions that will run on the
   underlying microfluidic platform. Testing techniques will be described
   to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. A
   classification of defects will be presented based on data for fabricated
   chips. Appropriately fault models will be developed and presented to the
   audience. On-line and off-line reconfiguration techniques will be
   presented to bypass faults once they are detected. The problem of
   mapping a small number of chip pins to a large number of array
   electrodes will also be covered. Finally, sensor feedback-based
   cyberphysical adaptation will be covered. A number of case studies based
   on representative assays and laboratory procedures will be interspersed
   in appropriate places throughout the tutorial.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to identify and evaluate various critical mechanisms
   associated with the processes of desiccation shrinkage in drying silty
   soils. A previously developed 1D bundle-of-tubes model is refined to
   simulate the various stages of drying shrinkage in 2D using the actual
   pore size distribution based on Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP)
   data. It is revealed that the resulting shrinkage evolution is affected
   by air entry that may occur in two possible scenarios: air incursion at
   the external surface and formation of vapor nucleus in the interior. The
   analysis of mechanical deformation is coupled with the numerical
   simulation of the drying process which can be often characterized as a
   two-stage development, consisting of a constant rate period and a
   falling rate period. Numerical simulation of the drying rate evolution
   suggests that it may be closely associated with the onset of air entry
   and/or the progress of desaturation. Further transition of solid-water
   structural configuration into funicular and pendular states from
   initially capillary state is simulated.}},

Abstract = {{The standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework assumes a
   stationary (or at least predictable) environment. Online learning
   algorithms can deal with non-stationary or unpredictable environments,
   but there is no notion of a state that might be changing throughout the
   learning process as a function of past actions. In recent years, there
   has been a growing interest in combining the above two frameworks and
   considering an MDP setting, where the cost function is allowed to change
   arbitrarily after each time step. However, most of the work in this area
   has been algorithmic: given a problem, one would design an algorithm
   from scratch and analyze its performance on a case-by-case basis.
   Moreover, the presence of the state and the assumption of an arbitrarily
   varying environment complicate both the theoretical analysis and the
   development of computationally efficient methods. This paper builds on
   recent results of Rakhlin et al. to give a general framework for
   deriving algorithms in an MDP setting with arbitrarily changing costs.
   This framework leads to a unifying view of existing methods and provides
   a general procedure for constructing new ones.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the spectrum leasing in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN)
   based on property-right model is addressed when a single Primary User
   (PU) coexists with multiple Secondary Users (SU). In this model, the PU
   as the spectrum owner allows the SU to use a portion of the spectrum
   band in exchange for providing cooperative relaying service. We propose
   a novel game theoretic model, where the PU is able to monitor the
   behavior of the SUs in terms of cooperation. Using the proposed
   credit-based mechanism, the PU will be notified about any dishonest
   action of the SUs after they utilized the spectrum access, therefore the
   PU may decide not to select the fraudulent SUs in the next time slots.
   The proposed accumulative cooperative credit keeps the record of the
   portion of power is used by each SU to perform the relaying service. In
   each round, the PU observes the SUs' credit and selects a reliable one
   with a relatively good channel condition.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past several decades, there has been an ever-increasing demand
   for organ transplants. However, there is a severe shortage of donor
   organs, and as a result of the increasing demand, the gap between supply
   and demand continues to widen. A potential solution to this problem is
   to grow or fabricate organs using biomaterial scaffolds and a person's
   own cells. Although the realization of this solution has been limited,
   the development of new biofabrication approaches has made it more
   realistic. This review provides an overview of natural and synthetic
   biomaterials that have been used for organ/tissue development. It then
   discusses past and current biofabrication techniques, with a brief
   explanation of the state of the art. Finally, the review highlights the
   need for combining vascularization strategies with current
   biofabrication techniques. Given the multitude of applications of
   biofabrication technologies, from organ/tissue development to drug
   discovery/screening to development of complex in vitro models of human
   diseases, these manufacturing technologies can have a significant impact

Abstract = {{Inhibiting specific gene expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA)
   offers a new therapeutic strategy to tackle many diseases, including
   cancer, metabolic disorders, and viral infections, at the molecular
   level. The macromolecular and polar nature of siRNA hinders its cellular
   access to exert its effect. Nanoparticulate delivery systems can promote
   efficient intracellular delivery. Despite showing promise in many
   preclinical studies and potential in some clinical trials, siRNA has
   poor delivery efficiency, which continues to demand innovations, from
   carrier design to formulation, in order to overcome transport barriers.
   Previous findings for optimal plasmid DNA delivery cannot be generalized
   to siRNA delivery owing to significant discrepancy in size and subtle
   differences in chain flexibility between the two types of nucleic acids.
   In this review, we highlight the recent advances in improving the

Abstract = {{Codes for storage systems aim to minimize the repair locality, which is
   the number of disks (or nodes) that participate in the repair of a
   single failed disk. Simultaneously, the code must sustain a high rate,
   operate on a small finite field to be practically significant and be
   tolerant to a large number of erasures. To this end, we construct new
   families of binary linear codes that have an optimal dimension (rate)
   for a given minimum distance and locality. Specifically, we construct
   cyclic codes that are locally repairable for locality 2 and distances 2,
   6 and 10. In doing so, we discover new upper bounds on the code
   dimension, and prove the optimality of enabling local repair by
   provisioning disjoint groups of disks. Finally, we extend our
   construction to build codes that have multiple repair sets for each
   disk.}},

   fundamental limits on the reliable classification of high-dimensional
   signals from low-dimensional features. We focus on the classification of
   linear and affine subspaces and suppose the features to be noisy linear
   projections. Leveraging a syntactic equivalence of discrimination
   between subspaces and communications over vector wireless channels, we
   derive asymptotic bounds on classifier performance. First, we define the
   classification capacity, which characterizes necessary and sufficient
   relationships between the signal dimension, the number of features, and
   the number of classes to be discriminated, as all three quantities
   approach infinity. Second, we define the diversity-discrimination
   tradeoff, which characterizes relationships between the number of
   classes and the misclassification probability as the signal-to-noise
   ratio approaches infinity. We derive inner and outer bounds on these
   measures, revealing precise relationships between signal dimension and

   This paper considers the extent to which such recovery is robust to
   signal and measurement uncertainty. The main result is a non-asymptotic
   upper bound on the reconstruction error in terms of two key quantities:
   the best approximation error of the signal (with respect to a
   user-defined approximation set) and the measurement error. We assume a
   random Gaussian sensing matrix but place no restrictions on the signal
   or the noise. This result provides a simple and yet powerful framework
   for analyzing the fundamental limits of stable recovery, allowing us to
   sharpen existing results as well as derive new ones.}},

Title = {{Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Device With Reduced Acoustic Noise}},
Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used for noninvasive
   activation of neurons in the brain for research and clinical
   applications. The strong, brief magnetic pulse generated in TMS is
   associated with a loud (>100 dB) clicking sound that can impair hearing
   and that activates auditory circuits in the brain. We introduce a
   two-pronged solution to reduce TMS noise by redesigning both the pulse
   waveform and the coil structure. First, the coil current pulse duration
   is reduced which shifts a substantial portion of the pulse acoustic
   spectrum above audible frequencies. Second, the mechanical structure of
   the stimulation coil is designed to suppress the emergence of the sound
   at the source, diminish down-mixing of high-frequency sound into the
   audible range, and impede the transmission of residual sound to the coil
   surface but dissipate it away from the casing. A prototype coil driven
   with ultrabrief current pulses (down to 45-mu s biphasic duration) is
   demonstrated to reduce the peak sound pressure level by more than 25 dB
   compared to a conventional TMS configuration, resulting in loudness
   reduction by more than 14-fold. These results motivate improved
   mechanical design of TMS coils as well as design of TMS pulse generators
   with shorter pulse durations and increased voltage limits with the
   objective of reducing TMS acoustic noise while retaining the
   neurostimulation strength.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of hypovolemia in the early stages of hemorrhage is an
   important but unsolved problem in medicine. Many preventable deaths
   amongst critically injured patients happen due to delayed treatment of
   uncontrolled hemorrhage. Using a database of physiological signals
   collected during simulated hemorrhage on human subjects, our research
   applies a variety of signal processing techniques to extract a multitude
   of features that enable the prediction of the severity of hemorrhage. In
   this study, a novel feature selection method based on coalition game
   theory has been proposed which helps identify the most valuable features
   and thereby reduce the size of the feature space. This reduction in
   feature space not only improves the efficiency, but also improves the
   prediction accuracy and reliability of the developed model. This feature
   selection algorithm is independent of the underlying classification
   method and can be combined with any classification method based on the
   employed data. The proposed feature selection method significantly
   enhances the prediction accuracy by optimally selecting the features
   compared to the state of the art.}},

Abstract = {{We consider grouping as a general characterization for problems such as
   clustering, community detection in networks, and multiple parametric
   model estimation. We are interested in merging solutions from different
   grouping algorithms, distilling all their good qualities into a
   consensus solution. In this paper, we propose a biclustering framework
   and perspective for reaching consensus in such grouping problems. In
   particular, this is the first time that the task of finding/fitting
   multiple parametric models to a dataset is formally posed as a consensus
   problem. We highlight the equivalence of these tasks and establish the
   connection with the computational Gestalt program, which seeks to
   provide a psychologically inspired detection theory for visual events.
   We also present a simple but powerful biclustering algorithm, specially
   tuned to the nature of the problem we address, though general enough to
   handle many different instances inscribed within our characterization.
   The presentation is accompanied with diverse and extensive experimental
   results in clustering, community detection, and multiple parametric

Abstract = {{The performance of synthesis pattern with sparse arrays is known to
   degrade in the presence of errors in the array manifolds. This paper
   introduces a beampattern synthesis approach with uncertain manifold
   vectors perturbation for linear array. In order to match the desired
   pattern and minimize the elements simultaneously, the convex
   optimization of minimizing a reweighted l(1) -norm objective based on
   the weights of elements is proposed. The superposition sampling is used
   for select the elements. The excitation weights and sensor positions of
   an array radiating pencil beampatterns are obtained. This method is
   demonstrated through numerical simulations. The results show the
   maximally sparse array in beampattern synthesis with manifold vectors
   perturbation is obtained and the method is effective.}},

   compressive sensing (CS) is utilized for impulse borehole radar (IBR).
   With the sparse transform we present for the IBR systems, only 50\% or

   reconstruct the target space. It reduces the required sampling rate and
   data transmission rate of IBR systems. Moreover, the simulation and

Abstract = {{For subsurface sensing objects using electromagnetic waves, most of
   current imaging methods need priori information of exact dielectric
   properties of background media in order to accurately reconstruct the
   concealed targets. This condition is hardly satisfied in practice.
   Recently, an efficiently qualitative imaging method termed
   electromagnetic inverse scattering series method (EISSM) is developed to
   image the buried targets. EISSM reconstructs concealed targets in the
   layered media by only utilizing dielectric properties of free space.
   However, the effects of frequency information to the EISSM have never
   been discussed. In this paper, we analyze and discuss the effects of
   frequency information to the performance of EISSM when imaging the
   buried objects. Through some numerical simulations, EISSM can obtain
   favorable image results with a broad frequency spectrum of measured
   data.}},

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with large-scale three-dimensional inversion
   under transient elastodynamic conditions by means of the modified error
   in constitutive relation (MECR), an energy-based cost functional. A
   peculiarity of time-domain MECR formulations is that each evaluation
   involves the computation of two elastodynamic states (one forward, one
   backward) which moreover are coupled. This coupling creates a major
   computational bottleneck, making MECR-based inversion difficult for
   spatially 2D or 3D configurations. To overcome this obstacle, we propose
   an approach whose main ingredients are (a) setting the entire
   computational procedure in a consistent time-discrete framework that
   incorporates the chosen time-stepping algorithm, and (b) using an
   iterative SOR-like method for the resulting stationarity equations. The
   resulting MECR-based inversion algorithm is demonstrated on a 3D
   transient elastodynamic example involving over 500,000 unknown elastic
   moduli.}},

Abstract = {{Vacuum devices are preferred to solid-state for applications requiring

   integrating these devices on the microscale have limited their
   development. We describe a monolithic vacuum microelectronic integration
   platform based on freestanding polysilicon MEMS devices with integrated
   carbon nanotube (CNT) field emitters. A four panel vacuum microtriode
   consisting of a cathode, extraction grid, control grid, and anode is
   being developed as the key active circuit component of the platform. We
   also describe efforts to develop cathodes with sufficient emission
   stability and lifetime for practical circuit implementation. Lifetime of
   CNT-based cathodes is being optimized through use of multilayer
   catalysts and CNT coating processes. This platform has the potential to
   enable high performance, integrated vacuum microelectronic circuits

Abstract = {{It is well known that the conventional edge element method in solving
   vector Maxwell's eigenvalue problem will lead to the presence of
   nonphysical zero eigenvalues. This paper uses the mixed finite element
   method to suppress the presence of these nonphysical zero eigenvalues
   for 2D vector Maxwell's eigenvalue problem in anisotropic media. We
   introduce a Lagrangian multiplier to deal with the constraint of
   divergence-free condition. Our method is based on employing the
   first-order edge element basis functions to expand the electric field
   and linear nodal element basis functions to expand the Lagrangian
   multiplier. Our numerical experiments show that this method can
   successfully remove all nonphysical zero and nonzero eigenvalues. We
   verify that when the cavity has a connected perfect electric boundary,
   then there is no physical zero eigenvalue. Otherwise, the number of
   physical zero eigenvalues is one less than the number of disconnected
   perfect electric boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Chitin of poriferan origin is a unique and thermostable biological
   material. It also represents an example of a renewable materials source
   due to the high regeneration ability of Aplysina sponges under marine
   ranching conditions. Chitinous scaffolds isolated from the skeleton of
   the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba were used as a template for the in
   vitro formation of Fe2O3 under conditions (pH similar to 1.5, 90 degrees
   C) which are extreme for biological materials. Novel chitin-Fe2O3 three
   dimensional composites, which have been prepared for the first time
   using hydrothermal synthesis, were thoroughly characterized using
   numerous analytical methods including Raman spectroscopy, XPS, XRD,
   electron diffraction and HR-TEM. We demonstrate the growth of uniform
   Fe2O3 nanocrystals into the nanostructured chitin substrate and propose
   a possible mechanism of chitin-hematite interactions. Moreover, we show
   that composites made of sponge chitin-Fe2O3 hybrid materials with active
   carbon can be successfully used as electrode materials for
   electrochemical capacitors.}},

Abstract = {{Given an universe of distinct, low-level communities of a network, we
   aim at identifying the ``meaningful{''} and consistent communities in
   this universe. We address this as the process of obtaining consensual
   community detections and formalize it as a bi-clustering problem. While
   most consensus algorithms only take into account pairwise relations and
   end up analyzing a huge matrix, our proposed characterization of the
   consensus problem (1) does not drop useful information, and (2) analyzes
   a much smaller matrix, rendering the problem tractable for large
   networks. We also propose a new parameterless bi-clustering algorithm,
   fit for the type of matrices we analyze. The approach has proven
   successful in a very diverse set of experiments, ranging from unifying
   the results of multiple community detection algorithms to finding common
   communities from multi-modal or noisy networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of RF-based wide-area human motion
   monitoring in indoor multipath environments. A major challenge for
   conventional pulse-Doppler radar in multipath scenarios is the
   difficulty in discriminating direct-path targets from ghost returns due

   multiple-output (MIMO) RF probe to discern both direction-of-departure
   (DoD) and direction-of-arrival (DoA) via ``non-causal{''} beamforming is
   exploited for indoor motion monitoring. Preliminary results with real
   data are presented which demonstrate the sidelobe suppression and
   multipath mitigation achieved. Also, MIMO processing is analyzed using
   the bi-directional beampattern and spectrum defined herein.}},

Abstract = {{Re-identification refers to the problem of recognizing a person at a
   different location after one has been captured by a camera at a previous
   location. We discuss re-identification of faces using the domain
   adaptation approach which tackles the problem where data in the target
   domain (different location) are drawn from a different distribution as
   the source domain (previous location), due to different view points,
   illumination conditions, resolutions, etc. In particular, we discuss the
   adaptation of dictionary-based methods for re-identification of faces.
   We first present a domain adaptive dictionary learning (DADL) framework
   for the task of transforming a dictionary learned from one visual domain
   to the other, while maintaining a domain-invariant sparse representation
   of a signal. Domain dictionaries are modeled by a linear or nonlinear
   parametric function. The dictionary function parameters and
   domain-invariant sparse codes are then jointly learned by solving an
   optimization problem. We then discuss an unsupervised domain adaptive
   dictionary learning (UDADL) method where labeled data are only available
   in the source domain. We propose to interpolate subspaces through
   dictionary learning to link the source and target domains. These
   subspaces are able to capture the intrinsic domain shift and form a
   shared feature representation for cross-domain identification.}},

Abstract = {{There is increased interest in the interplay between vegetation
   conditions and overland flow generation. The literature is unclear on
   this relationship, and there is little quantitative guidance for
   modeling efforts. Therefore, experimental efforts are needed, and these
   call for a lightweight transportable plot-scale (> 10 m(2)) rainfall
   simulator that can be deployed quickly and quickly redeployed over
   various vegetation cover conditions. Accordingly, a variable-intensity
   rainfall simulator and collection system was designed and tested in the
   laboratory and in the field. The system was tested with three
   configurations of common pressure washing nozzles producing rainfall
   intensities of 62, 43, and 32 mm h(-1) with uniformity coefficients of
   76, 65, and 62 \%, respectively, over a plot of 15.12 m(2). Field tests
   were carried out on a grassy field with silt-loam soil in Orroli,
   Sardinia, in July and August 2010, and rainfall, soil moisture, and
   runoff data were collected. The two-term Philip infiltration model was
   used to find optimal values for the saturated hydraulic conductivity of
   the soil surface and bulk soil, soil water retention curve slope, and
   air entry suction head. Optimized hydraulic conductivity values were
   similar to both the measured final infiltration rate and literature
   values for saturated hydraulic conductivity. This inexpensive (less than
   USD 1000) rainfall simulator can therefore be used to identify field
   parameters needed for hydrologic modeling.}},

   pyrolysis and carbon reduction. Then recent patents and articles on
   surface modification and functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles
   using polymers, dithiocarbamate, superparamagnetic shells, antibodies,
   graphene shells, and fluorescent materials are reviewed. Finally,
   different techniques on magnetic cell manipulation, such as direct

Abstract = {{Proteins are heteropolymers of one or more amino acid residues arranged
   in a molecularly defined fashion. The precise control of amino acid
   sequence in protein biosynthesis programs the folding of these
   heteropolymers into diverse three-dimensional structures. The language
   of proteins, however, as seen in nature, encompasses limitless amino
   acid ``phrases{''} (heteropolyrners) written in peptide ``words{''}
   (amino acid motifs) that span the entire structural spectrum from
   tightly folded to unstructured. Because protein sequences do not always
   have an obvious syntactic unit (word), herein we focus on protein
   polymers that repeat one or more syntactic units-motifs with a
   characteristic fold, biological activity or physical property (e.g.,
   elasticity, phase behavior). We review the biosynthesis and
   sequence-controlled behavior of protein polymers that altogether span
   the gap between folded proteins and unstructured polymers. Learning to
   speak the language of protein polymers promises to merge the science of
   protein design and the materials science of synthetic polymers.
   Paradoxically, while protein structure is largely foreign to polymer
   chemists, the study and synthesis of unstructured, polymer-like proteins
   has been-till recently-similarly foreign to structural biologists.
   Interesting possibilities in materials science emerge from acquiring the
   capacity to read, write and speak the language of protein polymers.}},

   applying both small and large stochastic perturbations to steady-state
   behavior, it is possible to interrogate the initial condition space and

   flit to multiple destination ports simultaneously, we present two
   methods to minimize time to test cores in a homogeneous SOC with many

   in terms of integer linear programming. Next, we add a practical
   constraint, model the constrained problem in terms of grid partitioning,
   and apply dynamic programming (DP) to optimally solve it. We present
   results on synthetic NOC-based SOCs constructed using cores from the
   ITC'02 benchmarks to show that the proposed methods significantly

Abstract = {{Ground Penetrating radar (GPR) is a commonly used modality for the
   detection of buried threats. This work explores two approaches for
   buried threat detection in GPR data that we refer to as the hyperbolic
   filter and PLSDA filter algorithms. The hyperbolic filter algorithm
   leverages the hyperbolic shape of buried threat GPR responses, while the
   PLSDA algorithm uses a PLSDA linear classifier to learn a filter based
   on classifier weights. A hyperbolic filter is trained and optimized by
   doing a grid search over a set of hyperbola parameters. The PLSDA filter
   is generated by aligning GPR data and training PLSDA weights on that
   feature space. The correlation between each filter and the 2D GPR data
   provides information regarding the presence of buried threats. The PLSDA
   and hyperbolic filters were generated for a data set containing multiple
   target types. Both PLSDA and hyperbolic filters outperformed a
   prescreener for target subsets, and performed similarly over all target
   types. Relative to one another, both PLSDA and hyperbolic filters
   performed equally well. PLSDA filters, however, can be trained much
   faster than the corresponding exhaustive search needed by the hyperbolic
   filter.}},

Abstract = {{A recently validated technique for buried target detection relies on
   applying an acoustic stimulus signal to a patch of earth and then
   measuring its seismic (vibrational) response using a laser Doppler
   vibrometer (LDV). Target detection in this modality often relies on
   estimating the acoustic-to-seismic coupling ratio (A/S ratio) of the
   ground, which is altered by the presence of a buried target. For this
   study, LDV measurements were collected over patches of earth under
   varying environmental conditions using a known stimulus. These
   observations are then used to estimate the performance of several
   methods to discriminate between target and non-target patches. The first
   part of the study compares the performance of human observers against a
   set of established seismo-acoustic features from the literature. The
   simple features are based on previous studies where statistics on the
   Fourier transform of the acoustic-to-seismic transfer function estimate
   are measured. The human observers generally offered much better
   detection performance than any established feature. One weakness of the
   Fourier features is their inability to utilize local spatiotemporal
   target cues. To address these weaknesses, a novel automatic detection
   algorithm is proposed which uses a multi-scale blob detector to identify
   suspicious regions in time and space. These suspicious spatiotemporal
   locations are then clustered and assigned a decision statistic based on
   the confidence and number of cluster members. This method is shown to
   improve performance over the established Fourier statistics, resulting
   in performance much closer to the human observers.}},

Abstract = {{Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a popular sensing modality for buried
   threat detection that offers low false alarm rates (FARs), but suffers
   from a short detection stopping or standoff distance. This short
   stopping distance leaves little time for the system operator to react
   when a threat is detected, limiting the speed of advance. This problem
   arises, in part, because of the way GPR data is typically processed. GPR
   data is first prescreened to reduce the volume of data considered for
   higher level feature-processing. Although fast, prescreening introduces
   latency that delays the feature processing and lowers the stopping
   distance of the system. In this work we propose a novel sensor fusion
   framework where a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera is used as a
   prescreener, providing suspicious locations to the GPR-based system with
   zero latency. The FLIR camera is another detection modality that
   typically yields a higher FAR than GPR while offering much larger
   stopping distances. This makes it well-suited in the role of a
   zero-latency prescreener. In this framework, GPR-based feature
   processing can begin without any latency, improving stopping distances.
   This framework was evaluated using well-known FLIR and GPR detection
   algorithms on a large dataset collected at a Western US test site.
   Experiments were conducted to investigate the tradeoff between early
   stopping distance and FAR. The results indicate that earlier stopping
   distances are achievable while maintaining effective FARs. However,
   because an earlier stopping distance yields less data for feature
   extraction, there is a general tradeoff between detection performance
   and stopping distance.}},

Abstract = {{Target detection algorithms for ground penetrating radar (GPR) data
   typically calculate local statistics for the background data surrounding
   a test sample as a means to assess changes in the data from background.
   To ensure that the local statistics are indicative of only the
   background data and not the data due to a potential target, a guard-band
   is employed to prohibit the data near the test sample from being used in
   the calculations. The selection of the guard-band can greatly impact
   performance, and the value chosen should be based on the expected size
   of a target response, which is a challenging task when the target
   population varies greatly. This work develops a robust Bayesian approach
   to target detection that does not require selection of a guard-band. By
   modeling the data using Students t distribution rather than a Gaussian
   distribution, an inference algorithm is developed that automatically
   identifies outliers from the background and excludes them while
   calculating the local statistics. The algorithm that was developed is
   applied to handheld GPR data, where it is shown to provide improved
   performance over any particular selection of a guard-band.}},

Abstract = {{Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a very promising technology for
   subsurface threat detection. A successful algorithm employing GPR should
   achieve high detection rates at a low false-alarm rate and do so at
   operationally relevant speeds. GPRs measure reflections at dielectric
   boundaries that occur at the interfaces between different materials.
   These boundaries may occur at any depth, within the sensor's range, and
   furthermore, the dielectric changes could be such that they induce a 180
   degree phase shift in the received signal relative to the emitted GPR
   pulse. As a result of these time-of-arrival and phase variations,
   extracting robust features from target responses in GPR is not
   straightforward. In this work, a method to mitigate polarity and
   alignment variations based on an expectation-maximization (EM)
   principal-component analysis (PCA) approach is proposed. This work
   demonstrates how model-based target alignment can significantly improve
   detection performance. Performance is measured according to the
   improvement in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for
   classification before and after the data is properly aligned and
   phase-corrected.}},

Abstract = {{A number of recent algorithms have shown improved performance in
   detecting buried explosive threats by statistically modeling target
   responses observed in ground penetrating radar (GPR) signals. These
   methods extract features from known examples of target responses to
   train a statistical classifier. The statistical classifiers are then
   used to identify targets emplaced in previously unseen conditions. Due
   to the variation in target GPR responses caused by factors such as
   differing soil conditions, classifiers require training on a large,
   varied dataset to encompass the signal variation expected in operational
   conditions. These training collections generally involve burying each
   target type in a number of soil conditions, at a number of burial
   depths. The cost associated with both burying the targets, and
   collecting the data is extremely high. Thus, the conditions and depths
   sampled cover only a subset of possible scenarios. The goal of this
   research is to improve the ability of a classifier to generalize to new
   conditions by deforming target responses in accordance with the physical
   properties of GPR signals. These signal deformations can simulate a
   target response under different conditions than those represented in the
   data collection. This research shows that improved detection performance
   in previously unseen conditions can be achieved by utilizing
   deformations, even when the training dataset is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Buried threat detection system (e.g., GPR, FLIR, EMI) performance can be
   summarized through two related statistics: the probability of detection
   (PD), and the false alarm rate (FAR). These statistics impact system
   rate of forward advance, clearance probability, and the overall
   usefulness of the system. Understanding system PD and FAR for each
   target type of interest is fundamental to making informed decisions
   regarding system procurement and deployment. Since PD and FAR cannot be
   measured directly, proper experimental design is required to ensure that
   estimates of PD and FAR are accurate. Given an unlimited number of
   target emplacements, estimating PD is straightforward. However in
   realistic scenarios with constrained budgets, limited experimental
   collection time and space, and limited number of targets, estimating PD
   becomes significantly more complicated. For example, it may be less
   expensive to collect data over the same exact target emplacement
   multiple times than to collect once over multiple unique target
   emplacements. Clearly there is a difference between the quantity and
   value of the information obtained from these two experiments (one
   collection over multiple objects, and multiple collections over one
   particular object). This work will clarify and quantify the amount of
   information gained from multiple data collections over one target
   compared to collecting over multiple unique target burials. Results
   provide a closed-form solution to estimating the relative value of
   collecting multiple times over one object, or emplacing a new object,
   and how to optimize experimental design to achieve stated goals and
   simultaneously minimize cost.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels' applications are usually limited by their weak mechanical
   properties. Despite recent great progress in developing tough hydrogels,
   it is still challenging to achieve high values of stretchability,
   toughness and modulus all together in synthetic hydrogels. In this
   paper, we designed highly stretchable, tough, yet stiff hydrogel
   composites via a combination of nanoscale hybrid crosslinking and
   macroscale fiber reinforcement. The hydrogel composites were constructed
   by impregnating a 3D-printed thermoplastic-fiber mesh with a tough
   hydrogel crosslinked both covalently and ionically. The hydrogel
   composites can achieve a fracture energy of over 30 000 J m(-2), a
   modulus of over 6 MPa, and can be stretched over 2.8 times even in the
   presence of large structural defects. The enhancement of toughness in
   the new hydrogel composites relies on multiple pairs of toughening
   mechanisms which span over multiple length scales. A theoretical model
   is further developed to predict the toughness and modulus of the
   hydrogel composites and guide the design of future materials.}},

Abstract = {{Cells are exquisitely sensitive to the mechanical nature of their
   environment, including applied force and the stiffness of the
   extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent evidence has shown that these
   variables are critical regulators of diverse processes mediating
   embryonic development, adult tissue physiology, and many disease states,
   including cancer, atherosclerosis, and myopathies. Often, detection of
   mechanical stimuli is mediated by the structures that link cells that
   surround ECM, the focal adhesions (FAs). FAs are intrinsically force
   sensitive and display altered dynamics, structure, and composition in
   response to applied load. While much progress has been made in
   determining the proteins that localize to and regulate the formation of
   these structures, less is known about the role of tension across
   specific proteins in this process. A recently developed class of
   force-sensitive biosensors is enabling a greater understanding of the
   molecular bases of cellular mechanosensitivity and cell migration.}},

Abstract = {{Transport, toxicity, and therefore risks of engineered nanoparticles
   (ENPs) are unquestionably tied to interactions between those particles
   and surfaces. In this study, we proposed the simple and untested
   hypothesis that coating type can be the predominant factor affecting
   attachment of ENPs to silica surfaces across a range of ENP and coating
   types, effectively masking the contribution of the particle core to
   deposition behaviour. To test this hypothesis, TiO2, Ag-0 and C-60
   nanoparticles with either no coating or one of three types of adsorbed
   macromolecules (poly(acrylic acid), humic acid and bovine serum albumin)
   were prepared. The particle size and adsorbed layer thicknesses were
   characterised using dynamic light scattering and soft particle
   electrokinetic modelling. The attachment efficiencies of the
   nanoparticles to silica surfaces (glass beads) were measured in column
   experiments and compared with predictions from a semi-empirical
   correlation between attachment efficiency and coated particle properties
   that included particle size and layer thickness. For the nanoparticles
   and adsorbed macromolecules in this study, the attachment efficiencies
   could not be explained solely by the coating type. Therefore, the
   hypothesis that adsorbed macromolecules will mask the particle core and
   control attachment was disproved, and information on the properties of
   both the nanoparticle surface (e. g. charge and hydrophobicity) and
   adsorbed macromolecule (e. g. molecular weight, charge density extended
   layer thickness) will be required to explain or predict interactions of
   coated nanoparticles with surfaces in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{A fully suspended, stand-alone cone beam CT system capable of complex
   trajectories, in addition to a simple circular trajectory, has
   previously been developed and shown to minimize cone beam sampling
   insufficiencies and have better sampling close to the chest wall for
   pendant breast CT imaging. A hybrid SPECT-CT system with SPECT capable
   of complex 3D trajectories has already been implemented and is currently
   in use. Here, the individual systems are redesigned into one hybrid
   system where each individual component is capable of traversing
   independent, arbitrary trajectories around a pendant breast and anterior
   chest wall in a common field of view. The integration also involves key
   hardware upgrades: a new high resolution 40x30cm(2) flat panel CT imager
   with an 8mm bezel on two sides for closer chest wall access, a new x-ray
   source, and a unique tilting mechanism to enable the spherical
   trajectories for CT. A novel method to tilt the CT gantry about a 3D
   center of rotation is developed and included in the new gantry, while
   preserving the fully-3D SPECT system nested within the larger CT gantry.
   The flexibility of the integrated system is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{The coupling of light-inducible protein-protein interactions with gene
   regulation systems has enabled the control of gene expression with
   light. In particular, heterodimer protein pairs from plants can be used
   to engineer a gene regulation system in mammalian cells that is
   reversible, repeatable, tunable, controllable in a spatiotemporal
   manner, and targetable to any DNA sequence. This system, Light-Inducible
   Transcription using Engineered Zinc finger proteins (LITEZ), is based on
   the blue light-induced interaction of GIGANTEA and the LOV domain of
   FKF1 that drives the localization of a transcriptional activator to the
   DNA-binding site of a highly customizable engineered zinc finger
   protein. This chapter provides methods for modifying LITEZ to target new
   DNA sequences, engineering a programmable LED array to illuminate cell
   cultures, and using the modified LITEZ system to achieve spatiotemporal
   control of transgene expression in mammalian cells.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of CT lung nodule volume quantification technique depends on
   the precision of the quantification. To enable the evaluation of
   quantification precision, we previously developed a mathematical model
   that related precision to image resolution and noise properties in
   uniform backgrounds in terms of an estimability index (e'). The e' was
   shown to predict empirical precision across 54 imaging and
   reconstruction protocols, but with different correlation qualities for
   FBP and iterative reconstruction (IR) due to the non-linearity of IR
   impacted by anatomical structure. To better account for the
   non-linearity of IR, this study aimed to refine the noise
   characterization of the model in the presence of textured backgrounds.
   Repeated scans of an anthropomorphic lung phantom were acquired.
   Subtracted images were used to measure the image quantum noise, which
   was then used to adjust the noise component of the e' calculation
   measured from a uniform region. In addition to the model refinement, the
   validation of the model was further extended to 2 nodule sizes (5 and 10
   mm) and 2 segmentation algorithms. Results showed that the magnitude of
   IR's quantum noise was significantly higher in structured backgrounds
   than in uniform backgrounds (ASiR, 30-50\%; MBIR, 100-200\%). With the
   refined model, the correlation between e' values and empirical precision
   no longer depended on reconstruction algorithm. In conclusion, the model
   with refined noise characterization relfected the non-linearity of
   iterative reconstruction in structured background, and further showed
   successful prediction of quantification precision across a variety of
   nodule sizes, dose levels, slice thickness, reconstruction algorithms,
   and segmentation software.}},

Abstract = {{Instead of having the entire breast removed (a mastectomy), breast
   cancer patients often receive a breast conserving surgery (BCS) for
   removal of only the breast tumor. If post-surgery analysis reveals ta
   missed margin around the tumor tissue excised through the BCS procedure,
   the physician must often call the patient back for another surgery,
   which is both difficult and risky for the patient. If this ``margin
   detection{''} could be performed during the BCS procedure itself, the
   surgical team could use the analysis to ensure that all tumor tissue was
   removed in a single surgery, thereby potentially reducing the number of
   call backs from breast cancer surgery. We describe here a potential
   technique to detect surgical tumor margins in breast cancer using x-ray
   coherent scatter imaging. In this study, we demonstrate the imaging
   ability of this technique using Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The 2D and 3D modulation transfer functions (MTFs) of a custom made,
   large 40x30cm(2) area, 600-micron CsI-TFT based flat panel imager having
   127-micron pixellation, along with the micro-fiber scintillator
   structure, were characterized in detail using various techniques. The
   larger area detector yields a reconstructed FOV of 25cm diameter with an
   80cm SID in CT mode. The MTFs were determined with 1x1 (intrinsic)
   binning. The 2D MTFs were determined using a 50.8 micron tungsten wire
   and a solid lead edge, and the 3D MTF was measured using a custom made
   phantom consisting of three nearly orthogonal 50.8 micron tungsten wires
   suspended in an acrylic cubic frame. The 2D projection data was
   reconstructed using an iterative OSC algorithm using 16 subsets and 5
   iterations. As additional verification of the resolution, along with
   scatter, the Catphan (R) phantom was also imaged and reconstructed with
   identical parameters. The measured 2D MTF was similar to 4\% using the
   wire technique and similar to 1\% using the edge technique at the 3.94
   lp/mm Nyquist cut-off frequency. The average 3D MTF measured along the
   wires was similar to 8\% at the Nyquist. At 50\% MTF, the resolutions
   were 1.2 and 2.1 lp/mm in 2D and 3D, respectively. In the Catphan
   phantom, the 1.7 lp/mm bars were easily observed. Lastly, the 3D MTF
   measured on the three wires has an observed 5.9\% RMSD, indicating that
   the resolution of the imaging system is uniform and spatially
   independent. This high performance detector is integrated into a
   dedicated breast SPECT-CT imaging system.}},

Abstract = {{The 2D scatter-to-primary (SPR) ratios and 3D voxelized difference
   volumes were characterized for a cone beam breast CT scanner capable of
   arbitrary (non-traditional) 3D trajectories. The CT system uses a
   30x30cm(2) flat panel imager with 197 micron pixellation and a rotating
   tungsten anode x-ray source with 0.3mm focal spot, with an SID of 70cm.
   Data were acquired for two cylindrical phantoms (12.5cm and 15cm
   diameter) filled with three different combinations of water and methanol
   yielding a range of uniform densities. Projections were acquired with
   two acquisition trajectories: 1) simple-circular azimuthal orbit with
   fixed tilt; and 2) saddle orbit following a +/-15 degrees sinusoidal
   trajectory around the object. Projection data were acquired in 2x2
   binned mode. Projections were scatter corrected using a beam stop array
   method, and the 2D SPR was measured on the projections. The scatter
   corrected and uncorrected data were then reconstructed individually
   using an iterative ordered subsets convex algorithm, and the 3D
   difference volumes were calculated as the absolute difference between
   the two. Results indicate that the 2D SPR is similar to 7-15\% higher on
   projections with greatest tilt for the saddle orbit, due to the longer
   x-ray path length through the volume, compared to the 0 degrees tilt
   projections. Additionally, the 2D SPR increases with object diameter as
   well as density. The 3D voxelized difference volumes are an estimate of
   the scatter contribution to the reconstructed attenuation coefficients
   on a voxel level. They help visualize minor deficiencies and artifacts
   in the volumes due to correction methods.}},

Abstract = {{Commercially available computed tomography (CT) technologies such as
   iterative reconstruction (IR) have the potential to enable reduced
   patient doses while maintaining diagnostic image quality. However,
   systematically determining safe dose reduction levels for IR algorithms
   is a challenging task due to their non-linear nature. Most attempts to
   evaluate IR algorithms rely on measurements made in uniform phantoms.
   Such measurements may overstate the dose reduction potential of IR
   because they don't account for the complex relationship between
   anatomical variability and image quality. The purpose of this study was
   to design anatomically informed textured phantoms for CT performance
   evaluation. Two phantoms were designed to represent lung and soft-tissue
   textures. The lung phantom includes intricate vessel-like structures
   along with embedded nodules (spherical, lobulated, and spiculated). The
   soft tissue phantom was designed based on a three-dimensional clustered
   lumpy background with included low-contrast lesions (spherical and
   anthropomorphic). The phantoms were built using rapid prototyping (3D
   printing) technology and imaged on a modern multi-slice clinical CT
   scanner to assess the noise performance of a commercial IR algorithm in
   the context of uniform and textured backgrounds. Fifty repeated
   acquisitions were acquired for each background type and noise was
   assessed by measuring pixel standard deviation, across the ensemble of
   repeated acquisitions. For pixels in uniform areas, the IR algorithm
   reduced noise magnitude (STD) by 60\% (compared to FBP). However, for
   edge pixels, the noise magnitude in the IR images ranged from 20\%
   higher to 40\% lower compared to FBP. In all FBP images and in IR images
   of the uniform phantom, noise appeared to be globally non-stationary

Abstract = {{Despite the significant clinical benefits of computed tomography (CT) in
   providing diagnostic information for a broad range of diseases, concerns
   have been raised regarding the potential cancer risk induced by CT
   radiation exposure. In that regard, optimizing CT protocols and
   minimizing radiation dose have become the core problem for the CT
   community. To develop strategies to optimize radiation dose, it is
   crucial to effectively characterize CT image quality. Such image quality
   estimates need to be prospective to ensure that optimization can be
   performed before the scan is initiated. The purpose of this study was to
   establish a phantom-based methodology to predict quantum noise in CT
   images as a first step in our image quality prediction. Quantum noise
   was measured using a variable-sized phantom under clinical protocols.
   The mathematical relationship between noise and
   water-equivalent-diameter (Dw) was further established. The prediction
   was achieved by ascribing a noise value to a patient according to the
   patient's water-equivalent-diameter. The prediction accuracy was
   evaluated in anthropomorphic phantoms across a broad range of sizes,
   anatomy, and reconstruction algorithms. The differences between the
   measured and predicted noise were within 10\% for anthropomorphic
   phantoms across all sizes and anatomy. This study proposed a practically
   applicable technique to predict noise in CT images. With a prospective
   estimation of image quality level, the scanning parameters can then by
   adjusted to ensure optimized imaging performance.}},

Abstract = {{In an environment in which computed tomography (CT) has become an
   indispensable diagnostic tool employed with great frequency, dose
   concerns at the population level have become a subject of public
   attention. In that regard, optimizing radiation dose has become a core
   problem to the CT community. As a fundamental step to optimize radiation
   dose, it is crucial to effectively quantify radiation dose for a given
   CT exam. Such dose estimates need to be patient-specific to reflect
   individual radiation burden. It further needs to be prospective so that
   the scanning parameters can be dynamically adjusted before the scan is
   performed. The purpose of this study was to prospectively estimate organ
   dose in abdominopelvic CT exams under tube current modulation (TCM).
   CTDIvol-normalized-organ dose coefficients (h(fixed)) for fixed tube
   current were first estimated using a validated Monte Carlo simulation
   program and 58 computational phantoms. To account for the effect of TCM
   scheme, a weighted CTDIvol was computed for each organ based on the tube
   current modulation profile. The organ dose was predicted by multiplying
   the weighted CTDIvol with the organ dose coefficients (hfixed). To
   quantify prediction accuracy, each predicted organ dose was compared
   with organ dose simulated from Monte Carlo program with TCM profile
   explicitly modeled. The predicted organ dose showed good agreement with
   simulated organ dose across all organs and modulation strengths. For an
   average CTDIvol of a CT exam of 10 mGy, the}},

Abstract = {{Multi-modal image registration is needed to align medical images
   collected from different protocols or imaging sources, thereby allowing
   the mapping of complementary information between images. One challenge
   of multimodal image registration is that typical similarity measures
   rely on statistical correlations between image intensities to determine
   anatomical alignment. The use of alternate image representations could
   allow for mapping of intensities into a space or representation such
   that the multimodal images appear more similar, thus facilitating their
   co-registration. In this work, we present a spectral embedding based
   registration (SERg) method that uses non-linearly embedded
   representations obtained from independent components of statistical
   texture maps of the original images to facilitate multimodal image
   registration. Our methodology comprises the following main steps: 1)
   image-derived textural representation of the original images, 2)
   dimensionality reduction using independent component analysis (ICA), 3)
   spectral embedding to generate the alternate representations, and 4)
   image registration. The rationale behind our approach is that SERg
   yields embedded representations that can allow for very different
   looking images to appear more similar, thereby facilitating improved
   co-registration. Statistical texture features are derived from the image
   intensities and then reduced to a smaller set by using independent
   component analysis to remove redundant information. Spectral embedding
   generates a new representation by eigendecomposition from which only the
   most important eigenvectors are selected. This helps to accentuate areas
   of salience based on modality-invariant structural information and
   therefore better identifies corresponding regions in both the template
   and target images. The spirit behind SERg is that image registration
   driven by these areas of salience and correspondence should improve
   alignment accuracy. In this work, SERg is implemented using Demons to
   allow the algorithm to more effectively register multimodal images. SERg
   is also tested within the free-form deformation framework driven by
   mutual information. Nine pairs of synthetic T1-weighted to T2-weighted
   brain MRI were registered under the following conditions: five levels of
   noise (0\%, 1\%, 3\%, 5\%, and 7\%) and two levels of bias field (20\%
   and 40\%) each with and without noise. We demonstrate that across all of
   these conditions, SERg yields a mean squared error that is 81.51\% lower
   than that of Demons driven by MRI intensity alone. We also spatially
   align twenty-six ex vivo histology sections and in vivo prostate MRI in
   order to map the spatial extent of prostate cancer onto corresponding
   radiologic imaging. SERg performs better than intensity registration by
   decreasing the root mean squared distance of annotated landmarks in the
   prostate gland via both Demons algorithm and mutual information-driven
   free-form deformation. In both synthetic and clinical experiments, the
   observed improvement in alignment of the template and target images
   suggest the utility of parametric eigenvector representations and hence
   SERg for multimodal image registration.}},

Abstract = {{Use of mRNA-based vaccines for tumour immunotherapy has gained
   increasing attention in recent years. A growing number of studies
   applying nanomedicine concepts to mRNA tumour vaccination show that the
   mRNA delivered in nanoparticle format can generate a more robust immune
   response. Advances in the past decade have deepened our understanding of
   gene delivery barriers, mRNA's biological stability and immunological
   properties, and support the notion for engineering innovations tailored
   towards a more efficient mRNA nanoparticle vaccine delivery system. In
   this review we will first examine the suitability of mRNA for
   engineering manipulations, followed by discussion of a model framework
   that highlights the barriers to a robust anti-tumour immunity mediated
   by mRNA encapsulated in nanoparticles. Finally, by consolidating
   existing literature on mRNA nanoparticle tumour vaccination within the
   context of this framework, we aim to identify bottlenecks that can be

Abstract = {{We consider the group basis pursuit problem, which extends basis pursuit
   by replacing the l(1) norm with a weighted-l(2,1) norm. We provide an
   anytime algorithm, called generalized alternating projection (GAP), to
   solve this problem. The GAP algorithm extends classical alternating
   projection to the case in which projections are performed between convex
   sets that undergo a systematic sequence of changes. We prove that, under
   a set of group-restricted isometry property (group-RIP) conditions, the
   reconstruction error of GAP monotonically converges to zero. Thus the
   algorithm can be interrupted at any time to return a valid solution and
   can be resumed subsequently to improve the solution. This anytime
   convergence property saves iterations on retracting and correcting
   mistakes, which, along with an effective acceleration scheme, makes GAP
   converge fast. Moreover, the periteration computation is inexpensive,
   consisting of sorting of a linear array followed by groupwise
   thresholding and linear transform of vectors for which fast algorithms
   often exist. We evaluate the algorithmic performance through extensive

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider a proper generalized decomposition method to

   inspired by the Arnoldi method for solving eigenproblems, is proposed
   for an efficient greedy construction of a deterministic reduced basis

   deterministic and stochastic components of the solution, thus allowing
   reuse of preexisting deterministic Navier-Stokes solvers. It has the
   remarkable property of only requiring the solution of m uncoupled
   deterministic problems for the construction of an m-dimensional reduced

Abstract = {{Multifunctional films with both antimicrobial activity and
   fouling-release ability based on a biocidal quaternary ammonium salt
   (QAS) and thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) were
   deposited on substrates using resonant infrared, matrix-assisted pulsed
   laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE). The surface properties of these films
   were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM),
   and water contact angle measurements. The biocidal and release
   properties of the films were tested against Escherichia coli K12 and
   Staphylococcus epidermidis. At 37 degrees C, the deposited film
   facilitated bacterial attachment and killed a majority of attached
   bacteria. Decrease of the temperature to 25 degrees C promoted the
   hydration and at least partial dissolution of PNIPAAm, leading to
   bacterial detachment from the film. To enhance the retention of PNIPAAm
   on the substrate, a small amount of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane
   (APTES) was incorporated as a stabilizer, resulting in a ternary film
   with biocidal activity and bacterial-release ability after several
   attach-kill-release cycles. The simplicity and universality of RIR-MAPLE
   to form films on a wide range of substrata make it a promising technique
   to deposit multifunctional films to actively mitigate bacterial
   biofouling.}},

Abstract = {{This study documents the first attempt to apply the singular boundary
   method, a recently developed meshless boundary collocation method, to
   the solution of inverse anisotropic heat conduction problems. The method
   cures the perplexing fictitious boundary issue associated with the
   method of fundamental solutions while inheriting the merits of the
   latter of being truly meshless, integration-free and easy to programme.
   Thanks to its boundary-only discretization and semi-analytical nature,
   the method can be viewed as an ideal candidate for the solution of
   inverse problems. Four benchmark examples indicate that the proposed
   method, in connection with proper regularization techniques, is
   accurate, computationally efficient and numerically stable for the
   solution of inverse problems with various levels of noisy Cauchy data.}},

Abstract = {{Providing high quality mammography education to radiology trainees is
   essential, as good interpretation skills potentially ensure the highest
   benefit of screening mammography for patients. We have previously
   proposed a computer-aided education system that utilizes trainee models,
   which relate human-assessed image characteristics to interpretation
   error. We proposed that these models be used to identify the most
   difficult and therefore the most educationally useful cases for each
   trainee. In this study, as a next step in our research, we propose to
   build trainee models that utilize features that are automatically
   extracted from images using computer vision algorithms. To predict
   error, we used a logistic regression which accepts imaging features as
   input and returns error as output. Reader data from 3 experts and 3
   trainees were used. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was
   applied to evaluate the proposed trainee models. Our experiments showed
   that, for three trainees, our models were able to predict error better
   than chance. This is an important step in the development of adaptive
   computer-aided education systems since computer-extracted features will
   allow for faster and more extensive search of imaging databases in order
   to identify the most educationally beneficial cases.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging in long wavelength regimes holds huge potential in many fields,
   from security to skin cancer detection. However, it is often difficult
   to image at these frequencies - the so called `THz gap(1)' is no
   exception. Current techniques generally involve mechanically raster
   scanning a single detector to gain spatial information(2), or
   utilization of a THz focal plane array (FPA)(3). However, raster
   scanning results in slow image acquisition times and FPAs are relatively
   insensitive to THz radiation, requiring the use of high powered sources.
   In a different approach, a single pixel detector can be used in which
   radiation from an object is spatially modulated with a coded aperture to
   gain spatial information. This multiplexing technique has not fully
   taken off in the THz regime due to the lack of efficient coded
   apertures, or spatial light modulators (SLMs), that operate in this
   regime.
   Here we present the implementation of a single pixel THz camera using an
   active SLM. We use metamaterials to create an electronically
   controllable SLM, permitting the acquisition of high-fidelity THz
   images. We gain a signal-to-noise advantage over raster scanning schemes
   through a multiplexing technique(4). We also use a source that is orders
   of magnitude lower in power than most THz FPA implementations(3,5).
   Weare able to utilize compressive sensing algorithms to reduce the
   number of measurements needed to reconstruct an image, and hence
   increase our frame rate to 1 Hz. This first generation device represents
   a significant step towards the realization of a single pixel THz camera.}},

Abstract = {{Targeted therapies such as PI3K inhibition can affect tumor vasculature,
   and hence delivery of imaging agents like FDG, while independently
   modifying intrinsic glucose demand. Therefore, it is important to
   identify whether perceived changes in glucose uptake are caused by
   vascular or true metabolic changes. This study sought to develop an
   optical strategy for quantifying tissue glucose uptake free of
   cross-talk from tracer delivery effects. Glucose uptake kinetics were
   measured using a fluorescent D-glucose derivative
   2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) Amino)-2-deoxy-D-glucose
   (2-NBDG), and 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)
   Amino)-2-deoxy-L-glucose (2-NBDLG) was used as a control to report on
   non-specific uptake. Vascular oxygenation (SO2) was calculated from
   wavelength-dependent hemoglobin absorption.
   We have previously shown that the rate of 2-NBDG delivery in vivo
   profoundly affects perceived demand. In this study, we investigated the
   potential of the ratio of 2-NBDG uptake to the rate of delivery
   (2-NBDG(60)/R-D) to report on 2-NBDG demand in vivo free from
   confounding delivery effects. In normal murine tissue, we show that
   2-NBDG(60)/R-D can distinguish specific uptake from non-specific cell
   membrane binding, whereas fluorescence intensity alone cannot. The ratio
   2-NBDG(60)/R-D also correlates with blood glucose more strongly than
   2-NBDG(60) does in normal murine tissue. Additionally, 2-NBDG(60)/R-D
   can distinguish normal murine tissue from a murine metastatic tumor
   across a range of SO2 values. The results presented here indicate that
   the ratio of 2-NBDG uptake to the rate of 2-NBDG delivery
   (2-NBDG(60)/R-D) is superior to 2-NBDG intensity alone for quantifying
   changes in glucose demand.}},

Abstract = {{Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a three-dimensional, non-invasive
   optical imaging technique that relies on low-coherence interferometry.
   OCT has the capability of imaging 2 - 3 mm into tissue, which enables
   imaging of deeper structures within the embryo with a relatively high
   spatial resolution (2 - 15 mu m). Within the past decade, OCT has been
   increasingly used as a live imaging tool for embryonic cardiovascular
   research in several animal models. Research in our lab has recently
   shown that OCT can be used in combination with embryo culture for the
   visualization of early mammalian cardiovascular development (E7.5 -
   E10.0). Here, we demonstrate that OCT can be used for the guided
   microinjection of gold-silica nanoshell suspension into the
   cardiovascular system in live embryos without deleterious effect. This
   approach shows a promising application for the OCT guided delivery of
   contrast agents, viral vectors, therapeutic or pharmacological agents,
   signaling molecules or dyes to specific organ systems or tissues in live
   embryos and demonstrates a great potential for gold-silica nanoshells as
   a contrast agent in embryonic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology provides tremendous biomedical opportunities for cancer
   diagnosis, imaging, and therapy. In contrast to conventional
   chemotherapeutic agents where their actual target delivery cannot be
   easily imaged, integrating imaging and therapeutic properties into one
   platform facilitates the understanding of pharmacokinetic profiles, and
   enables monitoring of the therapeutic process in each individual. Such a
   concept dubbed ``theranostics{''} potentiates translational research and
   improves precision medicine. One particular challenging application of
   theranostics involves imaging and controlled delivery of nanoplatforms
   across blood-brain-barrier (BBB) into brain tissues. Typically, the BBB
   hinders paracellular flux of drug molecules into brain parenchyma. BBB
   disrupting agents (e.g. mannitol, focused ultrasound), however, suffer
   from poor spatial confinement. It has been a challenge to design a
   nanoplatform not only acts as a contrast agent but also improves the BBB
   permeation. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of plasmonic
   gold nanoparticles as both high-resolution optical contrast agent and
   focalized tumor BBB permeation-inducing agent. We specifically examined
   the microscopic distribution of nanoparticles in tumor brain animal
   models. We observed that most nanoparticles accumulated at the tumor
   periphery or perivascular spaces. Nanoparticles were present in both
   endothelial cells and interstitial matrices. This study also
   demonstrated a novel photothermal-induced BBB permeation. Fine-tuning
   the irradiating energy induced gentle disruption of the vascular
   integrity, causing short-term extravasation of nanomaterials but without
   hemorrhage. We conclude that our gold nanoparticles are a powerful
   biocompatible contrast agent capable of inducing focal BBB permeation,
   and therefore envision a strong potential of plasmonic gold nanoparticle
   in future brain tumor imaging and therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Coherent x-ray scatter (also know as x-ray diffraction) has long been
   used to non-destructively investigate the molecular structure of
   materials for industrial, medical, security, and fundamental purposes.
   Unfortunately, molecular tomography based on coherent scatter typically
   requires long scan times and/or large incident fluxes, which has limited
   the practical applicability of such schemes. One can overcome the
   conventional challenges by employing compressive sensing theory to
   optimize the information obtained per incident photon. We accomplish
   this in two primary ways: we use a coded aperture to structure the
   incident illumination and realize massive measurement parallelization
   and use photon-counting, energy-sensitive detection to recover maximal
   information from each detected photon. We motivate and discuss here the
   general imaging principles, investigate different coding and sampling
   strategies, and provide results from theoretical studies for our
   structured illumination scheme. We find that this approach promises
   real-time molecular tomography of bulk objects without a loss in imaging
   performance.}},

   the stepped connection structure, the impedance matching is

   the impedance matching is significantly improved in the band from 3 to
   15.1 GHz. In addition, a measured gain, which is better than 5 dBi, is
   obtained with a compact size. Compared to other techniques, the
   presented technique effectively improves the impedance matching and
   enlarges the bandwidth without changing the overall dimensions.
   Moreover, a relatively flat group time delay response is achieved within

Abstract = {{This protocol describes the implementation of laser scanning lithography

   focused 532 urn laser using a commercially available laser scanning
   confocal microscope. Unlike traditional photolithography methods, this
   technique does not require the use of a physical master and instead
   utilizes digital ``virtual masks{''} that can be modified ``on the
   fly{''} allowing for quick pattern modifications. The process to create
   multifaceted, micropatterned surfaces, surfaces that display pattern
   arrays of multiple biomolecules with each molecule confined to its own
   array, is described in detail. The generation of pattern configurations
   from user-chosen images, image-guided LSL is also described. This
   protocol outlines LSL in four basic sections. The first section details
   substrate preparation and includes cleaning of glass coverslips, metal
   deposition, and alkanethiol functionalization. The second section
   describes two ways to define pattern configurations, the first through
   manual input of pattern coordinates and dimensions using Zeiss AIM
   software and the second via image-guided pattern generation using a
   custom-written MATLAB script. The third section describes the details of
   the patterning procedure and postpatterning functionalization with an
   alkanethiol, protein, and both, and the fourth section covers cell
   seeding and culture. We end with a general discussion concerning the
   pitfalls of LSL and present potential improvements that can be made to
   the technique.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer has become one of most significant death reasons and causes
   approximately 7.9 million human deaths worldwide each year. The
   challenge to detect cancer at an early stage makes cancer-related
   biomarkers sensing attract more and more research interest and efforts.
   Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) provides a promising method for
   various biomarkers (DNA, RNA, protein, et al.) detection due to its high
   sensitivity, specificity and capability for multiple analytes detection.
   Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive photon-scattering technique,
   which provides molecule-specific information on molecular vibrational
   energy levels. SERS takes advantage of plasmonic effects and can enhance
   Raman signal up to 1015 at ``hot spots{''}. Due to its excellent
   sensitivity, SERS has been capable of achieving single-molecule
   detection limit. Local pH environment has been identified to be a
   potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis since solid cancer contains
   highly acidic environments. A near-infrared (NIR) SERS nanoprobe based
   on gold nanostars for pH sensing is developed for future cancer
   detection. Near-infrared (NIR) light is more suitable for in vivo
   applications because of its low attenuation rate and tissue auto
   fluorescence. SERS spectrum of pH reporter under various pH environments
   is monitored and used for pH sensing. Furthermore, density functional
   theory (DFT) calculation is performed to investigate Raman spectra
   changes with pH at the molecular level. The study demonstrates that SERS
   is a sensitive tool to monitor minor molecular structural changes due to
   local pH environment for cancer detection.}},

   fouling release properties}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{4750-4757}},
Abstract = {{Surfaces incorporating the antimicrobial enzyme, lysozyme, have been
   previously demonstrated to effectively disrupt bacterial cellular
   envelopes. As with any surface active antimicrobial, however,
   lysozyme-expressing surfaces become limited in their utility by the
   accumulation of dead bacteria and debris. Surfaces modified with
   environmentally responsive polymers, on the other hand, have been shown
   to reversibly attach and release both live and dead bacterial cells. In
   this work, we combine the antimicrobial activity of lysozyme with the
   fouling release capability of the thermally responsive polymer,
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), which has a lower critical
   solution temperature (LCST) in water at similar to 32 degrees C.
   Nanopatterned PNIPAAm brushes were fabricated using interferometric
   lithography followed by surface-initiated polymerization. Lysozyme was
   then adsorbed into the polymer-free regions of the substrate between the
   brushes to achieve a hybrid surface with switchable antimicrobial
   activity and fouling-release ability in response to the change of
   temperature. The temperature triggered hydration and conformational
   change of the nanopatterned PNIPAAm brushes provide the ability to
   temporally regulate the spatial concealment and exposure of adsorbed
   lysozyme. The biocidal efficacy and release properties of the hybrid
   surface were tested against Escherichia coli K12 and Staphylococcus
   epidermidis. The hybrid surfaces facilitated the attachment of bacteria
   at 37 degrees C for E. coli and 25 degrees C for S. epidermidis and when
   the temperature is above the LCST, collapsed and dehydrated PNIPAAm
   chains expose lysozyme to kill attached bacteria. Changing temperature
   across the LCST of PNIPAAm (e. g. from 37 degrees C to 25 degrees C for
   E. coli or from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C for S. epidermidis) to
   induce a hydration transition of PNIPAAm promoted the release of dead
   bacteria and debris from the surfaces upon mild shearing. These results
   suggest that nano-engineered surfaces can provide an effective way for
   actively mitigating short term bacterial biofouling.}},

Title = {{Prenatal dexamethasone augments the neurobehavioral teratology of
   chlorpyrifos: Significance for maternal stress and preterm labor}},
Journal = {{NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{35-42}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Glucocorticoids are the consensus treatment given in preterm labor and
   are also elevated by maternal stress; organophosphate exposures are
   virtually ubiquitous, so human developmental coexposures to these two
   agents are common. This study explores how prenatal dexamethasone
   exposure modifies the neurobehavioral teratology of chlorpyrifos, one of
   the most widely used organophosphates. We administered dexamethasone to
   pregnant rats on gestational days 17-19 at a standard therapeutic dose
   (0.2 mg/kg); offspring were then given chlorpyrifos on postnatal days
   1-4, at a dose (1 mg/kg) that produces barely-detectable (<10\%)
   inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity. Dexamethasone did not alter
   brain chlorpyrifos concentrations, nor did either agent alone or in
   combination affect brain thyroxine levels. Assessments were carried out
   from adolescence through adulthood encompassing T-maze alternation,
   Figure 8 maze (locomotor activity, habituation), novelty-suppressed
   feeding and novel object recognition tests. For behaviors where
   chlorpyrifos or dexamethasone individually had small effects, the dual
   exposure produced larger, significant effects that reflected additivity
   (locomotor activity, novelty-suppressed feeding, novel object
   recognition). Where the individual effects were in opposite directions
   or were restricted to only one agent, we found enhancement of
   chlorpyrifos' effects by prenatal dexamethasone (habituation). Finally,
   for behaviors where controls displayed a normal sex difference in
   performance, the combined treatment either eliminated or reversed the
   difference (locomotor activity, novel object recognition). Combined
   exposure to dexamethasone and chlorpyrifos results in a worsened
   neurobehavioral outcome, providing a proof-of-principle that prenatal
   glucocorticoids can create a subpopulation with enhanced vulnerability
   to environmental toxicants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Hybrid Optimization for Pattern Synthesis of Large Antenna Arrays}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{81-91}},
Abstract = {{The pattern synthesis for large antenna arrays has drawn significant
   attention because of its wide applications. This paper introduces a
   hybrid approach for the fast pencil beam pattern synthesis of the large
   non-uniform linear or planar array, which can significantly reduce the
   computational cost, the number of antenna in the array, the minimum
   sidelobe level and the null control. The proposed method has an
   iterative scheme which is composed of the nonuniform Fourier transform
   (NUFFT) and the global optimization method to minimize the peak sidelobe
   level and control the null. The NUFFT is utilized to determine
   excitation magnitudes for a fixed positions non-uniform array.
   Alternatively, the global optimization is used to find the optimal
   positions which lead to the minimum peak sidelobe level (PSL). The lower
   excitations can be deleted due to yielding less performance on sidelobe
   level, which is called the array removal strategy. Compare with
   conventional methods, the simulations on synthetic models show that a
   minimum sidelobe level and null control can be obtained in processing
   sparse linear and concentric circular antenna arrays more efficiently.}},
