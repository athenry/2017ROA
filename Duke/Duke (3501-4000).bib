Abstract = {{Carbon (C) metabolism is at the core of ecosystem function. Decomposers
   play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by
   mineralizing organic matter to CO2. Their growth depends on the
   carbon-use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of growth over C
   uptake. By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C
   stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the
   importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial
   decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most
   biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical
   basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems,
   highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under
   future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence
   from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature
   increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence
   shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient
   availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved
   nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration
   from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature
   and plant C : N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current
   biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE
   responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the stability of a pivoting cylindrical
   container that is slowly filled with fluid. The action of filling the
   container with fluid causes the system's potential energy to evolve and
   modify the stability of equilibria. We analyze the stability behavior of
   this system and find distinct regions where edge and spill conditions
   require alternative expressions for the system's potential energy. The
   stability of the upright and tilt angle equilibria are studied using the
   Lagrange-Dirichlet theorem. We provide exact expressions for the
   potential energy of the system and bifurcation diagrams that compactly
   represent the stability behavior of the upright equilibria and
   additionally predict the presence of non-trivial or tilted equilibria.
   Theoretical investigations are then compared with a series of
   experimental tests that validate the container upright and tilted
   equilibria stability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) can easily become aggregated when blended
   in a polymer matrix. Although several techniques have been reported to
   prepare dispersed CQDs in a polymer matrix, the novel approach of this
   work is to obtain well-dispersed CQD-polymer nanocomposites through the
   in situ photopolymerization of a third source, thereby broadening the
   material selection available for such nanocomposites. Therefore,
   dispersed CQD-polymer nanocomposites were prepared by the
   photopolymerization of 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AEM)
   precursor in a blend of trioctyl phosphine oxide-capped CdSe CQDs and
   poly(2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-alpha,alpha'dicyano-p-xylylidene-alt
   -2,5-dihexyoxy-p-xylylidene) (MEH-CN-PPV). The photopolymerization of
   AEM was developed for this work in order to prevent possible
   decomposition of CQDs induced by introducing metallic catalysts or heat
   and to eliminate the need for further functionalization of CQDs or
   polymers. The morphology of the photopolymerized CdSe CQD/MEH-CN-PPV/AEM
   was corroborated by direct observation of the quantum dot dispersion in
   the resultant sphere-shaped structures via transmission electron
   microscopy. Photoluminescence quenching and shorter photoluminescence
   decay lifetime of the MEH-CN-PPV in the photopolymerized nanocomposite
   were observed, indicating that the photopolymerized CdSe
   CQD/MEH-CN-PPV/AEM nanocomposite has an enhanced energy transfer
   efficiency in comparison to typical aggregated CdSe quantum
   dot/MEH-CN-PPV nanocomposites as a result of better dispersion.}},

Abstract = {{Given the demonstrated antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles
   (AgNPs), and the key role that microorganisms play in performing
   critical ecosystem functions such as decomposition and nutrient cycling,
   there is growing concern that AgNP pollution may negatively impact
   ecosystems. We examined the response of streamwater and sediment
   microorganisms to commercially available 21 +/- A 17 nm AgNPs, and
   compared AgNP impacts to those of dissolved-Ag added as AgNO3. We show
   that in streamwater, AgNPs and AgNO3 decreased respiration in proportion
   to dissolved-Ag concentrations at the end of the incubation (r(2) =
   0.78), while in sediment the only measurable effect of AgNPs was a 14 \%
   decrease in sulfate concentration. This contrasts with the stronger
   effects of dissolved-Ag additions in both streamwater and sediment. In
   streamwater, addition of dissolved-Ag at a level equivalent to the
   lowest AgNP dose led to respiration below detection, a 55 \% drop in
   phosphatase enzyme activity, and a 10-fold increase in phosphate
   concentration. In sediment, AgNO3 addition at a level equivalent to the
   highest AgNP addition led to a 34 \% decrease in respiration, a 55 \%
   increase in microbial biomass, and a shift in bacterial community
   composition. The results of this study suggest that, in similar
   freshwater environments, the short-term biological impacts of AgNPs on
   microbes are attenuated by the physical and chemical properties of
   streamwater and sediment.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report the first phase of developing self-healing acrylic bone
   cement: the preparation and characterization of polyurethane (PUR)
   microcapsules containing a medical cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive.
   Capsules were prepared by interfacial polymerization of a
   toluene-2,4-diisocyanate-based polyurethane prepolymer with
   1,4-butanediol to encapsulate 2-octylcyanoacrylate (OCA). Various
   capsule characteristics, including: resultant morphology, average size
   and size distribution, shell thickness, content and reactivity of
   encapsulated agent, and shelf life are investigated and their reliance
   on solvent type and amount, surfactant type and amount, temperature, pH,
   agitation rate, reaction time, and mode of addition of the oil phase to
   the aqueous phase are presented. Capsules had average diameters ranging
   from 74 to 222 mu m and average shell thicknesses ranging from 1.5 to 6
   mu m. The capsule content was determined via thermogravimetric analysis
   and subsequent analysis of the capsules following up to 8 weeks storage
   revealed minimal loss of core contents. Mechanical testing of
   OCA-containing capsules showed individual capsules withstood compressive
   forces up to a few tenths of Newtons, and the contents released from
   crushed capsules generated tensile adhesive forces of a few Newtons.
   Capsules were successfully mixed into the poly(methyl methacrylate) bone
   cement, surviving the mixing process, exposure to methyl methacrylate
   monomer, and the resulting exothermic matrix curing. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Stem cells possess unique abilities as they can renew themselves for
   extended periods of time and have the capacity to differentiate into a
   variety of lineages. They hold promise for treating a plethora of
   diseases ranging from musculoskeletal defects to myocardial infarction
   and to neural disorders. Understanding how to control the fate decision
   of these cells to self-renew or differentiate is paramount in stem cell
   tissue engineering. Recently, significant progress has been made in
   guiding stem cell differentiation in vitro, and we are beginning to
   understand the complex interplay of factors that control their fate.
   Here, we highlight the recent approaches for guidance of stem cells
   through patterning of surfaces at the micro- and nanoscale. Particular
   attention is given to chemical patterning of substrates with adhesion
   ligands and physical patterning with a variety of topographical
   features. These surface-mediated biochemical and mechanical cues have
   proven influential in altering a wide range of stem cell phenotypes.
   This approach to guide or ultimately control stem cells by surface
   patterning has enormous potential implications in cell therapies and
   regenerative medicine. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the role of the surface}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{We present a numerical investigation of the second-order nonlinear
   optical properties of metal-based metamaterial nanoresonators. The
   nonlinear optical response of the metal is described by a hydrodynamic
   model, with the effects of electron pressure in the electron gas also
   taken into account. We show that as the pressure term tends to zero the
   amount of converted second-harmonic field tends to an asymptotic value.
   In this limit it becomes possible to rewrite the nonlinear surface
   contributions as functions of the value of the polarization vector
   inside the bulk region. Nonlocality thus can be incorporated into
   numerical simulations without actually utilizing the nonlocal equation
   of motion or solving for the rapidly varying fields that occur near the
   metal surface. We use our model to investigate the second-harmonic
   generation process with three-dimensional gold nanoparticle arrays and
   show that nanocrescents can easily attain conversion efficiencies of
   similar to 6.0 x 10(-8) for pumping peak intensities of a few tens of
   MW/cm(2).}},

Abstract = {{This article describes computationally efficient approaches and
   associated theoretical performance guarantees for the detection of known
   targets and anomalies from few projection measurements of the underlying
   signals. The proposed approaches accommodate signals of different
   strengths contaminated by a colored Gaussian background, and perform
   detection without reconstructing the underlying signals from the
   observations. The theoretical performance bounds of the target detector
   highlight fundamental tradeoffs among the number of measurements
   collected, amount of background signal present, signal-to-noise ratio,
   and similarity among potential targets coming from a known dictionary.
   The anomaly detector is designed to control the number of false
   discoveries. The proposed approach does not depend on a known sparse
   representation of targets; rather, the theoretical performance bounds
   exploit the structure of a known dictionary of targets and the distance
   preservation property of the measurement matrix. Simulation experiments
   illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel methodology based on hyperspectral imagery with
   enhanced Darkfield microscopy for detection, characterization, and
   analysis of engineered nanoparticles in both ultrapure water and in
   complex waters, such as simulated-wetland ecosystem water and
   wastewater. Hyperspectral imagery analysis of 12 different nanoparticle
   sample types, scattering the obliquely incident visible and
   near-infrared light (VNIR: 400-1000 nm) in an enhanced Darkfield
   background, showed that the sample information in terms of the spatial
   distribution as well as spectral characteristics unique to each
   nanoparticle types, at a sensitivity of single nanoparticle (size >= nm)
   can be obtained. Hyperspectral imagery and Raman spectral analyses of
   the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) revealed that the apparent hydrodynamic
   size of the particle increased while the primary size remained unchanged
   in the presence of coatings, which is further confirmed by dynamic light
   scattering measurements. Similar in size, AgNPs with different coatings
   exhibited similar spectral color (or peak position) but a red-shift in
   the peak positions by same amount relative to Bare AgNPs was observed.
   In conclusion, hyperspectral imagery with enhanced Darkfield microscopy
   can be a promising tool for detection and characterization of engineered
   nanoparticles in environmental systems, facilitating studies on fate and
   transformation of these particles in various types of water samples.}},

Title = {{Charge moment change and lightning-driven electric fields associated
   with negative sprites and halos}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Sprites are structured high altitude optical emissions produced by
   lightning-driven electric fields. Both strong positive and negative
   cloud to ground flashes (CGs) are capable of initiating sprites.
   However, reported sprites are almost exclusively produced by +CGs. The
   very limited number of negative polarity sprites makes it difficult to
   reveal their morphologies and mechanisms. Since 2008, we have operated
   low light cameras at 5 locations in the United States to detect
   lightning-driven transient luminous events (TLEs). At Duke University,
   two pairs of magnetic sensors simultaneously record lightning-radiated
   magnetic fields. During 4 years of observations, the low light cameras
   collectively captured 1651 sprite events. Among them, 6 were produced by
   -CG lightning, which was confirmed by both the National Lightning
   Detection Network (NLDN) and magnetic field measurements. All of these
   negative sprites show similar features in their morphology, lightning
   source current, and lightning-driven ambient electric fields. They all
   initiate within a few ms from their parent lightning discharges and
   always are accompanied by sprite halos. Compared to positive sprites,
   the downward streamers in negative sprites terminate at higher
   altitudes, about 55-60 km. The extracted source current of their parent
   lightning discharges is very impulsive and produces at least 450 C km
   charge moment change in 0.5 ms or less. Unlike most +CG strokes,
   essentially no continuing current follows these -CGs. Thus the
   uniformity of negative sprite morphology appears to reflect the
   uniformity of the characteristics of high charge transfer negative
   strokes. Numerical simulation shows these impulsive source currents
   produce very high (>2 E-k, where E-k is the local air breakdown field)
   but short-lived electric fields at halo altitudes between 70 km and 90
   km. At streamer termination altitudes, the inferred background electric
   field is 0.2-0.3 E-k, which is close to but below the critical field
   (0.4 E-k) for negative streamer propagation. The simulations also show
   that the timescale of the lightning source current has a significant
   impact on the high altitude electric fields and thus the sprite
   initiation and morphology. With the same amount of charge transfer, a
   more impulsive current source produces a higher electric field of
   shorter duration at halo and sprite altitudes. The short timescales may
   explain why a larger threshold of total charge moment change is required
   to initiate negative sprites than short-delayed positive sprites, whose
   parent lightning source current is usually less impulsive.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we experimentally and theoretically explore
   voltage-controlled oscillations occurring in microbeams of vanadium
   dioxide. These oscillations are a result of the reversible
   insulator-to-metal phase transition in vanadium dioxide. By examining
   the structure of the observed oscillations in detail, we propose a
   modified percolative-avalanche model which allows for voltage
   triggering. This model captures the periodicity and waveshape of the
   oscillations as well as several other key features. Importantly, our
   modeling shows that while temperature plays a critical role in the
   vanadium dioxide phase transition, electrically induced heating can not
   act as the primary instigator of the oscillations in this configuration.
   This realization leads us to identify the electric field as the most
   likely candidate for driving the phase transition.}},

Title = {{Recent advances in proton exchange membranes for fuel cell applications}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Fuel cell technology has drawn much attention from scientists and
   engineers due to its high energy conversion efficiency, quick start-up
   in the beginning of operation, portability, and minimal pollution.
   Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) play an important role in the fuel cell
   systems. A good PEM must meet a series of requirements such as high
   proton conductivity, excellent mechanical strength and stability,
   chemical and electrochemical stability, low fuel or oxidant crossover,
   and be amenable for fabrication into membrane electrode assemblies. In
   this paper, we focus on the recent advances in development of novel PEMs
   that work well under elevated temperature and/or low relative humidity.
   All PEMs described in this paper are divided into three categories:
   polymeric, ceramic, and inorganic-organic composite membranes. The
   Nafion membrane with structural and compositional modifications is the
   most promising candidate that can adapt to high temperature and low
   relative humidity operating conditions. Ceramic and inorganic-organic
   composite membranes display some desired properties, but the development
   of these membranes is still in early stages and further in-depth studies
   are needed. Possible approaches focusing on (1) improvement of proton
   conductivity and (2) enhancement of mechanical and thermal stabilities
   to improve the performance of novel PEMs are also discussed. (C) 2012

Title = {{Uptake of silver nanoparticles and toxicity to early life stages of

Journal = {{AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY}},

Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{59-66}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with antimicrobial properties are perhaps
   the most deployed engineered nanomaterials in consumer products. Almost
   all AgNPs are coated with organic materials to enhance their dispersion
   in water. Contributions of coatings to the toxicity of NPs have received
   little attention. Studies using AgNPs with one of three different
   coating materials (citrate (Cit), gum arabic (GA), and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)) showed significantly different toxicity. GA
   AgNP proved to be the most toxic, while PVP and Cit AgNP exhibited
   similar and lower toxicity. However, all AgNPs were about three to ten
   times less toxic than AgNO3 when their toxicities were compared on a
   mass-concentration basis. Evidence for NP-specific toxicity was observed
   with longer time for initiation of toxicity and increased incidence of
   resultant spinal flexure of medaka exposed to AgNPs, compared to AgNO3.
   Hyperspectral imaging of 6 mu m paraffin sections of fish exposed to
   AgNPs revealed AgNPs and their aggregates in tissues of fish. Gill
   distribution was ubiquitous, while small amounts were found in other
   organs, including the liver and brain. AgNPs were observed regularly in
   the gut lumen, but rarely in mural elements and mesentery. These results
   suggest that while ingestion was common, gills were the principal sites
   of AgNP uptake. In conclusion, AgNPs is a source of toxic Ag ions, while
   itself contribute partially to its toxicity to fish, and which interact
   with skin surface and were taken up via the gills. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Turbulent transport efficiency and the ejection-sweep motion for
   momentum and heat on sloping terrain covered with vineyards}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{98-107}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In boundary layer flows, it is now recognized that the net momentum and
   mass exchange rates are dominated by the statistical properties of
   ejecting and sweeping motion often linked to the presence of coherent
   turbulent structures. Over vineyards, three main factors impact the
   transport properties of such coherent motion: presence of sloping
   terrain, variations in leaf area index (LAI) during the growing season,
   and thermal stratification. The effect of these factors on momentum and
   heat transport is explored for three vineyard sites situated on
   different slopes. All three sites experience similar seasonal variation
   in LAI and mean wind conditions. The analysis is carried out using a
   conventional quadrant analysis technique and is tested against two
   models approximating the joint probability density function (JPDF) of
   the flow variables. It is demonstrated that a Gaussian JPDF explains
   much of the updraft and downdraft statistical contributions to heat and
   momentum transport efficiencies for all three sites. An incomplete or
   truncated third-order cumulant expansion method (ICEM) of the JPDF that
   retains only the mixed moments and ignores the skewness contributions
   describes well all the key properties of ejections and sweeps for all
   slopes, LAI, and stability classes. The implication of these findings
   for diagnosing potential failures of gradient-diffusion theory over
   complex terrain is discussed. Because only lower order moments are
   needed to describe the main characteristics of the JPDF, the use of the
   Moving Equilibrium Hypothesis (MEH) to predict these moments from the
   locally measured sensible heat flux and friction velocity is explored.
   Provided the planar fit coordinate transformation is applied to the
   data, the MEH can describe these statistical moments at all three sites
   regardless of terrain slopes and LAI values. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) films were synthesized and
   investigated in vitro for their potential use as a neural stimulation

   oxidation in O-2 at various temperatures and over a wide frequency
   range. The results showed distinct EC behavior within three ranges of
   treatment temperature. Oxidative thermal treatments that did not visibly
   etch the VACNT film caused a significant improvement in electrode
   performance compared to the as-deposited electrode. Surprisingly, flash
   oxidation within a narrow temperature range (400 < T <= 450 degrees C)
   selectively increased capacitance/charge injection at high frequencies
   (10(2)-10(4) Hz). A phenomenological model is proposed to explain the

Abstract = {{Graphene is emerging as a promising material for plasmonics applications
   due to its strong lightmatter interactions, most of which are
   theoretically predicted but not yet experimentally realized. Therefore,
   the integration of plasmonic nanoparticles to create metal
   nanoparticle/graphene composites enables numerous phenomena important
   for a range of applications from photonics to catalysis. For these
   applications it is important to articulate the coupling of photon-based
   excitations such as the interaction between plasmons in each of the
   material components, as well as their charge-based interactions
   dependent upon the energy alignment at the metal/graphene interface.
   These coupled phenomena underpin an active application area in
   graphene-based composites due to nanoparticle-dependent surface-enhanced
   Raman scattering (SERS) of graphene phonon modes. This study reveals the
   coupling of a graphene/SiC support with Ga-nanoparticle-localized
   surface plasmon resonance, which is of particular interest due to its
   ability to be tuned across the UV into the near-IR region. This work is
   the first demonstration of the evolving plasmon resonance on graphene
   during the synthesis of surface-supported metal nanoparticles, thus
   providing evidence for the theoretically predicted screening revealed by
   a damped resonance with little energy shift. Therefore, the role of the
   graphene/substrate heterojunction in tailoring the plasmon resonance for
   nanoplasmonic applications is shown. Additionally, the coupled phenomena
   between the grapheneGa plasmon properties, charge transfer, and SERS of
   graphene vibrational modes are explored.}},

Abstract = {{Here we show theoretically that swimming animals and athletes gain an
   advantage in force and speed by spreading their fingers and toes
   optimally. The larger force means larger body mass lifted and greater
   speed, in accord with the constructal theory of all animal locomotion.
   The spacing between fingers must be twice the thickness of the boundary
   layer around one finger. This theoretical prediction is confirmed by
   computational fluid dynamics simulations of flow across two and four
   cylinders of diameter D. The optimal spacing is in the range 0.2D-0.4D,
   and decreases slightly as the Reynolds number (Re) increases from 20 to
   100. For example, the total force exerted by two optimally spaced
   cylinders exceeds by 53\% the total force of two cylinders with no
   spacing when Re=20. These design features hold for both time-dependent
   and steady-state flows. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels are used as scaffolds for tissue engineering(1), vehicles for
   drug delivery(2), actuators for optics and fluidics(3), and model
   extracellular matrices for biological studies(4). The scope of hydrogel
   applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical
   behaviour(5). Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for
   example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times
   its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels(6,7) have achieved
   stretches in the range 10-20, but these values are markedly reduced in
   samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture
   energies of about 10 J m(-2) (ref. 8), as compared with similar to 1,000
   J m(-2) for cartilage(9) and similar to 10,000 J m(-2) for natural
   rubbers(10). Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with
   improved mechanical properties(11-18); certain synthetic gels have
   reached fracture energies of 100-1,000 J m(-2) (refs 11, 14, 17). Here
   we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and
   covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain similar to
   90\% water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length,
   and have fracture energies of similar to 9,000 J m(-2). Even for samples
   containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the
   gels' toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the
   network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network
   of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks
   preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large
   deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause
   internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as
   model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy
   dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications.}},

Abstract = {{The fouling resistance of oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG)-terminated
   self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiolates on gold has been
   well established. Although hydration of the OEG chains seems key to
   OEG-SAM resistance to macromolecular adsorption and cellular attachment,
   the details of how hydration prevents biofouling have been inferred
   largely through computational methods. Because OEG-SAMs of different
   lengths exhibit differing degrees of fouling resistance, the
   interactions between water and OEG-SAMs leading of fouling resistance
   can be deduced by comparing the properties of fouling and nonfouling
   OEG-SAMs. While all OEG-SAMs had similar water contact angles, contact
   angles taken with glycerol were able to individuate between different
   OEG-SAMs and between fouling and nonfouling OEG-SAMs. Subsequent
   estimation of surface and interfacial tension using a colloidal model
   showed that nonfouling surfaces are associated with an increased
   negative interfacial tension between those OEG-SAMs that resisted
   attachment and water. Further analysis of this interfacial tension
   experimentally confirmed current mathematical models that cite OEG-water
   hydrogen-bond formation as a driving force behind short-term fouling
   resistance. Finally, we found a correlation between solid-water
   interfacial tension and packing density and molecular density of
   ethylene glycol.}},

Journal = {{ECOHYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{550-562}},

Abstract = {{We analyse the equilibrium states and transient dynamics of tidal
   biogeomorphic systems, such as lagoons and estuaries, in response to
   variations in the governing physical and biological forcings, such as
   tidal range, wind climate, sediment supply, vegetation, and
   microphytobenthos growth, and rates of relative sea level rise (RSLR).
   We use a point model of the coupled elevationvegetation dynamics, which
   retains the description of the chief processes shaping these systems. We
   observe that salt marshes exposed to large tidal ranges are more stable,
   and therefore more resilient to increasing rates of RSLR, than marshes
   subjected to low tidal ranges. Furthermore, subtidal platforms in
   macrotidal systems are less exposed to wind-induced erosion processes
   than their counterparts in systems with smaller tidal fluctuations.
   Notably, we find that vegetation crucially affects both the equilibrium
   marsh elevation, through dissipation of wind waves and organic
   accumulation, and marsh resilience to accelerations in RSLR rates.
   Moreover, the biomass production as a function of elevation associated
   with the presence of different vegetation species, as opposed to
   mono-specific vegetation covers, increases marsh stability and
   resilience in the face of increasing rates of RSLR. Finally, our results
   show that the existence and stability of equilibrium states
   fundamentally depend on the local wind and tidal regime, even within the
   same tidal system, with important biogeomorphic implications. In
   summary, our model analyses of physical and biological controls of tidal
   system dynamics highlight the importance of accounting for biogeomorphic
   feedback to obtain realistic representations of the system dynamics in
   response to climatic changes. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. An intracanalicular scaffold (Hydrus microstent) designed to
   reduce intraocular pressure as a glaucoma treatment was tested in human
   anterior segments to determine changes in outflow facility (C).
   METHODS. Human eyes with no history of ocular disease or surgeries were
   perfused within 49 hours of death. The anterior segments were isolated
   and connected to a perfusion system. Flow rates were measured at
   pressures of 10, 20, 30, and 40 mm Hg. The scaffold was inserted into
   Schlemm's canal of the experimental eye, while a control eye underwent a
   sham procedure. Flow rate measurements were repeated at the four
   pressure levels. Individual C values were computed by dividing the flow
   rate by its corresponding pressure, and by averaging the four individual
   C measurements. The change in C between control and experimental eyes
   was assessed by the ratio of the baseline and second C measurement. In
   two eyes, the placement of the scaffold was evaluated histologically.
   RESULTS. After scaffold implantation in the experimental eyes, the
   average C increased significantly from baseline (n = 9, P < 0.05).
   Ratios of C at all pressure levels, except for 10 mm Hg, were
   significantly higher in experimental eyes (n = 9) than control eyes (P <
   0.05, n = 7). Histologically, the scaffold dilated Schlemm's canal with
   no visible damage to the trabecular meshwork.
   CONCLUSIONS. The Hydrus Microstent provided an effective way to increase
   outflow facility in human eyes ex vivo. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.

Abstract = {{The survival of cells and organisms requires proper responses to
   environmental signals. These responses are governed by cellular
   networks, which serve to process diverse environmental cues. Biological
   networks often contain recurring network topologies called ``motifs{''}.
   It has been recognized that the study of such motifs allows one to
   predict the response of a biological network and thus cellular behavior.
   However, studying a single motif in complete isolation of all other
   network motifs in a natural setting is difficult. Synthetic biology has
   emerged as a powerful approach to understanding the dynamic properties
   of network motifs. In addition to testing existing theoretical
   predictions, construction and analysis of synthetic gene circuits has
   led to the discovery of novel motif dynamics, such as how the
   combination of simple motifs can lead to autonomous dynamics or how
   noise in transcription and translation can affect the dynamics of a
   motif. Here, we review developments in synthetic biology as they pertain
   to increasing our understanding of cellular information processing. We
   highlight several types of dynamic behaviors that diverse motifs can
   generate, including the control of input/output responses, the
   generation of autonomous spatial and temporal dynamics, as well as the
   influence of noise in motif dynamics and cellular behavior.}},

   power to both corneal topography and Scheimpflug photography in normal

Abstract = {{Vibrational energy harvesters are often linear mass-spring-damper-type
   devices, which have their resonant frequency tuned to the dominant
   vibration frequency of their host environment. As such, they can be
   highly sensitive to uncertainties, which may arise from the imprecise
   characterization of the host environment or, alternatively, from
   manufacturing defects and tolerances. It has previously been claimed
   that the use of nonlinear energy harvesters may be one way to alleviate
   the problems of these uncertainties. This article presents a systematic
   uncertainty propagation study of a prototypical electromagnetic energy
   harvester. More specifically, the response of a linear harvester in the
   presence of parametric uncertainty is compared to the response of
   harvesters containing some common forms of nonlinearity, that is,
   hardening, softening, or bistability. Analytical solutions are used in
   combination with presumed levels of parametric uncertainty to quantify
   the resulting uncertainty in the power output. Consequently, these
   studies can determine the regions in the parameter space where a
   nonlinear strategy may outperform a more traditional linear approach.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Febrile status epilepticus (FSE) has been associated with
   hippocampal injury and subsequent hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and
   temporal lobe epilepsy. The FEBSTAT study was designed to prospectively
   examine the association between prolonged febrile seizures and
   development of HS and associated temporal lobe epilepsy, one of the most
   controversial issues in epilepsy. We report on the baseline
   phenomenology of the final cohorts as well as detailed aims and
   methodology. Methods: The Consequences of Prolonged Febrile Seizures in
   Childhood (FEBSTAT) study is a prospective, multicenter study. Enrolled
   are children, aged 1 month to 6 years of age, presenting with a febrile
   seizure lasting 30 min or longer based on ambulance, emergency
   department, and hospital records, and parental interview. At baseline,
   procedures included a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study and
   electroencephalography (EEG) recording done within 72 h of FSE, and a
   detailed history and neurologic examination. Baseline development and
   behavior are assessed at 1 month. The baseline assessment is repeated,
   with age-appropriate developmental testing at 1 and 5 years after
   enrollment as well as at the development of epilepsy and 1 year after
   that. Telephone calls every 3 months document additional seizures. Two
   other groups of children are included: a control group consisting of
   children with a first febrile seizure ascertained at Columbia University
   and with almost identical baseline and 1-year follow-up examinations and
   a pilot cohort of FSE from Duke University. Key Findings: The FEBSTAT
   cohort consists of 199 children with a median age at baseline of 16.0
   months (interquartile range {[}IQR] 12.024.0) and a median duration of
   FSE of 70.0 min (IQR 47.0110.0). Seizures were continuous in 57.3\% and
   behaviorally intermittent (without recovery in between) in 31.2\%; most
   were partial (2.0\%) or secondary generalized (65.8\%), and almost all
   (98.0\%) culminated in a generalized tonicclonic seizure. Of the 199
   children, 86.4\% had normal development and 20\% had prior febrile
   seizures. In one third of cases, FSE was unrecognized in the emergency
   department. The Duke existing cohort consists of 23 children with a
   median age of FSE onset of 18.0 months (IQR 14.028.0) and median
   duration of FSE of 90.0 min (IQR 50.0170.0). The Columbia control cohort
   consists of 159 children with a first febrile seizure who received
   almost the same workup as the FEBSTAT cohort at baseline and at 1 year.
   They were followed by telephone every 4 months for a median of 42
   months. Among the control cohort, 64.2\% had a first simple FS, 26.4\%
   had a first complex FS that was not FSE, and 9.4\% had FSE. Among the 15
   with FSE, the median age at onset was 14.0 months (IQR 12.020.0) and the
   median duration of FSE was 43.0 min (IQR 35.075.0). Significance: The
   FEBSTAT study presents an opportunity to prospectively study the
   relationship between FSE and acute hippocampal damage, the development
   of mesial temporal sclerosis, epilepsy (particularly temporal lobe
   epilepsy), and impaired hippocampal function in a large cohort. It is
   hoped that this study may illuminate a major mystery in clinical
   epilepsy today, and permit the development of interventions designed to
   prevent the sequelae of FSE.}},

Abstract = {{The unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat model is
   frequently used to study the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep
   brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
   However, systematic knowledge of the effects of DBS parameters on
   behavior in this animal model is lacking. The goal of this study was to
   characterize the effects of DBS on methamphetamine-induced circling in
   the unilateral 6-OHDA lesioned rat. DBS parameters tested include
   stimulation amplitude, stimulation frequency, methamphetamine dose,
   stimulation polarity, and anatomical location of the electrode. When an
   appropriate stimulation amplitude and dose of methamphetamine were
   applied, high-frequency stimulation (>130 Hz), but not low frequency
   stimulation (<10 Hz), reversed the bias in ipsilateral circling without
   inhibiting movement. This characteristic frequency tuning profile was
   only generated when at least one electrode used during bipolar
   stimulation was located within the STN. No difference was found between
   bipolar stimulation and monopolar stimulation when the most effective
   electrode contact was selected, indicating that monopolar stimulation
   could be used in future experiments. Methamphetamine-induced circling is
   a simple, reliable, and sensitive behavioral test and holds potential
   for high-throughput study of the effects of STN DBS in unilaterally
   lesioned rats.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a hybrid technique in time domain that combines the
   explicit finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and the implicit
   finite-element time-domain (FETD) method based on the discontinuous
   Galerkin method to analyze transient electromagnetic problems. In the
   hybrid method, the FETD part uses the unconditionally stable
   CrankNicholson method with a triangular mesh, whereas the standard FDTD
   part employs a staggered Cartesian grid for spatial discretization and
   the leap-frog scheme for time stepping. Nonconforming meshes are allowed
   between the structured FDTD grid and unstructured FETD meshes. The
   hybrid method takes advantages of the modeling flexibility of the FETD
   method for complex structures and the efficiency of the FDTD method for
   simple structures. The hybrid implicitexplicit time-stepping scheme
   allows a time-step increment as large as the stability limit for the
   FDTD method, which can be much larger than the stability criterion of
   the explicit FETD scheme with small elements. The hybrid scheme has
   second-order accuracy. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of
   the proposed method. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   integrated readout and active tip (FIRAT) probe is used. Simulation
   results indicate that the active and damped nature of FIRAT provides a
   significant level of control over the force applied to the sample,
   minimizing sample indentation and topography error. Active tip control
   (ATC) preserves constant contact time during force control for stable
   contact while preventing the loss of material property information such
   as elasticity and adhesive force. Simulation results are verified by
   TRIF mode imaging of the samples with both soft and stiff regions. (C)

Abstract = {{Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare, autosomal dominant inherited
   disorder characterized by gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and
   pigmented mucocutaneous lesions. Intussusceptions and gastrointestinal
   tract bleeding are frequent complications of PJS caused by larger
   polyps, but acute pancreatitis and splenomegaly are very rare.
   Previously, surgical intervention was the only curative modality despite
   the associated complications. In recent years, double-balloon
   enteroscopy (DBE) has become the alternative method as the ideal
   treatment. We report the case of a 20-year-old woman diagnosed with PJS,
   as she suffered from 4-day nausea and vomiting with acute abdominal
   pain, and clinically manifested acute pancreatitis, splenomegaly and
   duodenojejunal intussusceptions secondary to a huge proximal jejunal
   polyp (10 cm x 2 cm). We removed the polyp via DBE and found that the
   acute pancreatitis, splenomegaly and duodenojejunal intussusceptions
   were simultaneously ameliorated 2 days after treatment. Currently, the
   patient has been symptom free for 3 months after polypectomy. Acute
   pancreatitis, splenomegaly and intussusceptions can synchronously occur
   in PJS patients, and polypectomy via DBE is the effective treatment
   alternative to surgical intervention for this disease, thereby obviating
   some complications associated with the latter.}},

   varying organic carbon substrates, initial recipient-to-donor cell
   density ratios, and mixtures of known recipient bacterial strains on the
   conjugation and function of a TOL plasmid were tested in sterile soil
   slurry batch reactors. The presence of soil organic carbon was
   sufficient in ensuring TOL plasmid transconjugant occurrence (up to 2.1
   +/- 0.5\%) for most recipient strains in soil slurry batch mating
   experiments. The addition of glucose had limited effects on
   transconjugant occurrence; however, glucose amendment increased the
   specific toluene degradation rates of some Enterobacteriaceae
   transconjugants in soil slurry. Initial cell density ratios and mixtures
   of recipient strains had smaller impacts on plasmid conjugation and
   resulting phenotype functionality. These observations suggest that
   genetic bioaugmentation may be improved by minimal altering of

Abstract = {{Although the release of nitric oxide (NO) from biomaterials has been
   shown to reduce the foreign body response (FBR), the optimal NO release
   kinetics and doses remain unknown. Herein, polyurethane-coated wire
   substrates with varying NO release properties were implanted into
   porcine subcutaneous tissue for 3, 7, 21 and 42 d. Histological analysis
   revealed that materials with short NO release durations (i.e., 24 h)
   were insufficient to reduce the collagen capsule thickness at 3 and 6
   weeks, whereas implants with longer release durations (i.e., 3 and 14 d)
   and greater NO payloads significantly reduced the collagen encapsulation
   at both 3 and 6 weeks. The acute inflammatory response was mitigated
   most notably by systems with the longest duration and greatest dose of
   NO release, supporting the notion that these properties are most
   critical in circumventing the FBR for subcutaneous biomedical
   applications (e.g., glucose sensors). (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   design takes the SoC layout into consideration and facilitates the
   sharing of test wires between pre-bond tests and post-bond test, which
   significantly reduces the routing cost for test-access mechanisms. In
   addition, a thermal-aware test scheduling algorithm is proposed to
   eliminate hot spots during manufacturing test. Experimental results for
   the ITC'02 SoC benchmarks circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{Metals support surface plasmons at optical wavelengths and have the
   ability to localize light to subwavelength regions. The field
   enhancements that occur in these regions set the ultimate limitations on
   a wide range of nonlinear and quantum optical phenomena. We found that
   the dominant limiting factor is not the resistive loss of the metal, but
   rather the intrinsic nonlocality of its dielectric response. A
   semiclassical model of the electronic response of a metal places strict
   bounds on the ultimate field enhancement. To demonstrate the accuracy of

Abstract = {{G protein-coupled receptor kinase interacting protein 2 (GIT2) is a
   signaling scaffold protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal
   structure, membrane trafficking, and G protein-coupled receptor
   internalization. Since dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization plays key
   roles both in osteoblast differentiation and in the maintenance of
   osteoclast polarity during bone resorption, we hypothesized that
   skeletal physiology would be altered in GIT2(-/-) mice. We found that
   adult GIT2(-/-) mice have decreased bone mineral density and bone volume
   in both the trabecular and cortical compartments. This osteopenia was
   associated with decreased numbers of mature osteoblasts, diminished
   osteoblastic activity, and increased marrow adiposity, suggesting a
   defect in osteoblast maturation. In vitro, mesenchymal stem cells
   derived from GIT2(-/-) mice exhibited impaired differentiation into
   osteoblasts and increased adipocyte differentiation, consistent with a
   role for GIT2 in mesenchymal stem cell fate determination. Despite
   elevated osteoclast inducing cytokines and osteoclast numbers, GIT2(-/-)
   mice also exhibit impaired bone resorption, consistent with a further
   role for GIT2 in regulating osteoclast function. Collectively, these
   findings underscore the importance of the cytoskeleton in both
   osteoblast and osteoclast function and demonstrate that GIT2 plays
   essential roles in skeletal metabolism, affecting both bone formation
   and bone resorption in vivo. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Single-stranded DNA immobilized on an III-V semiconductor is a potential
   high-sensitivity biosensor. The chemical and electronic changes
   occurring upon the binding of DNA to the InAs surface are essential to
   understanding the DNA-immobilization mechanism. In this work, the
   chemical properties of DNA-immobilized InAs surfaces were determined
   through high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
   near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). Prior to DNA
   functionalization, HF- and NH4OH- based aqueous etches were used to
   remove the native oxide from the InAs surface. The initial chemical
   state of the surface resulting from these etches were characterized
   prior to functionalization. F-tagged thiolated single-stranded DNA
   (ssDNA) was used as the probe species under two different
   functionalization methods. The presence of DNA immobilized on the
   surface was confirmed from the F Is, N Is, and P 2p peaks in the XPS
   spectra. The presence of salt had a profound effect on the density of
   immobilized DNA on the InAs surface. To study the interfacial chemistry,
   the surface was treated with thiolated ssDNA with and without the
   mercaptohexanol molecule. An analysis of the As 3d and In 3d spectra
   indicates that both In S and As S are present on the surface after DNA
   functionalization. The amount of In S and As S was determined by the
   functionalization method as well as the presence of mercaptohexanol
   during functionalization. The orientation of the adsorbed ssDNA is
   determined by polarization-dependent NEXAFS utilizing the N K-edge. The
   immobilized ssDNA molecule has a preferred tilt angle with respect to
   the substrate normal, but with a random azimuthal distribution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides the first comparison of the semi-discretization,
   spectral element, and Legendre collocation methods. Each method is a
   technique for solving delay differential equations (DDEs) as well as
   determining regions of stability in the DDE parameter space. We present
   the necessary concepts, assumptions, and equations required to implement
   each method. To compare the relative performance between the methods,
   the convergence rate and computational time for each method is compared
   in three numerical studies consisting of a ship stability example, the
   delayed damped Mathieu equation, and a helicopter rotor control problem.
   For each study, we present one or more stability diagrams in the
   parameter space and one or more convergence plots. The spectral element
   method is demonstrated to have the quickes convergence rate while the
   Legendre collocation method requires the least computational time. The
   semi-discretization method on the other hand has both the slowest
   convergence rate and requires the most computational time. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Flexible electronics opened a new class of future electronics. The
   foldable, light and durable nature of flexible electronics allows vast
   flexibility in applications such as display, energy devices and mobile
   electronics. Even though conventional electronics fabrication methods
   are well developed for rigid substrates, direct application or slight
   modification of conventional processes for flexible electronics
   fabrication cannot work. The future flexible electronics fabrication
   requires totally new low-temperature process development optimized for
   flexible substrate and it should be based on new material too. Here we
   present a simple approach to developing a flexible electronics
   fabrication without using conventional vacuum deposition and
   photolithography. We found that direct metal patterning based on
   laser-induced local melting of metal nanoparticle ink is a promising
   low-temperature alternative to vacuum deposition- and
   photolithography-based conventional metal patterning processes. The
   ``digital{''} nature of the proposed direct metal patterning process
   removes the need for expensive photomask and allows easy design
   modification and short turnaround time. This new process can be
   extremely useful for current small-volume, large-variety manufacturing
   paradigms. Besides, simple, scalable, fast and low-temperature processes
   can lead to cost-effective fabrication methods on a large-area polymer
   substrate. The developed process was successfully applied to demonstrate
   high-quality Ag patterning (2.1 mu Omega.cm) and high-performance
   flexible organic field effect transistor arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are metacognitive: they monitor and control their cognition. Our
   hypothesis was that neuronal correlates of metacognition reside in the
   same brain areas responsible for cognition, including frontal cortex.
   Recent work demonstrated that nonhuman primates are capable of
   metacognition, so we recorded from single neurons in the frontal eye
   field, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and supplementary eye field of
   monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that performed a metacognitive
   visual-oculomotor task. The animals made a decision and reported it with
   a saccade, but received no immediate reward or feedback. Instead, they
   had to monitor their decision and bet whether it was correct. Activity
   was correlated with decisions and bets in all three brain areas, but
   putative metacognitive activity that linked decisions to appropriate
   bets occurred exclusively in the SEF. Our results offer a survey of
   neuronal correlates of metacognition and implicate the SEF in linking
   cognitive functions over short periods of time.}},

Abstract = {{Development of effective, yet safe, antithrombotic agents has been
   challenging because such agents increase the propensity of patients to
   bleed. Recently, naturally occurring polyphosphates such as
   extracellular DNA, RNA, and inorganic polyphosphates have been shown to
   activate blood coagulation. In this report, we evaluate the
   anticoagulant and antithrombotic activity of nucleic acid-binding
   polymers in vitro and in vivo. Such polymers bind to DNA, RNA, and
   inorganic polyphosphate molecules with high affinity and inhibit RNA-
   and polyphosphate-induced clotting and the activation of the intrinsic
   pathway of coagulation in vitro. Moreover, {[}NH2(CH2)(2)NH2]: (G = 3);
   dendri PAMAM(NH2)(32) (PA-MAM G-3) prevents thrombosis following carotid
   artery injury and pulmonary thromboembolism in mice without
   significantly increasing blood loss from surgically challenged animals.
   These studies indicate that nucleic acid-binding polymers are able to
   scavenge effectively prothrombotic nucleic acids and other
   polyphosphates in vivo and represent a new and potentially safer class
   of antithrombotic agents.}},

   review the concept of transformation optics that manipulates electric

Abstract = {{Background-Cardiac cell therapies can yield electric coupling of
   unexcitable donor cells to host cardiomyocytes with functional
   consequences that remain unexplored.
   Methods and Results-We micropatterned cell pairs consisting of a
   neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) coupled to an engineered human
   embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell expressing either connexin-43 (Cx43
   HEK) or inward rectifier potassium channel 2.1 (Kir2.1) and Cx43
   (Kir2.1+Cx43 HEK). The NRVM-HEK contact length was fixed yielding a
   coupling strength of 68.9 +/- 9.7 nS, whereas HEK size was
   systematically varied. With increase in Cx43 HEK size, NRVM maximal
   diastolic potential was reduced from -71.7 +/- 0.6 mV in single NRVMs to
   -35.1 +/- 1.3 mV in pairs with an HEK: NRVM cell surface area ratio of
   1.7 +/- 0.1, whereas the action potential upstroke ({[}dV(m)/dt](max))
   and duration decreased to 1.6 +/- 0.7\% and increased to 177 +/- 32\% in
   single NRVM values, respectively (n=21 cell pairs). Pacemaking occurred
   in all NRVM-Cx43 HEK pairs with cell surface area ratios of 1.1 to 1.9.
   In contrast, NRVMs, coupled with Kir2.1+Cx43 HEKs of increasing size,
   had similar maximal diastolic potentials, exhibited no spontaneous
   activity, and showed a gradual decrease in action potential duration
   (n=23). Furthermore, coupling single NRVMs to a dynamic clamp model of
   HEK cell ionic current reproduced the cardiac maximal diastolic
   potentials and pacemaking rates recorded in cell pairs, whereas
   reproducing changes in (dV(m)/dt)(max) and action potential duration
   required coupling to an HEK model that also included cell membrane
   capacitance.
   Conclusions-Size and ionic currents of unexcitable cells electrically
   coupled to cardiomyocytes distinctly affect cardiac action potential
   shape and initiation with important implications for the safety of
   cardiac cell and gene therapies. (Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol.

Abstract = {{To assess whether a scan triggering technique based on the slope of the
   time-attenuation curve combined with table speed optimization may
   improve arterial enhancement in aortic CT angiography compared to
   conventional threshold-based triggering techniques. Measurements of
   arterial enhancement were performed in a physiologic flow phantom over a
   range of simulated cardiac outputs (2.2-8.1 L/min) using contrast media
   boluses of 80 and 150 mL injected at 4 mL/s. These measurements were
   used to construct computer models of aortic attenuation in CT
   angiography, using cardiac output, aortic diameter, and CT table speed
   as input parameters. In-plane enhancement was calculated for normal and
   aneurysmal aortic diameters. Calculated arterial enhancement was poor (<
   150 HU) along most of the scan length using the threshold-based
   triggering technique for low cardiac outputs and the aneurysmal aorta
   model. Implementation of the slope-based triggering technique with table
   speed optimization improved enhancement in all scenarios and yielded
   good- (> 200 HU; 13/16 scenarios) to excellent-quality (> 300 HU; 3/16
   scenarios) enhancement in all cases. Slope-based triggering with table
   speed optimization may improve the technical quality of aortic CT
   angiography over conventional threshold-based techniques, and may reduce
   technical failures related to low cardiac output and slow flow through
   an aneurysmal aorta.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The study was designed to determine trabecular meshwork (TM)
   stiffness and its relationship to outflow facility (C) in perfused
   normal human and porcine eyes.
   METHODS. Human and porcine eyes were perfused at pressures of 10, 20,
   30, and 40 mm Hg to determine C and how outflow resistance (R = 1/C)
   varied with the pressure. Following perfusions, TM tissue segments were
   dissected and stretched uniaxially to determine the circumferential bulk
   Young's modulus (E). The statistical significance of difference between
   different groups was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t-test or
   Mann-Whitney U test.
   RESULTS. A larger E correlated with a higher C measured at 10 and 20 mm
   Hg (P < 0.05), and a similar trend was observed at 30 and 40 mm Hg in
   human eyes (n = 7). Additionally, a higher C correlated to a lower
   variance of R, and a stiffer TM correlated to a lower variance of R in
   human eyes (P < 0.05). For porcine TM, E was inversely correlated to a
   cross-sectional area (P < 0.003, n = 11), and its value (24.9 and 1.5
   kPa; geometric mean and geometric SE) was lower than E of human TM (515
   +/- 136 kPa; mean +/- SE) (P < 0.01). C and variance of R were not
   significantly different between the species.
   CONCLUSIONS. A higher circumferential stiffness of the TM correlated
   with a higher outflow facility and less IOP elevation-induced variation
   in outflow resistance in normal human eyes, but not in porcine eyes. For
   future studies, these correlations need to be evaluated in glaucomatous
   eyes to better understand normal and abnormal TM functions. (Invest

Abstract = {{Time-of-flight methods allow quantitative measurement of shear wave
   speed (SWS) from ultrasonically tracked displacements following
   impulsive acoustic radiation force excitation in tissue. In
   heterogeneous materials, reflections at boundaries can distort the wave
   shape and confound determination of the wave arrival time. The magnitude
   of these effects depends on the shear wavelength of the excitation, the
   kernel size used to calculate the SWS, and the method used to determine
   the wave arrival time. In this study, we perform a parametric analysis
   of these factors using finite element modeling of the tissue response
   and simulated ultrasonic tracking. Two geometries are used, a stiff
   vertical layer and a stiff spherical inclusion, each in a uniform
   background. Wave arrival times are estimated using the peak
   displacement, peak slope of the leading edge, and cross-correlation
   methods. Results are evaluated in terms of reconstruction accuracy,
   resolution, contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio of reconstructed SWS
   images. Superior results are obtained using narrower excitation widths
   and arrival time estimators which identify the leading edge of the
   propagating wave. The optimal kernel size is determined by a tradeoff
   between improved accuracy for larger kernels at the expense of spatial
   resolution.}},

   doi:10.1152/jn.00236.2012.-Salt appetite is a goal-directed behavior in
   which salt-deprived animals ingest high salt concentrations that they
   otherwise find aversive. Because forebrain areas such as the lateral
   hypothalamus (LH), central amygdala (CeA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc)
   are known to play an important role in this behavior, we recorded from
   these areas while water-deprived (WD) and salt-deprived (SD) rats
   performed a two-bottle choice test between 0.5 M salt (NaCl) and 0.4 M
   sucrose. In the SD state, the preference ratio for high molar salt
   markedly increased. Electrophysiological recordings analyzed with
   respect to the onset of licking clusters revealed the presence of both
   excitatory and inhibitory neuronal responses during salt and/or sucrose
   consumption. In the NAc, putative medium spiny neurons and tonically
   active neurons exhibited excitatory and inhibitory responses. In all
   areas, compared with those recorded during the WD state, neurons
   recorded during the SD state showed an increase in the percentage of
   salt-evoked excitatory responses and a decrease in the percentage of
   sucrose-evoked inhibitory responses, suggesting that a subset of the
   neuronal population in these areas codes for the increased motivational
   and/or hedonic value of the salt solution. In addition, in the SD state,
   the firing of excitatory neurons in LH and CeA became more synchronized,
   indicating a greater functional connectivity between salt-responsive
   neurons in these areas. We propose that plastic changes in the
   feeding-related neuronal populations of these forebrain areas arise when
   changes in metabolic state alter the hedonic and motivational value of a
   particular taste stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{This brief paper investigates the optimal selection of online
   controllers for a linear system with actuator faults in the framework of
   H-infinity control. The occurrence of actuator faults is modeled as a
   Markov chain to predict future faults. A compatible relationship of
   H-infinity controllers is proposed for successive fault modes. In order
   to shrink the set of all H-infinity controllers, seven methods are
   presented to construct a small set of controllers for different demands.
   Then five selection schemes are proposed to choose a proper controller
   from a given set of controllers for a given fault mode. Another
   selection scheme and a pre-selection scheme are presented when there
   might be false fault detection and identification. Considered together,
   they provide a powerful solution for all kinds of demands. A motivating
   example is used to illustrate the proposed methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The theological properties of cysteine-containing elastin-like
   polypeptide (Cys-ELP) solutions and Cys-ELP hydrogels are reported. The
   Cys-ELP solutions exhibit a surprisingly high apparent viscosity at low
   shear rate. The high viscosity is attributed to the formation of an
   interfacial cross-linked ``skin{''} at the sample surface, rather than
   the bulk of the Cys-ELP solution. At higher shear rate, the interfacial
   cross-linked film breaks, and its influence on the viscosity of the
   Cys-ELP solution can be ignored. Cys-ELP hydrogels are formed by mixing
   Cys-ELP and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). At fixed concentration of Cys-ELP,
   the gelation time can be tuned by the concentration of H2O2. Cys-ELP
   hydrogels have the typical characteristics of covalent cross linked
   networks, as the storage moduli are larger than the loss moduli and are
   independent of frequency in dynamic oscillatory frequency sweep
   experiments. The plateau moduli obtained from linear frequency sweep
   experiments are much lower than those estimated from the limber of thiol
   groups along the Cys-ELP chain, indicating that only a small fraction of
   thiols form elastically active cross links From the small value of the
   fraction of elastically active cross links, the Cys-ELP hydrogel is
   concluded to be an inhomogenous network. Under steady shear, a 2.5 wt \%
   Cys-ELP hydrogel shear thickens at shear rates lower than that necessary
   for fracture.}},

   (CRBs) of direction-of-arrival and distance estimation with a single

   estimation accuracy of the acoustic vector sensor in the near-field,
   through the CRBs analysis, by modelling the incident source as: (i) a
   Gaussian distributed random sequence, and (ii) a polynomial-phase
   signal. All the four different compositions of the acoustic vector
   sensor in the near-field are considered, and their `closed-form' CRBs
   are derived.}},

Abstract = {{Many biological structures of interest are beyond the diffraction limit
   of conventional microscopes and their visualization requires application
   of super-resolution techniques. Such techniques have found remarkable
   success in surpassing the diffraction limit to achieve sub-diffraction
   limited resolution; however, they are predominantly limited to
   fluorescent samples. Here, we introduce a non-fluorescent analogue to
   structured illumination microscopy, termed structured oblique
   illumination microscopy (SOIM), where we use simultaneous oblique
   illuminations of the sample to multiplex high spatial-frequency content
   into the frequency support of the system. We introduce a theoretical
   framework describing how to demodulate this multiplexed information to
   reconstruct an image with a spatial-frequency support exceeding that of
   the system's classical diffraction limit. This approach allows
   enhanced-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent samples. Experimental
   confirmation of the approach is obtained in a reflection test target
   with moderate numerical aperture. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A four-phase integrated buck converter in 45 nm silicon-on-insulator

   transients. This fast control approach reduces the required output
   capacitance by 5 in comparison to a conventional, latched PWM controller
   at a similar operating point. The converter switches package-integrated
   air-core inductors at 80 MHz and delivers 1 A/mm(2) at 83\% efficiency
   and 0.66 conversion ratio. A network-on-chip (NoC) serves as a realistic
   digital load along with a programmable current source capable of
   generating load current steps with slew rate of similar to 1 A/100 ps

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology for detecting anomalies from
   sequentially observed and potentially noisy data. The proposed approach
   consists of two main elements: 1) filtering, or assigning a belief or
   likelihood to each successive measurement based upon our ability to
   predict it from previous noisy observations and 2) hedging, or flagging
   potential anomalies by comparing the current belief against a
   time-varying and data-adaptive threshold. The threshold is adjusted
   based on the available feedback from an end user. Our algorithms, which
   combine universal prediction with recent work on online convex
   programming, do not require computing posterior distributions given all
   current observations and involve simple primal-dual parameter updates.
   At the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models
   which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and
   which yield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both
   static and slowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn
   from the same exponential family. Moreover, the regret against static
   distributions coincides with the minimax value of the corresponding
   online strongly convex game. We also prove bounds on the number of
   mistakes made during the hedging step relative to the best offline
   choice of the threshold with access to all estimated beliefs and
   feedback signals. We validate the theory on synthetic data drawn from a
   time-varying distribution over binary vectors of high dimensionality, as
   well as on the Enron email dataset.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the question of sensor network coverage for a
   two-dimensional domain. We seek to compute the probability that a set of
   sensors fails to cover given only non-metric, local (who is talking to
   whom) information and a probability distribution of failure of each
   node. This builds on the work of de Silva and Ghrist who analyzed this
   problem in the deterministic situation. We first show that it is part of
   a slightly larger class of problems which is \#P-hard, and thus fast
   algorithms likely do not exist unless P = NP. The question of whether
   the specific problem is, in fact, \#P-hard remains open. We then give a
   deterministic algorithm which is feasible in the case of a small set of
   sensors, and give a dynamic algorithm for an arbitrary set of sensors
   failing over time which utilizes a new criterion for coverage to give an
   early warning of potential failure. These algorithms build on the theory
   of topological persistence.}},

Abstract = {{Attack tree (AT) is one of the widely used non-state-space models for
   security analysis. The basic formalism of AT does not take into account
   defense mechanisms. Defense trees (DTs) have been developed to
   investigate the effect of defense mechanisms using measures such as
   attack cost, security investment cost, return on attack (ROA), and
   return on investment (ROI). DT, however, places defense mechanisms only
   at the leaf nodes and the corresponding ROI/ROA analysis does not
   incorporate the probabilities of attack. In attack response tree (ART),
   attack and response are both captured but ART suffers from the problem
   of state-space explosion, since solution of ART is obtained by means of
   a state-space model. In this paper, we present a novel attack tree
   paradigm called attack countermeasure tree (ACT) which avoids the
   generation and solution of a state-space model and takes into account
   attacks as well as countermeasures (in the form of detection and
   mitigation events). In ACT, detection and mitigation are allowed not
   just at the leaf node but also at the intermediate nodes while at the
   same time the state-space explosion problem is avoided in its analysis.
   We study the consequences of incorporating countermeasures in the ACT
   using three case studies (ACT for BGP attack, ACT for a SCADA attack and
   ACT for malicious insider attacks). Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Statistically linearized optimal control of an electromagnetic vibratory
   energy harvester}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an extension of linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control
   theory is used to determine the optimal state feedback controller for a
   vibratory energy harvesting system with Coulomb friction. Specifically,
   the energy harvester is a base-excited single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF)
   resonant oscillator with an electromagnetic transducer attached between
   the base and the moving mass. The development of the optimal controller
   for this system is based on statistical linearization, whereby the
   Coulomb friction force is replaced by an equivalent linear viscous
   damping term, which is calculated from the stationary covariance of the
   closed-loop system. It is shown that the covariance matrix and optimal
   feedback gain matrix can be computed by implementing an iterative
   algorithm involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, this
   theory is augmented to account for a non-quadratic dissipation in the
   electronics used to control the energy conversion. Simulation results
   are presented for the SDOF energy harvester in which the performance of
   the optimal state feedback control law is compared to the performance of
   the optimal static admittance over a range of disturbance bandwidths.}},

Title = {{Optimal performance of constrained control systems}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to compute optimal open-loop trajectories
   for systems subject to state and control inequality constraints in which
   the cost function is quadratic and the state dynamics are linear. For
   the case in which inequality constraints are decentralized with respect
   to the controls, optimal Lagrange multipliers enforcing the inequality
   constraints may be found at any time through Pontryagin's minimum
   principle. In so doing, the set of differential algebraic Euler-Lagrange
   equations is transformed into a nonlinear two-point boundary-value
   problem for states and costates whose solution meets the necessary
   conditions for optimality. The optimal performance of inequality
   constrained control systems is calculable, allowing for comparison to
   previous, sub-optimal solutions. The method is applied to the control of
   damping forces in a vibration isolation system subjected to constraints
   imposed by the physical implementation of a particular controllable
   damper. An outcome of this study is the best performance achievable
   given a particular objective, isolation system, and semi-active damper
   constraints.}},

   analyzed: a small cube where the tree structure grows to the
   second-level bifurcation, and a larger cube where the tree design grows
   to fourth-level branches. We show that when the solid domain and growing
   tree structure do not interfere with each other, symmetry is a
   beneficial feature that promotes heat transfer. When the tree structure
   interferes with the boundaries, asymmetry is the better design feature,
   and because of it the tree structure fills the available conducting

Abstract = {{We developed new miniature ring array transducers integrated into

   catheter. We used a braided cabling technology from Tyco Electronics

   -6 dB fractional bandwidth of 20\% centered at 4.7 MHz without a
   matching layer vs. average bandwidth of 60\% centered at 4.4 MHz with a
   matching layer. Real-time 3-D rendered images of an en face view of a

Abstract = {{Under typical dark chest radiography reading room conditions, a
   radiologist's pupils contract and dilate as their visual focus
   intermittently shifts between the high luminance monitor and the darker
   background wall, resulting in increased visual fatigue and degradation
   of diagnostic performance. A controlled increase of ambient lighting may
   minimize these visual adjustments and potentially improve comfort and
   accuracy. This study was designed to determine the effect of a
   controlled increase of ambient lighting on chest radiologist nodule
   detection performance. Four chest radiologists read 100 radiographs (50
   normal and 50 containing a subtle nodule) under low (E = 1 lx) and
   elevated (E = 50 lx) ambient lighting levels on a DICOM-calibrated,
   medical-grade liquid crystal display. Radiologists were asked to
   identify nodule locations and rate their detection confidence. A
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of radiologist results
   was performed and area under ROC curve (AUC) values calculated for each
   ambient lighting level. Additionally, radiologist selection times under
   both illuminance conditions were determined. Average AUC values did not
   significantly differ (p > 0.05) between ambient lighting levels
   (estimated mean difference = -0.03; 95\% CI, (-0.08, 0.03)). Average
   selection times decreased or remained constant with increased
   illuminance. The most considerable decreases occurred for false positive
   identification times (35.4 +/- 18.8 to 26.2 +/- 14.9 s) and true
   positive identification times (29.7 +/- 18.3 to 24.5 +/- 15.5 s). No
   performance differences were statistically significant. Study findings
   suggest that a controlled increase of ambient lighting within darkly lit
   chest radiology reading rooms, to a level more suitable for performance
   of common radiological tasks, does not appear to have a statistically
   significant effect on nodule detection performance.}},

Abstract = {{The scaling of electrical double layer interaction energy from a
   plate-plate system to a sphere-plate system was reexamined, and it was
   found that accurate scaling without resorting to the Derjaguin
   approximation theoretically predicts the destabilization of
   nanoparticles in water depleted of added electrolyte and,
   consequentially, a maximum stability at a moderate ionic strength. This
   theoretical feature re-emphasizes the dual-role nature of added
   electrolyte that was supported by experimental results of direct surface
   force measurement but not by those of colloidal stability of
   nanoparticle deposition/aggregation. Inconsistences between the
   theoretical prediction and the experimental observation and between
   experimental observations in different systems were discussed. Possible
   reasons leading to the inconsistences were explored, including the
   effect of curvature, the contribution from counterions, the mode of
   interaction, and the applicability of an equilibrium model to describe
   the colloidal interaction of a nanoparticle suspension.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In this study, we explored the use of mechanical high
   intensity focused ultrasound (M-HIFU) as a neo-adjuvant therapy prior to
   surgical resection of the primary tumor. We also investigated the role
   of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in M-HIFU
   elicited anti-tumor immune response using a transplant tumor model of
   prostate cancer.
   Methods: RM-9, a mouse prostate cancer cell line with constitutively
   activated STAT3, was inoculated subcutaneously in C57BL/6J mice. The
   tumor-bearing mice (with a maximum tumor diameter of 5 similar to 6 mm)
   were treated by M-HIFU or sham exposure two days before surgical
   resection of the primary tumor. Following recovery, if no tumor
   recurrence was observed in 30 days, tumor rechallenge was performed. The
   growth of the rechallenged tumor, survival rate and anti-tumor immune
   response of the animal were evaluated.
   Results: No tumor recurrence and distant metastasis were observed in
   both treatment groups employing M-HIFU + surgery and surgery alone.
   However, compared to surgery alone, M-HIFU combined with surgery were
   found to significantly inhibit the growth of rechallenged tumors,
   down-regulate intra-tumoral STAT3 activities, increase cytotoxic T cells
   in spleens and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), and improve the host
   survival. Furthermore, M-HIFU combined with surgery was found to
   significantly decrease the level of immunosuppression with concomitantly
   increased number and activities of dendritic cells, compared to surgery
   alone.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that M-HIFU can inhibit STAT3
   activities, and when combined synergistically with surgery, may provide
   a novel and promising strategy for the treatment of prostate cancers.}},

Title = {{EVAPOTRANSPIRATION: A PROCESS DRIVING MASS TRANSPORT AND ENERGY EXCHANGE
   IN THE SOIL-PLANT-ATMOSPHERE-CLIMATE SYSTEM}},
Journal = {{REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{The role of evapotranspiration (ET) in the global, continental,
   regional, and local water cycles is reviewed. Elevated atmospheric CO2,
   air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (D), turbulent transport,
   radiative transfer, and reduced soil moisture all impact biotic and
   abiotic processes controlling ET that must be extrapolated to large
   scales. Suggesting a blueprint to achieve this link is the main compass
   of this review. Leaf-scale transpiration (f(e)) as governed by the plant
   biochemical demand for CO2 is first considered. When this biochemical
   demand is combined with mass transfer formulations, the problem remains
   mathematically intractable, requiring additional assumptions. A
   mathematical ``closure{''} that assumes stomatal aperture is
   autonomously regulated so as to maximize the leaf carbon gain while
   minimizing water loss is proposed, which leads to analytical expressions
   for leaf-scale transpiration. This formulation predicts well the effects
   of elevated atmospheric CO2 and increases in D on f(e). The case of soil
   moisture stress is then considered using extensive gas exchange
   measurements collected in drought studies. Upscaling the f(e) to the
   canopy is then discussed at multiple time scales. The impact of limited
   soil water availability within the rooting zone on the upscaled ET as
   well as some plant strategies to cope with prolonged soil moisture
   stress are briefly presented. Moving further up in direction and scale,
   the soil-plant system is then embedded within the atmospheric boundary
   layer, where the influence of soil moisture on rainfall is outlined. The
   review concludes by discussing outstanding challenges and how to tackle
   them by means of novel theoretical, numerical, and experimental
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles have great potential in plasmonic photothermal
   therapy (photothermolysis), but their intracellular delivery and
   photothermolysis efficiency have yet to be optimized. We show that
   TAT-peptide-functionalized gold nanostars (NS) enter cells significantly
   more than bare or PEGylated NS. The cellular uptake mechanism involves
   actin-driven lipid raft-mediated macropinocytosis, where particles
   primarily accumulate in macropinosomes but may also leak out: into the
   cytoplasm. After 4-h incubation of TAT-NS on BT549 breast cancer cells,
   photothermolysis was accomplished using 850 nm pulsed laser under 0.2
   W/cm(2) irradiation, below the maximal permissible exposure of skin.
   These results demonstrate the enhanced intracellular delivery and
   efficient photothermolysis of TAT-NS, promising agents in cancer
   therapy.}},

   Analysis of the transient response is typically conducted using

   efficient method for analyzing and displaying pump-probe images, thereby
   alleviating some of the challenges associated with differentiating
   multiple pigments. A theoretical treatment is given to understand how

   softening influences in the electroelastic laminates before applying
   analytical methods. A framework for theoretically predicting empirical

   higher total E, E in the canopy-foliated period was consistently higher,
   which corresponded to the higher soil water content in these years.

Abstract = {{Antibodies to DNA (anti-DNA) are the serological hallmark of systemic
   lupus erythematosus (SLE) and can mediate disease pathogenesis by the
   formation of immune complexes. Since blocking immune complex formation
   can attenuate disease manifestations, the effects of nucleic acid
   binding polymers (NABPs) on anti-DNA binding in vitro were investigated.
   The compounds tested included polyamidoamine dendrimer,
   1,4-diaminobutane core, generation 3.0 (PAMAM-G3), hexadimethrine
   bromide, and a beta-cylodextrin-containing polycation. As shown with
   plasma from patients with SLE, NABPs can inhibit anti-DNA antibody
   binding in ELISA assays. The inhibition was specific since the NABPs did
   not affect binding to tetanus toxoid or the Sm protein, another lupus
   autoantigen. Furthermore, the polymers could displace antibody from
   preformed complexes. Together, these results indicate that NABPs can
   inhibit the formation of immune complexes and may represent a new
   approach to treatment.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand their fate and toxicity in aquatic environments, we
   compared the aggregation and dissolution behavior of gum arabic (GA) and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coated Ag nanoparticles (NPs) in aquatic
   microcosms. There were four microcosm types: surface water; water and
   sediment; water and aquatic plants; or water, sediment, and aquatic
   plants. Dissolution and aggregation behavior of AgNPs were examined
   using ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, and asymmetrical flow field
   flow fractionation coupled to ultraviolet visible spectroscopy, dynamic
   and static laser light scattering, and inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry. Plants released dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the
   water column either through active or passive processes in response to
   Ag exposure. This organic matter fraction readily bound Ag ions. The
   plant-derived DOM had the effect of stabilizing PVP-AgNPs as primary
   particles, but caused GA-AgNPs to be removed from the water column,
   likely by dissolution and binding of released Ag ions on sediment and
   plant surfaces. The destabilization of the GA-AgNPs also corresponded
   with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy results which suggest that
   22-28\% of the particulate Ag was associated with thiols and 5-14\% was
   present as oxides. The results highlight the potential complexities of
   nanomaterial behavior in response to biotic and abiotic modifications in
   ecosystems, and may help to explain differences in toxicity of Ag
   observed in realistic exposure media compared to simplified laboratory
   exposures.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregation of photocatalytic semiconductors was determined to reduce
   the generation of free hydroxyl radicals in aqueous suspensions in a
   fashion dependent on aggregate size and structure. Static light
   scattering measurements were used to follow temporal changes in the
   fractal dimension of aggregating TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles. At length
   scales comparable to nanoparticle size, the structure of aggregated TiO2
   nanoparticles was independent of particle stability and the associated
   aggregation rate, consistent with the fused nature of TiO2 primary
   particles in the initial suspension. In contrast, ZnO aggregates were
   characterized by smaller fractal dimensions when ionic strength, and the
   resulting aggregation rate, were increased. The photocatalytic activity
   of ZnO and TiO2 in generating free hydroxyl radicals varied with
   aggregate structure and size, consistent with theory that predicts
   reduced reactivity as aggregates become larger and more dense.}},

Abstract = {{The production of the neurotoxic methylmercury in the environment is
   partly controlled by the bioavailability of inorganic divalent mercury
   (Hg(II)) to anaerobic bacteria that methylate Hg(II). In sediment
   porewater, Hg(II) associates with sulfides and natural organic matter to
   form chemical species that include organic-coated mercury sulfide
   nanoparticles as reaction intermediates of heterogeneous mineral
   precipitation. Here, we exposed two strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria
   to three forms of inorganic mercury: dissolved Hg and sulfide,
   nanoparticulate HgS, and microparticulate HgS. The bacteria cultures
   exposed to HgS nanoparticles methylated mercury at a rate slower than
   cultures exposed to dissolved forms of mercury. However, net
   methylmercury production in cultures exposed to nanoparticles was 6
   times greater than in cultures treated with microscale particles, even
   when normalized to specific surface area. Furthermore, the methylation
   potential of HgS nanoparticles decreased with storage time of the
   nanoparticles in their original stock solution. In bacteria cultures
   amended with nano-HgS from a 16 h-old nanoparticle stock, 6-10\% of
   total mercury was converted to methylmercury after one day. In contrast,
   2-4\% was methylated in cultures amended with nano-HgS that was aged for
   3 days or 1 week. The methylation of mercury derived from nanoparticles
   (in contrast to the larger particles) would not be predicted by
   equilibrium speciation of mercury in the aqueous phase (<0.2 mu m) and
   was possibly caused by the disordered structure of nanoparticles that
   facilitated release of chemically labile mercury species immediately
   adjacent to cell surfaces. Our results add new dimensions to the
   mechanistic understanding of mercury methylation potential by
   demonstrating that bioavailability is related to the geochemical
   intermediates of rate-limited mercury sulfide precipitation reactions.
   These findings could help explain observations that the ``aging{''} of
   mercury in sediments reduces its methylation potential and provide a
   basis for assessing and remediating methylmercury hotspots in the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of silver nanoparticles in aquatic environments and
   their subsequent impact on organisms depends on key transformation
   processes, which include aggregation, dissolution, and surface
   modifications by metal-complexing ligands. Here, we studied how
   cysteine, an amino acid representative of thiol ligands that bind
   monovalent silver, can alter the surface chemistry, aggregation, and
   dissolution of zero-valent silver nanoparticles. We compared
   nanoparticles synthesized with two coatings, citrate and
   polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP), and prepared nanoparticle suspensions
   (approximately 8 mu M total Ag) containing an excess of cysteine (400 mu
   M). Within 48 h, up to 47\% of the silver had dissolved, as indicated by
   filtration of the samples with a 0.025-mu m filter. Initial dissolution
   rates were calculated from the increase of dissolved silver
   concentration when particles were exposed to cysteine and normalized to
   the available surface area of nanoparticles in solution. In general, the
   rates of dissolution were almost 3 times faster for citrate-coated
   nanoparticles relative to PVP-coated nanoparticles. Rates tended to be
   slower in solutions with higher ionic strength in which the
   nanoparticles were aggregating. Xray absorption spectroscopy analysis of
   the particles suggested that cysteine adsorbed to silver nanoparticles
   surfaces through the formation of Ag(+I)-sulfhydryl bonds. Overall, the
   results of this study highlight the importance of modifications by
   sulfhydryl-containing ligands that can drastically influence the
   long-term reactivity of silver nanoparticles in the aquatic environment
   and their bioavailability to exposed organisms. Our findings demonstrate
   the need to consider multiple interlinked transformation processes when
   assessing the bioavailability, environmental risks, and safety of
   nanoparticles, particularly in the presence of metal-binding ligands.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance histology (MRH) has become a valuable tool in
   evaluating drug-induced toxicity in preclinical models. However, its
   application in renal injury has been limited. This study tested the
   hypothesis that MRH could detect image-based biomarkers of chronic
   disease, inflammation, or age-related degeneration in the kidney, laying
   the foundation for more extensive use in evaluating drug toxicity. We
   examined the entire intact kidney in a spontaneous model of chronic
   progressive nephropathy. Kidneys from male Sprague Dawley rats were
   imaged at 8 weeks (n = 4) and 52 weeks (n =4) on a 9.4 T system
   dedicated to MR microscopy. Several potential contrast mechanisms were
   explored to optimize the scanning protocols. Full coverage of the entire
   kidney was achieved with isotropic spatial resolution at 31 microns
   (voxel volume = 30 pL) using a gradient recalled echo sequence.
   Isotropic spatial resolution of 15 microns (voxel volume < 4 pL) was
   achieved in a biopsy core specimen. Qualitative age-related structural
   changes, such as renal cortical microvasculature, tubular dilation,
   interstitial fibrosis, and glomerular architecture, were apparent. The
   nondestructive 3D images allowed measurement of quantitative differences
   of kidney volume, pelvis volume, main vessel volume, glomerular size, as
   well as thickness of the cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla.}},

Title = {{A biomechanical role for perlecan in the pericellular matrix of
   articular cartilage}},

Abstract = {{Chondrocytes are surrounded by a narrow pericellular matrix (PCM) that
   is biochemically, structurally, and biomechanically distinct from the
   bulk extracellular matrix (ECM) of articular cartilage. While the PCM is
   often defined by the presence of type VI collagen, other macromolecules
   such as perlecan, a heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, are also
   exclusively localized to the PCM in normal cartilage and likely
   contribute to PCM structural integrity and biomechanical properties.
   Though perlecan is essential for normal cartilage development, its exact
   role in the PCM is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine
   the biomechanical role of perlecan in the articular cartilage PCM in
   situ and its potential as a defining factor of the PCM. To this end,
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) stiffness mapping was combined with dual
   immunofluorescence labeling of cryosectioned porcine cartilage samples
   for type VI collagen and perlecan. While there was no difference in
   overall PCM mechanical properties between type VI collagen- and
   perlecan-based definitions of the PCM, within the PCM, interior regions
   containing both type VI collagen and perlecan exhibited lower elastic
   moduli than more peripheral regions rich in type VI collagen alone.
   Enzymatic removal of HS chains from perlecan with heparinase III
   increased PCM elastic moduli both overall and locally in interior
   regions rich in both perlecan and type VI collagen. Heparinase Ill
   digestion had no effect on ECM elastic moduli. Our findings provide new
   evidence for perlecan as a defining factor in both the biochemical and
   biomechanical properties of the PCM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Flow cytometry has become a powerful analytical tool for applications
   ranging from blood diagnostics to high throughput screening of molecular
   assemblies on microsphere arrays. However, instrument size, expense,
   throughput, and consumable use limit its use in resource poor areas of
   the world, as a component in environmental monitoring, and for detection
   of very rare cell populations. For these reasons, new technologies to
   improve the size and cost-to-performance ratio of flow cytometry are
   required. One such technology is the use of acoustic standing waves that
   efficiently concentrate cells and particles to the center of flow
   channels for analysis. The simplest form of this method uses
   one-dimensional acoustic standing waves to focus particles in
   rectangular channels. We have developed one-dimensional acoustic
   focusing flow channels that can be fabricated in simple capillary
   devices or easily microfabricated using photolithography and deep
   reactive ion etching. Image and video analysis demonstrates that these
   channels precisely focus single flowing streams of particles and cells
   for traditional flow cytometry analysis. Additionally, use of standing
   waves with increasing harmonics and in parallel microfabricated channels
   is shown to effectively create many parallel focused streams.
   Furthermore, we present the fabrication of an inexpensive optical
   platform for flow cytometry in rectangular channels and use of the
   system to provide precise analysis. The simplicity and low-cost of the
   acoustic focusing devices developed here promise to be effective for
   flow cytometers that have reduced size, cost, and consumable use.
   Finally, the straightforward path to parallel flow streams using
   one-dimensional multinode acoustic focusing, indicates that simple
   acoustic focusing in rectangular channels may also have a prominent role
   in high-throughput flow cytometry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Spatial Correlation between Hyperpigmentary Changes on Color Fundus

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Macular hyperpigmentation is associated with progression from
   intermediate to advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The
   purpose of this study was to accurately correlate hyperpigmentary
   changes with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT)
   hyperreflective foci in eyes with non-advanced AMD.
   METHODS. A prospective cross-sectional analysis of 314 eyes (314
   subjects) with intermediate AMD was performed in the multicenter
   Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) Ancillary SDOCT Study to
   correlate hyperpigmentary changes on color fundus photographs (CFP) with
   abnormal morphology on SDOCT. Spatial coregistration was performed with
   an automated algorithm in two nonoverlapping subsets of 20 study eyes,
   which permitted double-masked CFP and SDOCT grading by certified
   investigators.
   RESULTS. Macular CFP hyperpigmentation was significantly associated with
   SDOCT intraretinal hyperreflective foci in the 314 study eyes (P <
   0.001). In a substudy of 40 eyes, automated intermodality spatial
   coregistration was successfully achieved in all 136 (100\%) retinal
   regions selected for CFP and SDOCT grading. In one subset of 20 study
   eyes, 28 of 39 (71.8\%) retinal CFP regions with hyperpigmentation were
   correlated with focal hyperreflectivity on SDOCT, versus seven of 39
   (17.9\%) control regions (P < 0.001). In another subset of 20 eyes, 21
   of 29 (72.4\%) SDOCT regions with hyperreflective foci were correlated
   with hyperpigmentary changes on CFP, versus two of 29 (6.9\%) control
   regions (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS. A novel algorithm achieves automated intermodality spatial
   coregistration for masked grading of regions selected on CFP and SDOCT.
   In intermediate AMD, macular hyperpigmentation has high spatial
   correlation to SDOCT hyperreflective foci and often represents the same
   anatomical lesion. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00734487.) (Invest

Abstract = {{We present a quantitative analysis of the image quality obtained using
   filtered back-projection (FBP) with Ram-Lak filtering and maximum
   likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM)-with no postreconstruction
   filtering in either case-in neutron stimulated emission computed
   tomography (NSECT) imaging using Monte Carlo simulations in the context
   of clinically relevant models of liver iron overload. The ratios of
   pixel intensities for several regions of interest and lesion shape
   detection using an active-contours segmentation algorithm are assessed
   for accuracy across different scanning configurations and reconstruction
   algorithms. The modulation transfer functions (MTFs) are also computed
   for the cases under study and are applied to determine a minimum
   detectable lesion spacing as a form of sensitivity analysis. The
   accuracy of NSECT imaging in measuring relative tissue concentration is
   presented for simulated clinical liver cases. When using the 15th
   iteration, ML-EM provides at least 25\% better resolution than FBP and
   proves to be highly robust under low-signal high-noise conditions
   prevalent in NSECT. However, FBP gives more accurate lesion pixel
   intensity ratios and size estimates in some cases; due to advantages
   provided by both reconstruction algorithms, it is worth exploring the
   development of an algorithm that is a hybrid of the two. We also show
   that NSECT imaging can be used to accurately detect 3-cm lesions in
   backgrounds that are a significant fraction (one-quarter) of the
   concentration of the lesion, down to a 4-cm spacing between lesions.}},

Abstract = {{A factor analysis model based on multitask learning (MTL) is developed
   to characterize the FFT-magnitude feature of complex high-resolution
   range profile (HRRP), motivated by the problem of radar automatic target
   recognition (RATR). The MTL mechanism makes it possible to appropriately
   share the information among samples from different target-aspects and
   learn the aspect-dependent parameters collectively, thus offering the
   potential to improve the overall recognition performance with small
   training data size. In addition, since the noise level of a test sample
   is usually different from those of the training samples in the real
   application, another contribution is that the proposed framework can
   update the noise level parameter in the FA model to adaptively match
   that of the received test sample. Efficient inference is performed via
   variational Bayesian (VB) for the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model,
   and encouraging results are reported on the measured HRRP dataset with
   small training data size and under the test condition of low
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).}},

Abstract = {{Control over thrombin activity is much desired to regulate blood
   clotting in surgical and therapeutic situations. Thrombin-binding RNA
   and DNA aptamers have been used to inhibit thrombin activity and thus
   the coagulation cascade. Soluble DNA aptamers, as well as two different
   aptamers tethered by a flexible single-strand linker, have been shown to
   possess anticoagulant activity. Here, we link multiple aptamers at
   programmed positions on DNA nanostructures to optimize spacing and
   orientation of the aptamers and thereby to maximize anticoagulant
   activity in functional assays. By judicious engineering of the DNA
   nanostructures, we have created a novel, functional DNA nanostructure,
   which is a multi-aptamer inhibitor with activity eightfold higher than
   free aptamer. Reversal of the thrombin inhibition was also achieved by
   the use of single-stranded DNA antidotes, thus enabling significant
   control over blood coagulation.}},

Abstract = {{Topological insulators (TI) are becoming one of the most studied classes
   of novel materials because of their great potential for applications
   ranging from spintronics to quantum computers. To fully integrate TI
   materials in electronic devices, high-quality epitaxial
   single-crystalline phases with sufficiently large bulk bandgaps are
   necessary. Current efforts have relied mostly on costly and
   time-consuming trial-and-error procedures. Here we show that by defining
   a reliable and accessible descriptor (chi) over cap TI, which represents
   the topological robustness or feasibility of the candidate, and by
   searching the quantum materials repository aflowlib.org, we have
   automatically discovered 28 TIs (some of them already known) in five
   different symmetry families. These include peculiar ternary halides,
   Cs\{Sn, Pb, Ge\} \{Cl, Br, I\}(3), which could have been hardly
   anticipated without high-throughput means. Our search model, by relying
   on the significance of repositories in materials development, opens new

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve stimulation has a long history in regional anesthesia.
   Despite the advent of ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blockade, nerve
   stimulation remains a popular technique used alone or, now, in
   combination with ultrasound-guided techniques. In light of this evolving
   utility of nerve stimulation, this is an appropriate time to review the
   basic concepts and knowledge base of this historically important tool.
   Electrical nerve stimulation facilitates nerve localization, using
   threshold current as a surrogate for needle-to-nerve distance.
   Preferential activation of motor nerves is possible because motor nerve
   fibers are more readily activated with a shorter duration of current
   compared with sensory nerves. The association between current and
   needle-to-nerve distance predicts that less current is needed to evoke a
   motor response as the needle moves closer to the nerve. Thus, an
   elicited motor response at or below 0.5 mA is considered a common end
   point for successful neural blockade. However, current magnitude is
   neither 100\% sensitive nor specific. Independent of technical ability,
   both the biological environment and the equipment used impact the
   current-distance relationship. Thus, successful electrical nerve
   stimulation is dependent on an anesthesiologist with a solid foundation
   in anatomy and a thorough understanding of electrophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Blast-related traumatic brain injury is the most prevalent injury for
   combat personnel seen in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan,
   yet as a research community, we still do not fully understand the
   detailed etiology and pathology of this injury. Finite element (FE)
   modeling is well suited for studying the mechanical response of the head
   and brain to blast loading. This paper details the development of a FE
   head and brain model for blast simulation by examining both the
   dilatational and deviatoric response of the brain as potential injury
   mechanisms. The levels of blast exposure simulated ranged from 50 to
   1000 kPa peak incident overpressure and 1-8 ms in positive-phase
   duration, and were comparable to real-world blast events. The frontal
   portion of the brain had the highest pressures corresponding to the
   location of initial impact, and peak pressure attenuated by 40-60\% as
   the wave propagated from the frontal to the occipital lobe. Predicted
   brain pressures were primarily dependent on the peak overpressure of the
   impinging blast wave, and the highest predicted brain pressures were
   30\% less than the reflected pressure at the surface of blast impact.
   Predicted shear strain was highest at the interface between the brain
   and the CSF. Strain magnitude was largely dependent on the impulse of
   the blast, and primarily caused by the radial coupling between the brain
   and deforming skull. The largest predicted strains were generally less
   than 10\%, and occurred after the shock wave passed through the head.
   For blasts with high impulses, CSF cavitation had a large role in
   increasing strain levels in the cerebral cortex and periventricular
   tissues by decoupling the brain from the skull. Relating the results of
   this study with recent experimental blast testing suggest that a
   rate-dependent strain-based tissue injury mechanism is the source
   primary blast TBI.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To quantify the effects of acute electrical stimulation frequency and
   amplitude at the dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP), pudendal nerve (PN)
   and S1 sacral nerve (S1) on isovolumetric reflex bladder contractions
   and maximum cystometric capacity in anaesthetized male cats.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   Experiments were conducted in 14 adult male cats anaesthetized with
   alpha-chloralose.
   The effects of stimulation on the pressure - time integral of reflex
   bladder contractions were evaluated using a randomized block design with
   the following factors randomized: stimulation intensity (0.8, 1, or 2 x
   the threshold for evoking a reflex electromyogram response in the
   external anal sphincter {[}T]), frequency (2 Hz, 5 Hz, 7.5 Hz, 10 Hz, 15
   Hz, 20 Hz, or 33 Hz) and location (PN, S1 or DNP).
   The effects of stimulation (with parameters that produced maximum
   inhibition of isovolumetric bladder contractions) on cystometric
   capacity were evaluated using a randomized block design, with the order
   of stimulation location randomized and control trials interleaved with
   stimulation trials.
   RESULTS
   Inhibition of isovolumetric bladder contractions was significantly
   dependent on stimulation location, frequency, amplitude and the
   interactions between any two of these variables.
   Stimulation of the DNP, at 5 Hz, 7.5 Hz or 10 Hz, and at 2T caused
   greater reductions in normalized bladder contraction area than any other
   location, frequency or amplitude tested.
   Stimulation of the PN or S1 at 7.5 Hz or 10 Hz and 2T, or of the DNP at
   5 Hz, 7.5 Hz or 10 Hz and 0.8T, 1T or 2T generated maximum inhibition of
   isovolumetric bladder contractions.
   Cystometric capacity was significantly larger with stimulation (10 Hz,
   1T-2T) than control.
   There was no significant difference in cystometric capacity based upon
   stimulation location.
   CONCLUSIONS
   There was no significant difference in the maximum degree to which the
   respective optimum parameters inhibited bladder contractions or
   increased cystometric capacity by location.
   The range of amplitudes and frequencies that caused maximum inhibition
   was larger for DNP stimulation than for PN or S1 stimulation.
   These findings have implications on the selection of anatomical target
   and device programming for clinical neuromodulation for treatment of the
   symptoms of overactive bladder.}},

Abstract = {{Protein-based biomaterials are an important class of materials for
   applications in biotechnology and medicine. The exquisite control of
   their composition, stereochemistry, and chain length offers unique
   opportunities to engineer biofunctionality, biocompatibility, and
   biodegradability into these materials. Here, we report the synthesis of
   a thermally responsive peptide polymer-based hydrogel composed of a
   recombinant elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) that rapidly forms a
   reversibly cross-linked hydrogel by the formation of intermolecular
   disulfide cross-links. To do so, we designed and synthesized ELPs that
   incorporate periodic cysteine residues (cELPs), and show that cELPs are
   thermally responsive protein polymers that display rapid gelation under
   physiologically relevant, mild oxidative conditions. Gelation of cELPs,
   at concentrations as low as 2.5 wt\%, occurs in similar to 2.5 min upon
   addition a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide (0.3 wt\%). We show
   the utility of these hydrogels for the sustained release of a model
   protein in vitro, and demonstrate the ability of this injectable
   biomaterial to pervade tumors to maximize tumor coverage and retention
   time upon intratumoral injection. cELPs represent a new class of
   injectable reversibly cross-linked hydrogels with properties
   intermediate between ELP coacervates and chemically cross-linked ELP
   hydrogels that will find useful applications in drug delivery and tissue
   engineering. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{66-76}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Combining decomposition data with process-based biogeochemical models is
   essential to quantify the turnover of organic carbon (C) in surface
   litter and soil organic matter (SOM). Long-term decomposition may be
   suitably analyzed by linear models (i.e., all fluxes defined by
   first-order kinetics), which allow the derivation of analytical
   expressions to estimate the loss of C and the overall apparent decay
   rate (k(app)) through time. Here we compare eight linear models (four
   discrete-compartment models with one or two C pools, two models with a
   single time-dependent decay rate, and two models based on a continuous
   distribution of decay rates) and report their analytical solutions for
   two types of decomposition experiments: i) studies that evaluate the
   decomposition of a single input of fresh litter (i.e., a single cohort,
   as in litterbag and C labeling experiments), and ii) studies that
   evaluate the decomposition of soil samples with compounds of different
   ages (i.e., multiple cohorts, as in long-term incubations or isotope
   dilution experiments). We fitted analytical mass loss functions to both
   types of datasets and evaluated the performance of the models. For
   single-cohort data, continuous-decay models provide the best balance
   between accuracy and parsimony (R-2 = 0.99, lowest Akaike and Bayesian
   information criteria), while for multiple-cohort data the two-pool
   models tend to perform better (R-2 = 0.96), perhaps because of the
   strong separation of time scales in the decomposition data considered.
   Differences among some models are marginal, suggesting that
   decomposition data alone do not point to a single `best' model. All
   models resulted in apparent decay rates that decreased markedly through
   time, in contrast with the assumption of constant k adopted in the
   single-pool exponential decay model. We also show how model parameters
   estimated from single cohort samples can be used to model multiple
   cohort decomposition, unifying both types of experimental data in one
   theory. Based on our results, it is possible to distinguish the temporal
   changes in C loss that are attributable to initial chemical composition
   or abiotic factors, from those associated with the presence of multiple
   ages in the substrate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic radiation force (ARF)-based methods have been demonstrated to
   be a viable tool for noninvasively estimating tissue elastic properties,
   and shear wave velocimetry has been used to measure quantitatively the

   certain cardiac diseases, but a clinically viable means of remotely
   generating and tracking transverse wave propagation in myocardium is
   needed. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) catheter-tip transducers are
   demonstrated here as a viable tool for making this measurement. ICE
   probes achieve favorable proximity to the myocardium, enabling the use
   of shear wave velocimetry from within the right ventricle throughout the
   cardiac cycle. This article describes the techniques used to overcome
   the challenges of using a small probe to perform ARF-driven shear-wave
   velocimetry and presents in vivo porcine data showing the effectiveness

Abstract = {{Genetic bioaugmentation is an in situ bioremediation method that
   stimulates horizontal transfer of catabolic plasmids between exogenous
   donor cells and indigenous bacteria to increase the biodegradation
   potential of contaminants. A critical outcome of genetic bioaugmentation
   is the expression of an active catabolic phenotype upon plasmid
   conjugation. Using a pWW0-derivative TOL plasmid, we showed that certain
   genetic characteristics of the recipient bacteria, including genomic
   guanine-cytosine (G + C) content and phylogeny, may limit the expression
   of the transferred catabolic pathway. However, such genetic limitations
   observed in transconjugants could be overcome by the presence of an
   additional carbon source. Glucose and Luria-Bertani broth were shown to
   enhance the toluene degradation rates of transconjugants; these
   enhancement effects were dependent on transconjugant genomic G + C
   contents. Based on these observations, thorough genetic characterization
   of the indigenous microbial community in the contaminated environment of
   interest may provide a predictive tool for assessing the success of
   genetic bioaugmentation.}},

Abstract = {{An inverse Monte Carlo based model has been developed to extract
   intrinsic fluorescence from turbid media. The goal of this work was to
   experimentally validate the model to extract intrinsic fluorescence of
   three biologically meaningful fluorophores related to metabolism from
   turbid media containing absorbers and scatterers. Experimental studies
   were first carried out on tissue-mimicking phantoms that contained
   individual fluorophores and their combinations, across multiple
   absorption, scattering, and fluorophore concentrations. The model was
   then tested in a murine tumor model to determine both the kinetics of
   fluorophore uptake as well as overall tissue fluorophore concentration
   through extraction of the intrinsic fluorescence of an exogenous
   contrast agent that reports on glucose uptake. Results show the model
   can be used to recover the true intrinsic fluorescence spectrum with
   high accuracy (R-2 = 0.988) as well as accurately compute fluorophore
   concentration in both single and multiple fluorophores phantoms when
   appropriate calibration standards are available. In the murine tumor,
   the model-corrected intrinsic fluorescence could be used to
   differentiate drug dose injections between different groups. A strong
   linear correlation was observed between the extracted intrinsic
   fluorescence intensity and injected drug dose, compared with the
   distorted turbid tissue fluorescence. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

   will enhance in MRI. Furthermore, Mn2+ clears slowly from the activated
   regions; therefore, stimulation can be performed outside the magnet
   prior to imaging, enabling greater experimental flexibility. However,
   because Mn2+ does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the
   need to open the BBB has limited the use of AIM MRI, especially in mice.
   One tool for opening the BBB is ultrasound. Though potentially damaging,
   if ultrasound is administered in combination with gas-filled
   microbubbles (i.e., ultrasound contrast agents), the acoustic pressure
   required for BBB opening is considerably lower. This combination of
   ultrasound and microbubbles can be used to reliably open the BBB without
   causing tissue damage (8-11).
   Here, a method is presented for performing AIM MRI by using microbubbles
   and ultrasound to open the BBB. After an intravenous injection of
   perflutren microbubbles, an unfocused pulsed ultrasound beam is applied
   to the shaved mouse head for 3 minutes. For simplicity, we refer to this
   technique of BBB Opening with Microbubbles and UltraSound as BOMUS (12).
   Using BOMUS to open the BBB throughout both cerebral hemispheres,
   manganese is administered to the whole mouse brain. After experimental
   stimulation of the lightly sedated mice, AIM MRI is used to map the
   neuronal response.
   To demonstrate this approach, herein BOMUS and AIM MRI are used to map
   unilateral mechanical stimulation of the vibrissae in lightly sedated
   mice (13). Because BOMUS can open the BBB throughout both hemispheres,
   the unstimulated side of the brain is used to control for nonspecific
   background stimulation. The resultant 3D activation map agrees well with
   published representations of the vibrissae regions of the barrel field
   cortex (14). The ultrasonic opening of the BBB is fast, noninvasive, and
   reversible; and thus this approach is suitable for high-throughput
   and/or longitudinal studies in awake mice.}},

Abstract = {{Transdifferentiation, where differentiated cells are reprogrammed into
   another lineage without going through an intermediate proliferative stem
   cell-like stage, is the next frontier of regenerative medicine. Wernig
   et al. first described the direct conversion of fibroblasts into
   functional induced neuronal cells (iNs). Subsequent reports of
   transdifferentiation into clinically relevant neuronal subtypes have
   further endorsed the prospect of autologous cell therapy for
   neurodegenerative disorders. So far, all published neuronal
   transdifferentiation protocols rely on lentiviruses, which likely
   precludes their clinical translation. Instead, we delivered plasmids
   encoding neuronal transcription factors (Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l) to primary
   mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a bioreducible linear poly(amido
   amine). The low toxicity and high transfection efficiency of this gene
   carrier allowed repeated dosing to sustain high transgene expression
   levels. Serial 0.5 mu g cm(-2) doses of reprogramming factors delivered
   at 48-hour intervals produced up to 7.6\% Tuj1(+) (neuron-specific class
   III beta-tubulin) cells, a subset of which expressed MAP2
   (microtubule-associated protein 2), tau, and synaptophysin. A
   synapsin-red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter helped to identify more
   mature, electrophysiologically active cells, with 24/26 patch-clamped
   RFP+ cells firing action potentials. Some non-virally induced neuronal
   cells (NiNs) were observed firing multiple and spontaneous action
   potentials. This study demonstrates the feasibility of nonviral neuronal
   transdifferentiation, and may be amenable to other transdifferentiation
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging has been shown to be
   capable of imaging local myocardial stiffness changes throughout the
   cardiac cycle. Expanding on these results, the authors present
   experiments using cardiac ARFI imaging to visualize and quantify the
   propagation of mechanical stiffness during ventricular systole. In vivo
   ARFI images of the left ventricular free wall of two exposed canine
   hearts were acquired. Images were formed while the heart was externally
   paced by one of two electrodes positioned on the epicardial surface and
   either side of the imaging plane. Two-line M-mode ARFI images were
   acquired at a sampling frequency of 120 Hz while the heart was paced
   from an external stimulating electrode. Two-dimensional ARFI images were
   also acquired, and an average propagation velocity across the lateral
   field of view was calculated. Directions and speeds of myocardial
   stiffness propagation were measured and compared with the propagations
   derived from the local electrocardiogram (ECG), strain, and tissue
   velocity measurements estimated during systole. In all ARFI images, the
   direction of myocardial stiffness propagation was seen to be away from
   the stimulating electrode and occurred with similar velocity magnitudes
   in either direction. When compared with the local epicardial ECG, the
   mechanical stiffness waves were observed to travel in the same direction
   as the propagating electrical wave and with similar propagation
   velocities. In a comparison between ARFI, strain, and tissue velocity
   imaging, the three methods also yielded similar propagation velocities.}},

Title = {{A Method for Direct Localized Sound Speed Estimates Using Registered

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Accurate sound speed estimates are desirable in a number of fields. In
   an effort to increase the spatial resolution of sound speed estimates, a
   new method is proposed for direct measurement of sound speed between
   arbitrary spatial locations. The method uses the sound speed estimator
   developed by Anderson and Trahey. Their least squares fit of the
   received waveform's curvature provides an estimate of the wave's point
   of origin. The point of origin and the delay profile calculated from the
   fit are used to arrive at a spatially registered virtual detector.
   Between a pair of registered virtual detectors, a spherical wave is
   propagated. By beamforming the data, the time-of-flight between the two
   virtual sources can be calculated. From this information, the local
   sound speed can be estimated. Validation of the estimator is made using
   phantom and simulation data. The set of test phantoms consisted of both
   homogeneous and inhomogeneous media. Several different inhomogeneous
   phantom configurations were used for the physical validation. The
   simulation validation focused on the limits of target depth and
   signal-to-noise ratio on virtual detector registration. The simulations
   also compare the impact of two-and three-layer inhomogeneous media. The
   phantom results varied based on signal-to-noise ratio and geometry. The
   results for all cases were generally less than 1\% mean error and
   standard deviation. The simulation results varied somewhat with depth
   and F/\#, but primarily, they varied with signal-to-noise ratio and
   geometry. With two-layer geometries, the algorithm has a worst-case
   spatial registration bias of 0.02\%. With three-layer geometries, the
   axial registration error gets worse with a bias magnitude up to 2.1\%
   but is otherwise relatively stable over depth. The stability over depth
   of the bias in a given medium still allows for accurate sound speed
   estimates with a mean relative error less than 0.2\%.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives Differential Normalized Fluorescence (DNF)
   technique has been used to distinguish high-grade dysplasia from
   non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus. This technology may assist
   gastroenterologists in targeting biopsies, reducing the number of
   biopsies using the standard protocol. In the presence of reactive
   atypia/inflammation, it becomes difficult for the pathologist to
   differentiate non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus from Barrett's
   esophagus with low-grade dysplasia. Before DNF technique may be used to
   guide target biopsies, it is critical to know whether reactive
   atypia/inflammation in non-dysplastic Barrett's may result in false
   positives. This study was conducted to determine whether DNF technique
   is adversely affected by the presence of reactive atypia/inflammation in
   non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus resulting in false positives. Study
   Design/Materials and Methods Four hundred ten-nanometer laser light was
   used to induce autofluorescence of Barrett's mucosa in 49 patients. The
   clinical study included 37 males and 12 females. This was a blinded
   retrospective data analysis study. A total of 303 spectra were collected
   and matched to non-dysplastic Barrett's biopsy results. One hundred
   seventy-five spectra were collected from areas with a pathology of
   non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus with reactive atypia/inflammation.
   One hundred twenty-eight spectra were collected from areas with
   non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus without reactive
   changes/inflammation. The spectra were analyzed using the DNF Index at
   480?nm and classified as positive or negative using the threshold of
   -0.75?X?10-3. Results Using DNF technique, 92.6\% of non-dysplastic
   samples with reactive atypia/inflammation were classified correctly
   (162/175). 92.2\% of non-dysplastic samples without reactive
   atypia/inflammation were classified correctly (118/128). Comparing the
   ratios of false positives among the two sample groups, there was not a
   statistically significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion
   Using DNF technique for classification of non-dysplastic Barrett's
   mucosa does not result in false-positive readings due to reactive
   atypia/inflammation. Target biopsies guided by DNF technique may
   drastically reduce the number of pinch biopsies using the standard
   biopsy protocol. Lasers Surg. Med. 44: 390396, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Wrinkling of thin stiff films on thick compliant elastomeric substrates
   subject to plane strain compression is considered for cases in which the
   substrate is pre-stretched prior to film attachment. Advanced wrinkling
   modes are investigated that evolve as the systems are compressed beyond
   the onset of the primary sinusoidal wrinkling mode. If the substrate
   pre-stretch is greater than about 40\%, an advanced mode in the form of
   a series of well-spaced ridges separated by relatively flat film is
   observed in the simulations. Our experiments reveal a localization mode
   in the form of alternating packets of large and small amplitude
   wrinkles, but not ridges, while ridge formation has been observed in
   other recent experiments. Measurements of undulation amplitudes have
   been made for wrinkle fields of stiff films formed by oxidation of the
   surface of pre-stretched PDMS substrates. Simulations have been
   performed with a finite element model and an analytical film/substrate
   model. The formation of the ridge mode is a consequence of the altered
   nonlinearity of the substrate produced by the pre-stretch. The role of
   the tangential substrate stiffness in suppressing localization at the
   ridges is also highlighted. If there is no substrate pre-stretch, or if
   the substrate is pre-compressed, the primary sinusoidal mode gives way
   to an entirely different sequence of advanced modes usually entailing
   period doubling followed by folding. The nature of substrate
   nonlinearity that leads to ridges or folds is discussed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Nanotopography changes human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) from their
   shape to their differentiation potential; however little is known about
   the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we study the culture of hMSC
   on polydimethylsiloxane substrates with 350 nm grating topography and
   investigate the focal adhesion composition and dynamics using
   biochemical and imaging techniques. Our results show that zyxin protein
   plays a key role in the hMSC response to nanotopography. Zyxin
   expression is downregulated on 350 nm gratings, leading to smaller and
   more dynamic focal adhesion. Since the association of zyxin with focal
   adhesions is force-dependent, smaller zyxin-positive adhesion as well as
   its higher turnover rate suggests that the traction force in focal
   adhesion on 350 nm topography is decreased. These changes lead to faster
   and more directional migration on 350 nm gratings. These findings
   demonstrate that nanotopography decreases the mechanical forces acting
   on focal adhesions in hMSC and suggest that force-dependent changes in
   zyxin protein expression and kinetics underlie the focal adhesion
   remodeling in response to 350 nm grating topography, resulting in
   modulation of hMSC function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates two parameters that measure the coherence of a
   frame: worst-case and average coherence. We first use worst-case and
   average coherence to derive near-optimal probabilistic guarantees on
   both sparse signal detection and reconstruction in the presence of
   noise. Next, we provide a catalog of nearly tight frames with small
   worst-case and average coherence. Later, we find a new lower bound on
   worst-case coherence; we compare it to the Welch bound and use it to
   interpret recently reported signal reconstruction results. Finally, we
   give an algorithm that transforms frames in a way that decreases average
   coherence without changing the spectral norm or worst-case coherence.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES}},

Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Drought-related tree mortality at a regional scale causes drastic shifts
   in carbon and water cycling in Southeast Asian tropical rain forests,
   where severe droughts are projected to occur more frequently, especially
   under El Nino conditions. We examine how the mortality of a Bornean
   tropical rain forest is altered by projected shifts in rainfall, using
   field measurements, global climate model (GCM) simulation outputs, and
   an index developed for drought-induced tree mortality (Tree Death Index
   h) associated with a stochastic ecohydrological model. All model
   parameters have clear physical meanings and were obtained by field
   observations. Rainfall statistics as primary model forcing terms are
   constructed from long-term rainfall records for the late 20th century,
   and 14 GCM rainfall projections for the late 21st century. These
   statistics indicate that there were sporadic severe droughts
   corresponding with El Nino events, generally occurring in January-March,
   and that seasonality in rainfall will become more pronounced, e. g., dry
   (January-March) seasons becoming drier and wet (October-December)
   seasons becoming wetter. The computed eta well reflects high tree
   mortality under severe drought during the 1997-1998 El Nino event. For
   the present, model results demonstrate high and low probabilities of
   mortality in January-March and October-December, respectively, and they
   predict that the difference in such probabilities will increase in the
   future. Such high probability of mortality in the dry season is still
   significantly high, even considering the beneficial effect of increased
   soil water storage in the wet season (which is projected to increase in
   the late 21st century).}},

Abstract = {{Baleen whales (Mysticeti) communicate using low-frequency acoustic
   signals. These long-wavelength sounds can be detected over hundreds of
   kilometres, potentially allowing contact over large distances.
   Low-frequency noise from large ships (20-200 Hz) overlaps acoustic
   signals used by baleen whales, and increased levels of underwater noise
   have been documented in areas with high shipping traffic. Reported
   responses of whales to increased noise include: habitat displacement,
   behavioural changes and alterations in the intensity, frequency and
   intervals of calls. However, it has been unclear whether exposure to
   noise results in physiological responses that may lead to significant
   consequences for individuals or populations. Here, we show that reduced
   ship traffic in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, following the events of 11
   September 2001, resulted in a 6 dB decrease in underwater noise with a
   significant reduction below 150 Hz. This noise reduction was associated
   with decreased baseline levels of stress-related faecal hormone
   metabolites (glucocorticoids) in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena
   glacialis). This is the first evidence that exposure to low-frequency
   ship noise may be associated with chronic stress in whales, and has
   implications for all baleen whales in heavy ship traffic areas, and for
   recovery of this endangered right whale population.}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has expanded as an effective treatment for
   motor disorders, providing a valuable opportunity for intraoperative
   recording of the spiking activity of subcortical neurons. The properties
   of these neurons and their potential utility in neuroprosthetic
   applications are not completely understood. During DBS surgeries in 25
   human 25 human patients with either essential tremor or Parkinson's
   disease, we acutely recorded the single-unit activity of 274 ventral
   intermediate/ventral oralis posterior motor thalamus (Vim/Vop) neurons
   and 123 subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. These subcortical neuronal
   ensembles (up to 23 neurons sampled simultaneously) were recorded while
   the patients performed a target-tracking motor task using a cursor
   controlled by a haptic glove. We observed that modulations in firing
   rate of a substantial number of neurons in both Vim/Vop and STN
   represented target onset, movement onset/direction, and hand tremor.
   Neurons in both areas exhibited rhythmic oscillations and pairwise
   synchrony. Notably, all tremor-associated neurons exhibited synchrony
   within the ensemble. The data further indicate that oscillatory (likely
   pathological) neurons and behaviorally tuned neurons are not distinct
   but rather form overlapping sets. Whereas previous studies have reported
   a linear relationship between power spectra of neuronal oscillations and
   hand tremor, we report a nonlinear relationship suggestive of complex
   encoding schemes. Even in the presence of this pathological activity,
   linear models were able to extract motor parameters from ensemble
   discharges. Based on these findings, we propose that chronic
   multielectrode recordings from Vim/Vop and STN could prove useful for
   further studying, monitoring, and even treating motor disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation optics (TO) is a powerful tool for the design of
   electromagnetic and optical devices with novel functionality derived
   from the unusual properties of the transformation media. In general, the
   fabrication of TO media is challenging, requiring spatially varying
   material properties with both anisotropic electric and magnetic
   responses. Though metamaterials have been proposed as a path for
   achieving such complex media, the required properties arising from the
   most general transformations remain elusive, and cannot implemented by
   state-of-the-art fabrication techniques. Here, we propose faceted
   approximations of TO media of arbitrary shape in which the volume of the
   TO device is divided into flat metamaterial layers. These layers can be
   readily implemented by standard fabrication and stacking techniques. We

   Lineage}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{The phenotype of somatic cells has recently been found to be reversible.
   Direct reprogramming of one cell type into another has been achieved
   with transduction and over expression of exogenous defined transcription
   factors emphasizing their role in specifying cell fate. To discover
   early and novel endogenous transcription factors that may have a role in
   adult-derived stem cell acquisition of a cardiomyocyte phenotype,
   mesenchymal stem cells from human and mouse bone marrow and rat liver
   were co-cultured with neonatal cardiomyocytes as an in vitro cardiogenic
   microenvironment. Cell-cell communications develop between the two cell
   types as early as 24 hrs in co-culture and are required for elaboration
   of a myocardial phenotype in the stem cells 8-16 days later. These
   intercellular communications are associated with novel Ca2+ oscillations
   in the stem cells that are synchronous with the Ca2+ transients in
   adjacent cardiomyocytes and are detected in the stem cells as early as
   24-48 hrs in co-culture. Early and significant up-regulation of
   Ca2+-dependent effectors, CAMTA1 and RCAN1 ensues before a myocardial
   program is activated. CAMTA1 loss-of-function minimizes the activation
   of the cardiac gene program in the stem cells. While the expression of
   RCAN1 suggests involvement of the well-characterized calcineurin-NFAT
   pathway as a response to a Ca2+ signal, the CAMTA1 up-regulated
   expression as a response to such a signal in the stem cells was unknown.
   Cell-cell communications between the stem cells and adjacent
   cardiomyocytes induce Ca2+ signals that activate a myocardial gene
   program in the stem cells via a novel and early Ca2+-dependent
   intermediate, up-regulation of CAMTA1.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the growth of Si nanowires (NWs) by SiH4/H-2
   plasmas using the non-noble Ga-nanoparticles (NPs) catalysts. A
   comparative investigation of conventional Si-NWs vapour-liquid-solid
   (VLS) growth catalyzed by Au NPs is also reported. We investigate the
   use of a hydrogen plasma and of a SiH4/H-2 plasma for removing Ga oxide
   shell and for enhancing the Si dissolution into the catalyst,
   respectively. By exploiting the Ga NPs surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
   sensitivity to their surface chemistry, the SPR characteristic of Ga NPs
   has been monitored by real time spectroscopic ellipsometry in order to
   control the hydrogen plasma/Ga NPs interaction and the involved
   processes (oxide removal and NPs dissolution by volatile gallium
   hydride). Using in situ laser reflectance interferometry the metal
   catalyzed Si NWs growth process has been investigated to find the effect
   of the plasma activation on the growth kinetics. The role of atomic
   hydrogen in the NWs growth mechanism and, in particular, in the SiH4
   dissolution into the catalysts, is discussed. We show that while Au
   catalysts because of the re-aggregation of NPs yields NWs that do not
   correspond to the original size of the Au NPs catalyst, the NWs grown by
   the Ga catalyst retains the diameter dictated by the size of the Ga NPs.
   Therefore, the advantage of Ga NPs as catalysts for controlling NWs
   diameter is demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inactivation rates of the MS2 bacteriophage and O-1(2) generation rates
   by four different photosensitized aqueous fullerene suspensions were in
   the same order: aqu-nC(60) < C-60(OH)(6) approximate to C-60(OH)(24) <
   C-60(NH2)(6). Alterations to capsid protein secondary structures and
   protein oxidation were inferred by detecting changes in infrared
   vibrational frequencies and carbonyl groups respectively. MS2
   inactivation appears to be the result of loss of capsid structural
   integrity (localized deformation) and the reduced ability to eject
   genomic RNA into its bacterial host. Evidence is also presented for
   possible capsid rupture in MS2 exposed to UV-A illuminated C-60(NH2)(6)
   through TEM imagery and detection of RNA infrared fingerprints in
   ATR-FTIR spectra. Fullerene-virus mixtures were also directly visualized
   in the aqueous phase using a novel enhanced darkfield transmission
   optical microscope fitted with a hyperspectral imaging (HSI)
   spectrometer. Perturbations in intermolecular extended chains, HSI, and
   electrostatic interactions suggest that inactivation is a function of
   the relative proximity between nanoparticles and viruses and O-1(2)
   generation rate. MS2 log survival ratios were linearly related to CT
   (product of O-1(2) concentration C and exposure time T) demonstrating
   the applicability of classical Chick-Watson kinetics for all fullerenes
   employed in this study. Results suggest that antiviral properties of
   fullerenes can be increased by adjusting the type of surface
   functionalization and extent of cage derivatization thereby increasing
   the O-1(2) generation rate and facilitating closer association with

Abstract = {{Purpose: Radiation exposure from computed tomography (CT) to the public
   has increased the concern among radiation protection professionals.
   Being able to accurately assess the radiation dose patients receive
   during CT procedures is a crucial step in the management of CT dose.
   Currently, various computational anthropomorphic phantoms are used to
   assess radiation dose by different research groups. It is desirable to
   better understand how the dose results are affected by different choices
   of phantoms. In this study, the authors assessed the uncertainties in CT
   dose and risk estimation associated with different types of
   computational phantoms for a selected group of representative CT
   protocols.
   Methods: Routinely used CT examinations were categorized into ten body
   and three neurological examination categories. Organ doses, effective
   doses, risk indices, and conversion coefficients to effective dose and
   risk index (k and q factors, respectively) were estimated for these
   examinations for a clinical CT system (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare).
   Four methods were used, each employing a different type of reference
   phantoms. The first and second methods employed a Monte Carlo program
   previously developed and validated in our laboratory. In the first
   method, the reference male and female extended cardiac-torso (XCAT)
   phantoms were used, which were initially created from the Visible Human
   data and later adjusted to match organ masses defined in ICRP
   publication 89. In the second method, the reference male and female
   phantoms described in ICRP publication 110 were used, which were
   initially developed from tomographic data of two patients and later
   modified to match ICRP 89 organ masses. The third method employed a
   commercial dosimetry spreadsheet (ImPACT group, London, England) with
   its own hermaphrodite stylized phantom. In the fourth method, another
   widely used dosimetry spreadsheet (CT-Expo, Medizinische Hochschule,
   Hannover, Germany) was employed together with its associated male and
   female stylized phantoms.
   Results: For fully irradiated organs, average coefficients of variation
   (COV) ranged from 0.07 to 0.22 across the four male phantoms and from
   0.06 to 0.18 across the four female phantoms; for partially irradiated
   organs, average COV ranged from 0.13 to 0.30 across the four male
   phantoms and from 0.15 to 0.30 across the four female phantoms. Doses to
   the testes, breasts, and esophagus showed large variations between
   phantoms. COV for gender-averaged effective dose and k factor ranged
   from 0.03 to 0.23 and from 0.06 to 0.30, respectively. COV for male risk
   index and q factor ranged from 0.06 to 0.30 and from 0.05 to 0.36,
   respectively; COV for female risk index and q factor ranged from 0.06 to
   0.49 and from 0.07 to 0.54, respectively.
   Conclusions: Despite closely matched organ mass, total body weight, and
   height, large differences in organ dose exist due to variation in organ
   location, spatial distribution, and dose approximation method. Dose
   differences for fully irradiated radiosensitive organs were much smaller
   than those for partially irradiated organs. Weighted dosimetry
   quantities including effective dose, male risk indices, k factors, and
   male q factors agreed well across phantoms. The female risk indices and
   q factors varied considerably across phantoms. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{The conserved TPLH tetrapeptide motif of ankyrin repeats (ARs) plays an
   important role in stabilizing AR proteins, and histidine (TPL (H) under
   bar)-to-arginine (TPL (R) under bar) mutations in this motif have been
   associated with a hereditary human anemia, spherocytosis. Here, we used
   a combination of atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force
   spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to examine the
   mechanical effects of His -> Arg substitutions in TPLH motifs in a model
   AR protein, NI6C. Our molecular dynamics results show that the mutant
   protein is less mechanically stable than the WT protein. Our atomic
   force microscopy results indicate that the mechanical energy input
   necessary to fully unfold the mutant protein is only half of that
   necessary to unfold the WT protein (53 versus 106 kcal/mol). In
   addition, the ability of the mutant to generate refolding forces is also
   reduced. Moreover, the mutant protein subjected to cyclic stretch-relax
   measurements displays mechanical fatigue, which is absent in the WT
   protein. Taken together, these results indicate that the His -> Arg
   substitutions in TPLH motifs compromise mechanical properties of ARs and
   suggest that the origin of hereditary spherocytosis may be related to
   mechanical failure of ARs.}},

Abstract = {{Successful amelioration of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure through
   gene therapy approaches will require a transgene effective at
   attenuating myocardial injury, and subsequent remodeling, using an
   efficient and safe delivery vehicle. Our laboratory has established a
   well-curated, high-quality repository of human myocardial tissues that
   we use as a discovery engine to identify putative therapeutic transgene
   targets, as well as to better understand the molecular basis of human
   heart failure. By using this rare resource we were able to examine age-
   and sex-matched left ventricular samples from (1) end-stage failing
   human hearts and (2) nonfailing human hearts and were able to identify
   the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) as a novel target for
   treating cardiac dysfunction. We demonstrate that XIAP is diminished in
   failing human hearts, indicating that this potent inhibitor of apoptosis
   may be central in protecting the human heart from cellular injury
   culminating in heart failure. Efforts to ameliorate heart failure
   through delivery of XIAP compelled the design of a novel
   adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, termed SASTG, that achieves highly
   efficient transduction in mouse heart and in cultured neonatal rat
   cardiomyocytes. Increased XIAP expression achieved with the SASTG vector
   inhibits caspase-3/7 activity in neonatal cardiomyocytes after induction
   of apoptosis through three common cardiac stresses: protein kinase
   C-gamma inhibition, hypoxia, or beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. These
   studies demonstrate the potential benefit of XIAP to correct heart
   failure after highly efficient delivery to the heart with the rationally
   designed SASTG AAV vector.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical charge storage characteristics of vertically aligned

   decreased. The MWCNT films with 230 nm inter-MWCNT spacing exhibited
   specific capacitance of 228 F/g versus 70 F/g for 506 nm spacing, when
   tested in a non-aqueous electrolyte. Further, a trend in specific
   capacitance versus pore size is proposed. Coupled with previously
   reported trends observed in the sub-10 nm pore size regime, this is
   expected to offer better understanding of electrochemical behavior of
   porous carbon materials over a wide range of pore sizes. (C) 2012

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Spreading and collecting flows are united by the flow design known as
   the S-curve: when plotted versus time, the size of the domain that is
   filled or emptied has a history that is shaped as an S. Here, we show
   that the fastest spreading or collecting (i.e., the steepest S curve) is
   discovered by allowing the tree architecture to morph freely, toward
   greater access over time, in accord with the constructal law of design
   in nature. The angles between the lines of the invading flow
   architecture can be selected such that the overall flow proceeds the
   fastest, covering the greatest territory at any moment. The design is a
   sequence of two distinct phenomena: ``invasion{''} by channels and
   branches that grow fast, and ``consolidation{''} by slow diffusion
   perpendicular to the channels. Invasion and consolidation collaborate
   hand-in-glove to facilitate the spreading or collecting over the
   available finite area or volume. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Warmer climates induced by elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) are
   expected to increase damaging bark beetle activity in pine forests, yet
   the effect of eCO(2) on resin production-the tree's primary defense
   against beetle attack-remains largely unknown. Following
   growth-differentiation balance theory, if extra carbohydrates produced
   under eCO(2) are not consumed by respiration or growth, resin production
   could increase. Here, the effect of eCO(2) on resin production of mature
   pines is assessed. As predicted, eCO(2) enhanced resin flow by an
   average of 140\% (P = 0.03) in canopy dominants growing in low-nitrogen
   soils, but did not affect resin flow in faster-growing fertilized canopy
   dominants or in carbohydrate-limited suppressed individuals. Thus, pine
   trees may become increasingly protected from bark beetle attacks in an
   eCO(2) climate, except where they are fertilized or are allowed to

Abstract = {{Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are a class of molecules that enable
   efficient internalization of a wide variety of cargo in diverse cell
   types, making them desirable for delivery of anticancer drugs to solid
   tumors. For CPPs to be useful, it is important to be able to turn their
   function on in response to an external trigger that can be spatially
   localized in vivo. Here we describe an approach to turning on CPP
   function by modulation of the local density of arginine (Arg) residues
   by temperature-triggered micelle assembly of diblock copolymer
   elastin-like polypeptides (ELP(BC)s). A greater than 8-fold increase in
   cellular uptake occurs when Arg residues are presented on the corona of
   ELPBC micelles, as compared to the same ELPBC at a temperature in which
   it is a soluble unimer. This approach is the first to demonstrate
   digital `off-on' control of CPP activity by an extrinsic thermal trigger
   in a clinically relevant temperature range by modulation of the
   interfacial density of Arg residues on the exterior of a nanoparticle.}},

Abstract = {{We report on an implementation of coherence revival-based heterodyne
   swept source optical coherence tomography that is capable of
   simultaneously imaging the anterior and posterior eye. A
   polarization-encoded sample arm was used to efficiently focus orthogonal
   polarizations on the anterior segment and retina. Depth encoding was
   achieved using coherence revival, which allows for multiple depths
   within a sample to be simultaneously imaged and frequency encoded by
   carefully controlling the optical pathlength of each sample path. This
   design is a significant step toward whole-eye optical coherence
   tomography (OCT), which would enable customized ray-traced modeling of
   patient eyes to improve refractive surgical interventions and eliminate
   optical artifacts in retinal OCT diagnostics. We demonstrated the
   feasibility of this system for in vivo imaging by simultaneously
   acquiring images of the anterior segments and retinas in healthy human
   volunteers. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Detailed Spanish records of cinnabar mining and mercury production
   during the colonial period in Huancavelica, Peru were examined to
   estimate historical health risks to the community from exposure to
   elemental mercury (Hg) vapor resulting from cinnabar refining
   operations. Between 1564 and 1810, nearly 17,000 metric tons of Hg were
   released to the atmosphere in Huancavelica from Hg production. AERMOD
   was used with estimated emissions and source characteristics to
   approximate historic atmospheric concentrations of mercury vapor.
   Modeled 1-hour and long-term concentrations were compared with
   present-day inhalation reference values for elemental Hg. Estimated
   1-hour maximum concentrations for the entire community exceeded
   present-day occupational inhalation reference values, while some areas
   closest to the smelters exceeded present-day emergency response
   guideline levels. Estimated long-term maximum concentrations for the
   entire community exceeded the EPA Reference Concentration (RfC) by a
   factor of 30 to 100, with areas closest to the smelters exceeding the
   RfC by a factor of 300 to 1000. Based on the estimated historical
   concentrations of Hg vapor in the community, the study also measured the
   extent of present-day contamination throughout the community through
   soil sampling and analysis. Total Hg in soils sampled from 20 locations
   ranged from 1.75 to 698 mg/kg and three adobe brick samples ranging from
   47.4 to 284 mg/kg, consistent with other sites of mercury mining and
   use. The results of the soil sampling indicate that the present-day
   population of Huancavelica is exposed to levels of mercury from legacy
   contamination which is currently among the highest worldwide,
   consequently placing them at potential risk of adverse health outcomes.

Abstract = {{We describe the use of Bayesian networks as a tool for nanomaterial risk
   forecasting and develop a baseline probabilistic model that incorporates
   nanoparticle specific characteristics and environmental parameters,
   along with elements of exposure potential, hazard, and risk related to
   nanomaterials. The baseline model, FINE (Forecasting the Impacts of
   Nanomaterials in the Environment), was developed using expert
   elicitation techniques. The Bayesian nature of FINE allows for updating
   as new data become available, a critical feature for forecasting risk in
   the context of nanomaterials. The specific case of silver nanoparticles
   (AgNPs) in aquatic environments is presented here (FINEAgNP). The
   results of this study show that Bayesian networks provide a robust
   method for formally incorporating expert judgments into a probabilistic
   measure of exposure and risk to nanoparticles, particularly when other
   knowledge bases may be lacking. The model is easily adapted and updated
   as additional experimental data and other information on nanoparticle
   behavior in the environment become available. The baseline model
   suggests that, within the bounds of uncertainty as currently quantified,
   nanosilver may pose the greatest potential risk as these particles
   accumulate in aquatic sediments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   a new optically based ``keratometric equivalent power{''} formula for
   SDOCT that eliminates previously described discrepancies between corneal
   power form SDOCT and existing clinical modalities. Phantom objects of
   varying radii of curvature and corneas of normal subjects were imaged
   with a clinical SDOCT system. The optically corrected three-dimensional
   surfaces were used to recover radii of curvature and power as
   appropriate. These were then compared to the manufacturer's reference
   values in phantoms and to measurements from topography and Scheimpflug
   photography in subjects. In phantom objects, paired differences between
   SDOCT and reference values for radii of curvature were not statistically
   significant. In subjects, there were no significant paired differences
   between SDOCT and reference values from the other modalities for
   anterior radius and corneal keratometric power. In contrast to other
   studies, we found that dense volumetric scans with available SDOCT can
   be used to recover corneal biometric values-including power-that
   correspond well with existing clinical measurements. (C) 2012 Optical

Abstract = {{A full-vector spectral element method (SEM) is applied to model and
   simulate surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) waveguides.
   Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) polynomials are used to construct
   higher-order basis functions to achieve spectral accuracy. A
   discretization scheme featuring a nonuniform mesh with extra elements
   near the metal-dielectric interface is proposed to capture the waveguide
   configuration and dramatical mode field variations of the SPP waveguide.
   The studies on the accuracy and mode field distribution show that SEM is
   highly efficient and accurate. Using SEM simulation, a slot-based SPP
   waveguide operating at telecom wavelengths is proposed. Numerical
   results show that the proposed structure can simultaneously achieve
   millimeter-scale propagation distance (L-p similar to 2.6 mm) and
   below-diffraction-limited effective mode area (A(eff)/A(0) similar to
   0.3). Parametric plots illustrate a significant improvement when
   compared to conventional SPP waveguides. Investigation of the mode width
   and crosstalk also demonstrates the excellent 3-D integration
   performance of the structure. The proposed slot-based SPP waveguide thus
   can become a potential candidate for highly integrated photonic
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{The clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment
   of movement disorders depends on the identification of appropriate
   stimulation parameters. Since the mechanisms of action of DBS remain
   unclear, programming sessions can be time consuming, costly and result
   in sub-optimal outcomes. Measurement of electrically evoked compound
   action potentials (ECAPs) during DBS, generated by activated neurons in
   the vicinity of the stimulating electrode, could offer insight into the
   type and spatial extent of neural element activation and provide a
   potential feedback signal for the rational selection of stimulation
   parameters and closed-loop DBS. However, recording ECAPs presents a
   significant technical challenge due to the large stimulus artefact,
   which can saturate recording amplifiers and distort short latency ECAP
   signals. We developed DBS-ECAP recording instrumentation combining
   commercial amplifiers and circuit elements in a serial configuration to
   reduce the stimulus artefact and enable high fidelity recording. We used
   an electrical circuit equivalent model of the instrumentation to
   understand better the sources of the stimulus artefact and the
   mechanisms of artefact reduction by the circuit elements. In vitro
   testing validated the capability of the instrumentation to suppress the
   stimulus artefact and increase gain by a factor of 1000 to 5000 compared
   to a conventional biopotential amplifier. The distortion of mock ECAP
   (mECAP) signals was measured across stimulation parameters, and the
   instrumentation enabled high fidelity recording of mECAPs with latencies
   of only 0.5 ms for DBS pulse widths of 50 to 100 mu/phase. Subsequently,
   the instrumentation was used to record in vivo ECAPs, without
   contamination by the stimulus artefact, during thalamic DBS in an
   anesthetized cat. The characteristics of the physiological ECAP were
   dependent on stimulation parameters. The novel instrumentation enables
   high fidelity ECAP recording and advances the potential use of the ECAP
   as a feedback signal for the tuning of DBS parameters.}},

Abstract = {{RNA interference (RNAi) is a fundamental mechanism of gene regulation
   and has been harnessed to produce a new class of drugs for treatment of
   various diseases. A key issue in these applications is how to
   effectively deliver RNAi therapeutics into target cells. This review is
   focused on advances in RNA delivery in vivo. To achieve it, novel
   strategies have been developed to enhance stability of RNA in cells and
   tissues, overcome barriers to transport of RNA or its carriers in the
   body, and reduce immunogenicity and cytotoxicity of treatment.
   Approaches to RNA delivery are divided into three categories in this
   review: biological, chemical, and physical. Advantages and disadvantages
   of each method are discussed. At present, effective delivery of RNAi
   therapeutics in vivo is still a challenge although significant advances
   have been made in this field.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in digital microfluidics have enabled droplet-based
   biochip devices for DNA sequencing, immunoassays, clinical chemistry,
   and protein crystallization. Since cross-contamination between droplets
   of different biomolecules can lead to erroneous outcomes for bioassays,
   the avoidance of cross-contamination during droplet routing is a key
   design challenge for biochips. We propose a droplet-routing method that
   avoids cross-contamination in the optimization of droplet flow paths.
   The proposed approach targets disjoint droplet routes and synchronizes
   wash-droplet routing with functional droplet routing, in order to reduce
   the duration of droplet routing while avoiding the cross-contamination
   between different droplet routes. In order to avoid cross-contamination
   between successive routing steps, an optimization technique is used to
   minimize the number of wash operations that must be used between
   successive routing steps. Two real-life biochemical applications are
   used to evaluate the proposed droplet-routing methods.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of bioassays in pin-constrained digital microfluidic
   biochips may involve pin-actuation conflicts if the
   concurrently-implemented fluidic operations are not carefully

   synchronize the fluidic operations that can be executed in parallel. The
   goal is to implement these fluidic operations without pin-actuation
   conflict, and minimize the duration of implementing the outcome sequence
   after synchronization. We also extend the synchronization method with
   the addition of a small number of control pins, in order to further
   minimize the completion time while avoiding pin-actuation conflicts. The
   effectiveness of the proposed synchronization method is demonstrated for
   a representative 3-plex assay performed on a commercial pin-constrained
   biochip and for multiplexed in-vitro diagnostics performed on an
   experimental pin-constrained biochip.}},

   uncertainties in ocean global circulation model. The computations focus
   on short-time, high-resolution simulations of the Gulf of Mexico, using

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesioning are two surgical techniques
   used in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients
   whose symptoms are not well controlled by drugs, or who experience
   dyskinesias as a side effect of medications. Although these treatments
   have been widely practiced, the mechanisms behind DBS and lesioning are
   still not well understood. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus
   pallidus pars interna (GPi) are two common targets for both DBS and
   lesioning. Previous studies have indicated that DBS not only affects
   local cells within the target, but also passing axons within neighboring
   regions. Using a computational model of the basal ganglia-thalamic
   network, we studied the relative contributions of activation and
   silencing of local cells (LCs) and fibers of passage (FOPs) to changes
   in the accuracy of information transmission through the thalamus
   (thalamic fidelity), which is correlated with the effectiveness of DBS.
   Activation of both LCs and FOPs during STN and GPi-DBS were beneficial
   to the outcome of stimulation. During STN and GPi lesioning, effects of
   silencing LCs and FOPs were different between the two types of
   lesioning. For STN lesioning, silencing GPi FOPs mainly contributed to
   its effectiveness, while silencing only STN LCs did not improve thalamic
   fidelity. In contrast, silencing both GPi LCs and GPe FOPs during GPi
   lesioning contributed to improvements in thalamic fidelity. Thus, two
   distinct mechanisms produced comparable improvements in thalamic
   function: driving the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic
   inhibition and silencing the output of the basal ganglia to produce
   tonic disinhibition. These results show the importance of considering
   effects of activating or silencing fibers passing close to the nucleus
   when deciding upon a target location for DBS or lesioning.}},

Abstract = {{Oral nonviral gene delivery is the most attractive and arguably the most
   challenging route of administration. To identify a suitable carrier, we
   studied the transport of different classes (natural polymer, synthetic
   polymer and synthetic lipid-polymer) of DNA nanoparticles through three
   well-characterized cellular models of intestinal epithelium (Caco2,
   Caco2-HT29MTX and Caco2-Raji). Poly(phosphoramidate-dipropylamine) (PPA)
   and Lipid-Protamine-DNA (LPD) nanoparticles consistently showed the
   highest level of human insulin mRNA expression and luciferase protein
   expression in these models, typically at least three orders of magnitude
   above background. All of the nanoparticles increased tight junction
   permeability, with PPA and PEI having the most dramatic transepithelial
   electrical resistance (TEER) decreases of (35.3 +/- 8.5\%) and (37.5 +/-
   1.5\%) respectively in the first hour. The magnitude of TEER decrease
   correlated with nanoparticle surface charge, implicating electrostatic
   interactions with the tight junction proteins. However, confocal
   microscopy revealed that the nanoparticles were mostly uptaken by the
   enterocytes. Quantitative uptake and transport experiments showed that
   the endocytosed, quantum dot (QD)-labeled PPA-DNA nanoparticles remained
   in the intestinal cells even after 24 h. Negligible amount of quantum
   dot labeled DNA was detected in the basolateral chamber, with the
   exception of the Caco2-Raji co-cultures, which internalized
   nanoparticles 2 to 3 times more readily compared to Caco2 and
   Caco2-HT29MTX cultures. PEGylation decreased the transfection efficacy
   by at least an order of magnitude, lowered the magnitude of TEER
   decrease and halved the uptake of PPA-DNA nanoparticles. A key finding
   was insulin mRNA being detected in the underlying HepG2 cells,
   signifying that some of the plasmid was transported across the
   intestinal epithelial layer while retaining at least partial
   bioactivity. However, the inefficient transport suggests that
   transcytosis alone would not engender a significant therapeutic effect,
   and this transport modality must be augmented by other means in vivo to
   render nonviral oral gene delivery practical. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{Ab initio calculations of binary metallic systems often predict ordered
   compounds in contrast to empirical reports of solid solutions or
   disordered phases. These discrepancies are usually attributed to slow
   kinetics that retains metastable structures at low temperatures. The
   Fe-V system is an example of this phenomenon, in which we predict two
   ordered stable ground states, Fe3V and FeV3, whereas a disordered sigma
   phase is reported. We propose to overcome this difficulty by hydrogen
   absorption, which facilitates metal atom mobility through vacancy
   formation and separation between the two elements due to their opposite
   affinities towards it, thus accelerating transformation kinetics.
   Hydrogen also increases the relative stability of the ordered structures
   compared with that of the sigma phase without affecting the shape of the
   phase diagram. The hydrogen-induced formation of the ordered structures
   is expressed by a reversible decrease of the electrical resistivity with
   increasing hydrogen pressure. Such behavior has not been reported before
   in thin H absorbing films. Formation of the ordered structures is
   further substantiated by the kinetics of the resistivity changes upon
   variation of the hydrogen pressure, where two stages are distinguished:
   a fast initial stage and a much slower subsequent process in which the
   resistivity changes direction, associated with hydrogen dissolution and
   phase transformation, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The partitioning of rainfall into evapotranspiration, runoff, and deep

   simplified stochastic soil moisture models, we develop analytical
   expressions describing the annual partitioning of rainfall into
   evapotranspiration and deep percolation/runoff in seasonally dry,
   surface water dependent landscapes. We discuss the related changes to
   Budyko's curve under different seasonality scenarios, showing that an
   increase in seasonal rainfall and potential evapotranspiration
   variability as well as dry season length can lead to a decrease in the
   annual evapotranspiration ratio. In addition, our model shows that
   although increased soil water storage can compensate for the decrease in
   evapotranspiration due to climate seasonality, this effect is more
   marked in drier climates (higher annual dryness index) compared to
   wetter climates. Finally, the coupling of the soil moisture model to a
   minimalist plant growth model shows that in seasonally dry climates, a
   maximum in biomass is to be expected for a wet season of optimal length,
   for which the limitations imposed by both water availability and growth
   duration are at a minimum.}},

Title = {{Thermodynamics of an idealized hydrologic cycle}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{The diurnal hydrologic cycle, a sequence of evapotranspiration, boundary
   layer growth, moist convection, and precipitation, is described in a
   thermodynamic framework, assuming an atmosphere composed solely of
   water. This idealized cycle is shown to be equivalent to an abbreviated
   version of the classical Rankine cycle where not all the water vapor is
   condensed. Energy and entropy fluxes of the processes involved in the
   cycle are quantified using the reversible approximation as a function of
   the quality of the liquid-vapor mixture (the ratio of the residual
   background vapor and the total mass of water) and the different
   temperatures at which evaporation and condensation take place. The
   proposed framework allows quantitative estimates of the net work (which
   is used by the cycle to drive the atmospheric circulation and dissipated
   by various frictional forces and nonidealities) as well as of the
   thermodynamic efficiency of the cycle. Possible extensions of the
   idealized framework relating to the role of dry air and the inclusion of
   various irreversible processes are also discussed.}},

   characteristics, interaction with the ionosphere, and peak current
   estimates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed wideband electric field waveforms of 265 first and 349
   subsequent return strokes in negative natural lightning. The distances
   ranged from 10 to 330 km. Evolution of first-and subsequent-stroke field
   waveforms as a function of distance is examined. Statistics on the
   following field waveform parameters are given: initial electric field
   peak, opposite-polarity overshoot, ratio of the initial electric field
   peak to the opposite polarity overshoot, zero-to-peak risetime, initial
   half-cycle duration, and opposite polarity overshoot duration. The
   overwhelming majority of both first and subsequent return-stroke field
   waveforms at 50 to 330 km exhibit an opposite polarity overshoot. At
   distances greater than 100 km, electric field waveforms, recorded under
   primarily daytime conditions, tend to be oscillatory. Using finite
   difference time domain modeling, we interpreted the initial positive
   half-cycle and the opposite-polarity overshoot as the ground wave and
   the second positive half-cycle as the one-hop ionospheric reflection.
   The observed difference in arrival times of these two waves for
   subsequent strokes is considerably smaller than for first strokes,
   suggesting that the first-stroke electromagnetic field caused a descent
   of the ionospheric D-layer. We speculate that there may be cumulative
   effect of multiple strokes in lowering the ionospheric reflection
   height. Return-stroke peak currents estimated from the empirical
   formula, I = 1.5-0.037DE (where I is considered negative and in kA, E is
   the electric field peak considered positive and in V/m, and D is
   distance in km), are compared to those reported by the NLDN.}},

Title = {{Theoretical investigation on the interaction between a soft particle and
   a rigid surface}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{297-305}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{An extension of Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory was
   developed to model the potential energy of interaction between a soft
   particle (particle coated with either uncharged polymer or
   polyelectrolyte) and a rigid flat surface prior to the particle-surface
   contact. An uncharged polymer is predicted to reduce the barrier of
   interaction energy curve by shifting the contact frontier away from the
   particle core and as a result increases the affinity between the coated
   particle and the uncoated surface. For particles coated with
   polyelectrolyte, the particle-surface interaction is primarily regulated
   by the thickness and charge density of the polyelectrolyte layer. For
   either type of coating, increasing ionic strength is predicted to reduce
   the barrier of interaction potential and thus increase the affinity
   between the particle and the surface. A more comprehensive model was
   also established for a polyelectrolyte-coated particle of charged core
   surface, in which the importance of segment density of the coating layer
   was demonstrated. Limitations of these models were discussed especially
   for particles of very low segment density to which the post-contact
   interaction would become important. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{425}},

Abstract = {{Differences in priority organic pollutants (POPs), analyzed by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry, and stable isotope ratios (delta C-13,
   delta S-34, and delta N-15; analyzed by isotope ratio-mass
   spectrometry), divide 77 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from
   the Florida Gulf Coast into three distinct groups. POP levels reflect
   human population and historical contamination along the coast. In the
   least disturbed site, concentrations of Sigma POP in male dolphins were
   18,000 ng g(-1) +/- 6000 (95\% confidence interval here and throughout);
   in the intermediate bay, males had Sigma POP concentrations of 19,000 ng
   g(-1) +/- 10,000. St Andrews Bay was home to dolphins with the highest
   Sigma POP concentrations: 44,000 ng g(-1) +/- 10,300. delta S-34 and
   delta N-15, differed significantly between St. George Sound dolphins and
   those frequenting each of the other two bays, but not between St.
   Andrews and St. Joseph Bays. IPOP concentrations were statistically
   higher in dolphins frequenting St. Andrews Bay, but were not
   significantly different between dolphins occupying St. Joseph Bay and
   St. George Sound. Thus, using either POP or isotope values alone, we
   would only be able to identify two dolphin groups, but when POP and
   isotope data are viewed cumulatively, the results clearly define three
   distinct communities occupying this region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly used as bacteriostatic
   agents to prevent microbial growth. AgNPs are manufactured with a
   variety of coatings, and their potential impacts on wastewater treatment
   in general are poorly understood. In the present study, Nitrosomonas
   europaea, a model ammonia oxidizing bacterium, was exposed to AgNPs with
   citrate, gum arabic (GA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). GA and citrate
   AgNPs inhibited nitrification most strongly (67.9 +/- 3.6\% and 91.4 +/-
   0.2\%, respectively at 2 ppm). Our data indicate that Ag+ dissolution
   and colloid stability of AgNPs were the main factors in AgNP toxicity.
   In general, low amounts of dissolved Ag initially caused a
   post-transcriptional interruption of membrane-bound nitrifying enzyme
   function, reducing nitrification by 10\% or more. A further increase in
   dissolved Ag resulted in heavy metal stress response (e.g., merA
   up-regulation) and ultimately led to membrane disruption. The highest
   effect on membrane disruption was observed for citrate AgNPs (64 +/-
   11\% membranes compromised at 2 ppm), which had high colloidal
   stability. This study demonstrates that coating plays a very important
   role in determining Ag dissolution and ultimately toxicity to
   nitrifiers. More research is needed to characterize these parameters in
   complex growth media such as wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{The surface chemistry of nanoparticles, including their hydrophobicity,
   is a key determinant of their fate, transport and toxicity. Engineered
   NPs often have surface coatings that control the surface chemistry of
   NPs and may dominate the effects of the nanoparticle core. Suitable
   characterization methods for surface hydrophobicity at the nano-scale
   are needed. Three types of methods, surface adsorption, affinity
   coefficient and contact angle, were investigated in this study with
   seven carbon and metal based NPs with and without coatings. The
   adsorption of hydrophobic molecules, Rose Bengal dye and naphthalene, on
   NPs was used as one measure of hydrophobicity and was compared with the
   relative affinity of NPs for octanol or water phases, analogous to the
   determination of octanol-water partition coefficients for organic
   molecules. The sessile drop method was adapted for measuring contact
   angle of a thin film of NPs. Results for these three methods were
   qualitatively in agreement. Aqueous-nC(60) and tetrahydrofuran-nC(60)
   were observed to be more hydrophobic than nano-Ag coated with
   polyvinylpyrrolidone or gum arabic, followed by nano-Ag or nano-Au with
   citrate-functionalized surfaces. Fullerol was shown to be the least
   hydrophobic of seven NPs tested. The advantages and limitations of each
   method were also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Urethral flow-responsive afferents in the cat sacral dorsal root ganglia}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{516}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{34-38}},

Abstract = {{Although sensory feedback from the urethra plays an integral role in the
   regulation of lower urinary tract function, little is known about the
   properties of flow-responsive primary afferent neurons. The purpose of
   this study was to characterize the activity of sacral afferents that
   responded to fluid flow through the urethra. Single neuron action
   potentials were recorded extracellularly from the Si and S2 dorsal root
   ganglia in eight cats anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. 21 of 116
   cells responded to urethral flow but not to mechanical palpation of the
   perineum, 22 responded to both urethral flow and palpation, and 27
   responded to palpation only. 34 of the 43 flow-responsive cells
   exhibited a firing response to 10 ml flow boluses that could be fit
   using a power function: FR(t) = a x (t)(b) + c, where FR is firing rate,
   t is time, and a, b and c are constants. In all 34 cells the `b' term
   was negative, indicating that the firing rate slowed over the time
   course of the urethral flow. In 16 of the 24 cells that were recorded
   during at least four different flow rates, a power function provided a
   good fit of the relationship between firing rate and flow rate:
   FR(flow)= k x (flow)(p) + q, where k, p and q are constants. In each of
   these 16 cells the `p' term was positive, indicating that the firing
   rate tended to increase with increases in flow rate. These are the first
   data to characterize the properties of flow-responsive afferents in the
   cat, and reveal properties that parallel those of other afferents. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Morphing-wing research has garnered much attention in the aerospace
   community over the last decade, and the folding wing is a promising
   concept that can improve aircraft performance over multiple types of
   missions. Several high-fidelity analyses of folding-wing aeroelastic
   stability have been published, but most analyses are specific to certain
   wing planforms or a fixed number of wing segments. This paper presents a
   general aeroelastic model that predicts the flutter speed and flutter
   frequency of a folding wing with simplified geometry but with an
   arbitrary number of wing segments. The beam-theory structural model and
   the strip-theory unsteady aerodynamic model are coupled using Lagrange's
   equations. Three experimental models are constructed, and flutter tests
   are performed over a wide range of fold angles. The theoretical
   predictions for flutter speeds are within 10\% of experimentally
   measured values for most configurations. In general, the results show
   that the essential physics of the problem is captured by the present
   first-principles model. Furthermore, data show that increasing the fold
   angle causes up to 30\% increase in flutter speed, which has
   applications in extending the flutter boundaries of morphing aircraft.}},

Abstract = {{The design of heterojunction devices is typically limited by material
   integration constraints and the energy band alignment. Wafer bonding can
   be used to integrate material pairs that cannot be epitaxially grown
   together due to large lattice mismatch. Control of the energy band
   alignment can be provided by formation of interface dipoles through
   control of the surface chemistry. We have developed an ultra-high-vacuum
   system for wafer-fusion-bonding semiconductors with in situ control and
   measurement of surface properties relevant to interface dipoles. A
   wafer-fusion-bonding chamber with annealing capabilities was integrated
   into an ultra-high-vacuum system with a sputtering chamber and an x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy system for preparing and measuring the
   surface chemistry of wafers prior to bonding. The design of the system
   along with initial results for the fusion-bonded InGaAs/Si
   heterojunction is presented. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation of nervous tissue has been extensively used as
   both a tool in experimental neuroscience research and as a method for
   restoring of neural functions in patients suffering from sensory and
   motor disabilities. In the central nervous system, intracortical
   microstimulation (ICMS) has been shown to be an effective method for
   inducing or biasing perception, including visual and tactile sensation.
   ICMS also holds promise for enabling brain-machine-brain interfaces
   (BMBIs) by directly writing information into the brain. Here we detail
   the design of a high-side, digitally current-controlled biphasic,

Abstract = {{Nutrient resorption in plants influences nutrient availability and
   cycling and is a key process in biogeochemical models. Improved
   estimates of resorption parameters are needed for predicting long-term
   primary productivity and for improving such models. Currently, most
   models assume a value of 50\% resorption for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
   (P) and lack resorption data for other nutrients and for specific
   vegetation types. We provide global estimates of resorption efficiencies
   and nutrient concentrations for carbon (C), N, and P and the first
   global-scale estimates for essential nutrients such as potassium (K),
   calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). We also examine leaf mass loss during
   senescence (LML) globally and for different plant types, thus defining a
   mass loss correction factor (MLCF) needed to quantify unbiased
   resorption values. We used a global meta-analysis of 86 studies and;
   similar to 1000 data points across climates for green and senesced
   leaves in six plant types: ferns, forbs, graminoids, conifers, and
   evergreen and deciduous woody angiosperms. In general, N and P
   resorption differed significantly from the commonly used global value of
   50\% (62.1\%, 64.9\%, respectively; P, 0.05). Ca, C, and Mg showed lower
   average resorptions of 10.9\%, 23.2\%, and 28.6\%, respectively, while K
   had the highest resorption, at 70.1\%. We also found that resorption of
   all nutrients except Ca depended on leaf nutrient-status; globally, C,
   N, P, K, and Mg showed a decrease in resorption with increased nutrient
   status. On average, global leaf mass loss was 24.2\%. Overall, our
   resorption data differ substantially from commonly assumed values and
   should help improve ecological theory and biogeochemical and
   land-surface models.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of plasmonic nanoparticles in photoacoustic
   imaging. When acoustic waves are generated by thermoacoustic expansion
   in the fluid medium surrounding a distribution of these particles and
   the acoustic signals are recorded over a planar aperture, a bandlimited
   image of this distribution can be reconstructed. It is shown that the
   accessible portion of the three-dimensional spatial Fourier transform of
   the unknown source distribution is a spherical shell in k-space, with
   the core representing missing low-frequency Fourier components of the
   source density. When the source arises from an isolated distribution of
   nanoparticles, the iterative Gerchberg-Papoulis procedure can be applied
   to recover the low-frequency Fourier components. It is shown that this
   version of the photoacoustic source reconstruction problem is well
   suited for the use of this procedure. In this way, the fidelity of the
   image of the photoacoustic-generated source defined by the particle
   concentration can be enhanced. The procedure is illustrated using
   simulated data derived from a hypothetical source distribution. (C) 2012

Volume = {{130}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate whether the severity of cystoid macular edema
   (CME) in neonates who were 31 to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, as viewed
   by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging,
   predicts the severity of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) or is related
   to systemic health.
   Design: Of 62 prematurely born neonates in a prospective institutional
   review board-approved study, 42 met the following inclusion criteria: at
   least 1 SD-OCT imaging session prior to 37 weeks' postmenstrual age and
   prior to ROP laser treatment, if a laser treatment was performed, and an
   ophthalmic ROP examination at or after 41 weeks' postmenstrual age,
   evidence of complete retinal vascularization in zone III, or
   documentation through telephone report of such information after
   transfer of care. Measures of CME severity, including central foveal
   thickness, retinal layer thicknesses, and foveal-to-parafoveal thickness
   ratio in 1 eye per subject, were compared with ROP outcomes: laser
   treatment, maximum plus disease, and maximum ROP stage. Systemic health
   factors were also correlated.
   Results: Cystoid macular edema was present in 50\% of neonates. Multiple
   elongated cystoid structures within the inner nuclear layer were most
   common. The presence of CME was not associated with ROP outcomes. The
   central foveal thickness, the thickness of the inner retinal layers, and
   the foveal-to-parafoveal thickness ratio were higher in eyes that
   required laser treatment or that developed plus disease or ROP stage 3.
   Cystoid macular edema was not clearly associated with systemic factors.
   Conclusions: Cystoid macular edema is common in premature-infants
   screened for ROP before 37 weeks' postmenstrual age, with the most
   common SD-OCT phenotype of a bulging fovea from multiple elongated
   cystoid spaces. Detection of CME is not associated with ROP severity;
   however, tomographic thickness measurements could potentially predict a
   higher risk of requiring laser treatment or developing plus disease or
   ROP stage 3. Systemic health factors are probably not related to the
   development of CME.}},

Abstract = {{We report herein the unexpected temperature triggered self-assembly of
   proteins fused to thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs)
   into spherical micelles. A set of six ELP block copolymers (ELPBC)
   differing in hydrophilic and hydrophobic block lengths were genetically
   fused to two single domain proteins, thioredoxin (Trx) and a fibronectin
   type III domain (Fn3) that binds the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. The
   self-assembly of these protein-ELPBC fusions as a function of
   temperature was investigated by UV spectroscopy, light scattering, and
   cryo-TEM. Self-assembly of the ELPBC was unexpectedly retained upon
   fusion to the two proteins, resulting in the formation of spherical
   micelles with a hydrodynamic radius that ranged from 24 to 37 nm,
   depending on the protein and ELPBC. Cryo-TEM images confirmed the
   formation of spherical particles with a size that was consistent with
   that measured by light scattering. The bioactivity of Fn3 was retained
   when presented by the ELPBC micelles, as indicated by the enhanced
   uptake of the Fn3-decorated ELPBC micelles in comparison to the unimer
   by cells that overexpress the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. The fusion of
   single domain proteins to ELP(BC)s may provide a ubiquitous platform for
   the multivalent presentation of proteins.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2558-2562}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aiming to resolve the manifold ambiguities for sparse arrays, a method
   based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm using
   planar substrate is proposed. The main reason for spurious MUSIC
   spectrum is that the steering vector of spurious direction of arrival
   (DOA) is a linear combination of the steering vectors of true DOAs. The
   main idea of the proposed method is to add some planar substrates at the
   front-ends of the elements of an array. The refractive indices and
   thicknesses of the substrates can be different from each other. This
   treatment breaks down the linearity which induces the ambiguity of a
   sparse array. Because the equivalent positions of the elements change
   for different DOAs after adding the substrates on the array, the
   spurious peaks will disappear or not overlap on the old peaks.
   Nevertheless the peaks of the true directions will remain. The spurious
   peaks can be discriminated according to this feature. Simulation results
   demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the method.
   Meanwhile the simulation results also show that the proposed method can
   partially resolve the trivial ambiguities even if the true DOA and the
   spurious DOA are confined to {[}0 degrees, 180 degrees).}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive fault-tolerant H-infinity output feedback controller is
   designed for a linear system with actuator faults by incorporating an
   observer for actuator faults. This observer is improved from an unknown
   input observer to make it more appropriate for tracking all fault
   parameters. The sufficient condition of the existence for this observer
   is provided. Then, the adaptive fault-tolerant H-infinity feedback
   controller is proposed by using the estimated fault parameters. This
   controller can ensure the H-infinity performance of system and
   accommodate actuator faults simultaneously, but it requires solving
   nonlinear matrix inequalities. An implementation scheme is designed by
   translating the nonlinear inequalities to solvable linear matrix
   inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of the adaptive H-infinity
   output feedback controller is validated by stabilizing a vertical
   takeoff and landing helicopter when its actuators suffer from faults.}},

Title = {{Phase Separation Behavior of Fusidic Acid and Rifampicin in PLGA
   Microspheres}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1489-1501}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to characterize the phase separation
   behavior of fusidic acid (FA) and rifampicin (RIF) in poly(D,L-lactic
   acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) using a model microsphere formulation. To
   accomplish this, microspheres containing 20\% FA with 0\%, 5\%, 10\%,
   20\%, and 30\% RIF and 20\% RIF with 30\%, 20\% 10\%, 5\%, and 0\% FA
   were prepared by solvent evaporation. Drug-polymer and drug-drug
   compatibility and miscibility were characterized using laser confocal
   microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, XRPD, DSC, and real-time video
   recordings of single-microsphere formation. The encapsulation of FA and
   RIF alone, or in combination, results in a liquid-liquid phase
   separation of solvent-and-drug-rich microdomains that are excluded from
   the polymer bulk during microsphere hardening, resulting in amorphous
   spherical drug-rich domains within the polymer bulk and on the
   microsphere surface. FA and RIF phase separate from PLGA at relative
   droplet volumes of 0.311 +/- 0.014 and 0.194 +/- 0.000, respectively,
   predictive of the incompatibility of each drug and PLGA. When coloaded,
   FA and RIF phase separate in a single event at the relative droplet
   volume 0.251 +/- 0.002, intermediate between each of the monoloaded
   formulations and dependent on the relative contribution of FA or RIF.
   The release of FA and RIP from phase-separated microspheres was
   characterized exclusively by a burst release and was dependent on the
   phase exclusion of surface drug-rich domains. Phase separation results
   in coalescence of drug-rich microdroplets and polymer phase exclusion,
   and it is dependent on the compatibility between FA and RIF and PLGA. FA
   and RIF are mutually miscible in all proportions as an amorphous glass,
   and they phase separate from the polymer as such. These drug-rich
   domains were excluded to the surface of the microspheres, and subsequent
   release of both drugs from the microspheres was rapid and reflected this
   surface location.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we make contact with the field of compressive sensing and

   which, a selected number of B-scans are imaged at higher signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR). We learn a sparse representation dictionary for each of
   these high-SNR images, and utilize such dictionaries to denoise the
   low-SNR B-scans. We name this method multiscale sparsity based
   tomographic denoising (MSBTD). We show the qualitative and quantitative
   superiority of the MSBTD algorithm compared to popular denoising
   algorithms on images from normal and age-related macular degeneration
   eyes of a multi-center clinical trial. We have made the corresponding

Abstract = {{Quantitative phase spectroscopy is presented as a novel method of
   measuring the wavelength-dependent refractive index of microscopic
   volumes. Light from a broadband source is filtered to an similar to 5 nm
   bandwidth and rapidly tuned across the visible spectrum in 1 nm
   increments by an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). Quantitative phase
   images of semitransparent samples are recovered at each wavelength using
   off-axis interferometry and are processed to recover relative and
   absolute dispersion measurements. We demonstrate the utility of this
   approach by (i) spectrally averaging phase images to reduce coherent
   noise, (ii) measuring absorptive and dispersive features in
   microspheres, and (iii) quantifying bulk hemoglobin concentrations by
   absolute refractive index measurements. Considerations of using low
   coherence illumination and the extension of spectral techniques in
   quantitative phase measurements are discussed. (c) 2012 Optical Society

   previously developed for quantifying retinal and corneal layer

   presented technique relies on a transform that maps closed-contour
   features in the Cartesian domain into lines in the quasi-polar domain.
   The features of interest are then segmented as layers via GTDP.
   Application of this method to segment closed-contour features in several
   ophthalmic image types is shown. Quantitative validation experiments for
   retinal pigmented epithelium cell segmentation in confocal fluorescence
   microscopy images attests to the accuracy of the presented technique.

   relationship between Weber number and drop diameter ratios on the
   dynamical simulation of raindrop size distributions. Results of the

   classical parameterizations. Comparison with previous results indicates
   on average an increase of 70\% in the drop number concentration and a
   15\% decrease in rain intensity for the equilibrium drop size
   distribution (DSD). Furthermore, the drop bounce process is
   parameterized as a function of drop size based on laboratory experiments
   for the first time in a microphysical model. Numerical results indicate
   that drop bounce has a strong influence on the equilibrium DSD, in
   particular for very small drops (<0.5 mm), leading to an increase of up
   to 150\% in the small drop number concentration (left-hand side of the

Abstract = {{As a prelude to the understanding of mechanotransduction in human
   embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation, the mechanical behavior of
   hESCs in the form of cell pellet is studied. The pellets were tested
   after 3 or 5 weeks of cell culture in order to demonstrate the effect of
   the duration of cell culture on the mechanical properties of the
   pellets. A micromechanical tester was used to conduct unconfined
   compression on hESC pellet, and experimental, numerical, and analytical
   methods were combined to determine the mechanical properties of hESC
   pellet. It is assumed that the mechanical behavior of hESC pellets can
   be described by an isotropic, linear viscoelastic model consisting of a
   spring and two Maxwell units in parallel, and the Poisson's ratio of the
   hESC pellet is constant based on pellet deformation in the direction
   perpendicular to the compression direction. Finite element method (FEM)
   simulation was adopted to determine the values of Poisson's ratio and
   the five parameters contained in the viscoelastic model. The variations
   of Poisson's ratio and the initial elastic modulus are found to be
   larger compared with those of the four other parameters. Results show
   that longer duration of cell culture leads to higher modulus of hESC
   pellet. The effect of pellet size error on the values of mechanical
   parameters determined is studied using FEM simulation, and it is found
   that the effect of size error on Poisson's ratio and initial elastic
   modulus is much larger than that on the other parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Radiation exposure during medical procedures
   continues to be an increasing concern for physicians and patients. We
   determined organ-specific dose rates and calculated effective dose rates
   during right and left percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) using a
   validated phantom model.
   Materials and Methods: A validated anthropomorphic adult male phantom
   was placed prone on an operating room table. Metal oxide semiconductor
   field effect transistor dosimeters were placed at 20 organ locations in
   the model and were used to measure the organ dosages. A portable C-arm
   was used to provide continuous fluoroscopy for three 10 minute runs each
   to simulate a left and right PCNL. Organ dose rate (mGy/s) was
   determined by dividing organ dose by fluoroscopy time. The organ dose
   rates were multiplied by their tissue weighting factor and summed to
   determine effective dose rate (EDR) (mSv/s). Two-dimensional radiation
   distribution in the abdomen during a left-sided PCNL was visually
   determined using radiochromic film.
   Results: The EDR for a left PCNL was 0.021 mSv/s +/- 0.0008. The EDR for
   a right PCNL was 0.014 mSv/s +/- 0.0004. The skin entrance was exposed
   to the greatest amount of radiation during left and right PCNL, 0.24
   mGy/s and 0.26 mGy/s, respectively. Radiochromic film demonstrates
   visually the nonuniform dose distribution as the x-ray beam enters
   through the skin from the radiation source.
   Conclusions: The effective dose rate is higher for a left-sided PCNL
   compared with a right-sided PCNL. The distribution of radiation exposure
   during PCNL is not uniform. Further studies are needed to determine the
   long-term implications of these radiation doses during percutaneous
   stone removal.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to develop a framework for monitoring snow
   water equivalent (SWE) and snowpack radiometric properties (e. g.,
   surface emissivity and reflectivity) and microwave emissions in remote
   regions where ancillary data and ground-based observations for model
   calibration and/or data assimilation are lacking. For this purpose, an
   existing land surface hydrology model (LSHM) with single-layer (SL) snow
   physics was coupled to a microwave emission model (MEMLS). The coupled
   model (MLSHM-SL) predicts microwave emissions at various frequencies and
   polarizations as well as snowpack radiometric properties (e. g.,
   emissivity) based on snowpack density, temperature, snow depth, and
   volumetric liquid water content simulated by the hydrology model with
   atmospheric forcing obtained from either observations, or the analysis
   of weather forecasts. The MLSHM-SL was evaluated in prognostic observing
   system simulation (OSS) mode for two case-studies: 1) a multi-year
   simulation of snowpack radio-brightness behavior at Valdai, Russia
   compared against Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR)
   observations at three frequencies (18, 21, and 37 GHz, V, and H
   polarizations) over six years, 1978-1983; and 2) an inter-comparison of
   simulated and observed brightness temperatures for the Special Sensor
   Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) during the 2002-2003 snow season as part of the
   Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) in Colorado. In the case of
   Valdai, the model captures well the mass balance as well as radiometric
   behavior of the snowpack during both accumulation and melt, with
   significantly best skill for vertical polarization (10-16 K differences
   in error statistics as compared to horizontal polarization),
   particularly in the winter season January-March (dry snow conditions).
   Larger biases were detected for intermittent snowpack conditions at the
   beginning of the fall season due to uncertainty in fractional snow cover
   and snow wetness at the spatial scale of the SMMR. Similar results were
   obtained for the OSS of SSM/I and AMSR-E for CLPX, though differences
   between vertical and horizontal polarization error statistics are more
   modest (similar to 2-4 K). Error statistics are lower for AMSR-E V-pol
   at 19 and 37 GHz. MLSHM-SL predicted snowpack physical properties (bulk
   snow density and SWE) compare well against CLPX snowpit observations
   during the accumulation season with residuals smaller than 10\% of
   observed values. Moreover, the MLSHM-SL simulations in full prognostic
   mode, and without calibration from the beginning through the end of the
   snow season, are as skillful as MEMLS with specified physical attributes
   from snow pit observations. This indicates that the MSLSHM-SL can be
   used independently as a physically based estimator of SWE in remote
   regions, and in a data-assimilation framework to provide a physical
   basis to the interpretation of satellite-based observations of snow.}},

Abstract = {{A multilayer formulation of snow hydrological processes implemented in
   an existing snow hydrology-emission model (MLSHM-ML) was applied in
   observing system simulation mode (OSS) to two very different climatic
   and physiographic regions (Valdai, Russia and Colorado, USA) for both
   wet and dry snow regimes, and over multiple years. The results were
   evaluated against ground-based observations of snowpack physical
   properties and microwave radiometric observations from the Scanning
   Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor
   Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS
   (AMSR-E) observations at 18-19-, 22-23-, and 36-37-GHz vertical and
   horizontal polarizations (V-pol and H-pol, respectively). Whereas snow
   water equivalent (SWE) results are similar to the results obtained with
   single-layer physics when the snow is dry, the multilayer physics have a
   better skill at capturing the overall temporal evolution of bulk
   density, snow temperature, and snow depth during the accumulation
   season, and at the onset and throughout the melting season. However,
   snow density profiles overestimate density at the bottom of the
   snowpack, consistent with the lack of an explicit representation of
   depth hoar in the rearrangement of mass and grain size distribution in
   the snowpack. Regarding the radiometric behavior, the multilayer SMMR
   OSS for Valdai shows improved results for nighttime simulations
   (descending SMMR paths, 11 P. M. LST) and H-pol (similar to 3-5 K
   decrease in error statistics), particularly at 37 GHz. For daytime
   simulations (ascending SMMR paths, 11 A. M. LST), there are modest
   improvements at 18 (similar to 1 K) and 37 GHz (similar to 2-3 K) for
   H-pol, and generally loss of skill for V-pol at all frequencies.
   Systematic improvements at nighttime but not during daytime suggest that
   surface heterogeneities, including subgrid scale variability of
   transient melting, play an important role on surface emissivity. This is
   the case for cold land process experiment in Colorado, where spatial
   variability in fractional forest cover, geology, and complex topography
   explains the modest differences between the single and multilayer SSM/I
   OSS for H-pol, whereas significant gains (similar to 4-8 K decrease in
   error statistics) were attained for V-pol at 37 GHz only. For AMSR-E,
   the multilayer OSS looses skill for H-pol, and only bias and mean
   absolute error improve for V-pol at all frequencies. These somewhat
   mixed results suggest that representation of snow stratigraphy alone is
   not sufficient to improve the OSS ability to describe the nonlinear
   interactions among hydrologic and electromagnetic processes. Chief among
   these are the temporal evolution of snow correlation length with depth
   and the representation of subgrid scale variability constrained by the
   spatial resolution and inherent uncertainty of the meteorological
   forcing. Nevertheless, the multilayer OSS improved performance at 37 GHz
   is an important finding toward reducing ambiguity in the sensitivity of
   37-GHz H-pol brightness temperature to SWE in retrieval models.}},

Abstract = {{3D solid and pocketed micro-wires and micro-walls are needed for
   emerging applications that require fine-scale functional structures in
   three dimensions, including micro-heaters, micro-reactors and solar
   cells. To fulfill this demand, 3D micro-structures with high aspect
   ratios (>50:1) are developed on a low-cost basis that is applicable for
   mass production with high throughput, also enabling the printing of
   structures that cannot be manufactured by conventional techniques.
   Additively patterned 3D gold micro-walls and -wires are grown by
   piezoelectric inkjet printing of nanofluids, selectively combined with
   in situ simultaneous laser annealing that can be applied to large-scale
   bulk production. It is demonstrated how the results of 3D printing
   depend on the piezoelectric voltage pulse, the substrate heating
   temperature and the structure height, resulting in the identification of
   thermal regions of optimal printing for best printing results.
   Furthermore a parametric analysis of the applied substrate temperature
   during printing leads to proposed temperature ranges for solid and

   estimation: Comparison of BEST and Wu methods}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of soil hydraulic properties is important for modeling
   hydrological processes and related contaminant transport. This study
   compared four methods in analyzing single-ring infiltrometer data to
   estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and the water
   retention parameter (alpha). These were: (1) original BEST (Beerkan
   Estimates of Soil Transfer Parameters through Infiltration Experiments,
   Lassabatere et al., 2006) method, defined as BEST\_slope; (2) a modified
   BEST method, defined as BEST\_intercept (Yilmaz et al., 2010); (3) Wu1
   (Wu et al., 1999) which attempts the best fit of a generalized solution
   to the infiltration curve using the whole infiltration curve; and (4)
   Wu2 (Wu et al., 1999) which is suitable for the steady state flow case.
   The first three methods are suitable for the transient flow state. The
   infiltration data of 54 different cases within four soil texture classes
   (sand, sandy loam, medium loam, and clay loam) were used. The results
   suggest that the modified version (BEST\_intercept) has a better
   performance (more reasonable estimates) than the original (BEST\_slope).
   Both the BEST\_slope and BEST\_intercept methods perform poorly for the
   sandy soils. The Wu1 method performs better in fitting the experimental
   infiltration curve, and produces more cases with reasonable values
   (normally positive values) of K-s and alpha than both the BEST\_slope
   and BEST\_intercept. In order to apply these existing methods to wider
   conditions (e.g., sandy soils, wet soils, basic oxygen furnace slag),
   the inversion estimation algorithms and the experimental operations in
   the field require further improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Simultaneous mapping of transmembrane voltage (V (m)) and intracellular
   Ca2+ concentration (Ca-i) has been used for studies of normal and
   abnormal impulse propagation in cardiac tissues. Existing dual mapping
   systems typically utilize one excitation and two emission bandwidths,
   requiring two photodetectors with precise pixel registration. In this
   study we describe a novel, single-detector mapping system that utilizes
   two excitation and one emission band for the simultaneous recording of
   action potentials and calcium transients in monolayers of neonatal rat
   cardiomyocytes. Cells stained with the Ca2+-sensitive dye X-Rhod-1 and
   the voltage-sensitive dye Di-4-ANEPPS were illuminated by a
   programmable, multicolor LED matrix. Blue and green LED pulses were
   flashed 180A degrees out of phase at a rate of 488.3 Hz using a
   custom-built dual bandpass excitation filter that transmitted blue (482
   +/- A 6 nm) and green (577 +/- A 31 nm) light. A long-pass emission
   filter (> 605 nm) and a 504-channel photodiode array were used to record
   combined signals from cardiomyocytes. Green excitation yielded Ca-i
   transients without significant crosstalk from V (m). Crosstalk present
   in V (m) signals obtained with blue excitation was removed by
   subtracting an appropriately scaled version of the Ca-i transient. This
   method was applied to study delay between onsets of action potentials
   and Ca-i transients in anisotropic cardiac monolayers.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the use of a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) as a
   tertiary treatment step for ammonia removal in high temperature (35-45
   degrees C) effluents, and quantifies different phenotypes of ammonia and

   temperatures. Bench scale reactors operating at 35 and 40 degrees C were
   able to successfully remove greater than 90\% of the influent ammonia
   (up to 19 mg L-1 NH3-N) in both the synthetic and industrial wastewater.
   No biotreatment was observed at 45 degrees C, although effective
   nitrification was rapidly recovered when the temperature was lowered to
   30 degrees C. Using qPCR, Nitrosomonas oligotropha was found to be the
   dominant ammonia oxidizing bacterium in the biofilm for the first phases
   of reactor operation. In the later phases, Nitrosomonas nitrosa was
   observed and its increased presence may have been responsible for
   improved ammonia treatment efficiency. Accumulation of nitrite in some

Abstract = {{Critical body residues (CBRs) are the measured tissue toxicant

   FS toxic effects were delayed naupliar development (at =0.10 mu gL-1),
   delayed copepodite development (at 0.85 mu gL-1), decreased reproductive
   success (at = 0.39 mu gL-1), and decreased offspring production (at 0.85

Abstract = {{Tenofovir (TFV) is a proven microbicide when administered topically as a
   vaginal gel. To improve its efficacy, TFV was combined with the
   nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor UC781 in a vaginal gel.
   Mixture design of experiments theory was used to define a range of gel
   compositions with varying rheological properties and to assess in vitro
   drug release and tissue retention. Experiments and computations led to
   the specification of three different gels referred to as a spreading gel
   (SG), an intermediate spreading gel (ISG), and a bolus gel (BG). These
   three gels, all containing 1.0\% TFV and 0.1\% micronized UC781, were
   evaluated for in vitro release, in vitro tissue retention and safety,
   and in vivo pharmacokinetics in the rabbit. There were some differences
   in in vitro release rates of UC781 (the higher the gel viscosity, the
   slower the release rate) across gels, while release of TFV was
   independent of gel type. In an organotypic human vaginal-ectocervical
   (VEC) tissue model, the amounts of tissue-associated TFV and UC781 were
   several orders of magnitude higher than their in vitro half-maximal
   inhibitory concentration. There were no differences in VEC tissue
   concentrations of TFV or UC781 between the SG, ISG, and BG. All three
   gels were well tolerated in the VEC model as assessed by tissue
   viability, electrical resistance, histology, and cytokine (interleukin-8
   and interleukin-1 beta) release. The local vaginal tissue concentrations
   in rabbits following a single dose or seven once-daily doses were
   variable and generally lower than those found in the VEC tissue model.
   The approach described herein provides a rational schema to design and
   evaluate vaginal gels for use as microbicides. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{As a result of advances in nanotechnology and the burgeoning
   capabilities for fabricating materials with controlled nanoscale

   introduction of artificially structured metamaterials in place of
   conventional materials for improving optical components as well as
   realizing new optical functionality. Here we demonstrate multilayer,
   lithographically patterned, subwavelength, metal elements, whose
   distribution forms a computer-generated phase hologram in the infrared
   region (10.6 mu m). Metal inclusions exhibit extremely large scattering
   and can be implemented in metamaterials that exhibit a wide range of
   effective medium response, including anomalously large or negative
   refractive index; optical magnetism; and controlled anisotropy. This
   large palette of metamaterial responses can be leveraged to achieve
   greater control over the propagation of light, leading to more compact,

Abstract = {{The field of skeletal muscle tissue engineering is currently hampered by
   the lack of methods to form large muscle constructs composed of dense,
   aligned, and mature myofibers and limited understanding of
   structure-function relationships in developing muscle tissues. In our
   previous studies, engineered muscle sheets with elliptical pores
   ({''}muscle networks'') were fabricated by casting cells and fibrin gel
   inside elastomeric tissue molds with staggered hexagonal posts. In these
   networks, alignment of cells around the elliptical pores followed the
   local distribution of tissue strains that were generated by
   cell-mediated compaction of fibrin gel against the hexagonal posts. The
   goal of this study was to assess how systematic variations in pore
   elongation affect the morphology and contractile function of muscle
   networks. We found that in muscle networks with more elongated pores the
   force production of individual myofibers was not altered, but the
   myofiber alignment and efficiency of myofiber formation were
   significantly increased yielding an increase in the total contractile
   force despite a decrease in the total tissue volume. Beyond a certain
   pore length, increase in generated contractile force was mainly
   contributed by more efficient myofiber formation rather than enhanced
   myofiber alignment. Collectively, these studies show that changes in
   local tissue geometry can exert both direct structural and indirect
   myogenic effects on the functional output of engineered muscle.
   Different hydrogel formulations and pore geometries will be explored in
   the future to further augment contractile function of engineered muscle
   networks and promote their use for basic structure-function studies in
   vitro and, eventually, for efficient muscle repair in vivo.}},

Title = {{A branch scale analytical model for predicting the vegetation collection
   efficiency of ultrafine particles}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{293-302}},

Abstract = {{The removal of ultrafine particles (UFP) by vegetation is now receiving
   significant attention given their role in cloud physics, human health
   and respiratory related diseases. Vegetation is known to be a sink for
   UFP, prompting interest in their collection efficiency. A number of
   models have tackled the UFP collection efficiency of an isolated leaf or
   a flat surface; however, up-scaling these theories to the ecosystem
   level has resisted complete theoretical treatment. To progress on a
   narrower scope of this problem, simultaneous experimental and
   theoretical investigations are carried out at the ``intermediate{''}
   branch scale. Such a scale retains the large number of leaves and their
   interaction with the flow without the heterogeneities and added
   geometric complexities encountered within ecosystems. The experiments
   focused on the collection efficiencies of UFP in the size range 12.6-102
   nm for pine and juniper branches in a wind tunnel facility. Scanning
   mobility particle sizers were used to measure the concentration of each
   diameter class of UFP upstream and downstream of the vegetation branches
   thereby allowing the determination of the UFP vegetation collection
   efficiencies. The UFP vegetation collection efficiency was measured at
   different wind speeds (0.3-1.5 m s(-1)), packing density (i.e. volume
   fraction of leaf or needle fibers; 0.017 and 0.040 for pine and 0.037,
   0.055 for juniper), and branch orientations. These measurements were
   then used to investigate the performance of a proposed analytical model
   that predicts the branch-scale collection efficiency using conventional
   canopy properties such as the drag coefficient and leaf area density.
   Despite the numerous simplifications employed, the proposed analytical

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) tumor models have been established in various
   microfluidic systems for drug delivery and resistance studies in vitro.
   However, one of the main drawbacks of these models is non-uniform
   distribution of cells, leaving regions with very low cell density within
   the 3D structures. As a result, molecular diffusion in the cell
   compartments is faster than that observed in solid tumors. To solve this
   problem, we developed a new technique for preparation of 3D tumor models
   in vitro. It was based on a microfluidic device containing three
   parallel channels separated by narrowly spaced posts. Tumor cells were
   loaded into the central channel at high density. To test the system,
   B16.F10 melanoma cells were perfusion-cultured overnight and the
   resulting 3D structure was characterized in terms of viability, density,
   and morphology of cells as well as transport properties of small
   fluorescent molecules. Immediately upon loading of tumor cells, the cell
   density was comparable to those observed in B16.F10 tumor tissues in
   vivo; and the viability of tumor cells was maintained through the
   overnight culture. The tumor model displayed low extracellular space and
   high resistance to diffusion of small molecules. For membrane-permeant
   molecules (e.g., Hoechst 33342), the rate of interstitial penetration
   was extremely slow, compared to membrane-impermeant molecules (e.g.,
   sodium fluorescein). This versatile tumor model could be applied to in
   vitro studies of transport and cellular uptake of drugs and genes.

Abstract = {{Objective: The effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on
   both the frequency and the temporal pattern of stimulation. We
   quantified responses to cycling DBS with constant frequency to determine
   if there was a critical on and/or off time for alleviating tremor.
   Methods: We measured postural tremor in 10 subjects with thalamic DBS
   and quantified neuronal entropy in a network model of Vim thalamic DBS.
   We tested 12 combinations of cycling on/off times that maintained the
   same average frequency of 125 Hz, four constant frequency settings, and
   baseline.
   Results: Tremor and neural firing pattern entropy decreased as the
   percent on time increased from 50\% to 100\%. Cycling with stimulation
   on for at least 60\% of the time was as effective as regular
   stimulation. All cycling settings reduced the firing pattern entropy of
   model neurons from the no stimulation condition by regularizing
   pathological firing patterns, either through synaptically-mediated
   inhibition or axon excitation.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that pauses present in cycling
   stimulation decreased its effectiveness in suppressing tremor, and that
   changes in the amount of tremor suppression were strongly correlated
   with changes in the firing pattern entropy of model neurons.
   Significance: Cycling stimulation may reduce power consumption during
   clinical DBS, and thereby increase the battery life of the implanted
   pulse generator. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{WiFi continues to be a prime source of energy consumption in mobile
   devices. This paper observes that, despite a rich body of research in
   WiFi energy management, there is room for improvement. Our key finding
   is that WiFi energy optimizations have conventionally been designed with
   a single AP in mind. However, network contention among different APs can
   dramatically increase a client's energy consumption. Each client may
   have to keep awake for long durations before its own AP gets a chance to
   send it packets to it. As AP density increases, the waiting time
   inflates, resulting in a proportional decrease in battery life. We
   design SleepWell, a system that achieves energy efficiency by evading
   network contention. The APs regulate the sleeping window of their
   clients in a way that different APs are active/inactive during
   nonoverlapping time windows. The solution is analogous to the common
   wisdom of going late to office and coming back late, thereby avoiding
   the rush hours. We implement SleepWell on a testbed of eight Laptops and
   nine Android phones, and evaluate it over a wide variety of scenarios
   and traffic patterns. Results show a median gain of up to 2x when WiFi
   links are strong; when links are weak and the network density is high,
   the gains can be even more.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{4, 1}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Through a combination of theory, numerical simulation, and experiment,
   we investigate the motion of magnetic beads on the surface of a magnetic
   ratchet driven by multifrequency fields. Here, we focus on the influence
   of static forcing terms, which were not included in previous models, and
   we derive analytical models that show why the static forcing terms are
   responsible for inducing beads of two different sizes to move in
   opposite directions on the same ratchet potential. We begin our analysis
   with the simplest possible forcing model, and we show that the main
   effect of the static forcing terms is to delay the phase of flux
   reversal. From there, we move onto the full analysis and theoretically
   derive the phase range for which opposite motion among two different
   bead types is achieved. Based on these theoretical results, we conduct
   experimental investigations that explore the effects of bead size and
   static forcing coefficient on the direction of bead motion, which
   confirm most of the expected trends. These results shed light both on
   past experimental work both by ourselves and others, as well as
   elucidate the more general multiplexing capabilities of ratchets.}},

Abstract = {{An optimisation method for antenna element positions in conformal arrays
   is proposed in this study. Owing to the platform effect, the element
   pattern in a conformal array varies with its location. It is usually
   very time consuming to simulate the element patterns at all possible
   locations. In this proposed method, the patterns of an element located
   at an arbitrary position on the platform are obtained by interpolating
   the element patterns at several sampled locations using the model-based
   parameter estimation (MBPE) method. This interpolation strategy consists
   of two steps. Firstly, it interpolates the Fourier coefficients of the
   given element patterns at the sampled locations to acquire the Fourier
   coefficients of the element patterns at the desired location. Then the
   inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) or the inverse fast Fourier
   transform (IFFT) algorithm is applied to obtain the element pattern.
   Compared with the conventional interpolation methods, this interpolation
   needs much fewer samples in the spatial domain and a smaller number of
   interpolation parameters. The element layout is optimised by the
   particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method. For each layout, the array
   excitations are obtained by the robust convex optimisation method. This
   proposed method is demonstrated through an optimisation on a
   cylindrical-parabolic conformal array}},

Abstract = {{Rolling leukocytes deform and show a large area of contact with
   endothelium under physiological flow conditions. We studied the effect
   of cytoplasmic viscosity on leukocyte rolling using our
   three-dimensional numerical algorithm that treats leukocyte as a
   compound droplet in which the core phase (nucleus) and the shell phase
   (cytoplasm) are viscoelastic fluids. The algorithm includes the
   mechanical properties of the cell cortex by cortical tension and
   considers leukocyte microvilli that deform viscoelastically and form
   viscous tethers at supercritical force. Stochastic binding kinetics
   describes binding of adhesion molecules. The leukocyte cytoplasmic
   viscosity plays a critical role in leukocyte rolling on an adhesive
   substrate. High-viscosity cells are characterized by high mean rolling
   velocities, increased temporal fluctuations in the instantaneous
   velocity, and a high probability for detachment from the substrate. A
   decrease in the rolling velocity, drag, and torque with the formation of
   a large, flat contact area in low-viscosity cells leads to a dramatic
   decrease in the bond force and stable rolling. Using values of viscosity
   consistent with step aspiration studies of human neutrophils (5-30
   Pa.s), our computational model predicts the velocities and shape changes
   of rolling leukocytes as observed in vitro and in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{We develop both stable and stabilized methods for imposing Dirichlet

   The stable method makes use of the vital vertex algorithm to develop a

   stabilized method, on the other hand, follows a Nitsche type variational
   approach for three-dimensional surfaces. Algorithmic and
   implementational details of both methods are provided. Several
   three-dimensional benchmark problems are studied to compare and contrast
   the accuracy of the two approaches. The results indicate that both
   methods yield optimal rates of convergence in various quantities of
   interest, with the primary differences being in the surface flux. The
   utility of the domain integral for extracting accurate surface fluxes is
   demonstrated for both techniques. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

   alloys}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{In Fe-Pd alloys, the competing geometric (fcc versus bcc) and magnetic
   tendencies result in rich phase stability and ordering physics. Here, we
   study these alloys via a first principles mixed-basis cluster expansion
   (CE) approach. Highly accurate fcc and bcc CEs are iteratively and
   self-consistently constructed using a genetic algorithm, based on the
   first principles results for similar to 100 ordered structures. The
   structural and magnetic ``filters{''} are introduced to determine
   whether a fully relaxed structure is of fcc/bcc and high-/low-spin
   types. All structures satisfying the Lifshitz condition for stability in
   extended phase diagram regions are included as inputs to our CEs. We
   find that in a wide composition range (with more than 1/3 atomic content
   of Fe), an fcc-constrained alloy has a single stable ordered compound,
   L1(0) FePd. However, L1(0) is higher in energy than the phase-separated
   mixture of bcc Fe and fcc-FePd2 (beta 2 structure) at low temperatures.
   In the Pd-rich composition range, we find several fcc beta 2-like ground
   states: FePd2 (beta 2), Fe3Pd9, Fe2Pd7, FePd5, Fe2Pd13, and FePd8, yet
   we do not find FePd3 with the the experimentally observed L1(2)
   structure. Fcc Monte Carlo simulations show a transformation from any of
   the attempted beta 2-like ground states directly into a disordered
   alloy. We suggest that the phonon and/or spin excitation contributions
   to the free energy are responsible for the observed stability of L1(2)
   at higher temperatures, and likely lead to a beta 2 <-> L1(2)
   transition. Finally, we present here a complete characterization of all
   the fcc and bcc Lifshitz structures, i.e., the structures with ordering
   vectors exclusively at high-symmetry k points.}},

Title = {{Emergent bursting and synchrony in computer simulations of neuronal
   cultures}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Experimental studies of neuronal cultures have revealed a wide variety
   of spiking network activity ranging from sparse, asynchronous firing to
   distinct, network-wide synchronous bursting. However, the functional
   mechanism driving these observed firing patterns are not well
   understood. In this work, we develop an in silico network of cortical
   neurons based on known features of similar in vitro networks. The
   activity from these simulations is found to closely mimic experimental
   data. Futhermore, the strength or degree of network bursting is found to
   depend on a few parameters: the density of the culture, the type of
   synaptic connections, and the ration of excitatory neutrons is
   increased. Interestingly, biologically prevalent values of parameters
   result in networks that are at the transition between strong bursting
   and sparse firing. Using principal components analysis, we show that a
   large fraction of the variance in firing rates is captured by the first
   component for bursting networks. These results have implications for
   understanding how information is encoded at the population level as well
   as for why certain network parameters are ubiquitous in cortical tissue.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the stability of a milling process with
   simultaneously engaged flutes using the state-space TFEA and Chebyshev
   collocation methods. In contrast to prior works, multiple flute
   engagement due to both the high depth of cut and high step-over distance
   are considered. A particular outcome of this study is the demonstration
   of a different stability behavior in comparison to prior works. To
   elaborate, period-doubling regions are shown to appear at relatively
   high radial immersions when multiple flutes with either a zero or
   nonzero helix angle are simultaneously cutting. We also demonstrate
   stability differences that arise due to the parity in the number of
   flutes, especially at full radial immersion. In addition, we study other
   features induced by helical tools such as the waviness of the Hopf
   lobes, the sensitivity of the period-doubling islands to the radial
   immersion, as along with the orientation of the islands with respect to
   the Hopf lobes. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005022]}},

Abstract = {{When properly constructed, biased estimators are known to produce lower

   estimates into the final estimate of a displacement. This is
   accomplished by using adjacent estimates to create a prior probability

   how the prior probability impacts the final estimate. The results show
   that with estimation quality on the order of the Cramer-Rao lower bound
   at adjacent locations, the local estimate in question should generally
   exceed the Cramer-Rao lower-bound limitations on performance of an

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. This study was conducted to determine whether there were
   significant differences in choroidal thickness, contrast, outer
   choroidal vessel (OCV), and choroidal-scleral junction (CSJ)
   visualization in inverted versus upright spectral-domain optical
   coherence tomography (SD-OCT).
   METHODS. Images were captured on Bioptigen SD-OCT, Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT,
   and Heidelberg Spectralis in 42 eyes of 21 healthy subjects. Average
   choroidal thickness across a fovea-centered 4-mm segment was determined
   with MATLAB. Quantitative measures of choroidal contrast were measured
   and CSJ assessed by applying a score of 0 to 3. OCV was determined by
   counting choroidal vessels >= 200 mu m.
   RESULTS. Mean choroidal thickness was greater in inverted versus upright
   images captured by Bioptigen (P <= 0.003) and Spectralis (P <= 0.015).
   Choroidal thickness varied significantly between the three machines (P <
   0.05). Contrast was higher in inverted versus upright images captured by
   Bioptigen (P <= 0.02) and Spectralis (P < 0.001), but not in Cirrus (P >
   0.10, both observers). CSJ score was highest in the following:
   Spectralis inverted = Spectralis EDI > Cirrus upright > Bioptigen
   inverted. Mean OCV was highest in Spectralis inverted mode.
   CONCLUSION. The most favorable modes to visualize CSJ and OCV are the
   Spectralis EDI, Spectralis inverted, Cirrus upright, and Bioptigen
   inverted. These modes demonstrate the highest outer choroidal contrast
   and choroidal thickness measurements. Choroidal thickness cannot be
   compared between machines due to conversion factor differences. Future
   studies and construction of automated segmentation and detection
   software should take these benefits and pitfalls into account. (Invest

Abstract = {{Graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are fascinating materials, both
   scientifically and technologically, due to their exceptional properties
   and potential use in applications ranging from high-frequency
   electronics to energy storage devices. This manuscript introduces a
   hybrid structure consisting of graphitic foliates grown along the length
   of aligned multiwalled CNTs. The foliate density and layer thickness
   vary as a function of deposition conditions, and a model is proposed for
   their nucleation and growth. The hybrid structures were studied using
   electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The foliates consist of
   edges that approach the dimensions of graphene and provide enhanced
   charge storage capacity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   indicated that the weight-specific capacitance for the graphenated CNTs
   was 5.4x that of similar CNTs without the graphitic foliates. Pulsed
   charge injection measurements demonstrated a 7.3x increase in
   capacitance per unit area. These data suggest that this unique structure
   integrates the high surface charge density of the graphene edges with
   the high longitudinal conductivity of the CNTs and may have significant
   impact in charge storage and related applications.}},

Abstract = {{Soil heterotrophic respiration and nutrient mineralization are strongly
   affected by environmental conditions, in particular by moisture
   fluctuations triggered by rainfall events. When soil moisture decreases,
   so does decomposers' activity, with microfauna generally undergoing
   stress sooner than bacteria and fungi. Despite differences in the
   responses of individual decomposer groups to moisture availability
   (e.g., bacteria are typically more sensitive than fungi to water
   stress), we show that responses of decomposers at the community level
   are different in soils and surface litter, but similar across biomes and
   climates. This results in a nearly constant soil-moisture threshold
   corresponding to the point when biological activity ceases, at a water
   potential of about -14 MPa in mineral soils and -36 MPa in surface
   litter. This threshold is shown to be comparable to the soil moisture
   value where solute diffusion becomes strongly inhibited in soil, while
   in litter it is dehydration rather than diffusion that likely limits
   biological activity around the stress point. Because of these intrinsic
   constraints and lack of adaptation to different hydro-climatic regimes,
   changes in rainfall patterns (primary drivers of the soil moisture
   balance) may have dramatic impacts on soil carbon and nutrient cycling.}},

Abstract = {{Modern wireless interfaces support a physical-layer capability called
   Message in Message (MIM). Briefly, MIM allows a receiver to disengage

   Links that otherwise conflict with each other can be made concurrent
   with MIM. However, the concurrency is not immediate and can be achieved
   only if conflicting links begin transmission in a specific order. The
   importance of link order is new in wireless research, motivating
   MIM-aware revisions to link-scheduling protocols. This paper identifies
   the opportunity in MIM-aware reordering, characterizes the optimal
   improvement in throughput, and designs a link-layer protocol for
   enterprise wireless LANs to achieve it. Testbed and simulation results
   confirm the performance gains of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless transmitter learns of a packet loss and infers collision only
   after completing the entire transmission. If the transmitter could
   detect the collision early {[}such as with carrier sense multiple access
   with collision detection (CSMA/CD) in wired networks], it could
   immediately abort its transmission, freeing the channel for useful
   communication. There are two main hurdles to realize CSMA/CD in wireless
   networks. First, a wireless transmitter cannot simultaneously transmit
   and listen for a collision. Second, any channel activity around the
   transmitter may not be an indicator of collision at the receiver. This
   paper attempts to approximate CSMA/CD in wireless networks with a novel
   scheme called CSMA/CN (collision notification). Under CSMA/CN, the
   receiver uses PHY-layer information to detect a collision and
   immediately notifies the transmitter. The collision notification
   consists of a unique signature, sent on the same channel as the data.
   The transmitter employs a listener antenna and performs signature
   correlation to discern this notification. Once discerned, the
   transmitter immediately aborts the transmission. We show that the
   notification signature can be reliably detected at the listener antenna,
   even in the presence of a strong self-interference from the transmit
   antenna. A prototype testbed of 10 USRP/GNU Radios demonstrates the
   feasibility and effectiveness of CSMA/CN.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a harmonic version of the short-lag spatial coherence
   (SLSC) imaging technique, called harmonic spatial coherence imaging
   (HSCI). The method is based on the coherence of the second-harmonic
   backscatter. Because the same signals that are used to construct
   harmonic B-mode images are also used to construct HSCI images, the
   benefits obtained with harmonic imaging are also obtained with HSCI.
   Harmonic imaging has been the primary tool for suppressing clutter in
   diagnostic ultrasound imaging, however second-harmonic echoes are not
   necessarily immune to the effects of clutter. HSCI and SLSC imaging are
   less sensitive to clutter because clutter has low spatial coherence.
   HSCI shows favorable imaging characteristics such as improved
   contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), improved speckle SNR, and better
   delineation of borders and other structures compared with fundamental
   and harmonic B-mode imaging. CNRs of up to 1.9 were obtained from in
   vivo imaging of human cardiac tissue with HSCI, compared with 0.6, 0.9,
   and 1.5 in fundamental B-mode, harmonic B-mode, and SLSC imaging,
   respectively. In vivo experiments in human liver tissue demonstrated
   SNRs of up to 3.4 for HSCI compared with 1.9 for harmonic B-mode.
   Nonlinear simulations of a heart chamber model were consistent with the
   in vivo experiments.}},

Abstract = {{New methods for inducing microscopic particles to assemble into useful
   macroscopic structures could open pathways for fabricating complex
   materials that cannot be produced by lithographic methods. Here we
   demonstrate a colloidal assembly technique that uses two parameters to
   tune the assembly of over 20 different pre-programmed structures,
   including kagome, honeycomb and square lattices, as well as various
   chain and ring configurations. We programme the assembled structures by
   controlling the relative concentrations and interaction strengths
   between spherical magnetic and non-magnetic beads, which behave as
   paramagnetic or diamagnetic dipoles when immersed in a ferrofluid. A
   comparison of our experimental observations with potential energy
   calculations suggests that the lowest energy configuration within binary
   mixtures is determined entirely by the relative dipole strengths and
   their relative concentrations.}},

Title = {{Tension and Robustness in Multitasking Cellular Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cellular networks multitask by exhibiting distinct, context-dependent
   dynamics. However, network states (parameters) that generate a
   particular dynamic are often sub-optimal for others, defining a source
   of ``tension{''} between them. Though multitasking is pervasive, it is
   not clear where tension arises, what consequences it has, and how it is
   resolved. We developed a generic computational framework to examine the
   source and consequences of tension between pairs of dynamics exhibited
   by the well-studied RB-E2F switch regulating cell cycle entry. We found
   that tension arose from task-dependent shifts in parameters associated
   with network modules. Although parameter sets common to distinct
   dynamics did exist, tension reduced both their accessibility and
   resilience to perturbation, indicating a trade-off between
   ``one-size-fits-all{''} solutions and robustness. With high tension,
   robustness can be preserved by dynamic shifting of modules, enabling the
   network to toggle between tasks, and by increasing network complexity,
   in this case by gene duplication. We propose that tension is a general
   constraint on the architecture and operation of multitasking biological
   networks. To this end, our work provides a framework to quantify the
   extent of tension between any network dynamics and how it affects
   network robustness. Such analysis would suggest new ways to interfere
   with network elements to elucidate the design principles of cellular
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that ultra-large complexes (ULCs) of platelet
   factor 4 (PF4) and heparin (H) play an essential role in the
   pathogenesis of heparin-induced throw bocytopenia (HIT), an
   immune-mediated disorder caused by PF4/H antibodies. Because antigenic
   PF4/H ULCs assemble through non-specific electrostatic interactions, we
   reasoned that disruption of charge-based interactions can modulate the
   immune response to antigen. We tested a minimally anticoagulant compound
   (2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin, ODSH) with preserved charge to disrupt
   PF4/H complex formation and immunogenicity. We show that ODSH disrupts
   complexes when added to pre-formed PF4/H ULCs and prevents ULC formation
   when incubated simultaneously with PF4 and UFH. In other studies, we
   show that excess ODSH reduces HIT antibody (Ab) binding in immunoassays
   and that PF4/ODSH complexes do not cross-react with HITAbs.When ODSH and
   unfractionated heparin (UFH) are mixed at equimolar concentrations, we
   show that there is a negligible effect on amount of protamine required
   for heparin neutralisation and reduced immunogenicity of PF4/UFH in the
   presence of ODSH. Taken together, these studies suggest that ODSH can be
   used concurrently with UFH to disrupt PF4/H charge interactions and
   provides a novel strategy to reduce antibody mediated complications in
   HIT.}},

Title = {{A computerized scheme for lung nodule detection in multiprojection chest

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Our previous study indicated that multiprojection chest
   radiography could significantly improve radiologists' performance for
   lung nodule detection in clinical practice. In this study, the authors
   further verify that multiprojection chest radiography can greatly
   improve the performance of a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) scheme.
   Methods: Our database consisted of 59 subjects, including 43 subjects
   with 45 nodules and 16 subjects without nodules. The 45 nodules included
   7 real and 38 simulated ones. The authors developed a conventional CAD
   scheme and a new fusion CAD scheme to detect lung nodules. The
   conventional CAD scheme consisted of four steps for (1) identification
   of initial nodule candidates inside lungs, (2) nodule candidate
   segmentation based on dynamic programming, (3) extraction of 33 features
   from nodule candidates, and (4) false positive reduction using a
   piecewise linear classifier. The conventional CAD scheme processed each
   of the three projection images of a subject independently and discarded
   the correlation information between the three images. The fusion CAD
   scheme included the four steps in the conventional CAD scheme and two
   additional steps for (5) registration of all candidates in the three
   images of a subject, and (6) integration of correlation information
   between the registered candidates in the three images. The integration
   step retained all candidates detected at least twice in the three images
   of a subject and removed those detected only once in the three images as
   false positives. A leave-one-subject-out testing method was used for
   evaluation of the performance levels of the two CAD schemes.
   Results: At the sensitivities of 70\%, 65\%, and 60\%, our conventional
   CAD scheme reported 14.7, 11.3, and 8.6 false positives per image,
   respectively, whereas our fusion CAD scheme reported 3.9, 1.9, and 1.2
   false positives per image, and 5.5, 2.8, and 1.7 false positives per
   patient, respectively. The low performance of the conventional CAD
   scheme may be attributed to the high noise level in chest radiography,
   and the small size and low contrast of most nodules.
   Conclusions: This study indicated that the fusion of correlation
   information in multiprojection chest radiography can markedly improve
   the performance of CAD scheme for lung nodule detection. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Bi-segmental Au/Ni nanorods immobilized with doxorubicin and folate in a
   spatially controlled manner were fabricated for potential nanomedicine
   applications. Template-based electrodeposition was used to fabricate the
   multi-segmented rod-shaped nanostructures 100 nm in diameter and 1-2 mu
   m in length. Thiolated Pluronic was immobilized on the gold surface to
   take advantage of its sol-gel transition to enhance the entrapment of
   doxorubicin on the nanorods. The ratio of doxorubicin to folate can be
   precisely controlled by varying the length of their respective segments.
   Doxorubicin-incorporated nanorods showed reversible release-association
   behavior of doxorubicin according to temperature change, and the degree
   of thermo-responsiveness was dependent on the length of the gold
   segments. A549 cells incubated with the doxorubicin nanorods at 4
   degrees C for 2 h showed increased localization of doxorubicin in the
   cytoplasm compared to non-treated groups; higher potency was also
   observed compared to doxorubicin-treated or non-treated groups. Folate
   targeting effect was demonstrated in the significantly increased
   endocytic uptake of nanorods by the folate receptor overexpressing KB
   cells. The versatility of fabricating these multi-segmented nanorods by
   electrodeposition may open up interesting possibilities of designing
   multi-functional nanocarriers for diverse drug delivery applications.

Abstract = {{Targeted gene addition to mammalian genomes is central to biotechnology,
   basic research and gene therapy. For example, gene targeting to the
   ROSA26 locus by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells is
   commonly used for mouse transgenesis to achieve ubiquitous and
   persistent transgene expression. However, conventional methods are not
   readily adaptable to gene targeting in other cell types. The emerging
   zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology facilitates gene targeting in
   diverse species and cell types, but an optimal strategy for engineering
   highly active ZFNs is still unclear. We used a modular assembly approach
   to build ZFNs that target the ROSA26 locus. ZFN activity was dependent
   on the number of modules in each zinc finger array. The ZFNs were active
   in a variety of cell types in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The
   ZFNs directed gene addition to the ROSA26 locus, which enhanced the
   level of sustained gene expression, the uniformity of gene expression
   within clonal cell populations and the reproducibility of gene
   expression between clones. These ZFNs are a promising resource for cell
   engineering, mouse transgenesis and pre-clinical gene therapy studies.
   Furthermore, this characterization of the modular assembly method
   provides general insights into the implementation of the ZFN technology.}},

Abstract = {{Passive and semipassive UHF RF identification (RFID) systems have
   traditionally been designed using scalar-valued differential radar cross
   section (DRCS) methods to model the backscattered signal from the tag.
   This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily
   limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and
   the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from
   an RFID tag. Considering modulated backscatter in terms of
   complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature
   modulation of the backscatter channel.
   When compared with binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) or phase shift
   keying (PSK) based RFID systems, which transmit 1 bit of data per symbol
   period, and thus 1 bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags
   employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than 1 bit per
   symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol
   clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended
   read range. Alternatively, tags employing an M-ary modulator can achieve
   log(2) M higher data throughput at essentially the same dc power
   consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK.
   In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by
   passive and semipassive UHF RFID tags, such as tags compliant with the
   widely used ISO18000-6c standard, this paper explores a novel
   CMOS-compatible method for generating M-ary quadrature amplitude
   modulated (QAM) backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for
   designing an inductorless M-ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an
   array of switched resistances and capacitances. Device-level simulation
   and measurements of a four-state phase shift keying (4-PSK)/four-state
   quadrature amplitude modulated (4-QAM) modulator are provided for a
   semipassive (battery-assisted) tag operating in the 850-950-MHz band.
   This first prototype modulator transmits 4-PSK/4-QAM at a symbol rate of
   200 kHz and a bit rate of 400 kb/s at a static power dissipation of only
   115 nW.}},

   Previous techniques for biochip testing are limited to regular

   (ATPG) method for non-regular digital microfluidic chips. The ATPG
   method can generate test patterns to detect catastrophic defects in
   non-regular arrays where the full reconfigurability of the digital
   microfluidic platform is not utilized. It automates test-stimulus design
   and test-resource selection, in order to minimize the test application
   time. We also present an integer linear programming model for the
   compaction of test patterns, while maintaining the desired fault
   coverage. We utilize two fabricated biochips with non-regular
   microfluidic arrays to evaluate the proposed ATPG method.}},

Abstract = {{Nonviral delivery of nucleic acids is a potentially safe and viable
   therapeutic modality for inherited and acquired diseases. However,
   current systems have proven too inefficient for widespread clinical
   translation. The rational design of improved carriers depends on a
   quantitative, mechanistic understanding of the rate-limiting barriers to
   efficient intracellular delivery. Separation of the nucleic acid from
   the carrier is one of the barriers, which may be analyzed by Forster
   resonance energy transfer (FRET), a mechanism used to detect
   interactions between fluorescently labeled molecules. When applied to
   the molecular components of polymer or lipid-based nanocomplexes, FRET
   provides information on their complexation status, uptake, release and
   degradation. Recently, the design of FRET systems incorporating quantum
   dots as energy donors has led to improved signal stability, allowing
   prolonged measurements, as well as increased sensitivity, enabling
   direct detection and the potential for multiplexing. The union of
   quantum dots and FRET is providing new insights into the mechanisms of
   nonviral nucleic acid delivery through convergent characterization of
   delivery barriers, and has the potential to accelerate the design of
   improved carriers to realize the potential of nucleic acid therapeutics
   and gene medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Axial flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are a significant
   improvement in mechanical circulatory support. However, patients with
   these devices experience degradation of large von Willebrand factor
   (vWF) multimers, which is associated with bleeding and may be caused by
   high shear stresses within the LVAD. In this study, we used
   computational fluid mechanics to determine the wall shear stresses,
   shear rates, and residence times in a centrifugal LVAD and assess the
   impact on these variables caused by changing impeller speed and changing
   from a shrouded to a semi-open impeller. In both LVAD types, shear rates
   were well over 10 000/s in several regions. This is high enough to
   degrade vWF, but it is unclear if residence times, which were below 5 ms
   in high-shear regions, are long enough to allow vWF cleavage.
   Additionally, wall shear stresses were below the threshold stress of 10
   Pa only in the outlet tube so it is feasible to endothelialize this
   region to enhance its biocompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{No trouble found (NTF) due to functional failures is a common scenario
   today in board-level testing at system companies. A component on a board
   fails during the board-level functional test, but it passes the
   automatic test equipment (ATE) test when it is returned to the supplier
   for warranty replacement or service repair. To find the root cause of
   NTF, we propose an innovative functional test approach and discrete
   Fourier transform (DFT) methods for the detection of board-level
   functional failures. These DFT and test methods allow us to reproduce
   and detect functional failures in a controlled deterministic
   environment, and provide ATE tests to the supplier for early screening
   of defective parts. Experiments on an industry design show that the
   proposed functional scan test with appropriate functional constraints
   can adequately mimic the functional state space, as measured by
   appropriate coverage metrics. Experiments also show that most functional
   failures due to dominant bridging, crosstalk, and delay faults due to
   power supply noise can be reproduced and detected by functional scan
   test. We also describe two approaches to enhance the mimicking of the
   functional state space. The first approach allows us to select a given
   number of initial states in linear time and functional scan tests
   resulting from these selected states are used to mimic the functional
   state space. The second approach is based on controlled state injection.}},

Abstract = {{Lanthanum erbium carbide, La0.5Er0.5C2, a salt-like carbide with a cubic
   fluorite phase structure, has been produced from C-13, allowing carbon
   diffusion rate to be determined using C-12. Carbon in salt-like carbides
   exhibits significant ionicity, and a high carbon diffusion rate would
   enable a new class of high temperature fuel cells based on carbon-ion
   transport. The complete lack of carbon diffusion data for salt-like
   carbides is the motivation for this work. The carbon diffusion rate in
   La0.5Er0.5C2 has now been determined to be 2.0 +/- A 0.8 x 10(-13)
   cm(2)/s at 850 A degrees C, increasing to 1.8 +/- A 0.8 x 10(-11)
   cm(2)/s at 1150 A degrees C, with an activation energy of about 95
   kJ/mole. These diffusion rates are too low for a carbon-ion fuel cell,
   but a number of other salt-like carbides exist. Be2C, in particular, is
   a salt-like carbide with an antifluorite structure, and should have
   higher carbon-ion diffusion than cubic La0.5Er0.5C2 due to the
   unoccupied octahedral sites in the antifluorite structure, but Be2C
   presents special difficulties due to the toxic nature of its hydrolysis
   products.}},

Abstract = {{The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum associated with
   a gold nanoparticle (NP) coupled to a gold film exhibits extreme
   sensitivity to the nanogap region where the fields are tightly
   localized. The LSPR of an ensemble of film-coupled NPs can be observed
   using an illumination scheme similar to that used to excite the surface
   plasmon resonance (SPR) of a thin metallic film; however, in the present
   system, the light is used to probe the highly sensitive
   distance-dependent LSPR of the gaps between NPs and film rather than the
   delocalized SPR of the film. We show that the SPR and LSPR spectral
   contributions can be readily distinguished, and we compare the
   sensitivities of both modes to displacements in the average gap between
   a collection of NPs and the gold film. The distance by which the NPs are
   suspended in solution above the gold film is fixed via a thin molecular
   spacer layer and can be further modulated by subjecting the NPs to a
   quasistatic electric field. The observed LSPR spectral shifts triggered
   by the applied voltage can be correlated with angstrom scale
   displacements of the NPs, suggesting the potential for chip-scale or
   flow-cell plasmonic nanoruler devices with extreme sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware fault insertion is a promising method for system reliability
   assessment and fault isolation. It provides feedback on the fault
   tolerance of a large system, creates artificial faulty scenarios that
   can be used as reference points for fault diagnosis, and leads to a
   quality diagnostic program. Optimization of fault insertion location is
   critical for accelerating the assessment of system reliability and
   constructing a complete knowledge base for fault diagnosis. In this
   work, we construct a pin-level fault model that is able to effectively
   mimic the errors (effects) caused by physical defects within the
   component. A simulation framework and optimization techniques are
   proposed to select a minimum subset of output pins that can represent as
   many physical defects as possible. The optimization results provide
   guidelines on the fault insertion locations and the appropriate fault
   types for insertion. In addition, three intrinsic characteristics of
   output pins, including testability number, fan-in size, and transition
   counts, are analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed model is
   evaluated in terms of impact on system response and error-detection
   latency. Experimental results are presented for OpenCore benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{Here we show the fundamental tradeoffs that underpin the design of a
   distributed energy system with two objectives: the production and
   distribution of electric power driven by solar heating, and desalinated
   water produced by consuming solar power. We show analytically that
   larger solar power plants and desalination plants are more efficient
   than smaller plants. This phenomenon of economies of scale is countered
   by the greater losses associated with larger distribution networks. From
   this conflict emerges the proper allocation of nodes of production of
   power and water on a territory. We show that as the individual needs of
   power and water increase in time, the sizes of solar plants and
   desalination plants increase, and so does the size of the territory
   served by each power plant. At the same time, the territory served by
   each desalination plant decreases, and this means that the number of
   desalination plants allocated to one power plant increases. (C) 2012

Journal = {{MATRIX BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Aortic valve disease (AVD) occurs in 2.5\% of the general population and
   often requires surgical intervention. Aortic valve malformation (AVM)
   underlies the majority of cases, suggesting a developmental etiology.
   Elastin haploinsufficiency results in complex cardiovascular problems,
   and 20-45\% of patients have AVM and/or AVD. Elastin insufficient
   (Eln+/-) mice demonstrate AVM and latent AVD due to abnormalities in the
   valve annulus region. The objective of this study was to examine
   extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and biomechanical properties in
   regional aortic valve tissue and determine the impact of early AVM on
   late AVD in the Eln+/- mouse model. Aortic valve ECM composition and
   remodeling from juvenile, adult, and aged stages were evaluated in
   Eln+/- mice using histology, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and gelatin
   zymography. Aortic valve tissue biomechanical properties were determined
   using micropipette aspiration. Cartilage-like nodules were demonstrated
   within the valve annulus region at all stages identifying a
   developmental abnormality preceding AVD. Interestingly, maladaptive ECM
   remodeling was observed in early AVM without AVD and worsened with late
   AVD, as evidenced by increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity,
   as well as abnormalities in ADAMTS-mediated versican processing. Cleaved
   versican was increased in the valve annulus region of aged Eln+/- mice,
   and this abnormality correlated temporally with adverse alterations in
   valve tissue biomechanical properties and the manifestation of AVD.
   These findings identify maladaptive ECM remodeling in functional AVM as
   an early disease process with a progressive natural history, similar to
   that seen in human AVD, emphasizing the importance of the annulus region
   in pathogenesis. Combining molecular and engineering approaches provides
   complementary mechanistic insights that may be informative in the search
   for new therapeutic targets and durable valve bioprostheses. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Directionality in coupling, defined as the linkage relating causes to
   their effects at a later time, can be used to explain the core dynamics
   of ecological systems by untangling direct and feedback relationships
   between the different components of the systems. Inferring causality
   from measured ecological variables sampled through time remains a
   formidable challenge further made difficult by the action of periodic
   drivers overlapping the natural dynamics of the system. Periodicity in
   the drivers can often mask the self-sustained oscillations originating
   from the autonomous dynamics. While linear and direct causal
   relationships are commonly addressed in the time domain, using the
   well-established machinery of Granger causality (G-causality), the
   presence of periodic forcing requires frequency-based statistics (e. g.,
   the Fourier transform), able to distinguish coupling induced by
   oscillations in external drivers from genuine endogenous interactions.
   Recent nonparametric spectral extensions of G-causality to the frequency
   domain pave the way for the scale-by-scale decomposition of causality,
   which can improve our ability to link oscillatory behaviors of
   ecological networks to causal mechanisms. The performance of both
   spectral G-causality and its conditional extension for multivariate
   systems is explored in quantifying causal interactions within ecological
   networks. Through two case studies involving synthetic and actual time
   series, it is demonstrated that conditional G-causality outperforms
   standard G-causality in identifying causal links and their concomitant
   timescales.}},

Title = {{Bilateral pudendal afferent stimulation improves bladder emptying in
   rats with urinary retention}},
Journal = {{BJU INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To determine whether bilateral electrical stimulation (BiES) of the
   transected pudendal sensory nerves could further enhance the voiding
   efficiency beyond that produced by unilateral electrical stimulation
   (UniES) of transected pudendal afferents in rats with urinary retention.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   The efficiency of bladder emptying with either UniES or BiES of pudendal
   nerve afferents was measured after acute bilateral transection of the
   sensory branch of the pudendal nerve.
   The effects of UniES and BiES on voiding in a partially denervated
   bladder and acute spinal transection, respectively, were determined.
   RESULTS
   The voiding efficiency (VE) was reduced from 69 to 22\% after bilateral
   transection of the sensory branch of the pudendal nerve. UniES or BiES
   increased the VE to 49-62\%. Although in most instances BiES
   consistently generated more efficient bladder emptying than did UniES,
   these differences were not significant.
   Both UniES and BiES increased VE after unilateral pelvic nerve
   transection, demonstrating efficacy in a partially denervated bladder.
   The enhancement of VE by either UniES or BiES was preserved after acute
   T-9-T-10, demonstrating the spinal origin of this augmenting reflex.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The results of the present study are consistent with an essential role
   for pudendal sensory feedback in efficient bladder emptying, and
   unilateral and bilateral electrical activation of pudendal nerve
   afferents are equally efficient in improving bladder emptying in an
   animal model of urinary retention.
   This could provide an approach to improve bladder emptying in patients
   with non-obstructive urinary retention.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the characteristics of the secondary bubble
   cluster produced by an electrohydraulic lithotripter using high-speed
   imaging and passive cavitation detection techniques. The results showed
   that (i) the discrepancy of the collapse time between near a flat rigid
   boundary and in a free field of the secondary bubble cluster was not as
   significant as that by the primary one; (ii) the secondary bubble
   clusters were small but in a high bubble density and nonuniform in
   distribution, and they did not expand and aggregate significantly near a
   rigid boundary; and (iii) the corresponding bubble collapse was weaker
   with few microjet formation and bubble rebound. By applying a strong
   suction flow near the electrode tip, the production of the secondary
   shock wave (SW) and induced bubble cluster could be disturbed
   significantly, but without influence on the primary ones. Consequently,
   stone fragmentation efficiency was reduced from 41.2 +/- 7.1\% to 32.2
   +/- 3.5\% after 250 shocks (p<0.05). Altogether, these observations
   suggest that the secondary bubble cluster produced by an
   electrohydraulic lithotripter may contribute to its ability for
   effective stone fragmentation. (E-mail: yfzhou@ntu.edu.sg) (C) 2012

Title = {{Assessing the Location of Surface Plasmons Over Nanotriangle and

Abstract = {{The increasing popularity of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and surface
   enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor design based on nanotriangle or
   nanohole arrays, and the possibility to manufacture substrates at the
   transition between these plasmonic substrates, makes them ideal
   candidates for the establishment of structure property relationships.
   This work features near diffraction-limited Raman images and
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of nanotriangle and
   nanohole array substrates, which clearly demonstrate that the
   localization of the hot spot on these SERS substrates is significantly
   influenced by the ratio of diameter/periodicity (D/P). The experimental
   and simulation data reveal that the hot spots are located around
   nanotriangles (D/P = 1), characteristic of localized SPR. Decreasing the
   D/P ratio to 0.75-0.7 led to the creation of nanohole arrays, which
   promoted the excitation of a propagating surface plasmon (SP)
   delocalized over the metal network. The optimal SERS intensity was
   consistently achieved at this transition from nanotriangles to
   nanoholes, for every periodicity (650 nm to 1.5 mu m) and excitation
   wavelength (633 and 785 nm) investigated, despite the presence or
   absence of a plasmonic band near the laser excitation. Further
   decreasing the D/P ratio led to excitation of a localized SP located
   around the rim of nanohole arrays for D/P of 0.5-0.6, in agreement with
   previous reports. In addition, this manuscript provides the first
   evidence that the hot spots are positioned inside the hole for D/P of
   0.4, with the center being the region of highest electric field and
   Raman intensity. The compelling experimental evidence and FDTD
   simulations offer an overall understanding of the plasmonic properties
   of nanohole arrays as SERS and SPR sensors, which is of significant
   value in advancing the diversity of applications from such surfaces,}},

   complicated metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{We develop a numerical technique for simulating metamaterial
   electromagnetic response based on an adaptation of the discrete dipole
   approximation (DDA). Our approach reduces each constituent metamaterial
   element within the composite to a point dipole with electric and
   magnetic polarizabilities, rather than assuming a homogenized effective
   material. We first validate the approach by computing the scattering
   cross-section for a collection of densely spaced isotropic dipole
   moments arranged within a cylindrical area, and compare with the known
   result from Mie theory. The discrete dipole approach has considerable
   advantages for the design of gradient and transformation optical media
   based on metamaterials, since the absence of local periodicity in other
   common design approaches leaves them with questionable validity. Several
   variants of iconic cloaking structures are investigated to illustrate
   the method, in which we study the impact that different configurations
   of dipolar elements can have on cloak performance. The modeling of a
   complex medium as polarizable dipoles provides a much closer connection
   to actual metamaterial implementations, and can address key nonlocal
   phenomena, such as magnetoelectric coupling, not accessible to most
   current numerical metamaterial approaches.}},

Title = {{Altered Trabecular Bone Structure and Delayed Cartilage Degeneration in
   the Knees of Collagen VI Null Mice}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Mutation or loss of collagen VI has been linked to a variety of
   musculoskeletal abnormalities, particularly muscular dystrophies, tissue
   ossification and/or fibrosis, and hip osteoarthritis. However, the role
   of collagen VI in bone and cartilage structure and function in the knee
   is unknown. In this study, we examined the role of collagen VI in the
   morphology and physical properties of bone and cartilage in the knee
   joint of Col6a1(-/-) mice by micro-computed tomography (microCT),
   histology, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning microphotolysis
   (SCAMP). Col6a1(-/-) mice showed significant differences in trabecular
   bone structure, with lower bone volume, connectivity density, trabecular
   number, and trabecular thickness but higher structure model index and
   trabecular separation compared to Col6a1(+/+) mice. Subchondral bone
   thickness and mineral content increased significantly with age in
   Col6a1(+/+) mice, but not in Col6a1(-/-) mice. Col6a1(-/-) mice had
   lower cartilage degradation scores, but developed early, severe
   osteophytes compared to Col6a1(+/+) mice. In both groups, cartilage
   roughness increased with age, but neither the frictional coefficient nor
   compressive modulus of the cartilage changed with age or genotype, as
   measured by AFM. Cartilage diffusivity, measured via SCAMP, varied
   minimally with age or genotype. The absence of type VI collagen has
   profound effects on knee joint structure and morphometry, yet minimal
   influences on the physical properties of the cartilage. Together with
   previous studies showing accelerated hip osteoarthritis in Col6a1(-/-)
   mice, these findings suggest different roles for collagen VI at
   different sites in the body, consistent with clinical data.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Ever since its inception, a popular DNA motif called the cross tile has
   been recognized to self-assemble into addressable 2D templates
   consisting of periodic square cavities. Although this may be
   conceptually correct, in reality certain types of cross tiles can only
   form planar lattices if adjacent tiles are designed to bind in a
   corrugated manner, in the absence of which they roll up to form 3D
   nanotube structures. Here we present a theoretical study on why
   uncorrugated cross tiles self-assemble into counterintuitive 3D nanotube
   structures and not planar 2D lattices. Coarse-grained normal mode
   analysis of single and multiple cross tiles within the elastic network
   model was carried out to expound the vibration modes of the systems.
   While both single and multiple cross tile simulations produce results
   conducive to tube formations, the dominant modes of a unit of four cross
   tiles (one square cavity), termed a quadruplet, fully reflect the
   symmetries of the actual nanotubes found in experiments and firmly
   endorse circularization of an array of cross tiles.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric energy harvesters exploiting strong mechanical
   nonlinearities exhibit intrinsic suitability for one of several modern
   challenges in vibratory energy harvesting: consistent kinetic
   performance in the presence of broadband environmental excitation. In
   particular, the bistable piezoelectric generator has been prolifically
   examined. However, most of the relevant literature relies on numerical
   simulation of specific experimental realizations to demonstrate superior
   performance. Due to the complexities and lack of analytical solutions
   for such designs, streamlined methods for parameter
   optimization,potential well shaping, optimal electromechanical coupling
   considerations, and other design methodologies are thus inhibited. To
   facilitate future innovation and research, this paper employs techniques
   from chaotic dynamical systems theory to provide a simplified analytical
   framework such that deeper insight into the performance of the bistable
   piezoelectric inertial generator may be obtained. Specifically, Melnikov
   theory is investigated to provide metrics for which homoclinic
   bifurcation may occur in the presence of harmonic, multi-frequency, and
   broadband excitation. The analysis maintains full consideration of the
   electromechanical coupling and electrical impedance effects and predicts
   that for range of dimensionless electrical impedance values, the
   threshold for chaotic motion and other high-energy solutions is
   significantly influenced. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we introduce fully digital selective ZnO nanowire array
   growth on inkjet-printed seed patterning. Through proper natural
   convection suppression during hydrothermal growth, successful ZnO
   nanowire local growth can be achieved. Without any need for
   photolithographic processing or stamp preparation, the nanowire growth
   location can be easily modified when the inkjet printing process is
   integrated with a CAD (computer-aided design) system to allow a high
   degree of freedom when the design needs to be changed. The current
   proposed process is very fast, low-cost, environmentally benign, and
   low-temperature. Therefore, it can be applied to a flexible plastic
   substrate and scaled up for larger substrates for mass production or
   roll-to-roll processing.}},

Abstract = {{Red blood cells are frequently deformed and their cytoskeletal proteins
   such as spectrin and ankyrin-R are repeatedly subjected to mechanical
   forces. While the mechanics of spectrin was thoroughly investigated in
   vitro and in vivo, little is known about the mechanical behavior of
   ankyrin-R. In this study, we combine coarse-grained steered molecular
   dynamics simulations and atomic force spectroscopy to examine the
   mechanical response of ankyrin repeats (ARs) in a model synthetic AR
   protein NI6C, and in the D34 fragment of native ankyrin-R when these
   proteins are subjected to various stretching geometry conditions. Our
   steered molecular dynamics results, supported by AFM measurements,
   reveal an unusual mechanical anisotropy of ARs: their mechanical
   stability is greater when their unfolding is forced to propagate from
   the N-terminus toward the C-terminus (repeats unfold at similar to 60
   pN), as compared to the unfolding in the opposite direction (unfolding
   force similar to 30 pN). This anisotropy is also reflected in the
   complex refolding behavior of ARs. The origin of this unfolding and
   refolding anisotropy is in the various numbers of native contacts that
   are broken and formed at the interfaces between neighboring repeats
   depending on the unfolding/refolding propagation directions. Finally, we
   discuss how these complex mechanical properties of ARs in D34 may affect
   its behavior in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Current estimation of lung nodule size typically relies on uni- or
   bi-dimensional techniques. While new three-dimensional volume estimation
   techniques using MDCT have improved size estimation of nodules with
   irregular shapes, the effect of acquisition and reconstruction
   parameters on accuracy (bias) and precision (variance) of the new
   techniques has not been fully investigated. To characterize the volume
   estimation performance dependence on these parameters, an
   anthropomorphic chest phantom containing synthetic nodules was scanned
   and reconstructed with protocols across various acquisition and
   reconstruction parameters. Nodule volumes were estimated by a clinical
   lung analysis software package, LungVCAR. Precision and accuracy of the
   volume assessment were calculated across the nodules and compared
   between protocols via a generalized estimating equation analysis.
   Results showed that the precision and accuracy of nodule volume
   quantifications were dependent on slice thickness, with different
   dependences for different nodule characteristics. Other parameters
   including kVp, pitch, and reconstruction kernel had lower impact.
   Determining these technique dependences enables better volume
   quantification via protocol optimization and highlights the importance
   of consistent imaging parameters in sequential examinations.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is
   compromised by involuntary motion (e.g. respiration, cardiac activity).
   The feasibility of processing ultrasound echo data to automatically
   estimate 3D liver motion for real-time IMRT guidance was previously
   demonstrated, but performance was limited by an acquisition speed of 2
   volumes per second due to hardware restrictions of a mechanical linear
   array probe. Utilizing a 2D matrix array probe with parallel receive
   beamforming offered increased acquisition speeds and an opportunity to
   investigate the benefits of higher volume rates. In vivo livers of three
   volunteers were scanned with and without respiratory motion at volume
   rates of 24 and 48 Hz, respectively. Respiration was suspended via
   voluntary breath hold. Correlation-based, phase-sensitive 3D speckle
   tracking was applied to consecutively acquired volumes of echo data.
   Volumes were omitted at fixed intervals and 3D speckle tracking was
   reapplied to study the effect of lower scan rates. Results revealed
   periodic motion that corresponded with the heart rate or breathing cycle
   in the absence or presence of respiration, respectively. For
   cardiac-induced motion, volume rates for adequate tracking ranged from 8
   to 12 Hz and was limited by frequency discrepancies between tracking
   estimates from higher and lower frequency scan rates. Thus, the scan
   rate of volume data acquired without respiration was limited by the need
   to sample the frequency induced by the beating heart. In
   respiratory-dominated motion, volume rate limits ranged from 4 to 12 Hz,
   interpretable from the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) from tracking
   estimates at 24 Hz. While higher volume rates yielded RMSD values less
   than 1 mm in most cases, lower volume rates yielded RMSD values of 2-6
   mm.}},

Abstract = {{The propensity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) having two different
   polymer coatings (poly(vinylpyrrolidone), PVP, or gum arabic, GA) to
   aggregate, or to deposit to a reference surface (silica), was explored
   as a basis for differentiating the effect of surface coating on the
   stability of nanoparticles in aggregation and in deposition. Surface
   polymeric coatings stabilize nanoparticles against aggregation as shown
   by either an increased critical coagulation concentration as for
   PVP-coated AgNPs (AgPVP) or the absence of observable aggregation even
   at a high ionic strength as for GA-coated AgNPs (AgGA). In experiments
   of AgNPs deposition in a silica porous medium, dissimilar surfaces
   favored deposition, such as the case where polymer coatings were present
   on the AgNPs but were absent on the porous medium. The increased
   affinity of the AgNPs for the porous medium in this case may be
   explained by a shifted contact frontier where electrical double layer
   interaction is weaker. When coating polymers were introduced to the
   porous medium and allowed to preadsorb to the silica surfaces, the
   attachment efficiencies for both the AgPVP and AgGA were reduced due to

Abstract = {{The molecular weight of a polymer determines key optoelectronic device
   characteristics, such as internal morphology and charge transport.
   Therefore, it is important to ensure that polymer deposition techniques
   do not significantly alter the native polymer molecular weight. This
   work addresses polymers deposited by resonant infrared matrix-assisted
   pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE). By using a novel emulsion-based
   target technique, the deposition of smooth, contiguous films with no
   evidence of chemical degradation have been enabled. However, structural
   degradation via a reduction in molecular weight remains an open
   question. The common polymer standard, PMMA, and the optoelectronic
   polymers, P3HT and MEH-PPV, have been characterized before and after
   emulsion-based RIR-MAPLE deposition via gel permeation chromatography to
   determine if RIR-MAPLE affects the deposited polymer molecular weight.
   Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy measurements have also been conducted to verify
   the absence of chemical degradation. These measurements verify that
   there is no chemical degradation of the polymers, and that PMMA and P3HT
   show no structural degradation, but MEH-PPV exhibits a halving of the
   weight-averaged molecular weight after RIR-MAPLE deposition. Compared
   with competing laser deposition techniques, RIR-MAPLE is shown to have
   the least effect on the molecular weight of the resulting thin films.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The area of crops cultivated in extensive screenhouses is rapidly
   growing, especially in semi-arid and arid regions. Water vapour, carbon
   dioxide, and sensible heat released or taken up by crops within such
   protected environments can substantially alter the immediate
   micro-environment, which in turn, affects these fluxes. This amplified
   interaction between plants and their microclimate challenges simple
   assessments on how partially covering the crop by a screen modifies
   plant water uptake and photosynthesis. Via a newly proposed higher-order
   closure model, the effects of a screen on the mean flow field, turbulent
   stresses, radiative and energy fluxes, as well as scalar sources, sinks,
   fluxes, and mean scalar concentration within screenhouses are explored.
   As a starting point, an extensive screenhouse is assumed thereby
   reducing the sensitivity of the model results to the precise geometric
   configuration of the screenhouse. The model findings for the screenhouse
   are presented and referenced against their open field counterpart. The
   radiation modulation and changes to turbulent transport due to the
   presence of the screen are investigated. In general, the presence of a
   screen results in a warmer and more humid environment inside the
   screenhouse, promoting reductions in both canopy photosynthesis and
   transpiration. However, the overall effect of the screen is to enhance
   water-use efficiency thereby resulting in water savings for the same
   amount of gross primary production.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured carbons offer great promise in numerous electrode
   applications due to their high surface area and area specific
   capacitance. With the growing importance of energy applications in
   particular, a need has emerged to characterize the various forms of
   activated and nanostructured carbons in the context of their
   electrochemical charge-storage capacity. However, the use of gravimetric
   or area specific capacitance can be uninformative or even misleading due
   to the critical role of exposed linear edge density on charge-transfer
   processes; edges exhibit approximately 20x greater specific capacitance
   than basal planes. Thus, a more robust normalization is needed for
   materials that possess this extreme anisotropy. By classifying
   nanostructures based on linear edge density, a deeper understanding of
   materials performance can be obtained and a more informed comparison of
   nanostructures is enabled. This report provides a classification of
   carbon nanostructures based on the dimensional organization of their
   edge structures. Morphological benchmarks of the classification are
   provided, including a novel graphenated CNT hybrid which increases the
   linear edge density of nanostructured carbons by an order of magnitude.
   Geometric consideration of the dimensional nature of the edge
   organization enables quantification of the edge density per unit nominal
   area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a simple and low-cost technique for resolving the complex
   conjugate ambiguity in Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   that is applicable to many swept source OCT (SSOCT) systems. First, we
   review the principles of coherence revival, wherein an interferometer
   illuminated by an external cavity tunable laser (ECTL) exhibits
   interference fringes when the two arms of the interferometer are
   mismatched by an integer multiple of the laser cavity length. Second, we
   report observations that the spectral interferogram obtained from SSOCT
   systems employing certain ECTLs are automatically phase modulated when
   the arm lengths are mismatched this way. This phase modulation results
   in a frequency-shifted interferogram, effectively creating an
   extended-depth heterodyne SSOCT system without the use of acousto-optic
   or electro-optic modulators. We suggest that this phase modulation may
   be caused by the ECTL cavity optical pathlength varying slightly over
   the laser sweep, and support this hypothesis with numerical simulations.
   We also report on the successful implementation of this technique with
   two commercial swept source lasers operating at 840nm and 1040nm, with
   sweep rates of 8kHz and 100kHz respectively. The extended imaging depth
   afforded by this technique was demonstrated by measuring the sensitivity
   fall-off profiles of each laser with matched and mismatched
   interferometer arms. The feasibility of this technique for clinical
   systems is demonstrated by imaging the ocular anterior segments of
   healthy human volunteers. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Analogous to mechanical systems, modeling the electromagnetic (EM)
   performance of large and complex metamaterial structures requires the
   use of effective-medium/constitutive properties. Constitutive properties
   are critical for efficiently bridging the gap between subwavelength
   geometry and performance at the mesoscale. In this article, the
   temperature-dependent effective medium properties for a metamaterial
   electric-inductive-capacitive (ELC) resonator are described
   analytically. ELC structures are commonly used in metamaterial designs
   to provide a tailored electric response to EM waves. An equivalent
   circuit model, coupled with analytic expressions for the capacitances,
   inductance, and resistance of the ELC resonator, is utilized to describe
   how thermally induced mechanical strain and changes in material
   properties manifest as temperature-dependent permittivity and
   permeability curves for the metamaterial. The resulting analytic
   expressions account for the effects of spatial dispersion and losses.
   This article also details how the process may be expanded to similarly
   describe the temperature-dependent constitutive properties of
   metamaterial magnetic resonators.}},

Abstract = {{Here we show that the configuration of an inhabited area controls the
   time required by all the pedestrians to vacate the space. From the
   minimization of the global evacuation time emerges the optimal
   configuration of the area. This is a fundamental principle for designing
   living spaces with efficient evacuation quality, and it is demonstrated
   here with several simple building blocks that can be used as components
   of more complex living structures: single walkway, corner, and T-shaped
   walkway. We show analytically and numerically that the ratio of the
   widths of the stem and branches of the T-shaped walkway has an optimal
   value that facilitates the evacuation of all the inhabitants. This
   result is fundamental, and is the crowd-dynamics equivalent of the
   Hess-Murray rule for the ratio of diameters in bifurcated ducts with
   fluid flow. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{We propose a generalization of the two-dimensional eikonal-limit cloak
   derived from a conformal transformation to three dimensions. The
   proposed cloak is a spherical shell composed of only isotropic media; it
   operates in the transmission mode and requires no mirror or ground
   plane. Unlike the well-known omnidirectional spherical cloaks, it may
   reduce visibility of an arbitrary object only for a very limited range
   of observation angles. In the short-wavelength limit, this cloaking
   structure restores not only the trajectories of incident rays, but also
   their phase, which is a necessary ingredient to complete invisibility.

Abstract = {{We present a novel theory and computational algorithm for modeling
   electrical stimulation of nerve fibers in three dimensions. Our approach
   uses singular perturbation to separate the full 3D boundary value
   problem into a set of 2D ``transverse{''} problems coupled with a 1D
   ``longitudinal{''} problem. The resulting asymptotic model contains not
   one but two activating functions (AF): the longitudinal AF that drives
   the slow development of the mean transmembrane potential and the
   transverse AF that drives the rapid polarization of the fiber in the
   transverse direction. The asymptotic model is implemented for a
   prototype 3D cylindrical fiber with a passive membrane in an isotropic
   extracellular region. The validity of this approach is tested by
   comparing the numerical solution of the asymptotic model to the
   analytical solutions. The results show that the asymptotic model
   predicts steady-state transmembrane potential directly under the
   electrodes with the root mean square error of 0.539 mV, i.e., 1.04\% of
   the maximum transmembrane potential. Thus, this work has created a
   computationally efficient algorithm that facilitates studies of the
   complete spatiotemporal dynamics of nerve fibers in three dimensions.}},

Title = {{Plate-specific gain map correction for the improvement of detective
   quantum efficiency in computed radiography}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1495-1504}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this work is to improve the noise power spectrum
   (NPS), and thus the detective quantum efficiency (DQE), of computed
   radiography (CR) images by correcting for spatial gain variations
   specific to individual imaging plates. CR devices have not traditionally
   employed gain-map corrections, unlike the case with flat-panel
   detectors, because of the multiplicity of plates used with each reader.
   The lack of gain-map correction has limited the DQE(f) at higher
   exposures with CR. This current work describes a feasible solution to
   generating plate-specific gain maps.
   Methods: Ten high-exposure open field images were taken with an RQA5
   spectrum, using a sixth generation CR plate suspended in air without a
   cassette. Image values were converted to exposure, the plates registered
   using fiducial dots on the plate, the ten images averaged, and then
   high-pass filtered to remove low frequency contributions from field
   inhomogeneity. A gain-map was then produced by converting all pixel
   values in the average into fractions with mean of one. The resultant
   gain-map of the plate was used to normalize subsequent single images to
   correct for spatial gain fluctuation. To validate performance, the
   normalized NPS (NNPS) for all images was calculated both with and
   without the gain-map correction. Variations in the quality of correction
   due to exposure levels, beam voltage/spectrum, CR reader used, and
   registration were investigated.
   Results: The NNPS with plate-specific gain-map correction showed
   improvement over the noncorrected case over the range of frequencies
   from 0.15 to 2.5 mm(-1). At high exposure (40 mR), NNPS was 50\%-90\%
   better with gain-map correction than without. A small further
   improvement in NNPS was seen from carefully registering the gain-map
   with subsequent images using small fiducial dots, because of slight
   misregistration during scanning. Further improvement was seen in the
   NNPS from scaling the gain map about the mean to account for different
   beam spectra.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a simple gain-map can be used
   to correct for the fixed-pattern noise in a given plate and thus improve
   the DQE of CR imaging. Such a method could easily be implemented by
   manufacturers because each plate has a unique bar code and the gain-map
   for all plates associated with a reader could be stored for future
   retrieval. These experiments indicated that an improvement in NPS (and
   hence, DQE) is possible, depending on exposure level, over a wide range
   of frequencies with this technique. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{Vineyards were planted in the arid region of northwest China to meet the
   local economic strategy while reducing agricultural water use. Sap flow,
   environmental variables, a plant characteristic (sapwood-to-leaf area
   ratio, A(s)/A(l)) and a canopy characteristic (leaf area index, L) were
   measured in a vineyard in the region during the growing season of 2009,
   and hourly canopy stomatal conductance (G(si)) was estimated for
   individual vines to quantify the relationships between G(si) and these
   variables. After accounting for the effects of vapor pressure deficit
   (D) and solar radiation (R-s) on G(si), much of the remaining variation
   of reference G(si) (G(siR)) was driven by that of leaf-specific
   hydraulic conductivity, which in turn was driven by that of A(s)/A(l).
   After accounting for that effect on G(siR), appreciable temporal
   variation remained in the decline rate of G(siR) with decreasing
   vineyard-averaged relative extractable soil water (theta(E)). This
   variation was related to the differential decline of theta(E) near each
   monitored vine, decreasing faster between irrigation events near vines
   where L was greater, thus adding to the spatiotemporal variation of
   G(siR) observed in the vineyard. We also found that the vines showed
   isohydric-like behavior when theta(E) was low, but switched to
   anisohydric-like behavior with increasing theta(E). Modeled theta(E) and
   associated G(s) of a canopy with even L (1.9 m(2) m(-2)) were greater
   than that of the same average L but split between the lowest and highest
   L observed along sections of rows in the vineyard (1.2 and 2.6 m(2)
   m(-2)) by 6 and 12\%, respectively. Our results suggest that managing
   sectional L near the average, rather than allowing a wide variation, can
   reduce soil water depletion, maintaining G(s) higher, thus potentially
   enhancing yield.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the behavior of a spatial elastica in a
   gravitational field. The slenderness of the system considered is such
   that the weight becomes an important consideration in determining
   elastic equilibrium configurations. Both ends of the elastica are
   clamped in an initially (planar) horizontal orientation at a fixed
   distance apart. However, one of the ends allows an increase in
   arc-length, that is, it is a sleeve joint. Thus, the total arc-length is
   the primary control parameter. This kind of elastica typically loses
   stability, resulting in out-of-plane deflections, when the total
   arc-length is increased beyond a critical value. A small mid-length
   torque can used to perturb a planar equilibrium configuration in order
   to test for stability. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of
   self-weight of the elastica (which is typically ignored) on promoting or
   delaying the loss of stability. To this end, it is useful to compare and
   contrast the results of orientation, that is, the system is configured
   in both an initial ``upright{''} orientation and then in an
   ``upside-down{''} orientation to highlight the influence of gravity. The
   results of the weightless elastica are used as a reference. Analysis is
   based on Kirchhoff's rod theory and Euler parameters, and the resulting
   set of governing differential equations are solved using a shooting
   method. The results from an experimental system using a slender
   superelastic wire made from Nitinol (Nickel Titanium Naval Ordnance
   Laboratory) exhibit close agreement with the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a cross-phase modulation measurement technique based on

Abstract = {{Accurate, economical and high-throughput gene and genome synthesis is
   essential to the development of synthetic biology and biotechnology. New
   large-scale gene synthesis methods harnessing the power of DNA
   microchips have recently been demonstrated. Yet, the technology is still
   compromised by a high occurrence of errors in the synthesized products.
   These errors still require substantial effort to correct. To solve this
   bottleneck, novel approaches based on new chemistry, enzymology or next
   generation sequencing have emerged. This review discusses these new
   trends and promising strategies of error filtration, correction and
   prevention in de novo gene and genome synthesis. Continued innovation in
   error correction technologies will enable affordable and large-scale
   gene and genome synthesis in the near future.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{94-103}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Power-law scaling is an ubiquitous feature of the power spectrum of
   streamflow on the daily to monthly timescales where the spectrum is most
   strongly affected by hydrologic catchment-scale processes. Numerous
   mechanistic explanations for the emergence of this power-law scaling
   have been proposed. This study employs empirical spectra obtained for
   eight river basins in the South Eastern US and synthetic spectra
   generated from a range of proposed mechanisms to explore these
   explanations. The empirical analysis suggested that streamflow spectra
   were characterized by multiple power-law scaling regimes with
   high-frequency exponents alpha in the range -1 to -5. In the studied
   basins, alpha tended to increase with drainage area. The power-law
   generating mechanisms analyzed included linear and non-linear catchment
   water balance arguments, power-law recession behavior, autonomous and
   non-autonomous responses of channel hydraulics and the n-fold
   convolution of linear reservoirs underpinning Dooge or Nash hydrographs.
   Of these mechanisms, only n-fold convolutions with n = 2 or 3 generated
   power spectra with features that were consistent with the empirical
   cases. If the effects of daily streamflow sampling on truncating power
   spectra were considered, then the trends in alpha with drainage area
   were also consistent with this mechanism. Generalizing the linear
   convolution approach to a network of reservoirs with randomly
   distributed parameters preserved the features of the power spectrum and
   maintained consistency with empirical spectra. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Granules of mast cells (MCs) enhance adaptive immunity when, on

   a carbohydrate backbone with encapsulated inflammatory mediators such as
   tumour necrosis factor, replicate attributes of MCs in vivo including
   the targeting of draining lymph nodes and the timed release of the
   encapsulated mediators. When used as an adjuvant during vaccination of
   mice with haemagglutinin from the influenza virus, the particles
   enhanced adaptive immune responses and increased survival of mice on
   lethal challenge. Furthermore, differential loading of the particles
   with the cytokine IL-12 directed the character of the response towards
   Th1 lymphocytes. The synthetic MC adjuvants replicate and enhance the
   functions of MCs during vaccination, and can be extended to polarize the

Abstract = {{Observations in many applications consist of counts of discrete events,
   such as photons hitting a detector, which cannot be effectively modeled
   using an additive bounded or Gaussian noise model, and instead require a
   Poisson noise model. As a result, accurate reconstruction of a spatially
   or temporally distributed phenomenon (f(star)) from Poisson data (y)
   cannot be effectively accomplished by minimizing a conventional
   penalized least-squares objective function. The problem addressed in
   this paper is the estimation of f(star) from in an inverse problem
   setting, where the number of unknowns may potentially be larger than the
   number of observations and f(star) admits sparse approximation. The
   optimization formulation considered in this paper uses a penalized
   negative Poisson log-likelihood objective function with nonnegativity
   constraints (since Poisson intensities are naturally nonnegative). In
   particular, the proposed approach incorporates key ideas of using
   separable quadratic approximations to the objective function at each
   iteration and penalization terms related to l(1) norms of coefficient
   vectors, total variation seminorms, and partition-based multiscale
   estimation methods.}},

Abstract = {{A new mechanism for fan stator vane failure in turbofan engines at high
   speed and high loading has been identified and reported in this paper.
   Highly destructive vane failures have been encountered at Honeywell in a
   development fan with composite stator vanes. Measured data indicated
   nonlinear high amplitude vibratory response in fan stator vanes on the
   stall side of the fan map at high speeds. Analysis showed that under
   certain steady loading, vane fixity at the hub could change,
   significantly reducing the vane natural frequency. At this lower natural
   frequency, the vane was found to be aeroelastically unstable, and
   calculated response exhibited characteristics similar to those observed
   during failure. An engine test conducted to validate the role of hub
   fixity in vane failures showed the failure to be a self-excited
   phenomenon and not driven by an external source of excitation. It was
   also shown that failures occur in vanes that are not rigidly fixed,
   validating the role of hub fixity in vane failures. Test results along
   with analysis confirm the role of time dependent hub fixity leading to
   the highly destructive flutter responsible for vane failures. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{We have analyzed very high frequency lightning mapping observations and
   remote magnetic field measurements to investigate connections between
   lightning morphology and impulse charge moment change (iCMC) of negative
   cloud-to-ground (CG) strokes with high estimated peak currents. Four
   lightning morphologies are identified for a total of 2126 strokes within
   optimum detection range of the North Alabama Lightning Mapping Array,
   and statistical iCMC distributions are given for each of these types.
   Almost all (>90\%) of the largest impulse charge moments (greater than
   -200 C km in this data set) are not produced by strokes in ordinary
   negative CG flashes. Instead, negative strokes with the largest iCMCs
   are almost exclusively associated with two unusual flash types that both
   initially develop as positive (normal) intracloud lightning. In the
   first type the negative stroke with high iCMCs results from a negative
   leader that descends from the midlevel negative charge region after the
   upper level negative leader ceases propagating. In the second type, the
   upper level negative leader of the intracloud lightning progresses
   toward ground as a so-called bolt from the blue to generate the negative
   stroke. Measurements of strokes associated with four negative polarity
   sprites suggest that all four were most likely produced in the first
   unusual lightning type. Our results highlight that estimated peak
   current and impulse charge transfer are not always well correlated and
   that the in-cloud lightning structure strongly influences charge
   transfer on short time scales in negative CG strokes.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the control of the optical and plasmonic properties of
   unique nanosystems-gold nanostars-both experimentally and theoretically
   permits superior design and fabrication for biomedical applications.
   Here, we present a new, surfactant-free synthesis method of
   biocompatible gold nanostars with adjustable geometry such that the
   plasmon band can be tuned into the near-infrared region `tissue
   diagnostic window', which is most suitable for in vivo imaging.
   Theoretical modelling was performed for multiple-branched 3D nanostars
   and yielded absorption spectra in good agreement with experimental
   results. The plasmon band shift was attributed to variations in branch
   aspect ratio, and the plasmon band intensifies with increasing branch
   number, branch length, and overall star size. Nanostars showed an
   extremely strong two-photon photoluminescence (TPL) process. The TPL
   imaging of wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) functionalized nanostars on BT549
   breast cancer cells and of PEGylated nanostars circulating in the
   vasculature, examined through a dorsal window chamber in vivo in
   laboratory mouse studies, demonstrated that gold nanostars can serve as
   an efficient contrast agent for biological imaging applications.}},

Title = {{Frontal Eye Field Neurons Assess Visual Stability Across Saccades}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2835-2845}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{The image on the retina may move because the eyes move, or because
   something in the visual scene moves. The brain is not fooled by this
   ambiguity. Even as we make saccades, we are able to detect whether
   visual objects remain stable or move. Here we test whether this ability
   to assess visual stability across saccades is present at the
   single-neuron level in the frontal eye field (FEF), an area that
   receives both visual input and information about imminent saccades. Our
   hypothesis was that neurons in the FEF report whether a visual stimulus
   remains stable or moves as a saccade is made. Monkeys made saccades in
   the presence of a visual stimulus outside of the receptive field. In
   some trials, the stimulus remained stable, but in other trials, it moved
   during the saccade. In every trial, the stimulus occupied the center of
   the receptive field after the saccade, thus evoking a reafferent visual
   response. We found that many FEF neurons signaled, in the strength and
   timing of their reafferent response, whether the stimulus had remained
   stable or moved. Reafferent responses were tuned for the amount of
   stimulus translation, and, in accordance with human psychophysics,
   tuning was better (more prevalent, stronger, and quicker) for stimuli
   that moved perpendicular, rather than parallel, to the saccade. Tuning
   was sometimes present as well for nonspatial transaccadic changes (in
   color, size, or both). Our results indicate that FEF neurons evaluate
   visual stability during saccades and may be general purpose detectors of
   transaccadic visual change.}},

Title = {{A phenomenological model for the flow resistance over submerged
   vegetation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{The bulk velocity Ub in streams is conventionally estimated from
   Manning's equation, but difficulties remain in parameterizing the
   roughness coefficient n when the streambed is covered with vegetation. A
   two-layer velocity model is proposed to determine n and Ub for the
   submerged vegetation case. The modeled n is derived as a function of
   flow and vegetation properties that can be inferred from remote sensing
   platforms, such as canopy height, leaf area density, and flow depth. The
   main novelty in the proposed formulation is that the shear stress is
   related to the mean velocity profile by considering both ejective and
   sweeping motions by dominant eddies. The proposed model is tested
   against a large data set from the literature and is shown to perform
   well, particularly for rigid vegetation. Poorer model performance for
   flexible vegetation can be partially attributed to the shape of the
   assumed mean velocity profile. The roughness coefficient n is found to
   be robust to variations in the average spacing between canopy elements,
   allowing the model to be applied to heterogeneous canopies.}},

Abstract = {{Here we document the effect of flow configuration on the heat transfer
   performance of a serpentine shaped stream embedded in a conducting
   solid. Several configurations with fixed volume of fluid are considered:
   U-shaped with varying spacing between the parallel portions of the U,
   serpentine shapes with three elbows, and conducting soil with several
   parallelepipedal shapes. We show that the spacing must be greater than a
   critical value in order for the heat transfer density of the
   stream-solid configuration to be the highest that it can be. Spacings
   larger than this critical value do not yield improvements in heat
   transfer density. We also show that even though the heat transfer is
   time dependent, the stream-solid configuration has an effective number
   of heat transfer units N-tu that is nearly constant in time. The larger
   N-tu values correspond to the configurations with greater heat transfer
   density. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{98-103}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{During biological reduction of trichloroethene (TCE), incomplete
   reduction to partially dechlorinated intermediates
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) can occur due
   to kinetic and inhibitory limitations. In this study, an anaerobic
   biotrickling filter was inoculated initially with a mixed culture
   containing Dehalococcoides spp. that contained the TceA and VcrA
   reductive dehalogenases. After significant accumulation of cis-DCE and
   VC was observed in the bioreactor effluent, it was hypothesized that
   bioaugmentation with Dehalococcoides strain BAV1, which contains the
   BvcA dehalogenase responsible for the metabolic dechlorination of
   cis-DCE and VC, would improve the conversion of TCE to ethene. It was
   found that at TCE loadings of 8-9 g m(bed)(-3) h(-1), bioaugmentation
   with strain BAV1 resulted in 45\% conversion of TCE to ethene, as
   opposed to less than 10\% prior to bioaugmentation. Strain BAV1 was
   found to grow to the same density (10(6)-10(7) cells per g of packing
   material) as Dehanlococcoides strains containing the TceA and VcrA
   dehalogenases. Strain BAV1 was also confirmed to be active, as
   determined by RT-qPCR of the BvcA mRNA. This study shows that it is
   possible to enhance the performance of continuously fed dechlorinating
   bioreactors by using a consortium that contains all three known
   reductive dehalogenases in the TCE dechlorination pathway. This is also
   the first study where a gas-phase biotrickling filter has been
   bioaugmented with a single strain to result in improved performance. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the response of an energy harvester that uses
   electromagnetic induction to convert ambient vibration into electrical
   energy. A unique aspect of the present study is the comparison of the
   system's response behavior when either a linear or a physically
   motivated form of nonlinear coupling is applied. The motivating
   hypothesis for this work was that nonlinear coupling could be used to
   improve the performance of an energy harvester by broadening its
   frequency response. Combined theoretical and numerical studies
   investigate the harvester's response for both single and multi-frequency
   base excitation. Our investigations unveil regions in the parameter
   space where nonlinear coupling is better than linear coupling and
   regions where the opposite is true. The meaningful conclusion is that
   nonlinear coupling can sometimes be detrimental, but it can also be
   beneficial if properly designed into the system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   for systems that may exhibit these phases and calculate order-disorder
   transition temperatureswhen they are predicted. High-throughput
   calculations predict L1(1) ground states in the systems Ag-Pd, Ag-Pt,
   Cu-Pt, Pd-Pt, Li-Pd, Li-Pt, and L1(3) ground states in the systems
   Cd-Pt, Cu-Pt, Pd-Pt, Li-Pd, Li-Pt. Cluster expansions confirm the
   appearance of these ground states in some cases. In the other cases,
   cluster expansion predicts unsuspected derivative superstructures as
   ground states. The order-disorder transition temperatures for all
   L1(1)/L1(3) ground states were found to be sufficiently high that their
   physical manifestation may be possible.}},

Abstract = {{The spin-polarization and magnetic coupling character of N-doped SrTiO3
   (STO) and BaTiO3 (BTO) are studied through first-principles
   calculations. The substitutional N doping at O sites leads to a
   half-metallic property and produces a magnetic moment of 1.0 mu(B). The
   magnetic interaction between the nearest and next-nearest N dopants
   results in a strong ferromagnetic (FM) coupling. When the distance
   between the N dopants is larger than 7 angstrom, the ground state of the
   system tends to be paramagnetic. A nitrogen-concentration threshold to
   produce the ferromagnetism is estimated. The calculated results give a
   good explanation for the experimentally observed ferromagnetism in
   N-doped STO and BTO. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to implement and evaluate the
   performance of a biplane correlation imaging (BCI) technique aimed to
   reduce the effect of anatomic noise and improve the detection of lung
   nodules in chest radiographs. Seventy-one low-dose posterior-anterior
   images were acquired from an anthropomorphic chest phantom with 0.28
   degrees angular separations over a range of +/-10 degrees along the
   vertical axis within an 11 s interval. Similar data were acquired from
   19 human subjects with institutional review board approval and informed
   consent. The data were incorporated into a computer-aided detection
   (CAD) algorithm in which suspect lesions were identified by examining
   the geometrical correlation of the detected signals that remained
   relatively constant against variable anatomic backgrounds. The data were
   analyzed to determine the effect of angular separation, and the overall
   sensitivity and false-positives for lung nodule detection. The best
   performance was achieved for angular separations of the projection pairs
   greater than 5 degrees. Within that range, the technique provided an
   order of magnitude decrease in the number of false-positive reports when
   compared with CAD analysis of single-view images. Overall, the technique
   yielded similar to 1.1 false-positive per patient with an average
   sensitivity of 75\%. The results indicated that the incorporation of
   angular information can offer a reduction in the number of
   false-positives without a notable reduction in sensitivity. The findings
   suggest that the BCI technique has the potential for clinical
   implementation as a cost-effective technique to improve the detection of
   subtle lung nodules with lowered rate of false-positives.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop an automated lung
   segmentation method for computerized detection of lung nodules in
   digital chest tomosynthesis.
   Methods: The authors collected 45 digital tomosynthesis scans and
   manually segmented reference lung regions in each scan to assess the
   performance of the method. The authors automated the technique by
   calculating the edge gradient in an original image for enhancing lung
   outline and transforming the edge gradient image to polar coordinate
   space. The authors then employed a dynamic programming technique to
   delineate outlines of the unobscured lungs in the transformed edge
   gradient image. The lung outlines were converted back to the original
   image to provide the final segmentation result. The above lung
   segmentation algorithm was first applied to the central reconstructed
   tomosynthesis slice because of the absence of ribs overlapping lung
   structures. The segmented lung in the central slice was then used to
   guide lung segmentation in noncentral slices. The authors evaluated the
   segmentation method by using (1) an overlap rate of lung regions, (2) a
   mean absolute distance (MAD) of lung borders, (3) a Hausdorff distance
   of lung borders between the automatically segmented lungs and manually
   segmented reference lungs, and (4) the fraction of nodules included in
   the automatically segmented lungs.
   Results: The segmentation method achieved mean overlap rates of 85.7\%,
   88.3\%, and 87.0\% for left lungs, right lungs, and entire lungs,
   respectively; mean MAD of 4.8, 3.9, and 4.4 mm for left lungs, right
   lungs, and entire lungs, respectively; and mean Hausdorrf distance of
   25.0 mm, 25.5 mm, and 30.1 mm for left lungs, right lungs, and entire
   lungs, respectively. All of the nodules inside the reference lungs were
   correctly included in the segmented lungs obtained with the lung
   segmentation method.
   Conclusions: The method achieved relatively high accuracy for lung
   segmentation and will be useful for computer-aided detection of lung
   nodules in digital tomosynthesis. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{Noble metal nanoparticles hold great potential as optical contrast
   agents due to a unique feature, known as the plasmon resonance, which
   produces enhanced scattering and absorption at specific frequencies. The
   plasmon resonance also provides a spectral tunability that is not often
   found in organic fluorophores or other labeling methods. The ability to
   functionalize these nanoparticles with antibodies has led to their
   development as contrast agents for molecular optical imaging. In this
   review article, we present methods for optimizing the spectral agility
   of these labels. We discuss synthesis of gold nanorods, a plasmonic
   nanoparticle in which the plasmonic resonance can be tuned during
   synthesis to provide imaging within the spectral window commonly
   utilized in biomedical applications. We describe recent advances in our
   group to functionalize gold and silver nanoparticles using distinct
   antibodies, including EGFR, HER-2 and IGF-1, selected for their
   relevance to tumor imaging. Finally, we present characterization of
   these nanoparticle labels to verify their spectral properties and

Abstract = {{As is known, zinc pollution has been a public environmental issue for a
   long time. Accordingly, the major objective of this study is to examine
   the effect of activated Firmiana simplex leaf on Zn(II) removal from
   aqueous solution. The result shows that activated Firmiana simplex leaf
   can remove Zn(II) effectively at 250 degrees C due to the preservation
   of amine, carboxyl, and phosphate groups. Several factors were
   determined to have significant effects on the adsorption of Zn(II),
   including the adsorbent component, dosage, initial concentration,
   solution pH, temperature, and duration. Pseudo first order and pseudo
   second order kinetics equations were used to predict the kinetic and
   thermodynamic constants that reveal the endothermic and spontaneous
   nature of the adsorption. Using the Langmuir model, the maximum zinc
   adsorption capacity was calculated to be 55.096 mg/g, which was
   subsequently confirmed by Fourier transformed infrared radiation (FT-IR)
   analyses and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. DOI:

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The widespread use of explosives by modern insurgents and
   terrorists has increased the potential frequency of blast exposure in
   soldiers and civilians. This growing threat highlights the importance of
   understanding and evaluating blast injury risk and the increase of
   injury risk from exposure to repeated blast effects.
   METHODS: Data from more than 3,250 large animal experiments were
   collected from studies focusing on the effects of blast exposure. The
   current study uses 2,349 experiments from the data collection for
   analysis of the primary blast injury and survival risk for both long-
   and short-duration blasts, including the effects from repeated
   exposures. A piecewise linear logistic regression was performed on the
   data to develop survival and injury risk assessment curves.
   RESULTS: New injury risk assessment curves uniting long- and
   short-duration blasts were developed for incident and reflected pressure
   measures and were used to evaluate the risk of injury based on blast
   overpressure, positive-phase duration, and the number of repeated
   exposures. The risk assessments were derived for three levels of injury
   severity: nonauditory, pulmonary, and fatality. The analysis showed a
   marked initial decrease in injury tolerance with each subsequent blast
   exposure. This effect decreases with increasing number of blast
   exposures.
   CONCLUSIONS: The new injury risk functions showed good agreement with
   the existing experimental data and provided a simplified model for
   primary blast injury risk. This model can be used to predict blast
   injury or fatality risk for single exposure and repeated exposure cases
   and has application in modern combat scenarios or in setting
   occupational health limits. (J Trauma. 2012; 72: 454-466. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The development of economical and highthroughput gene synthesis
   technology has been hampered by the high occurrence of errors in the
   synthesized products, which requires expensive labor and time to
   correct. Here, we describe an error correction reaction (ECR), which
   employs Surveyor, a mismatch-specific DNA endonuclease, to remove errors
   from synthetic genes. In ECR reactions, errors are revealed as
   mismatches by re-annealing of the synthetic gene products. Mismatches
   are recognized and excised by a combination of mismatch-specific
   endonuclease and 30'-> 50' exonuclease activities in the reaction
   mixture. Finally, overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (OE-PCR)
   re-assembles the resulting fragments into intact genes. The process can
   be iterated for increased fidelity. With two iterations, we were able to
   reduce errors in synthetic genes by >16-fold, yielding a final error
   rate of similar to 1 in 8700 bp.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00168.2011.-The adaptation of vascular endothelial
   cells to shear stress alteration induced by global hemodynamic changes,
   such as those accompanying exercise or digestion, is an essential
   component of normal endothelial physiology in vivo. An understanding of
   the transient regulation of endothelial phenotype during adaptation to
   changes in mural shear will advance our understanding of endothelial
   biology and may yield new insights into the mechanism of atherogenesis.
   In this study, we characterized the adaptive response of arterial
   endothelial cells to an acute increase in shear stress magnitude in
   well-defined in vitro settings. Porcine endothelial cells were
   preconditioned by a basal level shear stress of 15 +/- 15 dyn/cm(2) at 1
   Hz for 24 h, after which an acute increase in shear stress to 30 +/- 15
   dyn/cm(2) was applied. Endothelial permeability nearly doubled after
   40-min exposure to the elevated shear stress and then decreased
   gradually. Transcriptomics studies using microarray techniques
   identified 86 genes that were sensitive to the elevated shear. The acute
   increase in shear stress promoted the expression of a group of
   anti-inflammatory and antioxidative genes. The adaptive response of the
   global gene expression profile is triphasic, consisting of an induction
   period, an early adaptive response (ca. 45 min) and a late remodeling
   response. Our results suggest that endothelial cells exhibit a specific
   phenotype during the adaptive response to changes in shear stress; this
   phenotype is different than that of fully adapted endothelial cells.}},

Abstract = {{Neural agrin plays a pleiotropic role in skeletal muscle innervation and
   maturation, but its specific effects on the contractile function of
   aneural engineered muscle remain unknown. In this study, neonatal rat
   skeletal myoblasts cultured within 3-dimensional engineered muscle
   tissue constructs were treated with 10 nM soluble recombinant miniagrin
   and assessed using histological, biochemical, and functional assays.
   Depending on the treatment duration and onset time relative to the stage
   of myogenic differentiation, miniagrin was found to induce up to
   1.7-fold increase in twitch and tetanus force amplitude. This effect was
   associated with the 2.3-fold up-regulation of dystrophin gene expression
   at 6 d after agrin removal and enhanced ACh receptor (AChR) cluster
   formation, but no change in cell number, expression of muscle myosin, or
   important aspects of intracellular Ca2+ handling. In muscle constructs
   with endogenous ACh levels suppressed by the application of alpha-NETA,
   miniagrin increased AChR clustering and twitch force amplitude but
   failed to improve intracellular Ca2+ handling and increase
   tetanus-to-twitch ratio. Overall, our studies suggest that besides its
   synaptogenic function that could promote integration of engineered
   muscle constructs in vivo, neural agrin can directly promote the
   contractile function of aneural engineered muscle via mechanisms
   distinct from those involving endogenous ACh.-Bian, W., Bursac, N.

Title = {{The effects of gentle topographic variation on dispersal kernels of
   inertial particles}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Seed dispersal kernels of wind-dispersed species imprint the initial
   spatial template over which later demographic processes such as
   establishment or re-colonization operate from. A major knowledge gap in
   seed dispersal modeling by wind is the role of complex topography in
   modifying the kernel shape when referenced to the flat-world case. How
   complex topography modifies the dispersal kernels of inertial particles
   such as seeds is explored here via novel flume experiments. A train of
   gentle cosine hills and a canopy composed of densely arrayed rods with a
   roughness density resembling the leaf area density profile of hardwood
   species at maximum leaf area were used to represent a canopy-hill
   system. Spherical inertial particles having a coefficient of variation
   in terminal velocity commensurate with values reported from field
   studies were employed as model seeds. It was demonstrated that the seed
   dispersal kernel maintained its canonical `Wald' form as derived from
   simplified turbulent dispersion theories for flat terrain and vertically
   uniform flow field. Seeds released near the canopy top and from the top
   of the hill have a dispersal kernel mean distance that was about 35\%
   times larger than its counterpart for releases from the bottom of the
   hill. Moreover, the probability of occurrence of long-distance dispersal
   (LDD) events, defined here as seeds traversing a longitudinal distance
   exceeding 10 times the canopy height, were one order of magnitude larger
   for seeds released near the canopy top and from the hill top when
   compared to their counterpart released from the hill bottom. Citation:

Abstract = {{Elastomers and gels can be formed by interpenetrating two polymer
   networks on a molecular scale. This paper develops a theory to
   characterize the large deformation and damage of interpenetrating
   polymer networks. The theory integrates an interpenetrating network
   model with the network alteration theory. The interpenetration of one
   network stretches polymer chains in the other network and reduces its
   chain density, significantly affecting the initial modulus, stiffening
   and damage properties of the resultant elastomers and gels.
   Double-network hydrogels, a special type of interpenetrating polymer
   network, have demonstrated intriguing mechanical properties including
   high fracture toughness, Mullins effects, and necking instability. These
   properties have been qualitatively attributed to the damage of polymer
   networks. Using the theory, we quantitatively illustrate how the
   interplay between polymer-chain stiffening and damage-induced softening
   can cause the Mullins effect and necking instability. The theory is
   further implemented into a finite-element model to simulate the
   initiation and propagation of necking instability in double-network
   hydrogels. The theoretical and numerical results are compared with
   experimental data from multiple cyclic compressive and tensile tests.

Abstract = {{Frequency shift of gradient-echo MRI provides valuable information for
   assessing brain tissues. Recent studies suggest that the frequency and
   susceptibility contrast depend on white matter fiber orientation.
   However, the molecular underpinning of the orientation dependence is
   unclear. In this study, we investigated the orientation dependence of
   susceptibility of human brain in vivo and mouse brains ex vivo. The
   source of susceptibility anisotropy in white matter is likely to be
   myelin as evidenced by the loss of anisotropy in the dysmyelinating
   shiverer mouse brain. A biophysical model is developed to investigate
   the effect of the molecular susceptibility anisotropy of myelin
   components, especially myelin lipids, on the bulk anisotropy observed by
   MRI. This model provides a consistent interpretation of the orientation
   dependence of macroscopic magnetic susceptibility in normal mouse brain
   ex vivo and human brain in vivo and the microscopic origin of
   anisotropic susceptibility. It is predicted by the theoretical model and
   illustrated by the experimental data that the magnetic susceptibility of
   the white matter is least diamagnetic along the fiber direction. This
   relationship allows an efficient extraction of fiber orientation using
   susceptibility tensor imaging. These results suggest that anisotropy on
   the molecular level can be observed on the macroscopic level when the
   molecules are aligned in a highly ordered manner. Similar to the
   utilization of magnetic susceptibility anisotropy in elucidating
   molecular structures, imaging magnetic susceptibility anisotropy may
   also provide a useful tool for elucidating the microstructure of ordered
   biological tissues. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first computational study investigating the electric
   field (E-field) strength generated by various electroconvulsive therapy
   (ECT) electrode configurations in specific brain regions of interest
   (ROIs) that have putative roles in the therapeutic action and/or adverse
   side effects of ECT. This study also characterizes the impact of the
   white matter (WM) conductivity anisotropy on the E-field distribution. A
   finite element head model incorporating tissue heterogeneity and WM
   anisotropic conductivity was constructed based on structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor MRI data. We computed the
   spatial E-field distributions generated by three standard ECT electrode
   placements including bilateral (BL), bifrontal (BF), and right
   unilateral (RUL) and an investigational electrode configuration for
   focal electrically administered seizure therapy (FEAST). The key results
   are that (1) the median E-field strength over the whole brain is 3.9,
   1.5, 2.3, and 2.6 V/cm for the BL, BF, RUL, and FEAST electrode
   configurations, respectively, which coupled with the broad spread of the
   BL E-field suggests a biophysical basis for observations of superior
   efficacy of BL ECT compared to BF and RULED'; (2) in the hippocampi,
   BLECT produces a median E-field of 4.8 V/cm that is 1.5-2.8 times
   stronger than that for the other electrode configurations, consistent
   with the more pronounced amnestic effects of BL ECT; and (3) neglecting
   the WM conductivity anisotropy results in E-field strength error up to
   18\% overall and up to 39\% in specific ROIs, motivating the inclusion
   of the WM conductivity anisotropy in accurate head models. This
   computational study demonstrates how the realistic finite element head
   model incorporating tissue conductivity anisotropy provides quantitative
   insight into the biophysics of ECT, which may shed light on the
   differential clinical outcomes seen with various forms of ECT, and may
   guide the development of novel stimulation paradigms with improved
   risk/benefit ratio. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Structural and functional heterogeneities in cardiac tissue have
   been implicated in conduction block and arrhythmo-genesis. However, the
   propensity of specific sites within the heart to initiate conduction
   block has not been systematically explored. We utilized cardiomyocyte
   cultures replicating the realistic, magnetic resonance imaging-measured
   tissue boundaries and fibre directions of ventricular cross-sections to
   investigate their roles in the development of conduction block.
   Methods and results The Sprague-Dawley neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were
   micropatterned to obtain cultures with realistic ventricular tissue
   boundaries and either random or realistic fibre directions. Rapid pacing
   was applied at multiple sites, with action potential propagation
   optically mapped. Excitation either failed at the stimulus site or
   conduction block developed remotely, often initiating reentry. The
   incidence of conduction block in isotropic monolayers (0\% of cultures)
   increased with the inclusion of realistic tissue boundaries (17\%) and
   further with realistic fibre directions (34\%). Conduction block
   incidence was stimulus site-dependent and highest (77\%) with rapid
   pacing from the right ventricular (RV) free wall. Furthermore,
   conduction block occurred exclusively at the insertion of the RV free
   wall into the septum, where structure-mediated current source-load
   mismatches acutely reduced wavefront and waveback velocity. Tissue
   boundaries and sharp gradients in fibre direction uniquely determined
   the evolution, shape, and position of conduction block lines.
   Conclusion Our study suggests that specific micro-and macrostructural
   features of the ventricle determine the incidence and spatiotemporal
   characteristics of conduction block, independent of spatial
   heterogeneities in ion channel expression.}},

Abstract = {{The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes in
   digital microfluidic ``biochips{''} is an important cost-driver in the
   emerging market place, especially for disposable PCB devices that are
   being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However,
   most prior work on pin-constrained biochip design considers droplet
   routing and the assignment of pins to electrodes as independent
   problems. In this paper, we propose optimization methods to solve the
   droplet routing and pin-constrained design problems concurrently. First,
   we formulate the co-optimization problem involving droplet routing and
   pin-mapping. Next, we present an integer linear programming-based
   optimization method to solve the droplet-routing and the pin-mapping
   design problems concurrently. The proposed co-optimization method
   minimizes the number of control pins. We also present an efficient
   heuristic approach to tackle the co-optimization problem. These methods
   overcome a major drawback of a recently proposed method, which leads to
   infeasible solutions involving conflicts in the mapping of pins to
   electrodes in different droplet-routing stages. The effectiveness of the
   proposed co-optimization method is demonstrated for two commercial
   biochips and an experimental university chip for multiplexed in-vitro
   diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic significance of different
   descriptive parameters in head-and-neck cancer patients undergoing
   pretreatment {[}F-18] fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography
   (FDG-PET) imaging.
   Patients and Methods: Head-and-neck cancer patients who underwent
   FDG-PET before a course of curative intent radiotherapy were
   retrospectively analyzed. FDG-PET imaging parameters included maximum
   (SUV(max)), and mean (SUV(mean)) standard uptake values, and total
   lesion glycolysis (TLG). Tumors and lymph nodes were defined on
   co-registered axial computed tomography (CT) slices. SUV(max) and
   SUV(mean) were measured within these anatomic regions. The relationships
   between pretreatment SUV(max), SUV(mean) and TLG for the primary site
   and lymph nodes were assessed using a univariate analysis for
   disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional control (LRC), and distant
   metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were
   generated and compared via the log-rank method. SUV data were analyzed
   as continuous variables.
   Results: A total of 88 patients was assessed. Two-year OS, LRC, DMFS,
   and DFS for the entire cohort were 85\%, 78\%, 81\%, and 70\%,
   respectively. Median SUV(max) for the primary tumor and lymph nodes was
   15.4 and 12.2, respectively. Median SUV(mean) for the primary tumor and
   lymph nodes was 7 and 5.2, respectively. Median TLG was 770. Increasing
   pretreatment SUV(mean) can of the primary tumor was associated with
   decreased disease-free survival (p = 0.01). Neither SUV(max) in the
   primary tumor or lymph nodes nor TLG was prognostic for any of the
   clinical endpoints. Patients with pretreatment tumor SUV(mean) that
   exceeded the median value (7) of the cohort demonstrated inferior 2-year
   DFS relative to patients with SUV(mean) <= the median value of the
   cohort, 58\% vs. 82\%, respectively, p = 0.03.
   Conclusion: Increasing SUV(mean) in the primary tumor was associated
   with inferior DES. Although not routinely reported, pretreatment
   SUV(mean) may be a useful prognostic FDG-PET parameter and should be
   further evaluated prospectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effect of the contrast medium (CM)
   concentration and the saline chaser volume and injection rate on
   first-pass aortic enhancement characteristics in contrast-enhanced
   magnetic resonance angiography using a physiologic flow phantom.
   Materials and Methods: Imaging was performed on a 3.0-T magnetic
   resonance system (MAGNETOM Trio, Siemens Healthcare Solutions, Inc,
   Erlangen, Germany) using a 2-dimensional fast low angle shot T1-weighted
   sequence (repetition time, 500 milliseconds; echo time, 1.23
   milliseconds; flip angle, 8 degrees; 1 frame/s X 60 seconds). The
   following CM concentrations injected at 2 mL/s were used with 3
   different contrast agents (gadolinium {[}Gd]-BOPTA, Gd-HP-DO3A,
   Gd-DTPA): 20 mL of undiluted CM (100\%) and 80\%, 40\%, 20\%, 10\%, 5\%,
   and 2.5\% of the full amount, all diluted in saline to a volume of 20 mL
   to ensure equal bolus volume. The CM was followed by saline chasers of
   20 to 60 mL injected at 2 mL/s and 6 mL/s. Aortic signal intensity (SI)
   was measured, and normalized SI versus time (SI/T-n) curves were
   generated. The maximal SI (SImax), bolus length, and areas under the
   SI/T-n curve were calculated.
   Results: Decreasing the CM concentration from 100\% to 40\% resulted in
   a decrease of SImax to 86.1\% (mean). Further decreasing the CM
   concentration to 2.5\% decreased SImax to 5.1\% (mean). Altering the
   saline chaser volume had no significant effect on SImax. Increasing the
   saline chaser injection rate had little effect (mean increase, 2.2\%) on
   SImax when using >= 40\% of CM. There was a larger effect (mean
   increase, 19.6\%) when <= 20\% of CM were used. Bolus time length was
   significantly shorter (P < 0.001), and area under the SI/T-n curve was
   significantly smaller (P < 0.01) for the CM protocols followed by a
   saline chaser injected at 6 mL/s compared with a saline chaser injected
   at 2 mL/s.
   Conclusion: With 40\% of CM and a fast saline chaser, SImax close to
   that with undiluted CM can be achieved. An increased saline chaser
   injection rate has a more pronounced effect on aortic enhancement
   characteristics at lower CM concentrations than at higher CM
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse linear arrays provide better performance than the filled linear
   arrays in terms of direction estimation and resolution with reduced size
   and low cost. However, they are subject to manifold ambiguity. A method
   based on the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm to solve
   the manifold ambiguity of uncorrelated sources for sparse array is
   proposed in this paper. The method consists of two steps. The first step
   is to obtain all the directions of arrivals (DOAs), including true and
   spurious DOAs, using traditional MUSIC. The second step is to estimate
   the power values of the all DOAs by substituting all the DOAs to a cost
   function. The well-known Davidson Fletcher Powell (DFP) and Broyden
   Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (BFGS) algorithms are used to estimate the
   power values. The power values of spurious DOAs are very small or tend
   to zero compared with the values of the true DOAs. The true DOAs are
   then discriminated easily from the spurious DOAs with the power values.
   Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of
   the method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The purposes of this study are to present a general analysis for the
   failure of a buried steel pipeline and to apply the results to a case
   study. Energy methods and classical beam theory are employed to model
   the pipeline behavior under simultaneous tension and transverse loading,
   loadings that arise from pipeline undermining. The mathematical model is
   used to explain a case study in which a pipeline conveying natural gas
   to an apartment building was undermined by the collapse of an adjacent,
   unshored trench wall. The fact that the ground in the vicinity was water
   soaked from a broken water supply line exacerbated the sinking of the
   pipeline into the trench, a movement that broke the pipeline at a
   T-joint downstream from the trench. This failure led to a substantial
   gas explosion and fire in the apartment building, which resulted in five
   injuries and three fatalities of the residents. In this case study,
   postaccident forensic data provided by the National Transportation
   Safety Board (NTSB) were employed in a general analysis to explain the
   failure. These data include eye-witness accounts, an engineering survey
   map of the pipeline resting in the trench, photographs of the site and
   of the failed pipeline section, and tensile test and corrosion analysis
   reports for the pipeline steel. This study illustrates the importance of
   shoring the walls of trenches to avoid undermining and damaging adjacent
   buried pipelines. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{The marine copepod, Amphiascus tenuiremis (A. tenuiremis), is a well
   characterized invertebrate model for the screening and evaluation of
   endocrine and reproductive toxins using life-cycle assays. These tests
   evaluate phenotypic endpoints related to development and reproduction,
   which are utilized to predict population outcomes. Some of these
   endpoints in arthropods, including sexual maturation and molting, are
   controlled by the hormone ecdysone which acts through its cognate
   receptor, the ecdysone receptor. The purpose of this research was to
   obtain and characterize sequence information for the A. tenuiremis
   ecdysone receptor and investigate modulation of expression levels by
   fipronil, an insecticide that causes infertility in males and reduced
   egg extrusion in female copepods, and ponasterone, a natural ecdysone
   receptor agonist. Results show successful cloning and phylogenetic
   analysis of the ecdysone receptor for A. tenuiremis, providing the first
   genetic information for a hormone receptor in this species. Exposure of
   copepodites to fipronil for 1, 2, 4, 18 and 30 h caused a significant
   increase in ecdysone receptor transcriptional expression at 30 h
   compared to control unexposed animals. This work illustrates a potential
   mechanism whereby exposure to fipronil, and potentially other endocrine
   disrupting compounds, results in impacted reproduction. Furthermore,
   this exemplifies the potential utility of ecdysone receptor
   transcriptional measurement as a sensitive and rapid biomarker of
   ecological relevance when linked to traditional A. tenuiremis bioassays.

   channels of researchers interested in the idea, and slow and short,
   sideways from channels, by ``diffusion{''} to new users. The first
   regime accounts for the rising portion of the S curve, and the second
   for the slow-down. Tree-shaped established channels spread the idea
   faster than single channels over the same area. The complexity of the
   design of fast channels increases in time due to the evolution of

Abstract = {{Technetium, element 43, is the only radioactive transition metal. It
   occurs naturally on earth in only trace amounts. Experimental
   investigation of its possible compounds is thus inherently difficult and
   limited. Half of the Tc-transition-metal systems (14 out of 28) are
   reported to be phase separating or lack experimental data. Using
   high-throughput first-principles calculations, we present a
   comprehensive investigation of the binary alloys of technetium with the
   transition metals. The calculations predict stable, ordered structures
   in nine of these 14 binary systems. They also predict additional
   compounds in all nine known compound-forming systems and in two of the
   five systems reported with disordered chi or sigma phases. These results
   accentuate the incompleteness of the current knowledge of technetium
   alloys and should guide experimental studies to obtain accurate
   structural information on potential compounds, obviating some of the
   difficulties associated with such work.}},

Title = {{Relationship between sprite streamer behavior and lightning-driven
   electric fields}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{The lightning-driven electric fields not only initiate sprite streamers
   at high altitudes but also control their propagation to lower altitudes
   until termination. Thus, the relationship between sprite streamer
   behavior and their causative lightning-driven ambient electric field can
   reveal the internal microphysics during sprite development. In this
   work, we combined the measurements of broadband electromagnetic
   radiation from sprite-producing lightning, high-speed video of sprite
   optical emissions acquired at 5,000-10,000 frames per second, and
   numerical simulations to infer the background lightning-driven electric
   fields during the full extent of downward streamer propagation. For four
   sprites analyzed, all with positive polarity downward streamers, the
   observed streamers all terminate at locations where the ambient electric
   field is approximately 0.05 E-k, independent of the altitude where this
   field is reached. For two sprites with significant horizontal extent,
   the points of streamer termination closely follow the spatial contour of
   the E = 0.05 E-k surface, further confirming the consistency of this
   termination background field for positive sprite streamers. The positive
   streamers also begin their significant deceleration where the background
   field drops below 0.12-0.24 E-k. These measured termination field
   (E-ter) and deceleration field (E-dec) are consistent with previous
   laboratory experiments of positive streamer stopping field and critical
   field to sustain stable propagation. These results connect sprite
   streamer behavior with the lightning-driven background electric fields
   and can be a step to further constrain the existing model of streamer
   propagation in the mesosphere.}},

Title = {{Mechanism of Silver Nanoparticle Toxicity Is Dependent on Dissolved
   Silver and Surface Coating in Caenorhabditis elegans}},

Pages = {{1119-1127}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{The rapidly increasing use of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in consumer
   products and medical applications has raised ecological and human health
   concerns. A key question for addressing these concerns is whether Ag NP
   toxicity is mechanistically unique to nanoparticulate silver, or if it
   is a result of the release of silver ions. Furthermore, since Ag NPs are
   produced in a large variety of monomer sizes and coatings, and since
   their physicochemical behavior depends on the media composition, it is
   important to understand how these variables modulate toxicity. We found
   that a lower ionic strength medium resulted in greater toxicity
   (measured as growth inhibition) of all tested Ag NPs to Caenorhabditis
   elegans and that both dissolved silver and coating influenced Ag NP
   toxicity. We found a linear correlation between Ag NP toxicity and
   dissolved silver, but no correlation between size and toxicity. We used
   three independent and complementary approaches to investigate the
   mechanisms of toxicity of differentially coated and sized Ag NPs:
   pharmacological (rescue with trolox and N-acetylcysteine), genetic
   (analysis of metal-sensitive and oxidative stress-sensitive mutants),
   and physicochemical (including analysis of dissolution of Ag NPs).
   Oxidative dissolution was limited in our experimental conditions
   (maximally 15\% in 24 h) yet was key to the toxicity of most Ag NPs,
   highlighting a critical role for dissolved silver complexed with thiols
   in the toxicity of all tested Ag NPs. Some Ag NPs (typically less
   soluble due to size or coating) also acted via oxidative stress, an
   effect specific to nanoparticulate silver. However, in no case studied
   here was the toxicity of a Ag NP greater than would be predicted by
   complete dissolution of the same mass of silver as silver ions.}},

Abstract = {{Attaching functional molecules such as thiols and proteins to
   semiconductor surfaces is increasingly exploited in functional devices
   such as sensors. Despite extensive research to understand this interface
   and demonstrate a robust protocol for attachment, the bonding chemistry
   of thiolates to III-V surfaces has been under great debate in the
   literature. This study provides a comprehensive chemical model for the
   attachment of thiols to InAs, an increasingly device-relevant III-V
   semiconductor, using cysteamine as a model molecule. We examine the
   attachment of cysteamine to InAs via the thiol group using X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry and confirm
   that thiolate bonding to the substrate occurs preferentially to As sites
   over In sites as a limit These experiments explore the interplay of the
   native oxide chemical properties, the cysteamine concentration, and the
   evolving InAs surface chemistry with functionalization. The thiol-InAs
   interaction can be framed as a general acid-base reaction, where the
   nucleophilic and/or electrophilic attack of the surface (i.e., binding
   to In sites and/or As sites) depends on the acidity of the thiol. The
   roles of the initial oxide composition, the solvent of the
   functionalizing solution, and the cysteamine as a limiting reagent in
   fully displacing the oxide and creating In-S and As-S bonds are
   highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the chemistry and kinetics of the surface
   functionalization of InAs with hemin aimed at demonstrating novel
   hemin-functionalized InAs planar resistors or molecularly controlled
   resistors (MOCSERs) with subparts per billion sensitivity to NO at 300
   K. The high performance is a result of the strong coupling of the
   intrinsic surface-confined two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the
   InAs surface with the surface-attached hemin molecules and their
   selective interactions with NO. The presence of the surface 2DEG in InAs
   is highly advantageous for sensing and obviates the need for high
   surface area to volume geometries conferred by nanowire structures. The
   chemistry and kinetics of surface attachment processes are investigated
   using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and
   spectroscopic ellipsometry, showing that the covalent attachment of
   hemin to both In and As sites modifies the band-bending of the InAs. In
   addition, the selective, reversible electronic interaction between hemin
   and NO molecules increases the InAs resistance, reducing the NO during
   the interaction. In addition to presenting the sensor performance
   characteristics, a chemical model based on the electron transfer from
   the 2DEG of InAs to the iron center of hemin, which reduces Fe(III) to
   the higher NO affinity Fe(II) state, is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations of biomechanical properties of pediatric cadaver cervical
   spines subjected to tensile or bending modes of loading are generally
   limited by a lack of available tissue and limiting sample sizes, both
   per age and across age ranges. It is therefore important to develop
   fixation techniques capable of testing individual cadavers in multiple
   modes of loading to obtain more biomechanical data per subject. In this
   study, an experimental apparatus and fixation methodology was developed
   to accommodate cadaver osteoligamentous head-neck complexes from around
   birth (perinatal) to full maturation (adult) {[}cervical length:
   2.5-12.5 cm; head breadth: 6-15 cm; head length: 6-19 cm] and
   sequentially test the whole cervical spine in tension, the upper
   cervical spine in bending and the upper cervical spine in tension. The
   experimental apparatus and the fixation methodology provided a rigid
   casting of the head during testing and did not compromise the skull.
   Further testing of the intact skull and sub-cranial material was made
   available due to the design of the apparatus and fixation techniques
   utilized during spinal testing. The stiffness of the experimental
   apparatus and fixation technique are reported to better characterize the
   cervical spine stiffness data obtained from the apparatus. The apparatus
   and fixation technique stiffness was 1986 N/mm. This experimental system
   provides a stiff and consistent platform for biomechanical testing
   across a broad age range and under multiple modes of loading. (C) 2011

Title = {{The role of surface characteristics on intermittency and zero-crossing
   properties of atmospheric turbulence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Clustering and intermittency in atmospheric turbulent flows above
   different natural surfaces are investigated with reference to their
   dependency on surface roughness and thermal stratification. The dualism
   between active and quiescent phases within measured time series is
   isolated by using the telegraphic approximation (TA), which is able to
   eliminate the contributions to intermittency originating from amplitude
   variability associated with the energetic states. The presence of linear
   correlation relating the scaling exponents of energy spectra for the
   original series (n) and its TA counterpart (m) within the inertial
   sub-range (ISR) suggests that amplitude variability acts as a
   de-correlation factor for the series. Clustering exponents alpha
   estimated from velocity and scalar time series exhibit a weak dependence
   on the Taylor micro-scale Reynolds number (Re-lambda). The average
   values of intermittency exponents for the original (mu(s)) and the TA
   series (mu(TA)) are linearly correlated to alpha for longitudinal
   velocity and scalars. The derived relationships shows that in the
   atmospheric surface layer (ASL), amplitude intermittency plays a
   smoothing role on the clusterization of events. On the other hand,
   within the canopy sublayer (CSL) above canopies, scalars are more
   clustered and amplitude excursions tend to amplify (or not alter)
   clusterization. Moreover, reducing surface roughness results in a
   de-correlation between alpha and mu(TA) for the vertical velocity
   component. Additionally, the probability density functions of
   inter-pulse periods (I-p) were shown to be well approximated by the law
   p(I-p) similar to I-p(-gamma) for I-p within the ISR when gamma
   approximate to 3 - m, which also holds for sand pile models of self
   organized criticality in the large pile limit.}},

Abstract = {{Radiologic imaging is crucial in the diagnosis of skull fracture, but
   there is some doubt as to whether different imaging modalities can
   accurately identify fractures present on a human skull. While studies
   have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of radiologic imaging at
   other anatomical locations, there have been no systematic studies
   comparing various CT techniques, including high resolution imaging with
   and without 3D reconstructions to conventional radiologic imaging in
   children, we investigated which imaging modalities: high-resolution CT
   scan with 3D projections, clinical-resolution CT scans or X-rays, best
   showed fracture occurrence in a pediatric human cadaver skull by having
   an expert pediatric radiologist examine radiologic images from fractured
   skulls. The skulls used were taken from pediatric cadavers ranging in
   age from 5 months to 16 years. We evaluated the sensitivity and
   specificity for the imaging modalities using dissection findings as the
   gold standard. We found that high-resolution CT scans with 3D
   projections and conventional CT provided the most accurate fracture
   diagnosis (single-fracture sensitivity of 71\%) followed by X-rays
   (single-fracture sensitivity of 63\%). Linear fractures outsider the
   region of the sutures were more identifiable than diastatic fractures,
   though the incidence of false positives was greater for linear
   fractures. In the two cases where multiple fractures were present on the
   same anatomical skull location, the radiologist was less likely to
   identify the presence of additional fractures than a single fracture.
   Overall, the high-resolution and clinical-resolution CT scans had the
   similar accuracy for detecting skull fractures while the use of the
   X-ray was both less accurate and had a lower specificity. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{For decades ferroelectric thin films (FETFs) have been the focus of
   research and development for next-generation memory and semiconductor
   devices. FETFs are attractive because their polarization states are
   highly localized, stable, and switchable. These unique properties are
   also attractive for (bio)molecular sensing and separation applications.
   Polarization of both polymer and ceramic FETF results in the expression
   of a sustained high, non-Faradaic, surface charge density. If these
   surface charges are maintained in aqueous environments, then the
   resulting electrostatic forces should induce the formation of
   electrolyte gradients and aid in the localization of charged species to
   the surface. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the
   interfacial properties of FETFs, specifically how they interact with
   liquid or gaseous phases. Recent work has shown that the FETF
   polarization state affects adsorption from the gaseous phase, surface
   catalysis, and cell growth. Encouraged by these findings, the use of
   FETFs in aqueous environments is explored. After an introduction to
   FETFs, the growing body of literature on the FETF interface is reviewed,
   along with the limited number of studies demonstrating FETF function in
   gas and liquid environments. Finally, the exciting possibilities that
   FETFs could bring to interfacial engineering and lab-on-chip (LOC)
   device design is reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Neutron stimulated emission computed tomography (NSECT) is being
   developed as a non-invasive imaging modality to detect and quantify iron
   overload in the human liver. NSECT uses gamma photons emitted by the
   inelastic interaction between monochromatic fast neutrons and iron
   nuclei in the body to detect and quantify the disease. Previous
   simulated and physical experiments with phantoms have shown that NSECT
   has the potential to accurately diagnose iron overload with reasonable
   levels of radiation dose. In this work, we describe the results of a
   simulation study conducted to determine the sensitivity of the NSECT
   system for hepatic iron quantification in patients of different sizes. A
   GEANT4 simulation of the NSECT system was developed with a human liver
   and two torso sizes corresponding to small and large patients. The iron
   concentration in the liver ranged between 0.5 and 20 mg g(-1),(4)
   corresponding to clinically reported iron levels in iron-overloaded
   patients. High-purity germanium gamma detectors were simulated to detect
   the emitted gamma spectra, which were background corrected using
   suitable water phantoms and analyzed to determine the minimum detectable
   level (MDL) of iron and the sensitivity of the NSECT system. These
   analyses indicate that for a small patient (torso major axis = 30 cm)
   the MDL is 0.5 mg g(-1) and sensitivity is similar to 13 +/- 2 Fe
   counts/mg/mSv and for a large patient (torso major axis = 40 cm) the
   values are 1 mg g(-1) and similar to 5 +/- 1 Fe counts/mg/mSv,
   respectively. The results demonstrate that the MDL for both patient
   sizes lies within the clinically significant range for human iron
   overload.}},

Abstract = {{Gradient-echo MRI of resonance-frequency shift and T2{*} values exhibit
   unique tissue contrast and offer relevant physiological information.
   However, acquiring 3D-phase images and T2{*} maps with the standard
   spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequence is lengthy for routine imaging at
   high-spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage. In addition, with the
   standard SPGR sequence, optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cannot be
   achieved for every tissue type given their distributed resonance
   frequency and T2{*} value. To address these two issues, a SNR optimized
   multi-echo sequence with a stack-of-spiral acquisition is proposed and
   implemented for achieving fast and simultaneous acquisition of image
   phase and T2{*} maps. The analytical behavior of the phase SNR is
   derived as a function of resonance frequency, T2{*} and echo time. This
   relationship is utilized to achieve tissue optimized SNR by combining
   phase images with different echo times. Simulations and in vivo
   experiments were designed to verify the theoretical predictions. Using
   the multi-echo spiral acquisition, whole-brain coverage with 1 mm
   isotropic resolution can be achieved within 2.5 min, shortening the scan
   time by a factor of 8. The resulting multi-echo phase map shows similar
   SNR to that of the standard SPGR. The acquisition can be further
   accelerated with non-Cartesian parallel imaging. The technique can be
   readily extended to other multi-shot readout trajectories besides
   spiral. It may provide a practical acquisition strategy for high
   resolution and simultaneous 3D mapping of magnetic susceptibility and
   T2{*}. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of controlling networks of
   wireless mobile nodes to propagate information over large distances,
   while minimizing power consumption and maintaining desired Quality of
   Service (QoS) guarantees. For this, we rely on collaborative
   beamforming, where groups of nodes collaborate to adjust the initial
   phase of their transmitted signals to form a beam that focuses on the
   direction of a desired destination. This allows for transmission over
   large distances, minimizes multiuser interference and also provides
   significant power savings, which increases network longevity.
   Beamforming has been thoroughly studied in the networking literature in
   the context of stationary antennas. The contribution of this work is a
   novel framework that jointly optimizes the beamforming weights and node
   positions in networks of mobile beamformers. In particular, a hybrid
   control scheme is proposed, in which optimal beamforming is integrated
   with potential-field-based motion control, designed to optimize power
   consumption in the space of node positions, while ensuring QoS. The
   integrated system is shown to exhibit superior performance in terms of
   power savings compared to approaches that do not consider node mobility.
   This makes our approach very promising for further research and
   applications in mobile wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the asymptotic analysis of the subspace approach
   for vector ARMA process estimation. To overcome the statistical
   insufficiency of data, a new and straightforward LMI-based approach is
   proposed to obtain a positive real covariance model. Numerical results
   show this approach performs well even if the system poles are very close
   to the unit circle. Then, an explicit expression for the variance of the
   asymptotically normally distributed sample output covariance matrices
   and block-Hankel matrix are derived. From this result, together with
   perturbation techniques, several central limit theorems for the
   controllability matrix, observability matrix, and the state-space
   matrices of the associated covariance model are derived, as well as the
   norm bounds of Kalman gain and the innovations covariance matrix in the
   innovations model. By combining these asymptotic results, the H-2 norm
   bound of the error system, i.e. the difference between the identified
   transfer function and the true one, is derived with a given confidence
   level.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for optimal routing in
   wireless multi-hop networks. We build our approach on a recently
   proposed model for stochastic routing, whereby each node selects a
   neighbor to forward a packet according to a given probability
   distribution. Our solution relies on dual decomposition techniques with
   regularization, that can significantly improve on the slow convergence
   of subgradient methods. In particular, we employ the method of augmented
   Lagrangians (AL). While regularization introduces coupling of the primal
   variables, a recently proposed iterative approximation technique can be
   used to decouple the minimization problem in the augmented Lagrangian
   method (ALM). Once the approximation reaches a predetermined number of
   iterations it is terminated and followed by a novel update of the
   Lagrange multipliers, that differs from that in the standard ALM. We
   show that truncating the approximation is necessary to obtain a fully
   distributed approach, and that the proposed update of the Lagrange
   multipliers is critical to obtain convergence of our method. An
   additional advantage of our approach is that convergence is very fast
   even for sparse networks, where techniques that incorporate consensus
   iterations into the algorithm tend to be slow.}},

Abstract = {{In the prostate, ARFI and SWEI imaging methods have reported that cancer
   and other pathologies as being stiffer than the surrounding tissue. A
   three-dimensional in vivo prostatic imaging system capable of
   concurrently acquiring ARFI and SWEI data was developed to compare the
   information available in the two image types. Data were acquired in a
   calibrated CIRS phantom to analyze the contrast, contrast to noise ratio
   (CNR), and resolution between the ARFI and SWEI images; SWEI images
   provided improved contrast and CNR, but lower spatial resolution than
   ARFI images. Challenges and potential artifacts in both the ARFI and
   SWEI images have been identified and reduced by viewing coronal sections
   and maximum value SWEI images, resulting in high correlation between the
   normalized ARFI displacement magnitude and the estimated shear wave
   speed. We have demonstrated that this combined ARFI and SWEI imaging
   system can image the anatomy of the prostate.}},

   92\%, while color flow variance decreased by an average of 10\%. This

Abstract = {{Short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) imaging has recently been introduced
   as a clutter reducing imaging technique. Thus far, SLSC has been
   implemented solely on one-dimensional (1D) array transducers, and the
   present definition is not readily applicable to two-dimensional (2D)
   matrix array transducers. We propose a strategy based on the physics of
   pulse-echo ultrasound in diffuse scatterers. The method utilizes
   subaperture beamforming, wherein groups of N elements are
   delay-and-summed to form individual channels of output, and estimates
   the spatial coherence between subapertures.
   Our simulation results show that there is no noticeable degradation in
   the spatial coherence estimates associated with subaperture beamforming
   for small subaperture sizes; furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio is
   improved by a factor of root N. These results suggest that SLSC
   implementations on 2D matrix array transducers should employ subaperture
   beamforming.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound-based elasticity imaging methods, such as Acoustic Radiation
   Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging, rely upon the accurate estimation of
   displacements to characterize the mechanical response of soft tissues.
   Sources of clutter, such as off-axis scattering and reverberation, can
   corrupt displacement estimates and result in noisy images. In this work,
   we investigated the use of filter-based and pulse inversion harmonic
   tracking methods to monitor the displacements induced by an ARFI
   excitation. A fully sampled method was developed that improves the
   temporal sampling frequency associated with the pulse inversion
   technique. Implemented on a conventional scanner, the harmonic tracking
   methods are compared with conventional ARFI imaging techniques that use
   the fundamental component of the received beam in phantoms and in vivo.
   In phantoms, where the generated harmonics are minimal, the harmonic and
   fundamental methods provided similar results. Decreased jitter and
   improved feature detection in ARFI images were obtained with harmonic
   tracking methods in vivo.}},

   an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) transducer. Custom beam sequences
   were used to excite the myocardium with focused acoustic radiation force
   (ARF) impulses and image the subsequent tissue response. Tissue velocity
   in response to the ARF excitation was calculated with a phase-based
   estimator, and transverse wave velocity was estimated from a
   time-of-flight approach at each depth. The excitation sequence was
   repeated every 1/40 s for four seconds to generate 40 Hz M-Modes of
   induced Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) displacement magnitudes
   and Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) wave speeds. These images were
   taken from various views in the right and left ventricles, in and out of
   infarcted regions. Various views are presented and discussed. In all
   animals, ARFI and SWEI estimates indicated contraction and stiffness in
   non-infarcted tissues with high variance and no indications of
   remodeling in the diseased animals. Where available, views of infarcted
   tissue were compared to similar views from the control animal. In views
   of the LVFW, the infarcted tissue presented as stiff and non-contractile

Abstract = {{Recurrence of atrial fibrillation after transcatheter ablation (TCA) is
   common because there is no imaging modality that can visually confirm
   the presence of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) lesions. We have
   previously shown that acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging
   can visualize the relative tissue stiffness changes caused by RFA. The
   objective of this study was to determine if intra-procedurally acquired
   ARFI images could identify RFA lesions.
   In 8 canines, an integrated ARFI imaging-electroanatomical mapping (EAM)
   system was used to map the geometry of the right atrium and acquire ARFI
   images along an inter-caval line before and after RFA. RF-energy
   delivery sites were marked in the EAM geometry to guide the ARFI imaging
   plane to RFA lesion locations. The ARFI images were randomized and three
   separate reviewers read the images for the presence of RFA lesion. The
   majority assessment for each ARFI image was counted in a 2x2 contingency
   table according to the presence/absence of a RFA treatment marker in the
   EAM geometry at the ARFI imaging plane.
   EAM guided intra - procedure ARFI imaging of RFA treatment sites.
   Reviewers of the ARFI images identified RFA lesion with a high
   sensitivity (96.3\%) and specificity (93.2\%). Incorporating an
   integrated ARFI imaging-EAM system into TCA for the visualization of RFA
   lesions could potentially improve the procedure efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Endocardial border visualization, a common task in echochardiography, is
   typically challenged by the presence of acoustic clutter. This study
   investigates endocardial border visibility in co-registered fundamental
   and harmonic data when utilizing the Short-Lag Spatial Coherence (SLSC)
   beamformer, a clutter reduction approach that we developed. Individual
   channel echo data were acquired from the left ventricle of 12
   volunteers, after informed consent and IRB approval, to create matched
   image quadruplets of fundamental and harmonic B-mode and SLSC images.
   Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were measured, and three cardiologists
   rated the visibility of endocardial segments in randomly ordered cine
   loops. The statistical significance of visibility ratings was determined
   with a Holm-Bonferroni correction at a significance level, alpha = 0.05.
   CNR increased approximately two-fold in fundamental and harmonic SLSC
   images compared to fundamental and harmonic B-mode images. Fundamental
   and Harmonic SLSC imaging offered the greatest benefits when fundamental
   B-mode image quality was poor. Improvements in endocardial segment
   visibility in short-axis views ranged from 16-28\% (alpha = 0.05)
   compared to fundamental B-mode images, while improvements in the apical
   four chamber views ranged from 22-35\% (alpha = 0.05) compared to
   fundamental and harmonic B-mode images. Results suggest that SLSC and
   HSCI have the potential to increase endocardial border visualization and

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC)
   ultrasound imaging can provide improved SNR and CNR compared to
   conventional B-mode images, especially in the presence of noise and
   clutter. Application of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem predicts that
   coherence between the ultrasound echoes received across an array is
   reduced significantly away from the transmit focal depth, leading to a
   limited axial depth of eld in SLSC images. Transmit focus throughout
   the. eld of view can be achieved using synthetic aperture methods to
   combine multiple transmit events into a single nal image. We propose the
   application of these methods to create synthetically focused channel
   data to be used to create an SLSC image that will have an extended axial
   depth of. eld comparable to B-mode images. Experimental results in a
   phantom and in vivo are presented and compared to both B-mode images and
   dynamic receive focused SLSC images, demonstrating improved SNR and CNR
   away from the transmit focus and an enlarged axial depth of eld.}},

   used to examine the algorithm's performance for estimating
   displacements.
   The 2D simulations determined that a cap should be placed on the full

   better performance in all three dimensions, and the 3D in vivo results

Abstract = {{We identified and diagnosed hemochromatotic cases with an automatic
   technique based on peak recognition and chemometrics. Hemochromatosis is
   a disease characterized by an accumulation of iron in body organs.
   Neutron-stimulated emission computed tomography (NSECT) has demonstrated
   its ability to detect elevated iron concentrations in the liver through
   a non-invasive, low dose scan. Fast neutrons are used to generate
   gamma-ray emission from atomic nuclei in the liver, and the spectral
   energies of the emitted gamma photons are used to identify the elements
   of interest. The ability to analyze all gamma lines in the spectra,
   belonging either to an individual element or to different elements,
   significantly enhances the overall sensitivity, accuracy, and
   effectiveness of the diagnosis. We developed a novel
   peak-finding/peak-fitting algorithm, which rapidly processes all spectra
   collected on a large scale (i.e. all peaks within each spectrum in a set
   of spectra), and classifies the samples into healthy and diseased
   categories. The technique finds, deconvolves, and characterizes peaks
   based on their position, height, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and
   area, classifying the samples automatically with two methods,
   incriminant (novel) and discriminant analysis. We demonstrated that the
   algorithm classified a population of 64 healthy and 120 diseased
   simulated patients into healthy and hemochromatotic groups with
   clinically significant accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Normalization in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is essential to
   correct for sensitivity variation across detector elements and produce
   uniform images. Currently, the standard normalization protocol for
   General Electric (GE) systems requires a 20 minute scan of a 20 cm
   diameter cylindrical phantom filled with 2 mCi of F-18
   Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). This process calculates the single detector
   efficiency factors (epsilon) from the component based normalization
   factors (NF). We have investigated the feasibility of using smaller
   phantoms for normalization, including sensitivity to positioning and
   radioactivity concentration. Four new test phantoms were used for
   normalization on a GE Discovery 690 PET/CT scanner. The test phantoms
   included 4.5 cm, 7.5 cm and 10cm diameter cylinders, and a 16-20 cm
   diameter cylindrical shell. Normalization scans were also taken using
   the 7.5 cm and 10 cm cylinder phantoms over a range of FDG activities
   and at transaxially off-center positions. Image quality was assessed by
   reconstructing a 4 hr high count, uniform activity image quality (IQ)
   phantom scan using each normalization data set. All test phantoms
   produced similarly uniform reconstructions of the IQ phantom scan. Upon
   examining subtractions from the standard, high frequency ring artifacts
   with +/- 1\% peak intensity were present in images reconstructed using
   the 4.5cm, 7.5cm, and 10cm normalization phantoms. FFT analysis
   quantified the spatial period of ring artifacts as T = 2.15 +/- 0.1 cm,
   one half of the detector block width of the GE 690 system. Simulation
   confirmed that ring artifacts result from periodic detector sensitivity
   decrease, which points to incident photo obliquity being the cause of
   said artifact. ROIs across anterior/posterior direction of the central
   slice were used to quantify low frequency uniformity. Low frequency
   non-uniformities were found to be produced by off-center normalization
   phantom positioning, as expected. In addition, an 8 minute Hoffman brain
   phantom scan was reconstructed using each a centered normalization data
   set from each phantom. Grey matter was isolated and statistically
   assessed using mean and max intensity difference from the standard. When
   subtracted from the standard reconstruction, all four test phantom
   images displayed similar to 0.5\% standard deviation of pixel intensity
   variation, which did not create a visibly noticeable difference in the
   reconstructed images.}},

Abstract = {{Image keypoints are widely used in computer vision for object matching
   and recognition, where they provide the best solution for matching and
   instance recognition of complex objects within cluttered images. Most
   matching algorithms operate by first finding interest points, or
   keypoints, that are expected to be common across multiple views of the
   same object. A small area, or patch, around each keypoint can be
   represented by a numerical descriptor that describes the structure of
   the patch. By matching descriptors from keypoints found in 2-D data to
   keypoints of known origin, matching algorithms can determine the
   likelihood that any particular patch matches a pre-existing template.
   The objective in this research is to apply these methods to
   two-dimensional slices of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data in order
   to distinguish between landmine and non-landmine responses. In this
   work, a variety of established object matching algorithms have been
   tested and evaluated to examine their application to GPR data. In
   addition, GPR specific keypoint and descriptor methods have been
   developed which better suit the landmine detection task within GPR data.
   These methods improve on the performance of standard image processing
   techniques, and show promise for future work involving translations of
   technologies from the computer vision field to landmine detection in GPR
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The horizontal and vertical motions of a spherical buoy, excited by
   synthetic ocean waves within a wave flume, is numerically and
   experimentally investigated. First, fluid motion in the wave tank is
   described using Airy's theory, and the forces on the buoy are determined
   using a modified form of Morison's equation. The system is then studied
   statically in order to determine the effects of varying system
   parameters. Numerical simulations then use the governing equations to
   compare predicted motions with experimentally observed behavior.}},

   theorem. The potential energy of the system is given for two regions

   diagram is obtained showing the stability of the upright and tilt angle
   equilibria as function of both the fluid height in the container and the
   pivot location. In particular, it is shown that the upright angle
   equilibrium undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation and it is also found that

Abstract = {{Many effective buried threat detection systems rely on close proximity
   and near vertical deployment over subsurface objects before reasonable
   performance can be obtained. A forward-looking sensor configuration,
   where an object can be detected from much greater distances, allows for
   safer detection of buried explosive threats, and increased rates of
   advance. Forward-looking configurations also provide an additional
   advantage of yielding multiple perspectives and looks at each subsurface
   area, and data from these multiple pose angles can be potentially
   exploited for improved detection. This work investigates several aspects
   of detection algorithms that can be applied to forward-looking imagery.
   Previous forward-looking detection algorithms have employed several
   anomaly detection algorithms, such as the RX algorithm. In this work the
   performance of the RX algorithm is compared to a scale-space approach
   based on Laplcaian of Gaussian filtering. This work also investigates
   methods to combine the detection output from successive frames to aid
   detection performance. This is done by exploiting the spatial colocation
   of detection alarms after they are mapped from image coordinates into
   world coordinates. The performance of the resulting algorithms are
   measured on data from a forward-looking vehicle mounted optical sensor
   system collected over several lanes at a western U. S. test facility.
   Results indicate that exploiting the spatial colocation of detections
   made in successive frames can yield improved performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate optimal intermittent feedback for nonlinear

   plant, we develop a methodology that outputs when to update the
   controller with new measurements such that a given cost function is
   minimized. Our cost function captures trade-offs between the performance
   and energy consumption of the control system. The optimization problem
   is formulated as a Dynamic Programming problem, and Approximate Dynamic
   Programming is employed to solve it. Instead of advocating a particular
   approximation architecture for Approximate Dynamic Programming, we
   formulate properties that successful approximation architectures
   satisfy. In addition, we consider problems with partially observable
   states, and propose Particle Filtering to deal with partially observable
   states and intermittent feedback. Finally, our approach is applied to a
   mobile robot trajectory tracking problem.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear harmonic balance method for the simulation of turbomachinery
   flows is presented. The method is based on representing an unsteady,
   time periodic flow by a Fourier series in time and then solving a set of
   mathematically steady-state equations to obtain the Fourier
   coefficients. The steady-state solutions are stored at discrete time
   levels distributed throughout one period of unsteadiness and are coupled
   via the physical time derivative and at periodic boundaries. Implicit
   coupling between time levels is achieved in a computationally efficient
   manner through approximate factorization of the linear system that
   results from the discretized equations.
   Unsteady, rotor-stator interactions are performed to validate the
   implementation. Results based on the harmonic balance method are
   compared against those obtained using a full unsteady, time-accurate
   calculation using moving meshes. The implicitly coupled nonlinear
   harmonic balance method is shown to produce a solution of reasonable
   accuracy compared to the full unsteady approach but with significantly
   less computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel score detector for temporal spectrum opportunity
   detection in cognitive radio by exploiting the differences in both
   energy and correlation of the empty band and the occupied band.
   Motivated by the challenge of detecting a weak primary user's signal
   without precise knowledge of the signal, where the conventional energy
   detector faces the limit of ``SNR wall{''}, we assume a simple model
   which captures a key difference between noise and primary user's signal
   - their correlation structures. Besides the merit of incorporating
   signal correlation, our score detector also avoids the computational
   complexity of covariance matrix inversion incurred by the corresponding
   maximum likelihood statistic assuming signal correlation. We provide a
   theoretical approximation to the false-alarm-rate of the score detector,
   which can be used to determine the threshold efficiently. We demonstrate
   that our approximation is quite accurate, and that our score detector
   has an advantage when the signal is weak and correlated.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient spectrum sensing is an important problem given the large and
   increasing demand for wireless spectrum and the need to protect
   incumbent users. We can more efficiently use large swaths of
   underutilized spectrum by designing spectrum sensors that can quickly,
   and power-efficiently, find and opportunistically communicate over
   unused (or underutilized) pieces of spectrum, such as television bands.
   In this paper, we concentrate on a particular sensing architecture, the
   Random Demodulator (RD), and look at two aspects of the problem. First,
   we offer fundamental limits on how efficiently any algorithm can perform
   the sensing operation with the RD. Second, we analyze a very simple,
   low-complexity algorithm called one-step thresholding that has been
   shown to work near-optimally for certain measurement classes in a low
   SNR setting or when the non-zero input coefficients are nearly equal. We
   rigorously establish that the RD architecture is well-suited for
   near-optimal recovery of the locations of the non-zero frequency
   coefficients in similar settings using one-step thresholding and perform
   numerical experiments to offer some confirmation of our results.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},

Pages = {{181-192}},
Abstract = {{Significant gaps exist in our understanding of early sea turtle life
   stages. Dispersal and habitat use of young oceanic sea turtles are
   largely inferred. Historically, available tracking technology and tag
   attachment methods were limited by small body sizes and rapid growth of
   neonate sea turtles. We tested methods in the laboratory for attaching
   small solar-powered satellite tags to neonate loggerhead sea turtles
   Caretta caretta, including harnesses, hard epoxy and neoprene-silicone
   mounts. Non-harness attachments were tested on turtles with clean
   carapaces and carapaces treated with an acrylic base-coat. Turtle growth
   and condition were measured among treatment and control groups. We
   tested surrogate solar cells, coated with clear silicone antifoulant for
   biofouling and performance, and field tested the performance of 7
   solar-powered satellite tags on neonate loggerheads released off
   southeastern Florida (USA). Attachments with acrylic base-coats remained
   affixed 4- to 8-fold longer than on untreated carapaces. Harness
   attachments resulted in long-term tag retention (>60 d). However,
   harness and hard epoxy attachments did not adjust for turtle growth; we
   do not recommend these methods for rapidly growing neonate turtles. The
   method with longest retention was a neoprene-silicone attachment on an
   acrylic base-coat. Growth and condition were comparable among treated
   and control turtles using this flexible neoprene-silicone-acrylic
   attachment. Field-tested tags transmitted for 38 to 172 d. There were
   significant differences in charge rates of tags treated with an
   antifoulant and untreated tags; however, all tags charged optimally and
   transmitted high-quality locations. Our data suggest that small
   solar-powered tags are viable tools for monitoring the in-water behavior
   of oceanic sea turtles.}},

Abstract = {{Data backup operation is an essential part of common IT system
   administration to protect against data loss caused by any storage
   failures, human errors, or disasters. Lost data can be recovered from
   the backed up data if it exists. Since the backup and restore operations
   accrue downtime overhead or performance degradation, they have to be
   designed to ensure the data reliability while minimizing the performance
   and availability overhead. In this paper, we study the impacts of
   different backup policies on availability measures such as storage
   availability, system availability, and user-perceived availability.
   Backup and restore operations are designed using SysML Activity diagrams
   that are automatically translated into Stochastic Reward Net (SRN) to
   compute the availability measures. Our numerical results show the
   effectiveness of the combination of full backup and partial backup in
   terms of user-perceived data availability and data loss rate.
   Furthermore, the sensitivity ranking can help improve the availability
   measures.}},

   The cyberphysical biochip system studied thus far suffers from the
   limitation of a significant increase in reaction time for error
   recovery. We present a hardware-assisted error-recovery method that
   relies on an error dictionary for rapid error recovery. The
   error-recovery procedure and dynamic resynthesis of a reaction, which is
   especially attractive for flash chemistry, can be implemented in
   real-time on a single-board microcontroller. In order to store the error
   dictionary in the limited memory available in the low-cost
   microcontroller, we describe two compaction techniques. We use three
   laboratorial protocols to demonstrate that, compared to software-based
   methods, the proposed dictionary-based error-recovery method has less
   impact on response time, and requires simple experimental setup, and
   only a small amount of memory.}},

   has demonstrated success in both optical imaging and photothermal
   ablation of cancer. Methods by which each particle can be conjugated to

Abstract = {{Pre-bond testing of TSVs and die logic is a significant challenge and a
   potential roadblock for 3D integration. BIST solutions introduce
   considerable die area overhead. Oversized probe pads on TSVs to provide
   pre-bond test access limit both test bandwidth and TSV density. This
   paper presents a solution to these problems, allowing a probe card to
   contact TSVs without the need for probe pads, enabling both TSV and
   pre-bond scan test. Two possible pre-bond scan test configurations are
   shown-they provide varying degrees of test parallelism. HSPICE
   simulations are performed on a logic-on-logic 3D benchmark. Results show
   that the ratio of the number of probe needles available for test access
   to the number of pre-bond scan chains determines which pre-bond scan
   configuration results in the shortest test time. Maximum pre-bond
   scan-in and scan-out shift-clock speeds are determined for dies in a
   benchmark 3D design. These clock speeds show that pre-bond scan test can
   be performed quickly, at a speed that is comparable to scan testing of
   packaged dies. The maximum clock speed can also be tuned by changing the
   drive strength of the probe and on-die drivers of the TSV network.
   Estimates are also provided for peak and average power consumption
   during pre-bond scan test. On-die area overhead for the proposed method
   is estimated to be between 1.0\% and 2.2\% for three dies in the 3D
   stack.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new system for measuring ambient RF energy in the 2.4GHz
   ISM band. This apparatus is intended to establish the feasibility of
   harvesting ambient RF energy to power emerging ultra-low-power sensors
   and microcontrollers. We simultaneously acquire RF measurements from a
   spatial and polarization diversity antenna system, with both a spectrum
   analyzer (frequency-selective but slow), and a log amp (wideband but
   fast), explain key tradeoffs in the measurement configuration, and
   present a post-processing algorithm which provides a reliable
   characterization of the RF energy available in the 2.4GHz ISM band.
   Preliminary results suggest enough energy is available to support a low
   duty cycle wireless sensor node system. An average RF power of 11nW is
   observed 10m away from a typical Wi-Fi access point in an office
   environment, suggesting the possibility of low duty cycle, wirelessly
   powered sensing and communication using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or
   another ultra low power uplink.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a towed-array shape estimation technique that
   exploits the directional structure of the time-varying acoustic field.
   Unlike conventional array shape estimation methods that use discrete
   sources of opportunity, the proposed approach does not assume knowledge
   of the number of sources in the field or their estimated directions.
   Instead, the entire time-varying field directionality map is used.
   Additionally, maneuverability of the array is exploited to improve
   endfire resolution and left/right discrimination for a nominally linear
   array. The algorithm forms an approximate joint maximum-likelihood
   estimate of time-varying field directionality and array shape using an
   iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach. Simulations are given
   to evaluate the array shape estimation error during a maneuver. In a
   simulated multi-source scenario, the proposed method is shown to be more
   robust than methods that rely on direction-of-arrival estimation when
   the full field around the array is considered.}},

Abstract = {{We study the various physical processes and their timescales involved in
   the excitation of wakefields in relativistically hot plasma. This has
   relevance to the design of a high repetition-rate plasma wakefield
   collider in which the plasma has not had time to cool between bunches in
   addition to understanding the physics of cosmic jets in relativistically
   hot astrophysical plasmas. When the plasma is relativistically hot
   (plasma temperature near m(e)c(2)), the thermal pressure competes with
   the restoring force of ion space charge and can reduce or even eliminate
   the accelerating field of a wake. We will investigate explicitly the
   case where the hot plasma is created by a preceding Wakefield drive
   bunch 10's of picoseconds to many nanoseconds ahead of the next drive
   bunch. The relativistically hot plasma is created when the excess energy
   (not coupled to the driven e(-) bunch) in the wake driven by the drive
   e-bunch is eventually converted into thermal energy on 10's of
   picosecond timescale. We will investigate the thermalization and
   diffusion processes of this non-equilibrium plasma on longer time
   scales, including the effects of ambi-polar diffusion of ions driven by
   hot electron expansion, possible Columbic explosion of ions producing
   higher ionization states and ionization of surrounding neutral atoms via
   collisions with hot electrons. Preliminary results of the transverse and
   longitudinal wakefields at different timescales of separation between a
   first and second bunch are presented and a possible experiment to study
   this topic at the FACET facility is described.}},

Abstract = {{The early detection of developmental disorders is key to child outcome,
   allowing interventions to be initiated that promote development and
   improve prognosis. Research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests
   behavioral markers can be observed late in the first year of life. Many
   of these studies involved extensive frame-by-frame video observation and
   analysis of a child's natural behavior. Although non-intrusive, these
   methods are extremely time-intensive and require a high level of
   observer training; thus, they are impractical for clinical purposes.
   Diagnostic measures for ASD are available for infants but are only
   accurate when used by specialists experienced in early diagnosis. This
   work is a first milestone in a long-term multidisciplinary project that
   aims at helping clinicians and general practitioners accomplish this
   early detection/measurement task automatically. We focus on providing
   computer vision tools to measure and identify ASD behavioral markers
   based on components of the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI).
   In particular, we develop algorithms to measure three critical AOSI
   activities that assess visual attention. We augment these AOSI
   activities with an additional test that analyzes asymmetrical patterns
   in unsupported gait. The first set of algorithms involves assessing head
   motion by facial feature tracking, while the gait analysis relies on
   joint foreground segmentation and 2D body pose estimation in video. We
   show results that provide insightful knowledge to augment the
   clinician's behavioral observations obtained from real in-clinic
   assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of buried explosive threats is a challenging problem. GPR has
   recently become a powerful tool for achieving robust subsurface target
   detection, but novel target types, and large numbers of subsurface
   objects in rural environments significantly complicate accurate
   discrimination of explosive threats from harmless false alarms.
   Significant research in feature extraction from GPR data has previously
   shown the capability for improved performance. Similarly, many
   techniques from the computer vision literature have made significant
   strides in recent years in for improvements in object class recognition.
   This work studies the relationships between and application of feature
   descriptor techniques from the computer vision community in application
   to target detection in GPR data. Relationships between a very successful
   computer vision technique (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and a
   related powerful technique from subsurface sensing (Edge Histogram
   Descriptors) are explored, and preliminary results suggest that
   techniques from the computer vision literature may provide robust target
   detection performance in GPR.}},

Abstract = {{Clutter, a problematic noise artifact in echocardiography, appears as a
   diffuse haze that obscures endocardial borders and inhibits accurate
   diagnoses. Several approaches are available to reduce clutter in cardiac
   images, yet difficult-to-image patients still exist. We have recently
   developed a novel imaging method, termed short-lag spatial coherence
   (SLSC) imaging, that has demonstrated potential to reduce clutter in
   simulated and experimental data. With this technique, images are created
   from the same individual channel signals used to form B-mode images, but
   instead of applying a conventional delay-and-sum beamformer, the data
   are cross-correlated to measure and display differences in spatial
   coherence. This technique was applied to in vivo cardiac images.
   Individual channel signals were acquired to form matched B-mode and SLSC
   images of the left ventricle in fourteen human volunteers. The contrast
   and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the ventricle and the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the endocardium were measured in the same
   locations in matched B-mode and SLSC images. In SLSC images created with
   a short-lag value equivalent to 16\% of the transmit aperture, contrast
   and CNR was improved by 9+/-7 dB and 0.4+/-0.2, respectively, in the
   SLSC images. The average SNR of the endocardium was 1.7+/-0.4 in the
   SLSC images and 1.8+/-0.4 in the B-mode images. The presented approach
   demonstrates a new method for reducing clutter in cardiac images.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional spectrometers are limited in the amount of light they
   accept because of the requirement for narrow input apertures. A
   trade-off must generally be made between spectral resolution and input
   aperture width. This is especially a problem for performing spectroscopy
   on diffuse sources, such as with tissue, from which signal light has a
   broad spatial distribution. We introduce a method for achieving good
   spectral resolution from a fiber bundle input. The image of a fiber
   bundle has a characteristic structure. By distorting this image
   optically, we generate a pseudo-orthogonal intensity mask at the input
   of the spectrometer. The pseudo-orthogonal properties of the mask then
   allow decoupling at the detector plane of wavelength from spatial
   position. As long as the distorted image of the fiber bundle is well
   known, a spectrum can be recovered with spectral resolution equivalent
   to that of a conventional slit-based spectrometer. We demonstrate
   successful recovery of narrowly spaced spectral features as well as
   Raman spectra from a highly scattering sample with this method. This
   method enables probes with much higher throughputs and add fiber
   bundle-based spectroscopy to endoscopic designs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is motivated by the challenge of high fidelity processing of
   images using a relatively small set of projection measurements. This is
   a problem of great interest in many sensing applications, for example
   where high photodetector counts are precluded by a combination of
   available power, form factor and expense. The emerging methods of
   dictionary learning and compressive sensing offer great potential for
   addressing this challenge. Combining these methods requires that the
   signals of interest be representable as a sparse combination of elements
   of some dictionary. This paper develops a method that aligns the
   discriminative power of such a dictionary with the physical limitations
   of the imaging system. Alignment is accomplished by designing a
   projection matrix that exposes and then aligns the modes of the noise
   with those of the dictionary. The design algorithm is obtained by
   modifying an algorithm for designing the pre-filter to maximize the rate
   and reliability of a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)
   communications channel. The difference is that in the communications
   problem a source is being matched to a channel, whereas in the imaging
   problem a channel, or equivalently the noise covariance, is being
   matched to a source.
   Our results shown that using the proposed communications design
   framework we can reduce reconstruction error between 20\%, after only 20
   projections of a 28 x 28 image, and 10\% after 100 projections.
   Furthermore, we noticeably see the superior quality of the reconstructed
   images.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a method of detecting the range and Doppler
   phase of a point target using multiple antennas. As a key illustrative
   example, we consider a 4 x 4 system employing a unitary matrix waveform
   set, e.g., formed from Golay complementary sequences. When a
   non-negligible Doppler shift is induced by the target motion, the
   waveform matrix formed from the complementary sequences is no longer
   unitary, resulting in significantly degraded target range estimates. To
   solve this problem, we adopt a subspace based approach exploiting the
   observation that the receive matrix formed from matched filtering of the
   reflected waveforms has a (non-trivial) null-space. Through processing
   of the waveforms with the appropriate vector from the null-space, we can
   significantly improve the range detection performance. Also, another
   very important target aspect is the velocity with which the target is
   moving, and to determine that, the exact Doppler phase shift induced by
   the target motion needs to be estimated with reasonable accuracy. To
   accomplish this task, we develop a strategy that uses the MUSIC
   algorithm to estimate the Doppler phase, and we use simulations to show
   that the phase estimates obtained are reasonably accurate even at low
   SNRs.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of reconstructing a data stream from a small
   subset of its entries, where the data stream is assumed to lie in a
   low-dimensional linear subspace, possibly corrupted by noise. It is also
   important to track the change of underlying subspace for many
   applications. This problem can be viewed as a sequential low-rank matrix
   completion problem in which the subspace is learned in an online
   fashion. The proposed algorithm, called Parallel Estimation and Tracking
   by REcursive Least Squares (PETRELS), identifies the underlying
   low-dimensional subspace via a recursive procedure for each row of the
   subspace matrix in parallel, and then reconstructs the missing entries
   via least-squares estimation if required. PETRELS outperforms previous
   approaches by discounting observations in order to capture long-term
   behavior of the data stream and be able to adapt to it. Numerical
   examples are provided for direction-of-arrival estimation and matrix
   completion, comparing PETRELS with state of the art batch algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In many biochemical protocols, solution preparation is a preprocessing
   step for mixing two or more fluids in a given ratio. Dilution of a
   biochemical sample/reagent is the special case of mixing or solution
   preparation where only two different type of fluids, one of which is a
   buffer solution, are mixed at a certain ratio corresponding to the
   desired concentration factor. Bioassays implemented on digital
   microfluidic biochips may require several different concentration values
   of the same sample/reagent. In this paper, we present a scheme in which
   a set of different target droplets (with concentration values ranged
   between 0\% and 100\%) can be produced with an acceptable error bound in
   minimum mix-split steps. The method does not require any intermediate
   storage since, at each step, the current droplet is mixed only with the
   sample (with 100\% concentration) or with the buffer (with 0\%
   concentration) droplet. The problem of generating multiple target
   concentrations has been formulated based on a binary de Bruijn graph.
   The proposed technique outperforms the existing single target based
   methods in terms of both the number of mix-split steps and the number of
   waste droplets. This in turn, reduces the execution time, the number of
   electrode actuations, and sample/reagent requirement. A digital
   microfluidic platform can also be easily designed to implement such
   on-chip sample preparation.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on quantifying the effect of intrinsic (thermal) noise
   and parametric uncertainty in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We
   consider isothermal, isobaric MD simulations of TIP4P (or four-site)
   water at ambient conditions, T = 298 K and P = 1 atm. Parametric
   uncertainty is assumed to originate from three force-field parameters
   that are parametrized in terms of standard uniform random variables. The
   thermal fluctuations inherent in MD simulations combine with parametric
   uncertainty to yield nondeterministic, noisy MD predictions of bulk
   water properties. Relying on polynomial chaos (PC) expansions, we
   develop a framework that enables us to isolate the impact of parametric
   uncertainty on the MD predictions and control the effect of the
   intrinsic noise. We construct the PC representations of quantities of
   interest (QoIs) using two different approaches: nonintrusive spectral
   projection (NISP) and Bayesian inference. We verify a priori the
   legitimacy of the NISP approach by verifying that the MD data satisfy
   regularity and smoothness conditions in the parameter space. The
   Bayesian inference approach relies on adaptively sampling the parameter
   space, based on analyzing the convergence of the PC expansions at
   different approximation levels. We show that for the present case, the
   effect of the thermal noise in the atomistic system can be controlled,
   and the MD predictions for the QoIs can be suitably represented using
   low-order PC models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the inference of small-scale, atomistic parameters,
   based on the specification of large, or macroscale, observables.
   Specifically, we focus on estimating a set of force-field parameters for
   the four-site, TIP4P, water model, based on a synthetic problem
   involving isothermal, isobaric molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
   water at ambient conditions. We exploit the polynomial chaos (PC)
   expansions developed in Part I as surrogate representations of three
   macroscale observables, namely density, self-diffusion, and enthalpy, as
   a function of the force-field parameters. We analyze and discuss the use
   of two different PC representations in a Bayesian framework for the
   inference of atomistic parameters, based on synthetic observations of
   three macroscale observables. The first surrogate is a deterministic PC
   representation, constructed in Part I using nonintrusive spectral
   projection (NISP). An alternative strategy exploits a nondeterministic
   PC representation obtained using Bayesian inference of PC coefficients.
   We analyze the sensitivity of selected force-field parameters to the
   macroscale data, namely by exploiting the surrogate models to derive
   suitable ``response{''} surfaces in the space of random parameters. The
   performance of both inference strategies is then examined in light of
   this analysis. The results show that each parameter is very sensitive to
   certain observables, while being only minimally affected by others. We
   show that a suitable choice of the observables allows us to recover the
   presumed ``true{''} set of parameters with high accuracy even with
   low-order surrogate models.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the recovery of an underlying signal x is an element of C-m
   based on projection measurements of the form y = Mx + w, where y is an
   element of C-l and w is measurement noise; we are interested in the case
   l << m. It is assumed that the signal model p(x) is known and that w
   similar to CN(w; 0, Sigma(w)) for known Sigma(w). The objective is to
   design a projection matrix M is an element of C-lxm to maximize key
   information-theoretic quantities with operational significance,
   including the mutual information between the signal and the projections
   I(x; y) or the Renyi entropy of the projections h(alpha) (y) (Shannon
   entropy is a special case). By capitalizing on explicit
   characterizations of the gradients of the information measures with
   respect to the projection matrix, where we also partially extend the
   well-known results of Palomar and Verdu from the mutual information to
   the Renyi entropy domain, we reveal the key operations carried out by
   the optimal projection designs: mode exposure and mode alignment.
   Experiments are considered for the case of compressive sensing (CS)
   applied to imagery. In this context, we provide a demonstration of the
   performance improvement possible through the application of the novel
   projection designs in relation to conventional ones, as well as
   justification for a fast online projection design method with which
   state-of-the-art adaptive CS signal recovery is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an online (real-time) control problem that involves an agent
   performing a discrete-time random walk over a finite state space. The
   agent's action at each time step is to specify the probability
   distribution for the next state given the current state. Following the
   set-up of Todorov (2007, 2009), the state-action cost at each time step
   is a sum of a nonnegative state cost and a control cost given by the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence between the agent's next-state distribution
   and that determined by some fixed passive dynamics. The online aspect of
   the problem is due to the fact that the state cost functions are
   generated by a dynamic environment, and the agent learns the current
   state cost only after having selected the corresponding action. We give
   an explicit construction of an efficient strategy that has small regret
   (i.e., the difference between the total state-action cost incurred
   causally and the smallest cost attainable using noncausal knowledge of
   the state costs) under mild regularity conditions on the passive
   dynamics. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed strategy on a
   simulated target tracking problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an iterative method for determining control
   trajectories for systems subject to state and control constraints. By
   maximizing in the Lagrange multiplier, or dual variable, as opposed to
   minimizing in the control, or primal variable, consistent updating sets
   are determined to converge upon the optimal solution. The method is
   applied to the control of damping forces in an equipment isolation
   system subjected to constraints imposed by the physical implementation
   of a particular controllable damper. Control trajectories are designed
   to minimize peak total response accelerations when the system is excited
   by a pulse-like acceleration at the base. Potential parameterized
   feedback control laws are deduced from optimal control trajectories for
   different excitation frequencies. Performance metrics are compared
   between the proposed method and a passively damped system for a
   single-degree-of-freedom isolation system.}},

Abstract = {{A nonparametric Bayesian model is proposed for segmenting time-evolving
   multivariate spatial point process data. An inhomogeneous Poisson
   process is assumed, with a logistic stick-breaking process (LSBP) used
   to encourage piecewise-constant spatial Poisson intensities. The LSBP
   explicitly favors spatially contiguous segments, and infers the number
   of segments based on the observed data. The temporal dynamics of the
   segmentation and of the Poisson intensities are modeled with exponential
   correlation in time, implemented in the form of a first-order
   autoregressive model for uniformly sampled discrete data, and via a
   Gaussian process with an exponential kernel for general temporal
   sampling. We consider and compare two different inference techniques: a
   Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, which has relatively high
   computational complexity; and an approximate and efficient variational
   Bayesian analysis. The model is demonstrated with a simulated example
   and a real example of space-time crime events in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.}},

Abstract = {{Here we present a simple and transparent alternative to the complex
   models of earth's thermal behaviour under time-changing conditions. We
   show the one-to-one relationship between changes in atmospheric
   properties and time-dependent changes in temperature and its
   distribution on earth. The model accounts for convection and radiation,
   thermal inertia and changes in albedo (rho) and greenhouse factor
   (gamma). The constructal law is used as the principle that governs the
   evolution of flow configuration on earth. The model showed that for two
   time-dependent scenarios, (delta(rho)=0.002; delta(gamma)=0.011) and
   (delta(rho)=0.002; delta(gamma)=0.005) the predicted equatorial and
   polar temperature increases and the time scales are (Delta T-II=1.16 K;
   Delta T-L=1.11 K; 104 years) and (0.41K; 0.41 K; 57 years),
   respectively. A continuous model of temperature variation was used to
   predict the thermal response of the Earth's surface to changes bounded
   by delta(rho)=delta(gamma) and delta(rho)=-delta(gamma) The polcward
   heat current reaches its maximum in the vicinity of 35 latitude,
   accounting for the position of the Ferrel cell between the Hadley and

Title = {{Kinematic and dynamic gait compensations resulting from knee instability
   in a rat model of osteoarthritis}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) results in pain and disability;
   however, preclinical OA models often focus on joint-level changes. Gait
   analysis is one method used to evaluate both preclinical OA models and
   OA patients. The objective of this study is to describe spatiotemporal
   and ground reaction force changes in a rat medial meniscus transection
   (MMT) model of knee OA and to compare these gait measures with assays of
   weight bearing and tactile allodynia.
   Methods: Sixteen rats were used in the study. The medial collateral
   ligament (MCL) was transected in twelve Lewis rats (male, 200 to 250 g);
   in six rats, the medial meniscus was transected, and the remaining six
   rats served as sham controls. The remaining four rats served as naive
   controls. Gait, weight-bearing as measured by an incapacitance meter,
   and tactile allodynia were assessed on postoperative days 9 to 24. On
   day 28, knee joints were collected for histology. Cytokine
   concentrations in the serum were assessed with a 10-plex cytokine panel.
   Results: Weight bearing was not affected by sham or MMT surgery;
   however, the MMT group had decreased mechanical paw-withdrawal
   thresholds in the operated limb relative to the contralateral limb (P =
   0.017). The gait of the MMT group became increasingly asymmetric from
   postoperative days 9 to 24 (P = 0.020); moreover, MMT animals tended to
   spend more time on their contralateral limb than their operated limb
   while walking (P < 0.1). Ground reaction forces confirmed temporal
   shifts in symmetry and stance time, as the MMT group had lower vertical
   and propulsive ground reaction forces in their operated limb relative to
   the contralateral limb, naive, and sham controls (P < 0.05). Levels of
   interleukin 6 in the MMT group tended to be higher than naive controls
   (P = 0.072). Histology confirmed increased cartilage damage in the MMT
   group, consistent with OA initiation. Post hoc analysis revealed that
   gait symmetry, stance time imbalance, peak propulsive force, and serum
   interleukin 6 concentrations had significant correlations to the
   severity of cartilage lesion formation.
   Conclusion: These data indicate significant gait compensations were
   present in the MMT group relative to medial collateral ligament (MCL)
   injury (sham) alone and naive controls. Moreover, these data suggest
   that gait compensations are likely driven by meniscal instability and/or
   cartilage damage, and not by MCL injury alone.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between plant hydraulics and plant structure was
   documented by Leonardo da Vinci, and its importance as a regulator of

   the role of hydraulics in plant function, with a focus on the regulation
   of plant stomata and xylem water potentials, the morphology of branching
   networks in vines and trees, and the spatial organization of vegetation
   at landscape scales. Outstanding challenges include mechanistic and
   boundary condition descriptions of specific processes, the need to
   accommodate multiple spatial and temporal scales that do not lend
   themselves to statistical treatment and the self-referential nature of

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidic biochips are being increasingly used for
   biotechnology applications. The number of control pins used to drive
   electrodes is a major contributor to fabrication cost for disposable
   biochips in a highly cost-sensitive market. Most prior work on
   pin-constrained biochip design determines the mapping of a small number
   of control pins to a larger number of electrodes according to the
   specific schedule of fluid-handling operations and routing paths of
   droplets. Such designs are therefore specific to the bioassay
   application, hence sacrificing some of the flexibility associated with
   digital microfluidics. We propose a design method to gene rate an
   application-independent pin-assignment configuration with a minimum
   number of control pins. Layouts of a commercial biochip and laboratory
   prototypes are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design
   method for determining a suitable pin-assignment configuration. Compared
   with previous pin-assignment algorithms, the proposed method can reduce
   the number of control pins and facilitate the ``general-purpose{''} use
   of digital microfluidic biochips for a wide range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional integration based on die/wafer stacking and
   through-silicon-vias (TSVs) promises to overcome interconnect
   bottlenecks for nanoscale integrated circuits (ICs). However, TSVs are
   prone to defects such as shorts and opens that affect circuit operation
   in stacked ICs. W e analyze the impact of open defects on TSVs and
   describe techniques for screening such defects. The proposed
   characterization technique estimates the additional delay introduced due
   to a resistive open defect as well as due to re-routing based on spare
   TSVs. W e also present an optimization method based on integer linear
   programming (ILP) that allocates spares to functional TSVs such that the
   spare for a functional TSV is neither too close to a functional TSV (to
   avoid the case of both functional and spare TSV being defective) nor too
   far to ensure that the additional delay due to rerouting is below an
   upper limit. Results are presented using Hspice simulations based on a
   45 nm predictive technology model, recently published data on TSV
   parasitics, and a commercial ILP solver.}},

Abstract = {{Software aging often affects the performance of software systems and
   eventually causes them to fail. A complementary approach to handle
   transient software failures due to the software aging is called software
   rejuvenation, and can be regarded as a preventive and proactive solution
   that is particularly useful for counteracting the phenomenon of software
   aging. In this paper, we consider the optimal software rejuvenation
   policies maximizing the interval reliability by using the Markov
   regenerative processes. We derive analytically the optimal software
   rejuvenation timing which maximizes the limitting interval reliability
   or the interval reliability with exponentially distributed operation
   time. Further, we examine numerically the transient behavior of the
   interval reliability at an arbitrary operation time. Our results under
   the interval reliability criteria are extentions of some earlier works,
   since the interval reliability involves the pointwise system
   availability and the common reliability function as special cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design of a deep-UV Raman imaging spectrometer
   operating with an excitation wavelength of 228 nm. The designed system
   will provide the ability to detect explosives (both traditional military
   explosives and home-made explosives) from standoff distances of 1-10
   meters with an interrogation area of 1 mm x 1 mm to 200 mm x 200 mm.
   This excitation wavelength provides resonant enhancement of many common
   explosives, no background fluorescence, and an enhanced cross-section
   due to the inverse wavelength scaling of Raman scattering. A
   coded-aperture spectrograph combined with compressive imaging algorithms
   will allow for wide-area interrogation with fast acquisition rates.
   Coded-aperture spectral imaging exploits the compressibility of
   hyperspectral data-cubes to greatly reduce the amount of acquired data
   needed to interrogate an area. The resultant systems are able to cover
   wider areas much faster than traditional push-broom and tunable filter
   systems. The full system design will be presented along with initial
   data from the instrument. Estimates for area scanning rates and chemical
   sensitivity will be presented. The system components include a
   solid-state deep-UV laser operating at 228 nm, a spectrograph consisting
   of well-corrected refractive imaging optics and a reflective grating, an
   intensified solar-blind CCD camera, and a high-efficiency collection
   optic.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel theoretical characterization of the
   performance of nonlocal means (NLM) for noise removal. NLM has proved
   effective in a variety of empirical studies, but little is understood
   fundamentally about how it performs relative to classical methods based
   on wavelets or how its parameters should be chosen. For cartoon images
   and images which may contain thin features and regular textures, the
   error decay rates of NLM are derived and compared with those of linear
   filtering, oracle estimators, Yaroslavsky's filter, and wavelet
   thresholding estimators. The trade-off between global and local search
   for matching patches is examined, and the bias reduction associated with
   the local polynomial regression version of NLM is analyzed. The
   theoretical results are validated via simulations for two-dimensional
   images corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise.}},

Abstract = {{Several information theoretic functions have been proposed in the
   literature to assess the information value of sensor measurements a
   posteriori, that is, after measurements have been obtained from one or
   more targets. Sensor planning algorithms, however, require that the
   value of future sensor measurements be computed a priori, based on
   available models and prior information. An approach was recently
   presented by the authors for estimating the expected information value
   of future sensor measurements in target classification problems. The
   approach derives expected information theoretic functions from
   probabilistic models of the sensors and the targets, conditioned on
   prior information. In this paper, the approach is extended to the
   problem of sensor planning for tracking maneuvering targets. The
   approach is illustrated for a sensor that obeys an exponential power law
   model of received isotropic energy, and a target that obeys a Markov
   motion model. The performance of five information theoretic functions is
   compared through numerical simulations, and the results show that the
   objective function based on conditional mutual information leads to the
   most effective sensor planning strategy.}},

Abstract = {{A method for Bayesian factor analysis (FA) of large matrices is
   proposed. It is assumed that a small number of matrix elements are
   initially observed, and the statistical FA model is employed to actively
   and sequentially select which new matrix entries would be most
   informative, in order to estimate the remaining missing entries, i.e.,
   complete the matrix. The model inference and active learning are
   performed within an online variational Bayes (VB) framework. A fast and
   provably near-optimal greedy algorithm is used to sequentially maximize
   the mutual information contribution from new observations, taking
   advantage of submodularity properties. Additionally, a simple
   alternative procedure is proposed, in which the posterior parameters
   learned by the Bayesian approach are directly used. This alternative
   procedure is shown to achieve slightly higher prediction error, but
   requires much fewer computational resources. The methods are
   demonstrated on a very large matrix factorization problem, namely the
   Yahoo! Music ratings dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Multispectral fluorescence data can be used within sparse decomposition
   methods to separate key cellular structures, even when the number of
   photons per spectral band is very small. However, there are two key
   costs associated with multispectral data acquisition: (a) for a fixed
   data acquisition time, increasing the number of spectral bands means
   decreasing the number of photons (and hence SNR) per band, and (b) the
   optical system becomes more complex and expensive. These costs lead to
   important tradeoffs between the information content and the noise of the
   observations. This paper describes a mathematical framework for
   assessing this tradeoff and supporting experimental results.}},

   image is denoised by a classical denoising method (e.g., wavelet or

   Yaroslavsky filter is performed on the original noisy image, where the
   weights of the filters are governed by pixel similarities in the
   denoised image from the first stage. The procedure is supported by
   theoretical guarantees, achieves very good performance for cartoon

   MOUSSE uses linear subsets of low-dimensional hyperplanes to approximate

Abstract = {{Mechanical loading induces both nuclear distortion and alterations in
   gene expression in a variety of cell types. Mechanotransduction is the
   process by which extracellular mechanical forces can activate a number
   of well-studied cytoplasmic signaling cascades. Inevitably, such signals
   are transduced to the nucleus and induce transcription factor-mediated
   changes in gene expression. However, gene expression also can be
   regulated through alterations in nuclear architecture, providing direct
   control of genome function. One putative transduction mechanism for this
   phenomenon involves alterations in nuclear architecture that result from
   the mechanical perturbation of the cell. This perturbation is associated
   with direct mechanical strain or osmotic stress, which is transferred to
   the nucleus. This review describes the current state of knowledge
   relating the nuclear architecture and the transfer of mechanical forces
   to the nucleus mediated by the cytoskeleton, the nucleoskeleton, and the
   LINC (linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex. Moreover,
   remodeling of the nucleus induces alterations in nuclear stiffness,
   which may be associated with cell differentiation. These phenomena are
   discussed in relation to the potential influence of nuclear
   architecture-mediated mechanoregulation of transcription and cell fate.}},

Abstract = {{3D integrated circuits (3D ICs) based on through-silicon vias (TSVs)
   have emerged as a promising solution for overcoming interconnect and

   new defects in devices and interconnects. The paper next describes
   recent advances in testing, diagnosis, and design-for-testability for 3D
   ICs and techniques for defect tolerance using redundancy and repair.
   Topics covered include various types of TSV defects, stress-induced

Abstract = {{Constraints such as limited security investment cost precludes a
   security decision maker from implementing all possible countermeasures
   in a system. Existing analytical model-based security optimization
   strategies do not prevail for the following reasons: (i) none of these
   model-based methods offer a way to find optimal security solution in the
   absence of probability assignments to the model, (ii) methods scale
   badly as size of the system to model increases and (iii) some methods
   suffer as they use attack trees (AT) whose structure does not allow for
   the inclusion of countermeasures while others translate the
   non-state-space model (e.g., attack response tree) into a state-space
   model hence causing state-space explosion.
   In this paper, we use a novel AT paradigm called attack countermeasure
   tree (ACT) whose structure takes into account attacks as well as
   countermeasures (in the form of detection and mitigation events). We use
   greedy and branch and bound techniques to study several objective
   functions with goals such as minimizing the number of countermeasures,
   security investment cost in the ACT and maximizing the benefit from
   implementing a certain countermeasure set in the ACT under different
   constraints. We cast each optimization problem into an integer
   programming problem which also allows us to find optimal solution even
   in the absence of probability assignments to the model. Our method
   scales well for large ACTs and we compare its efficiency with other
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Reversibility as an inherent requirement of quantum computation
   motivates further research on reversible logic. Due to anticipated high
   failure rates for such technologies, thorough testing is a must for
   these circuits. In this paper, we present a compact test generation and
   application method for reversible circuits which achieves high (100\%)
   fault coverage and can be adopted for BIST implementations. In this
   method, the next test pattern is the response of the reversible circuit
   to the previous test pattern. A test generation algorithm to minimize
   test time and achieve 100\% fault coverage is also presented. Simulation
   results on a set of reversible benchmark circuits confirm that this
   approach can detect all single missing/repeated gate faults as well as
   the majority of multiple faults.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of broadband spatial spectrum
   estimation using multiple spatially-aliased arrays. Unlike previous
   approaches using sparse arrays, the signals here are assumed to be
   uncorrelated between multiple arrays which, in fact, may be receiving
   the same source during different time intervals. This paper presents an
   approach which jointly exploits spatial-orientation and broadband
   temporal diversity in order to estimate the spatial spectrum even when
   the inter-element spacing within each array is greater than a
   half-wavelength. A dynamical model for the spatial spectrum is employed
   to formulate a maximum likelihood estimate, which is computed via a
   recursive version of the expectation-maximization algorithm using data
   from different arrays. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate
   the ability of the method to suppress spatial grating lobes and increase
   low SNR target detection in an interference dominated environment.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has been widely adopted in multicore SoCs
   for reducing dynamic power consumption. Despite its benefits, the use of
   DVS increases test time because high product quality can only be ensured
   by testing every core at multiple supported voltage settings; hence the
   repetitive application of the same or different tests at multiple
   voltage settings becomes necessary. In addition, testing at lower supply
   voltage settings increases considerably the length of each test because
   lower scan frequencies must be used for shifting test data using scan
   chains. Standard scheduling techniques fail to reduce the test time for
   DVS-based SoCs since they do not model testing at multiple voltage
   settings. In addition, they do not consider the practical aspects of
   tester overhead and the dependencies between core voltage settings due
   to the use of voltage islands. To alleviate the detrimental impact of
   DVS on test application time, we propose a time-division multiplexing
   (TDM) method and an integer linear programming-based test scheduling
   technique, which exploit high automatic test equipment (ATE) frequencies
   even when low shift frequencies must be used at low voltage settings.
   Experimental results on two industrial SoCs highlight the effectiveness
   of TDM and the associated scheduling method.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a technique to create complex, high
   cholesterol-containing supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) using
   alpha-helical (AH) peptide-induced vesicle fusion. Vesicles consisting
   of POPC : POPE : POPS : SM : Chol (9.35 : 19.25 : 8.25 : 18.15 : 45.00)
   were used to form a SLB that models the native composition of the human
   immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) lipid envelope. In the absence of AH
   peptides, these biomimetic vesicles fail to form a complete SLB. We
   verified and characterized AH peptide-induced vesicle fusion by a quartz
   crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, neutron reflectivity,
   and atomic force microscopy. Successful SLB formation entailed a
   characteristic frequency shift of -35.4 +/- 0.8 Hz and a change in
   dissipation energy of 1.91 +/- 0.23 x 10(-6). Neutron reflectivity
   measurements determined the SLB thickness to be 49.9(-1.5)(+1.9)
   angstrom, and showed the SLB to be 100 (+0.0)(-0.1)\% complete and void
   of residual AH peptide after washing. Atomic force microscopy imaging
   confirmed complete SLB formation and revealed three distinct domains
   with no visible defects. This vesicle fusion technique gives researchers
   access to a complex SLB composition with high cholesterol content and
   thus the ability to better recapitulate the native HIV-1 lipid}},

Abstract = {{The more nanotechnology develops, the more likely the release of

   of engineered nanoparticles pose a big challenge to analysts. Moreover,
   identification in a qualitative sense and quantification by mass
   concentration alone are not sufficient, because the potential
   environmental hazard arising from engineered nanoparticles is controlled
   by many other properties of the particles. We discuss the most important
   methods of fractionation and detection of both natural and engineered
   nanoparticles, with a focus on the chemical nature of the particles,
   particle concentration, and particle size. Analyses should not rely on
   only one method; instead, several complementary methods should, if
   possible, be used. Coupled techniques should be further developed and
   increasingly applied. Dedicated techniques that are tailored to the
   search for a particular sort of engineered nanoparticles are more
   promising than universal approaches that search for any engineered

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Aiming to efficiently overcome the acoustic refraction and accurately
   reconstruct the microwave absorption properties in heterogeneous tissue,
   an iterative reconstruction method is proposed for microwave-induced
   thermo-acoustic tomography (MITAT) system. Most current imaging methods
   in MITAT assume that the heterogeneous sound velocity (SV) distribution
   obeys a simple Gaussian distribution. In real problem, the biological
   tissue may have several different inclusions with different SV
   distribution. In this case, the acoustic refraction must be taken into
   account. The proposed iterative method is consisted of an iterative
   engine with time reversal mirror (TRM), fast marching method (FMM) and
   simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART). This method
   utilizes TRM, FMM and SART to estimate the SV distribution of tissue to
   solve the phase distortion problem caused by the acoustic refraction
   effect and needs little prior knowledge of the tissue. The proposed
   method has great advantages in both spatial resolution and contrast for
   imaging tumors in acoustically heterogeneous medium. Some numerical
   simulation results are given to demonstrate the excellent performance of
   the proposed method.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2759-2769}},
Abstract = {{Malaria is a geographically widespread infectious disease that is well
   known to be affected by climate variability at both seasonal and
   interannual timescales. In an effort to identify climatic factors that
   impact malaria dynamics, there has been considerable research focused on
   the development of appropriate disease models for malaria transmission
   driven by climatic time series. These analyses have focused largely on
   variation in temperature and rainfall as direct climatic drivers of
   malaria dynamics. Here, we further these efforts by considering
   additionally the role that soil water content may play in driving
   malaria incidence. Specifically, we hypothesize that hydro-climatic
   variability should be an important factor in controlling the
   availability of mosquito habitats, thereby governing mosquito growth
   rates. To test this hypothesis, we reduce a nonlinear ecohydrological
   model to a simple linear model through a series of consecutive
   assumptions and apply this model to malaria incidence data from three
   South African provinces. Despite the assumptions made in the reduction
   of the model, we show that soil water content can account for a
   significant portion of malaria's case variability beyond its seasonal
   patterns, whereas neither temperature nor rainfall alone can do so.
   Future work should therefore consider soil water content as a simple and
   computable variable for incorporation into climate-driven disease models
   of malaria and other vector-borne infectious diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel miniaturized bandpass filter (BPF) using a
   circular dual-mode resonator with both capacitive source-load (S-L)
   coupling and inductive S-L coupling is presented for the first time. The
   proposed filter consists of a circular open stub-loaded dual-mode
   resonator and two meandering feed lines with both capacitive and
   inductive S-L coupling to obtain seven transmission zeros and good
   harmonic suppression. Compared with the other two BPFs using two
   conventional feeding styles, i.e. only capacitive S-L coupling and only
   inductive S-L coupling, this type of BPF can not only possess a
   dual-mode response, but also generate more transmission zeros to
   suppress an undesired harmonic passband. Moreover, the transmission
   zeros can be also controllable to meet the required filter selectivity.
   The simulated and measured results are presented and show good
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid approximate dynamic programming (ADP)
   method for a hybrid dynamic system (HDS) optimal control problem, that
   occurs in many complex unmanned systems which are implemented via a
   hybrid architecture, regarding robot modes or the complex environment.
   The HDS considered in this paper is characterized by a well-known
   three-layer hybrid framework, which includes a discrete event controller
   layer, a discrete-continuous interface layer, and a continuous state
   layer. The hybrid optimal control problem (HOCP) is to find the optimal
   discrete event decisions and the optimal continuous controls subject to
   a deterministic minimization of a scalar function regarding the system
   state and control over time. Due to the uncertainty of environment and
   complexity of the HOCP, the cost-to-go cannot be evaluated before the
   HDS explores the entire system state space; as a result, the optimal
   control, neither continuous nor discrete, is not available ahead of
   time. Therefore, ADP is adopted to learn the optimal control while the
   HDS is exploring the environment, because of the online advantage of ADP
   method. Furthermore, ADP can break the curses of dimensionality which
   other optimizing methods, such as dynamic programming (DP) and Markov
   decision process (MDP), are facing due to the high dimensions of HOCP.}},

Abstract = {{A novel flow-based method is presented to place catalytic nanoparticles
   into a reactor by sol-gelation of a porous ceramic consisting of
   copper-based nanoparticles, silica sand, ceramic binder, and a gelation
   agent. This method allows for the placement of a liquid precursor
   containing the catalyst into the final reactor geometry without the need
   of impregnating or coating of a substrate with the catalytic material.
   The so generated foam-like porous ceramic shows properties highly
   appropriate for use as catalytic reactor material, e. g., reasonable
   pressure drop due to its porosity, high thermal and catalytic stability,
   and excellent catalytic behavior. The catalytic activity of
   micro-reactors containing this foam-like ceramic is tested in terms of
   their ability to convert alcoholic biofuel (e. g. methanol) to a
   hydrogen-rich gas mixture with low concentrations of carbon monoxide (up
   to 75\% hydrogen content and less than 0.2\% CO, for the case of
   methanol). This gas mixture is subsequently used in a low-temperature
   fuel cell, converting the hydrogen directly to electricity. A low
   concentration of CO is crucial to avoid poisoning of the fuel cell
   catalyst. Since conventional Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel
   cells require CO concentrations far below 100 ppm and since most methods
   to reduce the mole fraction of CO (such as Preferential Oxidation or
   PROX) have CO conversions of up to 99\%, the alcohol fuel reformer has
   to achieve initial CO mole fractions significantly below 1\%. The
   catalyst and the porous ceramic reactor of the present study can
   successfully fulfill this requirement.}},

Abstract = {{Resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE)
   is a variation of pulsed laser deposition that is useful for
   organic-based thin films because it reduces material degradation by
   selective absorption of infrared radiation in the host matrix. A unique
   emulsion-based RIR-MAPLE approach has been developed that reduces
   substrate exposure to solvents and provides controlled and repeatable
   organic thin film deposition. In order to establish emulsion-based
   RIR-MAPLE as a preferred deposition technique for conjugated polymer or
   hybrid nanocomposite optoelectronic devices, studies have been conducted
   to demonstrate the value added by the approach in comparison to
   traditional solution-based deposition techniques, and this work will be
   reviewed. The control of hybrid nanocomposite thin film deposition, and
   the photoconductivity in such materials deposited using emulsion-based
   RIR-MAPLE, will also be reviewed. The overall result of these studies is
   the demonstration of emulsion-based RIR-MAPLE as a viable option for the
   fabrication of conjugated polymer and hybrid nanocomposite
   optoelectronic devices that could yield improved device performance.}},

   constrained sparse triangular-array}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{A new configuration of sparse array is proposed in this article to
   estimate the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) and polarizations of multiple
   sources. This constrained sparse array is composed of a dipole-triad, a
   loop-triad, and a single antenna, which can be a dipole, a loop, or a
   scalar-sensor. These three units comprise a triangular geometry in the
   space. This geometry creatively synergizes the conventional
   interferometry method based on the spatial phase-delay across displaced
   antennas, and the ``vector-cross-product{''} based on Poynting-vector
   estimator to enhance the DOA estimation accuracy. The investigated
   algorithm based on this configuration adopts the
   ``vector-cross-product{''} DOA estimator to provide the coarse estimate
   and then derives the fine estimate by extracting the inter-sensor phase
   factors in the sparse array. Following this, the disambiguation approach
   is adapted to derive the unambiguous estimate, and this estimate is also
   fine in estimation resolution. The proposed configuration can extend the
   array aperture and also reduce the mutual coupling. The significant
   performance of the proposed sparse array composition is demonstrated by
   Monte Carlo simulations when the inter-sensor spacing far exceeds a
   half-wavelength.}},

   Megaptera novaeangliae: insights from multi-sensor suction cup tags}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{209-220}},
Abstract = {{Previously, all inferences regarding fine-scale baleen whale mother-calf
   relationships have come from surface observations, aerial surveys, or
   underwater video recordings. On May 19, 2010, we attached
   high-resolution digital acoustic recording tags (Dtags) to an adult
   female humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and her calf in Wilhelmina
   Bay (Western Antarctic Peninsula) to examine their concurrent diving and
   foraging behaviour. The Dtags logged similar to 20 h of concurrent
   recordings. We used cross-correlation analyses to quantify synchrony
   between the pair. Dive depth was positively correlated for the duration
   of the concurrent record and was highest when the calf's track lagged
   behind the mother's by 4.5 s, suggesting that the calf was `following'
   its mother. Pitch and heading were positively correlated but to a lesser
   degree. Both animals executed feeding lunges; however, the mother
   foraged more intensively than the calf (792 and 118 lunges over 246 and
   30 feeding dives, respectively). Also, the mother fed consistently once
   she initiated feeding at 16:22:00 h until the tag came off, whereas the
   calf executed 95.76\% of its lunges between 17:00:08 and 19:28:21 h,
   local time. Correlation coefficients calculated per dive were highest
   when both animals were feeding and lowest when only the mother was
   feeding. In addition, 84.26 and 79.63\% of the calf's lunges were
   performed within +/- 20 s and +/- 20 m of its mother's lunges,
   respectively. Our work describes the first record of a long-term
   continuous underwater relationship and foraging behaviour of a humpback
   mother-calf pair.}},

Title = {{Miniature microwave applicator for murine bladder hyperthermia studies}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{456-465}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Novel combinations of heat with chemotherapeutic agents are
   often studied in murine tumour models. Currently, no device exists to
   selectively heat small tumours at depth in mice. In this project we
   modelled, built and tested a miniature microwave heat applicator, the
   physical dimensions of which can be scaled to adjust the volume and
   depth of heating to focus on the tumour volume. Of particular interest
   is a device that can selectively heat murine bladder.
   Materials and methods: Using Avizo (R) segmentation software, we created
   a numerical mouse model based on micro-MRI scan data. The model was
   imported into HFSS (TM) (Ansys) simulation software and parametric
   studies were performed to optimise the dimensions of a water-loaded
   circular waveguide for selective power deposition inside a 0.15 mL
   bladder. A working prototype was constructed operating at 2.45 GHz.
   Heating performance was characterised by mapping fibre-optic temperature
   sensors along catheters inserted at depths of 0-1 mm (subcutaneous), 2-3
   mm (vaginal), and 4-5 mm (rectal) below the abdominal wall, with the mid
   depth catheter adjacent to the bladder. Core temperature was monitored
   orally.
   Results: Thermal measurements confirm the simulations which demonstrate
   that this applicator can provide local heating at depth in small
   animals. Measured temperatures in murine pelvis show well-localised
   bladder heating to 42-43 degrees C while maintaining normothermic skin
   and core temperatures.
   Conclusions: Simulation techniques facilitate the design optimisation of
   microwave antennas for use in pre-clinical applications such as
   localised tumour heating in small animals. Laboratory measurements
   demonstrate the effectiveness of a new miniature water-coupled microwave
   applicator for localised heating of murine bladder.}},

Abstract = {{Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been extensively employed as a
   technology for the detection of subsurface buried threats. Although
   vehicular mounted GPRs generate data in three dimensions, alarm
   declarations are usually only available in the form of 2-D spatial
   coordinates. The uncertainty in the depth of the target in the three
   dimensional volume of data, and the difficulties associated with
   automatically localizing objects in depth, can adversely impact feature
   extraction and training in some detection algorithms. In order to
   mitigate the negative impact of uncertainty in target depth, several
   algorithms have been developed that extract features from multiple depth
   regions and utilize these feature vectors in classification algorithms
   to perform final mine/nonmine decisions. However, the uncertainty in
   object depth significantly complicates learning since features at the
   correct target depth are often significantly different from features at
   other depths but in the same volume. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is
   a type of supervised learning approach in which labels are available for
   a collection of feature vectors but not for individual samples, or in
   this application, depths. The goal of MIL is to classify new collections
   of vectors as they become available. This set-based learning method is
   applicable in the landmine detection problem because features that are
   extracted independently from several depth bins can be viewed as a set
   of unlabeled feature vectors, where the entire set either corresponds to
   a buried threat or a false alarm. In this work, a novel generative
   Dirichlet Process Gaussian mixture model for MIL is developed that
   automatically infers the number of mixture components required to model
   the underlying distributions of mine/non-mine signatures and performs
   classification using a likelihood ratio test. In this work, we show that
   the performance of the proposed approach for discriminating targets from
   non-targets in GPR data is promising.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a very useful technology for buried
   threat detection applications which is capable of identifying both
   metallic and non-metallic objects with moderate false alarm rates.
   Several pattern classification algorithms have been proposed and
   evaluated which enable GPR systems to achieve robust performance.
   However, comparisons of these algorithms have shown that their relative
   performance varies with respect to the environmental context under which
   the GPR is operating. Context-dependent fusion has been proposed as a
   technique for algorithm fusion and has been shown to improve performance
   by exploiting the differences in algorithm performance under different
   environmental and operating conditions. Early approaches to
   context-dependent fusion clustered observations in the joint confidence
   space of all algorithms and applied fusion rules within each cluster
   (i.e., discriminative learning). Later approaches exploited
   physics-based features extracted from the background data to leverage
   more environmental information, but decoupled context learning from
   algorithm fusion (i.e., generative learning). In this work, a Bayesian
   inference technique which combines the generative and discriminative
   approaches is proposed for physics-based context-dependent fusion of
   detection algorithms for GPR. The method uses a Dirichlet process (DP)
   mixture as a model for context, and relevance vector machines (RVMs) as
   models for algorithm fusion. Variational Bayes is used as an approximate
   inference technique for joint learning of the context and fusion models.
   Experimental results compare the proposed Bayesian discriminative
   technique to generative techniques developed in past work by
   investigating the similarities and differences in the contexts learned
   as well as overall detection performance.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle-mounted ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has proved to be a
   valuable technology for buried threat detection, especially in the area
   of military route clearance. However, detection performance may be
   degraded in very rough terrain or off-road conditions. This is because
   the signal processing approaches for target detection in GPR first
   identify the ground reflection in the data, and then align the data in
   order to remove the ground reflection. Under extremely rough terrain,
   antenna bounce and multipath effects render finding the ground
   reflection a difficult task, and errors in ground localization can lead
   to data alignment that distorts potential target signatures and/or
   creates false alarms. In this work, commercial-off-the-shelf light
   detection and ranging (LIDAR), global positioning system (GPS), and
   inertial measurement unit (IMU) were integrated with a GPR into a
   prototype route clearance system. The LIDAR provided high-resolution
   measurements of the ground surface profile, and the GPS/IMU recorded the
   vehicle's position and orientation. Experiments investigated the
   applicability of the integrated system for finding the ground reflection
   in GPR data and decoupling vehicle motion from the rough surface
   response. Assessment of ground-tracking performance was based on an
   experiment involving three prepared test lanes, each with different
   configurations of buried targets and terrain obstacles. Several
   algorithms for target detection in GPR were applied to the data, both
   with traditional preprocessing and incorporating the LIDAR and IMU.
   Experimental results suggest that the LIDAR and IMU may be valuable
   components for ground tracking in next-generation GPR systems.}},

Abstract = {{Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a commonly employed sensing modality
   for landmine detection. It has been successfully deployed in vehicular
   systems, and is also being integrated into handheld systems. Handheld
   mine detection systems are typically deployed in situations where either
   the terrain or mission renders a vehicular-based system less effective.
   Handheld systems are often more compact and maneuverable, but quality of
   the sensor data may also be more dependent on the operators experience
   with and technique in using the system. In particular, the sensor height
   with respect to the air-ground interface may be more variable than with
   a vehicular-based system. This variation in sensor height above the
   air-ground interface may have the potential to adversely affect mine
   detection performance with the GPR sensing modality. In this work, the
   effects of operator technique on handheld sensor data quality is
   investigated, and ground alignment is explored as a potential approach
   to reducing variability in the sensor data quality due to operator
   technique. Results for data measured with a standard GPR/EMI handheld
   sensor at a standardized test site are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The quantification of lung nodule volume based on CT images provides
   valuable information for disease diagnosis and staging. However, the
   precision of the quantification is protocol, system, and technique
   dependent and needs to be evaluated for each specific case. To
   efficiently investigate the quantitative precision and find an optimal
   operating point, it is important to develop a predictive model based on
   basic system parameters. In this study, a Fourier-based metric, the
   estimability index (e') was proposed as such a predictor, and validated
   across a variety of imaging conditions. To first obtain the ground truth
   of quantitative precision, an anthropomorphic chest phantom with
   synthetic spherical nodules were imaged on a 64 slice CT scanner across
   a range of protocols (five exposure levels and two reconstruction
   algorithms). The volumes of nodules were quantified from the images
   using clinical software, with the precision of the quantification
   calculated for each protocol. To predict the precision, e' was
   calculated for each protocol based on several Fourier-based figures of
   merit, which modeled the characteristic of the quantitation task and the
   imaging condition (resolution, noise, etc.) of a particular protocol.
   Results showed a strong correlation (R-2=0.92) between the measured and
   predicted precision across all protocols, indicating e' as an effective
   predictor of the quantitative precision. This study provides a useful
   framework for quantification-oriented optimization of CT protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a novel x-ray imaging technique
   that provides 3D structural information of the breast. In contrast to 2D
   mammography, DBT minimizes tissue overlap potentially improving cancer
   detection and reducing number of unnecessary recalls. The addition of a
   contrast agent to DBT and mammography for lesion enhancement has the
   benefit of providing functional information of a lesion, as lesion
   contrast uptake and washout patterns may help differentiate between
   benign and malignant tumors. This study used a task-based method to
   determine the optimal imaging approach by analyzing six imaging
   paradigms in terms of their ability to resolve iodine at a given dose:
   contrast enhanced mammography and tomosynthesis, temporal subtraction
   mammography and tomosynthesis, and dual energy subtraction mammography
   and tomosynthesis. Imaging performance was characterized using a
   detectability index d', derived from the system task transfer function
   (TTF), an imaging task, iodine contrast, and the noise power spectrum
   (NNPS). The task modeled a 5 mm lesion containing iodine concentrations
   between 2.1 mg/cc and 8.6 mg/cc. TTF was obtained using an edge phantom,
   and the NNPS was measured over several exposure levels, energies, and
   target-filter combinations. Using a structured CIRS phantom, d' was
   generated as a function of dose and iodine concentration. In general,
   higher dose gave higher d', but for the lowest iodine concentration and
   lowest dose, dual energy subtraction tomosynthesis and temporal
   subtraction tomosynthesis demonstrated the highest performance.}},

Abstract = {{Mammography is currently the most widely accepted tool for detection and
   diagnosis of breast cancer. However, the sensitivity of mammography is
   reduced in women with dense breast tissue due to tissue overlap, which
   may obscure lesions. Digital breast tomosynthesis with contrast
   enhancement reduces tissue overlap and provides additional functional
   information about lesions (i.e. morphology and kinetics), which in turn
   may improve lesion characterization. The performance of such techniques
   is highly dependent on the structural composition of the breast, which
   varies significantly across patients. Therefore, optimization of breast
   imaging systems should be done with respect to this patient versatility.
   Furthermore, imaging techniques that employ contrast require the
   inclusion of a temporally varying breast composition with respect to the
   contrast agent kinetics to enable the optimization of the system. To
   these ends, we have developed a dynamic 4D anthropomorphic breast
   phantom, which can be used for optimizing a breast imaging system by
   incorporating material characteristics. The presented dynamic phantom is
   based on two recently developed anthropomorphic breast phantoms, which
   can be representative of a whole population through their randomized
   anatomical feature generation and various compression levels. The 4D
   dynamic phantom is incorporated with the kinetics of contrast agent
   uptake in different tissues and can realistically model benign and
   malignant lesions. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed dynamic
   phantom, contrast-enhanced digital mammography and breast tomosynthesis
   were simulated where a ray-tracing algorithm emulated the projections, a
   filtered back projection algorithm was used for reconstruction, and
   dual-energy and temporal subtractions were performed and compared.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately targeting of small lesions for success is crucial in breast
   biopsy. In this paper, we proposed a new 3D tomo-based biopsy, which is
   characterized in being more accurate, easier to perform, lower in dose,
   and free of metal artifact. In the scout phase, a conventional
   tomosynthesis scan is performed, and the reconstructed 3D image is then
   used for radiologists to accurately localize target volume and determine
   optimized needle path. In the prefire phase, two prefire stereotactic
   images are obtained at +24 degrees and -24 degrees angular levels for
   retrieving needle and shifted lesion locations. By combining the
   reconstructed 3D tomosynthesis image, needle location and lesion
   location, synthetic prefire and postfire images are generated for
   radiologists' reference before firing the real needle. The proposed
   scheme not only improves the biopsy accuracy but also reduces dose by
   3.7-5.6 times compared to conventional mammo-based stereotactic biopsy.
   A simulation using anthropomorphic phantom was conducted to verify our
   method. Both needle and lesion were precisely recovered just based on
   two tomo angled images. For the needle registration, the sum of
   translation discrepancy is less than 3 pixels, and the sum of rotation
   discrepancy is less than 3 degrees. For the lesion registration, the sum
   of coordinate discrepancy is less than 4 pixels. The predicted 3D
   prefire and postfire images exhibited more intuitive spatial
   relationship of the shifted lesion and biopsy needle tip than
   mammo-based stereotactic biopsy.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was twofold: (a) to estimate patient-and

   computer tomography (CT) scans; (b) to evaluate the effects of patient
   anatomical characteristics (size, age, and gender) and CT scanner model
   on dose and risk conversion coefficients. The study included 100 patient
   models (42 pediatric models, 58 adult models) and multi-detector array
   CT scanners from two commercial manufacturers (LightSpeed VCT, GE
   Healthcare; SOMATOM Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare). A
   previously-validated Monte Carlo program was used to simulate organ dose
   for each patient model and each scanner, from which
   DLP-normalized-effective dose (k factor) and DLP-normalized-risk index
   values (q factor) were derived. The k factor showed exponential decrease
   with increasing patient size. For a given gender, q factor showed
   exponential decrease with both increasing patient size and patient age.
   The discrepancies in k and q factors across scanners were on average 8\%

Abstract = {{In this study, an extension of linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control
   theory is used to determine the optimal state feedback controller for a
   nonlinear energy harvesting system that is driven by a stochastic
   disturbance. Specifically, the energy harvester is a base-excited
   single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) resonant oscillator with an
   electromagnetic transducer embedded between the ground and moving mass.
   The electromagnetic transducer used to harvest energy from the SDOF
   oscillator introduces a nonlinear Coulomb friction force into the
   system, which must be accounted for in the design of the controller. As
   such, the development of the optimal controller for this system is based
   on statistical linearization, whereby the Coulomb friction force is
   replaced by an equivalent linear viscous damping term, which is
   calculated from the stationary covariance of the closed-loop system. It
   is shown that the covariance matrix and optimal feedback gain matrix can
   be computed by implementing an iterative algorithm involving linear
   matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation results are presented for the
   SDOF energy harvester in which the performance of the optimal state
   feedback control law is compared to the performance of the optimal
   static admittance over a range of disturbance bandwidths.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a novel weighting for the interfacial
   consistency terms arising in a Nitsche variational form. We demonstrate
   through numerical analysis and extensive numerical evidence that the
   choice of the weighting parameter has a great bearing on the stability
   of the method. Consequently, we propose a weighting that results in an
   estimate for the stabilization parameter such that the method remains
   well behaved in varied settings: ranging from the configuration of
   embedded interfaces resulting in arbitrarily small elements to such
   cases where a large contrast in material properties exists. An important
   consequence of this weighting is that the bulk as well as the
   interfacial fields remain well behaved in the presence of (a) elements
   with arbitrarily small volume fractions, (b) large material
   heterogeneities and (c) both large heterogeneities as well as
   arbitrarily small elements. We then highlight the accuracy and

Abstract = {{Multifunctional Janus particles have a variety of applications in a wide
   range of fields. However, to achieve many of these applications,
   high-throughput, low-cost techniques are needed to synthesize these
   particles with precise control of the various
   structural/physical/chemical properties. Microfluidics provides a unique
   platform to fabricate Janus particles using carefully controlled liquid
   flow in microfluidic channels to form Janus droplets and various types
   of solidification methods to solidify them into Janus particles. In this
   Focus article, we summarize the most recent representative works on
   Janus particle fabrication in microfluidics. The applications of Janus
   particles in biomedical areas are emphasized. We believe that
   microfluidics-enabled multifunctional Janus particles could resolve
   multiple prevalent issues in biomedicine (e.g., disease monitoring at an
   early stage, high-throughput bioassays, therapeutic delivery) if
   persistent effort and collaboration are devoted to this direction.}},

Abstract = {{Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), a link state routing protocol, is a
   popular interior gateway protocol (IGP) in the Internet. Wide spread
   deployment and years of experience running the protocol have motivated
   continuous improvements in its operation as the nature and demands of
   the routing infrastructures have changed. Modern routing domains need to
   maintain a very high level of service availability. Hence, OSPF needs to
   achieve fast convergence to topology changes. Also, the ever-growing
   size of routing domains, and possible presence of wireless mobile adhoc
   network (MANET) components, requires highly scalable operation on part
   of OSPF to avoid routing instability. Recent years have seen significant
   efforts aimed at improving OSPF's convergence speed as well as
   scalability and extending OSPF to achieve seamless integration of mobile
   adhoc networks with conventional wired networks. In this paper, we
   present a comprehensive survey of these efforts.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{320-336}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Mild hyperthermia (40-45 degrees C) is a proven adjuvant for
   radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance guided high intensity
   focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) can non-invasively heat solid tumours under
   image guidance. Low temperature-sensitive liposomes (LTSLs) release
   their drug cargo in response to heat (>40 degrees C) and may improve
   drug delivery to solid tumours when combined with mild hyperthermia. The
   objective of this study was to develop and implement a clinically
   relevant MR-HIFU mild hyperthermia heating algorithm for combination
   with LTSLs.
   Materials and methods: Sonications were performed with a clinical
   MR-HIFU platform in a phantom and rabbits bearing VX2 tumours (target =
   4-16 mm). A binary control algorithm was used for real-time mild
   hyperthermia feedback control (target = 40-41 degrees C). Drug delivery
   with LTSLs was measured with HPLC. Data were compared to simulation
   results and analysed for spatial targeting accuracy (offset),
   temperature accuracy (mean), homogeneity of heating (standard deviation
   (SD), T10 and T90), and thermal dose (CEM43).
   Results: Sonications in a phantom resulted in better temperature control
   than in vivo. Sonications in VX2 tumours resulted in mean temperatures
   between 40.4 degrees C and 41.3 degrees C with a SD of 1.0-1.5 degrees C
   (T10 = 41.7-43.7 degrees C, T90 = 39.0-39.6 degrees C), in agreement
   with simulations. 3D spatial offset was 0.1-3.2mm in vitro and 0.6-4.8mm
   in vivo. Combination of MR-HIFU hyperthermia and LTSLs demonstrated
   heterogeneous delivery to a partially heated VX2 tumour, as expected.
   Conclusions: An MR-HIFU mild hyperthermia heating algorithm was
   developed, resulting in accurate and homogeneous heating within the
   targeted region in vitro and in vivo, which is suitable for applications
   in drug delivery.}},

Title = {{Targeted drug delivery by high intensity focused ultrasound mediated
   hyperthermia combined with temperature-sensitive liposomes:
   Computational modelling and preliminary in vivo validation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{337-348}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and validate a computational model that simulates 1)
   tissue heating with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and 2)
   resulting hyperthermia-mediated drug delivery from temperature-sensitive
   liposomes (TSL).
   Materials and methods: HIFU heating in tissue was simulated using a heat
   transfer model based on the bioheat equation, including heat-induced
   cessation of perfusion. A spatio-temporal multi-compartment
   pharmacokinetic model simulated intravascular release of doxorubicin
   from TSL, its transport into interstitium, and cell uptake. Two heating
   schedules were simulated, each lasting 30 min: 1) hyperthermia at 43
   degrees C (HT) and 2) hyperthermia followed by a high temperature (50
   degrees C for 20 s) pulse (HT+). As preliminary model validation, in
   vivo studies were performed in thigh muscle of a New Zealand White
   rabbit, where local hyperthermia with a clinical magnetic
   resonance-guided HIFU system was applied following TSL administration.
   Results: HT produced a defined region of high doxorubicin concentration
   (cellular concentration similar to 15-23 mu g/g) in the target region.
   Cellular drug uptake was directly related to HT duration, with
   increasing doxorubicin uptake up to similar to 2h. HT+ enhanced drug
   delivery by similar to 40\% compared to HT alone. Temperature difference
   between model and experiment within the hyperthermia zone was on average
   0.54 degrees C. Doxorubicin concentration profile agreed qualitatively
   with in vivo fluorescence profile.
   Conclusions: Computational models can predict temperature and delivered
   drug from combination of HIFU with TSL. Drug delivery using TSL may be
   enhanced by prolonged hyperthermia up to 2 h or by local cessation of
   vascular perfusion with a high temperature pulse following hyperthermia.}},

   of a system tends to be optimistic since it ignores the failure repair

   captured by only two states (functioning or failed). To analyze the
   degradation of a system's performance in consideration with availability
   metrics, combined measures of performance and availability are

Title = {{Effects of Meandering on Dipole Antenna Resonant Frequency}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{122-125}},
Abstract = {{In low-frequency applications, antenna designers find that it is
   beneficial to adjust the resonant frequency while preferably maintaining
   the physical size as a means of improving the antenna's radiation
   resistance, which in turn improves the radiation efficiency. The closer
   the resonant frequency is to the frequency of operation, the more
   efficient the antenna is. Addition of bends is one such technique for
   increasing the electrical size of a dipole antenna while maintaining the
   same overall physical length. This letter presents a study of the
   effects of bends on the resonant frequency of a dipole antenna in the
   VHF frequency range. A broadband equivalent circuit model for a straight
   dipole from previous work is adapted to a three-bend meander dipole
   antenna, and its performance is compared to that of a straight dipole
   having the same overall physical length. The predicted frequency
   response of the broadband model is calculated using circuit simulation
   software and compared to results from computational electromagnetic
   modeling and network-analyzer measurement of prototype straight and
   meandered dipole antennas.}},

Title = {{Ultrawideband Impulse Radar Through-the-Wall Imaging with Compressive
   Sensing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Compressive Sensing (CS) provides a new perspective for addressing radar
   applications requiring large amount of measurements and long data
   acquisition time; both issues are inherent in through-the-wall radar
   imaging (TWRI). Most CS techniques applied to TWRI consider
   stepped-frequency radar platforms. In this paper, the impulse radar
   two-dimensional (2D) TWRI problem is cast within the framework of CS and
   solved by the sparse constraint optimization performed on time-domain
   samples. Instead of the direct sampling of the time domain signal at the
   Nyquist rate, the Random Modulation Preintegration architecture is
   employed for the CS projection measurement, which significantly reduces
   the amount of measurement data for TWRI. Numerical results for
   point-like and spatially extended targets show that high-quality
   reliable TWRI based on the CS imaging approach can be achieved with a

Abstract = {{The present work describes the biofiltration of mixture of n-propanol
   (as a model hydrophilic volatile organic compound (VOC)) and toluene (as
   a model hydrophobic VOC) in a biofilter packed with a compost-woodchip
   mixture. Initially, the biofilter was fed with toluene vapours at
   loadings up to 175 g m(-3) h(-1) and removal efficiencies of 70\%-99\%
   were observed. The biofilter performance when removing mixtures of
   toluene and n-propanol reached elimination capacities of up to 67
   g(toluene) m(-3) h(-1) and 85 g(n-propanol) m(-3) h(-1) with removal
   efficiencies of 70\%-100\% for toluene and essentially 100\% for
   n-propanol. The presence of high n-propanol loading negatively affected
   the toluene removal; however, n-propanol removal was not affected by the
   presence of toluene and was effectively removed in the biofilter despite
   high toluene loadings. A model for toluene and n-propanol biofiltration
   could predict the cross-inhibition effect of n-propanol on toluene
   removal.}},

Abstract = {{There are many nonlinear systems used in engineering which require
   damage detection. For such systems, nonlinear damage detection methods
   may be useful. In this paper, a novel method is introduced that uses
   limit cycle oscillations that arise once the bifurcation (flutter)
   boundary is exceeded and shows greater sensitivity for damage detection
   versus linear damage detection techniques. Another advantage of this
   method is that it can be used for health monitoring of linear or
   nonlinear systems. Here a nonlinear aeroelastic panel is considered as a
   model to show the capabilities of the proposed damage detection
   technique. Also Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is used to find the
   number of independent damage locations in the panel.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{452}},
Pages = {{63-80}},
Abstract = {{To assess krill aggregations and humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae
   foraging behavior, spatial and temporal relationships between Antarctic
   krill Euphausia superba and zooplankton taxonomic groups were studied
   during an interdisciplinary cruise conducted in May and June 2009 within
   Wilhelmina Bay on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. A
   vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a calibrated
   EK-60 echo sounder were used to assess circulation patterns and krill
   distributions in the bay, and a multiple opening and closing net (with
   333 mu m mesh) and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS) was used to
   collect live samples of mesozooplankton and krill for taxonomic
   composition analysis. The results from this field study complement a
   previous one that examined an anticyclonic bay-scale circulation of
   Antarctic krill. This super-aggregation of krill covered similar to 100
   km(2), had a concentration of 1000s of individuals m(-2) and was
   associated with more than 306 humpback whales present in Wilhelmina Bay.
   Our results from the mesozooplankton study revealed that krill
   continuously conducted diel vertical migrations and formed aggregations
   in the inner bay, while the chlorophyll concentration at the surface
   decreased from 2.2 to 0.6 g C m(-2) due to the decrease of daylight, and
   zooplankton concentrations increased from 0.5 to 1.5 g C m(-2) probably
   from advective influx. Most zooplankton were distributed below 200 m
   while krill fed in the upper 150 m. The spatial and temporal
   correlations between krill and small-to medium-sized mesozooplankton
   imply that krill may become omnivorous when there is a lack of
   phytoplankton in the late austral fall. Though both phytoplankton and
   zooplankton biomasses contributed only small fractions of the daily
   ration needed for krill metabolism in Wilhelmina Bay, it is not clear
   what caused krill to aggregate on such a large scale, as this led to
   high mortality as a result of starvation and predation by whales and
   other top predators.}},

Title = {{Simplified CSP analysis of a stiff stochastic ODE system}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {{121-138}},
Abstract = {{We develop a simplified computational singular perturbation (CSP)
   analysis of a stochastic dynamical system. We focus on the case of
   parametric uncertainty, and rely on polynomial chaos (PC)
   representations to quantify its impact. We restrict our attention to a
   system that exhibits distinct timescales, and that tends to a
   deterministic steady state irrespective of the random inputs. A detailed
   analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stochastic system
   Jacobian is conducted, which provides a relationship between the PC
   representation of the stochastic Jacobian and the Jacobian of the
   Galerkin form of the stochastic system. The analysis is then used to
   guide the application of a simplified CSP formalism that is based on
   relating the slow and fast manifolds of the uncertain system to those of
   a nominal deterministic system. Two approaches are specifically
   developed with the resulting simplified CSP framework. The first uses
   the stochastic eigenvectors of the uncertain system as CSP vectors,
   whereas the second uses the eigenvectors of the nominal system as CSP
   vectors. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the results
   of the stochastic eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis, and illustrate
   the effectiveness of the simplified CSP algorithms in addressing the
   stiffness of the system dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Characterization of Meander Dipole Antennas With a Geometry-Based,
   Frequency-Independent Lumped Element Model}},
Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{346-349}},
Abstract = {{Meander antennas have gained widespread use in applications such as
   radio frequency identification (RFID) devices where space for the
   antenna is limited or a low-frequency operation is required. Several
   size-reduction and synthesis methods have been proposed over time.
   However, few studies have focused on developing models to characterize
   the operation of meander antennas. In addition, existing models are
   frequency-dependent, which means that they are inherently narrowband. An
   alternative model that is based entirely on the geometry of a meander
   dipole antenna (MDA) and is frequency-independent is proposed. To
   enhance the accuracy of the proposed model, the effect of mutual
   capacitances introduced through bending of the antenna wire is
   incorporated. The mutual capacitances are also a function of the antenna
   geometry. This model is expected to be more broadband relative to
   existing models. The equivalent circuit model proposed is validated
   through comparison to numerical simulations in EMCoS, a
   moment-method-based software package. The discrepancies between
   predictions of the resonant frequencies of MDAs with our model and
   simulation results are found to be less than 3\%. Two classes of meander
   dipole antennas are introduced.}},

Title = {{Biomimetic three-dimensional nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and
   magnetically synthesized single-walled carbon nanotube chitosan
   nanocomposite for bone regeneration}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{2087-2099}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many shortcomings exist in the traditional methods of
   treating bone defects, such as donor tissue shortages for autografts and
   disease transmission for allografts. The objective of this study was to
   design a novel three-dimensional nanostructured bone substitute based on
   magnetically synthesized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT),
   biomimetic hydrothermally treated nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite, and a
   biocompatible hydrogel (chitosan). Both nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite
   and SWCNT have a biomimetic nanostructure, excellent osteoconductivity,
   and high potential to improve the load-bearing capacity of hydrogels.
   Methods: Specifically, three-dimensional porous chitosan scaffolds with
   different concentrations of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and SWCNT
   were created to support the growth of human osteoblasts (bone-forming
   cells) using a lyophilization procedure. Two types of SWCNT were
   synthesized in an arc discharge with a magnetic field (B-SWCNT) and
   without a magnetic field (N-SWCNT) for improving bone regeneration.
   Results: Nanocomposites containing magnetically synthesized B-SWCNT had
   superior cytocompatibility properties when compared with nonmagnetically
   synthesized N-SWCNT. B-SWCNT have much smaller diameters and are twice
   as long as their nonmagnetically prepared counterparts, indicating that
   the dimensions of carbon nanotubes can have a substantial effect on
   osteoblast attachment.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a chitosan nanocomposite with
   both B-SWCNT and 20\% nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite could achieve a
   higher osteoblast density when compared with the other experimental
   groups, thus making this nanocomposite promising for further exploration
   for bone regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of dermatologists and pathologists are concerned that
   the rapidly rising incidence of melanoma reflects not a true `epidemic'
   but an increasing tendency to overdiagnose pigmented lesions. Addressing
   this problem requires both a better understanding of early-stage
   melanoma and new diagnostic criteria based on more than just cellular
   morphology and architecture. Here we present a method for in-vivo
   optical microscopy that utilizes pump-probe spectroscopy to image the
   distribution of the two forms of melanin in skin: eumelanin and
   pheomelanin. Images are acquired in a scanning microscope with a
   sensitive modulation transfer technique by analyzing back-scattered
   probe light with a lock-in amplifier. Early-stage melanoma is studied in
   a human skin xenografted mouse model. Individual melanocytes have been
   observed, in addition to pigmented keratinocytes. Combining the
   pump-probe images simultaneously with other noninvasive laser microscopy
   methods (confocal reflectance, multiphoton autofluorescence, and second
   harmonic generation) allows visualization of the skin architecture,
   framing the functional pump-probe image in the context of the
   surrounding tissue morphology. It is found that pump-probe images of
   melanin can be acquired with low peak intensities, enabling wide
   field-of-view pigmentation surveys. Finally, we investigate the
   diagnostic potential of the additional chemical information available
   from pump-probe microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Graded index polymer films enable novel optics using rigid or flexible
   substrates, such as waveguides or anti-reflection coatings. Previously,
   such films have been fabricated by nanoimprint lithography or the
   decomposition of a single component in polymer blends. Yet, it is
   desirable to have precise control over the polymer film composition in
   order to have the most flexibility in designing refractive index
   profiles. Resonant-infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation
   (RIR-MAPLE) is a polymer thin film deposition technique that enables
   multi-layer structures on a wide variety of substrate materials,
   regardless of the solubilities of constituent polymers. In this work,
   the feasibility of tuning the refractive index of blended polymer films
   of polystyrene and poly( methyl methacrylate) deposited by RIR-MAPLE is
   demonstrated. Different polymer blend film compositions are deposited
   using RIR-MAPLE by varying the polymer target ratio. Transmission
   electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy are used to characterize
   the film morphology.}},

Abstract = {{We have applied wide-field digital interferometric techniques to
   quantitatively image sickle red blood cells (RBCs) {[}1] in a noncontact
   label-free manner, and measure the nanometer-scale fluctuations in their
   thickness as an indication of their stiffness. The technique can
   simultaneously measure the fluctuations for multiple spatial points on
   the RBC and thus yields a map describing the stiffness of each RBC in
   the field of view. Using this map, the local rigidity regions of the RBC
   are evaluated quantitatively. Since wide-field digital interferometry is
   a quantitative holographic imaging technique rather than one-point
   measurement, it can be used to simultaneously evaluate cell transverse
   morphology plus thickness in addition to its stiffness profile. Using
   this technique, we examine the morphology and dynamics of RBCs from
   individuals who suffer from sickle cell disease, and find that the
   sickle RBCs are significantly stiffer than healthy RBCs. Furthermore, we
   show that the technique is sensitive enough to distinguish various
   classes of sickle RBCs, including sickle RBCs with visibly-normal
   morphology, compared to the stiffer crescent-shaped sickle RBCs.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy has been previously explored as a
   promising method for providing real-time visual maps of tissue
   composition to help surgeons determine breast lumpectomy margins and to
   ensure the complete removal of a tumor during surgery. We present the
   simple design, validation, and implementation of a compact and
   cost-effective spectral imaging system for the application of tumor
   margin assessment. Our new system consists of a broadband source with
   bandpass filters for illumination and a fabricated custom 16-pixel
   photodiode imaging array for the detection of diffuse reflectance. The
   system prototype was characterized in tissue-mimicking phantoms and has
   an SNR of greater than 40 dB in phantoms, animals, and human tissue. We
   show proof-of-concept for performing fast, wide-field spectral imaging
   with a simple, inexpensive design. The strategy also allows for the
   scaling to higher pixel number and density in future iterations of the
   system.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a novel label-free approach referred to as plasmonic
   coupling interference (PCI) nanoprobes for nucleic acid detection using
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). To induce a strong plasmonic
   coupling effect and SERS signal, a nano-network of silver nanoparticles
   having the Raman label located between adjacent nanoparticles is
   assembled by Raman-labeled nucleic acid duplexes. The PCI method then
   utilizes specific nucleic acid sequences of interest as competitor
   elements of the Raman-labeled DNA probes to interfere the formation of
   the nucleic acid-crosslinked nano-networks in a competitive binding
   process, resulting in a reduced SERS signal. We illustrate the potential
   of the PCI technique for biomedical applications by detecting
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and microRNA sequences involved in
   breast cancers. The results of this study could lead to the development
   of nucleic acid diagnostic tools for biomedical diagnostics and

Abstract = {{The past years have witnessed remarkable advances in our use of atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) for stretching single biomolecules, thereby
   contributing to answering many outstanding questions in biophysics and
   chemical biology. In these single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS)
   experiments, the AFM tip is continuously approached to and retracted
   from the biological sample, while monitoring the interaction force. The
   obtained force-extension curves provide key insight into the molecular
   elasticity and localization of single molecules, either on isolated
   systems or on cellular surfaces. In this tutorial review, we describe
   the principle of such SMFS experiments, and we survey remarkable
   breakthroughs made in manipulating single polysaccharides and proteins,
   including understanding the conformational properties of sugars and
   controlling them by force, measuring the molecular elasticity of
   mechanical proteins, unfolding and refolding individual proteins,
   probing protein-ligand interactions, and tuning enzymatic reactions by
   force. In addition, we show how SMFS with AFM tips bearing specific
   bioligands has enabled researchers to stretch and localize single

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To automatically segment retinal spectral domain optical
   coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images of eyes with age-related macular
   degeneration (AMD) and various levels of image quality to advance the
   study of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)+drusen complex (RPEDC) volume
   changes indicative of AMD progression.
   METHODS. A general segmentation framework based on graph theory and
   dynamic programming was used to segment three retinal boundaries in
   SD-OCT images of eyes with drusen and geographic atrophy (GA). A
   validation study for eyes with nonneovascular AMD was conducted, forming
   subgroups based on scan quality and presence of GA. To test for
   accuracy, the layer thickness results from two certified graders were
   compared against automatic segmentation results for 220 B-scans across
   20 patients. For reproducibility, automatic layer volumes were compared
   that were generated from 0 degrees versus 90 degrees scans in five
   volumes with drusen.
   RESULTS. The mean differences in the measured thicknesses of the total
   retina and RPEDC layers were 4.2 +/- 2.8 and 3.2 +/- 2.6 mu m for
   automatic versus manual segmentation. When the 0 degrees and 90 degrees
   datasets were compared, the mean differences in the calculated total
   retina and RPEDC volumes were 0.28\% +/- 0.28\% and 1.60\% +/- 1.57\%,
   respectively. The average segmentation time per image was 1.7 seconds
   automatically versus 3.5 minutes manually.
   CONCLUSIONS. The automatic algorithm accurately and reproducibly
   segmented three retinal boundaries in images containing drusen and GA.
   This automatic approach can reduce time and labor costs and yield
   objective measurements that potentially reveal quantitative RPE changes
   in longitudinal clinical AMD studies. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,

Abstract = {{We present a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) system design that
   employs coherence revival-based heterodyning and polarization encoding
   to simultaneously image the ocular anterior segment and the retina.
   Coherence revival heterodyning allows for multiple depths within a
   sample to be simultaneously imaged and frequency encoded by carefully
   controlling the optical pathlength of each sample path. A
   polarization-encoded sample arm was used to direct orthogonal
   polarizations to the anterior segment and retina. This design is a
   significant step toward realizing whole-eye OCT, which would enable
   customized ray-traced modeling of patient eyes to improve refractive
   surgical interventions, as well as the elimination of optical artifacts
   in retinal OCT diagnostics. We demonstrated the feasibility of this
   system by acquiring images of the anterior segments and retinas of
   healthy human volunteers.}},

Abstract = {{The plasmonic modes of a nano-antenna formed by a nanoparticle/thin film
   hybrid system are investigated. Plasmonic nano-antennas are well-known
   for their capabilities to concentrate electromagnetic wave into extreme
   small region and couple the emission from active materials in proximity
   to the antennas into far-field region. Previously, we have shown through
   direct measurement of emission profile images that the nano-antennas not
   only enhance Raman emission but also systematically direct inelastic
   emission to the far-field through the dipole mode. We also showed that
   high order modes of the hybrid structure can be detected. Here, the
   higher order plasmonic modes are further characterized through
   simulations of spectrum and scattering profile. Through spectral
   simulation with improved resolution, two distinct modes are found to
   contribute to the broad band high order mode. One has dipole-like
   behavior and the other has quadrupole-like behavior. The modes are
   characterized both through near-field distribution and far-field
   scattering profiles. The quadrupole-like mode can be excited by both p-
   and s-polarized light whereas the dipole-like mode is only excited by
   p-polarized light. These high order modes are not as bright as the
   dipole mode in the far-field spectrum but have substantial near field
   enhancement which can be utilized for surface-enhancing spectroscopy and
   sensing. In addition, characterization of high order modes may serve to
   clarify the interaction between nano-antenna and active materials and
   will lead to design rules for applications of active plasmonic
   structures in integrated optical circuits.}},

Title = {{Dictionary Learning for Noisy and Incomplete Hyperspectral Images}},

Pages = {{33-56}},
Abstract = {{We consider analysis of noisy and incomplete hyperspectral imagery, with
   the objective of removing the noise and inferring the missing data. The
   noise statistics may be wavelength dependent, and the fraction of data
   missing (at random) may be substantial, including potentially entire
   bands, offering the potential to significantly reduce the quantity of
   data that need be measured. To achieve this objective, the imagery is
   divided into contiguous three-dimensional (3D) spatio-spectral blocks of
   spatial dimension much less than the image dimension. It is assumed that
   each such 3D block may be represented as a linear combination of
   dictionary elements of the same dimension, plus noise, and the
   dictionary elements are learned in situ based on the observed data (no a
   priori training). The number of dictionary elements needed for
   representation of any particular block is typically small relative to
   the block dimensions, and all the image blocks are processed jointly
   ({''}collaboratively{''}) to infer the underlying dictionary. We address
   dictionary learning from a Bayesian perspective, considering two
   distinct means of imposing sparse dictionary usage. These models allow
   inference of the number of dictionary elements needed as well as the
   underlying wavelength-dependent noise statistics. It is demonstrated
   that drawing the dictionary elements from a Gaussian process prior,
   imposing structure on the wavelength dependence of the dictionary
   elements, yields significant advantages, relative to the more
   conventional approach of using an independent and identically
   distributed Gaussian prior for the dictionary elements; this advantage
   is particularly evident in the presence of noise. The framework is
   demonstrated by processing hyperspectral imagery with a significant
   number of voxels missing uniformly at random, with imagery at specific
   wavelengths missing entirely, and in the presence of substantial
   additive noise.}},

   a Wind Tunnel}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation is an important sink for atmospheric ultrafine particles
   (UFP). Prediction of UFP deposition to vegetation, however, is still
   problematic. In this study, we have investigated size-dependent removal
   of UFP by two conifer species: pine and juniper. The experiments were
   performed by placing freshly cut branches into a wind tunnel and
   measuring UFP size distributions upstream and downstream of the
   branches. Five air velocities ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 m/s, two packing
   densities (volume fraction occupied by the branches) and two branch
   orientations were tested to assess their effect on particle removal. The
   UFP removal efficiency was found to decrease with increasing particle
   size, increasing wind speed, and decreasing packing density. The branch
   orientation did not affect the removal efficiency within the uncertainty
   of the measurements. To facilitate extrapolation of the measurement
   results to real-life conditions, we have tested the applicability of
   filtration theory to particle removal by vegetation branches. The
   filtration theory predictions agreed well with the experimental data.
   The representative effective fiber diameter derived from the
   experimental data was found to be 0.054 (+/- 0.001) cm and 0.065 (+/-
   0.001) cm for pine and juniper, respectively. For pine, the derived
   effective diameters were very close to the physical diameter of pine
   needles. In accordance with the filtration theory, the removal
   efficiency was found to be correlated with the pressure drop across the
   vegetation branches. This finding suggests that the UFP removal can be
   linked to aerodynamic properties of vegetative barriers, such as their
   drag coefficient. This could potentially facilitate modeling of UFP
   removal and dispersion by vegetative barriers using fluid dynamics
   models. The applicability}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a newly developed light spot hydrophone (LSHD) in
   lithotripter field characterization was compared to that of the fiber
   optic probe hydrophone (FOPH). Pressure waveforms produced by a stable
   electromagnetic shock wave source were measured by the LSHD and FOPH
   under identical experimental conditions. In the low energy regime, focus
   and field acoustic parameters matched well between the two hydrophones.
   At clinically relevant high energy settings for shock wave lithotripsy,
   the measured leading compressive pressure waveforms matched closely with
   each other. However, the LSHD recorded slightly larger IP\_1 (p < 0.05)
   and secondary peak compressive pressures (p < 0.01) than the FOPH,
   leading to about 20\% increase in total acoustic pulse energy calculated
   in a 6 mm radius around the focus (p = 0.06). Tensile pulse durations
   deviated similar to 5\% (p < 0.01) due to tensile wave shortening from
   cavitation activity using the LSHD. Intermittent compression spikes and
   laser light reflection artifacts have been correlated to bubble activity
   based on simultaneous high-speed imaging analysis. Altogether, both
   hydrophones are adequate for lithotripter field characterization as
