Abstract = {{Rationale: Generation of induced cardiac myocytes (iCMs) directly from
   fibroblasts offers great opportunities for cardiac disease modeling and
   cardiac regeneration. A major challenge of iCM generation is the low
   conversion rate of fibroblasts to fully reprogrammed iCMs, which could
   in part be attributed to unbalanced expression of reprogramming factors
   Gata4 (G), Mef2c (M), and Tbx5 (T) using the current gene delivery
   approach.
   Objective: We aimed to establish a system to express distinct ratios of
   G, M, T proteins in fibroblasts and determine the effect of G, M, T
   stoichiometry on iCM reprogramming.
   Methods and Results: We took advantage of the inherent feature of the
   polycistronic system and generated all possible combinations of G, M, T
   with identical 2A sequences in a single transgene. We demonstrated that
   each splicing order of G, M, T gave rise to distinct G, M, T protein
   expression levels. Combinations that resulted in higher protein level of
   Mef2c with lower levels of Gata4 and Tbx5 significantly enhanced
   reprogramming efficiency compared with separate G, M, T transduction.
   Importantly, after further optimization, the MGT vector resulted in more
   than 10-fold increase in the number of mature beating iCM loci.
   Molecular characterization revealed that more optimal G, M, T
   stoichiometry correlated with higher expression of mature cardiac
   myocyte markers.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that stoichiometry of G, M, T
   protein expression influences the efficiency and quality of iCM
   reprogramming. The established optimal G, M, T expression condition will
   provide a valuable platform for future iCM studies.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of polymer-drug conjugates from prodrug monomers
   consisting of a cyclic polymerizable group that is appended to a drug
   through a cleavable linker is achieved by organocatalyzed ring-opening
   polymerization. The monomers polymerize into well-defined polymer
   pro-drugs that are designed to self-assemble into nanoparticles and
   release the drug in response to a physiologically relevant stimulus.
   This method is compatible with structurally diverse drugs and allows
   different drugs to be copolymerized with quantitative conversion of the
   monomers. The drug loading can be controlled by adjusting the
   monomer(s)/initiator feed ratio and drug release can be encoded into the
   polymer by the choice of linker. Initiating these monomers from a
   poly(ethylene glycol) macroinitiator results in amphiphilic diblock
   copolymers that spontaneously self-assemble into micelles with a long
   plasma circulation, which is useful for systemic therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Existing in vitro models of human skeletal muscle cannot recapitulate
   the organization and function of native muscle, limiting their use in
   physiological and pharmacological studies. Here, we demonstrate
   engineering of electrically and chemically responsive, contractile human
   muscle tissues ({''}myobundles{''}) using primary myogenic cells. These
   biomimetic constructs exhibit aligned architecture, multinucleated and
   striated myofibers, and a Pax7(+) cell pool. They contract spontaneously
   and respond to electrical stimuli with twitch and tetanic contractions.
   Positive correlation between contractile force and GCaMP6-reported
   calcium responses enables non-invasive tracking of myobundle function
   and drug response. During culture, myobundles maintain functional
   acetylcholine receptors and structurally and functionally mature,
   evidenced by increased myofiber diameter and improved calcium handling
   and contractile strength. In response to diversely acting drugs,
   myobundles undergo dose-dependent hypertrophy or toxic myopathy similar
   to clinical outcomes. Human myobundles provide an enabling platform for
   predictive drug and toxicology screening and development of novel

Abstract = {{We provide the first demonstration that isopeptide ligation, a
   noncanonical activity of the enzyme sortaseA, can be used to modify
   recombinant proteins. This reaction was used invitro to conjugate small
   molecules to a peptide, an engineered targeting protein, and a
   full-length monoclonal antibody with an exquisite level of control over
   the site of conjugation. Attachment to the protein substrate occurred
   exclusively through isopeptide bonds at a lysine epsilon-amino group
   within a specific amino acid sequence. This reaction allows more than
   one molecule to be site-specifically conjugated to a protein at internal
   sites, thereby overcoming significant limitations of the canonical
   native peptide ligation reaction catalyzed by sortaseA. Our method
   provides a unique chemical ligation procedure that is orthogonal to
   existing methods, supplying a new method to site-specifically modify
   lysine residues that will be a valuable addition to the protein
   conjugation toolbox.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{An important environmental application of pattern control by periodic
   spatial forcing is the restoration of vegetation patterns in
   water-limited ecosystems that went through desertification. Vegetation
   restoration is often based on periodic landscape modulations that
   intercept overland water flow and form favorable conditions for
   vegetation growth. Viewing this method as a spatial resonance problem,
   we show that plain realizations of this method, assuming a complete
   vegetation response to the imposed modulation pattern, suffer from poor
   resilience to rainfall variability. By contrast, less intuitive
   realizations, based on the inherent spatial modes of vegetation growth
   and involving partial vegetation implantation, can be highly resilient
   and equally productive. We derive these results using two complementary
   models, a realistic vegetation model, and a simple pattern formation
   model that lends itself to mathematical analysis and highlights the
   universal aspects of the behaviors found with the vegetation model. We
   focus on reversing desertification as an outstanding environmental
   problem, but the main conclusions hold for any spatially forced system
   near the onset of a finite-wave-number instability that is subjected to
   noisy conditions.}},

   show that for a sufficiently noisy environment, the functional fixed
   point equation leads to a contraction mapping, and hence, its iterations
   converge to a unique continuous threshold policy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a multiscale approach to spectrum sensing in cognitive
   cellular networks is analyzed. Observing that wireless interference
   decays with distance, and that estimating the entire spectrum occupancy
   across the network entails substantial energy cost and communication
   overhead, a protocol for distributed spectrum estimation is defined by
   which secondary users maintain fine-grained estimates of the spectrum
   occupancy of nearby cells, but coarse-grained estimates of that of
   distant cells. This is accomplished by arranging the cellular network
   into a hierarchy of increasingly coarser macro-cells and having
   secondary users fuse local spectrum estimates up the hierarchy. The
   spectrum occupancy is modeled as a Markov process, and the system is
   optimized by defining a probabilistic framework for spectrum sensing and
   information exchange that balances improvements in spectrum estimation
   against energy costs. The performance of the multiscale scheme is
   evaluated numerically, showing that it offers substantial improvements
   in energy efficiency over local estimation. On the other hand, it is
   shown that schemes that attempt to estimate the state of the whole
   network perform poorly, due to the excessive cost of performing
   information exchange with far away cells, and to the fact that, knowing
   the spectrum occupancy of distant cells, which experience low
   interference levels, results in a small increase in reward.}},

Abstract = {{We study the excess mean square error (EMSE) above the minimum mean
   square error (MMSE) in large linear systems where the posterior mean
   estimator (PME) is evaluated with a postulated prior that differs from
   the true prior of the input signal. We focus on large linear systems
   where the measurements are acquired via an independent and identically
   distributed random matrix, and are corrupted by additive white Gaussian
   noise (AWGN). The relationship between the EMSE in large linear systems
   and EMSE in scalar channels is derived, and closed form approximations
   are provided. Our analysis is based on the decoupling principle, which
   links scalar channels to large linear system analyses. Numerical
   examples demonstrate that our closed form approximations are accurate.}},

   transition of the misclassification probability and the reconstruction
   error in the low-noise regime. These conditions, which are reminiscent
   of the well-known Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv conditions, are a function
   of the number of measurements taken from the signal of interest, the
   number of measurements taken from the side information signal, and the

Abstract = {{Arikan introduced polar codes in 2009 and proved that they achieve the
   symmetric capacity, under low-complexity successive cancellation
   decoding, of any binary-input discrete memoryless channel. Arikan's
   construction is based on the Kronecker product of 2-by-2 matrices and it
   was extended to larger matrices by Sasoglu et al. in 2010. In this
   paper, we construct cyclic polar codes based on a mixed-radix
   Cooley-Tukey decomposition of the Galois field Fourier transform.
   Ignoring the twiddle factors between stages, the derived fast Fourier
   transform is essentially a Kronecker product of small Fourier transform
   matrices. Thus, one can define a successive cancellation decoder and
   observe that the coordinate channels polarize. Choosing the locations of
   the frozen symbols in the resulting polar code is identical to choosing
   the locations of zeros in the Fourier transform of the codewords and,
   thus, the code is cyclic.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a channel model based on the diffusion of particles in the
   medium which is motivated by the natural communication mechanisms
   between biological cells based on exchange of molecules. In this model,
   the transmitter secretes particles into the medium via a particle
   dissemination rate. The concentration of particles at any point in the
   medium is a function of its distance from the transmitter and the
   particle dissemination rate. The reception process is a doubly
   stochastic Poisson process whose rate is a function of the concentration
   of the particles in the vicinity of the receiver. We derive a
   closed-form for the mutual information between the input and output
   processes in this communication scenario and establish useful properties
   about the mutual information. We also provide a signaling strategy using
   which we derive a lower bound on the capacity of the diffusion channel
   with Poisson reception process under average and peak power constraints.
   Furthermore, it is shown that the capacity of discretized diffusion
   channel can be a negligible factor of the capacity of continuous time
   diffusion channel. Finally, the application of the considered model to
   the molecular communication systems is discussed.}},

   and theoretical analysis often relies on corresponding
   concentration-of-measure results. There are many real world applications
   involving multiple compressive measurements, from which the underlying
   signals may be estimated. In this paper, we establish a new
   concentration-of-measure inequality for a block-diagonal structured
   random compressive sensing matrix with Rademacher-ensembles. We discuss
   applications of this newly-derived inequality to two appealing
   compressive multiple measurement models: for Gaussian and Poisson
   systems. In particular, Johnson-Lindenstrauss-type results and a
   compressed-domain classification result are derived for a Gaussian
   multiple measurement model. We also propose, as another contribution,
   theoretical performance guarantees for signal recovery for
   multi-measurement Poisson systems, via the inequality.}},

Abstract = {{Guesswork forms the mathematical framework for quantifying computational

   we consider guesswork subject to a per-symbol Shannon entropy budget. We
   introduce inscrutability rate as the asymptotic rate of increase in the
   exponential number of guesses required of an adversary to determine one
   or more secret strings. We prove that the inscrutability rate of any
   string-source supported on a finite alphabet chi, if it exists, lies
   between the per-symbol Shannon entropy constraint and log vertical bar
   chi vertical bar. We further prove that the inscrutability rate of any
   finite-order Markov string-source with hidden statistics remains the
   same as the unhidden case, i.e., the asymptotic value of hiding the
   statistics per each symbol is vanishing. On the other hand, we show that
   there exists a string-source that achieves the upper limit on the
   inscrutability rate, i.e., log vertical bar chi vertical bar, under the

Abstract = {{Product codes were introduced by Elias in 1954 and generalized by Tanner
   in 1981. Recently, a number of generalized product codes have been
   proposed for forward error-correction in high-speed optical
   communication. In practice, these codes are decoded by iteratively
   decoding each of the component codes. Symmetric product codes are a
   subclass of generalized product codes that use symmetry to reduce the
   block length of a product code while using the same component code. One
   example of this subclass, dubbed half-product codes, was introduced by
   Tanner in 1981 and then generalized by Justesen in 2011. In this paper,
   we discuss some initial results on symmetric product codes. Our results
   show that: (i) these codes have a larger normalized minimum distance
   than the product code from which they are derived, (ii) some small
   constructions achieve the largest minimum distance possible for a linear
   code, and (iii) they can have better performance in both the waterfall

Abstract = {{Neural mass models provide an attractive framework for modeling complex
   behavior in cortical circuits. The models are based on describing the
   dynamics of large neural populations through the space and time
   evolution of a small number of key aggregate statistical quantities.
   Fitting these models to electrode array recordings can provide insight
   into connectivity and structure of neural circuits as well as the
   response of these circuits to stimuli. However, neural mass models are
   fundamentally nonlinear dynamical systems with large numbers of hidden
   states, and validating the models on actual recordings and estimating
   the key parameters remains challenging. This work proposes a novel
   method for systematically identifying neural mass models that is
   particularly well-suited for high-density micro-electrocorticographic
   (mu ECoG) data. The methodology requires minimal assumptions on the
   model, and can automatically uncover the underlying components in the
   neural populations We discuss possible applications to in vivo
   recordings from feline visual cortex using a recently-developed,
   high-density 360 contact flexible electrode array with 500 mu m
   inter-electrode spacing.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this article is on low-complexity capacity-achieving coding
   schemes for write-once memory (WOM) systems. The construction is based
   on spatially-coupled compound LDGM/LDPC codes. Both noiseless systems
   and systems with read errors are considered. Compound LDGM/LDPC codes
   are known to achieve capacity under MAP decoding for the closely related
   Gelfand-Pinsker problem and their coset decomposition provides an
   elegant way to encode the messages while simultaneously providing error
   protection. The application of compound codes to the WOM system is new.
   The main result is that spatial coupling enables these codes to achieve
   the capacity region of the 2-write WOM system with low-complexity
   message-passing encoding and decoding algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the context-aware filter, an estimation technique
   that incorporates context measurements, in addition to the regular
   continuous measurements. Context measurements provide binary information
   about the system's context which is not directly encoded in the state;
   examples include a robot detecting a nearby building using image
   processing or a medical device alarming that a vital sign has exceeded a
   predefined threshold. These measurements can only be received from
   certain states and can therefore be modeled as a function of the
   system's current state. We focus on two classes of functions describing
   the probability of context detection given the current state; these
   functions capture a wide variety of detections that may occur in
   practice. We derive the corresponding context-aware filters, a Gaussian
   Mixture filter and another closed-form filter with a posterior
   distribution whose moments are derived in the paper. Finally, we
   evaluate the performance of both classes of functions through simulation
   of an unmanned ground vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{Guesswork is the position at which a random string drawn from a given
   probability distribution appears in the list of strings ordered from the
   most likely to the least likely. We define the tilt operation on
   probability distributions and show that it parametrizes an exponential
   family of distributions, which we refer to as the tilted family of the
   source. We prove that two sources result in the same guesswork, i.e.,
   the same ordering from most likely to least likely on all strings, if
   and only if they belong to the same tilted family. We also prove that
   the strings whose guesswork is smaller than a given string are
   concentrated on the tilted family. Applying Laplace's method, we derive
   precise approximations on the distribution of guesswork on i.i.d.
   sources. The simulations show a good match between the approximations
   and the actual guesswork for i.i.d. sources.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the compressed sensing (CS) of i.i.d. signals with
   sparse measurement matrices and belief-propagation (BP) reconstruction.
   In general, BP reconstruction for CS requires the passing of messages
   that are distributions over the real numbers. To implement this in
   practice, one typically uses either quantized distributions or a
   Gaussian approximation. In this work, we use density evolution to
   compare the reconstruction performance of these two methods. Since the
   reconstruction performance depends on the signal realization, this
   analysis makes use of a novel change of variables to analyze the
   performance for a typical signal. Simulation results are provided to
   support the results.}},

Abstract = {{We study the impact of delayed channel state information at the
   transmitters (CSIT) in two-unicast wireless networks with a layered
   topology and arbitrary connectivity. We introduce a technique to obtain
   outer bounds to the degrees-offreedom (DoF) region through the new
   graph-theoretic notion of bottleneck nodes. Such nodes act as
   informational bottlenecks only under the assumption of delayed CSIT, and
   imply asymmetric DoF bounds of the form m D-1 + D-2 <= m. Combining this
   outer-bound technique with new achievability schemes, we characterize
   the sum DoF of a class of two-unicast wireless networks, which shows
   that, unlike in the case of instantaneous CSIT, the DoF of two-unicast
   networks with delayed CSIT can take an infinite set of values.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a full Ka-band transition from half height rectangular
   waveguide to microstrip transmission line is designed and optimized. A
   stepped impedance microstrip probe is adopted to realize good impedance
   matching. By using ANSYS HFSS simulation and optimization, the designed
   transition has insert loss < 0.25dB and return loss > 15dB during full
   Ka band. In the frequency band of 26.5 to 37GHz, insert loss is
   maintained below 0.15dB and return loss is maintained upon 20dB. This
   half height rectangular waveguide to microstrip transition not only has
   high performance but also has the advantage of much smaller size than
   conventional one, which may have potential applications in compact
   Ka-band integrated circuits and systems.}},

Abstract = {{While the notion of self-awareness has a long history in biology,
   psychology, medicine, engineering and (more recently) computing, we are
   seeing the emerging need for self-awareness in the context of complex
   Systems-on-Chip that must address the often conflicting requirements of
   performance, resiliency, energy, cost, etc. in the face of highly
   dynamic operational behaviors coupled with process, environment, and
   workload variabilities. Unlike traditional Systems-on-Chip (SoCs),
   self-aware SoCs must deploy an intelligent co-design of the control,
   communication, and computing infrastructure that interacts with the
   physical environment in real-time in order to modify the systems
   behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and
   Quality-of-Service (QoS). Self-aware SoCs require a combination of
   ubiquitous sensing and actuation, health-monitoring, and self-learning
   to enable the SoCs adaptation over time and space. This special session
   targets self-learning and self-awareness in two domains. The first one
   is a self-learning runtime reliability prediction approach by reusing
   Design-for-Test (DfT) infrastructure. The other one discusses real-time
   systems and applications to wireless communication, signal processing
   and control.}},

Abstract = {{Social infrastructure systems such as communication, transportation,
   power and water supply systems are now facing various types of threats
   including component failures, security attacks and natural disasters,
   etc. Whenever such undesirable events occur, it is crucial to recover
   the system as quickly as possible because the downtime of social
   infrastructure causes catastrophic consequences in the society. In the
   business continuity context, Recovery Time Objective (RTO) has been used
   as a criterion to specify the allowable maximum time to recover from
   system failure events. While RTO gives the requirement for system
   recovery time, performance degradation of infrastructure service during
   the recovery period is another dimension that should be taken into
   consideration. In this paper, we introduce survivability as a
   generalization of recovery behavior which can address the performance
   impacts during the recovery and show a survivability quantification
   example in a escalating and deferred repair system.}},

Abstract = {{Total variation (TV) is a widely used technique in many signal and image
   processing applications. One of the famous TV based algorithms is TV
   denoising that performs well with piecewise constant images. The same
   prior has been used also in the context of compressed sensing for
   recovering a signal from a small number of measurements. Recently, it
   has been shown that the number of measurements needed for such a
   recovery is proportional to the size of the edges in the sampled image
   and not the number of connected components in the image. In this work we
   show that this is not a coincidence and that the number of connected
   components in a piecewise constant image cannot serve alone as a measure
   for the complexity of the image. Our result is not limited only to
   images but holds also for higher dimensional signals. We believe that
   the results in this work provide a better insight into the TV prior.}},

   performance similar to a uniform frequency comb, but uses far fewer

   is a larger bandwidth extent. Co-prime comb signals consist of tones at
   non-uniformly spaced frequencies according to a 2-level nested co-prime
   array structure. Specialized non-matched filter processing enables
   recovery of an ambiguity surface similar to that of a uniform comb, but
   using fewer tonal components. This reduction in occupied bandwidth
   offers potential benefits such as sharing, interference avoidance, and
   Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvements in both peak-and
   total-power-limited scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In this testing paper, the computer-based method for analysing power
   flow and fault studies will be introduced. Specifically, a commercial
   power system analysis package IPSA+ will be introduced and used in this
   test. The objective of this testing report is to introduce the
   fundamentals of IPSA+ and the analytical methods of power flow and fault
   using IPSA+. Specifically, we design a five-step testing process to
   systematically study the implementation of IPSA+ in terms of power flow
   analysis and fault analysis. Also, manual calculated results are
   presented to compare the results produced by IPSA+ so that the accuracy
   and data processing algorithm embedded in IPSA+ could be revealed to
   some extent. By reading this paper, the readers are not only expected to
   understand how to utilize IPSA+ to carry out a series of analysis in
   power engineering, but also obtain a full picture of software-assisted
   analytical methodology in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, Cars do not have any instruments to measure the water levels
   in the washer tank of the cars. The high number of accidents relating to
   the uncleanness of the windscreen continued; In order to ensure the
   cleanness of the car windscreen, the washer tank which is used for
   storing the washing water must not be empty. The measurement of liquid
   level helped to remind drivers. Examples of liquid level detection are
   ultrasonic, hydrostatic, conductance, thermal dispersion, optics,
   magnetic floats, mechanical floats, radar and capacitance. In this
   project, a capacitive sensing system will be designed and made for the
   liquid level measurement first. Considering the contrast in permittivity
   between water and air, it was capable of detecting the presence of
   liquid in a car washer tank. Based on the design specifications, the
   Eagle will be used to build the PCB (Printed Circuit Board prototype.
   The case study is particularly useful in demonstrating the way to
   improve and developing the modern vehicles' safety and reliability

Abstract = {{A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology
   platform for revolutionizing immunoassays, clinical diagnostics, drug
   discovery, DNA sequencing, and other laboratory procedures in
   biochemistry. In most of these applications, real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) is an indispensable step for amplifying specific DNA
   segments. In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) DMFBs that integrate
   photodetectors (i.e., cyberphysical DMFBs) have been developed. They
   offer the benefits of smaller size, higher sensitivity and quicker
   time-to-results. However, current DMFB design methods target
   optimization in only two dimensions, hence they ignore the 3D two-layer
   structure of a DMFB. Moreover, these techniques ignore practical
   constraints related to the interference between on-chip device pairs,
   the performance-critical PCR thermal loop, and the physical size of
   devices. In this paper, we describe an optimization solution for a 3D
   DMFB, and present a three-stage algorithm to realize a compact 3D PCR
   chip layout, which includes: (i) PCR thermal-loop optimization; (ii) 3D
   global placement based on Strong-Push-Weak-Pull (SPWP) model; (iii)
   constraint-aware legalization. Simulation results for four laboratory
   protocols demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for the
   design and optimization of a 3D chip for real-time PCR.}},

Abstract = {{Functional fault diagnosis is necessary for board-level product
   qualification. However, ambiguous diagnosis results can lead to long
   debug times and wrong repair actions, which significantly increase
   repair cost and adversely impact yield. A state-of-the-art functional
   fault diagnosis system involves several key components: (1) design of
   functional test programs, (2) collection of functional-failure
   syndromes, (3) building of the diagnosis engine, (4) isolation of root
   causes, and (5) evaluation of the diagnosis engine. Advances in each of
   these components can pave the way for a more effective diagnosis system,
   thus improving diagnosis accuracy and reducing diagnosis time.
   Machine-learning and data analysis techniques offer an unprecedented
   opportunity to develop an automated and adaptive diagnosis system to
   increase diagnosis accuracy and reduce diagnosis time. This paper
   describes how all the above components of an advanced diagnosis system
   can benefit from machine learning and information theory. Topics
   discussed include incremental learning, decision trees, root-cause
   analysis and evaluation metrics, data acquisition, and knowledge
   transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical
   analyzers by integrating all the necessary functions for biochemical
   analysis using microfluidics. Biochips are used in many application
   areas, such as, in vitro diagnostics, drug discovery, biotech and
   ecology. The focus of this paper is on continuous-flow biochips, where
   the basic building block is a microvalve. By combining these
   microvalves, more complex units such as mixers, switches, multiplexers
   can be built, hence the name of the technology, ``microfluidic Very
   Large-Scale Integration{''} (mVLSI). A roadblock in the deployment of
   microfluidic biochips is their low reliability and lack of test
   techniques to screen defective devices before they are used for
   biochemical analysis. Defective chips lead to repetition of experiments,
   which is undesirable due to high reagent cost and limited availability
   of samples. This paper presents the state-of-the-art in the mVLSI
   platforms and emerging research challenges in the area of

Abstract = {{Bias Temperature Instability (BTI)-induced transistor aging degrades
   path delay over time and may eventually induce circuit failure due to
   timing violations. Chip health monitoring is therefore necessary to
   track delay changes on a per-chip basis. We propose a method to
   accurately predict the fine-grained circuit-delay degradation with
   minimal area and performance overhead. It re-uses on-chip
   design-for-test (DfT) infrastructure to track the severity of run-time
   stress by periodiclly capturing system state and compacting it using a
   multiple input signature register (MISR). The captured stress
   information is fed to a software-based prediction model in real-time.
   The prediction model is trained offline using support vector regression.
   Aging prediction based on run-time stress monitoring can be used to
   proactively activate aging mitigation techniques. Experimental results
   for benchmark circuits highlight the accuracy of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The subthalamic nucleus (STN) within the sub-cortical region of the
   Basal ganglia is a crucial targeting structure for Parkinson's Deep
   brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Volumetric segmentation of such small
   and complex structure, which is elusive in clinical MRI protocols, is
   thereby a pre-requisite process for reliable DBS direct targeting. While
   direct visualization of the STN is facilitated with advanced
   ultrahigh-field MR imaging (7 Tesla), such high fields are not always
   clinically available. In this paper, we aim at the automatic prediction
   of the STN region on clinical low-field MRI, exploiting dependencies
   between the STN and its adjacent structures, learned from
   ultrahigh-field MRI. We present a framework based on a statistical shape
   model to learn such shape relationship on high quality MR data sets.
   This allows for an accurate prediction and visualization of the STN
   structure, given detectable predictors on the low-field MRI.
   Experimental results on Parkinson's patients demonstrate that the
   proposed approach enables accurate estimation of the STN on clinical
   1.5T MRI.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a foam mask is introduced to elongate the beam width in
   the focal plane of a shock wave lithotripter, and a respiration gating
   beam steering strategy is proposed to accurately target stones, which
   are movable because of patient respiratory motion, radiation force,
   hydraulics, gravity, etc. The mask is steered to revolve the elongated
   elliptical focal zone of the acoustic field, so as to cover as much as
   possible the stone moving area. The beam steering strategy provides the
   most opportunity to deliver the shock wave energy straightly on the
   moving stones but not to the peripheral tissues, enhancing the stone
   fracture efficacy whilst reducing tissue injury. Simulation results with
   specific stone motion models are given to proof the advantages of the
   elongated focal zone in tracking stone target, and show that the stone
   overlap in the focal zone is improved significantly and competitively
   with the beam steering strategy, compared with no beam steering.}},

Abstract = {{Energy disaggregation algorithms decompose building-level energy data
   into device-level information. We conduct a head-to-head comparison of
   energy disaggregation techniques across multiple metrics and data sets.
   Our framework for analyzing the performance of a complete energy
   disaggregation system includes event detection, classification, and
   power assignment. We use receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) to
   evaluate event detection performance, and we introduce a technique to
   evaluate device-level event detection. We use confusion matrices to
   compare classification performance across several classifiers, and
   evaluate the resulting power assignments using several assignment
   metrics that are commonly used in the literature to demonstrate the
   varying strengths of the techniques that were considered. We apply this
   framework to several publicly available datasets and demonstrate how
   system performance varies with sampling frequency and the inclusion of
   reactive power. Our results suggest that (1) disaggregation performance
   varies considerably across data sets (2) increased data sampling rate
   improves disaggregation performance, and (3) additional features such as
   reactive power yields disaggregation performance improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Although definition of single-program benchmarks is relatively
   straight-forward-a benchmark is a program plus a specific
   input-definition of multi-program benchmarks is more complex. Each
   program may have a different runtime and they may have different
   interactions depending on how they align with each other. While prior
   work has focused on sampling multiprogram benchmarks, little attention
   has been paid to defining the benchmarks in their entirety.
   In this work, we propose a four-tuple that formally defines
   multi-program benchmarks in a well-defined way. We then examine how four
   different classes of benchmarks created by varying the elements of this
   tuple align with real-world use-cases. We evaluate the impact of these
   variations on real hardware, and see drastic variations in results
   between different benchmarks constructed from the same programs. Notable
   differences include significant speedups versus slowdowns (e.g., +57\%
   vs -5\% or +26\% vs -18\%), and large differences in magnitude even when
   the results are in the same direction (e.g., 67\% versus 11\%).}},

   explored the possibility of detecting and predicting seizures in this

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems ( CPS) are in most cases safety-and
   mission-critical. Standard design techniques used for securing embedded
   systems are not suitable for CPS due to the restricted computation and
   communication budget available in the latter. In addition, the
   sensitivity of sensed data and the presence of actuation components
   further increase the security requirements of CPS. To address these
   issues, it is necessary to provide new design methods in which security
   is considered from the beginning of the whole design flow and addressed
   in a holistic way. In this paper, we focus on the design of secure CPS
   as part of the complete CPS design process, and provide insights into
   new requirements on platform-aware design of control components, design
   methodologies and architectures posed by CPS design. We start by
   discussing methods for the multi-disciplinary modeling, simulation,
   tools, and software synthesis challenges for CPS. We also present a
   framework for design of secure control systems for CPS, while taking
   into account properties of the underlying computation and communication
   platforms. Finally, we describe the security challenges in the computing
   hardware that is used in CPS.}},

Abstract = {{Video camera architects must design cameras capable of high-quality,
   dynamic event capture, while adhering to power and communications
   constraints. Though modern imagers are capable of both simultaneous
   spatial and temporal resolutions at micrometer and microsecond scales,
   the power required to sample at these rates is undesirable. The field of
   compressive sensing (CS) has recently suggested a solution to this
   design challenge. By exploiting physical-layer compression strategies,
   one may overlay the original scene with a coding sequence to sample at
   sub-Nyquist rates with virtually no additional power requirement. The
   underlying scene may be later estimated without significant loss of
   fidelity. In this chapter, we cover a variety of such strategies taken
   to improve an imager's temporal resolution. Highlighting a new low-power
   acquisition paradigm, we show how a video sequence of high temporal
   resolution may be reconstructed from a single video frame taken with a
   low-framerate camera.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter introduces Shannon-inspired performance limits associated
   with the classification of low-dimensional subspaces embedded in a
   high-dimensional ambient space from compressive and noisy measurements.
   In particular, it introduces the diversity-discrimination tradeoff that
   describes the interplay between the number of classes that can be
   separated by a compressive classifier-measured via the discrimination
   gain-and the performance of such a classifier-measured via the diversity
   gain-and the relation of such an interplay to the underlying problem
   geometry, including the ambient space dimension, the subspaces
   dimension, and the number of compressive measurements. Such a
   fundamental limit on performance is derived from a syntactic equivalence
   between the compressive classification problem and certain wireless
   communications problems. This equivalence provides an opportunity to
   cross-pollinate ideas between the wireless information theory domain and
   the compressive classification domain. This chapter also demonstrates
   how theory aligns with practice in a concrete application: face
   recognition from a set of noisy compressive measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Soft and highly porous rocks such as calcarenites are very common in the
   entire Mediterranean region. Due to their porous calcareous structure
   these rocks are quite prone to water induced weathering mechanisms.
   Cliffs and underground cavities formed of calcarenites are frequently
   affected by intense erosion phenomena, weathering processes and
   unexpected collapses. These latter are usually the long-term result of a
   very complex hydro-chemo mechanical process taking place at the
   micro-scale which can be detected and analyzed by means of field and
   laboratory experimental test campaigns. Experimental tests results show
   a marked and instantaneous reduction in strength and stiffness for these
   porous rocks when macro-pores are filled with water and a slow
   successive reduction in strength and stiffness occurring in the
   long-term due to dissolution processes. To cope with deterministic
   assessment of the stability of natural and anthropic caves micro and
   macro experimental test were performed to identify the physics of the
   processes taking place at both the micro-scale and the macro-scale. A
   multiscale constitutive model following the framework of
   strain-hardening plasticity was formulated incorporating the hydro-chemo
   mechanical occurring at the microscale. The elasto-plastic constitutive
   model was implemented into the GeHoMadrid Finite Element code including
   the reactive transport of chemical species in a porous system. Small
   scale laboratory boundary value problems will be used to validate the
   coupled numerical code. Finally 2D FEM academic examples in calcarenite
   formation will be addressed: in the first, a failure mechanism triggered
   in the short term by a water infiltration from ground level is
   simulated; in the second a cliff instability occurring in a long term
   dissolution process is tackled.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method of decoupling two closely placed co-polarized antennas is

   tunable resonators are placed between them. By tuning the bias voltage
   of the eight rows, the amplitude and phase responses are altered.
   Correspondingly, the near field distribution is manipulated. Thus a
   high-level port to port isolations is realized. The measured results
   show that the transmission coefficient is suppressed to -110 dB, when
   the direct transmission coefficient (nothing is between the monopoles)
   is about -27 dB, and when a same dimension metal plate is installed it
   is -50.0 dB. Furthermore, this high-level isolation is tunable. We

Abstract = {{Explosive growth of data generation and increasing reliance of business

   Thus it has also become a critical issue for businesses to protect

   plays an important role for maintaining the desired level of data
   protection while minimizing the impact on system operation. In this
   paper we investigate the use of Markov Decision Process (MDP) to guide
   the planning of data backup operations. To improve the applicability of
   the MDP framework to large systems, we present a novel approximation
   method to enhance its scalability. The benefit of the framework is
   demonstrated through numerical examples, where our MDP method reduces
   the storage system downtime by over 50\% compared to the best heuristic

   However, the adoption of flow-based biochips is hampered by defects that

   Fault diagnosis methods are now needed to improve fabrication processes
   and facilitate the (partial) use of chips that have defects. We present
   the first approach for the automated diagnosis of flow-based
   microfluidic biochips. The proposed method facilitates the
   identification of defects through syndrome analysis and a hitting-set

Abstract = {{An information-theoretic framework is presented for bounding the number
   of samples needed for supervised learning in a parametric Bayesian
   setting. This framework is inspired by an analogy with rate-distortion
   theory, which characterizes tradeoffs in the lossy compression of random
   sources. In a parametric Bayesian environment, the maximum a posteriori
   classifier can be viewed as a random function of the model parameters.
   Labeled training data can be viewed as a finite-rate encoding of that
   source, and the excess loss due to using the learned classifier instead
   of the MAP classifier can be viewed as distortion. A strict bound on the
   loss-measured in terms of the expected total variation-is derived,
   providing a minimum number of training samples needed to drive the
   expected total variation to within a specified tolerance. The tightness
   of this bound is demonstrated on the classification of Gaussians, for
   which one can derive closed-form expressions for the bound.}},

Abstract = {{A novel low-profile aperture impedance matching technique of TEM
   Luneberg lens is presented. The trapezoidal strips at the edge of the
   lens is the impedance matching transition from the lens to the free

   over the 60-61 GHz at V -band is manufactured by using metamaterial
   surfaces. The refractive index of the lens is extracted by the novel
   Sparameter retrieval method. An inverted L probe antenna is used as the
   feeding structure which can excitate the TEM mode electromagnitic wave
   between the metal plate and the metamaterial surface, and this
   architecture is easy to produce. The matching structure improved the SLL
   (sidelobe level) with a 2 dB drop, so the far-field radiation pattern
   operates a good performance around the desired frequency band, which
   verified the validity of the aperture impedance matching technique.}},

   analysis of anisotropic, lossy, and open waveguides and cavities. It
   utilizes the edge-based curl-conforming Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL)
   polynomials to approximate the tangential vector of the electric field;
   and for waveguide problems, it uses the nodal-based scalar GLL basis
   functions to discretize its longitudinal component to obtain the highly

Abstract = {{The quantity of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) installations has grown
   rapidly in the US in recent years. There is a strong interest among
   decision makers in obtaining high quality information about rooftop PV,
   such as the locations, power capacity, and energy production of existing
   rooftop PV installations. Solar PV installations are typically connected
   directly to local power distribution grids, and therefore it is
   important for the reliable integration of solar energy to have
   information at high geospatial resolutions: by county, zip code, or even
   by neighborhood. Unfortunately, traditional means of obtaining this
   information, such as surveys and utility interconnection filings, are
   limited in availability and geospatial resolution. In this work a new
   approach is investigated where a computer vision algorithm is used to
   detect rooftop PV installations in high resolution color satellite
   imagery and aerial photography. It may then be possible to use the
   identified PV images to estimate power capacity and energy production
   for each array of panels, yielding a fast, scalable, and inexpensive
   method to obtain rooftop PV estimates for regions of any size. The aim
   of this work is to investigate the feasibility of the first step of the
   proposed approach: detecting rooftop PV in satellite imagery. Towards
   this goal, a collection of satellite rooftop images is used to develop
   and evaluate a detection algorithm. The results show excellent detection
   performance on the testing dataset and that, with further development,
   the proposed approach may be an effective solution for fast and scalable
   rooftop PV information collection.}},

   they will deform from spherical shape to ellipsoidal shape, and these
   effects may occur on cellular and organelles. Because of their potential
   clinical applications, selective effects on organelles are of particular
   interest. In this work, we use the finite element method to investigate
   the influence of nanosecond pulsed field on a double-shell ellipsoidal
   cell. The corresponding transmembrane potential (TMP) and pore density
   are examined to analyze the response of cells to such a short pulse
   field. Our active model demonstrates that for the prolate double-
   shelled cell, the TMP and pore density of the nuclear membrane exceed
   that on the cell membrane. Our calculation may be useful to guide

Abstract = {{In this paper, space-delay adaptive processing (SDAP) is proposed for
   motion mapping using MIMO RF signals. Typically, indoor RF localization
   methods require ultra-wideband signals to achieve the time-delay
   resolution required for separation of returns in complex multipath
   environments. Due to spectrum use restrictions, however, there is a need
   for methods which can operate using the lower bandwidths allocated for
   so-called ISM use. In this paper, we develop SDAP methods for linear
   MIMO transmit-receive arrays which can achieve near ultra-wideband range
   resolution and multipath sidelobe suppression but which use
   significantly less bandwidth. Real data results for indoor motion
   monitoring are presented aimed at mapping patient repositioning
   activities in long-term care facilities for pressure ulcer prevention.}},

   data-sets collected by a single acoustic vector-sensor. This approach
   requires neither a prior knowledge of the polynomial-phase signal's
   coefficients nor a prior knowledge of the polynomial-phase signal's
   frequency-spectrum. Furthermore, a preprocessing technique is proposed
   to incorporate the single-forgetting-factor algorithm and
   muItiple-forgetting-factor adaptive tracking algorithm to track a
   polynomial-phase signal using one acoustic vector sensor. Simulation
   results verify the efficacy of the proposed direction finding and source

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a robust online subspace estimation and
   tracking algorithm (ROSETA) that is capable of identifying and tracking
   a time-varying low dimensional subspace from incomplete measurements and
   in the presence of sparse outliers. Our algorithm minimizes a robust
   l(1) norm cost function between the observed measurements and their
   projection onto the estimated subspace. The projection coefficients and
   sparse outliers are computed using ADMM solver and the subspace estimate
   is updated using a proximal point iteration with adaptive parameter
   selection. We demonstrate using simulated experiments and a video
   background subtraction example that ROSETA succeeds in identifying and
   tracking low dimensional subspaces using fewer iterations than other
   state of art algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The classical Capture Point (CP) technique allows biped robots to take
   protective footsteps in case of a push or other disturbance, but only
   applies to flat terrain and a horizontally-moving Center of Mass (CoM).
   This paper generalizes the Capture Point technique to arbitrary terrains
   and CoM paths. Removing the CoM path constraint leads to an infinite
   number of Capture Points, each corresponding to a different path. A
   numerical algorithm is presented that, given an uneven terrain,
   enumerates Capture Points and their respective CoM trajectories. It is
   suitable for real-time usage as it produces all capture points in less
   than a millisecond on a standard PC. Proof-of-concept results are also
   demonstrated on a humanoid robot in a dynamic simulator.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing from space technology to measure star temperature, we developed
   a noninvasive sensor to passively track thermal profiles in tissues well
   below the skin (> 5cm). Ultra-low noise amplifiers combined with
   ultralow-loss switches in the 1-2GHz band produce a high sensitivity
   multiband microwave radiometer. Due to the complex multilayer anatomy of
   human head, multiple sensing bands are needed to reconstruct the
   temperature of deep brain tissue. This is achieved by using a digitally
   controlled filter bank. To study its accuracy, the sensor was calibrated
   and tested in a multilayer phantom model of the human head with
   differential scalp and brain temperatures. Results of phantom testing
   showed that calculated radiometric equivalent brain temperature agreed
   within 0.4 degrees C of measured temperature when circulating
   homogenized brain phantom was lowered 10 degrees C and returned to
   original temperature (37 degrees C), while scalp was maintained constant
   over a 4.6-hour experiment. Feasibility of clinical monitoring was
   assessed in a pediatric patient during a hypothermic heart surgery. Over
   the 2-hour surgery, the radiometric sensor tracked within 1 degrees C of
   rectal and nasopharynx temperatures, except during rapid cooldown and
   heatup periods when brain temperature deviated 2-4 degrees C from slower
   responding core temperature surrogates. In summary, the sensor
   demonstrated long term stability and sensitivity sufficient for accurate
   monitoring of volume average brain temperature to assist rapid recovery
   from hypothermic surgical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The brain operates on many different scales, from individual neurons to
   interacting cortical areas. Similarly, electrophysiology can monitor
   neural activity at a variety of spatial resolutions. Yet the majority of
   electrophysiology studies focus on a single scale of measurements.
   Simultaneously monitoring neural activity at multiple spatial scales
   will be critical for better understanding neural processing and
   developing neuroprosthetic applications. Here, we address the technical
   challenge of integrating multiple recording modalities into a chronic
   recording system. We developed a semi-chronic chamber-based system for
   non-human primates to simultaneously record subdural
   micro-electrocorticography (mu ECoG), local field potentials (LFPs) and
   action potentials in the same tissue volume. The system combines
   subdural mu ECoG array recordings with a microdrive and uses a chamber
   system and artificial duras to align each component. We present the
   system design and validation of subdural mu ECoG recordings using
   artificial duras. Acute recordings from one non-human primate subject
   are shown to validate the technique.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of kilohertz frequency signals on action potential
   conduction in small myelinated (1 to 5.7 mu m diameter) and unmyelinated
   axons are poorly understood, but could have important therapeutic
   applications. We developed a finite element model of a compound
   peripheral nerve and quantified the effects of a 5 kHz signal delivered
   via cuff electrode on conduction in small myelinated and unmyelinated
   axons. We compared the results from this realistic model to responses to
   the same signal delivered by an extracellular point source in a
   homogeneous isotropic extracellular medium. Using typical clinical
   parameters, the primary effect of the 5 kHz signal was excitation of the
   5.7 mu m diameter myelinated fibers in both models. The unmyelinated
   fibers were mostly unaffected by the applied signal. Axonal conduction
   block occurred only for certain parameter sets in the 5.7 mu m diameter
   myelinated fibers. Our model reveals the complexity of possible
   responses to kilohertz frequency signals, and suggests that mechanisms
   of therapeutic efficacy other than conduction block need to be
   considered. A better understanding of the effects of kilohertz frequency
   signals is needed to inform clinical parameter selection for electrical
   devices targeting conduction block in small fibers.}},

   optimized by overcoming the impedance of the skin using high-frequency
   (HF) stimulation signals. The excitation properties of nerve fibers
   depend on the spatiotemporal distribution of the extracellular field,
   and therefore quantifying the potentials during HF-TES is warranted. We
   present a physical phantom of TES that includes elements representing
   the skin and underlying tissue, and incorporates dispersion of the
   electrical conductivity as required during HF stimulation. We used both
   agar-based gels and biological materials, and doped the gels with
   graphite to add dispersion. We measured the dielectric properties of the
   materials, which we modified by adjusting the concentration of sodium
   chloride and graphite. We assembled up to three layers of material, and
   quantified the impedance as a function of frequency and depth. The
   impedance at any depth decayed with frequency, which suggests that HF
   signal may reach deeper structures in TES.}},

   ECoG designs have been developed and customized {[}1]-{[}4], including
   active, multiplexed arrays {[}5] and arrays on dissolving substrates for
   increased conformal contact {[}6]. However, designing and fabricating
   customized mu ECoG arrays requires access to microfabrication
   facilities, which many neuroscience labs do not have. Microfabrication
   is also typically labor intensive and expensive. Commercial mu ECoG
   arrays with 64 electrodes and coarser dimensions cost approximately
   \$1000, limiting their suitability for chronic implantation in large
   numbers of animals. Here we present a high density (406 mu m spacing),
   flexible (similar to 30 mu m thin), 61-contact mu ECoG electrode array
   fabricated using a low-cost, commercial manufacturing process. The array
   costs just \$26 when ordered in quantities of 100, with the cost per
   electrode increasing slightly when lower quantities are ordered. Fine
   pitch wires minimize the size of the interconnections, enabling chronic
   implantation in rodents. In-house post-processing of the fabricated mu
   ECoG arrays added optional electrode coatings, such as platinum black,
   to reduce the electrode impedance. Our electrode design and
   manufacturing process dramatically improves the accessibility and
   reduces the cost of high-volume, high-resolution neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{Cascading series of events are a salient feature of neural networks,
   where neuron spikes may stimulate or inhibit spike activity in other
   neurons. Only individual spike times associated with each neuron are
   observed, usually without knowledge of the underlying relationships
   among neurons. This paper addresses the challenge of tracking how spikes
   within such networks stimulate or influence future events. The proposed
   approach is an online learning framework well-suited to streaming data,
   using a multivariate Hawkes point process model to encapsulate
   autoregressive features of observed events within the network. Recent
   work on online learning in dynamic environments is leveraged not only to
   exploit the dynamics within the underlying network, but also to track
   that network structure as it evolves. Regret bounds and experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed method performs nearly as well as
   an oracle or batch algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic biochip technology integrates miniaturized components into
   a chip that can perform traditional biochemical laboratory procedures.
   Commercial impact is highlighted by the recent acquisition of Advanced
   Liquid Logic by Illumina Inc., a leader in DNA sequencing and
   biomolecular analysis. Due to the inherent variability involved in many
   biochemical processes, uncertainties manifest themselves in many ways in
   microfluidics. Cyber-physical integration of onchip sensors permits
   feedback-driven monitoring in-real time to detect and correct errors,
   along with other benefits such as adaptive control and dynamic
   re-synthesis. This paper overviews flow-based and digital
   (droplet-based) microfluidic biopchips, and discusses the
   state-of-the-art in microfluidic device fabrication, the interplay
   between sensor feedback and adaptive control software, and practical
   experiences relating to biochip cyber-physical integration. It
   demonstrates the connections between the many fundamental principles of

Abstract = {{The frequency mistuning that occurs due to manufacturing variations and
   wear and tear of the blades can have a significant effect on the flutter
   and forced response behavior of a blade row Similarly, asymmetries in
   the aerodynamic or excitation forces can tremendously affect the blade
   responses. When conducting CFD simulations, all blades are assumed to be
   tuned (i.e. to have the same natural frequency) and the aerodynamic
   forces are assumed to be the same on each blade except for a shift in
   interblade phase angle. The blades are thus predicted to vibrate at the
   same amplitude. However, when the system is mistuned or when asymmetries
   are present, some blades can vibrate with a much higher amplitude than
   the tuned, symmetric system. In this research, we first conduct a
   deterministic forced response analysis of a mistuned rotor and compare
   the results to experimental data from a compressor rig. It is shown that
   tuned CFD results cannot be compared directly with experimental data
   because of the impact of frequency mistuning on forced response
   predictions. Moreover, the individual impact of frequency, aerodynamic,
   and forcing function perturbations on the predictions is assessed,
   leading to the conclusion that a mistuned system has to be studied
   probabilistically. Finally, all perturbations are combined and
   Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to obtain the range of blade
   response amplitudes that a designer could expect.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of blade count ratio (BCR) on both the steady and unsteady
   blade loading and the sensitivity of generalized force to a change in
   mode shape (mode excitability) are studied numerically on two 2D
   configurations: a subsonic research compressor stage and a turbine stage
   with supersonic exit. Using the Harmonic Balance method, only a single
   passage is modeled to represent the actual blade count in a row at a
   high level of computational efficiency. BCR variation is achieved by
   scaling the downstream airfoils with a fixed chord-to-pitch ratio, thus.
   preserving the steady-state aerodynamics. It is found that the
   interaction among potential-, wake-, and shock-related excitations, and
   the relative strength of harmonic contents are dependent on BCR,
   resulting in a non-monotonic correlation between unsteady loading and
   BCR in the downstream row It is also found that the mode excitability
   can be sensitive to BCR variation in both up- and downstream rows in
   some cases. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work on
   BCR study involving supersonic flow and a discussion of mode
   excitability patterns.}},

Abstract = {{For an experimental study of aerodynamic damping in an axial low
   pressure turbine, a single stage subsonic turbine blisk is designed and
   aerodynamically and aeromechanically assessed. The design goals. are a
   low aerodynamic damping, to allow a long ring down of blade vibration,
   and aeromechanical stable operating points.
   With respect to these requirements, the aeromechanical analysis is
   executed using a time-linearized RANS method. The results of the final
   design are compared with another independent implementation of this
   method. Further, a preliminary flutter design tool is used to predict
   flutter stability and to cover the full range of current design tools.
   The rotor blading is manufactured as a blade integrated disk to
   eliminate friction damping in the planned experiment on the
   quantification of aerodynamic damping. To complement the study and to
   discuss the influence of damping, an experimental modal analysis of the
   manufactured blisk is completed to identify the frequency response and
   the damping.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a prediction framework of brain subcortical
   structures which are invisible on clinical low-field MRI, learning
   detailed information from ultrahigh-field MR training data. Volumetric
   segmentation of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) structures within the Basal
   ganglia is a prerequisite process for reliable DBS surgery. While
   ultrahighfield MR imaging (7 Tesla) allows direct visualization of DBS
   targeting structures, such ultrahigh-fields are not always clinically
   available, and therefore the relevant structures need to be predicted
   from the clinical data. We address the shape prediction problem with a
   regression forest, nonlinearly mapping predictors to target structures
   with high confidence, exploiting ultrahigh-field MR training data. We
   consider an application for the subthalamic nucleus (STN) prediction as
   a crucial DBS target. Experimental results on Parkinson's patients
   validate that the proposed approach enables reliable estimation of the
   STN from clinical 1.5T MRI.}},

   transform such sample across different domains for tasks such as pose

   content into either background or moving foreground. However, many
   situations require a foreground analysis with a finer temporal
   granularity, in particular for objects or people which remain immobile
   for a certain period of time. We propose an efficient method which
   detects foreground at different timescales, by exploiting the desirable
   theoretical and practical properties of Robust Principal Component
   Analysis. Our algorithm can be used in a variety of scenarios such as
   detecting people who have fallen in a video, or analysing the fluidity
   of road traffic, while avoiding costly computations needed for nearest
   neighbours searches or optical flow analysis. Finally, our algorithm has
   the useful ability to perform motion analysis without explicitly
   requiring computationally expensive motion estimation.}},

   improvement: Evidence from diffusion tensor MRI in children with
   cerebral palsy during therapy}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{315-324}},
Abstract = {{Cerebral Palsy (CP) refers to a heterogeneous group of permanent but
   non-progressive movement disorders caused by injury to the developing
   fetal or infant brain (Bax et al., 2005). Because of its serious
   long-term consequences, effective interventions that can help improve
   motor function, independence, and quality of life are critically needed.
   Our ongoing longitudinal clinical trial to treat children with CP is
   specifically designed to meet this challenge. To maximize the potential
   for functional improvement, all children in this trial received
   autologous cord blood transfusions (with order randomized with a placebo
   administration over 2 years) in conjunction with more standard physical
   and occupational therapies. As a part of this trial, magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) is used to improve our understanding of how these
   interventions affect brain development, and to develop biomarkers of
   treatment efficacy. In this report, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
   subsequent brain connectome analyses were performed in a subset of
   children enrolled in the clinical trial (n = 17), who all exhibited
   positive but varying degrees of functional improvement over the first
   2-year period of the study. Strong correlations between increases in
   white matter (WM) connectivity and functional improvement were
   demonstrated; however no significant relationships between either of
   these factors with the age of the child al time of enrollment were
   identified. Thus, our data indicate that increases in brain connectivity
   reflect improved functional abilities in children with CP. In future
   work, this potential biomarker can be used to help differentiate the
   underlying mechanisms of functional improvement, as well as to identify
   treatments that can best facilitate functional improvement upon
   un-blinding of the timing of autologous cord blood transfusions at the
   completion of this study. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A significant limitation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is
   that the magnetic pulse delivery is associated with a loud clicking
   sound as high as 140 dB resulting from electromagnetic forces. The loud
   noise significantly impedes both basic research and clinical
   applications of TMS. It effectively makes TMS less focal since every
   click activates auditory cortex, brainstem, and other connected regions,
   synchronously with the magnetic pulse. The repetitive clicking sound can
   induce neuromodulation that can interfere with and confound the intended
   effects at the TMS target. As well, there are known concerns regarding
   blinding of TMS studies, hearing loss, induction of tinnitus, as well as
   tolerability. Addressing this need, we are developing a quiet TMS (qTMS)
   device that incorporates two key concepts: First, the dominant frequency
   components of the TMS pulse sound (typically 2-5 kHz) are shifted to
   higher frequencies that are above the human hearing upper threshold of
   about 20 kHz. Second, the TMS coil is designed electrically and
   mechanically to generate suprathreshold electric field pulses while
   minimizing the sound emitted at audible frequencies (< 20 kHz). The
   enhanced acoustic properties of the coil are accomplished with a novel,
   layered coil design. We summarize a proof-of-concept qTMS prototype
   demonstrating noise loudness reduction by 19 dB(A) with ultrabrief
   pulses at conventional amplitudes. Further, we outline next steps to
   accomplish further sound reduction and suprathreshold pulse amplitudes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel task-independent method for quantifying arm
   motion similarity that can be applied to any kineinatic/dynainic
   variable of interest. Given two arm motions for the same task, not
   necessarily with the same completion time, it plots the time-normalized
   curves against one another and generates four real-valued features. To
   validate these features we apply them to quantify the relationship
   between healthy and paretic arm motions of chronic stroke patients.
   Studying both unimanual and bimanual arm motions of eight chronic stroke
   patients, we find that inter-arm coupling that tends to synchronize the
   motions of both arms in bimanual motions, has a stronger effect at
   task-relevant joints than at task-irrelevant joints. It also revealed
   that the paretic arm suppresses the shoulder flexion of the non-paretic
   arm, while the latter encourages the shoulder rotation of the former.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for segmenting a set of unstructured demonstration
   trajectories to discover reusable skills using inverse reinforcement
   learning (IRL). Each skill is characterised by a latent reward function
   which the demonstrator is assumed to be optimizing. The skill boundaries
   and the number of skills making up each demonstration are unknown. We
   use a Bayesian nonparametric approach to propose skill segmentations and
   maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning to infer reward functions
   from the segments. This method produces a set of Markov Decision
   Processes (MDPs) that best describe the input trajectories. We evaluate
   this approach in a car driving domain and a simulated quadcopter
   obstacle course, showing that it is able to recover demonstrated skills
   more effectively than existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene's relatively poor absorption is an essential obstacle for
   designing graphene-based photonic devices with satisfying

   incorporating periodic cylindrical gold nanoparticle (NP) cluster arrays
   with Bragg reflectors into graphene-based photodetectors are
   theoretically studied by the boundary-integral spectral element method
   (BI-SEM). With the BI-SEM, the models can be numerically analyzed with
   excellent accuracy and efficiency. Numerical simulation shows that the
   proposed structures can effectively engineer the light absorption in
   graphene by tuning plasmon resonance. In the spectra of 300 nm to 1000
   nm, a maximum light absorption of 76.13\% is observed for the graphene

Abstract = {{Asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion planners, like RRT{*},
   perform vast amounts of collision checking, and are hence rather slow to
   converge in complex problems where collision checking is relatively
   expensive. This paper presents two novel motion planners, Lazy-PRM{*}
   and Lazy-RRG{*}, that eliminate the majority of collision checks using a
   lazy strategy. They are sampling-based, any-time, and asymptotically
   complete algorithms that grow a network of feasible vertices connected
   by edges. Edges are not immediately checked for collision, but rather
   are checked only when a better path to the goal is found. This strategy
   avoids checking the vast majority of edges that have no chance of being
   on an optimal path. Experiments show that the new methods converge
   toward the optimum substantially faster than existing planners on rigid
   body path planning and robot manipulation problems.}},

Abstract = {{In virtual reality applications, there is an aim to provide real time
   graphics which run at high refresh rates. However, there are many
   situations in which this is not possible due to simulation or rendering
   issues. When running at low frame rates, several aspects of the user
   experience are affected. For example, each frame is displayed for an
   extended period of time, causing a high persistence image artifact. The
   effect of this artifact is that movement may lose continuity, and the
   image jumps from one frame to another. In this paper, we discuss our
   initial exploration of the effects of high persistence frames caused by
   low refresh rates and compare it to high frame rates and to a technique
   we developed to mitigate the effects of low frame rates. In this
   technique, the low frame rate simulation images are displayed with low
   persistence by blanking out the display during the extra time such image
   would be displayed. In order to isolate the visual effects, we
   constructed a simulator for low and high persistence displays that does
   not affect input latency. A controlled user study comparing the three
   conditions for the tasks of 3D selection and navigation was conducted.
   Results indicate that the low persistence display technique may not
   negatively impact user experience or performance as compared to the high
   persistence case. Directions for future work on the use of low
   persistence displays for low frame rate situations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the Accelerated Distributed Augmented Lagrangians (ADAL)
   algorithm, a distributed optimization algorithm that was recently
   developed by the authors to address problems that involve multiple
   agents optimizing a separable convex objective function subject to
   convex local constraints and linear coupling constraints. Optimization
   using augmented Lagrangians (AL) combines low computational complexity
   with fast convergence speeds due to the regularization terms included in
   the AL. However, decentralized methods that employ ALs are few, as
   decomposition of ALs is a particularly challenging task. ADAL is a
   primal-dual iterative scheme where at every iteration the agents locally
   optimize a novel separable approximation of the AL and then
   appropriately update their primal and dual variables, in a way that
   ensures convergence to their respective optimal sets. In this paper, we
   prove that ADAL has a worstcase O(1/k) convergence rate, where k denotes
   the number of iterations. The convergence rate is established in an
   ergodic sense, i. e., it refers to the ergodic average of the generated
   sequences of primal variables up to iteration k.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model-based approach for source identification
   using sparse recovery techniques. In particular, given an arbitrary
   domain that contains a set of unknown sources and a set of stationary
   sensors that can measure a quantity generated by the sources, we are
   interested in predicting the shape, location, and intensity of the
   sources based on a limited number of sensor measurements. We assume a
   PDE model describing the steady-state transport of the quantity inside
   the domain, which we discretize using the Finite Element method (FEM).
   Since the resulting source identification problem is under-determined
   for a limited number of sensor measurements and the sought source vector
   is typically sparse, we employ a novel Reweighted l(1) regularization
   technique combined with Least Squares Debiasing to obtain a unique,
   sparse, reconstructed source vector. The simulations confirm the
   applicability of the presented approach for an Advection-Diffusion

Abstract = {{This paper addresses optimal path planning and resource allocation for
   active multi-target localization. For each target, we solve a local
   Dynamic Program (DP) that plans optimal trajectories in the joint
   state-space of robot positions and target location uncertainties,
   captured by a cumulative error covariance matrix. The transitions in the
   space of robot positions are governed by the robot dynamics, while the
   transitions in the space of target uncertainties are regulated by a
   Kalman filter (KF) that fuses new information about the target locations
   with the current beliefs. The fused target uncertainties enter the
   objective function of the local DP using the trace of the associated
   covariance matrix. Using the optimal sensing policies local to each
   target, we construct a global DP to determine how far along the single
   target optimal trajectories the sensor should travel before
   transitioning to the next target. The integrated system jointly
   optimizes the collective target localization uncertainty and the total
   distance traveled by the sensing agent. The proposed control scheme is
   more computationally efficient than methods that use only the sensor
   configuration to compute future uncertainty and more exact than methods
   that abstract away the filtered sensing uncertainty.}},

   covariance matrices of the primary and the secondary data share a common

   exploited where both the textures and the structure are assumed to be
   random. Precisely, the textures follow inverse Gamma distribution and
   the structure is drawn from an inverse complex Wishart distribution. In

Abstract = {{Due to an increased appreciation for the importance of mechanical
   stimuli in many biological contexts, an interest in measuring the forces

   The development and use of Forster resonance energy transfer

   studies and led to important insights into the mechanisms those cells
   utilize to probe and respond to the mechanical nature of their
   surrounding environment. The process for creating and utilizing
   FRET-based tension sensors can be divided into three main parts:
   construction, imaging, and analysis. First we review several methods for
   the construction of genetically encoded FRET-based tension sensors,
   including restriction enzyme-based methods as well as the more recently
   developed overlap extension or Gibson Assembly protocols. Next, we
   discuss the intricacies associated with imaging tension sensors,
   including optimizing imaging parameters as well as common techniques for
   estimating artifacts within standard imaging systems. Then, we detail
   the analysis of such data and describe how to extract useful information
   from a FRET experiment. Finally, we provide a discussion on identifying
   and correcting common artifacts in the imaging of FRET-based tension
   sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Chip designers typically do not consider design-for-diagnosis (DfD) for
   manufacturing defects while implementing an integrated circuit and its
   design-for-test features. The lack of emphasis on DfD results in low
   diagnosis resolution and limited physical failure analysis (PFA) success
   rate when diagnosis is carried out using advanced techniques. To the
   best of our knowledge, no practical solution is available today to
   analyze the diagnosability of a design and improve it before tapeout.
   Furthermore, techniques that are specific to a given design cannot be
   reused for other chips. Therefore, we first propose a general
   structure-based diagnosability scoring model that can be used to analyze
   the diagnostic resolution for any chip. After the diagnosability
   analysis, we consider inserting additional observation points (OPs) for
   diagnosability enhancement. Given a constraint on the maximum number of
   inserted OPs, we propose a three-stage OP insertion (OPI) method, which
   includes: (i) selection of hard-to-diagnose (HTD) faults; (ii) mixed
   location ranking based on a structure-based diagnosability ``repair{''}
   scoring model; (iii) information update and final location selection for
   a better diagnosability ``repair{''} effect. The use of OPI results in
   higher fault ``repair{''} rates and significant improvement in
   diagnosability. Experiments on benchmark circuits and industrial designs
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DfD solution.}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidics is viewed as one of the most promising
   technologies for biomedical experiments. Digital microfluidic biochips
   are often used today for applications such as point-of-care health
   assessment, drug discovery, and airquality monitoring. Therefore, such
   devices must be adequately tested after manufacturing to guarantee the
   correctness of the biomedical experiments. Previous test methods for
   digital microfluidic biochips are either unable to cover all chip
   defects or inapplicable for application-specific biochips with arbitrary
   layouts. Furthermore, previous methods also ignore the fluidic
   constraints required for droplet routing, which makes the test droplet
   routing problem much more challenging in realistic test-application
   scenarios. In this paper, we propose the first test method for digital
   microfluidic biochips that is not only able to cover all chip defects,
   but is also applicable for arbitrary chip layouts. Moreover, we propose
   an optimization technique to route test droplets with minimum
   test-application time. A polynomial-time scheduling algorithm is also
   presented to solve the optimization problem in an efficient manner.
   Experiments demonstrate that the proposed test method requires
   significantly less test-application time compared to related previous
   work.}},

Abstract = {{The use of multiple voltage levels introduces new challenges fin-testing
   Multi-V-dd SoCs. Time-Division-Multiplexing (TDM) tackles many of these
   challenges and offers very effective test-schedules. However, the
   effectiveness of TDM for minimizing test time depends on the
   lest-Access-Mechanism (TAM) in the SoC. Single-V-dd TAM optimization
   techniques consider neither the highly constrained test environment of
   multi-V-dd SoCs nor the benefits provided by TDM, therefore they are not
   suitable for multi-V-dd SoCs. In this paper, we propose the first TAXI
   optimization technique fir multi-V-dd SoCs. The proposed method exploits
   unique scheduling opportunities and flexibility offered by TDM and by
   the means of a Branch-\&-Bound approach, it quickly identifies the most
   effective TAM configurations. Experiments using SoCs from industry
   highlight the benefits of the proposed technique on multi-Vu designs,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we employ electromagnetic theory to analyze the
   phenomenon of signal propagation and thereby model mobile communication
   systems. Using electromagnetic theory is different from conventional
   modeling techniques applied in communication engineering, the advantage
   being that a more in-depth and accurate model can be provided. This is
   because the electromagnetism-based model exactly measures the
   electromagnetic behavior of a signal and hence, more details of the
   ambient environment are involved in the modeling procedure. However, it
   should not be tendentiously ignored that the disadvantage is also
   obvious. Because superabundant details should be involved, this model is
   sometimes inefficient and even impractical. To investigate this
   innovative modeling technique in more detail, we provide a simplified
   propagation scenario through only considering direct and single
   reflected paths between the transmitter and the receiver. By means of
   this special case study, the pros and cons of electromagnetism-based
   modeling can be revealed extensively. A series of familiar concepts and
   jargons frequently referred to in wireless mobile communication are also
   interpreted in view of the electromagnetism-based modeling technique.
   More importantly, in this paper, the nature of signal transmission and
   reception in free space can be analyzed in depth by virtue of this
   modeling technique.}},

Abstract = {{Many obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients experience sensory
   phenomena, such as bodily sensations and ``just-right'' perceptions
   accompanying compulsions. We studied tactile processing in OCD by
   psychophysical experiments targeting the somatosensory cortex.
   Thirty-two children and adolescents with OCD (8 tic-related, 19 with
   sensory phenomena (SP)) and their sex-and age-matched controls
   participated in the study. After clinical assessments, two
   questionnaires were completed for sensory problems (Sensory Profile and
   Touch Inventory for Elementary-School-Aged Children). The psychophysical
   experiments consisted of five tasks: simple reaction time, choice
   reaction time, dynamic (detection) threshold, amplitude discrimination,
   and amplitude discrimination with single-site adaptation. The tactile
   stimuli were sinusoidal mechanical vibrations (frequency: 25 Hz) applied
   on the fingertips. Just-noticeable differences (JNDs) were found in
   amplitude discrimination tasks. There was no difference between the OCD
   group and controls in detection thresholds. However, the OCD group
   (especially young males) had worse amplitude discrimination (i. e.,
   higher JNDs) than controls. Young OCD participants had reduced
   adaptation than young controls. Tic-related OCD participants and those
   with SP had higher detection thresholds than those without.
   Additionally, the OCD group reported more problems than controls in the
   Emotional/Social subset of the Sensory Profile questionnaire. The
   discrimination results show altered tactile processing in OCD at
   suprathreshold levels. This can be explained by a scaling factor
   modifying the sensory signal with decreasing slope at higher input
   levels to achieve normal Weber fractions internally. Quadratic
   discriminant analysis gave the best positive (76\%) and negative (60\%)
   predictive values for classifying individuals (into ``OCD'' or
   ``control'' groups) based on psychophysical data alone.}},

Abstract = {{Run-time solutions based on real-time monitoring and adaptation are
   required for resilience in nanoscale integrated circuits as design-time
   solutions and guard bands are no longer sufficient. Bias Temperature
   Instability (BTI)-induced transistor aging, one of the major reliability
   threats in nanoscale VLSI, degrades path delay over time and may
   eventually induce circuit failure due to timing violations. Chip health
   monitoring is, therefore, necessary to track delay changes on a per-chip
   basis. Chip-monitoring techniques based on actual measurement of path
   delays can only track a coarse-grained aging trend in a reactive manner.
   In this paper, we show how the on-chip design for test (DfT)
   infrastructure can be reused in order to perform fine-grain
   workload-induced stress monitoring for accurate aging prediction. The
   captured stress information is fed to a prediction model in real-time.
   The prediction model is trained offline using support-vector regression
   and implemented in software. This approach can leverage proactive
   adaptation techniques to mitigate further aging of the circuit by
   monitoring aging trends. Simulation results for realistic open-source
   benchmark circuits highlight the accuracy of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in microfluidic technologies have led to the emergence of
   Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs), which are capable of automating
   laboratory procedures in biochemistry and molecular biology. During the
   design and use of these devices, droplet routing represents a
   particularly critical challenge. Here, various design tasks have to be
   addressed for which, depending on the corresponding scenario, different
   solutions are available. However, all these developments eventually
   result in an ``inflation{''} of different design approaches for routing
   of DMFBs - many of them addressing a very dedicated routing task only.
   In this work, we propose a comprehensive routing methodology which (1)
   provides one (generic) solution capable of addressing a variety of
   different design tasks, (2) employs a ``push-button{''}-scheme that
   requires no (manual) composition of partial results, and (3) guarantees
   minimality e.g., with respect to the number of timesteps or the number
   of required control pins. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the
   benefits of the solution, i.e., the applicability for a wide range of
   design tasks as well as improvements compared to specialized solutions
   presented in the past.}},

   signal has low order polynomial phase. We can reconstruct the signal

Abstract = {{Although skeletal muscle is one of the most regenerative organs in our
   body, various genetic defects, alterations in extrinsic signaling, or
   substantial tissue damage can impair muscle function and the capacity

   attracted much interest from both cell biologists and, more recently,
   bioengineers, leading to concentrated efforts to better understand
   muscle pathology and develop more efficient therapies. This review
   describes the biological underpinnings of muscle development, repair,
   and disease, and discusses recent bioengineering efforts to design and
   control myomimetic environments, both to study muscle biology and
   function and to aid in the development of new drug, cell, and gene
   therapies for muscle disorders. The synergy between engineering-aided
   biological discovery and biology-inspired engineering solutions will be
   the path forward for translating laboratory results into clinical

Abstract = {{In order to use persistence diagrams as a true statistical tool, it
   would be very useful to have a good notion of mean and variance for a
   set of diagrams. In {[}23], Mileyko and his collaborators made the first
   study of the properties of the Frechet mean in (D-p, W-p), the space of
   persistence diagrams equipped with the p-th Wasserstein metric. In
   particular, they showed that the Frechet mean of a finite set of
   diagrams always exists, but is not necessarily unique. The means of a
   continuously-varying set of diagrams do not themselves (necessarily)
   vary continuously, which presents obvious problems when trying to extend
   the Frechet mean definition to the realm of time-varying persistence
   diagrams, better known as vineyards.
   We fix this problem by altering the original definition of Frechet mean
   so that it now becomes a probability measure on the set of persistence
   diagrams; in a nutshell, the mean of a set of diagrams will be a
   weighted sum of atomic measures, where each atom is itself a persistence
   diagram determined using a perturbation of the input diagrams. This
   definition gives for each N a map (D-p)(N) -> P(D-p). We show that this
   map is Holder continuous on finite diagrams and thus can be used to
   build a useful statistic on vineyards.}},

Abstract = {{The RubiX {[}1] algorithm combines high SNR characteristics of low
   resolution data with high spacial specificity of high resolution data,
   to extract microstructural tissue parameters from diffusion MRI. In this
   paper we focus on estimating crossing fiber orientations and introduce
   sparsity to the RubiX algorithm, making it suitable for reconstruction
   from compressed (under-sampled) data. We propose a sparse Bayesian
   algorithm for estimation of fiber orientations and volume fractions from
   compressed diffusion MRI. The data at high resolution is modeled using a
   parametric spherical deconvolution approach and represented using a
   dictionary created with the exponential decay components along different
   possible directions. Volume fractions of fibers along these orientations
   define the dictionary weights. The data at low resolution is modeled
   using a spatial partial volume representation. The proposed dictionary
   representation and sparsity priors consider the dependence between fiber
   orientations and the spatial redundancy in data representation. Our
   method exploits the sparsity of fiber orientations, therefore
   facilitating inference from under-sampled data. Experimental results
   show improved accuracy and decreased uncertainty in fiber orientation
   estimates. For under-sampled data, the proposed method is also shown to
   produce more robust estimates of fiber orientations.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces a robust framework for predicting Deep Brain
   Stimulation (DBS) target structures which are not identifiable on
   standard clinical MRI. While recent high-field MR imaging allows clear
   visualization of DBS target structures, such high-fields are not
   clinically available, and therefore DBS targeting needs to be performed
   on the standard clinical low contrast data. We first learn via
   regression models the shape relationships between DBS targets and their
   potential predictors from high-field (7 Tesla) MR training sets. A
   bagging procedure is utilized in the regression model, reducing the
   variability of learned dependencies. Then, given manually or
   automatically detected predictors on the clinical patient data, the
   target structure is predicted using the learned high quality
   information. Moreover, we derive a robust way to properly weight
   different training subsets, yielding higher accuracy when using an
   ensemble of predictions. The subthalamic nucleus (STN), the most common
   DBS target for Parkinson's disease, is used to exemplify within our
   framework. Experimental validation from Parkinson's patients shows that
   the proposed approach enables reliable prediction of the STN from the
   clinical 1.5T MR data.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound imaging of deep abdominal targets suffers from low lateral
   resolution due to limited aperture size and low-frequency transmit
   pulses. We demonstrate phantom and in vivo imaging results using a
   device that allows a tracked mechanical sweep of a commercially
   available ultrasound array. The position data and device calibration
   have sufficient precision to allow coherent combination of the
   backscattered echoes from array positions separated by up to 56.4
   degrees at a radius of 10 cm acquired in a time frame of one second,
   forming a synthetic aperture significantly larger than the physical
   footprint of the array. In a wire phantom, an 87.5\% reduction in full
   width at half maximum is achieved using this method compared to a
   single-position full synthetic aperture acquisition. In addition to
   increased resolution, a 4.2 dB improvement in contrast and 17.3\%
   improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio were measured in a fetal phantom
   target. The technique was successfully applied to an in vivo liver study
   using a 45 degree sweep, improving the visibility of both large anechoic
   targets and small structures on the order of the resolution cell of a
   conventional image.}},

Abstract = {{Time-delay and phase-shift estimators are often used to track speckle
   signals in order to estimate parameters such as strain, displacement,
   and velocity. These estimators rely on the beamformed RF signal to
   accurately estimate time and phase shifts. Partially coherent targets
   such as speckle, however, introduce variance and bias errors into the
   estimation because the delay-and-sum beamformer does not adapt to the
   spatial variation of the sampled waveform. In addition, the presence of
   acoustic and thermal noise can exacerbate this problem. We introduce a
   method that modifies the information used by the beamformer when it is
   applied to velocity and displacement estimation.
   Using simulations, velocity was estimated between RF channel signals,
   rather than beamformed RF signals, using Kasai's and Loupas'
   autocorrelation methods. Velocity and displacement was estimated from
   those channel signal pairs that exhibited high correlation. By
   eliminating incoherent information in Kasai's and Loupas' velocity
   estimators, jitter was reduced in high noise environments. For example,
   at 0 dB noise relative to the blood in the channel signals, Limiting the
   signal to high coherence signals (e.g. 10 spatial lags) reduced the
   jitter in the Kasai velocity estimator from approximately 6.0 mm/s to
   2.5 mm/s. In general, jitter increased with increasingly incoherent
   information added into the beamformed signal and low noise yielded
   smaller jitter.}},

Abstract = {{This work discusses eight sources of uncertainty and bias arising from
   system dependent parameters in ultrasound shear wave speed (SWS)
   measurement. Each of the eight error sources of error we have identified
   is discussed in the context of a linear, isotropic, elastic, homogeneous
   medium, combining previously reported analyses with Field II
   simulations, full-wave 2D acoustic propagation simulations and
   experimental studies. Errors arising from both spatial and temporal
   sources lead to errors in SWS measurements. Arrival time estimation
   noise, speckle bias, master clock jitter, and phase aberration cause
   uncertainties (variance) in SWS measurements, while pulse repetition
   frequency and beamforming errors, as well as coupling medium sound speed
   mismatch cause biases in SWS measurements (accuracy errors). Calibration
   of these sources of error is an important step in the development of
   shear wave imaging systems. In a well-calibrated system, where the
   sources of biases are minimized, and averaging over an ROI is employed
   to reduce the sources of uncertainty, a SWS error < 3\% can be expected.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue harmonic imaging (THI) has been widely used in abdominal imaging
   due to its significant reduction in acoustic noise compared to
   fundamental imaging. However, THI can be both signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) and penetration-depth limited during clinical imaging, resulting
   in decreased diagnostic utility. A logical approach is to increase the
   source pressure, but the in situ pressures used in diagnostic imaging
   have been subject to a de facto upper limit based upon the Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) guideline for the Mechanical Index (MI < 1.9) since
   1992. A recent AIUM report concluded that exceeding MI of 1.9 up to an
   estimated in situ value of 4.0, could be warranted without concern for
   increased risk of cavitation in non-fetal tissues without gas bodies.
   This work quantifies the benefit of elevated acoustic output in hepatic
   harmonic imaging. Increasing MI values were shown to be associated with
   increases in harmonic signal content, penetration depth, and vessel
   Contrast-to-noise ratio in THI images. Obese patients who suffer from
   poor ultrasound image quality are more likely to benefit from elevated
   acoustic output to enable better THI performance.}},

   (MTL-SWEI) is a powerful tool for noninvasively estimating tissue
   elasticity. The resolution and noise of MTL-SWEI systems, however, are

   a novel variant which fixes the position of the tracking beam and
   modulates the push location to effectively cancel out the effects of

Abstract = {{Echocardiography is widely used to evaluate cardiovascular function in
   real-time; however, endocardial borders are often inadequately
   visualized due to clutter. Contrast agents, while effective, increase
   cost and examination time. SLSC imaging is a coherence-based beamforming
   technique that has demonstrated clutter reducing capabilities in a
   variety of applications. Previously, real-time SLSC imaging of a large
   field of view was achieved at up to 6 fps, inadequate for visualizing a
   quickly moving target such as the heart. In our previous work, we
   developed efficient modifications to the SLSC algorithm to obtain fast
   and precise measurements of spatial coherence. In this work, these
   techniques were implemented on a GPU-based software beamformer to
   develop a real-time SLSC imaging system suitable for echocardiography.
   The system was then used in a clinical study to image 15 patients with
   poor image quality, as determined by trained sonographers. Real-time
   display of sideby- side B-mode and SLSC images were obtained at frame
   rates ranging from 21 to 31 fps. B-mode and SLSC video clips were given
   in shuffled order to a cardiologist, who rated the visibility s of each
   of 12 LV segments as 0=invisible, 1=poorly visualized, or 2=well
   visualized. Scores of 0 and 1 indicated a need for contrast agent. A
   two-tailed paired t-test showed that SLSC imaging demonstrated a
   statistically significant increase in the number of visualized segments
   (s > 0, p = 0.0032) and in the number of segments that were well
   visualized (s = 2, p = 0.0061).}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial elasticity is an important indicator of cardiac function and
   is affected in many disorders associated with heart failure. Ultrasound
   based interrogation of cardiac stiffness has been extensively studied in
   ex-vivo, open chest and intracardiac imaging environments. The ability
   to make these measurements robustly through non-invasive means such as
   transthoracic imaging would make them more clinically viable and widely
   applicable. However, transthoracic imaging is a challenging environment
   for displacement estimation due to poor SNR, acoustic clutter and
   complex cardiac motion. This work aims to address some of those
   challenges on a clinical ultrasound system. Sequences to make M-mode
   measurements of acoustic radiation force induced displacements in the
   heart over the entire cardiac cycle were implemented on the Siemens
   SC2000 and a cardiac phased array probe. Pulse inversion harmonic
   tracking was employed on the tracking beams to suppress the effect of
   stationary clutter on displacement estimation. Two families of motion
   filters, high pass filters and polynomial fit filters were analyzed for
   their performance in being able to remove the background cardiac motion
   and isolate the radiation force induced tissue response. Clinical data
   was acquired on 4 subjects and analyzed for repeatability of diastolic
   vs. systolic displacements. A high pass filter with a cutoff of 100 Hz
   and a 2nd order polynomial fit filter were found to be equally effective
   in suppressing intrinsic motion. Diastolic-to-systolic displacement
   ratios measured in the interventricular septum ranged from 1.3 to 2.2
   across subjects but were found to be fairly consistent between the
   parasternal long axis and the parasternal short axis views for each
   subject.}},

Abstract = {{Sclerotic skin diseases are associated with inflammation and fibrosis in
   the dermis, and these changes in collagen content with disease
   progression make this pathology amenable to being characterized with
   Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) and Shear Wave Elasticity
   Imaging (SWEI) methods. We characterized skin stiffness in healthy
   individuals at repeated three month intervals and compared sclerotic to
   healthy skin stiffness. ARFI and SWEI were implemented using a Siemens
   14L5 linear array on an ACUSON S2000 (TM) scanner. A single
   dermatologist performed all imaging in twenty-two patients. Normal and
   sclerotic skin stiffnesses were characterized by (1) mean ARFI
   displacement magnitude, and (2) group shear wave speed estimated using a
   Radon sum of shear wave velocity data. Imaging was performed at
   different anatomic sites, including the upper and lower back, arm,
   forearm, abdomen, thigh and calf. Five repeat data acquisitions were
   performed in each anatomic location. ARFI displacement and SWEI shear
   wave speeds were reconstructed in 96\% of all acquisitions when the
   region of interest was exclusively contained in the dermis. Overall,
   ARFI and SWEI metrics showed no significant difference between
   contralateral imaging locations across different anatomic sites in
   healthy skin (p < 0.05). Mean shear wave speeds were >200\% greater in
   sclerotic lesions than in contralateral healthy skin in patients with
   graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (p < 0.01), and 25\% greater in
   patients with morphea. ARFI displacements exhibited greater variability
   than shear wave speed in characterizing sclerotic skin, showing a 61\%
   decrease compared to healthy skin in GVHD patients (p < 0.05) and a 19\%
   decrease in morphea patients (p < 0.05). ARFI and SWEI are able
   differentiate sclerotic skin lesions from healthy skin, and studies are
   underway to evaluate their utility in longitudinally-monitoring disease
   progression and response to therapy. Additional study details, data and
   conclusions can be found in the full-length manuscript describing this

Abstract = {{Power Doppler (PD) imaging is a widely used technique for flow detection
   in clinics, and is utilized as an adjunct tool for prenatal/placental
   vessel evaluation. However, the sensitivity of PD in small vessel
   detection is limited by the small-diameter and slow flow of the
   placental vasculature, where abnormalities are indicative of disorders
   including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and early pregnancy
   loss. In order to provide more sensitive detection of placental
   vasculature, a coherent flow imaging technique, termed coherent flow
   power Doppler (CFPD), is characterized and evaluated with both
   simulation and flow-phantom experiment studies. The results from both
   studies suggest that CFPD is able to provide 15-25 dB increase in the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Doppler images. Due to the increase in
   SNR, CFPD is able to detect small vessels in high channel noise cases,
   for which PD was unable to generate enough contrast on the vessel. Such
   cases are not uncommon among people with high body mass index. The
   results indicate that the CFPD method is a promising candidate for small
   vessel imaging.}},

   wide range of biases are observed depending on specific values of
   frequency and aspect ratio R of the source asymmetry. These biases can
   be reduced significantly by weighting the shear wave signal in the

Abstract = {{In traditional shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI), shear wave velocity
   is measured away from the acoustic radiation force (ARF) axis. Instead,
   we measure the time-to-peak displacement of tissue directly along the
   ARF axis. Measuring displacements along this axis rather than off-axis
   simplifies hardware required for quantifying tissue stiffness.
   Previously this method has been demonstrated, but the measurement
   variance was too high for practical feasibility. To reduce stiffness
   estimation error, we apply our Bayesian displacement estimator.
   To evaluate the Bayesian estimator, we used 3D finite element analysis
   to model soft tissue response to the acoustic radiation force and Field
   II to simulate the radio-frequency (RF) data of the tissue response. The
   Bayesian displacement estimator is applied to RF data to improve tissue
   displacement estimates, which then improves time-to-peak displacement
   estimates and the final stiffness estimate. Time-to-peak displacement is
   proportional to shear wave speed if we assume the medium is linear,
   elastic, and isotropic. Here, shear wave speed is directly related to
   shear stiffness, and we create look-up tables to estimate stiffness
   using time-to-peak displacement as a function of depth. We modeled an
   L12-5 50 mm linear transducer with a transmit frequency of 7.8 MHz, 2 cm
   focus, and push F/2.5. The average displacement data from 20 speckle
   realizations of each tissue stiffness were used to generate the
   stiffness look-up tables. Our Bayesian displacement estimator had lower
   mean square error (MSE) in stiffness estimates compared to using a
   traditional Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) estimator.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental context Chirally enriched semiconducting single-walled
   carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are some of the most utilised nanomaterials.
   Although chirality of SWNTs is known to influence their electronic
   properties and interfacial interaction, the interplay between chirality
   and surfactant structure in SWNT stability is not well understood. This
   study investigates these interactions, providing data to better assess
   the environmental fate of SWNTs.
   Abstract Single-walled carbon nanotubes' (SWNT) effectiveness in
   applications is enhanced by debundling or stabilisation. Anionic
   surfactants are known to effectively stabilise SWNTs. However, the role
   of specific chirality on surfactant-stabilised SWNT aggregation has not
   been studied to date. The aggregation behaviour of chirally enriched
   (6,5) and (7,6) semiconducting SWNTs, functionalised with three anionic
   surfactants - sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate
   and sodium deoxycholate - was evaluated with time-resolved dynamic light
   scattering. A wide range of mono- (NaCl) and divalent (CaCl2)
   electrolytes as well as a 2.5mg total organic carbon (TOC) L-1 Suwannee
   River humic acid were used as background chemistry. Overall, sodium
   dodecyl benzene sulfonate showed the most effectiveness in stabilising
   SWNTs, followed by sodium deoxycholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate.
   However, the larger diameter (7,6) chirality tubes (compared to (6,5)
   diameter), compromised the surfactant stability due to enhanced van der
   Waals interaction. The presence of divalent electrolytes overshadowed
   the chirality effects and resulted in similar aggregation behaviour for
   both the SWNT samples. Molecular modelling results elucidated key
   differences in surfactant conformation on SWNT surfaces and identified
   interaction energy changes between the two chiralities to delineate
   aggregation mechanisms. The stability of SWNTs increased in the presence
   of Suwannee River humic acid under 10mM monovalent and mixed-electrolyte
   conditions. The results suggest that change in chirality can overcome
   surfactant stabilisation of semiconducting SWNTs. SWNT stability can
   also be strongly influenced by the anionic surfactant structure.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear systems, a category into which essentially all real-world
   engineering systems fall, are challenging in their design, response
   prediction, and control. Simulating their dynamic response requires
   numerical solvers, and the use of frequency-domain techniques is
   prohibited, which eliminates many commonly used engineering techniques.
   Subspace identification is a convenient method to approximate a complex,
   nonlinear system with a linear model, significantly enhancing simulation
   time and allowing the use of traditional control schemes. This paper
   investigates the utility of subspace identification for the National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW reference model, which runs on
   their open-source wind turbine simulator, FAST. The ability of the
   identified model to predict a variety of outputs is compared. The linear
   models found with subspace identification are used to create a simple
   gain-scheduled controller, and its performance is compared with the
   standard NREL 5 MW controller.}},

Abstract = {{Urban heat island (UHI) manifests as the temperature rise in built-up
   urban areas relative to the surrounding rural countryside, largely
   because of the relatively greater proportion of incident solar energy
   that is absorbed and stored by man-made materials. The direct impact of
   UHI can be significant on both daytime and night-time temperatures, and
   the indirect impacts include increased air conditioning loads,
   deteriorated air and water quality, reduced pavement lifetimes, and
   exacerbated heat waves. Modifying the thermal properties and emissivity
   of roofs and paved surfaces and increasing the vegetated area within the
   city are potential mitigation strategies. A quantitative comparison of
   their efficacies and costs suggests that so-called cool roofs are likely
   the most cost-effective UHI mitigation strategy. However, additional
   research is needed on how to modify surface emissivities and dynamically
   control surface and material properties, as well as on the health and
   socioeconomic impacts of UHI.}},

   Wave Propagation on the Purkinje System}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A both space and time adaptive algorithm is presented for simulating
   electrical wave propagation in the Purkinje system of the heart. The
   equations governing the distribution of electric potential over the
   system are solved in time with the method of lines. At each timestep, by
   an operator splitting technique, the space-dependent but linear
   diffusion part and the nonlinear but space-independent reactions part in
   the partial differential equations are integrated separately with
   implicit schemes, which have better stability and allow larger timesteps
   than explicit ones. The linear diffusion equation on each edge of the
   system is spatially discretized with the continuous piecewise linear
   finite element method. The adaptive algorithm can automatically
   recognize when and where the electrical wave starts to leave or enter
   the computational domain due to external current/voltage stimulation,
   self-excitation, or local change of membrane properties. Numerical
   examples demonstrating efficiency and accuracy of the adaptive algorithm
   are presented.}},

Abstract = {{We present a Bayesian non-negative tensor factorization model for
   count-valued tensor data, and develop scalable inference algorithms
   (both batch and online) for dealing with massive tensors. Our generative
   model can handle overdispersed counts as well as infer the rank of the
   decomposition. Moreover, leveraging a reparameterization of the Poisson
   distribution as a multinomial facilitates conjugacy in the model and
   enables simple and efficient Gibbs sampling and variational Bayes (VB)
   inference updates, with a computational cost that only depends on the
   number of nonzeros in the tensor. The model also provides a nice
   interpretability for the factors; in our model, each factor corresponds
   to a ``topic{''}. We develop a set of online inference algorithms that
   allow further scaling up the model to massive tensors, for which batch
   inference methods may be infeasible. We apply our framework on diverse
   real-world applications, such as multiway topic modeling on a scientific
   publications database, analyzing a political science data set, and
   analyzing a massive household transactions data set.}},

Abstract = {{The move towards extreme-scale computing platforms challenges scientific
   simulations in many ways. Given the recent tendencies in computer
   architecture development, one needs to reformulate legacy codes in order
   to cope with large amounts of communication, system faults, and
   requirements of low-memory usage per core. In this work, we develop a
   novel framework for solving PDEs via domain decomposition that
   reformulates the solution as a state of knowledge with a probabilistic
   interpretation. Such reformulation allows resiliency with respect to
   potential faults without having to apply fault detection, avoids
   unnecessary communication, and is generally well-suited for rigorous
   uncertainty quantification studies that target improvements of
   predictive fidelity of scientific models. We demonstrate our algorithm
   for one-dimensional PDE examples where artificial faults have been
   implemented as bit flips in the binary representation of subdomain
   solutions.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembly processes of polyelectrolyte block copolymers are
   ubiquitous in industrial and biological processes; understanding their
   physical properties can also provide insights into the design of
   polyelectrolyte materials with novel and tailored properties. Here, we
   report systematic analysis on how the ionic strength of the solvent and
   the length of the polyelectrolyte block affect the self-assembly and
   morphology of the polyelectrolyte block copolymer materials by
   constructing a salt-dependent morphological phase diagram using an
   implicit solvent ionic strength (ISIS) method for dissipative particle
   dynamics (DPD) simulations. This diagram permits the determination of
   the conditions for the morphological transition into a specific shape,
   namely vesicles or lamellar aggregates, wormlike/cylindrical micelles,
   and spherical micelles. The scaling behavior for the size of spherical
   micelles is predicted, in terms of radius of gyration (R-g,R- m) and
   thickness of corona (H-corona), as a function of solvent ionic strength
   (c(s)) and polyelectrolyte length (N-A), which are R-g,R- m similar to
   c(s)(-0.06)N(A)(0.54) and H-corona similar to c(s)(-0.11)N(A)(0.75). The
   simulation results were corroborated through AFM and static light
   scattering measurements on the example of the self-assembly of
   monodisperse, single-stranded DNA block-copolynucleotides
   (polyT50-b-F-dUTP). Overall, we were able to predict the salt-responsive
   morphology of polyelectrolyte materials in aqueous solution and show
   that a spherical-cylindrical-lamellar change in morphology can be
   obtained through an increase in solvent ionic strength or a decrease of
   polyelectrolyte length.}},

Abstract = {{The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (Syn or S) to form insoluble fibrils
   is important in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, but key risk
   factors remain ill-defined. We have developed Fluorescence Resonance
   Energy Transfer (FRET)-based assays for alpha-synuclein aggregation,
   using Green Fluorescent Protein variants Cerulean (C) or Venus (V),
   fused to each other (CV, VC) or to human synuclein (SC, SV etc).
   Bacterially expressed proteins were purified to homogeneity, and
   C-terminal fusions SC and SV largely retained their ability to aggregate
   in vitro. FRET signals from mixtures of SC and SV were used to monitor
   aggregation. These fusion genes were linked to the C. elegans unc-54
   myosin promoter to generate integrated transgenic strains. Increased
   FRET signals, indicative of S aggregation, were observed following
   treatment of unc-54::SC + unc-54::SV double transgenic worms with low
   concentrations of mercury or chlorpyrifos, or with RNAi against hsp-70
   and hip-1. Opposite changes in Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP)
   fluorescence in an unc-54::SV strain (NL5901) are likely to reflect FRET
   from Yellow Fluorescent Protein to aggregates of Syn fusion protein.
   This could provide the basis for a high throughput screening assay,
   which could be used for studying the effects of toxic chemicals and
   environmental pollutants on the aggregation of proteins such as Syn in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Streaming heterogeneous information is ubiquitous in the era of Big
   Data, which provides versatile perspectives for more comprehensive
   understanding of behaviors of an underlying system/process. Human
   analysis of these volumes is infeasible, leading to unprecedented
   demands for mathematical tools which effectively parse and distill such
   data. However, the complicated nature of streaming heterogeneous data
   prevents the conventional multivariate data analysis methods being
   applied immediately. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
   together with an online algorithm, denoted as LSTH, for latent space
   tracking from heterogeneous data. Our method leverages the advantages of
   dimension reduction, correlation analysis and sparse learning to better
   reveal the latent relations among heterogeneous information and adapt to
   slow variations in streaming data. We applied our method on both
   synthetic and real data, and it achieves results competitive with or
   superior to the state-of-the-art in detecting several different types of
   anomalies.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement matrix employed in compressive sensing typically cannot
   be known precisely a priori and must be estimated via calibration. One
   may take multiple compressive measurements, from which the measurement
   matrix and underlying signals may be estimated jointly. This is of
   interest as well when the measurement matrix may change as a function of
   the details of what is measured. This problem has been considered
   recently for Gaussian measurement noise, and here we develop this idea
   with application to Poisson systems. A collaborative maximum likelihood
   algorithm and alternating proximal gradient algorithm are proposed, and
   associated theoretical performance guarantees are established based on
   newly derived concentration-of-measure results. A Bayesian model is then
   introduced, to improve flexibility and generality. Connections between
   the maximum likelihood methods and the Bayesian model are developed, and
   example results are presented for a real compressive X-ray imaging
   system.}},

Title = {{Alternating Minimization Algorithm with Automatic Relevance
   Determination for Transmission Tomography under Poisson Noise}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{2087-2132}},
Abstract = {{We propose a globally convergent alternating minimization (AM) algorithm
   for image reconstruction in transmission tomography, which extends
   automatic relevance determination (ARD) to Poisson noise models with
   Beer's law. The algorithm promotes solutions that are sparse in the
   pixel/voxel-difference domain by introducing additional latent
   variables, one for each pixel/voxel, and then learning these variables
   from the data using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Importantly, the
   proposed AM algorithm is free of any tuning parameters with image
   quality comparable to standard penalized likelihood methods. Our
   algorithm exploits optimization transfer principles which reduce the
   problem into parallel one-dimensional optimization tasks (one for each
   pixel/voxel), making the algorithm feasible for large-scale problems.
   This approach considerably reduces the computational bottleneck of ARD
   associated with the posterior variances. Positivity constraints inherent
   in transmission tomography problems are also enforced. We demonstrate
   the performance of the proposed algorithm for x-ray computed tomography
   using synthetic and real-world datasets. The algorithm is shown to have
   much better performance than prior ARD algorithms based on approximate
   Gaussian noise models, even for high photon flux. Sample code is
   available from http://www.yankaganovsky.com/\#!code/c24bp.}},

Pages = {{2133-2159}},
Abstract = {{Two complementary approaches have been extensively used in signal and
   image processing leading to novel results, the sparse representation
   methodology and the variational strategy. Recently, a new sparsity based
   model has been proposed, the cosparse analysis framework, which may
   potentially help in bridging sparse approximation based methods to the
   traditional total-variation minimization. Based on this, we introduce a
   sparsity based framework for solving overparameterized variational
   problems. The latter has been used to improve the estimation of optical
   flow and also for general denoising of signals and images. However, the
   recovery of the space varying parameters involved was not adequately
   addressed by traditional variational methods. We first demonstrate the
   efficiency of the new framework for one dimensional signals in
   recovering a piecewise linear and polynomial function. Then, we
   illustrate how the new technique can be used for denoising and
   segmentation of images.}},

Abstract = {{We present a facile method to induce J-aggregate formation on gold
   nanospheres in colloidal solution using polyvinylsulfate. The
   nanoparticle J-aggregate complex results in an absorption spectrum with
   a split lineshape due to plasmon-exciton coupling, i.e. via the
   formation of upper and lower plexcitonic branches. The use of
   nanoparticles with different plasmon resonances alters the position of
   the upper plexcitonic band while the lower band remains at the same
   wavelength. This splitting is investigated theoretically, and shown
   analytically to arise from Fano resonance between the plasmon of the
   gold nanoparticles and exciton of the J-aggregates. A theoretical
   simulation of a J-aggregate coated and uncoated gold nanosphere produces
   an absorption spectrum that shows good agreement with the experimentally
   measured spectra.}},

Abstract = {{The marine sponge Hippospongia communis (Demospongiae: Porifera) is a
   representative of bath sponges, which possess characteristic
   mineral-free fibrous skeletons made of a structural protein - spongin.
   This fibrous skeleton is mechanically robust, resistant to acidic
   treatment, and thermally stable up to 160 degrees C. Due to these
   properties, we decided to use this biological material for the first
   time for the hydrothermal synthesis of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) via
   catalyzed hydrolysis of FeCl3 to obtain a hematite-spongin composite.
   The material obtained was studied with Scanning Electron Microscopy
   (SEM), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray
   Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The
   alpha-Fe2O3-spongin-based composite was tested for its potential
   application as an anode material in a capacitor. The results indicate
   that components constructed using this novel composite material have a
   positive effect on the capacitance of energy storing devices.}},

Title = {{Relative contributions of mercury bioavailability and microbial growth
   rate on net methylmercury production by anaerobic mixed cultures}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1568-1577}},
Abstract = {{Monomethylmercury (MeHg) is produced in many aquatic environments by
   anaerobic microorganisms that take up and methylate inorganic forms of
   Hg(II). Net methylation of Hg(II) appears to be correlated with factors
   that affect the activity of the anaerobic microbial community and
   factors that increase the bioavailability of Hg(II) to these organisms.
   However, the relative importance of one versus the other is difficult to
   elucidate even though this information can greatly assist remediation
   efforts and risk assessments. Here, we investigated the effects of Hg
   speciation (dissolved Hg and nanoparticulate HgS) and microbial activity
   on the net production of MeHg using two mixed microbial cultures that
   were enriched from marine sediments under sulfate reducing conditions.
   The cultures were amended with dissolved Hg (added as a dissolved
   nitrate salt) and nanoparticulate HgS, and grown under different carbon
   substrate concentrations. The results indicated that net mercury
   methylation was the highest for cultures incubated in the greatest
   carbon substrate concentration (60 mM) compared to incubations with less
   carbon (0.6 and 6 mM), regardless of the form of mercury amended. Net
   MeHg production in cultures exposed to HgS nanoparticles was
   significantly slower than in cultures exposed to dissolved Hg; however,
   the difference diminished with slower growing cultures with low carbon
   addition (0.6 mM). The net Hg methylation rate was found to correlate
   with sulfate reduction rate in cultures exposed to dissolved Hg, while
   methylation rate was roughly constant for cultures exposed to
   nanoparticulate HgS. These results indicated a potential threshold of
   microbial productivity: below this point net MeHg production was limited
   by microbial activity, regardless of Hg bioavailability. Above this
   threshold of productivity, Hg speciation became a contributing factor
   towards net MeHg production.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{Diamond has long been of interest as a biomaterial due to its expected
   biocompatibility and chemical stability. Progress in surface
   functionalization of diamond and diamond electrochemistry has extended
   this interest to use as a biosensor platform. The sensitivity and
   selectivity of the diamond surface can be enhanced by covalently
   attaching carbon-based biochemicals. In this communication, an
   amine-thiol molecule was attached to a boron-doped diamond (BDD) surface
   to produce an enhanced ability to detect NO species. In the case of
   hydrogen terminated BDD, it was found that NO (aqueous) oxidation was
   insufficiently distinct to electrochemically detect NO. However, the
   amine-thiol functionalized BDD surface provided a distinct oxidation
   peak from 65 nanomolar to 236 nanomolar concentrations. Multiple cyclic
   voltammagrams with amine-thiol functionalized BDD electrode in
   (HPLC-quality) purified water indicated that the covalently attached
   surface molecules resisted decomposition during both anodic and cathodic
   polarization. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS. All rights

Abstract = {{Coal is a major energy source worldwide and is a large fraction of the
   total energy production in the US. The disposal of coal combustion
   residuals (CCRs) into landfills and surface impoundments present an
   environmental challenge given the high levels of toxic metals in CCRs
   that are highly mobile into the aquatic phase. Here we present the
   lithium isotope composition of coals and CCRs originated from several
   U.S. basins. delta Li-7 values in CCR leachates from the Appalachian
   Basin, the Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin vary from -7 parts
   per thousand to + 12.8 parts per thousand, with an average of +/- 1.6
   +/- 5.0\%. CCR's from the Powder River Basin had a higher delta Li-7 of
   7.6 +/- 5.4 parts per thousand compared to the Appalachian and Illinois
   Basins (+0.3 +/- 6.6\% and -0.1 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand,
   respectively). Effluents from six coal ash ponds in North Carolina show
   a similar range in lithium isotopes (delta Li-7 = -6.2 to +8.7 parts per
   thousand) suggesting limited lithium isotope fractionation during
   storage in surface impoundment. We show that lithium isotopes,
   particularly when coupled with boron isotopes, could distinguish CCR
   contaminants from oil and gas wastewater, including conventional
   produced waters and hydraulic fracturing fluids. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Optical haze is one of the most important factors to be considered in
   the development of efficient photonic and optoelectronic devices by
   manipulating the light behavior. In this work, we fabricated a high
   optical haze film composed of self-aggregated alumina nanowire arrays
   and applied this novel structure to improve the energy conversion
   efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. We controlled the
   optical properties of films, such as total/diffuse transmittance and
   haze value, by changing the packing density of nanowires during the wet
   etching process. By optimizing the etching conditions, the nanowire
   bundle arrays enabled us to obtain an ultrahigh optical haze value up to
   similar to 98\% or high transmittance up to similar to 96\%. By simply
   attaching the haze film onto the front glass surface of the OPV device,
   we significantly elongated the optical path length in the active layer,
   thereby achieving an overall efficiency of 9.01\% out of the bare device
   of 8.17\%, resulting in 10.28\% enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Resonantly enhanced transmission through subwavelength periodic
   structure in metallic film has received much attention since the
   phenomenon of extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) was discovered by
   Ebbesen in 1998. A variety of novel phenomena caused by the interaction
   of light with metallic film, the surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) plays
   a crucial role. The research work about the phenomenon of SPP has been
   focused on relatively thick metallic films, while ultrathin films with
   the thickness smaller or comparable to the skin depth are almost
   neglected. Therefore, a series of ultrathin gold films with hexagonal
   arrays of subwavelength holes of various hole diameters have been
   fabricated using nanosphere lithography technique and oxygen reactive
   ion etching. Their optical transmittances are measured and compared with
   the simulated results using the FDTD method. The experimental and
   measurement results demonstrate that the transmittance spectra can be
   precisely engineered by tuning the geometry parameters of the
   nanostructures. These investigations provide a guide for the design and
   fabrication of transparent electrodes based on ultrathin metal films.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomedicine has attracted increasing attention in recent years, because
   it offers great promise to provide personalized diagnostics and therapy
   with improved treatment efficacy and specificity. In this study, we
   developed a gold nanostar (GNS) probe for multi-modality theranostics
   including surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection, x-ray
   computed tomography (CT), two-photon luminescence (TPL) imaging, and
   photothermal therapy (PTT). We performed radiolabeling, as well as CT
   and optical imaging, to investigate the GNS probe's biodistribution and
   intratumoral uptake at both macroscopic and microscopic scales. We also
   characterized the performance of the GNS nanoprobe for in vitro
   photothermal heating and in vivo photothermal ablation of primary
   sarcomas in mice. The results showed that 30-nm GNS have higher tumor
   uptake, as well as deeper penetration into tumor interstitial space
   compared to 60-nm GNS. In addition, we found that a higher injection
   dose of GNS can increase the percentage of tumor uptake. We also
   demonstrated the GNS probe's superior photothermal conversion efficiency
   with a highly concentrated heating effect due to a tip-enhanced
   plasmonic effect. In vivo photothermal therapy with a near-infrared
   (NIR) laser under the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) led to ablation
   of aggressive tumors containing GNS, but had no effect in the absence of
   GNS. This multifunctional GNS probe has the potential to be used for in
   vivo biosensing, preoperative CT imaging, intraoperative detection with
   optical methods (SERS and TPL), as well as image-guided photothermal
   therapy.}},

   bandwidth of more than 30\% (8.2-11.4 GHz) and the port isolation is
   larger than 20 dB over that band. This antenna has a relatively simple

Abstract = {{The electrical signal originating from the heart, the electrocardiogram
   (ECG), has been examined for its potential use as a biometric. Recent
   ECG studies have shown that an intersession authentication performance
   <6\% equal error rate (EER) can be achieved using training data from two
   days while testing with data from a third day. More recently, a
   mechanical measurement of cardiovascular activity, the laser Doppler
   vibrometry (LDV) signal, was proposed by our group as a biometric trait.
   The intersession authentication performance of the LDV biometric system
   is comparable to that of the ECG biometric system. Combining both the
   electrical and mechanical aspects of the cardiovascular system, an
   overall improvement in authentication performance can be attained. In
   particular, the multibiometric system achieves similar to 2\% EER.
   Moreover, in the identification mode, with a testing database containing
   200 individuals, the rank-1 accuracy improves from similar to 80\% for
   each individual biometric system, to similar to 92\% for the
   multibiometric system. Although there are implementation issues that
   would need to be resolved before this combined method could be applied
   in the field, this report establishes the basis and utility of the
   method in principle, and it identifies effective signal analysis
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene/metal heterojunctions are ubiquitous in graphene-based devices
   and, therefore, have attracted increasing interest of researchers.
   Indeed, the literature on the field reports apparently contradictory
   results about the effect of a metal on graphene doping. Here, we
   elucidate the effect of metal nanostructuring and oxidation on the metal
   work function (WF) and, consequently, on the charge transfer and doping
   of graphene/metal hybrids. We show that nanostructuring and oxidation of
   metals provide a valid support to frame WF and doping variation in
   metal/graphene hybrids. Chemical vapour-deposited monolayer graphene has
   been transferred onto a variety of metal surfaces, including d-metals,
   such as Ag, Au, and Cu, and sp-metals, such as Al and Ga, configured as
   thin films or nanoparticle (NP) ensembles of various average sizes. The
   metal-induced charge transfer and the doping of graphene have been
   investigated using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and
   corroborated by Raman spectroscopy and plasmonic ellipsometric
   spectroscopy. We show that when the appropriate WF of the metal is
   considered, without any assumption, taking into account WF variations by
   nanostructure and/or oxidation, a linear relationship between the metal
   WF and the doping of graphene is found. Specifically, for all metals,
   nanostructuring lowers the metal WF. In addition, using gold as an
   example, a critical metal nanoparticle size is found at which the
   direction of charge transfer, and consequently graphene doping, is
   inverted.}},

Abstract = {{The development of sensitive and selective techniques for multiplex
   detection of DNA biomarkers is paramount for clinical diagnosis. Various
   multiplex DNA detection techniques have been reported. However, most of
   these techniques require multiple incubation and/or washing steps or
   target sequence labeling. In this work, we demonstrated a unique
   multiplex DNA biosensor for viral infection diagnosis using the
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) ``Molecular
   Sentinel-on-Chip{''} (MSC) technique. The sensing mechanism is based
   upon the change of SERS intensity when Raman labels tagged at 3'-ends of
   molecular sentinel nanoprobes are physically displaced from the Nanowave
   chip's surface upon target DNA hybridization. SERS measurements were
   performed immediately following a single hybridization reaction between
   the target single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences and the complementary
   molecular sentinel nanoprobes immobilized on the Nanowave chip without
   requiring target labeling (i.e., label-free assay), secondary
   hybridization, or post-hybridization washing, thus reducing the assay
   time and lowering cost. Two nucleic acid transcripts, interferon
   alpha-inducible protein 27 (IFI27) and interferon-induced protein
   44-like (IFI44L), are used as model systems for the multiplex detection
   concept demonstration. These two genes are well known for their critical
   role in host immune response to viral infections and can be used as
   molecular signature for viral infection diagnosis. The results indicate
   the effectiveness and potential of the MSC technology for multiplex DNA
   detection for point-of-care diagnostics and global health applications.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of a unique hybrid nanoplatform consisting of
   silver-embedded gold nanostars that entraps a reference dye between the
   gold and silver surfaces, providing an internal reference signal for
   quantitative surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) analysis without

   SERS enhancement in a non-aggregated state for analytes on the exterior
   surface of the particle. When an equivalent structure was created using
   gold nanospheres as the core, no SERS signal from the analyte was
   observed until aggregation was induced by the addition of salt.
   Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) was used as a model analyte to demonstrate this
   proof of concept. The use of the internal standard to reduce SERS signal
   variability was demonstrated in a highly scattering medium and at
   various particle concentrations, to simulate conditions that may be
   encountered with real-world samples. This novel, internal reference

Abstract = {{The programmed self-assembly of block copolymers into higher order
   nanoscale structures offers many attractive attributes for the
   development of new nanomaterials for numerous applications including
   drug delivery and biosensing. The incorporation of biomimetic silaffin
   peptides in these block copolymers enables the formation of hybrid
   organic-inorganic materials, which can potentially enhance the utility
   and stability of self-assembled nanostructures. We demonstrate the
   design, synthesis and characterization of amphiphilic elastin-like
   polypeptide (ELP) diblock copolymers that undergo temperature-triggered
   self-assembly into well-defined spherical micelles. Genetically encoded
   incorporation of the silaffin R5 peptide at the hydrophilic terminus of
   the diblock ELP leads to presentation of the silaffin R5 peptide on the
   coronae of the micelles, which results in localized condensation of
   silica and the formation of near-monodisperse, discrete, sub-100 nm
   diameter hybrid ELP-silica particles. This synthesis method, can be
   carried out under mild reaction conditions suitable for bioactive
   materials, and will serve as the basis for the development and
   application of functional nanomaterials. Beyond silicification, the
   general strategies described herein may also be adapted for the
   synthesis of other biohybrid nanomaterials as well.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides an overview of recent developments and
   applications of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanosensors and
   nanoreporters in our laboratory for use in biochemical monitoring,
   medical diagnostics, and therapy. The design and fabrication of
   different types of plasmonics-active nanostructures are discussed. The
   SERS nanosensors can be used in various applications including pH
   sensing, protein detection, and gene diagnostics. For DNA detection the
   Molecular Sentinel' nanoprobe can be used as a homogenous bioassay in
   solution or on a chip platform. Gold nanostars provide an excellent
   multi-modality theranostic platform, combining Raman and SERS with
   two-photon luminescence (TPL) imaging as well as photodynamic therapy
   (PDT), and photothermal therapy (PTT). Plasmonics-enhanced and optically
   modulated delivery of nanostars into brain tumor in live animals was
   demonstrated; photothermal treatment of tumor vasculature may induce
   inflammasome activation, thus increasing the permeability of the blood
   brain-tumor barrier. The imaging method using TPL of gold nanostars
   provides an unprecedented spatial selectivity for enhanced targeted
   nanostar delivery to cortical tumor tissue. A quintuple-modality
   nanoreporter based on gold nanostars for SERS, TPL, magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and PTT has recently been
   developed. The possibility of combining spectral selectivity and high
   sensitivity of the SERS process with the inherent molecular specificity
   of bioreceptor-based nanoprobes provides a unique multiplex and
   selective diagnostic modality. Several examples of optical detection
   using SERS in combination with other detection and treatment modalities
   are discussed to illustrate the usefulness and potential of SERS
   nanosensors and nanoreporters for medical applications. WIREs Nanomed

Abstract = {{Post-traumatic arthritis (PTA) is a rapidly progressive form of
   arthritis that develops due to joint injury, including articular
   fracture. Current treatments are limited to surgical restoration and
   stabilization of the joint; however, evidence suggests that PTA
   progression is mediated by the upregulation of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha). Although these cytokines provide potential therapeutic
   targets for PTA, intra-articular injections of anti-cytokine therapies
   have proven difficult due to rapid clearance from the joint space. In
   this study, we examined the ability of a cross-linked elastin-like
   polypeptide (xELP) drug depot to provide sustained intra-articular
   delivery of IL-1 and TNF-alpha inhibitors as a beneficial therapy. Mice
   sustained a closed intra-articular tibial plateau fracture; treatment
   groups received a single intra-articular injection of drug encapsulated
   in xELP. Arthritic changes were assessed 4 and 8 weeks after fracture.
   Inhibition of IL-1 significantly reduced the severity of cartilage
   degeneration and synovitis. Inhibition of TNF-alpha alone or with IL-1
   led to deleterious effects in bone morphology, articular cartilage
   degeneration, and synovitis. These findings suggest that IL-1 plays a
   critical role in the pathogenesis of PTA following articular fracture,
   and sustained intra-articular cytokine inhibition may provide a
   therapeutic approach for reducing or preventing joint degeneration
   following trauma.}},

Abstract = {{Forward-looking ground penetrating radar (FLGPR) is a remote sensing
   modality that has recently been investigated for buried threat
   detection. FLGPR offers greater standoff than other downward-looking
   modalities such as electromagnetic induction and downward-looking GPR,
   but it suffers from high false alarm rates due to surface and ground
   clutter. A stepped frequency FLGPR system consists of multiple radars
   with varying polarizations and bands, each of which interacts
   differently with subsurface materials and therefore might potentially be
   able to discriminate clutter from true buried targets. However, it is
   unclear which combinations of bands and polarizations would be most
   useful for discrimination or how to fuse them. This work applies sparse
   structured basis pursuit, a supervised statistical model which searches
   for sets of bands that are collectively effective for discriminating
   clutter from targets. The algorithm works by trying to minimize the
   number of selected items in a dictionary of signals; in this case the
   separate bands and polarizations make up the dictionary elements. A
   structured basis pursuit algorithm is employed to gather groups of modes
   together in collections to eliminate whole polarizations or sensors. The
   approach is applied to a large collection of FLGPR data for data around
   emplaced target and non-target clutter. The results show that a sparse
   structure basis pursuits outperforms a conventional CFAR anomaly
   detector while also pruning out unnecessary bands of the FLGPR sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-penetrating radar (CPR) technology has proven capable of
   detecting buried threats. The system relies on a binary classifier that,
   is trained to distinguish between two classes: a target class,
   encompassing, many types of buried threats and their components; and a
   nontarget class, which includes false alarms from the system
   prescreener. Typically, the training process involves a simple partition
   of the data into these two classes, which allows for straightforward
   application of standard classifiers. However, since training data is
   generally collected in fully controlled environments, it includes
   auxiliary information about each example, such as the specific type of
   threat, its purpose, its components, and its depth. Examples from the
   same specific or general type may be expected to exhibit similarities in
   their GPR data, whereas examples from different types may differ
   greatly. This research aims to leverage this additional information to
   improve overall classification performance by fusing classifier concepts
   for niultiple groups, and to in whether structure in this information
   can be further utilized for transfer learning, such that the amount of
   expensive training data necessary to learn a new, previously-unseen
   target type may be reduced. Methods for accomplishing these goals are
   presented with results from a dataset containing a variety of target
   types.}},

Abstract = {{A goal of ground penetrating radar (GPR) preprocessing is to distinguish
   background from data containing explosive threats. This is commonly
   achieved by performing depth-dependent mean and standard deviation
   normalization, where the mean and standard deviation are computed on
   background data. Under the assumption that data with explosive threats
   have different statistical characteristics than the background/clutter,
   after normalization explosive threat data will have larger absolute
   normalized scores than the background/clutter. An underlying problem is
   determining which data to compute the background mean and standard
   deviation statistics over. Often the background statistics are computed
   over a moving window, which is centered at the location of interest and
   has a predetermined guard band, a region of data that is ignored.
   However, buried explosive threats vary considerably in their shapes and
   more importantly sizes subsequently, the size of the GPR responses from
   these objects are considerably varied. We examine a number of additional
   detection methods that utilize Robust Principal Component Analysis
   (RPCA), where RPCA decomposes the data into low-rank and sparse
   components. Intuitively, the low-rank component should capture the
   background data and the sparse should capture the anomalous explosive
   threat response. We find that detection performance using energy- and
   shape-based detection algorithms improves when using RPCA preprocessing.}},

Abstract = {{Many remote sensing modalities have been developed for buried target
   detection, each one offering its own relative advantages over the
   others. As a result there has been interest in combining several
   modalities into a single detection platform that benefits from the
   advantages of each constituent sensor, without suffering from their
   weaknesses. Traditionally this involves collecting data continuously on
   all sensors and then performing data, feature, or decision level fusion.
   While this is effective for lowering false alarm rates, this strategy
   neglects the potential benefits of a more general system-level fusion
   architecture. Such an architecture can involve dynamically changing
   which modalities are in operation. For example, a large standoff
   modality such as a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera can be
   employed until an alarm is encountered, at which point a high
   performance (but short standoff) sensor, such as ground penetrating
   radar (GPR), is employed. Because the system is dynamically changing its
   rate of advance and sensors, it becomes difficult to evaluate the
   expected false alarm rate and advance rate. In this work, a
   probabilistic model is proposed that can be used to estimate these
   quantities based on a provided operating policy. In this model the
   system consists of a set of states (e.g., sensors employed) and
   conditions encountered (e.g., alarm locations). The predictive accuracy
   of the model is evaluated using a collection of collocated FLIR and GPR
   data and the results indicate that the model is effective at predicting
   the desired system metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Improved performance in the discrimination of buried threats using
   Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data has recently been achieved using
   features developed for applications in computer vision. These features,
   designed to characterize local shape information in images, have been
   utilized to recognize patches that contain a target signature in
   two-dimensional slices of GPR data. While these adapted features perform
   very well in this GPR application, they were not designed to
   specifically differentiate between target responses and background GPR
   data. One option for developing a feature specifically designed for
   target differentiation is to manually design a feature extractor based
   on the physics of GPR image formation. However, as seen in the
   historical progression of computer vision features, this is not a
   trivial task. Instead, this research evaluates the use of convolutional
   neural networks (CNNs) applied to two-dimensional GPR data. The benefit
   of using a CNN is that features extracted from the data are a learned
   parameter of the system. This has allowed CNN implementations to achieve
   state of the art performance across a variety of data types, including
   visual images, without the need for expert designed features. However,
   the implementation of a CNN must be done carefully for each application
   as network parameters can cause performance to vary widely. This paper
   presents results from using CNNs for object detection in GPR data and
   discusses proper parameter settings and other considerations.}},

Abstract = {{A fast and accurate scatter imaging technique to differentiate cancerous
   and healthy breast tissue is introduced in this work. Such a technique
   would have wide-ranging clinical applications from intra-operative
   margin assessment to breast cancer screening. Coherent Scatter Computed
   Tomography (CSCT) has been shown to differentiate cancerous from healthy
   tissue, but the need to raster scan a pencil beam at a series of angles
   and slices in order to reconstruct 3D images makes it prohibitively time
   consuming. In this work we apply the coded aperture coherent scatter
   spectral imaging technique to reconstruct 3D images of breast tissue
   samples from experimental data taken without the rotation usually
   required in CSCT. We present our experimental implementation of coded
   aperture scatter imaging, the reconstructed images of the breast tissue
   samples and segmentations of the 3D images in order to identify the
   cancerous and healthy tissue inside of the samples.
   We find that coded aperture scatter imaging is able to reconstruct
   images of the samples and identify the distribution of cancerous and
   healthy tissues (i.e., fibroglandular, adipose, or a mix of the two)
   inside of them. Coded aperture scatter imaging has the potential to
   provide scatter images that automatically differentiate cancerous and
   healthy tissue inside of ex vivo samples within a time on the order of a
   minute.}},

Abstract = {{A novel breast CT system capable of traversing non-traditional 3D
   trajectories was developed to address cone beam sampling insufficiency
   for pendant breast imaging. The purpose of this study was to
   characterize differences in three dimensional x-ray dose distributions
   in a target volume due to the acquisition trajectory. Three cylindrical
   phantoms of different diameters and an anthropomorphic breast phantom
   were scanned in a pendant geometry with two orbitsazimuthal orbit with
   no polar tilt, and a saddle orbit with +/- 15 degrees contiguous polar
   tilts. The phantoms were initially filled with water and then with a
   75:25\% water: methanol mixture, to simulate different density breast
   tissues. Fully-3D CT scans were performed using a tungsten anode x-ray
   source. Ionization chamber calibrated radiochromic film was used to
   determine average dose delivered to the central sagittal slice of a
   volume, as well as to visualize the 2D dose distribution across the
   slice. Results indicated that the mean glandular dose for normal imaging
   exposures, measured at the central slice across different diameters
   ranged from 3.93-5.28 mGy, with the lowest average dose measured on the
   largest diameter cylinder. In all cases, the dose delivered by the
   saddle was consistently 1-3\% lower than the no-tilt scans. These
   results corroborate previous cylinder Monte Carlo studies which showed a
   1\% reduction in saddle dose. The average dose measured in the breast
   phantom filled with 75:25 mixture was slightly higher for saddle.
   Non-traditional 3D breast CT scans have slightly better dose performance
   for equal image noise compared with simple, under sampled circular
   orbits.}},

Abstract = {{Among the various metrics that quantify radiation dose in computed
   tomography (CT), organ dose is one of the most representative quantities
   reflecting patient-specific radiation burden. 1 Accurate estimation of
   organ dose requires one to effectively model the patient anatomy and the
   irradiation field. As illustrated in previous studies, the patient
   anatomy factor can be modeled using a library of computational phantoms
   with representative body habitus. 2 However, the modeling of irradiation
   field can be practically challenging, especially for CT exams performed
   with tube current modulation. The central challenge is to effectively
   quantify the scatter irradiation field created by the dynamic change of
   tube current. In this study, we present a convolution-based technique to
   effectively quantify the primary and scatter irradiation field for TCM
   examinations. The organ dose for a given clinical patient can then be
   rapidly determined using the convolution-based method, a
   patient-matching technique, and a library of computational phantoms.
   58 adult patients were included in this study (age range: 18-70 y.o.,
   weight range: 60-180 kg). One computational phantom was created based on
   the clinical images of each patient. Each patient was optimally matched
   against one of the remaining 57 computational phantoms using a
   leave-one-out strategy. For each computational phantom, the organ dose
   coefficients (CTDIvol-normalized organ dose) under fixed tube current
   were simulated using a validated Monte Carlo simulation program. Such
   organ dose coefficients were multiplied by a scaling factor,
   (CTDIvol)(organ, convolution) that quantifies the regional irradiation
   field. The convolution-based organ dose was compared with the organ dose
   simulated from Monte Carlo program with TCM profiles explicitly modeled
   on the original phantom created based on patient images. The estimation
   error was within 10\% across all organs and modulation profiles for
   abdominopelvic examination. This strategy enables prospective and
   retrospective patient-specific dose estimation without the need of Monte
   Carlo simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Cell differentiation is the foundation for tissue development and
   regeneration, disease modeling, and cell-based therapies. Although the
   differentiation of cell populations has been extensively studied in many
   systems, much less is known about the distribution of decision making of
   single cells within these populations. To characterize the
   differentiation of single skeletal muscle cells, we used single-molecule
   mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to precisely quantify
   the expression levels of the master myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and
   myogenin in individual myoblasts. We identified distinct cell states
   characterized by the number of myogenin transcripts expressed by a cell,
   with myoblasts stochastically transitioning to a myogenin-high state
   during differentiation. We also used MyoD overexpression to force the
   transdifferentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells into an induced myoblast
   phenotype. These reprogrammed cells revealed the presence of a critical
   threshold of MyoD expression required to initiate myogenin expression.
   These results provide quantitative single-molecule data to support the
   model of switch-like cell decision making and lineage specification.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an alternating minimization (AM) algorithm for estimating
   attenuation functions in x-ray transmission tomography using priors that
   promote sparsity in the pixel/voxel differences domain. As opposed to
   standard maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation, we use the automatic
   relevance determination (ARD) framework. In the ARD approach, sparsity
   (or compressibility) is promoted by introducing latent variables which
   serve as the weights of quadratic penalties, with one weight for each
   pixel/voxel; these weights are then automatically learned from the data.
   This leads to an algorithm where the quadratic penalty is reweighted in
   order to effectively promote sparsity. In addition to the usual object
   estimate, ARD also provides measures of uncertainty (posterior
   variances) which are used at each iteration to automatically determine
   the trade-off between data fidelity and the prior, thus potentially
   circumventing the need for any tuning parameters. We apply the convex
   decomposition lemma in a novel way and derive a separable surrogate
   function that leads to a parallel algorithm. We propose an extension of
   branchless distance-driven forward/back-projections which allows us to
   considerably speed up the computations associated with the posterior
   variances. We also study the acceleration of the algorithm using ordered
   subsets.}},

Abstract = {{Solid state Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) gamma cameras for SPECT imaging
   offer significantly improved energy resolution compared to traditional
   scintillation detectors. However, the photopeak resolution is often
   asymmetric due to incomplete charge collection within the detector,
   resulting in many photopeak events incorrectly sorted into lower energy
   bins ({''}tailing{''}). These misplaced events contaminate the true
   scatter signal, which may negatively impact scatter correction methods
   that rely on estimates of scatter from the spectra. Additionally,
   because CZT detectors are organized into arrays, each individual
   detector element may exhibit different degrees of tailing. Here, we
   present a modified dual-energy window scatter correction method for
   emission detection and imaging that attempts to account for
   position-dependent effects of incomplete charge collection in the CZT
   gamma camera of our dedicated breast SPECT-CT system. Point source
   measurements and geometric phantoms were used to estimate the impact of
   tailing on the scatter signal and extract a better estimate of the ratio
   of scatter within two energy windows. To evaluate the method,
   cylindrical phantoms with and without a separate fillable chamber were
   scanned to determine the impact on quantification in hot, cold, and
   uniform background regions. Projections were reconstructed using OSEM,
   and the results for the traditional and modified scatter correction
   methods were compared. Results show that while modest reduced
   quantification accuracy was observed in hot and cold regions of the
   multi-chamber phantoms, the modified scatter correction method yields up
   to 8\% improved quantification accuracy with 4\% less added noise than
   the traditional DEW method within uniform background regions.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional B-mode ultrasound images suffer from clutter composed of
   reverberation and aberration that exhibit only partial spatial
   coherence, making it possible to suppress these confounding signals
   using coherence-based imaging techniques. Coherence is typically
   measured by transmitting a focused wave into the tissue and computing
   the covariance of the returned echo signals across all combinations of
   receive channel pairs. We mathematically and experimentally prove the
   equivalence of the coherence measured as a function of transmit channel
   and as a function of receive channel. This forms the basis for an
   alternative method of coherence measurement using a synthetic aperture
   technique to store focused and summed receive channel data as a function
   of transmit channel. This technique avoids the need for access to
   individual receive channel data and is compatible with the existing
   signal pipeline on common commercial clinical scanners. We demonstrate
   in vivo short-lag spatial coherence imaging of the human liver to
   produce images with reduced clutter, using an ACUSON SC2000 ultrasound
   system to acquire data and perform full synthetic aperture focusing. The
   possibility to trade-off image quality for acquisition time is also
   presented in an effort to make the proposed sequences more accessible
   for real-time imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound imaging of deep targets is limited by the resolution of
   current ultrasound systems based on the available aperture size. We
   propose a system to synthesize an extended effective aperture in order
   to improve resolution and target detectability at depth using a
   precisely-tracked transducer swept across the region of interest. A
   Field II simulation was performed to demonstrate the swept aperture
   approach in both the spatial and frequency domains. The adaptively
   beamformed system was tested experimentally using a volumetric
   transducer and an ex vivo canine abdominal layer to evaluate the impact
   of clutter-generating tissue on the resulting point spread function.
   Resolution was improved by 73\% using a 30.8 degree sweep despite the
   presence of varying aberration across the array with an amplitude on the
   order of 100 ns. Slight variations were observed in the magnitude and
   position of side lobes compared to the control case, but overall image
   quality was not significantly degraded as compared by a simulation based
   on the experimental point spread function. We conclude that the swept
   aperture imaging system may be a valuable tool for synthesizing large
   effective apertures using conventional ultrasound hardware.}},

Abstract = {{The study presents a basic framework for structural integrity assessment
   using synthetic aperture focusing technique and the extended finite
   element method. Synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) is used to
   acquire detailed descriptions of three-dimensional flaws in engineering
   structures. Flaws extracted from SAFT can readily be represented as a
   surface mesh or a volume mesh. The mesh is integrated into a normal
   structural finite element model (FEM) via level set method to formulate
   an XFEM problem. Applying the cyclic fatigue load and solving the
   problem provides essential quantities for evaluation of the stress
   intensity factor (SIF), serving as a driven force of crack growth. The
   crack front is updated using crack growth equations, such as Paris'
   equation and its variants under cyclic loading condition. The result is
   considered to be accurate due to the fact that, for one thing it can
   minimize the uncertainty in quantification of three-dimensional flaws,
   and for another it provides a highly reliable solution to SIF for any
   point in the crack front under mixed mode loading conditions.
   Combination of the two components allows for removal of approximations
   and over conservativeness in conventional ultrasound based structural
   integrity assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Peripheral blood-derived endothelial cells (pBD-ECs) are an
   attractive tool for cell therapies and tissue engineering, but have been
   limited by their low isolation yield. We increase pBD-EC yield via
   administration of the chemokine receptor type 4 antagonist AMD3100, as
   well as via a diluted whole blood incubation (DWBI). Materials \&
   Methods: Porcine pBD-ECs were isolated using AMD3100 and DWBI and tested
   for EC markers, acetylated LDL uptake, growth kinetics, metabolic
   activity, flow-mediated nitric oxide production and seeded onto titanium
   tubes implanted into vessels of pigs. Results: DWBI increased the yield
   of porcine pBD-ECs 6.6-fold, and AMD3100 increased the yield 4.5-fold.
   AMD3100-mobilized ECs were phenotypically indistinguishable from
   nonmobilized ECs. In porcine implants, the cells expressed endothelial
   nitric oxide synthase, reduced thrombin-antithrombin complex
   systemically and prevented thrombosis. Conclusion: Administration of
   AMD3100 and the DWBI method both increase pBD-EC yield.}},

   incorporating DBT into radiology training programs is currently not well
   understood. The initial performance of a trainee in DBT might depend on
   the amount of previous radiology training, in particular breast imaging
   experience. In our study, we tested the DBT interpretive skills of
   radiology trainees with different levels of breast imaging training, but
   with no prior DBT experience. We recruited 16 radiology trainees to
   review 60 DBT studies. A fellowship-trained expert breast radiologist
   reviewed the studies and provided the gold standard interpretations.
   Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the
   performance of the trainees. Our results show that there is no notable
   difference in trainee performance in DBT, regardless of the number of
   years of general radiology experience. These results provide guidance to
   breast imaging educators as they prepare new curricula to teach DBT.
   These curricula should provide a base training which will likely be
   suitable for all trainee levels.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to compare CT low-contrast detectability as
   measured via human perception experiments with observer model surrogates

   designed with a range of low-contrast circular inserts representing 5
   contrast levels and 3 sizes. The phantom was imaged repeatedly (20
   times) on a third-generation dual-source CT scanner (SOMATOM Definition
   Force, Siemens Healthcare). Images were reconstructed at 0.6 mm slice
   thickness using filtered back projection (FBP) and advanced modeled
   iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) and were assessed by eleven blinded
   and independent readers using a two alternative forced choice (2AFC)
   detection experiment. The human scores were taken as the accuracy,
   averaged across observers. The predicted performance was computed
   directly from the images for several traditional image quality metrics
   and model observers including contrast to noise ratio (CNR), area
   weighted CNR (CNRa), non-prewhitening matched filter (NPW),
   non-prewhitening matched filter with an eye filter (NPWE), channelized
   Hotelling observer (CHO), and channelized Hotelling observer with
   internal noise (CHOi). The correlation between model observer
   predictions and human performance was assessed using linear regression
   analysis. The coefficient of determination (R-2) was used as
   goodness-of-fit metric to determine how well each model observer
   predicts human performance. R-2 was 0.11, 0.71, 0.73, 0.77, 0.60, and
   0.72 for CNR, CNRa, NPW, NPWE, CHO, and CHOi, respectively. The findings

Title = {{Tensile and fatigue behavior of layered acrylonitrile butadiene styrene}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{270-278}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to define the effect of specimen mesostructure
   on the monotonic tensile behavior and tensile-fatigue life of layered
   acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) components fabricated by fused
   deposition modeling (FDM).
   Design/methodology/approach - Tensile tests were performed on FDM
   dogbone specimens with four different raster orientations according to
   ASTM standard D638-03. Resulting ultimate tensile stresses (UTS) for
   each raster orientation were used to compute the maximum stress for
   fatigue testing, i.e. 90, 75, 60 and 50 or 45 per cent nominal values of
   the UTS. Multiple specimens were subjected to tension - tension fatigue
   cycling with stress ratio of R = 0.10 in accordance with ASTM standard
   D7791-12.
   Findings - Both tensile strength and fatigue performance exhibited
   anisotropic behavior. The longitudinal (0 degrees) and default (+45/-45
   degrees) raster orientations performed significantly better than the
   diagonal (45 degrees) or transverse (90 degrees) orientations in regards
   to fatigue life, as displayed in the resulting Wohler curves.
   Practical implications - Raster orientation has a significant effect on
   the fatigue performance of FDM ABS components. Aligning FDM fibers along
   the axis of the applied stress provides improved fatigue life. If the
   direction of applied stresses is not expected to be constant in given
   application, the default raster orientation is recommended.
   Originality/value - This project provides knowledge to the limited work
   published on the fatigue performance of FDM ABS components. It provides
   S-N fatigue life results that can serve as a foundation for future work,
   combining experimental investigations with theoretical principles and
   the statistical analysis of data.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac valvular stenosis, prolapse and regurgitation are increasingly
   common conditions, particularly in an elderly population with limited
   potential for on-pump cardiac surgery. NeoChord (c), MitraClip (c) and
   numerous stent-based transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
   devices provide an alternative to intrusive cardiac operations;
   performed while the heart is beating, these procedures require surgeons
   and cardiologists to learn new imageguidance based techniques.
   Developing these visual aids and protocols is a challenging task that
   benefits from sophisticated simulators. Existing models lack features
   needed to simulate off-pump valvular procedures: functional, dynamic
   valves, apical and vascular access, and user flexibility for different
   activation patterns such as variable heart rates and rapid pacing. We
   present a left ventricle phantom with these characteristics. The phantom
   can be used to simulate valvular repair and replacement procedures with
   magnetic tracking, augmented reality, fluoroscopy and ultrasound
   guidance. This tool serves as a platform to develop image-guidance and
   image processing techniques required for a range of minimally invasive
   cardiac interventions. The phantom mimics in vivo mitral and aortic
   valve motion, permitting realistic ultrasound images of these components
   to be acquired. It also has a physiological realistic left ventricular
   ejection fraction of 50\%. Given its realistic imaging properties and
   non-biodegradable composition silicone for tissue, water for blood-the
   system promises to reduce the number of animal trials required to
   develop image guidance applications for valvular repair and replacement.
   The phantom has been used in validation studies for both TAVi
   image-guidance techniques', and image-based mitral valve tracking
   algorithms'.}},

Abstract = {{Many strategies have been developed to improve the fouling release (FR)
   performance of silicone coatings. However, biofilms inevitably build on
   these surfaces over time. Previous studies have shown that intentional
   deformation of silicone elastomers can be employed to detach biofouling
   species. In this study, inspired by the methods used in soft-robotic
   systems, controlled deformation of silicone elastomers via pneumatic
   actuation was employed to detach adherent biofilms. Using programmed
   surface deformation, it was possible to release > 90\% of biofilm from
   surfaces in both laboratory and field environments. A higher substratum
   strain was required to remove biofilms accumulated in the field
   environment as compared with laboratory-grown biofilms. Further, the
   study indicated that substratum modulus influences the strain needed to
   de-bond biofilms. Surface deformation-based approaches have potential
   for use in the management of biofouling in a number of technological
   areas, including in niche applications where pneumatic actuation of
   surface deformation is feasible.}},

   molecular contrast from absorptive pigments, such as melanin. It holds
   the potential to be used as a non-invasive screening tool to discern
   whether a given early-stage melanoma has acquired the capacity for
   metastasis. Here, we examined lesions in a Braf(V600E)-driven model of
   melanoma to assess whether loss of the tumor suppressor gene Pten in a
   is accompanied by a shift in pigment expression, as measured in vivo by
   pump-probe microscopy. The data were analyzed to determine differences
   in the excited-state lifetime of melanins expressed in Pten-competent
   and Pten-loss pigmented lesions. Loss of the tumor suppressor Pten was
   found to be accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in
   pixel-average excited state lifetime (p = 1.3e-4).}},

   along with providing defined emission wavelength (s), all in a
   stand-alone modality. Here we design and characterize macromolecular
   nanoassemblies consisting of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), several
   differentially dye-labeled peptides and the enzyme luciferase which
   cumulatively demonstrate many of these capabilities by engaging in
   multiple-sequential energy transfer steps. To create these structures,
   recombinantly-expressed luciferase and the dye-labeled peptides were
   appended with a terminal polyhistidine sequence allowing for controlled
   ratio-metric self-assembly around the QDs via metal-affinity
   coordination. The QDs serve to provide multiple roles in these
   structures including as central assembly platforms or nanoscaffolds
   along with acting as a potent energy harvesting and transfer relay. The
   devices are activated by addition of coelenterazine H substrate which is
   oxidized by luciferase producing light energy which sensitizes the
   central 625 nm emitting QD acceptor by bioluminescence resonance energy
   transfer (BRET). The sensitized QD, in turn, acts as a relay and
   transfers the energy to a first peptide-labeled Alexa Fluor 647 acceptor
   dye displayed on its surface. This dye then transfers energy to a second
   red-shifted peptide-labeled dye acceptor on the QD surface through a
   second concentric Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process.
   Alexa Fluor 700 and Cy5.5 are both tested in the role of this terminal
   FRET acceptor. Photophysical analysis of spectral profiles from the
   resulting sequential BRET-FRET-FRET processes allow us to estimate the
   efficiency of each of the transfer steps. Importantly, the efficiency of
   each step within this energy transfer cascade can be controlled to some
   extent by the number of enzymes/peptides displayed on the QD. Further
   optimization of the energy transfer process(es) along with potential
   applications of such devices are finally discussed.}},

Abstract = {{As a newly developed assay for the detection of endogenous enzyme
   activity at the single-catalytic-event level, Rolling Circle Enhanced
   Enzyme Activity Detection (REEAD) has been used to measure enzyme
   activity in both single human cells and malaria-causing parasites,
   Plasmodium sp. Current REEAD assays rely on organic dye-tagged linear
   DNA probes to report the rolling circle amplification products (RCPs),
   the cost of which may hinder the widespread use of REEAD. Here we show
   that a new class of activatable probes, NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs), can
   simplify the REEAD assays. Easily prepared without any need for
   purification and capable of large fluorescence enhancement upon
   hybridization, NCBs are cost-effective and sensitive. Compared to
   conventional fluorescent probes, NCBs are also more photostable. As
   demonstrated in reporting the human topoisomerases I (hTopI)
   cleavage-ligation reaction, the proposed NCBs suggest a read-out format
   attractive for future REEAD-based diagnostics.}},

Title = {{Enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation via atomic layer
   deposition of TiO2 on fluorine-doped tin oxide nanoparticle films}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{8584-8592}},
Abstract = {{TiO2 is an exemplary semiconductor anode material for
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting electrodes due to its
   functionality, long-term stability in corrosive environments,
   nontoxicity, and low cost. In this study, TiO2 photoanodes with enhanced
   photocurrent density were synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   of TiO2 onto a porous, transparent, and conductive fluorine-doped tin
   oxide nanoparticle (nanoFTO) scaffold fabricated by solution processing.
   The simplicity and disordered nature of the nanoFTO nanostructure
   combined with the ultrathin conformal ALD TiO2 coatings offers
   advantages including decoupling charge carrier diffusion length from
   optical penetration depth, increased photon absorption probability
   through scattering, complimentary photon absorption, and favorable
   interfaces for charge separation and transfer across the various
   junctions. We examine the effects of porosity of the nanoFTO scaffold
   and thickness of the TiO2 coating on PEC performance and achieve an
   optimal photocurrent of 0.7 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under 100 mW
   cm(-2) AM 1.5 G irradiation in a 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.
   Furthermore, the fundamental mechanisms behind the improvements are
   characterized via cyclic voltammetry, incident photon-to-current
   efficiency, transient photocurrent spectroscopy, and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy and are contrasted with those of single crystal
   rutile TiO2 nanowires. The strategies employed in this work highlight
   the opportunities inherent to these types of heteronanostructures, where
   the lessons may be applied to improve the PEC conversion efficiencies of
   other promising semiconductors, such as hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) and other
   materials more sensitive to visible light.}},

Abstract = {{Handheld scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) systems facilitate imaging of young children and
   subjects that have difficulty fixating. More compact and lightweight
   probes allow for better portability and increased comfort for the
   operator of the handheld probe. We describe a very compact, novel SLO
   and OCT handheld probe design. A single 2D microelectromechanical
   systems (MEMS) scanner and a custom optical design using a converging
   beam prior to the scanner permitted significant reduction in the system
   size. Our design utilized a combination of commercial and custom optics
   that were optimized in Zemax to achieve near diffraction-limited
   resolution of 8 mu m over a 7 degrees field of view. The handheld probe
   has a form factor of 7 x 6 x 2.5 cm and a weight of only 94 g, which is
   over an order of magnitude lighter than prior SLO-OCT handheld probes.
   Images were acquired from a normal subject with an incident power on the
   eye under the ANSI limit. With this device, which is the world's
   lightest and smallest SLO-OCT system, we were able to visualize
   parafoveal cone photoreceptors and nerve fiber bundles without the use
   of adaptive optics.}},

Abstract = {{The first generation of intrasurgical optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   systems displayed OCT data onto a separate computer monitor, requiring
   surgeons to look away from the surgical microscope. In order to provide
   real-time OCT feedback without requiring surgeons to look away during
   surgeries, recent prototype research and commercial intrasurgical OCT
   systems have integrated heads-up display (HUD) systems into the surgical
   microscopes to allow the surgeons to access the OCT data and the
   surgical field through the oculars concurrently. However, all current
   intrasurgical OCT systems with a HUD are only capable of imaging through
   one ocular limiting the surgeon's depth perception of OCT volumes.
   Stereoscopy is an effective technology to dramatically increase depth
   perception by presenting an image from slightly different angles to each
   eye. Conventional stereoscopic HUD use a pair of micro displays which
   require bulky optics. Several new approaches for HUDs are reported to
   use only one micro display at the expense of image brightness or
   increased footprint. Therefore, these techniques for HUD are not
   suitable to be integrated into microscopes. We have developed a novel
   stereoscopic HUD which uses spatial multiplexing to project stereo views
   into both oculars simultaneously with only one micro-display and three
   optical elements for our microscope-integrated OCT system. Simultaneous
   stereoscopic views of OCT volumes are computed in real time by
   GPU-enabled OCT system software. We present, to our knowledge, the first
   microscope integrated stereoscopic HUD used for intrasurgical OCT with a
   novel optical design for stereoscopic viewing devices and report on its
   preliminary use in human vitreoretinal surgeries.}},

Abstract = {{Interdisciplinarity is of first importance to evaluate the risks
   associated with nanotechnology. The reasons are that nanomaterials are
   very new materials that combine nano-sizes and new reactivities. The
   complexity comes from the very low concentrations of nanomaterials in
   the environmental medium, the transformations of the nanomaterials due
   to the reactivity of the surface, the transfer in the environmental
   media, particularly in the presence of liquid water (soils, sediments,
   surface water), which implies an association with natural colloids
   (organic or minerals) and blockage in some compartments. These
   properties govern the hazard that strongly depends on exposure and

Abstract = {{Resonant-infrared, matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE)
   has been used to deposit blended, organic thin-films with nanoscale
   domain sizes of constituent polymers, small molecules, or colloidal
   nanoparticles. In the emulsion-based RIR-MAPLE process, the target
   contains a nonpolar, organic solvent phase and a polar, water phase. The
   emulsion properties have a direct impact on the nanoscale morphology of
   single-component organic thin films, while the morphology of blended,
   organic thin films also depends on the RIR-MAPLE deposition mode. In
   addition to these fundamental aspects, applications of blended organic
   films (organic solar cells, anti-reflection coatings, and
   multi-functional surfaces) deposited by emulsion-based RIR-MAPLE are
   presented. Importantly, domain sizes in the blended films are critical
   to thin-film functionality.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{97-107}},
Abstract = {{The resolution of a frequency diverse compressive metamaterial aperture
   imager is investigated. The aperture consists of a parallel plate
   waveguide, in which an array of complementary, resonant metamaterial
   elements is patterned into one of the plates. Microwaves injected into
   the waveguide leak out through the resonant metamaterial elements,
   forming a spatially diverse waveform at the scene. As the frequency is
   scanned, the waveforms change, such that scene information can be
   encoded onto a set of frequency measurements. The compressive nature of
   the metamaterial imager enables image reconstruction from a
   significantly reduced number of measurements. We characterize the
   resolution of this complex aperture by studying the simulated point
   spread function (PSF) computed using different image reconstruction
   techniques. We compare the imaging performance of the system with that
   expected from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) limits.}},

Title = {{Scoping a field experiment: error diagnostics of TRMM precipitation
   radar estimates in complex terrain as a basis for IPHEx2014}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{A diagnostic analysis of the space-time structure of error in
   quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) from the precipitation radar
   (PR) on the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite is
   presented here in preparation for the Integrated Precipitation and
   Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) in 2014. IPHEx is the first NASA
   ground-validation field campaign after the launch of the Global
   Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite. In anticipation of GPM, a
   science-grade high-density raingauge network was deployed at mid to high
   elevations in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA, since 2007. This
   network allows for direct comparison between ground-based measurements
   from raingauges and satellite-based QPE (specifically, PR 2A25 Version 7
   using 5 years of data 2008-2013). Case studies were conducted to
   characterize the vertical profiles of reflectivity and rain rate
   retrievals associated with large discrepancies with respect to ground
   measurements. The spatial and temporal distribution of detection errors
   (false alarm, FA; missed detection, MD) and magnitude errors
   (underestimation, UND; overestimation, OVR) for stratiform and
   convective precipitation are examined in detail toward elucidating the
   physical basis of retrieval error.
   The diagnostic error analysis reveals that detection errors are linked
   to persistent stratiform light rainfall in the southern Appalachians,
   which explains the high occurrence of FAs throughout the year, as well
   as the diurnal MD maximum at midday in the cold season (fall and winter)
   and especially in the inner region. Although UND dominates the error
   budget, underestimation of heavy rainfall conditions accounts for less
   than 20\% of the total, consistent with regional hydrometeorology. The
   2A25 V7 product underestimates low-level orographic enhancement of
   rainfall associated with fog, cap clouds and cloud to cloud
   feeder-seeder interactions over ridges, and overestimates light rainfall
   in the valleys by large amounts, though this behavior is strongly
   conditioned by the coarse spatial resolution (5 km) of the topography
   mask used to remove ground-clutter effects. Precipitation associated
   with small-scale systems (< 25 km(2)) and isolated deep convection tends
   to be underestimated, which we attribute to non-uniform beam-filling
   effects due to spatial averaging of reflectivity at the PR resolution.
   Mixed precipitation events (i.e., cold fronts and snow showers) fall
   into OVR or FA categories, but these are also the types of events for
   which observations from standard ground-based raingauge networks are
   more likely subject to measurement uncertainty, that is raingauge
   underestimation errors due to undercatch and precipitation phase.
   Overall, the space-time structure of the errors shows strong links among
   precipitation, envelope orography, landform (ridge-valley contrasts),
   and a local hydrometeorological regime that is strongly modulated by the
   diurnal cycle, pointing to three major error causes that are
   inter-related: (1) representation of concurrent vertically and
   horizontally varying microphysics; (2) non-uniform beam filling (NUBF)
   effects and ambiguity in the detection of bright band position; and (3)
   spatial resolution and ground-clutter correction.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable, quantitative predictions of the structure of peptides based on
   their amino-acid sequence information are an ongoing challenge. We here
   explore the energy landscapes of two unsolvated 20-residue peptides that
   result from a shift of the position of one amino acid in otherwise the
   same sequence. Our main goal is to assess the performance of current
   state-of-the-art density-functional theory for predicting the structure
   of such large and complex systems, where weak interactions such as
   dispersion or hydrogen bonds play a crucial role. For validation of the
   theoretical results, we employ experimental gas-phase ion mobility-mass
   spectrometry and IR spectroscopy. While unsolvated Ac-Ala(19)-Lys + H+
   will be shown to be a clear helix seeker, the structure space of
   Ac-Lys-Ala(19) + H+ is more complicated. Our first-principles
   structure-screening strategy using the dispersion-corrected PBE
   functional (PBE + vdWTS) identifies six distinctly different structure
   types competing in the low-energy regime (E16 kJ mol(-1)). For these
   structure types, we analyze the influence of the PBE and the hybrid PBE0
   functional coupled with either a pairwise dispersion correction (PBE +
   vdWTS, PBE0 + vdW(TS)) or a many-body dispersion correction (PBE +
   MBD{*}, PBE0 + MBD{*}). We also take harmonic vibrational and rotational
   free energy into account. Including this, the PBE0 + MBD{*} functional
   predicts only one unique conformer to be present at 300 K. We show that
   this scenario is consistent with both experiments.}},

Title = {{Phase transformations in binary colloidal monolayers}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2404-2415}},
Abstract = {{Phase transformations can be difficult to characterize at the
   microscopic level due to the inability to directly observe individual
   atomic motions. Model colloidal systems, by contrast, permit the direct
   observation of individual particle dynamics and of collective
   rearrangements, which allows for real-space characterization of phase
   transitions. Here, we study a quasi-two-dimensional, binary colloidal
   alloy that exhibits liquid-solid and solid-solid phase transitions,
   focusing on the kinetics of a diffusionless transformation between two
   crystal phases. Experiments are conducted on a monolayer of magnetic and
   nonmagnetic spheres suspended in a thin layer of ferrofluid and exposed
   to a tunable magnetic field. A theoretical model of hard spheres with
   point dipoles at their centers is used to guide the choice of
   experimental parameters and characterize the underlying materials
   physics. When the applied field is normal to the fluid layer, a
   checkerboard crystal forms; when the angle between the field and the
   normal is sufficiently large, a striped crystal assembles. As the field
   is slowly tilted away from the normal, we find that the transformation
   pathway between the two phases depends strongly on crystal orientation,
   field strength, and degree of confinement of the monolayer. In some
   cases, the pathway occurs by smooth magnetostrictive shear, while in
   others it involves the sudden formation of martensitic plates.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{2857-2865}},
Abstract = {{Stiffness of trabecular meshwork (TM) may play an important role in
   regulating outflow resistance in healthy and glaucomatous eyes. However,
   the current techniques for stiffness measurement can only be applied to
   TM dissected from human donor or large animal eyes. It is a challenge to
   measure TM stiffness in mouse/rat eyes because of their smaller sizes
   and the delicate nature of TM dissection. To this end, a new technique
   was developed to determine the stiffness of rat TM using atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). In the study, rat eyes were enucleated immediately
   after death and perfused with a tracer (Evans blue) for 40 min. Then,
   the anterior segment was dissected and flat-mounted on a Petri dish with
   TM facing upwards. An AFM probe with a gold-coated colloid tip was used
   to sequentially indent the corneal, TM, and uveoscleral tissues.
   Assuming these tissues to be neo-Hookean materials, the indentation data
   were analyzed with a newly developed mathematical model to calculate the
   apparent initial Young's moduli (E-0)(app). The geometric mean \& SE of
   (E-0)(app) were 162 Pa \& 1.2 (n = 13) for TM and 6189 Pa \& 1.4 (n =
   11) for cornea; and the difference was statistically significant (p <
   0.01). The technique established in this study allows the use of rat eye
   as a potential model for investigation of TM stiffness and its
   influences on outflow resistance. Future studies may also utilize this
   technique to evaluate mechanisms of TM stiffness change caused by aging,
   outflow dysfunction, pathogenesis of glaucoma, and drug treatment.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical aeroelastic stability analysis has been performed on the
   flexible thermal protection system for an inflatable aerodynamic
   decelerator. Structural models consist of one or more truncated conical
   shells of the Donnell type, which may be elastically supported along the
   middle surface. The aerodynamic model is first-order piston theory. The
   Lagrangian of the system is formulated in terms of the generalized
   coordinates for all shell displacements, and the Rayleigh-Ritz method is
   used to derive the equations of motion. The aeroelastic stability
   boundaries and mode shapes are found by calculating the eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors of a large coefficient matrix. When the thermal protection
   system is approximated as a single conical shell, circumferentially
   asymmetric coalescence flutter between the second and third axial modes
   is observed. When many circumferential elastic supports are included,
   the shell flutters symmetrically in zero circumferential waves, with the
   first, second, and third axial modes being the most critical. In this
   case, the flutter boundary, flutter mechanism, and critical modes may
   change significantly with the addition of structural damping.
   Aeroelastic models that consider the thermal protection system as
   multiple interacting shells tend to flutter asymmetrically at high
   dynamic pressures relative to the single shell models, with higher axial
   modes being more critical. It is also found that tension applied at the
   shell edges, orthotropicity, and elastic support stiffness are important
   parameters that can dramatically affect the shell's flutter behavior.}},

Title = {{Two-dimensional spatial manipulation of microparticles in continuous

Abstract = {{We report a modeling and experimental study of techniques to
   acoustically focus particles flowing through a microfluidic channel. Our
   theoretical model differs from prior works in that we solve an
   approximate 2-D wave transmission model that accounts for wave
   propagation in both the solid and fluid phases. Our simulations indicate
   that particles can be effectively focused at driving frequencies as high
   as 10\% off of the resonant condition. This conclusion is supported by
   experiments on the acoustic focusing of particles in nearly square
   microchannels, which are studied for different flow rates, driving
   frequencies and placements of the lead zirconate titanate transducer,
   either underneath the microchannel or underneath a parallel trough. The
   relative acoustic potential energy and the resultant velocity fields for
   particles with positive acoustic contrast coefficients are estimated in
   the 2-D limit. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the spatial
   distribution of the flowing microparticles in three dimensions. Through
   these studies, we show that a single driving frequency from a single
   piezoelectric actuator can induce the 2-D concentration of particles in
   a microchannel with a nearly square cross section, and we correlate
   these behaviors with theoretical predictions. We also show that it is
   possible to control the extent of focusing of the microparticles, and
   that it is possible to decouple the focusing of microparticles in the
   vertical direction from the lateral direction in rectangular channels
   with anisotropic cross sections. This study provides guidelines to
   design and operate microchip-based acoustofluidic devices for precise
   control over the spatial arrangement of microparticles for applications
   such as flow cytometry and cellular sorting. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy among
   men in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer-related
   death. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has gained
   recent popularity to characterize PCa. Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse
   (ARFI) imaging has the potential to aid PCa diagnosis and management by
   using tissue stiffness to evaluate prostate zonal anatomy and lesions.
   MR and B-mode/ARFI in vivo imaging datasets were compared with one
   another and with gross pathology measurements made immediately after
   radical prostatectomy. Images were manually segmented in 3D Slicer to
   delineate the central gland (CG) and prostate capsule, and 3D models
   were rendered to evaluate zonal anatomy dimensions and volumes. Both
   imaging modalities showed good correlation between estimated organ
   volume and gross pathologic weights. Ultrasound and MR total prostate
   volumes were well correlated (R-2 = 0.77), but B-mode images yielded
   prostate volumes that were larger (16.82\% +/- 22.45\%) than MR images,
   due to overestimation of the lateral dimension (18.4\% +/- 13.9\%), with
   less significant differences in the other dimensions (7.4\% +/- 17.6\%,
   anterior-to-posterior, and -10.8\% +/- 13.9\%, apex-to-base). ARFI and
   MR CG volumes were also well correlated (R-2 = 0.85). CG volume
   differences were attributed to ARFI underestimation of the apex-to-base
   axis (-28.8\% +/- 9.4\%) and ARFI overestimation of the lateral
   dimension (21.5\% +/- 14.3\%). B-mode/ARFI imaging yielded prostate
   volumes and dimensions that were well correlated with MR T2-weighted
   image (T2WI) estimates, with biases in the lateral dimension due to poor
   contrast caused by extraprostatic fat. B-mode combined with ARFI imaging
   is a promising low-cost, portable, real-time modality that can
   complement mpMRI for PCa diagnosis, treatment planning, and management.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and high throughput cell sorting is a critical enabling
   technology in molecular and cellular biology, biotechnology, and
   medicine. While conventional methods can provide high efficiency sorting
   in short timescales, advances in microfluidics have enabled the
   realization of miniaturized devices offering similar capabilities that
   exploit a variety of physical principles. We classify these technologies
   as either active or passive. Active systems generally use external
   fields (e.g., acoustic, electric, magnetic, and optical) to impose
   forces to displace cells for sorting, whereas passive systems use
   inertial forces, filters, and adhesion mechanisms to purify cell
   populations. Cell sorting on microchips provides numerous advantages
   over conventional methods by reducing the size of necessary equipment,
   eliminating potentially biohazardous aerosols, and simplifying the
   complex protocols commonly associated with cell sorting. Additionally,
   microchip devices are well suited for parallelization, enabling complete
   lab-on-a-chip devices for cellular isolation, analysis, and experimental
   processing. In this review, we examine the breadth of microfluidic cell
   sorting technologies, while focusing on those that offer the greatest
   potential for translation into clinical and industrial practice and that
   offer multiple, useful functions. We organize these sorting technologies
   by the type of cell preparation required (i.e., fluorescent label-based
   sorting, bead-based sorting, and label-free sorting) as well as by the
   physical principles underlying each sorting mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze long-term fluctuations of rainfall extremes in 268 years of
   daily observations (Padova, Italy, 1725-2006), to our knowledge, the
   longest existing instrumental time series of its kind. We identify
   multidecadal oscillations in extremes estimated by fitting the GEV
   distribution, with approximate periodicities of about 17-21, 30-38,
   49-68, 85-94, and 145-172 years. The amplitudes of these oscillations
   exceed the changes associated with the observed trend in intensity. This
   finding implies that even if climatic trends are absent or negligible,
   rainfall and its extremes exhibit an apparent nonstationarity if
   analyzed over time intervals shorter than the longest periodicity in the
   data (about 170 years for the case analyzed here). These results suggest
   that because long-term periodicities may likely be present elsewhere, in
   the absence of observational time series with length comparable to such
   periodicities (possibly exceeding one century), past observations cannot
   be considered to be representative of future extremes. We also find that
   observed fluctuations in extreme events in Padova are linked to the
   North Atlantic Oscillation: increases in the NAO Index are on average
   associated with an intensification of daily extreme rainfall events.
   This link with the NAO global pattern is highly suggestive of
   implications of general relevance: long-term fluctuations in rainfall
   extremes connected with large-scale oscillating atmospheric patterns are
   likely to be widely present and undermine the very basic idea of using a
   single stationary distribution to infer future extremes from past
   observations.}},

Title = {{River transport of mercury from artisanal and small-scale gold mining

Abstract = {{Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a major contributor to
   deforestation and the largest anthropogenic source of atmospheric
   mercury worldwide. Despite significant information on the direct health
   impacts of mercury to ASGM miners, the impact of mercury contamination
   on downstream communities has not been well characterized, particularly
   in Peru's Madre de Dios region. In this area, ASGM has increased
   significantly since 2000 and has led to substantial political and social
   controversy. This research examined the spatial distribution and
   transport of mercury through the Madre de Dios River with distance from
   ASGM activity. This study also characterized risks for dietary mercury
   exposure to local residents who depend on fish from the river. River
   sediment, suspended solids from the water column, and fish samples were
   collected in 2013 at 62 sites near 17 communities over a 560 km stretch
   of the Madre de Dios River and its major tributaries. In areas
   downstream of known ASGM activity, mercury concentrations in sediment,
   suspended solids, and fish within the Madre de Dios River were elevated
   relative to locations upstream of mining. Fish tissue mercury
   concentrations were observed at levels representing a public health
   threat, with greater than one-third of carnivorous fish exceeding the
   international health standard of 0.5 mg kg(-1). This study demonstrates
   that communities located hundreds of kilometers downstream of ASGM
   activity, including children and indigenous populations who may not be
   involved in mining, are at risk of dietary mercury exposure that exceed
   acceptable body burdens. This report represents the first systematic
   study of the region to aid policy decision-making related to ASGM
   activities in Peru.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional system-oriented dependability metrics like reliability and
   availability do not fully reflect the impact of system failure-repair
   behavior in service-oriented environments. The telecommunication systems
   community prefers to use Defects Per Million (DPM), defined as the
   number of calls dropped out of a million calls due to failures, as a
   user-perceived dependability metric. In this paper, we provide new
   formulation for the computation of the DPM metric for a system
   supporting Voice over IP functionality using the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP). We evaluate different replication schemes that can be
   used at the SIP application server. They include the effects of software
   failure, failure detection, recovery mechanisms, and imperfect coverage
   for recovery mechanisms. We derive closed-form expressions for the DPM
   taking into account the transient behavior of recovery after a failure.
   Our approach and underlying models can be readily extended to other
   types of service-oriented environments.}},

Title = {{Native like helices in a specially designed beta peptide in the gas
   phase}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{5376-5385}},
Abstract = {{In the natural peptides, helices are stabilized by hydrogen bonds that
   point backward along the sequence direction. Until now, there is only
   little evidence for the existence of analogous structures in oligomers
   of conformationally unrestricted beta amino acids. We specifically
   designed the beta peptide Ac-(beta(2)hAla)(6)-LysH(+) to form native
   like helical structures in the gas phase. The design follows the known
   properties of the peptide Ac-Ala(6)-LysH(+) that forms a alpha helix in
   isolation. We perform ion-mobility mass-spectrometry and vibrational
   spectroscopy in the gas phase, combined with state-of-the-art
   density-functional theory simulations of these molecular systems in
   order to characterize their structure. We can show that the
   straightforward exchange of alanine residues for the homologous beta
   amino acids generates a system that is generally capable of adopting
   native like helices with backward oriented H-bonds. By pushing the
   limits of theory and experiments, we show that one cannot assign a
   single preferred structure type due to the densely populated energy
   landscape and present an interpretation of the data that suggests an
   equilibrium of three helical structures.}},

Title = {{Anisotropic vacancy-defect-induced fracture strength loss of graphene}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{13623-13627}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical strength of graphene is much larger than any other
   materials, but is orientation-dependent and can be significantly
   weakened by vacancy defects existing in the lattices. In this work, we
   investigated the orientational anisotropic effect on the fracture
   strength of vacancy-defective graphene using molecular dynamics
   simulations. The results show that the fracture strength of graphene at
   the orientation angle of 15 degrees has the smallest sensitivity to
   vacancy defects due to the minimization of stress concentration in this
   direction. Although the fracture strength of defect-free graphene in the
   zigzag direction is larger than that in the armchair direction, the
   fracture strength in the zigzag direction is much more sensitive to the
   vacancy defects. This study is helpful not only for understanding the
   physical properties of defective graphene but also providing guidance
   for developing graphene-based materials or devices in engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is a rapidly growing technology in the

   classify different tissues. In the steady-state domain a wide spectrum
   of clinical applications is supported with this technology ranging from
   diagnostic to guided interventions. Diffuse reflectance spectra provide
   a wealth of information about tissue composition; however, extracting
   biologically relevant information from the spectra in terms of
   chromophores may be more useful to gain acceptance into the clinical
   community. The chromophores that absorb light in the visible and near
   infrared wavelengths can provide information about tissue composition.
   The key characteristics of these chromophores and their relevance in
   different organs and clinical applications is the focus of this review,
   along with translating their use to the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{Modern ballistic helmets defeat penetrating bullets by energy transfer
   from the projectile to the helmet, producing helmet deformation. This
   deformation may cause severe injuries without completely perforating the
   helmet, termed behind armor blunt trauma (BABT). As helmets become
   lighter, the likelihood of larger helmet backface deformation under
   ballistic impact increases. To characterize the potential for BABT,
   seven postmortem human head/neck specimens wearing a ballistic
   protective helmet were exposed to nonperforating impact, using a 9mm,
   full metal jacket, 124 grain bullet with velocities of 400-460m/s. An
   increasing trend of injury severity was observed, ranging from simple
   linear fractures to combinations of linear and depressed fractures.
   Overall, the ability to identify skull fractures resulting from BABT can
   be used in forensic investigations. Our results demonstrate a high risk
   of skull fracture due to BABT and necessitate the prevention of BABT as
   a design factor in future generations of protective gear.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{We have combined atomic layer lithography and template stripping to
   produce a new class of substrates for surface-enhanced infrared
   absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy. Our structure consists of a buried and
   U-shaped metalinsulatormetal waveguide whose folded vertical arms
   efficiently couple normally incident light. The insulator is formed by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 and precisely defines the gap
   size. The buried nanocavities are protected from contamination by a
   silicon template until ready for use and exposed by template stripping
   on demand. The exposed nanocavity generates strong infrared resonances,
   tightly confines infrared radiation into a gap that is as small as 3 nm
   (lambda/3300), and creates a dense array of millimeter-long hotspots.
   After partial removal of the insulators, the gaps are backfilled with
   benzenethiol molecules, generating distinct Fano resonances due to
   strong coupling with gap plasmons, and a SEIRA enhancement factor of
   10(5) is observed for a 3 nm gap. Because of the wafer-scale
   manufacturability, single-digit-nanometer control of the gap size via
   ALD, and long-term storage enabled by template stripping, our buried
   plasmonic nanocavity substrates will benefit broad applications in
   sensing and spectroscopy.}},

Title = {{Upward electrical discharges observed above Tropical Depression Dorian}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Observation of upward electrical discharges from thunderstorms has been
   sporadically reported in the scientific literature. According to their
   terminal altitudes, they are classified as starters (20-30 km), jets
   (40-50 km) and gigantic jets (70-90 km). They not only have a
   significant impact on the occupied atmospheric volumes but also
   electrically couple different atmospheric regions. However, as they are
   rare and unpredictable, our knowledge of them has been built on
   observations that typically record only one type of such discharges.
   Here we report a close-distance observation of seven upward discharges
   including one starter, two jets and four gigantic jets above Tropical
   Depression Dorian. Our optical and electromagnetic data indicate that
   all events are of negative polarity, suggesting they are initiated in
   the same thundercloud charge region. The data also indicate that the
   lightning-like discharge channel can extend above thunderclouds by about
   30 km, but the discharge does not emit low-frequency electromagnetic
   radiation as normal lightning.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic echoes backscattered from diffuse media, recorded by an array
   transducer and appropriately focused, demonstrate coherence predicted by
   the van Cittert-Zernike theorem. Additive noise signals from off-axis
   scattering, reverberation, phase aberration, and electronic (thermal)
   noise can all superimpose incoherent or partially coherent signals onto
   the recorded echoes, altering the measured coherence. An expression is
   derived to describe the effect of uncorrelated random channel noise in
   terms of the noise-to-signal ratio. Equivalent descriptions are made in
   the aperture dimension to describe uncorrelated magnitude and phase
   apodizations of the array. Binary apodization is specifically described
   as an example of magnitude apodization and adjustments are presented to
   minimize the artifacts caused by finite signal length. The effects of
   additive noise are explored in short-lag spatial coherence imaging, an
   image formation technique that integrates the calculated coherence curve
   of acquired signals up to a small fraction of the array length for each
   lateral and axial location. A derivation of the expected contrast as a
   function of noise-to-signal ratio is provided and validation is
   performed in simulation. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{C.I. Natural Red 4 dye, also known as carmine or cochineal, was adsorbed
   onto the surface of spongin-based fibrous skeleton of Hippospongia
   communis marine demosponge for the first time. The influence of the
   initial concentration of dye, the contact time, and the pH of the
   solution on the adsorption process was investigated. The results
   presented here confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for
   developing a novel dye/biopolymer hybrid material. The kinetics of the
   adsorption of carmine onto a marine sponge were also determined. The
   experimental data correspond directly to a pseudo-second-order model for
   adsorption kinetics (r(2) = 0.979-0.999). The hybrid product was
   subjected to various types of analysis (FT-IR, Raman, C-13 CP/MAS NMR,
   XPS) to investigate the nature of the interactions between the spongin
   (adsorbent) and the dye (the adsorbate). The dominant interactions
   between the dye and spongin were found to be hydrogen bonds and
   electrostatic effects. Combining the dye with a spongin support resulted
   with a novel hybrid material that is potentially attractive for
   bioactive applications and drug delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust unsupervised harmonic co-clustering method
   for profiling arbor morphologies for ensembles of reconstructed brain
   cells (e.g., neurons, microglia) based on quantitative measurements of
   the cellular arbors. Specifically, this method can identify groups and
   sub-groups of cells with similar arbor morphologies, and simultaneously
   identify the hierarchical grouping patterns among the quantitative arbor
   measurements. The robustness of the proposed algorithm derives from use
   of the diffusion distance measure for comparing multivariate data
   points, harmonic analysis theory, and a Haar-like wavelet basis for
   multivariate data smoothing. This algorithm is designed to be
   practically usable, and is embedded into the actively linked
   three-dimensional (3-D) visualization and analytics system in the free
   and open source FARSIGHT image analysis toolkit for interactive
   exploratory population-scale neuroanatomic studies. Studies on synthetic
   datasets demonstrate its superiority in clustering data matrices
   compared to recent hierarchical clustering algorithms. Studies on
   heterogeneous ensembles of real neuronal 3-D reconstructions drawn from
   the NeuroMorpho database show that the proposed method identifies
   meaningful grouping patterns among neurons based on arbor morphology,
   and revealing the underlying morphological differences.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the potential for coexisting responses in a
   harmonically forced buckled beam. It is shown experimentally that such
   structures may present many more responses than might be observed using
   frequency sweep-up and sweep-down testing, with some responses being
   observed only very infrequently. The primary contribution of this work
   is the experimental approximation of the basins of attraction of the
   competing behaviors using stochastic interrogation, which uses strong,
   but random, perturbations to map out the initial conditions that tend to
   each attractor. This procedure is especially difficult in experimental
   studies of distributed systems; hence, we focus on the process of
   stochastic interrogation itself and strictly in an experimental context.}},

Abstract = {{Ocular hypertension in glaucoma develops due to age-related cellular
   dysfunction in the conventional outflow tract, resulting in increased
   resistance to aqueous humor outflow. Two cell types, trabecular meshwork
   (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelia, interact in the
   juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT) region of the conventional outflow tract
   to regulate outflow resistance. Unlike endothelial cells lining the
   systemic vasculature, endothelial cells lining the inner wall of SC
   support a transcellular pressure gradient in the basal to apical
   direction, thus acting to push the cells off their basal lamina. The
   resulting biomechanical strain in SC cells is quite large and is likely
   to be an important determinant of endothelial barrier function, outflow
   resistance and intraocular pressure. This review summarizes recent work
   demonstrating how biomechanical properties of SC cells impact glaucoma.
   SC cells are highly contractile, and such contraction greatly increases
   cell stiffness. Elevated cell stiffness in glaucoma may reduce the
   strain experienced by SC cells, decrease the propensity of SC cells to
   form pores, and thus impair the egress of aqueous humor from the eye.
   Furthermore, SC cells are sensitive to the stiffness of their local
   mechanical microenvironment, altering their own cell stiffness and
   modulating gene expression in response. Significantly, glaucomatous SC
   cells appear to be hyper-responsive to substrate stiffness. Thus,
   evidence suggests that targeting the material properties of SC cells
   will have therapeutic benefits for lowering intraocular pressure in
   glaucoma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of DNA strands available in a biological sample is a major
   limitation for many genomic bioanalyses. To amplify the traces of DNA
   strands, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used for conducting
   subsequent experiments. Compared to conventional instruments and
   analyzers, the execution of PCR on a digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB)
   can achieve short time-to-results, low reagent consumption, rapid
   heating/cooling rates, and high integration of multiple processing
   modules. However, the PCR biochip design methods in the literature are
   oblivious to the inherent randomness and complexity of bioanalyses, and
   they do not consider the interference among the neighboring devices and
   the cost of droplet transportation. We present an integrated design
   solution to optimize the complete PCR procedure, including: 1) DNA
   amplification and termination control; 2) resource placement that
   satisfies proximity constraints; and 3) droplet transportation. Based on
   the sensor feedback data, a statistical model is developed to optimize
   and control the DNA amplification sequence in real-time on a
   cyberphysical biochip. Next, we present a geometric algorithm for
   avoiding device interference and for reducing droplet routing cost. A
   novel optical sensing system is deployed based on the physical
   visibility of droplets. Simulation results for three laboratory
   protocols demonstrate that the proposed design method results in a
   compact layout and produces an execution sequence for efficient control
   of PCR operations on a cyberphysical DMFB.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) stacking of integrated circuits (ICs) using
   through-silicon-vias (TSVs) is a promising integration platform for
   next-generation ICs. Since TSVs are not fully accessible prior to
   bonding, it is difficult to test the combinational logic between scan
   flip-flops and TSVs at a prebond stage. In order to increase
   testability, it has been advocated that wrapper cells (WC) be added at
   both ends of a TSV. However, a drawback of WC is that they incur area
   overhead and lead to higher latency and performance degradation on
   functional paths. Prior work proposed the reuse of scan cells to achieve
   high testability, thereby reducing the number of WC that need to be
   inserted; however, practical timing considerations were overlooked and
   the number of inserted WC was still high. We show that the general
   problem of minimizing the WC is equivalent to the graph-theoretic
   minimum clique-partitioning problem, and is therefore NP-hard. We adopt
   efficient heuristic methods to solve the problem and describe a
   timing-guided and layout-aware solution. We evaluate the heuristic
   methods using an exact solution technique based on integer linear
   programming. We also present design-for-test optimization technique to
   leverage the reuse-based method during post-bond testing. Results are
   presented for 3-D-stack implementations of the ITC'99 and the OpenCore
   benchmark circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Interposer-based 2.5-D integrated circuits (ICs) are seen today as a
   first step toward the eventual industry adoption of 3-D ICs based on
   through-silicon vias (TSVs). The TSVs and the redistribution layer (RDL)
   in the silicon interposer, and micro-bumps in the assembled chip must be
   adequately tested for product qualification. We present an efficient
   interconnect-test solution that targets TSVs, RDL wires, and micro-bumps
   for shorts, opens, and delay faults. The proposed test technique is
   fully compatible with the IEEE 1149.1 Standard. To reduce test cost, we
   also present a test-path design and scheduling technique that minimizes
   a composite cost function based on test time and the design-for-test
   overhead in terms of additional TSVs and micro-bumps needed for test
   access. The locations of the dies on the interposer are taken into
   consideration in order to determine the order of dies in a single test
   path. We present simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   fault detection, and synthesis results to evaluate the hardware cost per
   die relative to the IEEE 1149.1 Standard. We also present test-path
   design and test-scheduling results to highlight the effectiveness of the
   optimization technique.}},

Abstract = {{Commercially-available shear wave imaging systems measure group shear
   wave speed (SWS) and often report stiffness parameters applying purely
   elastic material models. Soft tissues, however, are viscoelastic, and
   higher-order material models are necessary to characterize the
   dispersion associated with broadband shear waves. In this paper, we
   describe a robust, model-based algorithm and use a linear dispersion
   model to perform shear wave dispersion analysis in traditionally
   difficult-to-image subjects. In a cohort of 135 non-alcoholic fatty
   liver disease patients, we compare the performance of group SWS with
   dispersion analysis-derived phase velocity c(200 Hz) and dispersion
   slope dc/df parameters to stage hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Area
   under the ROC curve (AU-ROC) analysis demonstrates correlation between
   all parameters {[}group SWS, c(200 Hz), and, to a lesser extent dc/df]
   and fibrosis stage, whereas no correlation was observed between
   steatosis stage and any of the material parameters. Interestingly,
   optimal AUROC threshold SWS values separating advanced liver fibrosis
   (>= F3) from mild-to-moderate fibrosis (<= F2) were shown to be
   frequency-dependent, and to increase from 1.8 to 3.3 m/s over the 0 to
   400 Hz shear wave frequency range.}},

Title = {{Assessment of the dose reduction potential of a model-based iterative
   reconstruction algorithm using a task-based performance metrology}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{314-323}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Different computed tomography (CT) reconstruction techniques
   offer different image quality attributes of resolution and noise,
   challenging the ability to compare their dose reduction potential
   against each other. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and
   compare the task-based imaging performance of CT systems to enable the
   assessment of the dose performance of a model-based iterative
   reconstruction (MBIR) to that of an adaptive statistical iterative
   reconstruction (ASIR) and a filtered back projection (FBP) technique.
   Methods: The ACR CT phantom (model 464) was imaged across a wide range
   of mA setting on a 64-slice CT scanner (GE Discovery CT750 HD, Waukesha,
   WI). Based on previous work, the resolution was evaluated in terms of a
   task-based modulation transfer function (MTF) using a circular-edge
   technique and images from the contrast inserts located in the ACR
   phantom. Noise performance was assessed in terms of the noise-power
   spectrum (NPS) measured from the uniform section of the phantom. The
   task-based MTF and NPS were combined with a task function to yield a
   task-based estimate of imaging performance, the detectability index
   (d'). The detectability index was computed as a function of dose for two
   imaging tasks corresponding to the detection of a relatively small and a
   relatively large feature (1.5 and 25 mm, respectively). The performance
   of MBIR in terms of the d' was compared with that of ASIR and FBP to
   assess its dose reduction potential.
   Results: Results indicated that MBIR exhibits a variability spatial
   resolution with respect to object contrast and noise while significantly
   reducing image noise. The NPS measurements for MBIR indicated a noise
   texture with a low-pass quality compared to the typical midpass noise
   found in FBP-based CT images. At comparable dose, the d' for MBIR was
   higher than those of FBP and ASIR by at least 61\% and 19\% for the
   small feature and the large feature tasks, respectively. Compared to FBP
   and ASIR, MBIR indicated a 46\%-84\% dose reduction potential, depending
   on task, without compromising the modeled detection performance.
   Conclusions: The presented methodology based on ACR phantom measurements
   extends current possibilities for the assessment of CT image quality
   under the complex resolution and noise characteristics exhibited with
   statistical and iterative reconstruction algorithms. The findings
   further suggest that MBIR can potentially make better use of the
   projections data to reduce CT dose by approximately a factor of 2.
   Alternatively, if the dose held unchanged, it can improve image quality
   by different levels for different tasks. (c) 2015 American Association

Abstract = {{Mobile cloud computing is a new paradigm that uses cloud computing
   resources to overcome the limitations of mobile computing. Due to its
   complexity, dependability and performance studies of mobile clouds may
   require composite modeling techniques, using distinct models for each
   subsystem and combining state-based and non-state-based formalisms. This
   paper uses hierarchical modeling and four different sensitivity analysis
   techniques to determine the parameters that cause the greatest impact on
   the availability of a mobile cloud. The results show that distinct
   approaches provide similar results regarding the sensitivity ranking,
   with specific exceptions. A combined evaluation indicates that system
   availability may be improved effectively by focusing on a reduced set of
   factors that produce large variation on the measure of interest. The
   time needed to replace a fully discharged battery in the mobile device
   is a parameter with high impact on steady-state availability, as well as
   the coverage factor for the failures of some cloud servers. This paper
   also shows that a sensitivity analysis through partial derivatives may
   not capture the real level of impact for some parameters in a discrete
   domain, such as the number of active servers. The analysis through
   percentage differences, or the factorial design of experiments, fulfills
   such a gap. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{627-636}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The phage induced disinfection rates of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 in
   the presence of coliphage Ec2 were determined under a wide range of
   phage and bacterial concentrations. These rates were elucidated to
   determine if phages could be used in water and wastewater treatment
   systems as a biological based disinfectant. Disinfection rates ranging
   from 0.13 +/- 0.1 to 2.03 +/- 0.1 h(-1) were observed for E. coli K12. A
   multiple linear regression model was used to explain the variance in the
   disinfection rates, and this model demonstrated an interaction effect
   between the initial phage and bacterial concentrations. Furthermore, the
   results were modeled with particle aggregation theory, which over
   predicted the disinfection rates at higher phage and bacterial
   concentrations, suggesting additional interactions. Finally, the
   observed and predicted disinfection rates were used to determine
   additional design parameters. The results suggested that a phage based
   disinfection process may be suitable for the inactivation of specific
   pathogens in plug flow reactors, such as the pathogens in hospital
   wastewater effluents and the bacteria responsible for foaming and sludge
   bulking in activated sludge processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The increased use of observations of rainfall microphysics from
   disdrometers to produce more accurate rainfall kinetic energy estimates
   requires closer analysis of measurement uncertainty, and in particular
   how the type of sensor influences rainfall kinetic energy estimates in
   different hydrometeorological regimes. This study evaluates the
   performance of Parsivel(1) (P1) and Parsivel(2) (P2) in measuring
   rainfall DSDs (drop size distributions) in terms of rain depth (P), rain
   rate (I), and kinetic energy (ICE) at three locations in the Southern
   Appalachian Mountains for warm season rainfall. For the same storm
   system, there is large spatial variability of rainfall DSDs between
   ridges and valleys, and between exposed upwind ridges and the inner
   region. Parsivel1 measures underestimate the number of small drops,
   while all rainfall variables are overestimated for DSDs with a large
   number of drops in the midsize range (1-2 mm in diameter) for both P1
   and P2. Overall, results show differences of 40\% in KE estimates when
   P1 is used compared with the more recent P2. The uncertainty analysis
   clearly illustrates the dependence on hydrometeorological regime and the
   instrument proper. Relationships between rainfall KE and intensity (I)
   need to account for the instrumental influence towards better
   characterization of the rainfall erosion potential locally; and regional
   scale studies must include spatially distributed observations to capture
   the dominant hydrometeorological regimes, especially in regions of
   complex topography where the spatial variability of rainfall is very
   high. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{To evaluate the impact of dedicated reader education on
   accuracy/confidence of peripheral zone index cancer and anterior
   prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis with mpMRI; secondary aim was to assess
   the ability of readers to differentiate low-grade cancer (Gleason 6 or
   below) from high-grade cancer (Gleason 7+).
   Five blinded radiology fellows evaluated 31 total prostate mpMRIs in
   this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study for index lesion
   detection, confidence in lesion diagnosis (1-5 scale), and Gleason grade
   (Gleason 6 or lower vs. Gleason 7+). Following a dedicated education
   program, readers reinterpreted cases after a memory extinction period,
   blinded to initial reads. Reference standard was established combining
   whole mount histopathology with mpMRI findings by a board-certified
   radiologist with 5 years of prostate mpMRI experience.
   Index cancer detection: pre-education accuracy 74.2\%; post-education
   accuracy 87.7\% (p = 0.003). Confidence in index lesion diagnosis:
   pre-education 4.22 +/- A 1.04; post-education 3.75 +/- A 1.41 (p =
   0.0004). Anterior PCa detection: pre-education accuracy 54.3\%;
   post-education accuracy 94.3\% (p = 0.001). Confidence in anterior PCa
   diagnosis: pre-education 3.22 +/- A 1.54; post-education 4.29 +/- A 0.83
   (p = 0.0003). Gleason score accuracy: pre-education 54.8\%;
   post-education 73.5\% (p = 0.0005).
   A dedicated reader education program on PCa detection with mpMRI was
   associated with a statistically significant increase in diagnostic
   accuracy of index cancer and anterior cancer detection as well as
   Gleason grade identification as compared to pre-education values. This
   was also associated with a significant increase in reader diagnostic
   confidence. This suggests that substantial interobserver variability in
   mpMRI interpretation can potentially be reduced with a focus on
   education and that this can occur over a fellowship training year.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo accelerate the acquisition of simultaneously high spatial and
   angular resolution diffusion imaging.
   MethodsAccelerated imaging is achieved by recovering the diffusion
   signal at all voxels simultaneously from under-sampled k-q space data
   using a compressed sensing algorithm. The diffusion signal at each voxel
   is modeled as a sparse complex Gaussian mixture model. The joint
   recovery scheme enables incoherent under-sampling of the 5-D k-q space,
   obtained by randomly skipping interleaves of a multishot variable
   density spiral trajectory. This sampling and reconstruction strategy is
   observed to provide considerably improved reconstructions than classical
   k-q under-sampling and reconstruction schemes. The complex model enables
   to account for the noise statistics without compromising the
   computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees. The
   reconstruction framework also incorporates compensation of motion
   induced phase errors that result from the multishot acquisition.
   ResultsReconstructions of the diffusion signal from under-sampled data
   using the proposed method yields accurate results with errors less that
   5\% for different accelerations and b-values. The proposed method is
   also shown to perform better than standard k-q acceleration schemes.
   ConclusionsThe proposed scheme can significantly accelerate the
   acquisition of high spatial and angular resolution diffusion imaging by
   accurately reconstructing crossing fiber architectures from
   under-sampled data. Magn Reson Med 73:126-138, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Introduction: Proteins that undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis are
   subject to lysosomal degradation, requiring radioiodination methods that
   minimize loss of radioactivity from tumor cells after this process
   occurs. To accomplish this, we developed the residualizing
   radioiodination agent N-is an element
   of-(3-{[}{*}I]iodobenzoyl)-Lys(5)-N-alpha-maleimido-Gly(1)-D-GEEEK
   (Mal-D-GEEEK-{[}{*}I]IB), which enhanced tumor uptake but also increased
   kidney activity and necessitates generation of sulfhydryl moieties on
   the protein. The purpose of the current study was to synthesize and
   evaluate a new D-amino acid based agent that might avoid these potential
   problems.
   Methods: N-alpha-(3-iodobenzoyl)-(5-succinimidyloxycarbonyl)-D-EEEG
   (NHS-IB-D-EEEG), which contains 3 D-glutamates to provide negative
   charge and a N-hydroxysuccinimide function to permit conjugation to
   unmodified proteins, and the corresponding tin precursor were produced
   by solid phase peptide synthesis and subsequent conjugation with
   appropriate reagents. Radioiodination of the anti-HER2 antibody
   trastuzumab using NHS-IB-D-EEEG and Mal-D-GEEEK-IB was compared.
   Paired-label internalization assays on BT474 breast carcinoma cells and
   biodistribution studies in athymic mice bearing BT474M1 xenografts were
   performed to evaluate the two radioiodinated D-peptide trastuzumab
   conjugates.
   Results: NHS-{[}I-131]IB-D-EEEG was produced in 53.8\% +/- 13.4\% and
   conjugated to trastuzumab in 39.5\% +/- 7.6\% yield. Paired-label
   internalization assays with trastuzumab-NHS-{[}I-131]IB-D-EEEG and
   trastuzumab-Mal-D-GEEEK-{[}I-125]IB demonstrated similar intracellular
   trapping for both conjugates at 1 h (I-131, 84.4\% 6.1\%; I-125, 88.6\%
   5.2\%) through 24 h (I-131, 60.7\% +/- 6.8\%; I-125, 64.9\% +/- 6.9\%).
   In the biodistribution experiment, tumor uptake peaked at 48 h
   (trastuzumab-NHS-{[}I-131]IB-D-EEEG, 29.8\% +/- 3.6\%ID/g;
   trastuzumab-Mal-D-GEEEK-{[}I-125]IB, 4.53\% +/- 5.3\%ID/g) and was
   significantly higher for I-125 at all time points. in general, normal
   tissue levels were lower for trastuzumab-NHS-{[}I-131]IB-D-EEEG, with
   the differences being greatest in kidneys (I-131, 2.2\% +/- 0.4\%ID/g;
   I-125, 16.9\% +/- 2.8\%ID/g at 144 h).
   Conclusion: NHS-{[}I-131]IB-D-EEEG warrants further evaluation as a
   residualizing radioiodination agent for labeling internalizing
   antibodies/fragments, particularly for applications where excessive
   renal accumulation could be problematic (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-56}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) treats the symptoms of several
   movement disorders, but optimal selection of stimulation parameters
   remains a challenge. The evoked compound action potential (ECAP)
   reflects synchronized neural activation near the DBS lead, and may be
   useful for feedback control and automatic adjustment of stimulation
   parameters in closed-loop DBS systems.
   Objectives: Determine the feasibility of recording ECAPs in the clinical
   setting, understand the neural origin of the ECAP and sources of any
   stimulus artifact, and correlate ECAP characteristics with motor
   symptoms.
   Methods: The ECAP and tremor response were measured simultaneously
   during intraoperative studies of thalamic DBS, conducted in patients who
   were either undergoing surgery for initial lead implantation or
   replacement of their internal pulse generator.
   Results: There was large subject-to-subject variation in stimulus
   artifact amplitude, which model-based analysis suggested may have been
   caused by glial encapsulation of the lead, resulting in imbalances in
   the tissue impedance between the contacts. ECAP recordings obtained from
   both acute and chronically implanted electrodes revealed that specific
   phase characteristics of the signal varied systematically with
   stimulation parameters. Further, a trend was observed in some patients
   between the energy of the initial negative and positive ECAP phases, as
   well as secondary phases, and changes in tremor from baseline. A
   computational model of thalamic DBS indicated that direct
   cerebellothalamic fiber activation dominated the clinically measured
   ECAP, suggesting that excitation of these fibers is critical in DBS
   therapy.
   Conclusions: This work demonstrated that ECAPs can be recorded in the
   clinical setting and may provide a surrogate feedback control signal for
   automatic adjustment of stimulation parameters to reduce tremor
   amplitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   materials. In an effort to investigate the scaling of the nonlinear
   response of the surface plasmon polariton at a metal/dielectric

   metal and the dielectric to the nonlinear response in this specific

   for the gold/dielectric interface, we predict that the dielectric
   nonlinear response is dominant for strongly nonlinear dielectrics such
   as polydiacetylenes, chalcogenide glasses, or even semiconductors. The
   gold nonlinear response is dominant only in cases involving weakly
   nonlinear dielectrics such as silicon dioxide or aluminum oxide. We
   verify the relevance of the metric by investigating the process of
   optical switching via the third-order nonlinear response and discuss
   which gold/dielectric combinations have better switching behaviors. (C)

Abstract = {{A computational model is developed to describe the oxidation of
   nanolaminates comprising Zr/Al bilayers. The model is developed in light
   of recent experimental observations of reactive multilayers ignited in
   air. These suggest that at early stages following the completion of the
   formation reaction, the oxidation process is more closely described
   using a surface-reaction controlled growth regime; however, as the oxide
   layer thickens, transition to the diffusion controlled growth occurs. A
   simplified computational model is consequently developed that
   incorporates both regimes of oxide growth. The evolution of the foil
   temperature is described using an energy balance equation that takes
   into account the oxidation heat, oxygen intake and radiative heat loss.
   The computations are implemented to estimate the oxidation heat release
   rates and the temperature of the oxidizing foil, and to analyze the
   impact of radiative heat losses. The temperature measurements are then
   exploited to characterize the transition from the surface-reaction
   controlled growth regime to the diffusion-limited growth regime. (C)

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing of signals drawn from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
   admits closed-form minimum mean squared error reconstruction from
   incomplete linear measurements. An accurate GMM signal model is usually
   not available a priori, because it is difficult to obtain training
   signals that match the statistics of the signals being sensed. We
   propose to solve that problem by learning the signal model in situ,
   based directly on the compressive measurements of the signals, without
   resorting to other signals to train a model. A key feature of our method
   is that the signals being sensed are treated as random variables and are
   integrated out in the likelihood. We derive a maximum marginal
   likelihood estimator (MMLE) that maximizes the likelihood of the GMM of
   the underlying signals given only their linear compressive measurements.
   We extend the MMLE to a GMM with dominantly low-rank covariance
   matrices, to gain computational speedup. We report extensive
   experimental results on image inpainting, compressive sensing of
   high-speed video, and compressive hyperspectral imaging (the latter two
   based on real compressive cameras). The results demonstrate that the
   proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods by significant
   margins.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its emergence as an efficient platform for point-of-care clinical
   diagnostics, design optimization of digital-microfluidic biochips
   (DMFBs) has received considerable attention in recent years. In
   particular, error recoverability is of key interest in medical
   applications due to the need for system reliability. Errors are likely
   during droplet manipulation due to defects, chip degradation, and the
   lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments. We present an
   illustrative survey on recently proposed techniques for error recovery.
   The parameters of the error-recovery design space are shown and
   evaluated for these schemes. Next, we make use of these evaluations to
   describe how they can guide error recovery in DMFBs. Finally, an
   experimental case study is presented to demonstrate how an
   error-recovery scheme can be applied to real-life biochips.}},

Abstract = {{Hotspots occur frequently in 3D multi-core processors (3D-MCPs) and they
   can adversely impact system reliability and lifetime. Moreover, frequent
   occurrences of hotspots lead to more dynamic voltage and frequency
   scaling (DVFS), resulting in degraded throughput. Therefore, a new
   thermal-constrained task scheduler based on thermal-pattern-aware
   voltage assignment (TPAVA) is proposed in this paper. By analyzing
   temperature profiles of different voltage assignments, TPAVA
   pre-emptively assigns different operating-voltage levels to cores for
   reducing temperature increase in 3D-MCPs. Moreover, the proposed task
   scheduler integrates a vertical-grouping voltage scaling (VGVS) strategy
   that considers thermal correlation in 3D-MCPs. Experimental results show
   that, compared with two previous methods, the proposed task scheduler
   can respectively lower hotspot occurrences by 47.13\% and 53.91\%, and
   improve throughput by 6.50\% and 32.06\%. As a result, TPAVA and VGVS
   are effectively for reducing occurrences of hotspots and optimizing
   throughput for 3D-MCPs under thermal constraints.}},

Abstract = {{The hardware technology characterized by the device parameters (DPs)
   often drives the architectural optimization in a novel computer design
   such as the quantum computer. We highlight the role of DPs by
   quantifying the performance of a fully error-corrected 1024-bit quantum
   carry look-ahead adder on a modular, reconfigurable architecture based
   on trapped ions. We develop a simulation tool that estimates the
   performance and resource requirements for running a quantum circuit on
   various quantum architectures as a function of the underlying DPs. Using
   this tool, we found that (1) the latency of the adder circuit execution
   due to slow entanglement generation process for qubit communication can
   be adequately eliminated with a small increase in entangling qubits, and
   (2) the failure probability of the circuit is ultimately determined by
   the qubit coherence time, which needs to be improved in order to
   reliably execute the adders comprising core of the Shor's algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{For modeling large-scale 3-D problems in electromagnetic and elastic
   waves in the probing of complex media, the finite-difference time domain
   (FDTD) method is widely used. However, there are still challenges in the
   high-frequency regime and extremely low-frequency regime, as well as in
   the accurate curved boundary treatment in this method. In this work, we
   report several new improvements in the FDTD method to address these
   challenging issues: (a) We have developed a high-order FDTD method for
   elastic waves to greatly reduce the numerical dispersion errors, and
   computer memory and CPU time requirements, with a novel treatment of the
   free ground boundary condition and the fluid-solid interface condition.
   (b) We have proposed a new numerical method, finite volume method and
   enlarged cell technique (ECT), to accurately and efficiently implement
   the free-surface boundary conditions in FDTD elastic wave simulations of
   an arbitrary ground-surface topography. (c) We have developed an
   implicit FDTD scheme that allows a time step increment many orders of
   magnitude beyond the stability condition in the explicit FDTD method for
   extremely low frequency electromagnetic probing of subsurface, based on
   the Crank-Nicolson scheme together with the perfectly matched layer. The
   efficacy of these methods and their large scale applications will be
   demonstrated in the presentation.}},

Abstract = {{Digital (droplet-based) microfluidics enables the integration of
   fluid-handling operations and reaction-outcome detection. Despite these
   benefits, defects and erroneous fluidic operations continue to be major

   the first practical and fully integrated cyberphysical error-recovery
   system that can be implemented in real time on a field-programmable gate
   array (FPGA). The hardware-assisted solution is based on an error
   dictionary containing the error-recovery plans for various anticipated
   errors. The dictionary is computed and stored in FPGA memory before the
   start of the biochemical experiment. Errors in droplet operations on the
   digital microfluidic platform are detected using capacitive sensors, the
   test outcome is interpreted by control hardware, and corresponding
   error-recovery plans are triggered in real-time. Experimental results
   are reported for a fabricated silicon device, and links to videos are
   provided for the first-ever experimental demonstration of real-time
   error recovery in cyberphysical digital-microfluidic biochips using a

Abstract = {{Genomic subtype has been shown to be an important predictor of therapy
   response for patients with glioblastomas. Unfortunately, obtaining the
   genomic subtype is an expensive process that is not typically included
   in the standard of care. It is therefore of interest to investigate
   potential surrogates of molecular subtypes that use standard diagnostic
   data such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In this study, we analyze
   the relationship between tumor genomic subtypes, proposed by Verhaak et
   al, 2010, and novel features that capture the shape of abnormalities as
   seen in fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR images. In our
   study, we used data from 54 patients with glioblastomas from four
   institutions provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer
   Imaging Archive (TCIA). We explore five shape features calculated by
   computer algorithms implemented in our laboratory that assess shape both
   in individual slices and in rendered three-dimensional tumor volumes.
   The association between each feature and molecular subtype was assessed
   using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
   We show that the two dimensional measures of edge complexity are
   significant discriminators between mesenchymal and classical tumors.
   These preliminary findings show promise for an imaging-based surrogate
   of molecular subtype and contribute to the understanding of the
   relationship between tumor biology and its radiology phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor characterized
   by very poor survival. However, while some patients survive only a few
   months, some might live for multiple years. Accurate prognosis of
   survival and stratification of patients allows for making more
   personalized treatment decisions and moves treatment of GBM one step
   closer toward the paradigm of precision medicine. While some molecular
   biomarkers are being investigated, medical imaging remains significantly
   underutilized for prognostication in GBM. In this study, we investigated
   whether computer analysis of tumor shape can contribute toward accurate
   prognosis of outcomes. Specifically, we implemented applied computer
   algorithms to extract 5 shape features from magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) for 22 GBM patients. Then, we determined whether each one of the
   features can accurately distinguish between patients with good and poor
   outcomes. We found that that one of the 5 analyzed features showed
   prognostic value of survival. The prognostic feature describes how well
   the 3D tumor shape fills its minimum bounding ellipsoid. Specifically,
   for low values (less or equal than the median) the proportion of
   patients that survived more than a year was 27\% while for high values
   (higher than median) the proportion of patients with survival of more
   than 1 year was 82\%. The difference was statistically significant (p <
   0.05) even though the number of patients analyzed in this pilot study
   was low. We concluded that computerized, 3D analysis of tumor shape in
   MRI may strongly contribute to accurate prognostication and
   stratification of patients for therapy in GBM.}},

   the DES modelling approach is likely best suited for using probabilistic
   distributions to accurately model an operator who is a serial processor

Abstract = {{This paper documents the effect of thermal expansion on a vascularized
   plate that is heated and loaded mechanically. Vascular cooling channels
   embedded in a circular plate provide cooling and mechanical strength.
   The coolant enters the plate from the center and leaves after it cools
   the plate to an allowable temperature limit. The mechanical strength of
   the plate decreases because of the embedded cooling channels. However,
   cooling the plate under an allowable temperature level decreases the
   thermal stresses. The mechanical strength of the plate which is heated
   and loaded mechanically at the same time can be increased by inserting
   cooling channels in it. The mechanical and thermofluid behavior of a
   vascularized plate was simulated numerically. The cooling channel
   configurations that provide the smallest peak temperature and von Mises
   stress are documented. There is one cooling channel configuration that
   is the best for the given set of boundary conditions and constraints;
   however, there is no single configuration that is best for all

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulation provides a powerful and accurate method to
   model protein conformational change, yet timescale limitations often
   prevent direct assessment of the kinetic properties of interest. A large
   number of molecular dynamic steps are necessary for rare events to
   occur, which allow a system to overcome energy barriers and
   conformationally transition from one potential energy minimum to
   another. For many proteins, the energy landscape is further complicated
   by a multitude of potential energy wells, each separated by high
   free-energy barriers and each potentially representative of a
   functionally important protein conformation. To overcome these
   obstacles, accelerated molecular dynamics utilizes a robust bias
   potential function to simulate the transition between different
   potential energy minima. This straightforward approach more efficiently
   samples conformational space in comparison to classical molecular
   dynamics simulation, does not require advanced knowledge of the
   potential energy landscape and converges to the proper canonical
   distribution. Here, we review the theory behind accelerated molecular
   dynamics and discuss the approach in the context of modeling protein
   conformational change. As a practical example, we provide a detailed,
   step-by-step explanation of how to perform an accelerated molecular
   dynamics simulation using a model neurotransmitter transporter embedded
   in a lipid cell membrane. Changes in protein conformation of relevance
   to the substrate transport cycle are then examined using principle
   component analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of enhancing the detection performance of
   detector for target in partially homogeneous background is addressed.
   Based on a general measurement model, a new constant false alarm rate
   (CFAR) adaptive matched detector (AMD) is proposed through a two-step
   design procedure. The detection performance of the AMD is theoretically
   analyzed. Then, the correctness of the analytical results and the
   effectiveness of the AMD are validated through numerical experiments and
   IPIX radar data. To further improve the detection performance of AMD,
   optimal polarimetric waveform design is approached. The waveform is
   designed by optimally selecting the transmitted polarization that
   maximizes a non-central parameter of the detection probability.
   Numerical experiments are provided to validate the performance
   improvement by comparing the optimal AMD with the optimal adaptive
   subspace detector (ASD) and the fixed AMDs. Comparison results show that
   a gain of 1-5 dB is obtained by the optimal AMD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{There has been increasing efforts in enhanced biomedical and geophysical
   imaging in the recent years exploring the magnetic contrast agent. The
   handling of both dielectric and magnetic contrasts adds on difficulties
   to the forward and inverse scattering problems. In this paper, the 3-D
   scattering and the inverse scattering from objects having simultaneous
   electric and magnetic contrasts are presented, where the permittivity,
   conductivity, and permeability of the objects can all be different from
   the background. To cope with the challenging high computation cost in
   the 3-D scattering problem, we formulate the combined field volume
   integral equations and extend the stabilized biconjugate gradient method
   and fast Fourier transform (BCGS-FFT) method to compute the
   electromagnetic field incorporating both the electric and magnetic
   contrasts. The variational Born iterative method for electrical contrast
   inversion in axisymmetric media is generalized to 3-D and to the
   simultaneous reconstruction of objects with electric and magnetic
   contrasts. The BCGS-FFT method provides the predicted scattered field
   from the 3-D heterogeneous objects and the Frechet derivatives in the

Abstract = {{High-resolution numerical weather prediction simulations are able to
   reproduce observed stochastic scale invariant behavior of atmospheric
   wind and water fields down to the effective model resolution, which is
   shown to be a process-dependent transient property that varies with the
   underlying dynamics. The effective resolution gain in dynamical
   downscaling of convective regimes is substantially smaller than the grid
   size decrease indicating that improvements in the model's capacity to
   resolve small-scale processes require consistent adjustments including
   both numerical formulation and physical parameterizations. Instantaneous
   realizations of simulated atmospheric wind and water fields exhibit
   robust multifractal properties with intrinsically transient scaling
   behavior depending on the underlying atmospheric state. In particular, a
   sharp transition in the scaling parameters between nonconvective and
   convective conditions is found, which explains different scaling regimes
   reported in the literature for atmospheric wind, temperature, and
   moisture observations. Spectral slopes around 2-2.3 arise under
   nonconvective or very weak convective conditions, tightly related to the
   scaling behavior of the underlying topography. In convective situations
   the transient scaling exponents remain under 5/3 in agreement with the
   Kolmogorov turbulent regime accounting for the intermittency correction.
   These findings have important implications for stochastic downscaling
   and the implementation of stochastic subgrid scale parameterizations
   using fractal methods. Specifically, it is shown that, based on scaling
   arguments, subgrid scale probability distributions of atmospheric
   moisture can be obtained from the coarse resolution information alone.
   Our results suggest that fractal methods can be used for estimating
   temporally and spatially varying regime-based subgrid scale statistics
   (and realizations of moisture fields) in real time and in a
   computationally efficient manner that could be useful in climate models.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Intradural Stimulation Efficiency and Selectivity in a
   Computational Model of Spinal Cord Stimulation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an alternative or adjunct therapy to
   treat chronic pain, a prevalent and clinically challenging condition.
   Although SCS has substantial clinical success, the therapy is still
   prone to failures, including lead breakage, lead migration, and poor
   pain relief. The goal of this study was to develop a computational model
   of SCS and use the model to compare activation of neural elements during
   intradural and extradural electrode placement. We constructed five
   patient-specific models of SCS. Stimulation thresholds predicted by the
   model were compared to stimulation thresholds measured intraoperatively,
   and we used these models to quantify the efficiency and selectivity of
   intradural and extradural SCS. Intradural placement dramatically
   increased stimulation efficiency and reduced the power required to
   stimulate the dorsal columns by more than 90\%. Intradural placement
   also increased selectivity, allowing activation of a greater proportion
   of dorsal column fibers before spread of activation to dorsal root
   fibers, as well as more selective activation of individual dermatomes at
   different lateral deviations from the midline. Further, the results
   suggest that current electrode designs used for extradural SCS are not
   optimal for intradural SCS, and a novel azimuthal tripolar design
   increased stimulation selectivity, even beyond that achieved with an
   intradural paddle array. Increased stimulation efficiency is expected to
   increase the battery life of implantable pulse generators, increase the
   recharge interval of rechargeable implantable pulse generators, and
   potentially reduce stimulator volume. The greater selectivity of
   intradural stimulation may improve the success rate of SCS by mitigating
   the sensitivity of pain relief to malpositioning of the electrode. The
   outcome of this effort is a better quantitative understanding of how
   intradural electrode placement can potentially increase the selectivity
   and efficiency of SCS, which, in turn, provides predictions that can be
   tested in future clinical studies assessing the potential therapeutic
   benefits of intradural SCS.}},

Abstract = {{A computational model of anaerobic reactions in metallic multilayered
   systems with an equimolar composition of zirconium and aluminum is
   developed. The reduced reaction formalism of M. Salloum and O. M. Knio,
   Combust. Flame 157(2): 288-295 (2010) is adopted. Attention is focused
   on quantifying intermixing rates based on experimental measurements of
   uniform ignition as well as measurements of self-propagating front
   velocities. Estimates of atomic diffusivity are first obtained based on
   a regression analysis. A more elaborate Bayesian inference formalism is
   then applied in order to assess the impact of uncertainties in the
   measurements, potential discrepancies between predictions and
   observations, as well as the sensitivity of predictions to inferred
   parameters. Intermixing rates are correlated in terms of a composite
   Arrhenius law, which exhibits a discontinuity around the Al melting
   temperature. Analysis of the predictions indicates that Arrhenius
   parameters inferred for the low-temperature branch lie within a tight
   range, whereas the parameters of the high-temperature branch are
   characterized by higher uncertainty. The latter is affected by scatter
   in the experimental measurements, and the limited range of bilayers
   where observations are available. For both branches, the predictions
   exhibit higher sensitivity to the activation energy than the
   pre-exponent, whose posteriors are highly correlated. (C) 2014 AIP

Journal = {{MOLECULAR VISION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{1695-1709}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The goal of the present study was to test for the first time
   whether glaucomatous-like disease progression in a mouse can be assessed
   morphologically and functionally with spectral domain optical coherence
   tomography (SD-OCT).
   Methods: We monitored progressive changes in conventional outflow
   tissues of living mice overexpressing human bone morphogenetic protein 2
   (BMP2), a model for glaucoma. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and outflow
   tissue morphology/Young's modulus were followed in mice for 36 days with
   rebound tonometry and SD-OCT, respectively. Results were compared to
   standard histological methods. Outflow facility was calculated from flow
   measurements with direct cannulation of anterior chambers subjected to
   three sequential pressure steps.
   Results: Overexpression of BMP2 significantly elevated IOP in a biphasic
   manner over time compared to mice that overexpressed green fluorescent
   protein in outflow cells and naive controls. SD-OCT revealed changes in
   outflow tissues overexpressing BMP2 that corresponded with the timing of
   the IOP phases and decreased outflow facility. In the first phase, the
   angle was open, but the trabecular meshwork and the cornea were
   thickened. OCT detected increased trabecular meshwork stiffness after
   provocative IOP challenges of the BMP2 eyes, which corresponded to
   increased collagen deposition with transmission electron microscopy. In
   contrast, the angle was closed in the second phase. IOP elevation over
   36 days due to BMP2 overexpression resulted in significant retinal
   ganglion cell and axon loss.
   Conclusions: Although not a feasible open-angle glaucoma model, the BMP2
   mice were useful for demonstrating the utility of SD-OCT in following
   disease progression and differentiating between two forms of ocular
   pathology over time that resulted in ocular hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{When monitoring response to cancer therapy, it is important to
   differentiate changes in glucose tracer uptake caused by altered
   delivery versus a true metabolic shift. Here, we propose an optical
   imaging method to quantify glucose uptake and correct for in vivo
   delivery effects. Glucose uptake was measured using a fluorescent
   D-glucose derivative
   2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-deoxy-D-glucose
   (2-NBDG) in mice implanted with dorsal skin flap window chambers.
   Additionally, vascular oxygenation (SO2) was calculated using only
   endogenous hemoglobin contrast. Results showed that the delivery factor
   proposed for correction, ``R-D{''}, reported on red blood cell velocity
   and injected 2-NBDG dose. Delivery-corrected 2-NBDG uptake
   (2-NBDG(60)/R-D) inversely correlated with blood glucose in normal
   tissue, indicating sensitivity to glucose demand. We further applied our
   method in metastatic 4T1 and nonmetastatic 4T07 murine mammary
   adenocarcinomas. The ratio 2-NBDG(60)/R-D was increased in 4T1 tumors
   relative to 4T07 tumors yet average SO2 was comparable, suggesting a
   shift toward a ``Warburgian{''} (aerobic glycolysis) metabolism in the
   metastatic 4T1 line. In heterogeneous regions of both 4T1 and 4T07,
   2-NBDG(60)/R-D increased slightly but significantly as vascular
   oxygenation decreased, indicative of the Pasteur effect in both tumors.
   These data demonstrate the utility of delivery-corrected 2-NBDG and
   vascular oxygenation imaging for differentiating metabolic phenotypes in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructuring has spurred a revival in the field of direct
   thermoelectric energy conversion. Nanograined materials can now be
   synthesized with higher figures of merit (ZT) than the bulk
   counterparts. This leads to increased conversion efficiencies. Despite
   considerable effort in optimizing the known and discovering the unknown,
   technology still relies upon a few limited solutions. Here ab initio
   modeling of ZT is performed for 75 nanograined compounds-the result of
   accurate distillation with electronic and thermodynamic filtering
   techniques from the 79 057 half-Heusler entries available in the
   AFLOWLIB.org repository. For many of the compounds, the ZTs are markedly
   above those attainable with nanograined IV and III-V semiconductors.
   About 15\% of them may even outperform ZT approximate to 2 at high
   temperatures. This analysis elucidates the origin of the advantageous
   thermoelectric properties found within this broad material class.
   Machine learning techniques are used to unveil simple rules determining
   if a nanograined half-Heusler compound is likely to be a good
   thermoelectric given its chemical composition.}},

Abstract = {{Many details of how thunderstorms generate terrestrial gamma ray flashes
   (TGFs) and other forms of high-energy radiation remain uncertain,
   including the basic question of where they are produced. We exploit the
   association of distinct low-frequency radio emissions with generation of
   terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) to directly measure for the first
   time the TGF source altitude. Analysis of two events reveals source
   altitudes of 11.80.4 km and 11.90.9 km. This places the source region in
   the interior of the thunderstorm between the two main charge layers and
   implies an intrinsic TGF brightness of approximately 10(18) runaway
   electrons. The electric current in this nontraditional lightning process
   is found to be strong enough to drive nonlinear effects in the
   ionosphere, and in one case is comparable to the highest peak current
   lightning processes on the planet.}},

Abstract = {{In the U.S., coal fired power plants produce over 136 million tons of
   coal combustion residuals (CCRs) annually. CCRs are enriched in toxic
   elements, and their leachates can have significant impacts on water
   quality. Here we report the boron and strontium isotopic ratios of
   leaching experiments on CCRs from a variety of coal sources
   (Appalachian, Illinois, and Powder River Basins). CCR leachates had a
   mostly negative delta B-11, ranging from -17.6 to +6.3, and Sr-87/Sr-86
   ranging from 0.70975 to 0.71251. Additionally, we utilized these
   isotopic ratios for tracing CCR contaminants in different environments:
   (1) the 2008 Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) coal ash spill affected
   waters; (2) CCR effluents from power plants in Tennessee and North
   Carolina; (3) lakes and rivers affected by CCR effluents in North
   Carolina; and (4) porewater extracted from sediments in lakes affected
   by CCRs. The boron isotopes measured in these environments had a
   distinctive negative delta B-11 signature relative to background waters.
   In contrast Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in CCRs were not always exclusively
   different from background, limiting their use as a CCR tracer. This
   investigation demonstrates the validity of the combined geochemical and
   isotopic approach as a unique and practical identification method for
   delineating and evaluating the environmental impact of CCRs.}},

Title = {{Single-walled carbon nanotubes increase pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus
   infectivity of lung epithelial cells}},
Journal = {{PARTICLE AND FIBRE TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Airborne exposure to nanomaterials from unintended
   occupational or environmental exposures or as a consequence of product
   use may lead to adverse health effects. Numerous studies have focused on
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their ability to cause
   pulmonary injury related to fibrosis, and cancer; however few studies
   have addressed their impact on infectious agents, particularly viruses
   that are known for causing severe disease. Here we have demonstrated the
   ability of pristine SWCNTs of diverse electronic structure to increase
   the susceptibility of small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) to pandemic
   influenza A H1N1 infection and discerned potential mechanisms of action
   driving this response.
   Methods: Small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were exposed to three
   types of SWCNTs with varying electronic structure (SG65, SG76, CG200)
   followed by infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (pH1N1). Cells were then
   assayed for viral infectivity by immunofluorescence and viral titers. We
   quantified mRNA and protein levels of targets involved in inflammation
   and anti-viral activity (INF beta 1, IL-8, RANTES/CCL5, IFIT2, IFIT3,
   ST3GAL4, ST6GAL1, IL-10), localized sialic acid receptors, and assessed
   mitochondrial function. Hyperspectral imaging analysis was performed to
   map the SWCNTs and virus particles in fixed SAEC preparations. We
   additionally performed characterization analysis to monitor SWCNT
   aggregate size and structure under biological conditions using dynamic
   light scattering (DLS), static light scattering (SLS).
   Results: Based on data from viral titer and immunofluorescence assays,
   we report that pre-treatment of SAEC with SWCNTs significantly enhances
   viral infectivity that is not dependent on SWCNT electronic structure
   and aggregate size within the range of 106 nm - 243 nm. We further
   provide evidence to support that this noted effect on infectivity is not
   likely due to direct interaction of the virus and nanoparticles, but
   rather a combination of suppression of pro-inflammatory (RANTES) and
   anti-viral (IFIT2, IFIT3) gene/protein expression, impaired
   mitochondrial function and modulation of viral receptors by SWCNTs.
   Conclusions: Results of this work reveal the potential for SWCNTs to
   increase susceptibility to viral infections as a mechanism of adverse
   effect. These data highlight the importance of investigating the ability
   of carbon-nanomaterials to modulate the immune system, including impacts
   on anti-viral mechanisms in lung cells, thereby increasing
   susceptibility to infectious agents.}},

Title = {{Vector modifications to eliminate transposase expression following
   piggyBac-mediated transgenesis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Transgene insertion plays an important role in gene therapy and in
   biological studies. Transposon-based systems that integrate transgenes
   by transposase-catalyzed ``cut-and-paste'' mechanism have emerged as an
   attractive system for transgenesis. Hyperactive piggyBac transposon is
   particularly promising due to its ability to integrate large transgenes
   with high efficiency. However, prolonged expression of transposase can
   become a potential source of genotoxic effects due to uncontrolled
   transposition of the integrated transgene from one chromosomal locus to
   another. In this study we propose a vector design to decrease
   post-transposition expression of transposase and to eliminate the cells
   that have residual transposase expression. We design a single plasmid
   construct that combines the transposase and the transpositioning
   transgene element to share a single polyA sequence for termination.
   Consequently, the separation of the transposase element from the polyA
   sequence after transposition leads to its deactivation. We also
   co-express Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) with the
   transposase. Therefore, cells having residual transposase expression can
   be eliminated by the administration of ganciclovir. We demonstrate the
   utility of this combination transposon system by integrating and
   expressing a model therapeutic gene, human coagulation Factor IX, in
   HEK293T cells.}},

Title = {{Cospectral budget of turbulence explains the bulk properties of smooth
   pipe flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Connections between the wall-normal turbulent velocity spectrum E-ww (k)
   at wave number k and the mean velocity profile (MVP) are explored in
   pressure-driven flows confined within smooth walls at moderate to high
   bulk Reynolds numbers (Re). These connections are derived via a
   cospectral budget for the longitudinal (u') and wall-normal (w')
   velocity fluctuations, which include a production term due to mean shear
   interacting with E-ww (k), viscous effects, and a decorrelation between
   u' and w' by pressure-strain effects {[}=pi(k)]. The pi(k) is modeled
   using a conventional Rotta-like return-to-isotropy closure but adjusted
   to include the effects of isotropization of the production term. The
   resulting cospectral budget yields a generalization of a previously
   proposed ``spectral link{''} between the MVP and the spectrum of
   turbulence. The proposed cospectral budget is also shown to reproduce
   the measured MVP across the pipe with changing Re including the MVP
   shapes in the buffer and wake regions. Because of the links between E-ww
   (k) and the MVP, the effects of intermittency corrections to inertial
   subrange scales and the so-called spectral bottleneck reported as k
   approaches viscous dissipation eddy sizes (eta) on the MVP shapes are
   investigated and shown to be of minor importance. Inclusion of a local
   Reynolds number correction to a parameter associated with the spectral
   exponential cutoff as k eta -> 1 appears to be more significant to the
   MVP shape in the buffer region. While the bulk shape of the MVP is
   reasonably reproduced in all regions of the pipe, the solution to the
   cospectral budget systematically underestimates the negative curvature
   of the MVP within the buffer layer.}},

Abstract = {{Self-guiding of an ultraintense laser requires the refractive index to
   build up rapidly to a sufficient value before the main body of the pulse
   passes by. We show that placing a low-intensity precursor in front of
   the main pulse mitigates the diffraction of its leading edge and
   facilitates reaching a self-guided state that remains stable for more
   than 10 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, this precursor slows the phase
   slippage between the trapped electrons and the wakefield and leads to an
   accelerating structure that is more stable, contains more energy, and is
   sustained longer. Examples from three-dimensional particle-in-cell
   simulations show that the conversion efficiency from the laser to the
   self-trapped electrons increases by an order of magnitude when using the

Title = {{The Temporal Spectrum of Adult Mosquito Population Fluctuations:
   Conceptual and Modeling Implications}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{An improved understanding of mosquito population dynamics under natural
   environmental forcing requires adequate field observations spanning the
   full range of temporal scales over which mosquito abundance fluctuates
   in natural conditions. Here we analyze a 9-year daily time series of
   uninterrupted observations of adult mosquito abundance for multiple
   mosquito species in North Carolina to identify characteristic scales of
   temporal variability, the processes generating them, and the
   representativeness of observations at different sampling resolutions. We
   focus in particular on Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura and, using a
   combination of spectral analysis and modeling, we find significant
   population fluctuations with characteristic periodicity between 2 days
   and several years. Population dynamical modelling suggests that the
   observed fast fluctuations scales (2 days-weeks) are importantly
   affected by a varying mosquito activity in response to rapid changes in
   meteorological conditions, a process neglected in most representations
   of mosquito population dynamics. We further suggest that the range of
   time scales over which adult mosquito population variability takes place
   can be divided into three main parts. At small time scales (indicatively
   2 days-1 month) observed population fluctuations are mainly driven by
   behavioral responses to rapid changes in weather conditions. At
   intermediate scales (1 to several month) environmentally-forced
   fluctuations in generation times, mortality rates, and density
   dependence determine the population characteristic response times. At
   longer scales (annual to multi-annual) mosquito populations follow
   seasonal and inter-annual environmental changes. We conclude that
   observations of adult mosquito populations should be based on a
   sub-weekly sampling frequency and that predictive models of mosquito
   abundance must include behavioral dynamics to separate the effects of a
   varying mosquito activity from actual changes in the abundance of the
   underlying population.}},

   approximation for general media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{59-65}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Based on the uniaxial anisotropic perfectly matched layer (UPML) with
   multi-poles, unsplit-field implementation of the higher-order PML using
   the trapezoidal approximation (TA) method is proposed to terminate the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computational domains. From the
   point of view of the Courant-Friedrichs-Levy (CFL) condition, to the
   best of our knowledge, time step based on the TA only needs to meet CFL
   condition, whereas time step based on the matched Z-transform (MZT)
   method has to make it smaller for retaining stability and desirable
   accuracy. Moreover, these formulations are completely independent of the
   material properties of the FDTD domains and hence can be applied to
   truncate arbitrary media without any modification because of the D-B
   constitutive relations used in Maxwell's equations. Four numerical
   examples have been carried out in three dimensional (3D) FDTD
   computational domains to validate these formulations. It is shown that
   the proposed UPML formulations with two poles are effective in terms of
   attenuating both the low-frequency propagating waves and evanescent
   waves and reducing late-time reflections, and also can produce results
   as accurate as the published MZT-UPML but with fewer number of steps and
   less CPU time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digester effluent collected from a swine farm was nitrified in
   lab-scale bioreactors mimicking an innovative manure management system
   to understand factors relevant to a successful start-up. The effects of
   digester effluent strength, aeration time, nitrifying sludge
   inoculation, and initial pH control on the startup of the nitrification
   system were investigated. The results showed that initial NH4+-N
   concentrations higher than 800 mg L-1 could severely inhibit the onset
   of nitrification if relying on native bacterial populations. When
   aeration time was increased from 4 to 12 h d(-1), ammonium oxidation
   occurred earlier, but nitrite oxidation was delayed. However, the delay
   was not observed when bioaugmentation with nitrifying sludge was
   conducted. Initial addition of acid for pH control was unsuccessful as
   initial depletion of alkalinity eventually resulted in self-inhibition
   of nitrification cause by decreasing pH over time. Overall, these
   results provide guidance on how to effectively start large-scale
   innovative animal waste treatment systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We report here the first studies addressing fate and transport of single
   walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in aquatic mesocosms. The experimental
   design was structured to study the impact of nanomaterials within a
   tightly controlled and highly instrumented wetland ecosystems (aka
   mesocosm) and to address questions including fate and transport, effect
   on community structure, effects on biogeochemical function, and effects
   on productivity of the ecosystem. We added well-dispersed CoMoCat SWNTs
   (c(SWNT,0) = 2.5 mg L-1) to the water column of a wetland mesocosm and
   examined the resulting phase distribution over time. Rapid settling of
   SWNTs from the water column was observed within a period of 2 days
   (C-w,(t)/C-w,C-0 < 0.01) after spiking. Samples from all mesocosm
   compartments (e.g. aquatic/semi aquatic plants, biofilm, mosquitofish
   and sediment) were analyzed to evaluate the transport and fate of SWNTs
   in the ecosystem. SWNTs were quantified in organism and sediment
   extracts using near-infrared fluorescence spectroscopy (NIRF). This
   technique can be used to quantitatively detect SWNTs in sediment and
   biotic matrices at environmentally relevant concentrations (MDLwater 5
   mu g L-1 MDLsediment 0.5 mu g g(-1) MDLbiota 5 mu g g(-1) wet weight)
   and qualitatively characterize SWNT samples before and after the
   studies. Results indicated that rapid aggregation and settling of SWNT
   resulted in accumulation of SWNT in surficial sediment. Sediment
   concentrations were spatially variable across the mesocosm, and thus
   estimates of SWNT mass balance within the mesocosm ranged from 7-48\%.
   No bioaccumulation of SWNT in aquatic plants or vertebrates was observed
   over the 10 month incubation. However, NIRF imaging analysis suggested
   that mosquitofish ingested SWNT-laden particles but that burdens of
   SWNTs were confined to gut contents and may have been rapidly
   eliminated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is a paucity of research on posttraumatic ankle
   arthritis (PTAA). We aimed to identify synovial fluid PTAA biomarkers
   using cytokine analysis and metabolic profiling.
   Methods: Ankle joint synovial fluid was obtained from 20 patients with
   PTAA and 20 patients with no ankle pain and no radiographic evidence of
   ankle arthritis (control group). Synovial fluid samples were analyzed
   for IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, MIP-1 beta, MCP-1, IL-1 beta, IL-1Ra, IL-4,
   IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-15 using ELISA and for more than 3000
   metabolites using liquid and gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy.
   To compare presence of cytokines and metabolites between groups, t tests
   were used. Random forest analysis was performed on metabolites to
   determine whether control and PTAA samples could be differentiated based
   on metabolic profile.
   Results: IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-1 were significantly
   elevated in the PTAA group. In addition, 107 metabolites in the PTAA
   group were significantly altered, including derangement in amino acid,
   carbohydrate, lipid, and energy metabolism, extracellular matrix
   turnover, and collagen degradation. Random forest analysis yielded a
   predictive accuracy of 90\% when using the metabolic profiles to
   distinguish between control and PTAA samples.
   Conclusion: This study identified inflammatory cytokines and metabolites
   present in the synovial fluid of PTAA.
   Clinical Relevance: Several of these entities have previously been
   implicated in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis of the knee, but
   many could potentially be used as novel biomarkers of PTAA. Most
   importantly, the findings suggest that metabolites could be used to
   distinguish synovial fluid from patients with PTAA.}},

Title = {{Evaluating iterative reconstruction performance in computed tomography}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Iterative reconstruction (IR) offers notable advantages in
   computed tomography (CT). However, its performance characterization is
   complicated by its potentially nonlinear behavior, impacting performance
   in terms of specific tasks. This study aimed to evaluate the performance
   of IR with both task-specific and task-generic strategies.
   Methods: The performance of IR in CT was mathematically assessed with an
   observer model that predicted the detection accuracy in terms of the
   detectability index (d'). d' was calculated based on the properties of
   the image noise and resolution, the observer, and the detection task.
   The characterizations of image noise and resolution were extended to
   accommodate the nonlinearity of IR. A library of tasks was
   mathematically modeled at a range of sizes (radius 1-4 mm), contrast
   levels (10-100 HU), and edge profiles (sharp and soft). Unique d' values
   were calculated for each task with respect to five radiation exposure
   levels (volume CT dose index, CTDIvol: 3.4-64.8 mGy) and four
   reconstruction algorithms (filtered backprojection reconstruction, FBP;
   iterative reconstruction in imaging space, IRIS; and sinogram affirmed
   iterative reconstruction with strengths of 3 and 5, SAFIRE3 and SAFIRE5;
   all provided by Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). The d' values
   were translated into the areas under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) to represent human observer performance. For
   each task and reconstruction algorithm, a threshold dose was derived as
   the minimum dose required to achieve a threshold AUC of 0.9. A
   task-specific dose reduction potential of IR was calculated as the
   difference between the threshold doses for IR and FBP. A task-generic
   comparison was further made between IR and FBP in terms of the percent
   of all tasks yielding an AUC higher than the threshold.
   Results: IR required less dose than FBP to achieve the threshold AUC. In
   general, SAFIRE5 showed the most significant dose reduction potentials
   (11-54 mGy, 77\%-84\%), followed by SAFIRE3 (7-36 mGy, 50\%-61\%) and
   IRIS (6-26 mGy, 37\%-50\%). The dose reduction potentials highly
   depended on task size and task contrast, with tasks of lower contrasts
   and smaller sizes, i.e., more challenging tasks, indicating higher dose
   reductions. Softer edge profile showed higher dose reduction potentials
   with SAFIRE3 and SAFIRE5, but not with IRIS. The task-generic comparison
   between IR and FBP demonstrated the overall superiority of IR
   performance, as IR allowed a larger percent of tasks to exceed the
   threshold AUC: IRIS, 8\%-12\%; SAFIRE3, 10\%-16\%; and SAFIRE5,
   20\%-33\%. The improvement with IR was generally more pronounced at
   lower dose levels.
   Conclusions: Expanding beyond traditional contrast and noise based
   assessments of IR, we performed both task-specific and task-generic
   evaluations of IR performance. The task-specific evaluation demonstrated
   the dependency of IR's dose reduction potential on task attributes,
   which can be employed to optimize IR for clinical indications with
   specific range of size and contrast. The task-generic evaluation
   demonstrated IR's overall superiority over FBP in terms of the range of
   tasks exceeding a threshold performance level, which can be employed for
   general comparisons between algorithms. (C) 2014 American Association of

Abstract = {{Fabrication of smooth thin films of topological insulators with true
   insulating bulk are extremely important for utilizing their novel
   properties in quantum and spintronic devices. Here, we report the growth
   of crystalline thin films of SmB6, a topological Kondo insulator with
   true insulating bulk, by co-sputtering both SmB6 and B targets. X-ray
   diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy
   indicate films that are polycrystalline with a (001) preferred
   orientation. When cooling down, resistivity rho shows an increase around
   50K and saturation below 10 K, consistent with the opening of the
   hybridization gap and surface dominated transport, respectively. The
   ratio rho(2K)/rho(300K) is only about two, much smaller than that of
   bulk, which indicates a much larger surface-to-bulk ratio. Point contact
   spectroscopy using a superconductor tip on SmB6 films shows both a Kondo
   Fano resonance and Andeev reflection, indicating an insulating Kondo
   lattice with metallic surface states. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of elevation on surface water fluxes in dry alpine grassland
   ecosystems were investigated along an elevational transect between 1000
   and 2000m above sea level established in the Vinschgau/Venosta valley, a
   relatively dry region in the Italian Alps. The GEOtop-dv hydrological
   model was employed in point-scale mode to model the effects of the
   elevation gradient on snow water equivalent (SWE), soil water content
   (), evapotranspiration (ET), aboveground biomass (B-ag) and water use
   efficiency (WUE) in different climatic conditions. Results show that SWE
   decreased strongly with decreasing elevation but was also affected by
   the interannual variability of meteorological drivers. During warmer
   years, the magnitude of changes in SWE was mitigated at higher altitudes
   while exacerbated below 1500m. dynamics indicated that water stress
   conditions for vegetation currently occur at 1000m each year, while only
   a warmer and drier year caused drought at 1500m, and no water stress was
   found at 2000m.ET, B-ag and WUE did not decrease with elevation but
   showed a maximum at an intermediate elevation around 1500m because of
   the contrasting trends of a shorter vegetation season at higher
   elevations and water stress at lower elevations, where, in fact,
   irrigation is needed to maintain grassland productivity. A simulation
   based on long-term climatic conditions in combination with a sensitivity
   analysis of precipitation change showed that this effect is more
   pronounced during drier years, while for the wettest years, ET tended to
   decrease with increasing elevation. Taking these findings together, this
   study suggests that in relatively dry climatic conditions, mountain
   areas generally act as water towers' above 1500m. Quantifying this
   critical threshold and its likely future variation under climate change
   scenarios is a challenge for water resource research in the Alpine
   region and can help stakeholders in planning future mitigation
   strategies. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Pattern synthesis of nonuniform antenna arrays has drawn significant
   attention because of its wide applications. With the aim of reducing the
   number of elements in linear and planar arrays, this paper introduces a
   novel non-iterative method based on the filter diagonalization method
   (FDM), which was originally applied in the problem of identifying and
   quantifying chemical molecules with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in
   quantum mechanical formalism. The proposed method samples the data set
   from the desired discrete pattern and associates the sample data with a
   time autocorrelation function of a fictitious dynamical system, which is
   described by an effective ``Hamiltonian{''} operator that contains the
   array element information. The ``Hamiltonian{''} operator can be
   decomposed by a set of orthonormal eigenvectors. Therefore, the original
   pattern synthesis is converted into solving the general eigenvalue
   decomposition with Krylov bases. The number of nonuniform array elements
   depends on the number of the Krylov bases and the sample data. The
   proposed method can obtain an optimized antenna array to reconstruct the
   desired radiation pattern with a high accuracy. Numerical examples show
   that proposed FDM pattern synthesis can use less prior knowledge to
   achieve the desired pattern with highly sparse antenna arrays.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial coherence properties of the signal backscattered by human
   tissue and measured by an ultrasound transducer array are investigated.
   Fourier acoustics are used to describe the propagation of ultrasound
   through a model of tissue that includes reverberation and random
   scattering in the imaging plane. The theoretical development describes
   how the near-field tissue layer, transducer aperture properties, and
   reflectivity function at the focus reduce the spatial coherence of the
   imaging wave measured at the transducer surface. Simulations are used to
   propagate the acoustic field through a histologically characterized
   sample of the human abdomen and to validate the theoretical predictions.
   In vivo measurements performed with a diagnostic ultrasound scanner
   demonstrate that simulations and theory closely match the measured
   spatial coherence characteristics in the human body across the
   transducer array's entire spatial extent. The theoretical framework and
   simulations are then used to describe the physics of spatial coherence
   imaging, a type of ultrasound imaging that measures coherence properties
   instead of echo brightness. The same echo data from an F/2 transducer
   was used to generate B-mode and short lag spatial coherence images. For
   an anechoic lesion at the focus, the contrast-to-noise ratio is 1.21 for
   conventional B-mode imaging and 1.95 for spatial coherence imaging. It
   is shown that the contrast in spatial coherence imaging depends on the
   properties of the near-field tissue layer and the backscattering
   function in the focal plane.}},

Abstract = {{First-in-Human ARFI Images of RF Ablation Lesions. Background: Visual
   confirmation of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) lesions during clinical
   cardiac ablation procedures could improve procedure efficacy, safety,
   and efficiency. It was previously shown that acoustic radiation force
   impulse (ARFI) imaging can identify RFA lesions in vitro and in vivo in
   an animal model. This is the ``first-in-human{''} feasibility
   demonstration of intracardiac ARFI imaging of RFA lesions in patients
   undergoing catheter ablation for atrial flutter (AFL) or atrial
   fibrillation (AF).
   Methods and Results: Patients scheduled for right atrial (RA) ablation
   for AFL or left atrial (LA) ablation for drug refractory AF were
   eligible for imaging. Diastole-gated intracardiac ARFI images were
   acquired using one of two equipment configurations: (1) a Siemens ACUSON
   S2000 (TM) ultrasound scanner and 8/10Fr AcuNav (TM) ultrasound
   catheter, or (2) a CARTO3 (TM) integrated Siemens SC2000 (TM) and 10Fr
   SoundStar (TM) ultrasound catheter. A total of 11 patients (AFL = 3; AF
   = 8) were imaged. ARFI images were acquired of ablation target regions,
   including the RA cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI), and the LA roof, pulmonary
   vein ostia, posterior wall, posterior mitral valve annulus, and the
   ridge between the pulmonary vein and LA appendage. ARFI images revealed
   increased relative myocardial stiffness at ablation catheter contact
   sites after RFA and at anatomical mapping-tagged RFA treatment sites.
   Conclusions: ARFI images from a pilot group of patients undergoing
   catheter ablation for AFL and AF demonstrate the ability of this
   technique to identify intra-procedure RFA lesion formation. The results
   encourage further refinement of ARFI imaging clinical tools and
   continued investigation in larger clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Correlation between cortical activity and electromyographic (EMG)
   activity of limb muscles has long been a subject of neurophysiological
   studies, especially in terms of corticospinal connectivity. Interest in
   this issue has recently increased due to the development of
   brain-machine interfaces with output signals that mimic muscle force.
   For this study, three monkeys were implanted with multielectrode arrays
   in multiple cortical areas. One monkey performed self-timed touch pad
   presses, whereas the other two executed arm reaching movements. We
   analyzed the dynamic relationship between cortical neuronal activity and
   arm EMGs using a joint cross-correlation (JCC) analysis that evaluated
   trial-by-trial correlation as a function of time intervals within a
   trial. JCCs revealed transient correlations between the EMGs of multiple
   muscles and neural activity in motor, premotor and somatosensory
   cortical areas. Matching results were obtained using spike-triggered
   averages corrected by subtracting trial-shuffled data. Compared with
   spike-triggered averages, JCCs more readily revealed dynamic changes in
   cortico-EMG correlations. JCCs showed that correlation peaks often
   sharpened around movement times and broadened during delay intervals.
   Furthermore, JCC patterns were directionally selective for the
   arm-reaching task. We propose that such highly dynamic, task-dependent
   and distributed relationships between cortical activity and EMGs should
   be taken into consideration for future brain-machine interfaces that
   generate EMG-like signals.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study of a wing-fuselage combination with a rigid-body
   roll degree of freedom for the fuselage and elastic modes for the wing
   is presented along with a companion wind-tunnel test. The full-span wing
   dynamics are modeled using a linear-plate wing structure theory. A
   component modal analysis is used to derive the full structural equations
   of motion for the wing-fuselage combination system. A three-dimensional
   time-domain vortex-lattice aerodynamic model is also used to investigate
   flutter of the linear aeroelastic system. The experimentally observed
   flutter mode is antisymmetric, although theory suggests that the
   symmetric-mode flutter velocity is only modestly higher than that for
   the antisymmetric modes. Correlation between theory and experiment for
   flutter velocity and frequency is good. The experimentally observed
   postflutter response is a limit-cycle oscillation, and this is worthy of
   further study using an appropriate nonlinear theory.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a clinical
   syndrome that is characterized by high pulmonary vascular resistance due
   to changes in lung vascular growth, structure, and tone. PPHN has been
   primarily considered as a disease of the small pulmonary arteries (PA),
   but proximal vascular stiffness has been shown to be an important
   predictor of morbidity and mortality in other diseases associated with
   pulmonary hypertension (PH). The objective of this study is to
   characterize main PA (MPA) stiffness in experimental PPHN and to
   determine the relationship of altered biomechanics of the MPA with
   changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) content and orientation of
   collagen and elastin fibers. MPAs were isolated from control and PPHN
   fetal sheep model and were tested by planar biaxial testing to measure
   stiffness in circumferential and axial vessel orientations. Test
   specimens were fixed for histological assessments of the vascular wall
   ECM constituents collagen and elastin. MPAs from PPHN sheep had
   increased mechanical stiffness (P < 0.05) and altered ECM remodeling
   compared with control MPA. A constitutive mathematical model and
   histology demonstrated that PPHN vessels have a smaller contribution of
   elastin and a greater role for collagen fiber engagement compared with
   the control arteries. We conclude that exposure to chronic hemodynamic
   stress in late-gestation fetal sheep increases proximal PA stiffness and
   alters ECM remodeling. We speculate that proximal PA stiffness further
   contributes to increased right ventricular impedance in experimental
   PPHN, which contributes to abnormal transition of the pulmonary
   circulation at birth.}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Incorporating high-frequency components in transcutaneous
   electrical stimulation (TES) waveforms may make it possible to stimulate
   deeper nerve fibers since the impedance of tissue declines with
   increasing frequency. However, the mechanisms of high-frequency TES
   remain largely unexplored. We investigated the properties of TES with
   frequencies beyond those typically used in neural stimulation. Approach.
   We implemented a multilayer volume conductor model including dispersion
   and capacitive effects, coupled to a cable model of a nerve fiber. We
   simulated voltage-and current-controlled transcutaneous stimulation, and
   quantified the effects of frequency on the distribution of potentials
   and fiber excitation. We also quantified the effects of a novel
   transdermal amplitude modulated signal (TAMS) consisting of a non-zero
   offset sinusoidal carrier modulated by a square-pulse train. Main
   results. The model revealed that high-frequency signals generated larger
   potentials at depth than did low frequencies, but this did not translate
   into lower stimulation thresholds. Both TAMS and conventional
   rectangular pulses activated more superficial fibers in addition to the
   deeper, target fibers, and at no frequency did we observe an inversion
   of the strength-distance relationship. Current regulated stimulation was
   more strongly influenced by fiber depth, whereas voltage regulated
   stimulation was more strongly influenced by skin thickness. Finally, our
   model reproduced the threshold-frequency relationship of experimentally
   measured motor thresholds. Significance. The model may be used for
   prediction of motor thresholds in TES, and contributes to the
   understanding of high-frequency TES.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the noise properties of supercontinuum light sources when
   used in low-coherence interferometry applications. The first application
   is a multiple-scattering low-coherence interferometry (ms2/LCI) system,
   where high power and long image acquisition times are required to image
   deep into tissue. For this system, we compare the noise characteristics
   of two supercontinuum sources from different suppliers. Both sources
   have long-term drift that limits the amount of time over which signal
   averaging is advantageous for reducing noise. The second application is
   a high-resolution optical coherence tomography system, where broadband
   light is needed for high axial resolution. For this system, we compare
   the noise performance of the two supercontinuum sources and a light
   source based on four superluminescent diodes (SLD) using imaging
   contrast as a comparative metric. We find that the NKT SuperK has
   superior noise performance compared with the Fianium SC-450-4, but

Abstract = {{The folding behaviors and mechanisms of large multidomain proteins have
   remained largely uncharacterized, primarily because of the lack of
   appropriate research methods. To address these limitations, novel
   mechanical folding probes have been developed that are based on
   antiparallel coiled-coil polypeptides. Such probes can be conveniently
   inserted at the DNA level, at different positions within the protein of
   interest where they minimally disturb the host protein structure. During
   single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements, the forced unfolding of
   the probe captures the progress of the unfolding front through the host
   protein structure. This novel approach allows unfolding pathways of
   large proteins to be directly identified. As an example, this probe was
   used in a large multidomain protein with ten identical ankyrin repeats,
   and the unfolding pathway, its direction, and the order of sequential
   unfolding were unequivocally and precisely determined. This development
   facilitates the examination of the folding pathways of large proteins,
   which are predominant in the proteasomes of all organisms, but have thus
   far eluded study because of the technical limitations encountered when
   using traditional techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which were
   first introduced as LDPC convolutional codes, have been shown to exhibit
   excellent performance under low-complexity belief-propagation decoding.
   This phenomenon is now termed threshold saturation via spatial coupling.
   Spatially-coupled codes have been successfully applied in numerous
   areas. In particular, it was proven that spatially-coupled regular LDPC
   codes universally achieve capacity over the class of binary memoryless
   symmetric (BMS) channels under belief-propagation decoding. Recently,
   potential functions have been used to simplify threshold saturation
   proofs for scalar and vector recursions. In this paper, potential
   functions are used to prove threshold saturation for irregular LDPC and
   low-density generator-matrix codes on BMS channels, extending the
   simplified proof technique to BMS channels. The corresponding potential
   functions are closely related to the average Bethe free entropy of the
   ensembles in the large-system limit. These functions also appear in
   statistical physics when the replica method is used to analyze optimal
   decoding.}},

Abstract = {{IEEE 1609.4 protocol defines a channel switching mechanism to enable a
   single radio operating efficiently on multiple channels to support both
   safety and non-safety services. Basic safety message (BSM) is
   transmitted only through the control channel at regular intervals. In
   this paper, we propose an analytic model based on interacting
   semi-Markov process (SMP) to evaluate both Medium Access Control (MAC)
   and application level performance and reliability of safety message
   broadcasting incorporating the impact of multi-channel operations.
   Message service time distribution is derived using Laplace-Stieltjes
   transform based on the proposed model. Due to the cyclic interactions
   between the SMP models for vehicles contending the same channel,
   fixed-point iteration is used to obtain converged solutions.
   Subsequently, MAC and application-level performance and reliability
   metrics are derived based on the converged solutions. Channel fading
   with path loss is taken into consideration in this derivation. The
   analytic models are validated through extensive simulations in NS2 to
   verify the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed fixed-point
   iteration based model decomposition. The effects of channel switching
   mechanism and channel fading are also evaluated by comparing with other
   analytic models.}},

Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{6105-6117}},

Abstract = {{We consider the scenario of a multi-cluster network, in which each
   cluster contains multiple single-antenna source destination pairs that
   communicate simultaneously over the same channel. The communications are
   supported by cooperating amplify-and-forward relays, which perform
   beamforming. While the communications take place within the cluster,
   there is inter-cluster as well as intra-cluster interference. The
   beamforming weights are obtained so that the total relay transmit power
   is minimized, while a certain signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
   (SINR) at the destinations is met. First, we show that a computationally
   efficient approximate solution is attainable by relaxing the original
   NP-hard nonconvex problem to a semidefinite optimization form. Then, we
   propose a decentralized method to solve the relaxed problem, based on
   the recently developed Accelerated Distributed Augmented Lagrangians
   (ADAL) algorithm, a distributed optimization technique that achieves
   fast convergence rates. Our decentralized solution allows for each
   cluster to compute its own beamforming weights, while coordinating with
   other clusters via appropriate message exchanges. Two different
   approaches are presented, differing in the message exchange patterns
   between clusters. The performance of the decentralized scheme is
   demonstrated via simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of pulmonary pathologies, in particular interstitial lung
   diseases, are characterized by thickening of the pulmonary blood-gas
   barrier, and this thickening results in reduced gas exchange. Such
   diffusive impairment is challenging to quantify spatially, because the
   distributions of the metabolically relevant gases (CO2 and O-2) cannot
   be detected directly within the lungs. Hyperpolarized (HP) Xe-129 is a
   promising surrogate for these metabolic gases, because MR spectroscopy
   and imaging allow gaseous alveolar Xe-129 to be detected separately from
   Xe-129 dissolved in the red blood cells (RBCs) and the adjacent tissues,
   which comprise blood plasma and lung interstitium. Because Xe-129
   reaches the RBCs by diffusing across the same barrier tissues (blood
   plasma and interstitium) as O-2, barrier thickening will delay Xe-129
   transit and, thus, reduce RBC-specific Xe-129 MR signal. Here we have
   exploited these properties to generate 3D, MR images of Xe-129 uptake by
   the RBCs in two groups of rats. In the experimental group, unilateral
   fibrotic injury was generated prior to imaging by instilling bleomycin
   into one lung. In the control group, a unilateral sham instillation of
   saline was performed. Uptake of Xe-129 by the RBCs, quantified as the
   fraction of RBC signal relative to total dissolved Xe-129 signal, was
   significantly reduced (P=0.03) in the injured lungs of bleomycin-treated
   animals. In contrast, no significant difference (P=0.56) was observed
   between the saline-treated and untreated lungs of control animals.
   Together, these results indicate that 3D MRI of HP Xe-129 dissolved in
   the pulmonary tissues can provide useful biomarkers of impaired
   diffusive gas exchange resulting from fibrotic thickening. Copyright (c)

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1530-1541}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Clinical deployment of hyperpolarized Xe-129
   magnetic resonance imaging requires accurate quantification and
   visualization of the ventilation defect percentage (VDP). Here, we
   improve the robustness of our previous semiautomated analysis-method to
   reduce operator dependence, correct for B-1 inhomogeneity and vascular
   structures, and extend the analysis to display multiple intensity
   clusters.
   Materials and Methods: Two segmentation methods were compared-a seeded
   region-growing method, previously validated by expert reader scoring,
   and a new linear-binning method that corrects the effects of bias field
   and vascular structures. The new method removes nearly all operator
   interventions by rescaling the Xe-129 magnetic resonance images to the
   99th percentile of the cumulative distribution and applying fixed
   thresholds to classify Xe-129 voxels into four clusters: defect, low,
   medium, and high intensity. The methods were applied to 24 subjects
   including patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8),
   age-matched controls (n = 8), and healthy normal subjects (n = 8).
   Results: Linear-binning enabled a faster and more reproducible workflow
   and permitted analysis of an additional 0.25 +/- 0.18 L of lung volume
   by accounting for vasculature. Like region-growing, linear-binning VDP
   correlated strongly with reader scoring (R-2 = 0.93, P < .0001), but
   with less systematic bias. Moreover, linear-binning maps clearly depict
   regions of low and high intensity that may prove useful for phenotyping
   subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
   Conclusions: Corrected linear-binning provides a robust means to
   quantify Xe-129 ventilation images yielding VDP values that are
   indistinguishable from expert reader scores, while exploiting the entire
   dynamic range to depict multiple image clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Cells isolated from intervertebral disc (IVD) tissues of human surgical
   samples are one of potential sources for the IVD cellular therapy. The
   purpose of this study was to develop a new non-enzymatic method,
   ``tissue incubation{''}, for isolating human IVD cells. The IVD tissues
   of annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) were incubated
   separately in tissue culture flasks with culture medium. After 7-10 days
   incubation, cells were able to migrate out of IVD tissues and
   proliferate in vitro. After 3-4 weeks culture, expanded cells were
   harvested by trypsinization, and the remaining tissues were transferred
   to a new flask for another round of incubation. The molecular phenotype
   of IVD cells from juvenile and adult human samples was evaluated by both
   flow cytometry analysis and immunocytochemical staining for the
   expression of protein markers of NP cells (CD24, CD54, CD239, integrin
   alpha 6 and laminin alpha 5). Flow cytometry confirmed that both AF and
   NP cells of all ages positively expressed CD54 and integrin alpha 6,
   with higher expression levels in NP cells than in AF cells for the
   juvenile group sample. However, CD24 expression was only found in
   juvenile NP cells, and not in AF or older disc cells. Similar expression
   patterns for NP markers were also confirmed by immunocytochemistry. In
   summary, this new non-enzymatic tissue incubation method for cell
   isolation preserves molecular phenotypic markers of NP cells and may
   provide a valuable cell source for the study of NP regeneration
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue and biomaterial microenvironments provide architectural cues that
   direct important cell behaviors including cell shape, alignment,
   migration, and resulting tissue formation. These architectural features
   may be presented to cells across multiple length scales, from nanometers
   to millimeters in size. In this study, we examined how architectural
   cues at two distinctly different length scales, ``micro-scale{''} cues
   on the order of similar to 1-2 mu m, and ``meso-scale{''} cues several
   orders of magnitude larger (>100 mu m), interact to direct aligned
   neo-tissue formation. Utilizing a micro-photopatterning (mu PP) model
   system to precisely arrange cell-adhesive patterns, we examined the
   effects of substrate architecture at these length scales on human
   mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) organization, gene expression, and
   fibrillar collagen deposition. Both micro- and meso-scale architectures
   directed cell alignment and resulting tissue organization, and when
   combined, meso cues could enhance or compete against micro-scale cues.
   As meso boundary aspect ratios were increased, meso-scale cues overrode
   micro-scale cues and controlled tissue alignment, with a characteristic
   critical width (similar to 500 mu m) similar to boundary dimensions that
   exist in vivo in highly aligned tissues. Meso-scale cues acted via both
   lateral confinement (in a cell-density-dependent manner) and by
   permitting end-to-end cell arrangements that yielded greater fibrillar
   collagen deposition. Despite large differences in fibrillar collagen
   content and organization between mu PP architectural conditions, these
   changes did not correspond with changes in gene expression of key matrix
   or tendon-related genes. These findings highlight the complex interplay
   between geometric cues at multiple length scales and may have
   implications for tissue engineering strategies, where scaffold designs
   that incorporate cues at multiple length scales could improve neo-tissue
   organization and resulting functional outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We develop a Bayesian nonparametric model for reconstructing magnetic
   resonance images (MRIs) from highly undersampled k-space data. We
   perform dictionary learning as part of the image reconstruction process.
   To this end, we use the beta process as a nonparametric dictionary
   learning prior for representing an image patch as a sparse combination
   of dictionary elements. The size of the dictionary and patch-specific
   sparsity pattern are inferred from the data, in addition to other
   dictionary learning variables. Dictionary learning is performed directly
   on the compressed image, and so is tailored to the MRI being considered.
   In addition, we investigate a total variation penalty term in
   combination with the dictionary learning model, and show how the
   denoising property of dictionary learning removes dependence on
   regularization parameters in the noisy setting. We derive a stochastic
   optimization algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo for the
   Bayesian model, and use the alternating direction method of multipliers
   for efficiently performing total variation minimization. We present
   empirical results on several MRI, which show that the proposed
   regularization framework can improve reconstruction accuracy over other
   methods.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{291-299}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the complete thermofluid design and
   performance of a thermoelectric module. We increase the temperature
   difference that must be maintained across the module, and at the same
   time we reduce the pumping power required by the streams that bathe the
   hot and cold plates of the module. We find that for greater power output
   the two streams must be configured in parallel, not in counterflow, and
   not between two well mixed plenums. We also find that the loss of
   thermoelectric power due to the temperature nonuniformity of the two
   plates competes with the power lost during the pumping of the two
   streams, and that from this competition results the optimal mass flow
   rates of the two streams. At the optimum, the maximized power output of
   the module is proportional to a group of geometric parameters (Eq.
   (39)), which can be maximized further by designing vascular flow
   architectures for the two plates. The vascular designs reveal an optimal
   ratio of channel diameters, optimal plate aspect ratio, and a channel
   flow volume fraction that is of the same order as the ratio of the fluid
   thermal conductivity divided by the solid thermal conductivity. The flow
   architectures are further illustrated with numerical examples of
   vascular and serpentine configuration and performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The erroneous and unpredictable behavior of percutaneous glucose sensors
   just days following implantation has limited their clinical utility for
   diabetes management. Recent research has implicated the presence of
   adherent inflammatory cells as the key mitigating factor limiting sensor
   functionality in this period of days post-implantation. Here we present
   a novel in vitro platform to mimic the cell-embedded provisional matrix
   that forms adjacent to the sensor immediately after implantation for the
   focused investigation of the effects of early stage tissue response on
   sensor function. This biomimetic surrogate is formed by imbibing
   fibrin-based gels with physiological densities of inflammatory RAW 264.7
   macrophages. When surrounding functional sensors, macrophage-embedded
   fibrin gels contribute to sensor signal declines that are similar in
   both shape and magnitude to those observed in previous whole blood and
   small animal studies. Signal decline in the presence of gels is both
   metabolically-mediated and sensitive to cell type and activation.
   Computational modeling of the experimental setup is also presented to
   validate the design by showing that the cellular glucose uptake
   parameters necessary to achieve such experimental declines align well
   with literature values. Together, these data suggest this in vitro
   provisional matrix surrogate may serve as an effective screening tool
   for testing the biocompatibility of future glucose sensor designs. (C)

Title = {{The PSTD Method with the 4th-Order Time Integration for 3D TAT
   Reconstruction of a Breast Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The thermoacoustic tomography (TAT) is a novel noninvasive and
   nonionizing medical imaging modality for breast cancer detection. In the
   TAT, a short pulse of microwave is irradiated to the breast tissue. The
   tissue absorbs the microwave energy and is heated up momentarily, thus
   it generates acoustic waves due to the thermoelastic expansion. If the
   pulse width of the microwave radiation is around one microsecond, the
   generated acoustic waves are ultrasonic and are in the MHz range.
   Wide-band ultrasonic transducers are employed to acquire the
   time-resolved ultrasound signals, which carry information about the
   microwave absorption properties (mainly related to conductivities) of
   different tissues. An image showing such properties can then be
   reconstructed from the time-resolved ultrasound signals.
   Most existing TAT reconstruction methods are based on the assumption
   that the tissue under study is acoustically homogeneous. In practice,
   however, most biological tissues are inhomogeneous. For example, the
   speed of sound has about 10\% variation in breast tissue. The acoustic
   heterogeneity will cause phase distortion of the pressure field, which
   will in turn cause blurring in the reconstructed image, thus limiting
   the ability to resolve small objects. In this work, a 3D inhomogeneous
   reconstruction method based on pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD) is
   presented to overcome this problem. The method includes two steps. The
   first step is a homogeneous reconstruction process, from which an
   initial image is obtained. Since the inhomogeneity itself is usually an
   acoustic source, the shape and location of the inhomogeneity can be
   estimated. Then, the acoustic properties of the inhomogeneities
   (available from the literatures for known tissue types) are assigned to
   the classified regions, and the other reconstruction based on the
   updated acoustic property map is conducted. With this process, the phase
   distortion can be effectively corrected. So it can improve the ability
   to image small objects.
   A 3D breast phantom is used to study the proposed method. The breast
   phantom was generated based on the data set of the Visible Human
   Project. Regions of different tissue types have been classified and
   acoustic and electric properties are assigned to such regions. Small
   phantom tumors placed in the breast phantom have been reconstructed
   successfully with the inhomogeneous reconstruction method. Improved
   resolution has been achieved compared to that obtained by homogeneous
   method.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the development of an easily deployable LF near-field
   interferometric-time of arrival (TOA) 3-D Lightning Mapping Array
   applied to imaging of entire lightning flashes. An interferometric
   cross-correlation technique is applied in our system to compute windowed
   two-sensor time differences with submicrosecond time resolution before
   TOA is used for source location. Compared to previously reported LF
   lightning location systems, our system captures many more LF sources.
   This is due mainly to the improved mapping of continuous lightning
   processes by using this type of hybrid interferometry/TOA processing
   method. We show with five station measurements that the array detects
   and maps different lightning processes, such as stepped and dart
   leaders, during both in-cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes. Lightning
   images mapped by our LF system are remarkably similar to those created
   by VHF mapping systems, which may suggest some special links between LF
   and VHF emission during lightning processes.}},

Title = {{An integrated transcriptome and expressed variant analysis of sepsis
   survival and death}},
Journal = {{GENOME MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sepsis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is not a
   homogeneous disease but rather a syndrome encompassing many
   heterogeneous pathophysiologies. Patient factors including genetics
   predispose to poor outcomes, though current clinical characterizations
   fail to identify those at greatest risk of progression and mortality.
   Methods: The Community Acquired Pneumonia and Sepsis Outcome Diagnostic
   study enrolled 1,152 subjects with suspected sepsis. We sequenced
   peripheral blood RNA of 129 representative subjects with systemic
   inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis (SIRS due to infection),
   including 78 sepsis survivors and 28 sepsis non-survivors who had
   previously undergone plasma proteomic and metabolomic profiling. Gene
   expression differences were identified between sepsis survivors, sepsis
   non-survivors, and SIRS followed by gene enrichment pathway analysis.
   Expressed sequence variants were identified followed by testing for
   association with sepsis outcomes.
   Results: The expression of 338 genes differed between subjects with SIRS
   and those with sepsis, primarily reflecting immune activation in sepsis.
   Expression of 1,238 genes differed with sepsis outcome: non-survivors
   had lower expression of many immune function-related genes. Functional
   genetic variants associated with sepsis mortality were sought based on a
   common disease-rare variant hypothesis. VPS9D1, whose expression was
   increased in sepsis survivors, had a higher burden of missense variants
   in sepsis survivors. The presence of variants was associated with
   altered expression of 3,799 genes, primarily reflecting Golgi and
   endosome biology.
   Conclusions: The activation of immune response-related genes seen in
   sepsis survivors was muted in sepsis non-survivors. The association of
   sepsis survival with a robust immune response and the presence of
   missense variants in VPS9D1 warrants replication and further functional
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Diarthrodial joints are essential for load bearing and locomotion.
   Physiologically, articular cartilage sustains millions of cycles of
   mechanical loading. Chondrocytes, the cells in cartilage, regulate their
   metabolic activities in response to mechanical loading. Pathological
   mechanical stress can lead to maladaptive cellular responses and
   subsequent cartilage degeneration. We sought to deconstruct chondrocyte
   mechanotransduction by identifying mechanosensitive ion channels
   functioning at injurious levels of strain. We detected robust expression
   of the recently identified mechanosensitive channels, PIEZO1 and PIEZO2.
   Combined directed expression of Piezo1 and -2 sustained potentiated
   mechanically induced Ca2+ signals and electrical currents compared with
   single-Piezo expression. In primary articular chondrocytes, mechanically
   evoked Ca2+ transients produced by atomic force microscopy were
   inhibited by GsMTx4, a PIEZO-blocking peptide, and by Piezo1- or
   Piezo2-specific siRNA. We complemented the cellular approach with an
   explant-cartilage injury model. GsMTx4 reduced chondrocyte death after
   mechanical injury, suggesting a possible therapy for reducing cartilage
   injury and posttraumatic osteoarthritis by attenuating Piezo-mediated
   cartilage mechanotransduction of injurious strains.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a planar printed double-dipole antenna with broadband
   performance and high directivity is presented. The proposed antenna
   consists of two dipole elements, two pairs of parallel striplines and a
   microstrip balun. The main features of the designed antenna are the two
   dipole elements designed with different lengths and excited in the left
   and right parts with a pair of antiphase signals. The two dipole
   elements are designed with different lengths for achieving broadband
   performance. High directivity is obtained by feeding the two dipole
   elements with the two antiphase signals. In order to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed design, a prototype of the proposed
   antenna is fabricated and measured. Experimental results of the
   fabricated antenna have verified the effectiveness of the proposed
   design. Measured results show that the fabricated antenna provides a
   53.7\% impedance bandwidth ranging from 4.5 to 7.8 GHz and a measured
   gain better than 4 dBi. Good unidirectional radiation patterns with a
   high front-to-back ratio greater than 17 dB are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variability in root zone soil moisture content (w) exhibits a

   A hierarchy of models that sequentially introduce the spectrum of
   precipitation, net radiation, and the effect of w on evaporative and
   drainage losses was used to analyze the spectrum of w at subtropical and
   temperate forested sites. Reproducing the w spectra at long time scales
   necessitated simultaneous precipitation and net radiation measurements
   depending on site conditions. The w memory inferred from observed w
   spectra was 25-38 days, larger than that determined from maximum wet
   evapotranspiration and field capacity. The w memory can be reasonably
   inferred from the Lorentzian spectrum when precipitation and

Title = {{Aging of fullerene C-60 nanoparticle suspensions in the presence of
   microbes}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{282-289}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Despite the growing use of carbon nanomaterials in commercial
   applications, very little is known about the fate of these nanomaterials
   once they are released into the environment. The carbon-carbon bonding
   of spherical sp(2) hybridized fullerene (C-60) forms a strong and
   resilient material that resists biodegradation. Moreover, C-60 is widely
   reported to be bactericidal. Here however, we observe the changing
   properties of fullerene nanoparticle aggregates aged in the presence of
   microbes. C-60 aggregates were observed to decrease in size with aging,
   while hydroxylation and photosensitized reactivity measured by the
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased, suggesting that
   chemically and/or biologically-mediated activity is capable of partially
   transforming fullerene structure and reactivity in the environment.
   However, stable-isotope-labeling C-60 aggregates incubated with
   microbial cultures from aged suspensions for 203 days did not produce
   significant labeled carbon dioxide, despite significant reduction in
   aggregate radius for biological samples. These results suggest that
   either the rate of biodegradation of these particles is too slow to
   quantify or that the biologically-enhanced transformation of these
   particles does not occur through microbial biodegradation to carbon
   dioxide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   significantly cheaper computationally compared to the fully ab initio
   approach, can reliably predict the ordinal ranking of the thermal
   conductivity for several different classes of semiconductor materials.
   In particular, a high Pearson (i.e., linear) correlation is obtained

Abstract = {{The main impetus for a mini-symposium on corticothalamic
   interrelationships was the recent number of studies highlighting the
   role of the thalamus in aspects of cognition beyond sensory processing.
   The thalamus contributes to a range of basic cognitive behaviors that
   include learning and memory, inhibitory control, decision-making, and
   the control of visual orienting responses. Its functions are deeply
   intertwined with those of the better studied cortex, although the
   principles governing its coordination with the cortex remain opaque,
   particularly in higher-level aspects of cognition. How should the
   thalamus be viewed in the context of the rest of the brain? Although its
   role extends well beyond relaying of sensory information from the
   periphery, the main function of many of its subdivisions does appear to
   be that of a relay station, transmitting neural signals primarily to the
   cerebral cortex from a number of brain areas. In cognition, its main
   contribution may thus be to coordinate signals between diverse regions
   of the telencephalon, including the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala,
   and striatum. This central coordination is further subject to
   considerable extrinsic control, for example, inhibition from the basal
   ganglia, zona incerta, and pretectal regions, and chemical modulation
   from ascending neurotransmitter systems. What follows is a brief review
   on the role of the thalamus in aspects of cognition and behavior,
   focusing on a summary of the topics covered in a mini-symposium held at
   the Society for Neuroscience meeting, 2014.}},

Abstract = {{OpenWorm is an international collaboration with the aim of understanding
   how the behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) emerges from its
   underlying physiological processes. The project has developed a modular

   incorporate new experimental data and test hypotheses. The modeling
   framework incorporates both biophysical neuronal simulations and a novel
   fluid-dynamics-based soft-tissue simulation for physical
   environment-body interactions. The project's open-science approach is
   aimed at overcoming the difficulties of integrative modeling within a
   traditional academic environment. In this article the rationale is
   presented for creating the OpenWorm collaboration, the tools and

Title = {{Coupled-mode theory for film-coupled plasmonic nanocubes}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Planar metallic nanoparticles separated by nanoscale distances from a
   metal film support unique plasmonic resonances useful for controlling a
   wide range of photodynamic processes. The fundamental resonance of a
   film-coupled planar nanoparticle arises from a transmission-line mode
   localized between nanoparticle and film, whose properties can be roughly
   approximated by closed form expressions similar to those used in patch
   antenna theory. The insight provided by the analytical expressions, and
   the potential of achieving similar closed-form expressions for a range
   of plasmonic phenomenon such as spasing, fluorescence enhancement, and
   perfect absorbers, motivates a more detailed study of the film-coupled
   patch. Here, we present an expanded analytical analysis of the plasmonic
   patch geometry, applying an eigenmode expansion method to arrive at a
   more accurate description of the field distribution underneath a
   film-coupled plasmonic nanocube. The fields corresponding to the
   inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations are expanded in a set of lossless
   waveguide eigenmodes. Radiation damping and Ohmic losses are then
   perturbatively taken into account by considering an equivalent surface
   impedance. We find that radiative loss couples the lossless eigenmodes,
   leading to discernible features in the scattering spectra of the
   nanocubes. The method presented can be further applied to the case of
   point source excitations, in which accounting for all potential
   eigenmodes becomes essential.}},

Abstract = {{Hypertrophic scar (HSc) contraction following burn injury causes
   contractures. Contractures are painful and disfiguring. Current
   therapies are marginally effective. To study pathogenesis and develop
   new therapies, a murine model is needed. We have created a validated
   immune-competent murine HSc model. A third-degree burn was created on
   dorsum of C57BL/6 mice. Three days postburn, tissue was excised and
   grafted with ear skin. Graft contraction was analyzed and tissue
   harvested on different time points. Outcomes were compared with human
   condition to validate the model. To confirm graft survival, green
   fluorescent protein (GFP) mice were used, and histologic analysis was
   performed to differentiate between ear and back skin. Role of panniculus
   carnosus in contraction was analyzed. Cellularity was assessed with
   4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Collagen maturation was assessed with
   Picro-sirius red. Mast cells were stained with Toluidine blue.
   Macrophages were detected with F4/80 immune. Vascularity was assessed
   with CD31 immune. RNA for contractile proteins was detected by
   quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Elastic
   moduli of skin and scar tissue were analyzed using a microstrain
   analyzer. Grafts contracted to approximate to 45\% of their original
   size by day 14 and maintained their size. Grafting of GFP mouse skin
   onto wild-type mice, and analysis of dermal thickness and hair follicle
   density, confirmed graft survival. Interestingly, hair follicles
   disappeared after grafting and regenerated in ear skin configuration by
   day 30. Radiological analysis revealed that panniculus carnosus doesn't
   contribute to contraction. Microscopic analyses showed that grafts show
   increase in cellularity. Granulation tissue formed after day 3. Collagen
   analysis revealed increases in collagen maturation over time. CD31 stain
   revealed increased vascularity. Macrophages and mast cells were
   increased. qRT-PCR showed up-regulation of transforming growth factor
   beta, alpha smooth muscle actin, and rho-associated protein kinase 2 in
   HSc. Tensile testing revealed that human skin and scar tissues are
   tougher than mouse skin and scar tissues.}},

Abstract = {{A bioactive platform for the quantitative observation of cell migration
   is presented by (1) presenting migration factors in a well-defined
   manner on 2-D substrates, and (2) enabling continuous cell tracking.
   Well-defined substrate presentation is achieved by correctly orienting
   immobilized proteins (chemokines and cell adhesion molecules), such that
   the active site is accessible to cell surface receptors. A
   thiol-terminated self-assembled monolayer on a silica slide was used as
   a base substrate for subsequent chemistry. The thiol-terminated surface
   was converted to an immobilized metal ion surface using a
   maleimido-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) cross-linker that bound
   Histidine-tagged recombinant proteins on the surface with uniform
   distribution and specific orientation. This platform was used to study
   the influence of surface-immobilized chemokine SDF-1 alpha and cell
   adhesion molecule ICAM-1 on murine splenic B lymphocyte migration. While
   soluble SDF-1 alpha induced trans-migration in a Boyden Chamber type
   chemotaxis assay, immobilized SDF-1 alpha alone did not elicit
   significant surface-migration on our test-platform surface.
   Surface-immobilized cell adhesion protein, ICAM-1, in conjunction with
   activation enabled migration of this cell type on our surface.
   Controlled exposure to UV light was used to produce stable linear
   gradients of His-tagged recombinant SDF-1 alpha co-immobilized with
   ICAM-1 following our surface chemistry approach. XPS and antibody
   staining showed defined gradients of outwardly oriented SDF-1 alpha
   active sites. This test platform can be especially valuable for
   investigators interested in studying the influence of
   surface-immobilized factors on cell behavior and may also be used as a
   cell migration enabling platform for testing the effects of various
   diffusible agents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Infants show age-related improvements in reach straightness and
   smoothness over the first years of life as well as a decrease in average
   movement speed. This period of changing kinematics overlaps the
   emergence of handedness. We examined whether infant hand preference
   status is related to the development of motorcontrol in 53 infants
   ranging from 11 to 14 months old. Hand preference status was assessed
   from reaching to a set of 5 objects presented individually at the
   infant's midline: infants were classified into `right preference' or `no
   preference' groups. Three-dimensional (3-0) recordings were made of each
   arm for reaches under two distinct conditions: pick up a ball and fit it
   into the opening of a toy (grasp-to-place task) or pick up a Cheerio and
   consume it (grasp-to-eat task). Contrary to expectations, there was no
   effect of hand preference status on reach smoothness or straightness for
   either task. On the grasp-to-eat task only, average speed of the left
   hand differed as a function of hand preference status. Infants in the no
   preference group exhibited higher left hand average speeds than infants
   in the right preference group. Our results suggest that while behavioral
   differences in the use of the two hands may be present in some infants,
   these differences do not appear to be systematically linked to biases in
   motor control of the arms early in development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Traditional slit-based spectrometers have an inherent trade-off between
   spectral resolution and throughput that can limit their performance when
   measuring diffuse sources such as light returned from highly scattering
   biological tissue. Recently, multielement fiber bundles have been used
   to effectively measure diffuse sources, e. g., in the field of spatially
   offset Raman spectroscopy, by remapping the source (or some region of
   the source) into a slit shape for delivery to the spectrometer. Another
   approach is to change the nature of the instrument by using a coded
   entrance aperture, which can increase throughput without sacrificing
   spectral resolution. In this study, two spectrometers, one with a
   slit-based entrance aperture and the other with a coded aperture, were
   used to measure Raman spectra of an analyte as a function of the optical
   properties of an overlying scattering medium. Power-law fits reveal that
   the analyte signal is approximately proportional to the number of
   transport mean free paths of the scattering medium raised to a power of
   -0.47 (coded aperture instrument) or -1.09 (slit-based instrument).
   These results demonstrate that the attenuation in signal intensity is
   more pronounced for the slit-based instrument and highlight the
   scattering regimes where coded aperture instruments can provide an
   advantage over traditional slit-based spectrometers. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {{Aiming to reduce the reconstruction time and enhance the image quality
   of microwave induced thermal acoustic tomography (MITAT), a new image
   reconstruction method named HDCS-MITAT (HDCS: hierarchical dictionary
   compressive sensing) is proposed. Different from the recently
   demonstrated CS-MITAT (CS: compressive sensing) imaging method in which
   only one level dictionary is applied, hierarchical dictionaries are used
   in the HDCS-MITAT. In this method, the dictionaries with different
   spatial resolutions are constructed which constitute a hierarchical
   structure. During the image reconstructions, first the coarsest level
   dictionary is utilized to roughly estimate the position of the targets
   in the original image domain. A reduced interested image domain can be
   set based on this estimation. Then the next level dictionary which has
   higher resolution than the above level is applied to further estimating
   the position of the targets and so on. Finally, the finest level
   dictionary is used to reconstruct the image of the targets. Compared
   with the CS-MITAT, this HDCS-MITAT has much less computational time and
   better image quality. The effectiveness of the method has been validated
   through some simulations and real breast tumor experiments. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based algorithm is proposed for video
   reconstruction from temporally compressed video measurements. The GMM is
   used to model spatio-temporal video patches, and the reconstruction can
   be efficiently computed based on analytic expressions. The GMM-based
   inversion method benefits from online adaptive learning and parallel
   computation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed inversion
   method with videos reconstructed from simulated compressive video
   measurements, and from a real compressive video camera. We also use the
   GMM as a tool to investigate adaptive video compressive sensing, i.e.,
   adaptive rate of temporal compression.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nuclear spin hyperpolarization overcomes the sensitivity limitations of
   traditional NMR and MRI, but the most general method demonstrated to
   date (dynamic nuclear polarization) has significant limitations in
   scalability, cost, and complex apparatus design. As an alternative,
   signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) of parahydrogen on
   transition metal catalysts can hyperpolarize a variety of substrates,
   but to date this scheme has required transfer of the sample to low
   magnetic field or very strong RF irradiation. Here we demonstrate
   ``Low-Irradiation Generation of High Tesla-SABRE{''} (LIGHT-SABRE) which
   works with simple pulse sequences and low power deposition; it should be
   usable at any magnetic field and for hyperpolarization of many different
   nuclei. This approach could drastically reduce the cost and complexity
   of producing hyperpolarized molecules. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are a class of biopolymers consisting
   of the pentameric repeat (VPG alpha G)(n) based on the sequence of
   mammalian tropoelastin that display a thermally induced
   soluble-to-insoluble phase transition in aqueous solution. We have
   discovered a remarkably simple approach to driving the spontaneous
   self-assembly of high molecular weight ELPs into nanostructures by
   genetically fusing a short 1.5 kDa (XG(y))(z) assembly domain to one end
   of the ELP. Classical theories of self-assembly based on the geometric
   mass balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic block copolymers suggest
   that these highly asymmetric polypeptides should form spherical
   micelles. Surprisingly, when sufficiently hydrophobic amino acids (X)
   are presented in a periodic sequence such as (FGG)(8) or (YG)(8), these
   highly asymmetric polypeptides self-assemble into cylindrical micelles
   whose length can be tuned by the sequence of the morphogenic tag. These
   nanostructures were characterized by light scattering, tunable resistive
   pulse sensing, fluorescence spectrophotometry, and thermal turbidimetry,
   as well as by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and
   small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). These short assembly domains
   provide a facile strategy to control the size, shape, and stability of
   stimuli responsive polypeptide nanostructures.}},

Title = {{Wavefront modulation and subwavelength diffractive acoustics with an
   acoustic metasurface}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Metasurfaces are a family of novel wavefront-shaping devices with planar
   profile and subwavelength thickness. Acoustic metasurfaces with ultralow
   profile yet extraordinary wave manipulating properties would be highly
   desirable for improving the performance of many acoustic wave-based
   applications. However, designing acoustic metasurfaces with similar
   functionality to their electromagnetic counterparts remains challenging
   with traditional metamaterial design approaches. Here we present a
   design and realization of an acoustic metasurface based on tapered
   labyrinthine metamaterials. The demonstrated metasurface can not only
   steer an acoustic beam as expected from the generalized Snell's law, but
   also exhibits various unique properties such as conversion from
   propagating wave to surface mode, extraordinary beam-steering and
   apparent negative refraction through higher-order diffraction. Such
   designer acoustic metasurfaces provide a new design methodology for
   acoustic signal modulation devices and may be useful for applications
   such as acoustic imaging, beam steering, ultrasound lens design and
   acoustic surface wave-based applications.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their ability to strongly localize and enhance optical
   fields, plasmonic nanostructures have the potential to dramatically
   amplify the inherent nonlinear response of materials. We illustrate the
   impact of this plasmonic interaction by investigating the third-harmonic
   generation (THG) from a system of film-coupled nanostripes operating at
   1500 nm. Both the film and the stripes are gold, separated by a
   nanoscale layer of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) grown using atomic layer
   deposition. This nanoscale junction, with an ultrasmooth interface,
   forms a waveguide cavity resonator with a large and controllable
   electric field enhancement, whose plasmon resonance can be tuned
   independently by changing the stripe width. We study experimentally the
   dependence of THG on the field enhancement by varying the gap size
   between the stripe and the metal film while simultaneously maintaining a
   fixed plasmon resonance. The experiments are supported with numerical
   simulations in which nonlinear contributions of the dielectric spacer
   layer and the metal are considered. Enhancements of the THG of nearly 5
   orders of magnitude with respect to a bare metal film are measured
   experimentally for the smallest gap sizes, with a trend similar to that
   found in the numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Tsunami computational models are employed to explore multiple flooding
   scenarios and to predict water elevations. However, accurate estimation
   of water elevations requires accurate estimation of many model
   parameters including the Manning's n friction parameterization. Our
   objective is to develop an efficient approach for the uncertainty
   quantification and inference of the Manning's n coefficient which we
   characterize here by three different parameters set to be constant in
   the on-shore, near-shore and deep-water regions as defined using
   iso-baths. We use Polynomial Chaos (PC) to build an inexpensive
   surrogate for the GEOCLAW model and employ Bayesian inference to
   estimate and quantify uncertainties related to relevant parameters using
   the DART buoy data collected during the T (o) over bar hoku tsunami. The
   surrogate model significantly reduces the computational burden of the
   Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the Bayesian inference. The
   PC surrogate is also used to perform a sensitivity analysis. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate associations between breast cancer molecular
   subtype and semiautomatically extracted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
   features.
   Materials and Methods: Imaging and genomic data from the Cancer Genome
   Atlas and the Cancer Imaging Archive for 48 patients with breast cancer
   from four institutions in the United States were used in this
   institutional review board approval-exempt study. Computer vision
   algorithms were applied to extract 23 imaging features from lesions
   indicated by a breast radiologist on MR images. Morphologic, textural,
   and dynamic features were extracted. Molecular subtype was determined on
   the basis of genomic analysis. Associations between the imaging features
   and molecular subtype were evaluated by using logistic regression and
   likelihood ratio tests. The analysis controlled for the age of the
   patients, their menopausal status, and the orientation of the MR images
   (sagittal vs axial).
   Results: There is an association (P = .0015) between the luminal B
   subtype and a dynamic contrast material-enhancement feature that
   quantifies the relationship between lesion enhancement and background
   parenchymal enhancement. Cancers with a higher ratio of lesion
   enhancement rate to background parenchymal enhancement rate are more
   likely to be luminal B subtype.
   Conclusion: The luminal B subtype of breast cancer is associated with MR
   imaging features that relate the enhancement dynamics of the tumor and
   the background parenchyma. (C) RSNA, 2014}},

Abstract = {{Magnetodielectric materials have many emerging applications, but their
   scattering problems are challenging for volume integral equation
   solvers. In this paper, a mixed-order stabilized bi-conjugate gradient
   FFT (mixed-order BCGS-FFT) method for solving the scattering problem of
   magnetodielectric objects is presented. This method uses the volumetric
   roof-top basis functions as testing functions for the coupled field
   volume integral equation (CFVIE) and basis functions for the electric
   and magnetic flux (D,B) densities. However, unlike the conventional weak
   form BCGS-FFT methods for dielectric objects, the mixed-order BCGS-FFT
   method uses the second-order curl conforming basis functions for the
   electric and magnetic vector potentials (F, A). The curl conforming
   basis functions preserve the continuity of the tangential components for
   F and A, while the use of second-order basis functions avoids the zero
   terms caused by the divergence operations on the vector potentials.
   Numerical examples show excellent performance of the mixed-order
   BCGS-FFT method over the currently available BCGS-FFT method as well as
   high accuracy of the mixed-order BCGS-FFT method on large contrast
   magnetodielectric scatterers.}},

Abstract = {{Low-density parity-check (LDPC) convolutional codes (or spatially
   coupled codes) were recently shown to approach capacity on the binary
   erasure channel (BEC) and binary-input memoryless symmetric channels.
   The mechanism behind this spectacular performance is now called
   threshold saturation via spatial coupling. This new phenomenon is
   characterized by the belief-propagation threshold of the spatially
   coupled ensemble increasing to an intrinsic noise threshold defined by
   the uncoupled system. In this paper, we present a simple proof of
   threshold saturation that applies to a wide class of coupled scalar
   recursions. Our approach is based on constructing potential functions
   for both the coupled and uncoupled recursions. Our results actually show
   that the fixed point of the coupled recursion is essentially determined
   by the minimum of the uncoupled potential function and we refer to this
   phenomenon as Maxwell saturation. A variety of examples are considered
   including the density-evolution equations for: irregular LDPC codes on
   the BEC, irregular low-density generator-matrix codes on the BEC, a
   class of generalized LDPC codes with BCH component codes, the joint
   iterative decoding of LDPC codes on intersymbol-interference channels
   with erasure noise, and the compressed sensing of random vectors with
   independent identically distributed components.}},

Abstract = {{The local plasmon resonances of metallic nanostructures are commonly
   associated with massive local field enhancements, capable of increasing
   the photoexcitation of nearby quantum emitters by orders of magnitude.
   However, these same plasmonic structures support high densities of bound
   and dissipative states, often quenching the nearby emitter or at least
   offering competitive nonradiative channels. Thus, finding a plasmonic
   platform that supports massive field enhancements and a high proportion
   of radiating to nonradiating states remains an active and promising area
   of research. In this paper, we outline a simple method for numerically
   studying plasmonic enhancements in fluorescence and apply it to several
   variants of the film-coupled nanoparticle platform. Film-coupled
   nanoparticles make excellent candidates for these investigations since
   the gap dimension between nanoparticle and film-key to the enhancement
   mechanism-can be precisely controlled in experimental realizations. By
   correlating the properties of embedded fluorophores with the resonances
   of the film-coupled nanoparticles, we show quantum yield engineering
   that is nearly independent of the fluorophore's intrinsic quantum yield,
   yielding overall fluorescence enhancements of over four orders of
   magnitude. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{To move nanophotonic devices such as lasers and single-photon sources
   into the practical realm, a challenging list of requirements must be
   met, including directional emission(1-5), room-temperature and broadband
   operation(6-9), high radiative quantum efficiency(1,4) and a large
   spontaneous emission rate. To achieve these features simultaneously, a
   platform is needed for which the various decay channels of embedded
   emitters can be fully understood and controlled. Here, we show that all
   these device requirements can be satisfied by a film-coupled metal
   nanocube system with emitters embedded in the dielectric gap region.
   Fluorescence lifetime measurements on ensembles of emitters reveal
   spontaneous emission rate enhancements exceeding 1,000 while maintaining
   high quantum efficiency (>0.5) and directional emission (84\% collection
   efficiency). Using angle-resolved fluorescence measurements, we
   independently determine the orientations of emission dipoles in the
   nanoscale gap. Incorporating this information with the three-dimensional
   spatial distribution of dipoles into full-wave simulations predicts
   time-resolved emission in excellent agreement with experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Regions of vegetation transitions (ecotones) are known to be highly
   sensitive to climate fluctuations. In this study, the Cellular-Automata
   Tree Grass Shrub Simulator (CATGraSS) has been modified, calibrated and
   used with downscaled future climate scenarios to examine the role of
   climate change on vegetation patterns in a steep mountainous catchment
   (1.3 km(2)) located in Sicily, Italy. In the catchment, north-facing
   slopes are mostly covered by trees and grass, and south-facing slopes by
   Indian Fig opuntia and grass, with grasses dominating as elevation
   grows. CATGraSS simulates solar radiation, evapotranspiration, and soil
   moisture in space and time. Each model cell can hold a single plant type
   or can be bare soil. Plant competition is modeled explicitly through
   mortality and the establishment of individual plants in open spaces. In
   this study, CATGraSS is modified to account for heterogeneity in soil
   thickness and tested in the study catchment using the historical climate
   of the region. Predicted vegetation patterns are compared with those
   obtained from satellite images. Results of model under current climate
   underscore the importance of solar irradiance and soil thickness,
   especially in the uplands where soil is shallow, in determining
   vegetation composition over complex terrain. A stochastic weather
   generator is used to generate future climate change scenarios for the
   catchment by downscaling GCM realizations in space and time. Future
   increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration was considered through
   modifying the vegetation water use efficiency and stomatal resistance
   for our study site. Model results suggest that vegetation pattern is
   highly sensitive to temperature and rainfall variations provided by
   climate scenarios (30\% reduction of the annual precipitation and a 2.8
   degrees C increase of the mean annual temperature). Future climate

Abstract = {{The wide use of metal-based nanomaterials such as zinc oxide (ZnO)
   nanoparticles (NPs) has generated concerns regarding their environmental
   and health risks. For ZnO NPs, their toxicity in aquatic systems often
   depends on-the release of dissolved zinc species, and the rate of
   dissolution is influenced by Water chemistry, including the presence of
   zinc-chelating ligands. A challenge, however, remains in quantifying the
   dissolution of ZnO NPs, particularly for time scales that are short
   enough to determine rates. This paper reports the application of anodic
   stripping voltammetry (ASV) with a hanging mercury drop electrode to
   directly measure the concentration of dissolved zinc in ZnO NP
   suspensions, without separation of the ZnO NPs from the aqueous phase.
   The effects of the deposition time and the electrochemical potential
   scan rate on the ASV measurement were consistent with expectations for
   dissolved phase measurements. The dissolved zinc concentration measured
   by ASV ({[}Zn](ASV)) was compared with that measured by inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after ultracentrifugation
   ({[}Zn](ICP-MS)), for four types of ZnO NPs with different coatings and
   primary particle diameters. For small ZnO NPs (4-5 nm), {[}Zn](ASV) was
   20\% higher than {[}Zn](ICP-MS), suggesting that these small NPs
   contributed to the voltammetric measurement. For larger ZnO NPs
   (approximately 20 nm), {[}Zn](ASV) was (79 +/- 19)\% of {[}Zn](ICP-MS),
   despite the high concentrations of ZnO NPs in suspension. Using ASV, the
   dissolution of ZnO NPs was studied, with or without Suwannee River
   Fulvic Acid (SRFA). Although SRFA diminished the ASV stripping current,
   dissolution of 20 nm ZnO NPs was significantly promoted at high fulvic
   acid to ZnO NP ratios. The ASV method described in this paper provides a
   useful tool for studying the dissolution kinetics of ZnO NPs in complex
   environmental matrices.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in mapping white matter pathways in the brain has peaked with
   the recognition that altered brain connectivity may contribute to a
   variety of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Diffusion tractography
   has emerged as a popular method for postmortem brain mapping
   initiatives, including the ex-vivo component of the human connectome
   project, yet it remains unclear to what extent computer-generated tracks
   fully reflect the actual underlying anatomy. Of particular concern is
   the fact that diffusion tractography results vary widely depending on
   the choice of acquisition protocol. The two major acquisition variables
   that consume scan time, spatial resolution, and diffusion sampling, can
   each have profound effects on the resulting tractography. In this
   analysis, we determined the effects of the temporal tradeoff between
   spatial resolution and diffusion sampling on tractography in the ex-vivo
   rhesus macaque brain, a close primate model for the human brain. We used
   the wealth of autoradiography-based connectivity data available for the
   rhesus macaque brain to assess the anatomic accuracy of six time-matched
   diffusion acquisition protocols with varying balance between spatial and
   diffusion sampling. We show that tractography results vary greatly, even
   when the subject and the total acquisition time are held constant.
   Further, we found that focusing on either spatial resolution or
   diffusion sampling at the expense of the other is counterproductive. A
   balanced consideration of both sampling domains produces the most
   anatomically accurate and consistent results. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Commercially available implantable needle-type glucose sensors for
   diabetes management are robust analytically but can be unreliable
   clinically primarily due to tissue sensor interactions. Here, we present
   the physical, drug release and bioactivity characterization of tubular,
   porous dexamethasone (Dex)-releasing polyurethane coatings designed to
   attenuate local inflammation at the tissue sensor interface. Porous
   polyurethane coatings were produced by the salt-leaching/gas-foaming
   method. Scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography
   (micro-CT) showed controlled porosity and coating thickness. In vitro
   drug release from coatings monitored over 2 weeks presented an initial
   fast release followed by a slower release. Total release from coatings
   was highly dependent on initial drug loading amount. Functional in vitro
   testing of glucose sensors deployed with porous coatings against glucose
   standards demonstrated that highly porous coatings minimally affected
   signal strength and response rate. Bioactivity of the released drug was
   determined by monitoring Dex-mediated, dose-dependent apoptosis of human
   peripheral blood derived monocytes in culture. Acute animal studies were
   used to determine the appropriate Dex payload for the implanted porous
   coatings. Pilot short-term animal studies showed that Dex released from
   porous coatings implanted in rat subcutis attenuated the initial
   inflammatory response to sensor implantation. These results suggest that
   deploying sensors with the porous, Dex-releasing coatings is a promising
   strategy to improve glucose sensor performance. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{AimsClinical application of pudendal nerve (PN) afferent stimulation to
   restore bladder emptying in persons with neurological disorders requires
   increased stimulation-evoked voiding efficiencies (VEs). We tested the
   hypothesis that selective co-stimulation of multiple PN branches, either
   bilateral dorsal nerve of the penis (DNP) stimulation or selective
   stimulation of both the cranial sensory nerve (CSN) and DNP, will evoke
   larger reflex bladder contractions and result in higher VEs than
   stimulation of any single afferent pathway alone.
   MethodsWe measured the strength of bladder contractions, threshold
   volumes, and VEs produced by unilateral and bilateral stimulation of the
   DNP as well as singular and selective unilateral co-stimulation of the
   DNP and CSN in cats anesthetized with -chloralose.
   ResultsCo-stimulation of afferent pathways generated significantly
   larger isovolumetric bladder contractions and evoked contractions at
   lower threshold volumes than individual stimulation. Co-stimulation of
   pudendal afferents also suppressed dyssynergic activity in the external
   anal sphincter produced by low frequency individual stimulation. VE was
   significantly improved with co-stimulation (1726\% of distention evoked
   volumes) over individual stimulation (141 +/- 6\%).
   ConclusionsBoth types of co-stimulation evoked larger bladder
   contractions and increased VE over individual branch PN afferent
   stimulation and distention-evoked voiding. The decreased threshold
   volumes required for reflex bladder activation and increased VEs with
   co-stimulation support the use of stimulation of multiple individual
   stimulation-evoked reflexes to improve voiding efficiency. Neurourol.

Abstract = {{Macroscale scaffolds created from cartilage-derived matrix (CDM)
   demonstrate chondroinductive or chondroinductive properties, but many
   fabrication methods do not allow for control of nanoscale architecture.
   In this regard, electrospun scaffolds have shown significant promise for
   cartilage tissue engineering. However, nanofibrous materials generally
   exhibit a relatively small pore size and require techniques such as
   multilayering or the inclusion of sacrificial fibers to enhance cellular
   infiltration. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare
   multilayer to single-layer electrospun poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)
   scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering, and (2) to determine whether
   incorporation of CDM into the PCL fibers would enhance chondrogenesis by
   human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). PCL and PCL-CDM scaffolds were
   prepared by sequential collection of 60 electrospun layers from the
   surface of a grounded saline bath into a single scaffold, or by
   continuous electrospinning onto the surface of a grounded saline bath
   and harvest as a single-layer scaffold. Scaffolds were seeded with hASCs
   and evaluated over 28 days in culture. The predominant effects on hASCs
   of incorporation of CDM into scaffolds were to stimulate sulfated
   glycosaminoglycan synthesis and COL10A1 gene expression. Compared with
   single-layer scaffolds, multilayer scaffolds enhanced cell infiltration

   constructs, multilayer PCL constructs had a much lower elastic modulus,
   and PCL-CDM constructs had an elastic modulus approximately 1\% that of
   PCL constructs. These data suggest that multilayer electrospun
   constructs enhance homogeneous cell seeding, and that the inclusion of
   CDM stimulates chondrogenesis-related bioactivity. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Highly functional engineered skeletal muscle constructs could serve as
   physiological models of muscle function and regeneration and have
   utility in therapeutic replacement of damaged or diseased muscle tissue.
   In this study, we examined the roles of different myogenic cell
   fractions and culturing conditions in the generation of highly
   functional engineered muscle. Fibrin-based muscle bundles were
   fabricated using either freshly-isolated myogenic cells or their
   adherent fraction pre-cultured for 36 h. Muscle bundles made of these
   cells were cultured in both static and dynamic conditions and
   systematically characterized with respect to early myogenic events and
   contractile function. Following 2 weeks of culture, we observed both
   individual and synergistic benefits of using the adherent cell fraction
   and dynamic culture on muscle formation and function. In particular,
   optimal culture conditions resulted in significant increase in the total
   cross-sectional muscle area (similar to 3-fold), myofiber size (similar
   to 1.6-fold), myonuclei density (similar to 1.2-fold), and force
   generation (similar to 9-fold) compared to traditional use of
   freshly-isolated cells and static culture. Curiously, we observed that
   only a simultaneous use of the adherent cell fraction and dynamic
   culture resulted in accelerated formation of differentiated myofibers
   which were critical for providing a niche-like environment for
   maintenance of a satellite cell pool early during culture. Our study
   identifies key parameters for engineering large-size, highly functional
   skeletal muscle tissues with improved ability for retention of
   functional satellite cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of targets with
   complex motion such as fluctuating ships with oceanic waves and high
   maneuvering airplanes, the azimuth echo signals can be modeled as cubic
   phase signals (CPSs) after the migration compensation. The chirp rate
   (CR) and the quadratic chirp rate (QCR) are two important physical
   quantities of the CPS, which deteriorate the azimuth focusing quality
   due to the Doppler frequency shift. With these two quantities, other
   parameters can be estimated by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
   Therefore, the CPS can be uniquely determined by both CR and QCR. In
   this paper, based on the proposed generalized keystone transform and the
   parametric instantaneous autocorrelation function, a novel distribution
   of the CPS, known as the CR-QCR distribution (CRQCRD), is presented and
   applied in a newly proposed ISAR imaging algorithm for targets with
   complex motion. The CRQCRD is simple and only requires the FFT and the
   nonuniform FFT (NUFFT). Owing to the application of the NUFFT, the
   computational cost is saved, and the searching procedure is unnecessary
   for the nonuniformly spaced signal. Compared to other four
   representative methods for CPSs, the CRQCRD, which can acquire higher
   antinoise performance and no error propagation, is searching-free and
   more suitable for the situation of multitargets. Several simulation
   examples, analyses of the antinoise performance, and ISAR images
   validate the effectiveness of the CRQCRD and the corresponding ISAR
   imaging algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an algorithm for the fast computation of network
   reliability bounds is proposed. The evaluation of the network
   reliability is an intractable problem for very large networks, and hence
   approximate solutions based on reliability bounds have assumed
   importance. The proposed bounds computation algorithm is based on an
   efficient BDD representation of the reliability graph model and a novel
   search technique to find important minpaths/mincuts to quickly reduce
   the gap between the reliability upper and lower bounds. Furthermore, our
   algorithm allows the control of the gap between the two bounds by
   controlling the overall execution time. Therefore, a trade-off between
   prediction accuracy and computational resources can be easily made in
   our approach. The numerical results are presented for large real example
   reliability graphs to show the efficacy of our approach. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Engineered DNA-binding proteins that manipulate the human genome and
   transcriptome have enabled rapid advances in biomedical research. In
   particular, the RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been
   engineered to create site-specific double-strand breaks for genome
   editing or to direct targeted transcriptional regulation. A unique
   capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is multiplex genome engineering by
   delivering a single Cas9 enzyme and two or more single guide RNAs
   (sgRNAs) targeted to distinct genomic sites. This approach can be used
   to simultaneously create multiple DNA breaks or to target multiple
   transcriptional activators to a single promoter for synergistic
   enhancement of gene induction. To address the need for uniform and
   sustained delivery of multiplex CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering
   tools, we developed a single lentiviral system to express a Cas9
   variant, a reporter gene and up to four sgRNAs from independent RNA
   polymerase III promoters that are incorporated into the vector by a
   convenient Golden Gate cloning method. Each sgRNA is efficiently
   expressed and can mediate multiplex gene editing and sustained
   transcriptional activation in immortalized and primary human cells. This
   delivery system will be significant to enabling the potential of
   CRISPR/Cas9-basedmultiplex genome engineering in diverse cell types.}},

Abstract = {{Pairs of chemically equivalent (or nearly equivalent) spin-1/2 nuclei
   have been shown to create disconnected eigenstates that are very
   long-lived compared with the lifetime of pure magnetization (T-1). Here
   the classes of molecules known to have accessible long-lived states are
   extended to include those with chemically equivalent spin-1/2 nuclei
   accessed by coupling to nuclei with spin > 1/2, in this case deuterium.
   At first, this appears surprising because the quadrupolar interactions
   present in nuclei with spin > 1/2 are known to cause fast relaxation.
   Yet it is shown that scalar couplings between deuterium and carbon can
   guide population into and out of long-lived states, i.e., those immune
   from the dominant relaxation mechanisms. This implies that it may be
   practical to consider compounds with C-13 pairs directly bound to
   deuterium (or even N-14) as candidates for storage of polarization. In
   addition, experiments show that simple deuteration of molecules with
   C-13 pairs at their natural abundance is sufficient for successful
   lifetime measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial respiration rates decrease with soil drying, ceasing
   below water potentials around -15MPa. A proposed mechanism for this
   pattern is that under dry conditions, microbes are substrate limited
   because solute diffusivity is halted due to breaking of water film
   continuity. However, pore connectivity estimated from hydraulic
   conductivity and solute diffusivity (at Darcy's scale) is typically
   interrupted at much less negative water potentials than microbial
   respiration (-0.1 to -1MPa). It is hypothesized here that the more
   negative respiration thresholds than at the Darcy's scale emerge because
   microbial activity is restricted to microscale soil patches that retain
   some hydrological connectivity even when it is lost at the macroscale.
   This hypothesis is explored using results from percolation theory and
   meta-analyses of respiration-water potential curves and hydrological
   percolation points. When reducing the spatial scale from macroscale to
   microscale, hydrological and respiration thresholds become consistent,
   supporting the proposed hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation of pudendal afferents can inhibit bladder
   contractions and increase bladder capacity. Recent results suggest that
   stimulation-evoked bladder inhibition is mediated by a mechanism other
   than activation of sympathetic bladder efferents in the hypogastric
   nerve, generating alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition at the
   vesical ganglia and/or beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated direct
   inhibition of the detrusor muscle. We investigated several inhibitory
   neurotransmitters that may instead be necessary for stimulation-evoked
   inhibition and found that intravenous picrotoxin, a noncompetitive
   GABA(A) antagonist, significantly and reversibly blocked pudendal
   afferent stimulation-evoked inhibition of bladder contractions in a
   dose-dependent manner. Similarly, intravenous picrotoxin also blocked
   pudendal afferent stimulation-evoked inhibition of nociceptive bladder
   contractions evoked by acetic acid infusion. Furthermore, intrathecal
   administration of picrotoxin at the lumbosacral spinal cord also blocked
   bladder inhibition by pudendal afferent stimulation. On the other hand,
   glycinergic, adrenergic, or opioidergic mechanisms were not necessary
   for bladder inhibition evoked by pudendal afferent stimulation. These
   results identify a lumbosacral spinal GABAergic mechanism of bladder
   inhibition evoked by pudendal afferent stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of detecting target in system-dependent
   clutter (SDC) background with a single observation from the test cell is
   researched. Classical detectors, such as the generalized likelihood
   ratio detectors (GLRDs) and the adaptive matched filters (AMFs), etc.,
   usually deal with the clutter and the noise as a whole. The low rank
   detectors (LRDs) make use of the low rank property of the clutter to
   improve the detection performance. However, the performance of LRDs
   degrades when the signal is not orthogonal with respect to (w.r.t.) the
   clutter. In this paper, an adaptive subspace detector for SDC (SDC-ASD)
   background which deals with the clutter and the noise separately is
   proposed. The SDC-ASD designs the test statistic by replacing the signal
   and the clutter covariance matrix with their maximum likelihood
   estimations (MLEs). Its theoretical false alarm probability and
   detection probability are analytically deduced. Analytical results show
   that the test statistic has the form of non-central distribution.
   Besides, it is shown that the SDC-ASD has constant false alarm rate
   (CFAR) performance w.r.t. the clutter and the noise. Numerical
   experiments are provided to validate the detection performance of the
   SDC-ASD in dealing with the target detection in SDC background.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main drawbacks of three-dimensional (3-D) through-the-wall
   imaging (TWI) with synthetic aperture radar is the long data acquisition
   time. The movement of the target during the long data collection time in
   TWI causes smearing and target displacement in the image. In this paper,
   a generalized 3-D imaging algorithm is presented for TWI with
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar which is real time in data
   collection. The far field layered medium Green's function is
   incorporated in the MIMO through-the-wall beamformer to take into
   account and compensate for the wall effects. This makes the imaging
   algorithm simply applicable to the imaging of targets behind either
   single- or multilayered building walls, which has promising potential
   application in urban sensing of building interior targets. The MIMO
   through-the-wall beamformer can also be simply applied to
   two-dimensional TWI. Numerical results show that the through-the-wall
   MIMO beamformer provides high-quality focused images in various
   wall-target scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 50 years, significant progress has been made toward
   understanding how small single-domain proteins fold. However, very
   little is known about folding mechanisms of medium and large multidomain
   proteins that predominate the proteomes of all forms of life. Large
   proteins frequently fold cotranslationally and/or require chaperones.
   Firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase (Luciferase, 550 residues) has
   been a model of a cotranslationally folding protein whose extremely slow
   refolding (approximately days) is catalyzed by chaperones. However, the
   mechanism by which Luciferase misfolds and how chaperones assist
   Luciferase refolding remains unknown. Here we combine single-molecule
   force spectroscopy (atomic force microscopy (AFM)/single-molecule force
   spectroscopy) with steered molecular dynamic computer simulations to
   unravel the mechanism of chaperone-assisted Luciferase refolding. Our
   AFM and steered molecular dynamic results show that partially unfolded
   Luciferase, with the N-terminal domain remaining folded, can refold
   robustly without chaperones. Complete unfolding causes Luciferase to get
   trapped in very stable non-native configurations involving interactions
   between N- and C-terminal residues. However, chaperones allow the
   completely unfolded Luciferase to refold quickly in AFM experiments,
   strongly suggesting that chaperones are able to sequester non-natively
   contacting residues. More generally, we suggest that many chaperones,
   rather than actively promoting the folding, mimic the ribosomal exit
   tunnel and physically separate protein domains, allowing them to fold in
   a cotranslational-like sequential process.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we show how the cooling performance of a volumetrically heated
   solid can be increased by embedding high-conductivity tree-shaped
   designs in it. The volume fraction occupied by the high-conductivity
   material is fixed. Embedding the high-conductivity material as trees in
   the solid decreases the maximum temperature more than three times
   compared with distributing the high-conductivity material uniformly
   throughout the solid. The maximum temperature decreases as the number of
   the bifurcation levels and the volume fraction of the highly conductive
   material increase. The thermal resistance of the cube is the lowest when
   the diameter ratio of the mother and daughter branches at each pairing
   junction is 2. Changing from T-shaped to Y-shaped designs and from
   two-dimensional to three-dimensional designs decrease the maximum and
   the volume averaged temperatures. The peak temperature is the lowest in
   three-dimensional and Y-shaped designs. This paper shows that the peak
   temperature of the heated solid can be decreased by only varying the
   shape of the high-conductivity tree embedded in it. Copyright (c) 2014

Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Classifying behavior patterns in mouse models of neurological,
   psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders is critical for
   understanding disease causality and treatment. However, complete
   characterization of behavior is time-intensive, prone to subjective
   scoring, and often requires specialized equipment. Although several
   reports describe automated home-cage monitoring and individual task
   scoring methods, we report the first open source, comprehensive toolbox
   for automating the scoring of several common behavior tasks used by the
   neuroscience community. We show this new toolbox is robust and achieves
   equal or better consistency when compared to manual scoring methods. We
   use this toolbox to study the alterations in behavior that occur
   following blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI), and study if
   these behavior patterns are altered following genetic deletion of the
   transcription factor Ets-like kinase 1 (Elk-1). Due to the role of Elk-1
   in neuronal survival and proposed role in synaptic plasticity, we
   hypothesized that Elk-1 deletion would improve some neurobehavioral
   deficits, while impairing others, following blast exposure. In Elk-1
   knockout (KO) animals, deficits in open field, spatial object
   recognition (SOR) and elevated zero maze performance after blast
   exposure disappeared, while new significant deficits appeared in spatial
   and associative memory. These are the first data suggesting a molecular
   mediator of anxiety deficits following bTBI, and represent the utility
   of the broad screening tool we developed. More broadly, we envision this
   open-source toolbox will provide a more consistent and rapid analysis of
   behavior across many neurological diseases, promoting the rapid
   discovery of novel pathways mediating disease progression and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{From an enterprise perspective, one key motivation to transform the
   traditional IT management into Cloud is the cost reduction of the hosted
   services. In an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Cloud, virtual
   machine (VM) instances share the physical machines (PMs) in the
   provider's data center. With large number of PMs, providers can maintain
   low cost of service downtime at the expense of higher infrastructure and
   other operational costs (e.g., power consumption and cooling costs).
   Hence, determining the optimal PM capacity requirements that minimize
   the overall cost is of interest. In this paper, we show how a cost
   analysis and optimization framework can be developed using stochastic
   availability and performance models of an IaaS Cloud. Specifically, we
   study two cost minimization problems to address the capacity planning in
   an IaaS Cloud: 1) what is the optimal number of PMs that minimizes the
   total cost of ownership for a given downtime requirement set by service
   level agreements? and, 2) is it more economical to use cheaper but less
   reliable PMs or to use costlier but more reliable PMs for insuring the
   same availability characteristics? We use simulated annealing, a
   well-known stochastic search algorithm, to solve these optimization
   problems. Results from our analysis show that the optimal solutions are
   found within reasonable time.}},

Abstract = {{Although cervical softening is critical in pregnancy, there currently is
   no objective method for assessing the softness of the cervix. Shear wave
   speed (SWS) estimation is a noninvasive tool used to measure tissue
   mechanical properties such as stiffness. The goal of this study was to
   determine the spatial variability and assess the ability of SWS to
   classify ripened versus unripened tissue samples. Ex vivo human
   hysterectomy samples (n = 22) were collected; a subset (n = 13) were
   ripened. SWS estimates were made at 4 to 5 locations along the length of
   the canal on both anterior and posterior halves. A linear mixed model
   was used for a robust multivariate analysis. Receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) analysis and the area under the ROC curve (AUC)
   were calculated to describe the utility of SWS to classify ripened
   versus unripened tissue samples. Results showed that all variables used
   in the linear mixed model were significant (p < 0.05). Estimates at the
   mid location for the unripened group were 3.45 +/- 0.95 m/s (anterior)
   and 3.56 +/- 0.92 m/s (posterior), and 2.11 +/- 0.45 m/s (anterior) and
   2.68 +/- 0.57 m/s (posterior) for the ripened (p < 0.001). The AUCs were
   0.91 and 0.84 for anterior and posterior, respectively, suggesting that
   SWS estimates may be useful for quantifying cervical softening.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) matrix arrays
   were fabricated containing novel through-silicon interconnects and
   integrated into intracardiac catheters for in vivo real-time 3-D

   active elements were fabricated and operated at 5 MHz. The arrays were
   bulk micromachined in silicon-on-insulator substrates, and contained
   flexural unimorph membranes comprising the device silicon, lead
   zirconate titanate (PZT), and electrode layers. Through-silicon
   interconnects were fabricated by depositing a thin-film conformal copper
   layer in the bulk micromachined via under each PMUT membrane and
   photolithographically patterning this copper layer on the back of the
   substrate to facilitate contact with the individually addressable matrix
   array elements. Cable assemblies containing insulated 45-AWG copper
   wires and a termination silicon substrate were thermocompression bonded
   to the PMUT substrate for signal wire interconnection to the PMUT array.
   Side-viewing 14-Fr catheters were fabricated and introduced through the
   femoral vein in an adult porcine model. Real-time 3-D images were

Abstract = {{Recent advances in flow-based microfluidics have led to the emergence of
   biochemistry-on-a-chip as a new paradigm in clinical diagnostics and
   biomolecular recognition. However, a potential roadblock in the
   deployment of microfluidic biochips is the lack of test techniques to
   screen defective devices before they are used for biochemical analysis.
   Defective chips lead to repetition of experiments, which is undesirable
   due to high reagent cost and limited availability of samples. Prior work
   on fault detection in biochips has been limited to digital
   ({''}droplet{''}) microfluidics and other electrode-based technology
   platforms. The paper proposes the first approach for automated testing
   of flow-based microfluidic biochips that are designed using
   membrane-based valves for flow control. The proposed test technique is
   based on a behavioral abstraction of physical defects in microchannels
   and valves. The flow paths and flow control in the microfluidic device
   are modeled as a logic circuit composed of Boolean gates, which allows
   test generation to be carried out using standard automatic test pattern
   generation tools. The tests derived using the logic circuit model are
   then mapped to fluidic operations involving pumps and pressure sensors
   in the biochip. Feedback from pressure sensors can be compared to
   expected responses based on the logic circuit model, whereby the types
   and positions of defects are identified. We show how a fabricated
   biochip can be tested using the proposed method, and demonstrate
   experimental results for two additional fabricated chips.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a microwave imaging system that combines advances in
   metamaterial aperture design with emerging computational imaging
   techniques. The flexibility inherent to guided-wave, complementary
   metamaterials enables the design of a planar antenna that illuminates a
   scene with dramatically varying radiation patterns as a function of
   frequency. As frequency is swept over the K-band (17.5-26.5 GHz), a
   sequence of pseudorandom radiation patterns interrogates a scene.
   Measurements of the return signal versus frequency are then acquired and
   the scene is reconstructed using computational imaging methods. The
   low-cost, frequency-diverse static aperture allows three-dimensional
   images to be formed without mechanical scanning or dynamic beam-forming
   elements. The metamaterial aperture is complementary to a variety of
   computational imaging schemes, and can be used in conjunction with other
   sensors to form a multifunctional imaging platform. We illustrate the
   potential of multisensor fusion by integrating an infrared
   structured-light and optical image sensor to accelerate the microwave
   scene reconstruction and to provide a simultaneous visualization of the
   scene. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is an emerging technology for
   high-density semiconductor patterning. Multilayer distortion caused by
   mask defects is regarded as one of the critical challenges of EUV
   lithography. To simulate the influence of the defected nanoscale
   structures with high accuracy and efficiency, we have developed a
   boundary integral spectral element method (BI-SEM) that combines the SEM
   with a set of surface integral equations. The SEM is used to solve the
   interior computational domain, while the open boundaries are truncated
   by the surface integral equations. Both two-dimensional (2D) and
   three-dimensional (3D) EUV cases are simulated. Through comparing the
   performance of this method with the conventional finite element method
   (FEM), it is shown that the proposed BI-SEM can greatly decrease both
   the memory cost and the computation time. For typical 2D problems, we
   show that the BI-SEM is 11 and 1.25 times more efficient than the FEM in
   terms of memory and CPU time, respectively, while for 3D problems, these
   factors are over 14 and 2, respectively, for smaller problems; realistic
   3D problems that cannot be solved by the conventional FEM can be
   accurately simulated by the BI-SEM. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer have shown remarkable promise. A
   critical barrier to successfully executing such immune-mediated
   interventions is the selection of safe yet immunogenic targets. As
   patient deaths have occurred when tumor-associated antigens shared by
   normal tissue have been targeted by strong cellular immunotherapeutic
   platforms, route of delivery, target selection and the immune-mediated
   approach undertaken must work together to maximize efficacy with safety.
   Selected tumor-specific targets can spare potential toxicity to normal
   tissue; however, they are far less common than tumor-associated antigens
   and may not be present on all patients. In the context of immunotherapy
   for high-grade glioma, 2 of the most prominently studied antigens are
   the tumor-associated epidermal growth factor receptor and its
   tumor-specific genetic deletion variant III. In this review, we will
   summarize the immune-mediated strategies employed against these targets

Abstract = {{Shape-controlled synthesis of nanomaterials through a simple,
   continuous, and low-cost method is essential to nanomaterials research
   toward practical applications. Hydrodynamic focusing, with its
   advantages of simplicity, low-cost, and precise control over reaction
   conditions, has been used for nanomaterial synthesis. While most studies
   have focused on improving the uniformity and size control, few have
   addressed the potential of tuning the shape of the synthesized
   nanomaterials. Here we demonstrate a facile method to synthesize hybrid
   materials by three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing (3D-HF). While
   keeping the flow rates of the reagents constant and changing only the
   flow rate of the buffer solution, the molar ratio of two reactants
   (i.e., tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and HAuCl4) within the reaction zone
   varies. The synthesized TTF-Au hybrid materials possess very different
   and predictable morphologies. The reaction conditions at different
   buffer flow rates are studied through computational simulation, and the
   formation mechanisms of different structures are discussed. This simple
   one-step method to achieve continuous shape-tunable synthesis highlights
   the potential of 3D-HF in nanomaterials research.}},

   cartilage}},
Journal = {{MATRIX BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{25-32}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Chondrocytes in articular cartilage are surrounded by a narrow
   pericellular matrix (PCM) that is both biochemically and biomechanically
   distinct from the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tissue. While the
   PCM was first observed nearly a century ago, its role is still under
   investigation. In support of early hypotheses regarding its function,
   increasing evidence indicates that the PCM serves as a transducer of
   biochemical and biomechanical signals to the chondrocyte. Work over the
   past two decades has established that the PCM in adult tissue is defined
   biochemically by several molecular components, including type VI
   collagen and perlecan. On the other hand, the biomechanical properties
   of this structure have only recently been measured. Techniques such as
   micropipette aspiration, in situ imaging, computational modeling, and
   atomic force microscopy have determined that the PCM exhibits distinct
   mechanical properties as compared to the ECM, and that these properties
   are influenced by specific PCM components as well as disease state.
   Importantly, the unique relationships among the mechanical properties of
   the chondrocyte, PCM, and ECM in different zones of cartilage suggest
   that this region significantly influences the stress-strain environment
   of the chondrocyte. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the
   measurement of PCM mechanical properties and structure that further
   increase our understanding of PCM function. Taken together, these
   studies suggest that the PCM plays a critical role in controlling the
   mechanical environment and mechanobiology of cells in cartilage and
   other cartilaginous tissues, such as the meniscus or intervertebral
   disc. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC

Abstract = {{Infectious biofilms are problematic in many healthcare-related devices
   and are especially challenging and ubiquitous in urinary catheters. This
   report presents an on-demand fouling-release methodology to mechanically
   disrupt and remove biofilms, and proposes this method for the active
   removal of infectious biofilms from the previously inaccessible main
   drainage lumen of urinary catheters. Mature Proteus mirabilis
   crystalline biofilms detach from silicone elastomer substrates upon
   application of strain to the substrate, and increasing the strain rate
   increases biofilm detachment. The study presents a quantitative
   relationship between applied strain rate and biofilm debonding through
   an analysis of biofilm segment length and the driving force for
   debonding. Based on this mechanism, hydraulic and pneumatic elastomer
   actuation is used to achieve surface strain selectively within the lumen
   of prototypes of sections of a fouling-release urinary catheter.
   Proof-of-concept prototypes of sections of active, fouling-release
   catheters are constructed using techniques typical to soft robotics
   including 3D printing and replica molding, and those prototypes
   demonstrate release of mature P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms (e.g.,
   approximate to 90\%) from strained surfaces. These results provide a
   basis for the development of a new urinary catheter technology in which
   infectious biofilms are effectively managed through new methods that are
   entirely complementary to existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectrometry provides an
   excellent tool to characterize chemical constituents in Traditional
   Chinese Medicines (TCMs) without requiring separation and extraction
   procedures. This study involved the use of SERS to analyze two TCMs,
   namely Coptis chinensis and Phellodendron amurense, and their main
   active constituent, berberine. Using silver nanospheres as SERS-active
   probes, the decoctions of two raw TCMs and their counterfeits were
   analyzed. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the
   expected Raman spectrum of berberine, and liquid chromatography- mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS) was used as a comparative technique to quantify the
   amount of berberine in the samples. The results of the SERS measurements
   were consistent with the results of DFT calculations and LCMS analyses.
   To our knowledge, this is the first time that the potential of SERS was
   demonstrated as a sensitive, rapid, and non-destructive method to
   qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the active constituents in raw
   TCM products. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Among the various metrics to quantify CT radiation dose, organ dose is
   generally regarded as one of the best to reflect patient radiation
   burden. Organ dose is dependent on two main factors, namely patient
   anatomy and irradiation field. An accurate estimation of organ dose
   requires detailed modeling of both factors. The modeling of patient
   anatomy needs to reflect the anatomical diversity and complexity across
   the population so that the attributes of a given clinical patient can be
   properly accounted for. The modeling of the irradiation field needs to
   accurately reflect the CT system condition, especially the tube current
   modulation (TCM) technique. We present an atlas-based method to model
   patient anatomy via a library of computational phantoms with
   representative ages, sizes and genders. A clinical patient is matched
   with a corresponding computational phantom to obtain a representation of
   patient anatomy. The irradiation field of the CT system is modeled using
   a validated Monte Carlo simulation program. The tube current modulation
   profiles are simulated using a manufacturer-generalizable ray-tracing
   algorithm. Combining the patient model, Monte Carlo results, and TCM
   profile, organ doses are obtained by multiplying organ dose values from
   a fixed mA scan (normalized to CTDIvol-normalized, denoted as h (organ)
   ) and an adjustment factor that reflects the specific irradiation of
   each organ. The accuracy of the proposed method was quantified by
   simulating clinical abdominopelvic examinations of 58 patients. The
   predicted organ doses showed good agreement with simulated organ dose
   across all organs and modulation schemes. For an average CTDIvol of a CT
   exam of 10 mGy, the absolute median error across all organs was 0.64 mGy
   (-0.21 and 0.97 for 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively). The
   percentage differences were within 15\%. The study demonstrates that it
   is feasible to estimate organ doses in clinical CT examinations for
   protocols without and with tube current modulation. The methodology can
   be used for both prospective and retrospective estimation of organ dose.}},

Abstract = {{With the increased importance of CT radiation dose to health care
   providers, patients and the general public, there is an increased
   responsibility to minimize patient dose effectively. Bismuth shields
   offer a simple strategy to reduce dose to certain anterior
   radiosensitive organs such as breasts and eyes. However, in order to
   reduce organ dose they must be used properly; improper use can lead to
   an actual increase in the patient dose. They also create a proportional
   increase in image noise in the section of the body adjacent to the
   shield and further reduce the quantitative precision of CT numbers. In
   addition, shielding can degrade the overall efficiency (by an order of
   approximately 10\%) of the imaging process, reducing the theoretical
   image quality that can be expected from a certain level of patient dose.
   However, in spite of their significant disadvantages, there are certain
   clinical situations and practice considerations that provide qualified
   justification for their continued use.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear damping suspension is a promising method to be used in a
   rotor-bearing system for vibration isolation between the bearing and
   environment. However, the nonlinearity of the suspension may influence
   the stability of the rotor-bearing system. In this paper, the motions of
   a flexible rotor in short journal bearings with nonlinear damping
   suspension are studied. A computational method is used to solve the
   equations of motion, and the bifurcation diagrams, orbits, Poincar,
   maps, and amplitude spectra are used to display the motions. The results
   show that the effect of the nonlinear damping suspension on the motions
   of the rotor-bearing system depends on the speed of rotor: (a) For low
   speeds, the rotor- bearing system presents the same motion pattern under
   the nonlinear damping () suspension as for the linear damping ()
   suspension; (b) For high speeds, the effect of nonlinear damping depends
   on a combination of the damping exponent and damping coefficient. The
   square root damping model () shows a wider stable speed range than the
   linear damping for large damping coefficients. The quadratic damping ()
   shows similar results to linear damping with some special damping
   coefficients. The cubic damping () shows more stable response than the
   linear damping in general.}},

Abstract = {{Tremendous research efforts have been conducted studying the capturing
   and conversion of solar energy. Solar thermal power systems offer a
   compelling opportunity for renewable energy utilization with high
   efficiencies and excellent cost-effectiveness. The goal of this work was
   to design a non-concentrating collector, capable of reaching stagnation
   temperatures above 250 degrees C and fluid outlet temperatures under
   flow above 200 degrees C at 1000 W/m(2) solar irradiance. The study
   provides a detailed description of the methods and materials for
   construction of non-concentrating, high-temperature, evacuated solar
   collectors, the output fluid temperature depending on the input flow
   rate of working fluid in a low-flow rate, high-temperature regime, and
   an analytical description of the heat transfer between the collector and
   the working fluid. Temperature gains compared to ambient far above 200
   degrees C were possible under solar irradiance of 1000 W/m(2) with
   collector efficiencies of 30\% and more. For a temperature gain of 227
   degrees C (fluid outlet temperature 253 degrees C), the collector
   efficiency was 30\%, and for a temperature gain of 214 degrees C (fluid
   outlet temperature 240 degrees C), the collector efficiency was 49\%.
   This result opens up many new uses for non-concentrating solar
   collectors in fields such as power generation, fuel reforming, and
   catalysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread use of plasmonic nanorulers (PNRs) in sensing platforms
   has been plagued by technical challenges associated with the development
   of methods to fabricate precisely controlled nanostructures with high
   yield and characterize them with high throughput. We have previously
   shown that creating PNRs in a nanoparticle-film (NP-film) format enables
   the fabrication of an extremely large population of uniform PNRs with
   100\% yield using a self-assembly approach, which facilitates
   high-throughput PNR characterization using ensemble spectroscopic
   measurements and eliminates the need for expensive microscopy systems
   required by many other PNR platforms. We expand upon this prior work
   herein, showing that the NP-film PNR can be made compatible with aqueous
   sensing studies by adapting it for use in a transmission localized
   surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy format, where the coupled NP-film
   resonance responsible for the PNR signal is directly probed using an
   extinction measurement from a standard spectrophotometer. We designed
   slide holders that fit inside standard spectrophotometer cuvettes and
   position NP-film samples so that the coupled NP-film resonance can be
   detected in a collinear optical configuration. Once the NP-film PNR
   samples are cuvette-compatible, it is straightforward to calibrate the
   PNR in aqueous solution and use it to characterize dynamic,
   angstrom-scale distance changes resulting from pH-induced swelling of
   polyelectrolyte (PE) spacer layers as thin as 1 PE layer and also of a
   self-assembled monolayer of an amine-terminated alkanethiol. This
   development is an important step toward making PNR sensors more
   user-friendly and encouraging their widespread use in various sensing
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) with the repeat sequence of VPGVG are
   widely used as a model system for investigation of lower critical
   solution temperature (LCST) transition behavior. In this paper, the
   effect of temperature on the structure, dynamics and association of
   (VPGVG)(18) in aqueous solution is investigated using atomistic
   molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations show that as the
   temperature increases the ELP backbones undergo gradual conformational
   changes, which are attributed to the formation of more ordered secondary
   structures such as a-strands. In addition, increasing temperature
   changes the hydrophobicity of the ELP by exposure of hydrophobic
   valine-side chains to the solvent and hiding of proline residues. Based
   on our simulations, we conclude that the transition behavior of
   (VPGVG)(18) can be attributed to a combination of thermal disruption of
   the water network that surrounds the polypeptide, reduction of solvent
   accessible surface area of the polypeptide, and increase in its
   hydrophobicity. Simulations of the association of two (VPGVG)(18)
   molecules demonstrated that the observed gradual changes in the
   structural properties of the single polypeptide chain are enough to
   cause the aggregation of polypeptides above the LCST. These results lead
   us to propose that the LCST phase behavior of poly(VPGVG) is a
   collective phenomenon that originates from the correlated gradual
   changes in single polypeptide structure and the abrupt change in
   properties of hydration water around the peptide and is a result of a
   competition between peptide-peptide and peptide-water interactions. This
   is a computational study of an important intrinsically disordered
   peptide system that provides an atomic-level description of structural
   features and interactions that are relevant in the LCST phase behavior.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel fully automated algorithm for the detection of

   algorithm utilizes multiscale histograms of oriented gradient
   descriptors as feature vectors of a support vector machine based

   consisted of volumetric scans acquired from 45 subjects: 15 normal
   subjects, 15 patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD),
   and 15 patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). Our classifier
   correctly identified 100\% of cases with AMD, 100\% cases with DME, and
   86.67\% cases of normal subjects. This algorithm is a potentially
   impactful tool for the remote diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases. (C)2014

Abstract = {{This study examines whether and how land atmosphere interactions can
   have an impact on nocturnal convection over the southern Great Plains
   (SGP) through numerical simulations of an intense nocturnal mesoscale
   convective system (MCS) on 19-20 June 2007 with the Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) Model. High-resolution nested simulations were
   conducted using realistic and idealized land surfaces and two planetary
   boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations (PBLp): Yonsei University (YSU)
   and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ). Differences in timing and amount of MCS
   precipitation among observations and model results were examined in the
   light of daytime land atmosphere interactions, nocturnal prestorm
   environment, and cold pool strength. At the meso-gamma scale, land cover
   and soil type have as much of an effect on the simulated prestorm
   environment as the choice of PBLp: MYJ simulations exhibit strong
   sensitivity to changes in the land surface in contrast to negligible
   impact in the case of YSU. At the end of the afternoon, as the boundary
   layer collapses, a more homogeneous and deeper PBL (and stronger
   low-level shear) is evident for YSU as compared to MYJ when initial
   conditions and land surface properties are the same. At the meso-beta
   scale, propagation speed is faster and organization (bow echo
   morphology) and cold pool strength are enhanced when nocturnal PBL
   heights are higher, and there is stronger low-level shear in the
   prestorm environment independent of the boundary layer parameterization
   for different land surface conditions. A comparison of one- and two-way
   nested MYJ results demonstrates how daytime land atmosphere interactions
   modify the prestorm environment remotely through advection of low-level
   thermodynamic features. This remote feedback strongly impacts the MCS
   development phase as well as its spatial organization and propagation
   velocity and, consequently, nocturnal rainfall. These results indicate
   that synoptic- and meso-alpha-scale dynamics can play an important role
   in determining the spatial and temporal scales over which precipitation
   feedbacks of land atmosphere interactions emerge regionally. Finally,
   this study demonstrates the high degree of uncertainty in defining the
   spatial and temporal scales of land atmosphere interactions where and
   when organized convection is dominant.}},

Title = {{Controllable pulse parameter transcranial magnetic stimulator with
   enhanced circuit topology and pulse shaping}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective. This work aims at flexible and practical pulse parameter
   control in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is currently
   very limited in commercial devices. Approach. We present a third
   generation controllable pulse parameter device (cTMS3) that uses a novel
   circuit topology with two energy-storage capacitors. It incorporates
   several implementation and functionality advantages over conventional
   TMS devices and other devices with advanced pulse shape control. cTMS3
   generates lower internal voltage differences and is implemented with
   transistors with a lower voltage rating than prior cTMS devices. Main
   results. cTMS3 provides more flexible pulse shaping since the circuit
   topology allows four coil-voltage levels during a pulse, including
   approximately zero voltage. The near-zero coil voltage enables snubbing
   of the ringing at the end of the pulse without the need for a separate
   active snubber circuit. cTMS3 can generate powerful rapid pulse
   sequences (< 10 ms inter pulse interval) by increasing the width of each
   subsequent pulse and utilizing the large capacitor energy storage,
   allowing the implementation of paradigms such as paired-pulse and
   quadripulse TMS with a single pulse generation circuit. cTMS3 can also
   generate theta (50 Hz) burst stimulation with predominantly
   unidirectional electric field pulses. The cTMS3 device functionality and
   output strength are illustrated with electrical output measurements as
   well as a study of the effect of pulse width and polarity on the active
   motor threshold in ten healthy volunteers. Significance. The cTMS3
   features could extend the utility of TMS as a research, diagnostic, and
   therapeutic tool.}},

Abstract = {{Structural DNA nanotechnology, and specifically scaffolded DNA origami,
   is rapidly developing as a versatile method for bottom-up fabrication of
   novel nanometer-scale materials and devices. However, lengths of
   conventional single-stranded scaffolds, for example, 7,249-nucleotide
   circular genomic DNA from the M13mp18 phage, limit the scales of these
   uniquely addressable structures. Additionally, increasing DNA origami
   size generates the cost burden of increased staple-strand synthesis. We
   addressed this 2-fold problem by developing the following methods: (1)
   production of the largest to-date biologically derived single-stranded
   scaffold using a lambda/M13 hybrid virus to produce a 51 466-nucleotide
   DNA in a circular, single-stranded form and (2) inexpensive DNA
   synthesis via an inkjet-printing process on a chip embossed with
   functionalized micropillars made from cyclic olefin copolymer. We have
   experimentally demonstrated very efficient assembly of a 51-kilobasepair
   origami from the lambda/M13 hybrid scaffold folded by chip-derived
   staple strands. In addition, we have demonstrated two-dimensional,
   asymmetric origami sheets with controlled global curvature such that
   they land on a substrate in predictable orientations that have been
   verified by atomic force microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The recapitulation of the material properties and structure of the
   native aortic valve leaflet, specifically its anisotropy and laminate
   structure, is a major design goal for scaffolds for heart valve tissue
   engineering. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels are attractive
   scaffolds for this purpose as they are biocompatible, can be modified
   for their mechanical and biofunctional properties, and can be laminated.
   This study investigated augmenting PEG hydrogels with polycaprolactone
   (PCL) as an analog to the fibrosa to improve strength and introduce
   anisotropic mechanical behavior. However, due to its hydrophobicity, PCL
   must be modified prior to embedding within PEG hydrogels. In this study,
   PCL was electrospun (ePCL) and modified in three different ways, by
   protein adsorption (pPCL), alkali digestion (hPCL), and acrylation
   (aPCL). Modified PCL of all types maintained the anisotropic elastic
   moduli and yield strain of unmodified anisotropic ePCL. Composites of
   PEG and PCL (PPCs) maintained anisotropic elastic moduli, but aPCL and
   pPCL had isotropic yield strains. Overall, PPCs of all modifications had
   elastic moduli of 3.79 +/- 0.90 MPa and 0.46 +/- 0.21 MPa in the
   parallel and perpendicular directions, respectively. Valvular
   interstitial cells seeded atop anisotropic aPCL displayed an actin
   distribution aligned in the direction of the underlying fibers. The
   resulting scaffold combines the biocompatibility and tunable fabrication
   of PEG with the strength and anisotropy of ePCL to form a foundation for
   future engineered valve scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial leucine transporter LeuT retains significant secondary
   structure similarities to the human monoamine transporters (MAT) such as
   the dopamine and serotonin reuptake proteins. The primary method of
   computational study of the MATs has been through the use of the
   crystallized LeuT structure. Different conformations of LeuT can give
   insight into mechanistic details of the MAT family. A conformational
   sampling performed through accelerated molecular dynamics simulations
   testing different combinations of the leucine substrate and bound sodium
   ions revealed seven distinct conformational clusters. Further analysis
   has been performed to target salt-bridge residues R30-D404, Y108-F253,
   and R5-D369 and transmembrane domains on both the seven isolated
   structures and the total trajectories. In addition, solvent

Title = {{Stretchable and High-Performance Supercapacitors with Crumpled Graphene
   Papers}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Fabrication of unconventional energy storage devices with high
   stretchability and performance is challenging, but critical to practical
   operations of fully power-independent stretchable electronics. While
   supercapacitors represent a promising candidate for unconventional
   energy-storage devices, existing stretchable supercapacitors are limited
   by their low stretchability, complicated fabrication process, and high
   cost. Here, we report a simple and low-cost method to fabricate
   extremely stretchable and high-performance electrodes for
   supercapacitors based on new crumpled-graphene papers.
   Electrolyte-mediated-graphene paper bonded on a compliant substrate can
   be crumpled into self-organized patterns by harnessing mechanical
   instabilities in the graphene paper. As the substrate is stretched, the
   crumpled patterns unfold, maintaining high reliability of the graphene
   paper under multiple cycles of large deformation. Supercapacitor
   electrodes based on the crumpled graphene papers exhibit a unique
   combination of high stretchability (e.g, linear strain similar to 300\%,
   areal strain similar to 800\%), high electrochemical performance (e.g.,
   specific capacitance similar to 196 F g(-1)), and high reliability
   (e.g., over 1000 stretch/relax cycles). An all-solid-state
   supercapacitor capable of large deformation is further fabricated to
   demonstrate practical applications of the crumpled-graphene-paper
   electrodes. Our method and design open a wide range of opportunities for
   manufacturing future energy-storage devices with desired deformability
   together with high performance.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft wings carrying stores are susceptible to nonlinear aeroelastic
   limit-cycle oscillations, which can lead to reduced flight and mission
   performance. Limit-cycle-oscillation dynamics and control simulation
   studies, although of great importance, are often based on simplified
   typical-section airfoil models. In this work, the more accurate beam-rod
   representation is used to capture the spanwise varying displacement of a
   wing with store. The spanwise variation of wing geometry and structural
   properties, as well as the presence of multiple stores on rigid or
   flexible mounts, is efficiently modeled by the primitive-modes approach.
   Aeroelastic limit-cycle oscillation due to structural nonlinearity is
   demonstrated via time-marching simulations, as well as the
   computationally more efficient harmonic-balance method. Some novel forms
   of limit-cycle-oscillation behavior are observed as the model parameters
   are varied, and these are explained in terms of the flutter/divergence
   properties of the base linear aeroelastic system.}},

Title = {{Effect of Anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy on Choroidal
   Thickness in Diabetic Macular Edema}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{158}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{745-751}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To determine the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) therapy on choroidal thickness in eyes with diabetic
   macular edema (DME).
   DESIGN: A retrospective, cohort analysis of 59 eyes from 59 patients
   with DME without prior anti-VEGF therapy.
   METHODS: Choroidal thickness was measured using semiautomated
   segmentation of enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography
   images at 0.5-mm intervals from 2.5 mm nasal to 2.5 mm temporal to the
   fovea. Changes in choroidal thickness with and without anti-VEGF
   treatment over 6 months were compared. Best-corrected visual acuity and
   central foveal thickness were analyzed to evaluate the association of
   choroidal thickness with functional and anatomic outcomes.
   RESULTS: Of the 59 eyes with DME, 26 eyes were observed without
   treatment, whereas 33 underwent intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (mean
   number of injections, 2.73) over 6 months. In untreated eyes, there was
   no significant change in best-corrected visual acuity (P = .098),
   central foveal thickness (P = .472), or choroidal thickness at all
   measurements along the macula (P = .057 at the fovea). In eyes treated
   with anti-VEGF injections, choroidal thickness decreased significantly
   at the fovea (246.6 to 224.8 pm; P < .001) and at 0.5 mm nasal (240.9 to
   221.9 pm; P = .002) and 0.5 mm temporal (249.3 to 224.8 pm; P = .011) to
   the fovea. The decrease in subfoveal choroidal thickness after anti-VEGF
   treatment was not associated with the cumulative number of anti-VEGF
   injections (R-2 = 0.031; P = .327) or to changes in best-corrected
   visual acuity (R-2 = 0.017; P = .470) or central fovea! thickness (R-2 =
   0.040; P = .263).
   CONCLUSIONS: Central choroidal thickness decreases after anti-VEGF
   therapy for DME after 6 months, but may not be associated with
   functional or anatomic outcomes in eyes with DME. (C) 2014 by Elsevier

Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},

Volume = {{383}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{Due to their high water use efficiency, Crassulacean acid metabolism
   (CAM) plants are of environmental and economic importance in the arid
   and semiarid regions of the world. Moreover, many CAM plants (e.g.,
   Agave tequilana) have attractive qualities for biofuel production such
   as a relatively low lignin content and high amount of soluble
   carbohydrates. However, the current estimates of CAM productivity are
   based on empirical stress indices that create large uncertainties. As a
   first step towards a more accurate quantification of CAM productivity,
   this paper introduces a new model that couples both soil and atmosphere
   conditions to CAM photosynthesis.
   The new CAM model is based upon well established C-3 photosynthesis
   models coupled to a nonlinear circadian rhythm oscillator for the
   control of the photosynthesis carbon fluxes. The leaf-level dynamics are
   coupled to a simple, yet realistic description of the
   soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, including a plant water capacitance
   module.
   The resulting model reproduces the four phases of CAM photosynthes is
   and the evolution of their dynamics during a soil moisture drydown, as a
   function of soil type, plant features, and climatic conditions.
   The results help quantify the impact of soil water availability on CAM
   carbon assimilation and transpiration flux.}},

Abstract = {{Research has demonstrated that certain vaginal gel products-microbicides
   containing antiretroviral drugs-may reduce HIV infection risk among
   women. But for vaginal gels to avert HIV and other sexually transmitted
   infections (STIs), at-risk women must be willing to use them as
   directed. These products must therefore be ``acceptable{''} to women and
   an important component of acceptability is users' perception that the
   product will work to prevent infection. We sought to understand how
   women's perceptions of vaginal gel properties may shape their
   understanding of product efficacy for HIV and STI prevention. Sixteen
   women completed two in-depth qualitative interviews (k = 32) to identify
   the range and types of sensory perceptions they experienced when using
   two vaginal gels. We identified emergent themes and linkages between
   users' sensory perceptions and their beliefs about product efficacy.
   Users' predictions about product efficacy for preventing infection
   corresponded to measurable physical properties, including gel volume,
   location in the vagina, coating behavior, sensation of the gel in the
   vagina, leakage, and gel changes during coital acts. Although the women
   described similar sensory experiences (e.g., gel leaked from the
   vagina), they interpreted these experiences to have varying implications
   for product efficacy (e.g., leakage was predicted to increase or
   decrease efficacy). To improve microbicide acceptability, gel developers
   should investigate and deliberately incorporate properties that
   influence users' perceptions of efficacy. When a microbicide is approved
   for use, providers should educate users to anticipate and understand
   their sensory experiences; improving users' experience can maximize
   adherence and product effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{We present a parallel algebraic multigrid (AMG) algorithm for the
   implicit solution of the Darcy problem discretized by the discontinuous
   Galerkin (DG) method that scales optimally for regular and irregular
   meshes. The main idea centers on recasting the preconditioning problem
   so that existing AMG solvers for nodal lower order finite elements can
   be leveraged. This is accomplished by a transformation operator which
   maps the solution from a Lagrange basis representation to a Legendre
   basis representation. While this mapping function must be user supplied,
   we demonstrate how easily it can be constructed for somepopular finite
   element representations includingquadrilateral/hexahedral and
   triangular/tetrahedral DG formulations. Furthermore, we show that the
   mapping does not depend on the Jacobian transformation between reference
   and physical space and so it can be constructed with very limited mesh
   information. Parallel performance studies demonstrate the versatility of
   this approach.}},

Abstract = {{A case study examining aspects of nonstationarity in the estimation of
   flood magnitudes in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic United States is
   presented here. The focus is on challenges posed by changes in the
   number and location of stream gauges over time to assess climate
   variability and land-use land-cover (LULC) change impacts. The study
   shows that statistical outliers are spatially aligned with LULC change
   from urbanization independently of time period and record length across
   the region with substantial increases (>30\%) in the magnitude of the
   25-year and 100-year events since 1950. Large amplification (>10) of the
   ratio of flood magnitude to the mean annual flood was detected in
   expanding urban areas, but only systematically for the 100-year event,
   suggesting that existing infrastructure constrains the sensitivity of
   flood response for events below applied engineering design criteria.
   Overall, annual streamflows do not exhibit statistically significant
   trends (98\% cfl), except for positive trends in urban areas (<7\%), and
   negative trends in regulated rivers and regions of karst processes
   (<12\%). The critical importance of long-term, high-density observing
   networks as the basis to assess and interpret climate change and LULC
   impacts is stressed. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{In articular cartilage, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and
   chondrocyte-associated pericellular matrix (PCM) are characterized by a
   high concentration of proteoglycans (PGs) and their associated
   glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These molecules serve important biochemical,
   structural, and biomechanical roles in the tissue and differences in
   their regional distributions suggest that different GAG/PG species
   contribute to the specific biomechanical properties of the ECM and PCM.
   The objective of this study was to investigate region-specific
   contributions of aggrecan, chondroitin and dermatan sulfate, and
   hyaluronan to the micromechanical properties of articular cartilage PCM
   and ECM in situ. Cryosections of porcine cartilage underwent digestion
   with ADAMTS-4, chondroitinase ABC, bacterial hyaluronidase or human
   leukocyte elastase. Guided by immunofluorescence for type VI collagen,
   AFM stiffness mapping was used to evaluate the elastic properties of
   matched PCM and ECM regions in paired control and digested cartilage
   sections. These methods were used to test the hypotheses that specific
   enzymatic digestion of GAGs or PGs would reduce both PCM and ECM elastic
   moduli. Elastase, which digests a number of PGs, some types of collagen,
   and non-collagenous proteins, was used as a positive control. ECM
   elastic moduli were significantly reduced by all enzyme treatments.
   However, PCM micromechanical properties were unaffected by enzymatic
   digestion of aggrecan, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronan but
   were significantly reduced by 24\% following elastase digestion. Our
   results provide new evidence for high resistance of PCM micromechankal
   properties to PG digestion and suggest a potential role for elastase in
   the degradation of the ECM and PCM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The rare, broadly neutralizing antibodies, 4E10 and 2F5, that target the
   HIV-1 membrane proximal external region also associate with HIV-1
   membrane lipids as part of a required first-step in HIV-1
   neutralization. HIV-1 virions have high concentration of cholesterol and
   sphingomyelin, which are able to organize into liquid-ordered domains
   (i.e., lipid rafts), and could influence the interaction of neutralizing
   antibodies with epitopes proximal to the membrane. The objective of this
   research is to understand how these lipid domains contribute to 2F5/4E10
   membrane interactions and to antigen presentation in liposomal form of
   HIV-1 vaccines. To this end we have engineered biomimetic supported
   lipid bilayers and are able to use atomic force microscopy to visualize
   membrane domains, antigen clustering, and antibody-membrane
   interactions. Our results demonstrate that 2F5/4E10 do not interact with
   highly ordered gel and liquid-ordered domains and exclusively bind to a
   liquid-disordered lipid phase. This suggests that vaccine liposomes that
   contain key viral membrane components, such as high cholesterol content,
   may not be advantageous for 2F5/4E10 vaccine strategies. Rather, vaccine
   liposomes that primarily contain a liquid-disordered phase may be more
   likely to elicit production of lipid reactive, 2F5- and 4E10-like
   antibodies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the fundamental problem of how to design the
   spacing between two plane and parallel tree structures buried in and
   transferring heat to a conducting medium. The Y and T tree-shaped
   structures are configured as two palms facing each other. The search for
   the optimal spacing is pursued in solid domains with three sizes. First,
   we studied a cube where the tree palms structure grow to the second
   level bifurcation. Second and third, we considered a small cube and a
   large cube where the tree structure consists of just the first level
   bifurcation. The results show that the best spacing between palms is
   half of the side of the cube, in order to avoid the interference between
   the two tree and adiabatic boundaries of the cube in which the trees
   structures are embedded. The spacing is possible to optimize, without
   being affected by the shape of the structure, the bifurcation level of
   the structure and the size of cube. The decision of optimal spacing is
   not affected by changes in the volume fraction occupied by tree
   structure in the conducting body. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The total harmonic distortion (THD) of a waveform is a standard way to
   quantify its deviation from a sinusoid. In three-phase systems, we are
   interested in minimizing 3THD: the component of THD produced by odd
   nontriplen harmonics. However, its definition involves an infinite sum,
   making it difficult to evaluate and analyze. This paper solves the
   problem of finding equivalent closed-form expressions for the 3THD of a
   staircase waveform. In particular, two expressions are rigorously
   derived, which reveal 3THD to be a piecewise differentiable function.
   One expression is shorter but describes the pieces implicitly. The other
   is longer but describes the pieces explicitly. We minimize 3THD using
   the closed-form expression and provide a comparison with previous
   techniques. Finally, we provide experimental results that show close
   agreement with the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{In translationally variant (TV) bistatic synthetic aperture radar
   (BSAR), 2-D spatial variation is a major problem to be tackled. In this
   paper, a generalized Omega-K imaging algorithm to deal with this problem
   is proposed. The method utilizes a point target reference spectrum of
   the generalized Loffeld's bistatic formula (LBF) (GLBF). Without the
   bistatic-deformation term, GLBF is the latest development of LBF.
   Similar to the monostatic case, it has a much simpler form than other
   point target reference spectra. Based on the spatial linearization of
   GLBF, the Stolt mapping relationship is derived. Different from the
   traditional Omega-K algorithms for monostatic SAR and translationally
   invariant BSAR, this approach uses a 2-D Stolt frequency transformation.
   Through this transformation, the method can deal with the 2-D spatial
   variation. It can also consider the linear spatial variation of Doppler
   parameters, which is usually not considered in the previous publications
   on bistatic Omega-K algorithms. This method can handle the cases of
   TV-BSAR with different trajectories, different velocities, high squint
   angles, and large bistatic angles. In addition, a compensation method
   for the phase error caused by the linearization is discussed. Numerical
   simulations and experimental data processing verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed method.}},

   Perfusion Capacity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury (SCI) can induce prolonged spinal cord compression
   that may result in a reduction of local tissue perfusion, progressive
   ischemia, and potentially irreversible tissue necrosis. Due to the
   combination of risk factors and the varied presentation of symptoms, the
   appropriate method and time course for clinical intervention following
   SCI are not always evident. In this study, a three-dimensional finite
   element fluid-structure interaction model of the cervical spinal cord
   was developed to examine how traditionally sub-clinical compressive
   mechanical loads impact spinal arterial blood flow. The spinal cord and
   surrounding dura mater were modeled as linear elastic, isotropic, and
   incompressible solids, while blood was modeled as a single-phased,
   incompressible Newtonian fluid. Simulation results indicate that
   anterior, posterior, and anteroposterior compressions of the cervical
   spinal cord have significantly different ischemic potentials, with
   prediction that the posterior component of loading elevates patient risk
   due to the concomitant reduction of blood flow in the arterial branches.
   Conversely, anterior loading compromises flow through the anterior
   spinal artery but minimally impacts branch flow rates. The findings of
   this study provide novel insight into how sub-clinical spinal cord
   compression could give rise to certain disease states, and suggest a
   need to monitor spinal artery perfusion following even mild compressive
   loading.}},

   extensively for drug delivery in a variety of different embodiments-as
   soluble macromolecular carriers, self-assembled nanoparticles,

Abstract = {{Increased flow resistance is responsible for the elevated intraocular
   pressure characteristic of glaucoma, but the cause of this resistance
   increase is not known. We tested the hypothesis that altered
   biomechanical behavior of Schlemm's canal (SC) cells contributes to this
   dysfunction. We used atomic force microscopy, optical magnetic twisting
   cytometry, and a unique cell perfusion apparatus to examine cultured
   endothelial cells isolated from the inner wall of SC of healthy and
   glaucomatous human eyes. Here we establish the existence of a reduced
   tendency for pore formation in the glaucomatous SC cell-likely
   accounting for increased outflow resistance-that positively correlates
   with elevated subcortical cell stiffness, along with an enhanced
   sensitivity to the mechanical microenvironment including altered
   expression of several key genes, particularly connective tissue growth
   factor. Rather than being seen as a simple mechanical barrier to
   filtration, the endothelium of SC is seen instead as a dynamic material
   whose response to mechanical strain leads to pore formation and thereby
   modulates the resistance to aqueous humor outflow. In the glaucomatous
   eye, this process becomes impaired. Together, these observations support
   the idea of SC cell stiffness-and its biomechanical effects on pore
   formation-as a therapeutic target in glaucoma.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray scattering has played a key role in non-destructive materials
   characterization due to the material-specific coherent scattering
   signatures. In the current energy dispersive coherent scatter imaging
   systems, including selected volume tomography and coherent scatter
   computed tomography, each object voxel is measured at a single scatter
   angle, which suffers from slow acquisition time. The employment of coded
   apertures in x-ray scatter imaging systems improves the photon
   collection efficiency, making it promising for real time volumetric
   imaging and material identification. In this paper, we propose a
   volumetric x-ray scatter imaging system using a pair of complementary
   coded apertures: a coded aperture on the detector side introduces
   multiplexed measurement on an energy-sensitive detector array; a
   complementary source-side coded aperture selectively illuminates the
   object to decouple the ambiguity due to the increased parallelization
   for 4D imaging. The system yields the 1D coherent scattering form factor
   at each voxel in 3D. We demonstrate tomographic imaging and material
   identification with the system and achieve a spatial resolution similar
   to 1 cm and a normalized momentum transfer resolution, Delta q/q, of
   0.2. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This is a treatment of the phenomenon of energy storage by melting in an
   enclosure where the heating is provided by an invading line of higher
   temperature. We show that the melting process consists of two phases:
   ``invasion{''} thermal diffusion along the invading line, which is
   followed by ``consolidation{''} as heat diffuses perpendicularly to the
   invading line. We report the duration of both phases and the evolution
   of the melt layer around the invading line during the two-dimensional
   and three-dimensional invasion. The amount of melted material increases
   in time according to a curve shaped as an S. Diffusion sweeps the
   territory faster as the complexity of the tree design increases meaning
   the S-curve of the history of the process becomes steeper. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{The role of root water uptake in regulating soil water saturation in
   salt marshes is controversial. Modeling studies suggest that soil
   aeration is improved by transpiration, with implications for the
   distribution of vegetation species and of the associated topographic
   features controlling the hydraulic regime of the marshland and
   eventually its survival. Marsh vegetation plays a key role in the
   preservation of such critical environment, which represents unique
   marker for climatic change and impact studies. However, the direct
   quantification of space-time aeration patterns has remained elusive, in
   part, because of the limitations posed by high salinity to conventional
   observation techniques such as time or frequency domain reflectometry.
   Here we show that time-lapse microscale electrical resistivity
   tomography, coupled with tensiometric observations, allows the
   identification of variably saturated zones and the characterization of
   space-time soil moisture dynamics in a salt marsh in the Venice Lagoon
   (Italy). This is the first quantitative observational experiment which
   confirms that periodically flooded plants are capable of producing a
   persistently aerated layer below the flooded surface when transpiration
   proceeds at a sufficiently high rate. The experimental results are
   compared against previously published model predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Although xenon is classically taught to be a ``perfusion-limited{''}
   gas, Xe-129 in its hyperpolarized (HP) form, when detected by magnetic
   resonance (MR), can probe diffusion limitation. Inhaled HP Xe-129
   diffuses across the pulmonary blood-gas barrier, and, depending on its
   tissue environment, shifts its resonant frequency relative to the
   gas-phase reference (0 ppm) by 198 ppm in tissue/plasma barrier and 217
   ppm in red blood cells (RBCs). In this work, we hypothesized that in
   patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the ratio of Xe-129
   spectroscopic signal in the RBCs vs. barrier would diminish as
   diffusion-limitation delayed replenishment of Xe-129 magnetization in
   RBCs. To test this hypothesis, Xe-129 spectra were acquired in 6 IPF
   subjects as well as 11 healthy volunteers to establish a normal range.
   The RBC:barrier ratio was 0.55 +/- 0.13 in healthy volunteers but was
   3.3-fold lower in IPF subjects (0.16 +/- 0.03, P = 0.0002). This was
   caused by a 52\% reduction in the RBC signal (P = 0.02) and a 58\%
   increase in the barrier signal (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the RBC:barrier
   ratio strongly correlated with lung diffusing capacity for carbon
   monoxide (DLCO) (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001). It exhibited a moderate
   interscan variability (8.25\%), and in healthy volunteers it decreased
   with greater lung inflation (r = -0.78, P = 0.005). This spectroscopic
   technique provides a noninvasive, global probe of diffusion limitation
   and gas-transfer impairment and forms the basis for developing 3D MR
   imaging of gas exchange.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of X-ray scatter patterns has been demonstrated as an
   effective method of identifying specific materials in mixed object
   environments, for both biological and non-biological applications. Here
   we describe an X-ray scatter imaging system for material identification
   in cluttered objects and investigate its performance using a large-scale
   Monte Carlo simulation study of one-thousand objects containing a broad
   array of materials. The GEANT4 Monte Carlo source code for Rayleigh
   scatter physics was modified to model coherent scatter diffraction in
   bulk materials based on experimentally measured form factors for 33
   materials. The simulation was then used to model coherent scatter
   signals from a variety of targets and clutter (background) materials in
   one thousand randomized objects.
   The resulting scatter images were used to characterize four parameters
   of the imaging system that affected its ability to identify target
   materials: (a) the arrangement of materials in the object, (b) clutter
   attenuation, (c) type of target material, and (d) the X-ray tube
   current. We found that the positioning of target materials within the
   object did not significantly affect their detectability; however, a
   strong negative correlation was observed between the target
   detectability and the clutter attenuation of the object. The imaging
   signal was also found to be relatively invariant to increases in X-ray
   tube current above I mAs for most materials considered in the study.
   This work is the first Monte Carlo study to our knowledge of a large
   population of cluttered object of an X-ray scatter imaging system for
   material identification and lays the foundation for large-scale studies
   of the effectiveness of X-ray scatter imaging systems for material
   identification in complex samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The paper regards the complex dynamical network (CDN) as a static
   network with temporal characteristics so as to consider its dynamic
   behavior. The influence factor and dynamics laws in CDN are explored by
   using the methods of simulation and statistical physics. It is found
   that both the dynamic behavior of the nodes and the number of initial
   disturbed nodes can accelerate the failure propagation and enlarge the
   influence scope. There is a phase transformation point of the repair
   ratio with the increase of repair time tau for the homogeneous network
   (the value of tau for all the nodes is the same). Beyond the threshold,
   the entire network will collapse; otherwise, the network can be back to
   normal after a period of time. There is an inflection point of the
   repair rate with the simulation step and the recovery rate in
   heterogeneous network is much slower than that in homogeneous network.
   The results can provide technical support for the fault management and
   network optimization in CDN which will promote the development of
   corresponding theory in CDN.}},

Abstract = {{We assess the performance of a group of exchange-correlation functionals
   for predicting the secondary structure of peptide chains, up to a new
   many-body dispersion corrected hybrid density functional, dubbed
   PBE0+MBD{*} by its original authors. For the purpose of validation, we
   first compare to published, high-level benchmark conformational energy
   hierarchies (coupled cluster at the singles, doubles, and perturbative
   triples level, CCSD(T)) for 73 conformers of small three-residue
   peptides, establishing that the van der Wash corrected PBE0 functional
   yields an average error of only similar to 20 meV (similar to 0.5
   kcal/mol). This compares to similar to 40-50 meV for non-dispersion
   corrected PBE0 and 40-100 meV for different empirical force fields
   (estimated for the alanine tetrapeptide). For longer peptide chains that
   form a secondary structure, CCSD(T) level benchmark data are currently
   unaffordable. We thus turn to the experimentally well studied
   Ac-Phe-Ala(5)-LysH(+) peptide, for which four closely competing
   conformers were established by infrared spectroscopy. For comparison, an
   exhaustive theoretical conformational space exploration yields at least
   11 competing low energy minima. We show that (i) the many-body
   dispersion correction, (ii) the hybrid functional nature of PBE0+MBD{*},
   and (iii) zero-point corrections are needed to reveal the four
   experimentally observed structures as the minima that would be populated
   at low temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular processes are noisy due to the stochastic nature of biochemical
   reactions. As such, it is impossible to predict the exact quantity of a
   molecule or other attributes at the single-cell level. However, the
   distribution of a molecule over a population is often deterministic and
   is governed by the underlying regulatory networks relevant to the
   cellular functionality of interest. Recent studies have started to
   exploit this property to infer network states. To facilitate the
   analysis of distributional data in a general experimental setting, we
   introduce a computational framework to efficiently characterize the
   sensitivity of distributional output to changes in external stimuli.
   Further, we establish a probability-divergence-based kernel regression
   model to accurately infer signal level based on distribution
   measurements. Our methodology is applicable to any biological system
   subject to stochastic dynamics and can be used to elucidate how
   population-based information processing may contribute to organism-level
   functionality. It also lays the foundation for engineering synthetic
   biological systems that exploit population decoding to more robustly
   perform various biocomputation tasks, such as disease diagnostics and
   environmental-pollutant sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture stabilization in the diabetic patient is associated with higher
   complication rates, particularly infection and impaired wound healing,
   which can lead to major tissue damage, osteomyelitis, and higher
   amputation rates. With an increasing prevalence of diabetes and an aging
   population, the risks of infection of internal fixation devices are
   expected to grow. Although numerous retrospective clinical studies have
   identified a relationship between diabetes and infection, currently
   there are few animal models that have been used to investigate
   postoperative surgical-site infections associated with internal fixator
   implantation and diabetes. The authors therefore refined the protocol
   for inducing hyperglycemia and compared the bacterial burden in controls
   to pharmacologically induced type 1 diabetic rats after undergoing
   internal fracture plate fixation and Staphylococcus aureus surgical-site
   inoculation. Using an initial series of streptozotocin doses, followed
   by optional additional doses to reach a target blood glucose range of
   300 to 600 mg/dl, the authors reliably induced diabetes in 100 percent
   of the rats (n = 16), in which a narrow hyperglycemic range was
   maintained 14 days after onset of diabetes (mean +/- SEM, 466 +/- 16
   mg/dl; coefficient of variation, 0.15). With respect to their primary
   end-point, the authors quantified a significantly higher infectious
   burden in inoculated diabetic animals (median, 3.2 x 10(10)
   colony-forming units/mg dry tissue) compared with inoculated nondiabetic
   animals (7.2 x 10(4) colony-forming units/mg dry tissue). These data
   support the authors' hypothesis that uncontrolled diabetes adversely
   affects the immune system's ability to clear Staphylococcus aureus
   associated with internal hardware.}},

Abstract = {{2.5-D integration is emerging as the precursor to stacked 3-D ICs. Since
   the silicon interposer and micro-bumps in 2.5-D integration can suffer
   from fabrication and assembly defects, post-bond testing is necessary
   for product qualification. This paper proposes and evaluates an
   interposer test architecture based on extensions to the IEEE 1149.1
   standard. The proposed method enables access to interconnects inside the
   interposer by probing on the C4 bumps. It provides an effective test
   method for opens, shorts, and interconnect delay defects in the
   interposer. Moreover, micro-bumps can be tested through test paths that
   include dies on the interposer. The proposed test technique is fully
   compatible with the IEEE 1149.1 architecture and can be controlled by
   the test-access port controller. We present HSPICE and ModelSim
   simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of fault detection.
   Simulation results show that a large range of defects can be detected,
   diagnosed, and characterized using the proposed approach. We also
   present synthesis results to evaluate the hardware cost per die relative
   to the IEEE 1149.1 standard. Synthesis results show that the cost of
   implementation of the architecture is negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips are recently being advocated for
   fast on-chip implementation of biochemical laboratory assays or
   protocols, and several algorithms for diluting and mixing of reagents
   have been reported. However, all methods for such automatic sample
   preparation suffer from a drawback that they assume the availability of
   input fluids in pure form, that is, each with an extreme concentration
   factor (CF) of 100\%. In many real-life scenarios, the stock solutions
   consist of samples/reagents with multiple CFs. No algorithm is yet known
   for preparing a target mixture of fluids with a given ratio when its
   constituents are supplied with random concentrations. An intriguing
   question is whether or not a given target ratio is feasible to produce
   from such a general input condition. In this article, we first study the
   feasibility properties for the generalized mixing problem under the (1 :
   1) mix-split model with an allowable error in the target CFs not
   exceeding 1/2(d), where the integer d is user specified and denotes the
   desired accuracy level of CF. Next, an algorithm is proposed which
   produces the desired target ratio of N reagents in O(Nd) mix-split
   steps, where N (>= 3) denotes the number of constituent fluids in the
   mixture. The feasibility analysis also leads to the characterization of
   the total space of input stock solutions from which a given target
   mixture can be derived, and conversely, the space of all target ratios,
   which are derivable from a given set of input reagents with arbitrary
   CFs. Finally, we present a generalized algorithm for diluting a sample S
   in minimum (1 : 1) mix-split steps when two or more arbitrary
   concentrations of S (diluted with the same buffer) are supplied as
   inputs. These results settle several open questions in droplet-based
   algorithmic microfluidics and offer efficient solutions for a wider
   class of on-chip sample preparation problems.}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle is a major target for tissue engineering, given its
   relative size in the body, fraction of cardiac output that passes
   through muscle beds, as well as its key role in energy metabolism and
   diabetes, and the need for therapies for muscle diseases such as
   muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia. To date, most studies with
   tissue-engineered skeletal muscle have utilized murine and rat cell
   sources. On the other hand, successful engineering of functional human
   muscle would enable different applications including improved methods
   for preclinical testing of drugs and therapies. Some of the requirements
   for engineering functional skeletal muscle include expression of adult
   forms of muscle proteins, comparable contractile forces to those
   produced by native muscle, and physiological force-length and
   force-frequency relations. This review discusses the various strategies
   and challenges associated with these requirements, specific applications
   with cultured human myoblasts, and future directions.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{A body of evidence has shown that the control of E2F transcription
   factor activity is critical for determining cell cycle entry and cell
   proliferation. However, an understanding of the precise determinants of
   this control, including the role of other cell-cycle regulatory
   activities, has not been clearly defined. Here, recognizing that the
   contributions of individual regulatory components could be masked by
   heterogeneity in populations of cells, we model the potential roles of
   individual components together with the use of an integrated system to
   follow E2F dynamics at the single-cell level and in real time. These
   analyses reveal that crossing a threshold amplitude of E2F accumulation
   determines cell cycle commitment. Importantly, we find that Myc is
   critical in modulating the amplitude, whereas cyclin D/E activities have
   little effect on amplitude but do contribute to the modulation of
   duration of E2F activation, thereby affecting the pace of cell cycle
   progression.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cephalopods can display dazzling patterns of colours by selectively
   contracting muscles to reversibly activate chromatophores -
   pigment-containing cells under their skins. Inspired by this novel
   colouring strategy found in nature, we design an
   electro-mechano-chemically responsive elastomer system that can exhibit
   a wide variety of fluorescent patterns under the control of electric
   fields. We covalently couple a stretchable elastomer with mechanochromic
   molecules, which emit strong fluorescent signals if sufficiently
   deformed. We then use electric fields to induce various patterns of
   large deformation on the elastomer surface, which displays versatile
   fluorescent patterns including lines, circles and letters on demand.
   Theoretical models are further constructed to predict the electrically
   induced fluorescent patterns and to guide the design of this class of
   elastomers and devices. The material and method open promising avenues
   for creating flexible devices in soft/wet environments that combine
   deformation, colorimetric and fluorescent response with topological and
   chemical changes in response to a single remote signal.}},

Abstract = {{Chitin occurs in a variety of invertebrates, especially in arthropod
   cuticles, but is rarely reported in the fossil record. Although it has
   been detected in fossils as old as Middle Cambrian and Silurian, the
   majority of records come from much younger, Cenozoic deposits. In this
   paper, we report the preservation of chitin in Early Jurassic
   neritimorph gastropod egg capsules deposited in bivalve shells from
   prodelta-deltafront and nearshore paleoenvironments of the Holy Cross
   Mountains, Poland. We used a number of analytical methods to confirm the
   presence of chitin preserved in these ancient fossils. This is the first
   record of chitin preservation in Mesozoic deposits that, interestingly,
   do not follow the conventional Konservat-Lagerstatten manner of
   preserving soft-bodied and non-biomineralized organisms. We believe that
   deltaic settings characterized by episodic, high input of fluvial
   deposits, oligohaline conditions, and oxygen-poor microenvironment
   within the sediment-as well as early cementation of sediment infilling
   the shells-were crucial for chitin preservation. The preservation of
   chitin in such recalcitrant structures as egg capsules and deposits that
   formed outside conventional Konservat-Lagerstatten conditions renders it
   likely similar deposits may yield promise for discoveries of similar
   biological macromolecules.}},

Abstract = {{Volumetric segmentation of subcortical structures, such as the basal
   ganglia and thalamus, is necessary for noninvasive diagnosis and
   neurosurgery planning. This is a challenging problem due in part to
   limited boundary information between structures, similar intensity
   profiles across the different structures, and low contrast data. This
   paper presents a semiautomatic segmentation system exploiting the
   superior image quality of ultrahigh field (7 T) MRI. The proposed
   approach utilizes the complementary edge information in the multiple
   structural MRI modalities. It combines optimally selected two modalities
   from susceptibility-weighted, T-2-weighted, and diffusion MRI, and
   introduces a tailored new edge indicator function. In addition to this,
   we employ prior shape and configuration knowledge of the subcortical
   structures in order to guide the evolution of geometric active surfaces.
   Neighboring structures are segmented iteratively, constraining
   oversegmentation at their borders with a nonoverlapping penalty. Several
   experiments with data acquired on a 7 T MRI scanner demonstrate the
   feasibility and power of the approach for the segmentation of basal
   ganglia components critical for neurosurgery applications such as deep
   brain stimulation surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The radiation dose involved in any medical imaging modality that uses
   ionizing radiation needs to be well understood by the medical physics
   and clinical community. This is especially true of screening modalities.
   Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has recently been introduced into the

   population. Therefore, it is important that the medical physics
   community have the required information to be able to understand,
   estimate, and communicate the radiation dose levels involved in breast
   tomosynthesis imaging. For this purpose, the American Association of
   Physicists in Medicine Task Group 223 on Dosimetry in Tomosynthesis
   Imaging has prepared this report that discusses dosimetry in breast
   imaging in general, and describes a methodology and provides the data
   necessary to estimate mean breast glandular dose from a tomosynthesis
   acquisition. In an effort to maximize familiarity with the procedures
   and data provided in this Report, the methodology to perform the dose

Title = {{Quantum noise properties of CT images with anatomical textured
   backgrounds across reconstruction algorithms: FBP and SAFIRE}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Quantum noise properties of CT images are generally assessed
   using simple geometric phantoms with uniform backgrounds. Such phantoms
   may be inadequate when assessing nonlinear reconstruction or
   postprocessing algorithms. The purpose of this study was to design
   anatomically informed textured phantoms and use the phantoms to assess
   quantum noise properties across two clinically available reconstruction
   algorithms, filtered back projection (FBP) and sinogram affirmed
   iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE).
   Methods: Two phantoms were designed to represent lung and soft-tissue
   textures. The lung phantom included intricate vessel-like structures
   along with embedded nodules (spherical, lobulated, and spiculated). The
   soft tissue phantom was designed based on a three-dimensional clustered
   lumpy background with included low-contrast lesions (spherical and
   anthropomorphic). The phantoms were built using rapid prototyping (3D
   printing) technology and, along with a uniform phantom of similar size,
   were imaged on a Siemens SOMATOM Definition Flash CT scanner and
   reconstructed with FBP and SAFIRE. Fifty repeated acquisitions were
   acquired for each background type and noise was assessed by estimating
   pixel-value statistics, such as standard deviation (i.e., noise
   magnitude), autocorrelation, and noise power spectrum. Noise
   stationarity was also assessed by examining the spatial distribution of
   noise magnitude. The noise properties were compared across background
   types and between the two reconstruction algorithms.
   Results: In FBP and SAFIRE images, noise was globally nonstationary for
   all phantoms. In FBP images of all phantoms, and in SAFIRE images of the
   uniform phantom, noise appeared to be locally stationary (within a
   reasonably small region of interest). Noise was locally nonstationary in
   SAFIRE images of the textured phantoms with edge pixels showing higher
   noise magnitude compared to pixels in more homogenous regions. For
   pixels in uniform regions, noise magnitude was reduced by an average of
   60\% in SAFIRE images compared to FBP. However, for edge pixels, noise
   magnitude ranged from 20\% higher to 40\% lower in SAFIRE images
   compared to FBP. SAFIRE images of the lung phantom exhibited distinct
   regions with varying noise texture (i. e., noise autocorrelation/power
   spectra).
   Conclusions: Quantum noise properties observed in uniform phantoms may
   not be representative of those in actual patients for nonlinear
   reconstruction algorithms. Anatomical texture should be considered when
   evaluating the performance of CT systems that use such nonlinear
   algorithms. c 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Title = {{Using computer-extracted image features for modeling of error-making
   patterns in detection of mammographic masses among radiology residents}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Mammography is the most widely accepted and utilized screening
   modality for early breast cancer detection. Providing high quality
   mammography education to radiology trainees is essential, since
   excellent interpretation skills are needed to ensure the highest benefit
   of screening mammography for patients. The authors have previously
   proposed a computer-aided education system based on trainee models.
   Those models relate human-assessed image characteristics to trainee
   error. In this study, the authors propose to build trainee models that
   utilize features automatically extracted from images using computer
   vision algorithms to predict likelihood of missing each mass by the
   trainee. This computer vision-based approach to trainee modeling will
   allow for automatically searching large databases of mammograms in order
   to identify challenging cases for each trainee.
   Methods: The authors' algorithm for predicting the likelihood of missing
   a mass consists of three steps. First, a mammogram is segmented into
   air, pectoral muscle, fatty tissue, dense tissue, and mass using
   automated segmentation algorithms. Second, 43 features are extracted
   using computer vision algorithms for each abnormality identified by
   experts. Third, error-making models (classifiers) are applied to predict
   the likelihood of trainees missing the abnormality based on the
   extracted features. The models are developed individually for each
   trainee using his/her previous reading data. The authors evaluated the
   predictive performance of the proposed algorithm using data from a
   reader study in which 10 subjects (7 residents and 3 novices) and 3
   experts read 100 mammographic cases. Receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) methodology was applied for the evaluation.
   Results: The average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the error-making
   models for the task of predicting which masses will be detected and
   which will be missed was 0.607 (95\% CI, 0.564-0.650). This value was
   statistically significantly different from 0.5 (p < 0.0001). For the 7
   residents only, the AUC performance of the models was 0.590 (95\% CI,
   0.537-0.642) and was also significantly higher than 0.5 (p = 0.0009).
   Therefore, generally the authors' models were able to predict which
   masses were detected and which were missed better than chance.
   Conclusions: The authors proposed an algorithm that was able to predict
   which masses will be detected and which will be missed by each
   individual trainee. This confirms existence of error-making patterns in
   the detection of masses among radiology trainees. Furthermore, the
   proposed methodology will allow for the optimized selection of difficult
   cases for the trainees in an automatic and efficient manner. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Since the discovery of materials with negative refractive index, widely
   known as metamaterials, it has been possible to develop new devices that
   utilize a metamaterial's ability to control the path of electromagnetic
   energy. Of particular promise, and already under intensive development
   for commercial applications, are metamaterial antennas for satellite
   communications. Using reconfigurable metamaterials in conjunction with
   the principles of holography, these new antennas can electronically
   steer the high gain antenna beam required for broadband communications
   while not having any moving parts, being thinner, lighter weight, and
   less expensive, and requiring less power to operate than conventional
   alternatives. Yet, the promise of these devices will not be realized
   without efficient and effective control and optimization. Toward this
   end, in this paper a discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) model of a
   waveguide-fed planar metamaterial antenna is derived. The proposed model
   is demonstrated to accurately predict the radiation of a two-dimensional
   metamaterial at a much reduced computational cost to full-wave
   simulation and at much greater fidelity than simpler models typically
   used in the field. The predictive capabilities of the derived DDA model
   opens possibilities for model-based control design for optimal beam
   steering. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Scanning laser ophthalmoscopes (SLOs) are able to achieve superior
   contrast and axial sectioning capability compared to fundus photography.
   However, SLOs typically use monochromatic illumination and are thus
   unable to extract color information of the retina. Previous color SLO
   imaging techniques utilized multiple lasers or narrow band sources for
   illumination, which allowed for multiple color but not ``true color{''}
   imaging as done in fundus photography. We describe the first ``true
   color{''} SLO, handheld color SLO, and combined color SLO integrated
   with a spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. To
   achieve accurate color imaging, the SLO was calibrated with a color test
   target and utilized an achromatizing lens when imaging the retina to
   correct for the eye's longitudinal chromatic aberration. Color SLO and
   OCT images from volunteers were then acquired simultaneously with a
   combined power under the ANSI limit. Images from this system were then
   compared with those from commercially available SLOs featuring multiple
   narrow-band color imaging. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{xWe study the effect of the length scales alpha and beta on the
   performance of the Navier Stokes-alpha beta equations for numerical
   simulations of turbulence over coarse discretizations. To this end, we
   rely on the strained spiral vortex model and take advantage of the
   dimensional reduction allowed by that model. In particular, the
   three-dimensional energy spectrum is reformulated so that it can be
   calculated from solutions of the two-dimensional unstrained Navier
   Stokes-alpha beta equations. A similarity theory for the spiral vortex
   model shows that the Navier Stokes-alpha beta model is better equipped
   than the Navier Stokes-a model to capture smaller-scale behavior.
   Numerical experiments performed using a pseudo-spectral discretization
   along with the second-order Adams Bashforth time-stepping algorithm
   yield results indicating that the fidelity of the energy spectrum in
   both the inertial and dissipation ranges is significantly improved for
   beta < alpha.}},

   significant improvement in image resolution and adjacent sources
   detectability when the inverse source solver is applied. Because of the
   improvements, the inverse source solver reduces the sensitivity on scan

Abstract = {{The nucleus basalis (NB) is a cholinergic neuromodulatory structure that
   projects liberally to the entire cortical mantle and regulates
   information processing in all cortical layers. Here, we recorded
   activity from populations of single units in the NB as rats performed a
   whisker-dependent tactile discrimination task. Over 80\% of neurons
   responded with significant modulation in at least one phase of the task.
   Such activity started before stimulus onset and continued for seconds
   after reward delivery. Firing rates monotonically increased with reward
   magnitude during the task, suggesting that NB neurons are not indicating
   the absolute deviation from expected reward amounts. Individual neurons
   also encoded significant amounts of information about stimulus identity.
   Such robust coding was not present when the same stimuli were delivered
   to lightly anesthetized animals, suggesting that the NB neurons contain
   a sensorimotor, rather than purely sensory or motor, representation of
   the environment. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that
   neurons in the NB provide a value-laden representation of the
   sensorimotor state of the animal as it engages in significant behavioral

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate effects of prematurity on early optic nerve (ON)
   development and the usefulness of ON parameters as indicators of central
   nervous system (CNS) development and pathology.
   Design: Prospective, cross-sectional, longitudinal study.
   Participants: Forty-four preterm infants undergoing retinopathy of
   prematurity (ROP) screening and 52 term infants.
   Methods: We analyzed ON from portable handheld spectral-domain optical
   coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images (Bioptigen, Inc, Research Triangle
   Park, NC) of 44 preterm and 52 term infants. The highest-quality ON scan
   from either eye was selected for quantitative analysis. Longitudinal
   analysis was performed at 31-36 weeks and 37-42 weeks postmenstrual age
   (PMA). Preterm ON parameters also were assessed for correlation with
   indicators of cognitive, language, and motor development and CNS
   pathology.
   Main Outcome Measures: Vertical cup diameter (vCD), vertical disc
   diameter (vDD), vertical cup-to-disc ratio (vCDR), cup depth, and
   indicators of neurocognitive development and CNS pathology.
   Results: At 37-42 weeks PMA, preterm infants had larger vCD and vCDR
   than term infants (908 vs. 700 mu m {[}P<0.001] and 0.68 vs. 0.53 mu m
   {[}P<0.001], respectively), whereas cup depth and vDD were not
   significantly different. Longitudinal changes (n = 26 preterm eyes; mean
   interval, 4.7 weeks) in vDD and in vCDR were an increase of 74 mu m(P =
   0.008) and decrease of 0.05 (P = 0.015), respectively. In preterm
   infants (n = 44), periventricular leukomalacia was associated with
   larger vCD (1084 vs. 828 mu m; P = 0.005) and vCDR (0.85 vs. 0.63;
   P<0.001), posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus was associated with shallower
   cup (331 vs. 456 mu m; P = 0.030), and clinical magnetic resonance
   imaging was associated with larger vCDR (0.73 vs. 0.64; P = 0.023). In
   23 preterm infants with Bayley Scales of Infant Development scores,
   larger vCDR was associated with lower cognitive scores (P = 0.049).
   Conclusions: This is the first analysis of ON parameters in premature
   infants using SD-OCT. It demonstrated that by age of term birth, vCD and
   vCDR are larger in preterm infants who were screened for ROP than in
   term infants. In this prospective pilot study, ON parameters in these
   preterm infants associate weakly with CNS pathology and future cognitive
   development. Future prospective studies with larger numbers are
   necessary before further conclusions can be made. (C) 2014 by the

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},

Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{16-22}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of roots in the soil is of central importance
   to the mass and energy exchange between the land and the atmosphere. It
   has been demonstrated that the vertical root profiles which maximize
   transpiration in numerical experiments reflect well the characteristics
   of root profiles observed in nature for water-limited ecosystems.
   Previous research has demonstrated how the optimal vertical root profile
   depends on both the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and the soil
   texture. Recently, in the climate literature, it has been suggested Chou
   et al. (2012) {[}5] that increased greenhouse forcing in the tropics can
   lead to a simultaneous decrease in the frequency and increase in the
   intensity of precipitation. In this paper we demonstrate how such a
   change in the statistical structure of rainfall, even with no change to
   MAP, requires deeper root distributions to maintain optimal water use.
   These results raise interesting questions for future studies of nutrient
   dynamics, the cost of additional below ground carbon allocation, and
   inter plant functional type competition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The goal of drug delivery is to improve the safety and therapeutic
   efficacy of drugs. This review focuses on delivery platforms that are
   either derived from endogenous pathways, long-circulating biomolecules
   and cells or that piggyback onto long-circulating biomolecules and
   cells. The first class of such platforms is protein-based delivery
   systems-albumin, transferrin, and fusion to the Fc domain of
   antibodies-that have a long-circulation half-life and are designed to
   transport different molecules. The second class is lipid-based delivery
   systems-lipoproteins and exosomes-that are naturally occurring
   circulating lipid particles. The third class is cell-based delivery
   systems-erythrocytes, macrophages, and platelets-that have evolved, for
   reasons central to their function, to exhibit a long life-time in the
   body. The last class is small molecule-based delivery systems that
   include folic acid. This article reviews the biology of these systems,
   their application in drug delivery, and the promises and limitations of

Abstract = {{A new shrinkage-based construction is developed for a compressible
   vector x is an element of R-n for cases in which the components of x are
   naturally associated with a tree structure. Important examples are when
   x corresponds to the coefficients of a wavelet or block-DCT
   representation of data. The method we consider in detail, and for which
   numerical results are presented, is based on the gamma distribution. The
   gamma distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution that is infinitely
   divisible, and these characteristics are leveraged within the model. We
   further demonstrate that the general framework is appropriate for many
   other types of infinitely divisible heavy-tailed distributions. Bayesian
   inference is carried out by approximating the posterior with samples
   from an MCMC algorithm, as well as by constructing a variational
   approximation to the posterior. We also consider
   expectation-maximization (EM) for a MAP (point) solution.

Title = {{Molecular characterization of chordoma xenografts generated from a novel

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Object. Chordoma cells can generate solid-like tumors in xenograft
   models that express some molecular characteristics of the parent tumor,
   including positivity for brachyury and cytokeratins. However, there is a
   dearth of molecular markers that relate to chordoma tumor growth, as
   well as the cell lines needed to advance treatment. The objective in
   this study was to isolate a novel primary chordoma cell source and
   analyze the characteristics of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model
   for comparison with the established U-CH1 and U-CH2b cell lines.
   Methods. Primary cells from a sacral chordoma, called ``DVC-4,{''} were
   cultured alongside U-CH1 and U-CH2b cells for more than 20 passages and
   characterized for expression of CD24 and brachyury. While brachyury is
   believed essential for driving tumor formation, CD24 is associated with
   healthy nucleus pulposus cells. Each cell type was subcutaneously
   implanted in NOD/SCID/IL2R gamma(null) mice. The percentage of solid
   tumors formed, time to maximum tumor size, and immunostaining scores for
   CD24 and brachyury (intensity scores of 0-3, heterogeneity scores of
   0-1) were reported and evaluated to test differences across groups.
   Results. The DVC-4 cells retained chordoma-like morphology in culture
   and exhibited CD24 and brachyury expression profiles in vitro that were
   similar to those for U-CH1 and U-CH2b. Both U-CH1 and DVC-4 cells grew
   tumors at rates that were faster than those for U-CH2b cells. Gross
   tumor developed at nearly every site (95\%) injected with U-CH1 and at
   most sites (75\%) injected with DVC-4. In contrast, U-CH2b cells
   produced grossly visible tumors in less than 50\% of injected sites.
   Brachyury staining was similar among tumors derived from all 3 cell
   types and was intensely positive (scores of 2-3) in a majority of tissue
   sections. In contrast, differences in the pattern and intensity of
   staining for CD24 were noted among the 3 types of cell-derived tumors (p
   < 0.05, chi-square test), with evidence of intense and uniform staining
   in a majority of U-CH1,tumor sections (score of 3) and more than half of
   the DVC-4 tumor sections (scores of 2-3). In contrast, a majority of
   sections from U-CH2b cells stained modestly for CD24 (scores of 1-2)
   with a predominantly heterogeneous staining pattern.
   Conclusions. This is the first report on xenografts generated from
   U-CH2b cells in which a low tumorigenicity was discovered despite
   evidence of chordoma-like characteristics in vitro. For tumors derived
   from a primary chordoma cell and U-CH1 cell line, similarly intense
   staining for CD24 was observed, which may correspond to their similar
   potential to grow tumors. In contrast, U-CH2b tumors stained less
   intensely for CD24. These results emphasize that many markers, including
   CD24, may be useful in distinguishing among chordoma cell types and
   their tumorigenicity in vivo.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the identification of heterogeneous linear elastic
   moduli in the context of frequency-domain, coupled acoustic-structure
   interaction (ASI), using either solid displacement or fluid pressure
   measurement data. The approach postulates the inverse problem as an
   optimization problem where the solution is obtained by minimizing a
   modified error in constitutive equation (MECE) functional. The latter
   measures the discrepancy in the constitutive equations that connect
   kinematically admissible strains and dynamically admissible stresses,
   while incorporating the measurement data as additional quadratic error
   terms. We demonstrate two strategies for selecting the MECE weighting
   coefficient to produce regularized solutions to the ill-posed
   identification problem: 1) the discrepancy principle of Morozov, and 2)
   an error-balance approach that selects the weight parameter as the
   minimizer of another functional involving the ECE and the data misfit.
   Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can
   successfully recover elastic parameters in 2D and 3D ASI systems from
   response measurements taken in either the solid or fluid subdomains.
   Furthermore, both regularization strategies are shown to produce
   accurate reconstructions when the measurement data is polluted with
   noise. The discrepancy principle is shown to produce nearly optimal
   solutions, while the error-balance approach, although not optimal,
   remains effective and does not need a priori information on the noise
   level.}},

Abstract = {{Although blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) is well recognized
   for its significance in the military population, the unique mechanisms
   of primary bTBI remain undefined. Animate models of primary bTBI are
   critical for determining these potentially unique mechanisms, but the
   biomechanical characteristics of many bTBI models are poorly understood.
   In this study, we examine some common shock tube configurations used to
   study blast-induced brain injury in the laboratory and define the
   optimal configuration to minimize the effect of torso overpressure and
   blast-induced head accelerations. Pressure transducers indicated that a
   customized animal holder successfully reduced peak torso overpressures
   to safe levels across all tested configurations. However, high speed
   video imaging acquired during the blast showed significant head
   accelerations occurred when animals were oriented perpendicular to the
   shock tube axis. These findings of complex head motions during blast are
   similar to previous reports {[}Goldstein et al., 2012, ``Chronic
   Traumatic Encephalopathy in Blast-Exposed Military Veterans and a Blast
   Neurotrauma Mouse Model,{''} Sci. Transl. Med., 4(134), 134ra160;
   Sundaramurthy et al., 2012, `` Blast-Induced Biomechanical Loading of
   the Rat: An Experimental and Anatomically Accurate Computational Blast
   Injury Model,{''} J. Neurotrauma, 29(13), pp. 2352-2364; Svetlov et al.,
   2010, ``Morphologic and Biochemical Characterization of Brain Injury in
   a Model of Controlled Blast Overpressure Exposure,{''} J. Trauma, 69(4),
   pp. 795-804]. Under the same blast input conditions, minimizing head
   acceleration led to a corresponding elimination of righting time
   deficits. However, we could still achieve righting time deficits under
   minimal acceleration conditions by significantly increasing the peak
   blast overpressure. Together, these data show the importance of
   characterizing the effect of blast overpressure on head kinematics, with
   the goal of producing models focused on understanding the effects of
   blast overpressure on the brain without the complicating factor of
   superimposed head accelerations.}},

Abstract = {{The major roles of filtration, metabolism and high blood flow make the
   kidney highly vulnerable to drug-induced toxicity and other renal
   injuries. A method to follow kidney function is essential for the early
   screening of toxicity and malformations. In this study, we acquired high
   spatiotemporal resolution (four dimensional) datasets of normal mice to
   follow changes in kidney structure and function during development. The
   data were acquired with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (via keyhole
   imaging) and a cryogenic surface coil, allowing us to obtain a full
   three-dimensional image (isotropic resolution, 125 microns) every 7.7 s
   over a 50-min scan. This time course permitted the demonstration of both
   contrast enhancement and clearance. Functional changes were measured
   over a 17-week course (at 3, 5, 7, 9, 13 and 17 weeks). The time
   dimension of the MRI dataset was processed to produce unique image
   contrasts to segment the four regions of the kidney: cortex (CO), outer
   stripe (OS) of the outer medulla (OM), inner stripe (IS) of the OM and
   inner medulla (IM). Local volumes, time-to-peak (TTP) values and decay
   constants (DC) were measured in each renal region. These metrics
   increased significantly with age, with the exception of DC values in the
   IS and OS. These data will serve as a foundation for studies of normal
   renal physiology and future studies of renal diseases that require early
   detection and intervention. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We propose the use of morphological optical biomarkers for
   rapid detection of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
   by leveraging the underlying tissue characteristics in aero-digestive
   tracts.
   Materials and Methods: Diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained from
   malignant and contra-lateral normal tissues of 57 patients undergoing
   panendoscopy and biopsy. Oxygen saturation, total hemoglobin
   concentration, and the reduced scattering coefficient were extracted.
   Differences in malignant and normal tissues were examined based on two
   different groupings: anatomical site and morphological tissue type.
   Results and Conclusions: Measurements were acquired from 252 sites, of
   which 51 were pathologically classified as SCC. Optical biomarkers
   exhibited statistical differences between malignant and normal samples.
   Contrast was enhanced when parsing tissues by morphological
   classification rather than anatomical subtype for unpaired comparisons.
   Corresponding linear discriminant models using multiple optical
   biomarkers showed improved predictive ability when accounting for
   morphological classification, particularly in node-positive lesions. The
   false-positive rate was retrospectively found to decrease by 34.2\% in
   morphologically-vs. anatomically-derived predictive models. In glottic
   tissue, the surgeon exhibited a false-positive rate of 45.7\% while the
   device showed a lower false-positive rate of 12.4\%. Additionally,
   comparisons of optical parameters were made to further understand the
   physiology of tumor staging and potential causes of high surgeon
   false-positive rates. Optical spectroscopy is a user-friendly,
   non-invasive tool capable of providing quantitative information to
   discriminate malignant from normal head and neck tissues. Predictive
   models demonstrated promising results for real-time diagnostics.
   Furthermore, the strategy described appears to be well suited to reduce
   the clinical false-positive rate. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A compact ultrawideband (UWB) planar bandpass filter (BPF) using
   quad-T-stub-loaded ring resonator is presented. At this filter, two sets
   of the four high impedance lines at the two sides of the ring as the

   Compared with the conventional ring resonator filter, the bandwidth of
   the UWB BPF can be improved after we load four T-shaped stubs on the
   ring resonator. That is because these stubs can increase the effective
   electrical lengths, and also lower the second and third resonant
   frequencies of the ring resonator at no expense of the size increase.
   Finally, a prototype of the proposed UWB BPF with 3 dB fractional
   bandwidth of 101\% has been designed and fabricated. The measured
   results are in good agreement with the full-wave simulations. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Although conditioned fear can be effectively extinguished by
   unreinforced exposure to a threat cue, fear responses tend to return
   when the cue is encountered some time after extinction (spontaneous
   recovery), in a novel environment (renewal), or following presentation
   of an aversive stimulus (reinstatement). As extinction represents a
   context-dependent form of new learning, one possible strategy to
   circumvent the return of fear is to conduct extinction across several
   environments. Here, we tested the effectiveness of multiple context
   extinction in a two-day fear conditioning experiment using 3-D virtual
   reality technology to create immersive, ecologically-valid context
   changes. Fear-potentiated startle served as the dependent measure. All
   three experimental groups initially acquired fear in a single context. A
   multiple extinction group then underwent extinction in three contexts,
   while a second group underwent extinction in the acquisition context and
   a third group underwent extinction in a single different context. All
   groups returned 24 h later to test for return of fear in the extinction
   context (spontaneous recovery) and a novel context (renewal and
   reinstatement/test). Extinction in multiple contexts attenuated
   reinstatement of fear but did not reduce spontaneous recovery. Results
   from fear renewal were tendential. Our findings suggest that
   multi-context extinction can reduce fear relapse following an aversive
   event - an event that often induces return of fear in real-world
   settings - and provides empirical support for conducting exposure-based
   clinical treatments across a variety of environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Various compositions of sparsely polarized antenna arrays are proposed
   in this paper to estimate the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) and
   polarizations of multiple coherent sources. These polarized antenna
   arrays are composed of one of the following five sparsely spread
   sub-array geometries: (1) four spatially spread dipoles with three
   orthogonal orientations, (2) four spatially spread loops with three
   orthogonal orientations, (3) three spatially spread dipoles and three
   spatially spread loops with orthogonal orientations, (4) three
   collocated dipole-loop pairs with orthogonal orientations, and (5) a
   collocated dipole-triad and a collocated loop-triad. All the
   dipoles/loops/pairs/triads in each sub-array can also be sparsely spaced
   with the inter-antenna spacing far larger than a half-wavelength. Only
   one dimensional spatial-smoothing is used in the proposed algorithm to
   derive the two-dimensional DOAs and polarizations of multiple
   cross-correlated signals. From the simulation results, the sparse array
   composed of dipole-triads and loop-triads is recommended to construct a
   large aperture array, while the sparse arrays composed of only dipoles
   or only loops are recommended to efficiently reduce the mutual coupling
   across the antennas. Practical applications include distributed arrays
   and passive radar systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By applying an asymmetric on-site restoring force in a 1D chain of
   oscillators, we demonstrate experimentally that a morphing in the
   bandgap structure or passive bandgap reconfiguration can be triggered by
   an increase in environmental excitation amplitude. Recent studies on
   wave propagation have focused on new capabilities and behaviors
   resulting from intrinsic nonlinearities. This paper details a bistable
   experimental design that achieves amplitude dependent filtering through
   passive bandgap reconfiguration, which is triggered by a bifurcation.
   The system studied comprises a 1D chain of axially aligned pendulums in
   dimer unit cells with geometrically nonlinear nearest neighbor coupling
   where bistability is induced through repulsive magnets. When the
   bistability is asymmetric, each potential well has a different linear
   spectra. Though this paper uses mechanically coupled oscillators as an
   example, the phenomenon itself could be used in any wave propagation
   media where asymmetric bistability can be implemented. (C) 2014 AIP

Title = {{The impact on CT dose of the variability in tube current modulation
   technology: a theoretical investigation}},

Abstract = {{Body CT scans are routinely performed using tube-current-modulation
   (TCM) technology. There is notable variability across CT manufacturers
   in terms of how TCM technology is implemented. Some manufacturers aim to
   provide uniform image noise across body regions and patient sizes,
   whereas others aim to provide lower noise for smaller patients. The
   purpose of this study was to conduct a theoretical investigation to
   understand how manufacturer-dependent TCM scheme affects organ dose, and
   to develop a generic approach for assessing organ dose across TCM
   schemes. The adult reference female extended cardiac-torso (XCAT)
   phantom was used for this study. A ray-tracing method was developed to
   calculate the attenuation of the phantom for a given projection angle
   based on phantom anatomy, CT system geometry, x-ray energy spectrum, and
   bowtie filter filtration. The tube current (mA) for a given projection
   angle was then calculated as a log-linear function of the attenuation
   along that projection. The slope of this function, termed modulation
   control strength, alpha, was varied from 0 to 1 to emulate the
   variability in TCM technology. Using a validated Monte Carlo program,
   organ dose was simulated for five alpha values (alpha = 0, 0.25, 0.5,
   0.75, and 1) in the absence and presence of a realistic system mA limit.
   Organ dose was further normalized by volume-weighted CT dose index
   (CTDIvol) to obtain conversion factors (h factors) that are relatively
   independent of system specifics and scan parameters. For both chest and
   abdomen-pelvis scans and for 24 radiosensitive organs, organ dose
   conversion factors varied with alpha, following second-order polynomial
   equations. This result suggested the need for alpha-specific organ dose
   conversion factors (i.e., conversion factors specific to the modulation
   scheme used). On the other hand, across the full range of a values,
   organ dose in a TCM scan could be derived from the conversion factors
   established for a fixed-mA scan (h(FIXED)). This was possible by
   multiplying h(FIXED) by a revised definition of CTDIvol that accounts
   for two factors: (alpha) the tube currents at the location of an organ
   and (b) the variation in organ volume along the longitudinal direction.
   This alpha-generic approach represents an approximation. The error
   associated with this approximation was evaluated using the
   alpha-specific organ dose (i.e., the organ dose obtained by using
   alpha-specific mA profiles as inputs into the Monte Carlo simulation) as
   the reference standard. When the mA profiles were constrained by a
   realistic system limit, this alpha-generic approach had errors of less
   than similar to 20\% for the full range of alpha values. This was the
   case for 24 radiosensitive organs in both chest and abdomen-pelvis CT
   scans with the exception of thyroid in the chest scan and bladder in the
   abdomen-pelvis scan. For these two organs, the errors were less than
   similar to 40\%. The results of this theoretical study suggested that
   knowing the mA modulation profile and the fixed-mA conversion factors,
   organ dose may be estimated for a TCM scan independent of the specific
   modulation scheme applied.}},

Abstract = {{Scattering limits the penetration depth of most optical imaging

   optical or computational schemes. We have developed a new method of
   assessing tissue properties based on spectroscopic analysis of multiply

   low-coherence interferometry (ms2/LCI), uses coherence and spatial
   gating to produce images of tissue optical properties up to 9 mm deep,
   with millimeter-scale resolution. The capabilities of ms2/LCI are
   demonstrated using tissue phantoms composed of chicken breast.
   Discrimination of diseased and healthy tissues is shown through imaging
   and analysis of burns in ex vivo human skin samples. Our technique may
   provide a powerful way to assess burn depth and progression in
   sensitive, burned tissues where physical contact is undesirable. (C)

Title = {{Linear Population Allocation by Bistable Switches in Response to
   Transient Stimulation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Many cellular decision processes, including proliferation,
   differentiation, and phenotypic switching, are controlled by bistable
   signaling networks. In response to transient or intermediate input
   signals, these networks allocate a population fraction to each of two
   distinct states (e.g. OFF and ON). While extensive studies have been
   carried out to analyze various bistable networks, they are primarily
   focused on responses of bistable networks to sustained input signals. In
   this work, we investigate the response characteristics of bistable
   networks to transient signals, using both theoretical analysis and
   numerical simulation. We find that bistable systems exhibit a common
   property: for input signals with short durations, the fraction of
   switching cells increases linearly with the signal duration, allowing
   the population to integrate transient signals to tune its response. We
   propose that this allocation algorithm can be an optimal response
   strategy for certain cellular decisions in which excessive switching
   results in lower population fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The production of methylmercury (MeHg) by anaerobic microorganisms
   depends in part on the speciation and bioavailability of inorganic
   mercury to these organisms. Our previous work with pure cultures of
   methylating bacteria has demonstrated that the methylation potential of
   mercury decreased during the aging of mercuric sulfides (from dissolved
   to nanoparticulate and microcrystalline HgS). The objective of this
   study was to understand the relationship between mercury sulfide
   speciation and methylation potential in experiments that more closely
   simulate the complexity of sediment settings. The study involved
   sediment slurry microcosms that represented a spectrum of salinities in
   an estuary and were each amended with different forms of mercuric
   sulfides: dissolved Hg and sulfide, nanoparticulate HgS (3-4 nm in
   diameter), and microparticulate HgS (>500 nm). The results indicated
   that net MeHg production was influenced by both the activity of
   sulfate-reducing microorganisms (roughly represented by the rate of
   sulfate loss) and the bioavailability of mercury. In the presence of
   abundant sulfate and carbon sources (supporting relatively high
   microbial activity), net MeHg production in the slurries amended with
   dissolved Hg was greater than in slurries amended with nano-HgS, similar
   to previous experiments with pure bacterial cultures. In microcosms with
   minimal microbial activity (indicated by low rates of sulfate loss), the
   addition of either dissolved Hg or nano-HgS resulted in similar amounts
   of net MeHg production. For all slurries receiving micro-HgS, MeHg
   production did not exceed abiotic controls. In slurries amended with
   dissolved and nano-HgS, mercury was mainly partitioned to bulk-scale
   mineral particles and colloids, indicating that Hg bioavailability was
   not simply related to dissolved Hg concentration or speciation. Overall,
   the results suggest that models for mercury methylation potential in the
   environment will need to balance the relative contributions of mercury
   speciation and activity of methylating microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{disease epidemics caused by pathogenic spores are common threat to
   agricultural crops. Pathogenic spores are often produced and released
   inside plant canopies but are transported out of the canopy region by
   turbulent motions and advected longitudinally over long distances so as
   to infect other fields. Hence, the fraction of spores that ``escape{''}
   the canopy sets the effective source strength that determines how fast
   and far plant diseases can spread. To explore the governing variables of
   this escape and spatial spread of spores, extensive spore release and
   recapture experiments were conducted in a maize field and interpreted
   using a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian stochastic model (LSM). Spores were
   released from point sources located at three prototypical depths inside
   the canopy. Concentration measurements were obtained inside and above
   the canopy with a 3-dimensional grid of spore collectors. The
   experimental measurements of mean spore concentration were then used to
   evaluate an LSM for spore dispersion. The drift and dispersion terms of
   the LSM were predicted employing a conventional second-order closure
   model of turbulence within plant canopies thereby allowing this combined
   Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation to be applied to a broad set of
   agricultural crops. The dispersion model includes spore deposition on
   and rebound from canopy elements. The combination of experimental and
   numerical simulations was then used to quantify the fraction of spores
   that escape the canopy. Effects of release height and friction velocity
   on the escape fraction of spores were explored with the LSM. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We introduce a framework for population analysis of white matter tracts
   based on diffusion-weighted images of the brain. The framework enables
   extraction of fibers from high angular resolution diffusion images
   (HARD!); clustering of the fibers based partly on prior knowledge from
   an atlas; representation of the fiber bundles compactly using a path
   following points of highest density (maximum density path; MDP); and
   registration of these paths together using geodesic curve matching to
   find local correspondences across a population. We demonstrate our
   method on 4-Tesla HARDI scans from 565 young adults to compute localized
   statistics across 50 white matter tracts based on fractional anisotropy
   (FA). Experimental results show increased sensitivity in the
   determination of genetic influences on principal fiber tracts compared
   to the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method. Our results show
   that the MDP representation reveals important parts of the white matter
   structure and considerably reduces the dimensionality over comparable
   fiber matching approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},
