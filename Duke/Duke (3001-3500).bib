Abstract = {{Laser Doppler anemometery and laser-induced fluorescence techniques were
   used to explore the spatial structure of the flow within and above
   finite cavities created within porous and solid media. The cavities
   within these two configurations were identical in size and were intended
   to mimic flow disturbances created by finite gaps and forest clearing.
   Because flows over permeable boundaries differ from their solid
   counterparts, the study here addresses how these differences in boundary
   conditions produce differences in, (i) bulk flow properties including
   the mean vorticity within and adjacent to the gaps, (ii) second-order
   statistics such as the standard deviations and turbulent stresses, (iii)
   the relative importance of advective to turbulent stress terms across
   various regions within and above the gaps, and (iv) the local imbalance
   between ejections and sweeps and momentum transport efficiencies of
   updrafts and downdrafts. Both configurations exhibited a primary
   recirculation zone of comparable dimensions inside the gap. The mean
   vorticity spawned at the upstream corner of the gap was more intense for
   the solid configuration when compared to its porous counterpart. The
   free-shear layer spawned from the upstream corner-edge deeper into the
   gap for the porous configuration. The momentum flux at the interface
   within and above the gap was enhanced by a factor of 1.5-2.0 over its
   upstream value, and this enhancement zone was much broader in size for
   the porous configuration. For the turbulent transport terms in the
   longitudinal and vertical mean momentum balances, these transport terms
   were significant inside the gap for both boundary configurations when
   compared to their upstream counterpart. The effectiveness of using
   incomplete cumulant expansion methods to describe the momentum transport
   efficiencies, and the relative contributions of ejections and sweeps to
   turbulent stresses, especially in this zone, were also demonstrated. The
   flatness factor for both velocity components, often used as a measure of
   intermittency, was highest in the vicinity of the upstream corner in
   both configurations. However, immediately following the downstream
   corner, the flatness factor remained large for the porous configuration,
   in contrast to its solid configuration counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{Most recent low-rank tensor completion algorithms are based on tensor
   nuclear norm minimization problems. The convex relaxation problem of
   tensor n-rank minimization has to be solved iteratively and involves
   multiple singular value decompositions (SVDs) at each iteration, and
   thus such algorithms suffer from high computation cost. In this letter,
   we propose an efficient low-rank tensor completion approach. First, we
   introduce a matrix factorization idea into the tensor nuclear norm
   model, and then can achieve a much smaller scale matrix nuclear norm
   minimization problem. Moreover, we develop an efficient iterative scheme
   for solving the proposed model with orthogonality constraint. Our
   extensive evaluation results validate both the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and plant hydraulics constrain ecosystem productivity by setting
   physical limits to water transport and hence carbon uptake by leaves.
   While more negative xylem water potentials provide a larger driving
   force for water transport, they also cause cavitation that limits
   hydraulic conductivity. An optimum balance between driving force and
   cavitation occurs at intermediate water potentials, thus defining the
   maximum transpiration rate the xylem can sustain (denoted as Emax). The
   presence of this maximum raises the question as to whether plants
   regulate transpiration through stomata to function near Emax. To address
   this question, we calculated Emax across plant functional types and
   climates using a hydraulic model and a global database of plant
   hydraulic traits. The predicted Emax compared well with measured peak
   transpiration across plant sizes and growth conditions (R=0.86, P<0.001)
   and was relatively conserved among plant types (for a given plant size),
   while increasing across climates following the atmospheric evaporative
   demand. The fact that Emax was roughly conserved across plant types and
   scales with the product of xylem saturated conductivity and water
   potential at 50\% cavitation was used here to explain the
   safetyefficiency trade-off in plant xylem. Stomatal conductance allows
   maximum transpiration rates despite partial cavitation in the xylem
   thereby suggesting coordination between stomatal regulation and xylem
   hydraulic characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Transfection efficiencies and transgene expression kinetics of messenger
   RNA (mRNA), an emerging class of nucleic acid-based therapeutics, have
   been poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated transfection
   efficiencies of mRNA delivered in naked and nanoparticle format in vitro
   and in vivo using GFP and luciferase as reporters. While mRNA
   nanoparticles transfect primary human and mouse dendritic cells (DCs)
   efficiently in vitro, naked mRNA could not produce any detectable gene
   product. The protein expression of nanoparticle-mediated transfection in
   vitro peaks rapidly within 5-7 h and decays in a biphasic manner. In
   vivo, naked mRNA is more efficient than mRNA nanoparticles when
   administered subcutaneously. In contrast, mRNA nanoparticle performs
   better when administered intranasally and intravenously. Gene expression
   is most transient when delivered intravenously in nanoparticle format
   with an apparent half-life of 1.4 h and lasts less than 24 h, and most
   sustained when delivered in the naked format subcutaneously at the base
   of tail with an apparent half-life of 18 h and persists for at least 6
   days. Notably, exponential decreases in protein expression are
   consistently observed post-delivery of mRNA in vivo regardless of the
   mode of delivery (naked or nanoparticle) or the site of administration.
   This study elucidates the performance of mRNA transfection and suggests
   a niche for mRNA therapeutics when predictable in vivo transgene
   expression kinetics is imperative. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The spiking activity of nearby cortical neurons is correlated on both
   short and long time scales. Understanding this shared variability in
   firing patterns is critical for appreciating the representation of
   sensory stimuli in ensembles of neurons, the coincident influences of
   neurons on common targets, and the functional implications of
   microcircuitry. Our knowledge about neuronal correlations, however,
   derives largely from experiments that used different recording methods,
   analysis techniques, and cortical regions. Here we studied the structure
   of neuronal correlation in area V4 of alert macaques using recording and
   analysis procedures designed to match those used previously in primary
   visual cortex (V1), the major input to V4. We found that the spatial and
   temporal properties of correlations in V4 were remarkably similar to
   those of V1, with two notable differences: correlated variability in V4
   was approximately one-third the magnitude of that in V1 and synchrony in
   V4 was less temporally precise than in V1. In both areas, spontaneous
   activity (measured during fixation while viewing a blank screen) was
   approximately twice as correlated as visual-evoked activity. The results
   provide a foundation for understanding how the structure of neuronal
   correlation differs among brain regions and stages in cortical
   processing and suggest that it is likely governed by features of
   neuronal circuits that are shared across the visual cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury is a potent neurotoxin for humans, particularly if the metal is
   in the form of methylmercury. Mercury is widely distributed in aquatic
   ecosystems as a result of anthropogenic activities and natural earth
   processes. A first step toward bioaccumulation of methylmercury in
   aquatic food webs is the methylation of inorganic forms of the metal, a
   process that is primarily mediated by anaerobic bacteria. In this
   Review, we evaluate the current state of knowledge regarding the
   mechanisms regulating microbial mercury methylation, including the
   speciation of mercury in environments where methylation occurs and the
   processes that control mercury bioavailability to these organisms.
   Methylmercury production rates are generally related to the presence and
   productivity of methylating bacteria and also the uptake of inorganic
   mercury to these microorganisms. Our understanding of the mechanisms
   behind methylation is limited due to fundamental questions related to
   the geochemical forms of mercury that persist in anoxic settings, the
   mode of uptake by methylating bacteria, and the biochemical pathway by
   which these microorganisms produce and degrade methylmercury. In anoxic
   sediments and water, the geochemical forms of mercury (and subsequent
   bioavailability) are largely governed by reactions between Hg(II),
   inorganic sulfides, and natural organic matter. These interactions
   result in a mixture of dissolved, nanoparticulate, and larger
   crystalline particles that cannot be adequately represented by
   conventional chemical equilibrium models for Hg bioavailability. We
   discuss recent advances in nanogeochemistry and environmental
   microbiology that can provide new tools and unique perspectives to help
   us solve the question of how microorganisms methylate mercury. An
   understanding of the factors that cause the production and degradation
   of methylmercury in the environment is ultimately needed to inform
   policy makers and develop long-term strategies for controlling mercury
   contamination.}},

Title = {{Aquatic Biofouling Prevention by Electrically Charged Nanocomposite
   Polymer Thin Film Membranes}},

Abstract = {{Electrically conductive polymer-nanocomposite (ECPNC) tight
   nanofiltration (NF) thin film membranes were demonstrated to have
   biofilm-preventing capabilities under extreme bacteria and organic
   material loadings. A simple route to the creation and application of
   these polyamide-carbon nanotube thin films is also reported. These thin
   films were characterized with SEM and TEM as well as FTIR to demonstrate
   that the carbon nanotubes are embedded within the polyamide and form
   ester bonds with trimesoyl chloride, one of the monomers of polyamide.
   These polymer nanocomposite thin film materials boast high electrical
   conductivity (similar to 400 S/m), good NaCl rejection (>95\%), and high
   water permeability. To demonstrate these membranes' biofouling
   capabilities, we designed a cross-flow water filtration vessel with
   insulated electrical leads connecting the ECPNC membranes to an
   arbitrary waveform generator. In all experiments, conducted in highly
   bacterially contaminated LB media, flux tests were run until fluxes
   decreased by 45 +/- 3\% over initial flux. Biofilm-induced,
   nonreversible flux decline was observed in all control experiments and a
   cross-flow rinse with the feed solution failed to induce flux recovery.
   In contrast, flux decrease for the ECPNC membranes with an electric
   potential applied to their surface was only caused by deposition of
   bacteria rather than bacterial attachment, and flux was fully
   recoverable following a short rinse with the feed solution and no added
   cleaning agents. The prevention of biofilm formation on the ECPNC
   membranes was a long-term effect, did not decrease with use, and was
   highly reproducible.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional boundary element formulation of an incompressible
   viscoelastic layer of finite thickness is proposed, in a moving frame of
   reference. The formulation is based on two-dimensional Fourier series
   expansions of relevant mechanical fields in the continuum of the layer.
   The linear viscoelastic material is characterized, in the most general
   way, by its frequency-domain master curves. The presented methodology
   results in a compliance matrix for the layer's upper boundary, which
   includes the effects of steady-state motion and can be used in any
   contact problem-solving strategy. The proposed formulation is used, in
   combination with a contact solver, to build a full three-dimensional
   model for the steady-state rolling/sliding resistance incurred by a
   rigid sphere on the layer. Energy losses include viscoelastic damping
   and surface friction. The model is tested and its results are found to
   be consistent with existing solutions in limiting cases. An example is
   explored and the corresponding results are used to illustrate the
   influence of different parameters on the rolling resistance. General
   aspects of previously-described dependences are confirmed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents simple, yet robust and efficient algorithms for
   solving steady-state, frictional, rolling/sliding contact problems, in
   two and three dimensions. These are alternatives to powerful, well
   established, but in particular instances, possibly `cumbersome'
   general-purpose numerical techniques, such as finite-element approaches
   based on constrained optimization. The cores of the solvers rely on very
   general principles: (i) resolving motional conflicts, and (ii)
   eliminating unacceptable surface tractions. The proposed algorithms are
   formulated in the context of small deformations and applied to the cases
   of a rigid cylinder and a rigid sphere rolling on a linear viscoelastic
   layer of finite thickness, in two and three dimensions, respectively.
   The underlying principles are elucidated, relevant mathematical
   expressions derived and details given about corresponding implementation
   techniques. The proposed contact algorithms can be extended to more
   general settings involving a deformable indenter, material
   nonlinearities and large deformations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Trapped atomic ions are standards for quantum information processing,

   The outstanding challenge is the scaling of trapped ions to hundreds or
   thousands of qubits and beyond, at which scale quantum processors can
   outperform their classical counterparts in certain applications. We
   review the latest progress and prospects in that effort, with the

Abstract = {{A method was developed to assess the multi-directional modulation
   transfer function (MTF) of breast tomosynthesis imaging systems using a
   sphere phantom. The method was initially developed based on a simulation
   dataset. Projections were simulated for a uniform voxelized breast
   phantom with sphere inserts using a fluence modeled from a 28 kVp beam
   incident upon an indirect flat-panel detector. Based on cascaded systems
   modeling, characteristic noise and blurring were added to each
   projection. The projections were reconstructed using a standard filtered
   backprojection technique, producing a 3D volume with an isotropic voxel
   size of 200 mu m. ROIs that completely encompassed single spheres were
   extracted and conical regions were prescribed along the three major axes
   extending from the centroids. Pixels within the cones were used to form
   edge spread functions (ESFs), from which the directional MTFs were
   calculated. Binning size and conical range were adjusted to maximize the
   accuracy and to minimize the noise of the MTF. A method was further
   devised to remove out-of-plane artifacts from the ESF in the x-y plane.
   Finally, the method was applied to experimentally assess the directional
   MTF of a prototype tomosynthesis system. Comparisons of the sphere-based
   MTF along the different axes and the theoretical MTF yielded good
   agreement. A 30 degrees angular cone and a 20 mu m sampling were found
   to provide an ideal trade-off between the noise and accuracy of the
   measurement. The removal of artifacts in ESF yielded `modified' MTFs
   that enabled a resolution-only characterization of the in-slice
   resolution of tomosynthesis. Drop-off frequencies in the x- and
   y-directional MTFs were 1.6 cycles mm(-1) and 1.5 cycles mm(-1),
   respectively. The presented method of separating the effective
   resolution and artifacts from the measured ESF was found experimentally
   implementable and is expected to facilitate the interpretation of MTF
   measurements in tomosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Although the majority of first-line antidepressants increase brain
   serotonin and rare polymorphisms in tryptophan hydroxlase-2 (Tph2), the
   rate-limiting enzyme in the brain serotonin synthesis pathway, have been
   identified in cohorts of subjects with major depressive disorder, the
   circuit level alterations that results from serotonergic hypofunction
   remain poorly understood. Here we use chronic multicircuit
   neurophysiological recordings to characterize functional interactions
   across cortical and limbic circuits in mice engineered to express a
   human loss-of-function depression allele Tph2-(R441H) {[}Tph2 knockin
   (Tph2KI)]. Our results show that Tph2KI mice exhibit increased
   intra-network synchrony within medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basal
   amygdala (AMY) and increased inter-network synchrony between these two
   brain networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that chronic treatment with
   fluoxetine reverses several of the circuit alterations observed within
   Tph2KI mice. Together, our findings establish a functional link between
   functional hyposerotonergia and altered mPFC-AMY network dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Column experiments were conducted to investigate the transport of
   aqueous C-60 (aqu-nC(60)), fullerol, silver nanoparticles (NPs) coated
   with polyvinylpyrrolidone (Ag-PVP) and stabilized by citrate (Ag-CIT) in
   biofilm-laden porous media. Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)
   and Gram-positive Bacillus cereus (BC) biofilm-laden glass beads were
   selected to represent the bacterial interfaces NPs might encounter in
   the natural aquatic environment. The biomass distribution, extracellular
   polymeric substances (EPS) components, electrokinetic property, and
   hydrophobicity of these interfaces were characterized, and the
   hydrophobicity was found to correlate with the quantity of proteins in
   EPS. The retention of NPs on glass beads coated with bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) and alginate were also studied. Except for Ag-PVP, the
   affinity of NPs for porous medium, indicated by attachment efficiency
   alpha, increased in the presence of biofilms, BSA and alginate. For
   hydrophobic aqu-nC(60), the larger the proteins/polysaccharides ratio,
   the larger the alpha, suggesting the hydrophobic interaction determines
   the attachment of aqu-nC(60) to the collector surface. Uncharged PVP
   stabilized Ag-PVP by steric repulsion, and the attachment to glass beads
   was not enhanced by biofilm. The presence of divalent ion Ca2+
   significantly hydrophobized biofilm, BSA, and alginate-coated glass
   beads and further retarded the mobility of aqu-nC(60), fullerol, and
   Ag-CIT; while Ag-PVP was again sterically stabilized.}},

   Activity with Caspofungin or FK506 against Candida albicans}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{The object of this study was to test whether posaconazole, a
   broad-spectrum antifungal agent inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis,
   exhibits synergy with the beta-1,3 glucan synthase inhibitor caspofungin
   or the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 against the human fungal pathogen
   Candida albicans. Although current drug treatments for Candida infection
   are often efficacious, the available antifungal armamentarium may not be
   keeping pace with the increasing incidence of drug resistant strains.
   The development of drug combinations or novel antifungal drugs to
   address emerging drug resistance is therefore of general importance.
   Combination drug therapies are employed to treat patients with HIV,
   cancer, or tuberculosis, and has considerable promise in the treatment
   of fungal infections like cryptococcal meningitis and C. albicans
   infections. Our studies reported here demonstrate that posaconazole
   exhibits in vitro synergy with caspofungin or FK506 against drug
   susceptible or resistant C. albicans strains. Furthermore, these
   combinations also show in vivo synergy against C. albicans strain SC5314
   and its derived echinocandin-resistant mutants, which harbor an S645Y
   mutation in the CaFks1 beta-1,3 glucan synthase drug target, suggesting
   potential therapeutic applicability for these combinations in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Although radiation induced reoxygenation has
   been thought to increase radiosensitivity, we have shown that its
   associated oxidative stress can have radioprotective effects, including
   stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1
   (HIF-1). HIF-1 is known to regulate many of the glycolytic enzymes,
   thereby promoting aerobic glycolysis, which is known to promote
   treatment resistance. Thus, we hypothesized that reoxygenation after
   radiation would increase glycolysis. We previously showed that blockade
   of oxidative stress using a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic during
   reoxygenation can downregulate HIF-1 activity. Here we tested whether
   concurrent use of this drug with radiotherapy would reduce the switch to
   a glycolytic phenotype.
   Materials and methods: 40 mice with skin fold window chambers implanted
   with 4T1 mammary carcinomas were randomized into (1) no treatment, (2)
   radiation alone, (3) SOD mimic alone, and (4) SOD mimic with concurrent
   radiation. All mice were imaged on the ninth day following tumor
   implantation (30 h following radiation treatment) following injection of
   a fluorescent glucose analog,
   2-{[}N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diaxol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose
   (2-NBDG). Hemoglobin saturation was measured by using hyperspectral
   imaging to quantify oxygenation state.
   Results: Mice treated with radiation showed significantly higher 2-NBDG
   fluorescence compared to controls (p = 0.007). Hemoglobin saturation
   analysis demonstrated reoxygenation following radiation, coinciding with
   the observed increase in glycolysis. The concurrent use of the SOD mimic
   with radiation demonstrated a significant reduction in 2-NBDG
   fluorescence compared to effects seen after radiation alone, while
   having no effect on reoxygenation.
   Conclusions: Radiation induces an increase in tumor glucose demand
   approximately 30 h following therapy during reoxygenation. The use of an
   SOD mimic can prevent the increase in aerobic glycolysis when used
   concurrently with radiation, without preventing reoxygenation. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, the Liapunov-Floquet transformation (LFT) is applied to a
   time-periodic delay differential equation (DDE) discretized by the
   Chebyshev spectral continuous time approximation. The proposed combined
   approach allows for the stability and time-response analysis of a
   constant non-delayed analog of the original periodic DDE by applying the
   LFT to an equivalent large-order system of time-periodic ordinary
   differential equations. The implementation issues are analyzed for the
   time-delayed Mathieu's equation which is used as an example. It is shown
   that an order reduction procedure in which only the dominant modes of
   the infinite-dimensional DDE are retained in the LFT is necessary. The
   application of the proposed technique is studied in the presence of
   delay and parametric resonances for the delayed Mathieu's equation, as
   well as for a double inverted pendulum subjected to a time-periodic
   retarded follower force.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{There is a widespread agreement that more effective drug delivery
   vehicles with more alternatives, as well as better active pharmaceutical
   ingredients (APIs), must be developed to improve the efficacy of
   microbicide products. For instance, in tropical regions, films are more
   appropriate than gels due to better stability of drugs at extremes of
   moisture and temperature. Here, we apply fundamental fluid mechanical
   and physicochemical transport theory to help better understand how
   successful microbicide API delivery depends upon properties of a film
   and the human reproductive tract environment. Several critical
   components of successful drug delivery are addressed. Among these are:
   elastohydrodynamic flow of a dissolved non-Newtonian film; mass transfer
   due to inhomogeneous dilution of the film by vaginal fluid contacting it
   along a moving boundary (the locally deforming vaginal epithelial
   surface); and drug absorption by the epithelium. Local rheological
   properties of the film are dependent on local volume fraction of the
   vaginal fluid. We evaluated this experimentally, delineating the way
   that constitutive parameters of a shear-thinning dissolved film are
   modified by dilution. To develop the mathematical model, we integrate
   the Reynolds lubrication equation with a mass conservation equation to
   model diluting fluid movement across the moving vaginal epithelial
   surface and into the film. This is a complex physicochemical phenomenon
   that is not well understood. We explore time- and space-varying boundary
   flux model based upon osmotic gradients. Results show that the model
   produces fluxes that are comparable to experimental data. Further
   experimental characterization of the vaginal wall is required for a more
   precise set of parameters and a more sophisticated theoretical treatment
   of epithelium. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Supplemental irrigation represents one of the main strategies to
   mitigate the effects of climatic variability on agroecosystems,
   stabilizing yields and profits. Because of the significant investments
   and water requirements associated with irrigation, strategic choices are
   needed to preserve productivity and profitability while ensuring a
   sustainable water management, a nontrivial task given rainfall
   unpredictability. Decision-making under uncertainty requires the
   knowledge of the probability density function (pdf) of the outcome
   variable (yield and economic return) for the different management
   alternatives to be considered (here, irrigation strategies). A
   stochastic framework is proposed, linking probabilistically the
   occurrence of rainfall events and irrigation applications to crop
   development during the growing season. Based on these linkages, the pdf
   of yields and the corresponding irrigation requirements are obtained
   analytically as a function of climate, soil, and crop parameters, for
   different irrigation strategies and both unlimited and limited water
   availability. Approximate expressions are also presented to facilitate
   their application. Our results employ relatively few parameters and are
   thus broadly applicable to different crops and sites, under current-and
   future-climate scenarios, offering a quantitative tool to quantify the
   impact of irrigation strategies and water allocation on yields. As a
   tool for decision-making under uncertainty (e. g., via expected utility
   theory), our framework will be useful for the assessment of the
   feasibility of different irrigation strategies and water allocations,
   toward a sustainable management of water resources for human and
   environmental needs. Citation: Vico, G., and A. Porporato (2013),

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an improved expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm
   for phase-type (PH) distributions with grouped and truncated data.
   Olsson (1996) derived an EM algorithm for PH distributions under
   censored data, and the similar technique can be utilized to the PH
   fitting even under grouped and truncated data. However, it should be
   noted that Olsson's algorithm has a drawback in terms of computation
   speed. Because the time complexity of the algorithm is a cube of number
   of phases, it does not work well in the case where the number of phases
   is large. This paper proposes an improvement of the EM algorithm under
   grouped and truncated observations. By applying a uniformization-based
   technique for continuous-time Markov chains, it is shown that the time
   complexity of our algorithm can be reduced to the square of number of
   phases. In particular, when we consider the PH fitting using a canonical
   form of PH distributions, the time complexity is linear in the number of
   phases. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Analysis and Optimization of Pulse Dynamics for Magnetic Stimulation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic stimulation is a standard tool in brain research and has found
   important clinical applications in neurology, psychiatry, and
   rehabilitation. Whereas coil designs and the spatial field properties
   have been intensively studied in the literature, the temporal dynamics
   of the field has received less attention. Typically, the magnetic field
   waveform is determined by available device circuit topologies rather
   than by consideration of what is optimal for neural stimulation. This
   paper analyzes and optimizes the waveform dynamics using a nonlinear
   model of a mammalian axon. The optimization objective was to minimize
   the pulse energy loss. The energy loss drives power consumption and
   heating, which are the dominating limitations of magnetic stimulation.
   The optimization approach is based on a hybrid global-local method.
   Different coordinate systems for describing the continuous waveforms in
   a limited parameter space are defined for numerical stability. The
   optimization results suggest that there are waveforms with substantially
   higher efficiency than that of traditional pulse shapes. One class of
   optimal pulses is analyzed further. Although the coil voltage profile of
   these waveforms is almost rectangular, the corresponding current shape
   presents distinctive characteristics, such as a slow low-amplitude first
   phase which precedes the main pulse and reduces the losses.
   Representatives of this class of waveforms corresponding to different
   maximum voltages are linked by a nonlinear transformation. The main
   phase, however, scales with time only. As with conventional magnetic
   stimulation pulses, briefer pulses result in lower energy loss but
   require higher coil voltage than longer pulses.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a magnetic technique for assembling bidisperse and

   structures with dimensionality ranging from O-D (rings) to 1-D (chains)
   to 2-D (tiles). Compared with prior work on bidisperse particles that
   are commensurate in size, here we explore the assembly of different
   sized particles, and we show that due to packing constraints, new
   particle structures can be realized experimentally. Extending these
   experiments to a tridisperse system, we demonstrate that at low
   concentrations the smallest particle does not change the underlying
   crystal structures of the bidisperse system; however, it can assist in
   the formation of crystallite structures that were not stable in a
   bidisperse system. Additionally, we discovered that the smallest
   particle mimics the role of the ferroffuld, by shifting the locations in
   phase space where the bidIsperse crystal structures can be
   experimentally obtained. Finally, we demonstrate that 3-particle crystal
   structures can be tuned by varying the strength of the external field,
   which Is not possible in a 2-particle system.}},

Title = {{On the complementary relationship between marginal nitrogen and
   water-use efficiencies among Pinus taeda leaves grown under ambient and
   CO2-enriched environments}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Water and nitrogen (N) are two limiting resources
   for biomass production of terrestrial vegetation. Water losses in
   transpiration (E) can be decreased by reducing leaf stomatal conductance
   (g(s)) at the expense of lowering CO2 uptake (A), resulting in increased
   water-use efficiency. However, with more N available, higher allocation
   of N to photosynthetic proteins improves A so that N-use efficiency is
   reduced when g(s) declines. Hence, a trade-off is expected between these
   two resource-use efficiencies. In this study it is hypothesized that
   when foliar concentration (N) varies on time scales much longer than
   g(s), an explicit complementary relationship between the marginal water-
   and N-use efficiency emerges. Furthermore, a shift in this relationship
   is anticipated with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration (c(a)).
   Methods Optimization theory is employed to quantify interactions between
   resource-use efficiencies under elevated c(a) and soil N amendments. The
   analyses are based on marginal water- and N-use efficiencies, lambda =
   (partial derivative A/partial derivative g(s))/(partial derivative
   E/partial derivative g(s)) and eta = partial derivative A/partial
   derivative N, respectively. The relationship between the two
   efficiencies and related variation in intercellular CO2 concentration
   (c(i)) were examined using A/c(i) curves and foliar N measured on Pinus
   taeda needles collected at various canopy locations at the Duke Forest
   Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment (North Carolina, USA).
   Key Results Optimality theory allowed the definition of a novel,
   explicit relationship between two intrinsic leaf-scale properties where
   eta is complementary to the square-root of lambda. The data support the
   model predictions that elevated c(a) increased eta and lambda, and at
   given c(a) and needle age-class, the two quantities varied among needles
   in an approximately complementary manner.
   Conclusions The derived analytical expressions can be employed in
   scaling-up carbon, water and N fluxes from leaf to ecosystem, but also
   to derive transpiration estimates from those of eta, and assist in
   predicting how increasing c(a) influences ecosystem water use.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma, the most common primary malignant brain tumor, is among
   the most difficult cancers to treat. Despite the aggressive standard of
   care, including surgical removal followed by radiotherapy with
   concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy, the often sudden onset, diffuse
   infiltrating nature and highly malignant features of the lesion result
   in a median overall survival of < 15 months. Currently employed
   standard-of-care therapy for glioblastoma is nonspecific, leading to
   premature withdrawal of treatment due to off-target toxicity.
   Rindopepimut is a peptide-based vaccine that elicits a potent humoral
   and cellular immune response specifically against cells expressing
   EGFRvIII, a rearranged, cell-surface tyrosine kinase receptor present
   exclusively in glioblastoma and other common neoplasms. Several phase I
   and phase II clinical trials have demonstrated that vaccination with
   rindopepimut is safe, well tolerated and produces a highly potent immune
   response that effectively eradicates EGFRvIII-expressing tumor cells,
   leading to a 73\% increase in survival among patients with newly
   diagnosed glioblastoma. Furthermore, temozolomide-induced lymphopenia
   enhances the rindopepimut-induced immune response against EGFRvIII,
   allowing for enhanced vaccination responses in the context of
   standard-of-care chemotherapy. Rindopepimut is currently undergoing
   evaluation in a phase III international trial for newly diagnosed
   glioblastoma and is under clinical investigation for recurrent
   glioblastoma and pediatric brain stem gliomas.}},

Abstract = {{A facile electrochemical functionalization method was utilized to
   decorate single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with tin oxide and their
   gas sensing performance toward various analytes (NH3, NO2, H-2, H2S,
   acetone, and water vapor) was evaluated at room temperature. Tin
   oxy-hydroxide was sitespecifically precipitated on the surface of SWNTs
   because of an increase in local pH during electrochemical reduction of
   nitrate to nitrite ions. By adjusting the amount of charge passed during
   deposition, the amount of tin oxide deposited on SWNTs was controlled,
   which altered the electronic and gas sensing properties of the
   nanostructures. The resulting hybrid nanostructures showed excellent
   sensitivities upon exposure to trace amounts of both oxidizing gases
   (limit of detection (LOD) of 25 ppbv for NO2) and reducing gases (LOD of
   10 ppmv for H-2) at room temperature. The enhanced sensing performance
   was due to the charge transfer between the surface active tin oxide
   nanoparticles and SWNTs, with the direction of charge transfer depending
   on the analyte gas. This approach can be applied to fabricate other
   hybrid metal oxide-SWNTs nanostructures to create highly sensitive gas
   sensor arrays. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus gattii, which is causing an outbreak
   in the Pacific North-west region of North America, causes
   life-threatening pulmonary infections and meningoencephalitis in healthy
   individuals, unlike Cryptococcus neoformans, which commonly infects
   immunocompromised patients. In addition to a greater predilection for C.
   gattii to infect healthy hosts, the C. gattii genome sequence project
   revealed extensive chromosomal rearrangements compared with C.
   neoformans, showing genomic differences between the two Cryptococcus
   species. We investigated the roles of C. gattii calcineurin in three
   molecular types: VGIIa (R265), VGIIb (R272), and VGI (WM276). We found
   that calcineurin exhibits a differential requirement for growth on solid
   medium at 37 degrees, as calcineurin mutants generated from R265 were
   more thermotolerant than mutants from R272 and WM276. We demonstrated
   that tolerance to calcineurin inhibitors (FK506, CsA) at 37 degrees is
   linked with the VGIIa molecular type. The calcineurin mutants from the
   R272 background showed the most extensive growth and morphological
   defects (multi-vesicle and larger ring-like cells), as well as increased
   fluconazole susceptibility. Our cellular architecture examination showed
   that C. gattii and C. neoformans calcineurin mutants exhibit plasma
   membrane disruptions. Calcineurin in the C. gattii VGII molecular type
   plays a greater role in controlling cation homeostasis compared with
   that in C. gattii VGI and C. neoformans H99. Importantly, we demonstrate
   that C. gattii calcineurin is essential for virulence in a murine
   inhalation model, supporting C. gattii calcineurin as an attractive
   antifungal drug target.}},

Abstract = {{Having previously presented the ultrasound brain helmet, a system for
   simultaneous 3-D ultrasound imaging via both temporal bone acoustic
   windows, the scanning geometry of this system is utilized to allow each
   matrix array to serve as a correction source for the opposing array.
   Aberration is estimated using cross-correlation of RF channel signals,
   followed by least mean squares solution of the resulting overdetermined
   system. Delay maps are updated and real-time 3-D scanning resumes. A
   first attempt is made at using multiple arrival time maps to correct
   multiple unique aberrators within a single transcranial imaging volume,
   i.e., several isoplanatic patches. This adaptive imaging technique,
   which uses steered unfocused waves transmitted by the opposing, or
   beacon, array, updates the transmit and receive delays of 5 isoplanatic
   patches within a 64 degrees x 64 degrees volume. In phantom experiments,
   color flow voxels above a common threshold have also increased by an
   average of 92\%, whereas color flow variance decreased by an average of
   10\%. This approach has been applied to both temporal acoustic windows
   of two human subjects, yielding increases in echo brightness in 5
   isoplanatic patches with a mean value of 24.3 +/- 9.1\%, suggesting that
   such a technique may be beneficial in the future for performing
   noninvasive 3-D color flow imaging of cerebrovascular disease, including
   stroke.}},

Title = {{Modeling and analysis of software rejuvenation in a server virtualized
   system with live VM migration}},
Journal = {{PERFORMANCE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{212-230}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As server virtualization is used in a number of IT systems, the
   unavailability of virtual machines (VM) on server virtualized systems
   becomes a significant concern. Software rejuvenation is a promising
   technique for improving the availability of server virtualized systems
   as it can postpone or prevent failures caused by software aging in both
   the VM and the underlying virtual machine monitor (VMM). In this paper,
   we study the effectiveness of a combination of VMM rejuvenation and live
   VM migration. When a VMM needs to be rejuvenated, the hosted VMs running
   on the VMM can be moved to another host using live VM migration and
   continue the execution even during the VMM rejuvenation. We call this
   technique Migrate-VM rejuvenation and construct an availability model in
   the stochastic reward net for evaluating it in comparison with the
   conventional approaches; Cold-VM rejuvenation and Warm-VM rejuvenation.
   The designed model enables us to find the optimum combinations of
   rejuvenation trigger intervals that maximize the availability of VM. In
   terms of the maximum VM availability, Migrate-VM rejuvenation is
   potentially the best approach. However, the advantage of Migrate-VM
   rejuvenation depends on the type of live VM migration (stop-and-copy or
   pre-copy) and the policy for migration back to the original host after
   VMM rejuvenation (return-back or stay-on). Through numerical examples,
   we show that ``pre-copy{''} live VM migration is encouraged rather than
   pure ``stop-and-copy{''} migration and it is better to return back VM to
   the original host soon after the VMM rejuvenation (i.e.,
   ``return-back{''} rather than ``stay-on{''} policy) for
   high-availability. The effect of the VMM rejuvenation technique on the
   expected number of transactions lost is also studied by combining the
   availability model with an M/M/1/n queueing model. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) are important tools for genome engineering.
   Despite intense interest by many academic groups, the lack of robust
   noncommercial methods has hindered their widespread use. The modular
   assembly (MA) of ZFNs from publicly available one-finger archives
   provides a rapid method to create proteins that can recognize a very
   broad spectrum of DNA sequences. However, three-and four-finger arrays
   often fail to produce active nucleases. Efforts to improve the
   specificity of the one-finger archives have not increased the success
   rate above 25\%, suggesting that the MA method might be inherently
   inefficient due to its insensitivity to context-dependent effects. Here
   we present the first systematic study on the effect of array length on
   ZFN activity. ZFNs composed of six-finger MA arrays produced mutations
   at 15 of 21 (71\%) targeted loci in human and mouse cells. A novel
   drop-out linker scheme was used to rapidly assess three-to six-finger
   combinations, demonstrating that shorter arrays could improve activity
   in some cases. Analysis of 268 array variants revealed that half of MA
   ZFNs of any array composition that exceed an ab initio B-score cutoff of
   15 were active. These results suggest that, when used appropriately, MA
   ZFNs are able to target more DNA sequences with higher success rates
   than other current methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Topical chemotherapy for urothelial cancer is
   dependent on adequate contact time of the chemotherapeutic agent with
   the urothelium. To date, there has not been a reliable method of
   maintaining this contact for renal or ureteral urothelial carcinoma. We
   evaluated the safety and feasibility of using a reverse thermosensitive
   polymer to improve dwell times of mitomycin C (MMC) in the upper tract.
   Materials and Methods: Using a porcine model, four animals were treated
   ureteroscopically with both upper urinary tracts receiving MMC mixed
   with iodinated contrast. One additional animal received MMC
   percutaneously. The treatment side had ureteral outflow blocked with a
   reverse thermosensitive polymer plug. MMC dwell time was monitored
   fluoroscopically and intrarenal pressures measured. Two animals were
   euthanized immediately, and three animals were euthanized 5 days
   afterward.
   Results: In control kidneys, drainage occurred at a mean of 5.3 +/- 0.58
   minutes. Intrarenal pressures stayed fairly stable: 9.7 +/- 14.0 cm
   H(2)0. In treatment kidneys, dwell time was extended to 60 minutes, when
   the polymer was washed out. Intrarenal pressures in the treatment
   kidneys peaked at 75.0 +/- 14.7 cm H(2)0 and reached steady state at 60
   cm H(2)0. Pressures normalized after washout of the polymer with cool
   saline. Average washout time was 11.8 +/- 9.6 minutes. No
   histopathologic differences were seen between the control and treatment
   kidneys, or with immediate compared with delayed euthanasia.
   Conclusions: A reverse thermosensitive polymer can retain MMC in the
   upper urinary tract and appears to be safe from our examination of
   intrarenal pressures and histopathology. This technique may improve the
   efficacy of topical chemotherapy in the management of upper tract
   urothelial carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory tests on the micro scale are reported in which two amorphous
   silica cubes were compressed in a liquid environment, in solutions with
   different silica ion concentrations, for up to 3 weeks. Such an
   arrangement represents an idealised representation of two sand grains.
   The grain surfaces and asperities were examined in the scanning electron
   microscope and atomic force microscope (AFM) for fractures, silica gel
   growth and polymer strength. In 500 ppm solution, silica gel structures
   a few hundred micrometres long appeared between stressed silica cubes.
   In 200 ppm solution, silica deposits were found around damaged grain
   surfaces, while at 90 ppm (below silica solubility in neutral pH),
   fibres a few micrometres in length were found growing in cube cracks.
   AFM pulling tests found polymers with strength of the order of 100 nN.
   It was concluded that prolonged compression produced damage in grains,
   raising local silicon ion concentration and accelerating precipitation,
   polymerisation and gelation of silica on grain surfaces, enhancing soil
   strength at the micro scale, and hence most likely contributing to the
   ageing phenomenon observed at the macro scale.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol size distribution (ambient and dried) and chemical composition
   were measured simultaneously using two Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers
   (SMPSs) and filters during the pre-monsoon season (April June 2009) at
   two locations in Central Nepal: Dhulikhel, an urban site in the
   Kathmandu valley, and Besisahar, a rural village in the Marsyangdi
   valley. Diameter growth factors (DGF) were estimated using the larger
   mode (around 100 nm) of the aerosol size distributions. The measured DGF
   suggest that the aerosols were in metastable state below 80\% RH owing
   to the strong diurnal cycle of relative humidity (RH) at Dhulikhel,
   while no discernible growth was observed for Besisahar. Assuming ideal
   behavior of water-soluble organic compounds and using their fraction as
   determined by water extraction of filters produced the best agreement
   for a two-component hygroscopic growth model with the observed DGFs.
   This finding together with the DGF and chemical composition data were
   used to determine the aerosol bulk hygroscopicity parameter, kappa. The
   kappa parameter suggests that aerosols in this region are less
   hygroscopic than aerosols reported in previous studies from other
   regions. The estimated K and the vertically scaled aerosol size
   distribution were then used to estimate the CCN spectra. These are the
   first estimates of CCN spectra from ground-based observations for the
   Central Himalaya region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new notion of typical sequences on a wide class of
   abstract alphabets (so-called standard Borel spaces), which is based on
   approximations of memoryless sources by empirical distributions
   uniformly over a class of measurable ``test functions.{''} In the
   finite-alphabet case, we can take all uniformly bounded functions and
   recover the usual notion of strong typicality (or typicality under the
   total variation distance). For a general alphabet, however, this
   function class turns out to be too large, and must be restricted. With
   this in mind, we define typicality with respect to any Glivenko-Cantelli
   function class (i.e., a function class that admits a Uniform Law of
   Large Numbers) and demonstrate its power by giving simple derivations of
   the fundamental limits on the achievable rates in several source coding
   scenarios, in which the relevant operational criteria pertain to
   reproducing empirical averages of a general-alphabet stationary
   memoryless source with respect to a suitable function class.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a patient study conducted to assess the
   performance of two novel imaging methods, namely short-lag spatial
   coherence (SLSC) and harmonic spatial coherence imaging (HSCI), in an in
   vivo liver environment. Similar in appearance to the B-mode images, SLSC
   and HSCI images are based solely on the spatial coherence of fundamental
   and harmonic echo data, respectively, and do not depend on the echo
   magnitude. SLSC and HSCI suppress incoherent echo signals and thus tend
   to reduce clutter. The SLSC and HSCI images of 17 patients demonstrated
   sharper delineation of blood vessel walls, suppressed clutter inside the
   vessel lumen, and showed reduced speckle in surrounding tissue compared
   to matched B-modes. Target contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
   show statistically significant improvements between fundamental B-mode
   and SLSC imaging and between harmonic B-mode and HSCI imaging (in all
   cases p < 0.001). The magnitude of improvement in contrast and CNR
   increases as the overall quality of B-mode images decreases.
   Poor-quality fundamental B-mode images (where image quality
   classification is based on both contrast and CNR) exhibit the highest
   improvements in both contrast and CNR (288\% improvement in contrast and
   533\% improvement in CNR). (E-mail: marko.jakovljevic@duke.edu) (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Coculture of endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in
   vitro can yield confluent monolayers or EC networks. Factors influencing
   this transition are not known. In this study, we examined whether the
   spatial arrangement of EC-SMC cocultures affected EC migration, network
   morphology, and angiogenic protein secretion. Human umbilical cord
   blood-derived ECs (hCB-ECs) were grown in coculture with human aortic
   SMCs in either a mixed or lamellar spatial geometry and analyzed over a
   culture period of 12 days. The hCB-ECs cultured on SMCs in a mixed
   system had higher cell speeds, shorter persistence times, and lower
   random motility coefficients than ECs in a lamellar system. By day 12 of
   coculture, mixed systems demonstrated greater anastomoses and capillary
   loop formation than lamellar systems as evidenced by a higher number of
   branch points, angle of curvature between branch points, and percentage
   of imaged area covered by networks. The network morphology was more
   uniform in the mixed systems than the lamellar systems with fewer EC
   clusters present after several days in culture. Proliferation of hCB-ECs
   was higher for mixed cocultures during the first 24 h of coculture, and
   then declined dramatically suggesting that proliferation only
   contributed to network formation during the early stages of coculture.
   Proteome assay results show reduced solution levels, but no change in
   intracellular levels of angiogenic proteins in lamellar systems compared
   to mixed systems. These data suggest that mixing ECs and SMCs together
   favors the formation of EC networks to a greater extent than a lamellar
   arrangement in which ECs form a cell layer above a confluent, quiescent
   layer of SMCs.}},

   biology, engineering, and medicine, have the capacity to improve
   outcomes for cardiac patients by providing living cells and degradable
   biomaterials that can regenerate the native myocardium. With an ultimate
   goal of both delivering cells and providing mechanical support to the
   healing heart, we designed three-dimensional (3D) elastomeric scaffolds
   with (1) stiffnesses and anisotropy mimicking explanted myocardial
   specimens as predicted by finite- element (FE) modeling, (2)
   systematically varied combinations of rectangular pore pattern, pore
   aspect ratio, and strut width, and (3) structural features approaching
   tissue scale. Based on predicted mechanical properties, three scaffold
   designs were selected from eight candidates for fabrication from
   poly(glycerol sebacate) by micromolding from silicon wafers. Large 20 x
   20 mm scaffolds with high aspect ratio features (5:1 strut height: strut
   width) were reproducibly cast, cured, and demolded at a relatively high
   throughput. Empirically measured mechanical properties demonstrated that
   scaffolds were cardiac mimetic and validated FE model predictions.
   Two-layered scaffolds providing fully interconnected pore networks were
   fabricated by layer-by- layer assembly. C2C12 myoblasts cultured on
   one-layered scaffolds exhibited specific patterns of cell elongation and
   interconnectivity that appeared to be guided by the scaffold pore
   pattern. Neonatal rat heart cells cultured on two-layered scaffolds for
   1 week were contractile, both spontaneously and in response to
   electrical stimulation, and expressed sarcomeric alpha-actinin, a
   cardiac biomarker. This work not only demonstrated several scaffold
   designs that promoted functional assembly of rat heart cells, but also
   provided the foundation for further computational and empirical
   investigations of 3D elastomeric scaffolds for cardiac tissue
   engineering.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{A brain-to-brain interface (BTBI) enabled a real-time transfer of
   behaviorally meaningful sensorimotor information between the brains of
   two rats. In this BTBI, an ``encoder{''} rat performed sensorimotor
   tasks that required it to select from two choices of tactile or visual
   stimuli. While the encoder rat performed the task, samples of its
   cortical activity were transmitted to matching cortical areas of a
   ``decoder{''} rat using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). The
   decoder rat learned to make similar behavioral selections, guided solely
   by the information provided by the encoder rat's brain. These results
   demonstrated that a complex system was formed by coupling the animals'
   brains, suggesting that BTBIs can enable dyads or networks of animal's
   brains to exchange, process, and store information and, hence, serve as
   the basis for studies of novel types of social interaction and for
   biological computing devices.}},

Title = {{Low Concentrations of Silver Nanoparticles in Biosolids Cause Adverse
   Ecosystem Responses under Realistic Field Scenario}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{A large fraction of engineered nanomaterials in consumer and commercial
   products will reach natural ecosystems. To date, research on the
   biological impacts of environmental nanomaterial exposures has largely
   focused on high-concentration exposures in mechanistic lab studies with
   single strains of model organisms. These results are difficult to
   extrapolate to ecosystems, where exposures will likely be at
   low-concentrations and which are inhabited by a diversity of organisms.
   Here we show adverse responses of plants and microorganisms in a
   replicated long-term terrestrial mesocosm field experiment following a
   single low dose of silver nanoparticles (0.14 mg Ag kg(-1) soil) applied
   via a likely route of exposure, sewage biosolid application. While total
   aboveground plant biomass did not differ between treatments receiving
   biosolids, one plant species, Microstegium vimeneum, had 32 \% less
   biomass in the Slurry+AgNP treatment relative to the Slurry only
   treatment. Microorganisms were also affected by AgNP treatment, which
   gave a significantly different community composition of bacteria in the
   Slurry+AgNPs as opposed to the Slurry treatment one day after addition
   as analyzed by T-RFLP analysis of 16S-rRNA genes. After eight days, N2O
   flux was 4.5 fold higher in the Slurry+AgNPs treatment than the Slurry
   treatment. After fifty days, community composition and N2O flux of the
   Slurry+AgNPs treatment converged with the Slurry. However, the soil
   microbial extracellular enzymes leucine amino peptidase and phosphatase
   had 52 and 27\% lower activities, respectively, while microbial biomass
   was 35\% lower than the Slurry. We also show that the magnitude of these
   responses was in all cases as large as or larger than the positive
   control, AgNO3, added at 4-fold the Ag concentration of the silver
   nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The rat somatosensory system contains multiple thalamocortical loops
   (TCLs) that altogether process, in fundamentally different ways, tactile
   stimuli delivered passively or actively sampled. To elucidate potential
   top-down mechanisms that govern TCL processing in awake, behaving
   animals, we simultaneously recorded neuronal ensemble activity across
   multiple cortical and thalamic areas while rats performed an active
   aperture discrimination task. Single neurons located in the primary
   somatosensory cortex (S1), the ventroposterior medial, and the posterior
   medial thalamic nuclei of the trigeminal somatosensory pathways
   exhibited prominent anticipatory firing modulations before the whiskers
   touching the aperture edges. This cortical and thalamic anticipatory
   firing could not be explained by whisker movements or whisker
   stimulation, because neither trigeminal ganglion sensory-evoked
   responses nor EMG activity were detected during the same period. Both
   thalamic and S1 anticipatory activity were predictive of the animal's
   discrimination accuracy. Inactivation of the primary motor cortex (M1)
   with muscimol affected anticipatory patterns in S1 and the thalamus, and
   impaired the ability to predict the animal's performance accuracy based
   on thalamocortical anticipatory activity. These findings suggest that
   neural processing in TCLs is launched in anticipation of whisker contact
   with objects, depends on top-down effects generated in part by M1
   activity, and cannot be explained by the classical feedforward model of
   the rat trigeminal system.}},

Abstract = {{Marshes display impressive biogeomorphic features, such as zonation, a
   mosaic of extensive vegetation patches of rather uniform composition,
   exhibiting sharp transitions in the presence of extremely small
   topographic gradients. Although generally associated with the accretion
   processes necessary for marshes to keep up with relative sea level rise,
   competing environmental constraints, and ecologic controls, zonation is
   still poorly understood in terms of the underlying biogeomorphic
   mechanisms. Here we find, through observations and modeling
   interpretation, that zonation is the result of coupled
   geomorphological-biological dynamics and that it stems from the ability
   of vegetation to actively engineer the landscape by tuning soil
   elevation within preferential ranges of optimal adaptation. We find
   multiple peaks in the frequency distribution of observed topographic
   elevation and identify them as the signature of biologic controls on
   geomorphodynamics through competing stable states modulated by the
   interplay of inorganic and organic deposition. Interestingly, the stable
   biogeomorphic equilibria correspond to suboptimal rates of biomass
   production, a result coherent with recent observations. The emerging
   biogeomorphic structures may display varying degrees of robustness to
   changes in the rate of sea level rise and sediment availability, with
   implications for the overall resilience of marsh ecosystems to climatic
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Peptide drugs are an exciting class of pharmaceuticals increasingly used
   for the treatment of a variety of diseases; however, their main drawback
   is a short half-life, which dictates multiple and frequent injections
   and an undesirable ``peak-and-valley{''} pharmacokinetic profile, which
   can cause undesirable side-effects. Synthetic prolonged release
   formulations can provide extended release of biologically active native
   peptide, but their synthetic nature can be an obstacle to production and
   utilization. Motivated by these limitations, we have developed a new and
   entirely genetically encoded peptide delivery system-Protease Operated
   Depots (PODs)-to provide sustained and tunable release of a peptide drug
   from an injectable s.c. depot. We demonstrate proof-of-concept of PODs,
   by fusion of protease cleavable oligomers of glucagon-like peptide-1, a
   type-2 diabetes drug, and a thermally responsive, depot-forming
   elastin-like-polypeptide that undergoes a thermally triggered inverse
   phase transition below body temperature, thereby forming an injectable
   depot. We constructed synthetic genes for glucagon-like peptide-1 PODs
   and demonstrated their high-yield expression in Escherichia coli and
   facile purification by a nonchromatographic scheme we had previously
   developed. Remarkably, a single injection of glucagon-like peptide-1
   PODs was able to reduce blood glucose levels in mice for up to 5 d, 120
   times longer than an injection of the native peptide drug. These
   findings demonstrate that PODs provide the first genetically encoded
   alternative to synthetic peptide encapsulation schemes for sustained

Abstract = {{Aggregation kinetics of chiral-specific semiconducting single-walled
   carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was systematically studied through
   time-resolved dynamic light scattering. Varied monovalent (NaCl) and
   divalent (CaCl2) electrolyte composition was used as background solution
   chemistry. Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) was used to study the
   effects of natural organic matter on chirally separated SWNT
   aggregation. Increasing salt concentration and introduction of divalent
   cations caused aggregation of SWNT clusters by suppressing the
   electrostatic repulsive interaction from the oxidized surfaces. The
   (6,5) SWNTs, i.e., SG65, with relatively lower diameter tubes compared
   to (7,6), i.e., SG76, showed substantially higher stability (7- and
   5-fold for NaCl and CaCl2, respectively). The critical coagulation
   concentration (CCC) values were 96 and 13 mM NaCl in the case of NaCl
   and 2.8 and 0.6 mM CaCl2 for SG65 and SG76, respectively. The increased
   tube diameter for (7,6) armchair SWNTs likely presented with higher van
   der Waals interaction and thus increased the aggregation propensity
   substantially. The presence of SRHA enhanced SWNT stability in divalent
   CaCl2 environment through steric interaction from adsorbed humic
   molecules; however showed little or no effects for monovalent NaCl. The
   mechanism of aggregation describing favorable interaction tendencies for
   (7,6) SWNTs is probed through ab initio molecular modeling. The results
   suggest that SWNT stability can be chirality dependent in typical
   aquatic environment.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury stable isotope abundances were used to trace transport of
   Hg-impacted river sediment near a coal ash spill at Harriman, Tennessee,
   USA. delta Hg-202 values for Kingston coal ash released into the Emory
   River in 2008 are significantly negative (-1.78 +/- 0.35 parts per
   thousand), whereas sediments of the Clinch River, into which the Emory
   River flows, are contaminated by an additional Hg source (potentially
   from the Y-12 complex near Oak Ridge, Tennessee) with near-zero values
   (-0.23 +/- 0.16 parts per thousand. Nominally uncontaminated Emory River
   sediments (12 miles upstream from the Emory-Clinch confluence) have
   intermediate values (-1.17 +/- 0.13 parts per thousand) and contain
   lower Hg concentrations. Emory River mile 10 sediments, possibly
   impacted by an old paper mill has delta Hg-202 values of -0.47 +/- 0.04
   parts per thousand. A mixing model, using delta Hg-202 values and Hg
   concentrations, yielded estimates of the relative contributions of coal
   ash, Clinch River, and Emory River sediments for a suite of 71 sediment
   samples taken over a 30 month time period from 13 locations. Emory River
   samples, with two exceptions, are unaffected by Clinch River sediment,
   despite occasional upstream flow from the Clinch River. As expected,
   Clinch River sediment below its confluence with the Emory River are
   affected by Kingston coal ash; however, the relative contribution of the
   coal ash varies among sampling sites.}},

Abstract = {{The Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston coal ash spill in December 2008
   deposited approximately 4.1 million m(3) of fly ash and bottom ash into
   the Emory and Clinch River system (Harriman, Tennessee, USA). The
   objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the ash on
   surface water and sediment quality over an eighteen month period after
   the spill, with a specific focus on mercury and methylmercury in
   sediments. Our results indicated that surface water quality was not
   impaired with respect to total mercury concentrations. However, in the
   sediments of the Emory River near the coal ash spill, total mercury
   concentrations were 3- to 4-times greater than sediments several miles
   upstream of the ash spill. Similarly, methylmercury content in the Emory
   and Clinch River sediments near the ash spill were slightly elevated (up
   to a factor of 3) at certain locations compared to upstream sediments.
   Up to 2\% of the total mercury in sediments containing coal ash was
   present as methylmercury. Mercury isotope composition and sediment
   geochemical data suggested that elevated methylmercury concentrations
   occurred in regions where native sediments were mixed with coal ash
   (e.g., less than 28\% as coal ash in the Emory River). This coal ash may
   have provided substrates (such as sulfate) that stimulated
   biomethylation of mercury. The production of methylmercury in these
   areas is a concern because this neurotoxic organomercury compound can be
   highly bioaccumulative. Future risk assessments of coal ash spills
   should consider not only the leaching potential of mercury from the
   wastes but also the potential for methylmercury production in receiving
   waters.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2208-2215}},

Abstract = {{This report describes the development of elastomeric capture
   microparticles (EC mu Ps) and their use with acoustophoretic separation
   to perform microparticle assays via flow cytometry. We have developed
   simple methods to form EC mu Ps by cross-linking droplets of common
   commercially available silicone precursors in suspension followed by
   surface functionalization with biomolecular recognition reagents. The EC
   mu Ps are compressible particles that exhibit negative acoustic contrast
   in ultrasound when suspended in aqueous media, blood serum, or diluted
   blood. In this study, these particles have been functionalized with
   antibodies to bind prostate specific antigen and immunoglobulin (IgG).
   Specific separation of the EC mu Ps from blood cells is achieved by
   flowing them through a microfluidic acoustophoretic device that uses an
   ultrasonic standing wave to align the blood cells, which exhibit
   positive acoustic contrast, at a node in the acoustic pressure
   distribution while aligning the negative acoustic contrast EC mu Ps at
   the antinodes. Laminar flow of the separated particles to downstream
   collection ports allows for collection of the separated negative
   contrast (EC mu Ps) and positive contrast particles (cells). Separated
   EC mu Ps were analyzed via flow cytometry to demonstrate nanomolar
   detection for prostate specific antigen in aqueous buffer and picomolar
   detection for IgG in plasma and diluted blood samples. This approach has
   potential applications in the development of rapid assays that detect
   the presence of low concentrations of biomarkers in a number of
   biological sample types.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Using only dimensional considerations, Monin and Obukhov proposed a
   ``universal{''} stability correction function phi(c)(zeta) that accounts
   for distortions caused by thermal stratification to the mean scalar
   concentration profile in the atmospheric surface layer when the flow is
   stationary, planar homogeneous, fully turbulent, and lacking any
   subsidence. For nearly 6 decades, their analysis provided the basic
   framework for almost all operational models and data interpretation in
   the lower atmosphere. However, the canonical shape of phi(c)(zeta) and
   the departure from the Reynold's analogy continue to defy theoretical
   explanation. Here, the basic processes governing the scalar-velocity
   cospectrum, including buoyancy and the scaling laws describing the
   velocity and temperature spectra, are considered via a simplified
   cospectral budget. The solution to this cospectral budget is then used
   to derive phi(c)(zeta), thereby establishing a link between the
   energetics of turbulent velocity and scalar concentration fluctuations
   and the bulk flow describing the mean scalar concentration profile. The
   resulting theory explains all the canonical features of phi(c)(zeta),
   including the onset of power laws for various stability regimes and
   their concomitant exponents, as well as the causes of departure from
   Reynold's analogy. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.023004}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that stone comminution decreases with
   increased pulse repetition frequency as a result of bubble proliferation
   in the cavitation field of a shock wave lithotripter (Pishchalnikov et
   al 2011 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 130 EL87-93). If cavitation nuclei remain in
   the propagation path of successive lithotripter pulses, especially in
   the acoustic coupling cushion of the shock wave source, they will
   consume part of the incident wave energy, leading to reduced tensile
   pressure in the focal region and thus lower stone comminution
   efficiency. We introduce a method to remove cavitation nuclei from the
   coupling cushion between successive shock exposures using a jet of
   degassed water. As a result, pre-focal bubble nuclei lifetime quantified
   by B-mode ultrasound imaging was reduced from 7 to 0.3 s by a jet with
   an exit velocity of 62 cm s(-1). Stone fragmentation (percent mass <2
   mm) after 250 shocks delivered at 1 Hz was enhanced from 22 +/- 6\% to
   33 +/- 5\% (p = 0.007) in water without interposing tissue mimicking
   materials. Stone fragmentation after 500 shocks delivered at 2 Hz was
   increased from 18 +/- 6\% to 28 +/- 8\% (p = 0.04) with an interposing
   tissue phantom of 8 cm thick. These results demonstrate the critical
   influence of cavitation bubbles in the coupling cushion on stone
   comminution and suggest a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of
   contemporary shock wave lithotripters.}},

Abstract = {{As the use of engineered nanomaterials becomes more prevalent, the
   likelihood of unintended exposure to these materials also increases.
   Given the current scarcity of experimental data regarding fate,
   transport, and bioavailability, determining potential environmental
   exposure to these materials requires an in depth analysis of modeling
   techniques that can be used in both the near- and long-term. Here, we
   provide a critical review of traditional and emerging exposure modeling
   approaches to highlight the challenges that scientists and
   decision-makers face when developing environmental exposure and risk
   assessments for nanomaterials. We find that accounting for nanospecific
   properties, overcoming data gaps, realizing model limitations, and
   handling uncertainty are key to developing informative and reliable
   environmental exposure and risk assessments for engineered
   nanomaterials. We find methods suited to recognizing and addressing
   significant uncertainty to be most appropriate for near-term
   environmental exposure modeling, given the current state of information
   and the current insufficiency of established deterministic models to
   address environmental exposure to engineered nanomaterials.}},

Title = {{Genipin-Crosslinked Cartilage-Derived Matrix as a Scaffold for Human
   Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Chondrogenesis}},
Journal = {{TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3-4}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Autologous cell-based tissue engineering using three-dimensional
   scaffolds holds much promise for the repair of cartilage defects.
   Previously, we reported on the development of a porous scaffold derived
   solely from native articular cartilage, which can induce human
   adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) to differentiate into a chondrogenic
   phenotype without exogenous growth factors. However, this ASC-seeded
   cartilage-derived matrix (CDM) contracts over time in culture, which may
   limit certain clinical applications. The present study aimed to
   investigate the ability of chemical crosslinking using a natural
   biologic crosslinker, genipin, to prevent scaffold contraction while
   preserving the chondrogenic potential of CDM. CDM scaffolds were
   crosslinked in various genipin concentrations, seeded with ASCs, and
   then cultured for 4 weeks to evaluate the influence of chemical
   crosslinking on scaffold contraction and ASC chondrogenesis. At the
   highest crosslinking degree of 89\%, most cells failed to attach to the
   scaffolds and resulted in poor formation of a new extracellular matrix.
   Scaffolds with a low crosslinking density of 4\% experienced
   cell-mediated contraction similar to our original report on
   noncrosslinked CDM. Using a 0.05\% genipin solution, a crosslinking
   degree of 50\% was achieved, and the ASC-seeded constructs exhibited no
   significant contraction during the culture period. Moreover, expression
   of cartilage-specific genes, synthesis, and accumulation of
   cartilage-related macromolecules and the development of mechanical
   properties were comparable to the original CDM. These findings support
   the potential use of a moderately (i.e., approximately one-half of the
   available lysine or hydroxylysine residues being crosslinked)
   crosslinked CDM as a contraction-free biomaterial for cartilage tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{For many marine organisms, especially large whales that cannot be
   studied in laboratory settings, our ability to obtain basic behavioral
   and physiological data is limited, because these organisms occupy
   offshore habitats and spend a majority of their time underwater. A class
   of multisensor, suction-cup-attached archival tags has revolutionized
   the study of large baleen whales, particularly with respect to the
   predatory strategies used by these gigantic bulk filter feeders to
   exploit abundant oceanic resources. By integrating these data with those
   from other disciplines, researchers have uncovered a diverse and
   extraordinary set of underwater behaviors, ranging from acrobatic diving
   maneuvers to extreme feeding events during Which whales engulf volumes
   of prey-laden water that are much larger than their own body. This
   research framework not only improves our knowledge of the individual
   performance and behavior of these keystone predators but also informs
   our ability to understand the dynamics of complex marine ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Change-Point Detection for High-Dimensional Time Series With Missing
   Data}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{12-27}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel approach to change-point detection when the
   observed high-dimensional data may have missing elements. The
   performance of classical methods for change-point detection typically
   scales poorly with the dimensionality of the data, so that a large
   number of observations are collected after the true change-point before
   it can be reliably detected. Furthermore, missing components in the
   observed data handicap conventional approaches. The proposed method
   addresses these challenges by modeling the dynamic distribution
   underlying the data as lying close to a time-varying low-dimensional
   submanifold embedded within the ambient observation space. Specifically,
   streaming data is used to track a submanifold approximation, measure
   deviations from this approximation, and calculate a series of statistics
   of the deviations for detecting when the underlying manifold has changed
   in a sharp or unexpected manner. The approach described in this paper
   leverages several recent results in the field of high-dimensional data
   analysis, including subspace tracking with missing data, multiscale
   analysis techniques for point clouds, online optimization, and
   change-point detection performance analysis. Simulations and experiments
   highlight the robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach in
   detecting an abrupt change in an otherwise slowly varying
   low-dimensional manifold.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1123-1136}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Natural mixed ecosystems (grass and woody vegetation) and managed
   grasslands are the dominant contrasting ecosystems of semiarid regions.
   These two types of land covers are known to differ in their responses to
   water stress, as the trees demonstrate both greater stress resistance
   and greater ability to tap into deeper water sources. In this study, the
   contrasting influences of vegetation differences (grassland versus mixed
   ecosystems) and soil differences (deeper alluvial valley soils versus
   shallow upland soils) on evapotranspiration (ET) and CO2 exchange
   dynamics have been examined. Data from two representative case study
   sites within the Flumendosa river basin on Sardinia were obtained. At
   both sites, land-surface and CO2 fluxes were estimated by eddy
   covariance instruments on micrometeorological towers. Fluxes at the two
   ecosystems were compared, and the effect of the vegetation cover was
   examined with the help of an ecohydrologic model to control for the
   different soil influences. The results show that the water and carbon
   fluxes in these ecosystems are more controlled by soil differences
   during the late spring, when the deeper soil depth leads to a doubling
   of the available moisture and an increase of 48\% in the mixed natural
   vegetation transpiration. The system then switches to vegetation control
   in the summer as the presence or absence of drought-tolerant trees is
   the dominant imprint on continued transpiration and photosynthesis. In
   fact, total grassland ET in the summer is only 20\% as large as the
   mixed vegetation ET in the summer.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sensory neuroprostheses show great potential for alleviating major
   sensory deficits. It is not known, however, whether such devices can
   augment the subject's normal perceptual range. Here we show that adult
   rats can learn to perceive otherwise invisible infrared light through a
   neuroprosthesis that couples the output of a head-mounted infrared
   sensor to their somatosensory cortex (S1) via intracortical
   microstimulation. Rats readily learn to use this new information source,
   and generate active exploratory strategies to discriminate among
   infrared signals in their environment. S1 neurons in these
   infrared-perceiving rats respond to both whisker deflection and
   intracortical microstimulation, suggesting that the infrared
   representation does not displace the original tactile representation.
   Hence, sensory cortical prostheses, in addition to restoring normal
   neurological functions, may serve to expand natural perceptual
   capabilities in mammals.}},

   We describe several variations of the method including a classical
   balancing method with pseudo time relaxation, the nonlinear frequency
   domain form and the time spectral form. We show that the maximum stable
   CourantFriedrichsLewy (CFL) number for explicit schemes is dependent on
   the grid reduced frequency, a non-dimensional parameter that depends on
   the cell size, characteristic wave speed, and the highest frequency
   retained in the harmonic balance analysis. We apply the harmonic balance
   methods to several nonlinear unsteady flow problems and show that even
   strongly nonlinear flows can be modelled accurately with a small number
   of harmonics retained in the model.}},

Abstract = {{Although structural DNA nanotechnology, and especially scaffolded DNA
   origami, hold great promise for bottom-up fabrication of novel nanoscale
   materials and devices, concerns about scalability have tempered
   widespread enthusiasm. Here we report a single-pot reaction where both
   strands of double-stranded M13-bacteriophage DNA are simultaneously
   folded into two distinct shapes that then heterodimerize with high
   yield. The fully addressable, two-dimensional heterodimer DNA origami,
   with twice the surface area of standard M13 origami, formed in high
   yield (81\% of the well-formed monomers undergo dimerization). We also
   report the concurrent production of entire sets of staple strands by a
   unique, nicking strand-displacement amplification (nSDA) involving
   reusable surface-bound template strands that were synthesized in situ
   using a custom piezoelectric inkjet system. The combination of
   chip-based staple strand production, double-sized origami, and
   high-yield one-pot assembly markedly increases the useful scale of DNA
   origami.}},

Abstract = {{Cell therapies are potential alternatives to organ transplantation for
   liver failure or dysfunction but are compromised by inefficient
   engraftment, cell dispersal to ectopic sites, and emboli formation.
   Grafting strategies have been devised for transplantation of human
   hepatic stem cells (hHpSCs) embedded into a mix of soluble signals and
   extracellular matrix biomaterials (hyaluronans, type III collagen,
   laminin) found in stem cell niches. The hHpSCs maintain a stable stem
   cell phenotype under the graft conditions. The grafts were transplanted
   into the livers of immunocompromised murine hosts with and without
   carbon tetrachloride treatment to assess the effects of quiescent versus
   injured liver conditions. Grafted cells remained localized to the
   livers, resulting in a larger bolus of engrafted cells in the host
   livers under quiescent conditions and with potential for more rapid
   expansion under injured liver conditions. By contrast, transplantation
   by direct injection or via a vascular route resulted in inefficient
   engraftment and cell dispersal to ectopic sites. Transplantation by
   grafting is proposed as a preferred strategy for cell therapies for
   solid organs such as the liver. (HEPATOLOGY 2013;57:775-785)}},

Abstract = {{With appropriate geometry configurations, bistatic Synthetic Aperture
   Radar (SAR) can break through the limitations of monostatic SAR for
   forward-looking imaging. Thanks to such a capability, bistatic
   forward-looking SAR (BFSAR) has extensive potential applications. This
   paper develops a frequency-domain imaging algorithm for translational
   invariant BFSAR. The algorithm uses the method of Lengendre polynomials
   expansion to compute the two dimensional point target reference
   spectrum, and this spectrum is used to perform the range cell migration
   correction (RCMC), secondary range compression and azimuth compression.
   In particular, the Doppler-centroid and bistatic-range dependent
   interpolation for residual RCMC is presented in detail. In addition, a
   method that combines the ambiguity and resolution theories to determine
   the forward-looking imaging swath is also presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Although numerous studies have addressed the effects of ACL injury and
   reconstruction on knee joint motion, there is currently little data
   available describing in vivo ACL strain during activities of daily
   living. Data describing in vivo ACL strain during activities such as
   gait is critical to understanding the biomechanical function of the
   ligament, and ultimately, to improving the surgical treatment of
   patients with ACL rupture. Thus, our objective was to characterize the
   relative strain in the ACL during both the stance and swing phases of
   normal level walking. Eight normal subjects were recruited for this
   study. Through a combination of magnetic resonance imaging, biplanar
   fluoroscopy, and motion capture, we created in vivo models of each
   subject's normal walking movements to measure knee flexion, ACL length,
   and relative ACL strain during gait. Regression analysis demonstrated an
   inverse relationship between knee flexion and ACL length (R-2=0.61,
   p<0.001). Furthermore, relative strain in the ACL peaked at 13 +/- 2\%
   (mean +/- 95\%Cl) during mid-stance when the knee was near full
   extension. Additionally, there was a second local maximum of 10 +/- 7\%
   near the end of swing phase, just prior to heel strike. These data are a
   vital step in further comprehending the normal in vivo biomechanics
   experienced by the ACL. In the future, this information could prove
   critical to improving ACL reconstruction and provide useful validation
   to future computational models investigating ACL function. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Due to the biphasic viscoelastic nature of cartilage, joint loading may
   result in deformations that require times on the order of hours to fully
   recover. Thus, cartilaginous tissues may exhibit cumulative strain over
   the course of each day. The goal of this study was to assess the
   magnitude and spatial distribution of strain in the articular cartilage
   of the knee with daily activity. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 10
   asymptomatic subjects (six males and four females) with mean age of 29
   years were obtained at 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM on the same day using a 3T
   magnet. These images were used to create 3D models of the femur, tibia,
   and patella from which cartilage thickness distributions were
   quantified. Cartilage thickness generally decreased from AM to PM in all
   areas except the patellofemoral groove and was associated with
   significant compressive strains in the medial condyle and tibial
   plateau. From AM to PM, cartilage of the medial tibial plateau exhibited
   a compressive strain of -5.1 +/- 1.0\% (mean +/- SEM) averaged over all
   locations, while strains in the lateral plateau were slightly lower (
   -3.1 +/- 0.6\%). Femoral cartilage showed an average strain of -1.9 +/-
   0.6\%. The findings of this study show that human knee cartilage
   undergoes diurnal changes in strain that vary with site in the joint.
   Since abnormal joint loading can be detrimental to cartilage
   homeostasis, these data provide a baseline for future studies
   investigating the effects of altered biomechanics on diurnal cartilage
   strains and cartilage physiology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix (ECM) of articular cartilage is structurally
   and mechanically inhomogeneous and anisotropic, exhibiting variations in
   composition, collagen fiber architecture, and pericellular matrix (PCM)
   morphology among the different zones (superficial, middle, and deep).
   Joint loading exposes chondrocytes to a complex biomechanical
   environment, as the microscale mechanical environment of the chondrocyte
   depends on the relative properties of its PCM and local ECM. ECM
   anisotropy and chondrocyte deformation are influenced by the split-line
   direction, the preferred collagen fiber orientation parallel to the
   articular surface. While previous studies have demonstrated that
   cartilage macroscale properties vary with depth and the direction of
   loading relative to the split-line direction, the potential anisotropic
   behavior of the ECM and PCM at the microscale has yet to be examined.
   The goal of this study was to characterize the depth and directional
   dependence of the microscale biomechanical properties of porcine
   cartilage ECM and PCM in situ. Cartilage was cryosectioned to generate
   samples oriented parallel and perpendicular to the split-line direction
   and normal to the articular surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based
   stiffness mapping was utilized to measure ECM and PCM microscale elastic
   properties in all three directions within each zone. Distinct anisotropy
   in ECM elastic moduli was observed in the superficial and deep zones,
   while the middle zone exhibited subtle anisotropy. PCM elastic moduli
   exhibited zonal uniformity with depth and directional dependence when
   pooled across the zones. These findings provide new evidence for
   mechanical inhomogeneity and anisotropy at the microscale in articular
   cartilage. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Genome-wide fitness is an emerging type of high-throughput
   biological data generated for individual organisms by creating libraries
   of knockouts, subjecting them to broad ranges of environmental
   conditions, and measuring the resulting clone-specific fitnesses. Since
   fitness is an organism-scale measure of gene regulatory network
   behaviour, it may offer certain advantages when insights into such
   phenotypical and functional features are of primary interest over
   individual gene expression. Previous works have shown that genome-wide
   fitness data can be used to uncover novel gene regulatory interactions,
   when compared with results of more conventional gene expression
   analysis. Yet, to date, few algorithms have been proposed for
   systematically using genome-wide mutant fitness data for gene regulatory
   network inference.
   Results: In this article, we describe a model and propose an inference
   algorithm for using fitness data from knockout libraries to identify
   underlying gene regulatory networks. Unlike most prior methods, the
   presented approach captures not only structural, but also dynamical and
   non-linear nature of biomolecular systems involved. A state-space model
   with non-linear basis is used for dynamically describing gene regulatory
   networks. Network structure is then elucidated by estimating unknown
   model parameters. Unscented Kalman filter is used to cope with the
   non-linearities introduced in the model, which also enables the
   algorithm to run in on-line mode for practical use. Here, we demonstrate
   that the algorithm provides satisfying results for both synthetic data
   as well as empirical measurements of GAL network in yeast Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae and TyrR-LiuR network in bacteria Shewanella oneidensis.}},

Title = {{The effect of averaging adjacent planes for artifact reduction in matrix
   inversion tomosynthesis}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Matrix inversion tomosynthesis (MITS) uses linear systems
   theory and knowledge of the imaging geometry to remove tomographic blur
   that is present in conventional backprojection tomosynthesis
   reconstructions, leaving in-plane detail rendered clearly. The use of
   partial-pixel interpolation during the backprojection process introduces
   imprecision in the MITS modeling of tomographic blur, and creates
   low-contrast artifacts in some MITS planes. This paper examines the use
   of MITS slabs, created by averaging several adjacent MITS planes, as a
   method for suppressing partial-pixel artifacts.
   Methods: Human chest tomosynthesis projection data, acquired as part of
   an IRB-approved pilot study, were used to generate MITS planes,
   three-plane MITS slabs (MITSa3), five-plane MITS slabs (MITSa5), and
   seven-plane MITS slabs (MITSa7). These were qualitatively examined for
   partial-pixel artifacts and the visibility of normal and abnormal
   anatomy. Additionally, small (5 mm) subtle pulmonary nodules were
   simulated and digitally super-imposed upon human chest tomosynthesis
   projection images, and their visibility was qualitatively assessed in
   the different reconstruction techniques. Simulated images of a thin wire
   were used to generate modulation transfer function (MTF) and
   slice-sensitivity profile curves for the different MITS and MITS slab
   techniques, and these were examined for indications of partial-pixel
   artifacts and frequency response uniformity. Finally, mean-subtracted,
   exposure-normalized noise power spectra (ENNPS) estimates were computed
   and compared for MITS and MITS slab reconstructions, generated from 10
   sets of tomosynthesis projection data of an acrylic slab. The simulated
   in-plane MTF response of each technique was also combined with the
   square root of the ENNPS estimate to yield stochastic signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) information about the different reconstruction techniques.
   Results: For scan angles of 20 degrees and 5 mm plane separation, seven
   MITS planes must be averaged to sufficiently remove partial-pixel
   artifacts. MITSa7 does appear to subtly reduce the contrast of
   high-frequency ``edge{''} information, but the removal of partial-pixel
   artifacts makes the appearance of low-contrast, fine-detail anatomy even
   more conspicuous in MITSa7 slices. MITSa7 also appears to render
   simulated subtle 5 mm pulmonary nodules with greater visibility than
   MITS alone, in both the open lung and regions overlying the mediastinum.
   Finally, the MITSa7 technique reduces stochastic image variance, though
   the in-plane stochastic SNR (for very thin objects which do not span
   multiple MITS planes) is only improved at spatial frequencies between
   0.05 and 0.20 cycles/mm.
   Conclusions: The MITSa7 method is an improvement over traditional
   single-plane MITS for thoracic imaging and the pulmonary nodule
   detection task, and thus the authors plan to use the MITSa7 approach for
   all future MITS research at the authors' institution. (c) 2013 American

Title = {{A comparison of radial keyhole strategies for high spatial and temporal
   resolution 4D contrast-enhanced MRI in small animal tumor models}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI has been widely used as a
   quantitative imaging method for monitoring tumor response to therapy.
   The simultaneous challenges of increasing temporal and spatial
   resolution in a setting where the signal from the much smaller voxel is
   weaker have made this MR technique difficult to implement in
   small-animal imaging. Existing protocols employed in preclinical DCE-MRI
   acquire a limited number of slices resulting in potentially lost
   information in the third dimension. This study describes and compares a
   family of four-dimensional (3D spatial + time), projection acquisition,
   radial keyhole-sampling strategies that support high spatial and
   temporal resolution.
   Methods: The 4D method is based on a RF-spoiled, steady-state,
   gradient-recalled sequence with minimal echo time. An interleaved 3D
   radial trajectory with a quasi-uniform distribution of points in k-space
   was used for sampling temporally resolved datasets. These volumes were
   reconstructed with three different k-space filters encompassing a range
   of possible radial keyhole strategies. The effect of k-space filtering
   on spatial and temporal resolution was studied in a 5 mM CuSO4 phantom
   consisting of a meshgrid with 350-mu m spacing and in 12 tumors from
   three cell lines (HT-29, LoVo, MX-1) and a primary mouse sarcoma model
   (three tumors/group). The time-to-peak signal intensity was used to
   assess the effect of the reconstruction filters on temporal resolution.
   As a measure of heterogeneity in the third dimension, the authors
   analyzed the spatial distribution of the rate of transport (K-trans) of
   the contrast agent across the endothelium barrier for several different
   types of tumors.
   Results: Four-dimensional radial keyhole imaging does not degrade the
   system spatial resolution. Phantom studies indicate there is a maximum
   40\% decrease in signal-to-noise ratio as compared to a fully sampled
   dataset. T1 measurements obtained with the interleaved radial technique
   do not differ significantly from those made with a conventional
   Cartesian spin-echo sequence. A bin-by-bin comparison of the
   distribution of the time-to-peak parameter shows that 4D radial keyhole
   reconstruction does not cause significant temporal blurring when a
   temporal resolution of 9.9 s is used for the subsamples of the keyhole
   data. In vivo studies reveal substantial tumor heterogeneity in the
   third spatial dimension that may be missed with lower resolution imaging
   protocols.
   Conclusions: Volumetric keyhole imaging with projection acquisition
   provides a means to increase spatiotemporal resolution and coverage over
   that provided by existing 2D Cartesian protocols. Furthermore, there is
   no difference in temporal resolution between the higher spatial
   resolution keyhole reconstruction and the undersampled projection data.
   The technique allows one to measure complex heterogeneity of kinetic
   parameters with isotropic, microscopic spatial resolution. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{A computational code has been developed for aeroelastic analysis for an
   all-movable horizontal tail, and a companion wind-tunnel test program
   has been conducted. The structural bending and torsional stiffness are
   based upon an experimental tail model that has served as the basis for
   free-play design criteria. A linear three-dimensional time-domain
   vortex-lattice aerodynamic model is used to study the flutter and also
   nonlinear limit-cycle oscillations induced by a free-play gap in the
   actuating mechanism at the root of the tail as well as the effects of
   the root rotation angle (nominal angle of attack) on
   limit-cycle-oscillation response and gravity loads. It is found that the
   root rotation angle, gravity loads, and the initial conditions all
   significantly affect the limit-cycle-oscillation behavior. The computed
   aeroelastic responses are compared with the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the computational cost of large array pattern synthesis is
   attractive in many applications. In this paper, a fast pencil beam
   pattern synthesis method for large nonuniform antenna arrays is
   proposed. This method is based on an interpolation in a least square
   sense and iterative fast Fourier transform (FFT), i.e., interpolate the
   nonuniform distributed elements into uniform virtual elements, and then
   apply FFT to synthesis the uniform array. Thanks to the efficiency of
   FFT, the proposed method is much faster and can handle much larger
   arrays than the existing methods. To guarantee the interpolation
   accuracy, the choice of the interpolation parameters is discussed. Both
   linear and planar nonuniform array examples are shown to validate the
   advantages of the proposed method.}},

   Models}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A framework for adaptive and non-adaptive statistical compressive
   sensing is developed, where a statistical model replaces the standard
   sparsity model of classical compressive sensing. We propose within this
   framework optimal task-specific sensing protocols specifically and
   jointly designed for classification and reconstruction. A two-step
   adaptive sensing paradigm is developed, where online sensing is applied
   to detect the signal class in the first step, followed by a
   reconstruction step adapted to the detected class and the observed
   samples. The approach is based on information theory, here tailored for
   Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), where an information-theoretic objective
   relationship between the sensed signals and a representation of the
   specific task of interest is maximized. Experimental results using
   synthetic signals, Landsat satellite attributes, and natural images of
   different sizes and with different noise levels show the improvements
   achieved using the proposed framework when compared to more standard
   sensing protocols. The underlying formulation can be applied beyond
   GMMs, at the price of higher mathematical and computational complexity.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a significant modification to the Random Demodulator
   (RD) of Tropp et al. for sub-Nyquist sampling of frequency-sparse
   signals. The modification, termed constrained random demodulator,
   involves replacing the random waveform, essential to the operation of
   the RD, with a constrained random waveform that has limits on its
   switching rate because fast switching waveforms may be hard to generate
   cleanly. The result is a relaxation on the hardware requirements with a
   slight, but manageable, decrease in the recovery guarantees. The paper
   also establishes the importance of properly choosing the statistics of
   the constrained random waveform. If the power spectrum of the random
   waveform matches the distribution on the tones of the input signal
   (i.e., the distribution is proportional to the power spectrum), then
   recovery of the input signal tones is improved. The theoretical
   guarantees provided in the paper are validated through extensive
   numerical simulations and phase transition plots.}},

Abstract = {{Triclosan (5-chloro-2-{[}2,4-dichlorophenoxy]phenol) is a relatively
   new, commonly used antimicrobial compound found in many personal care
   products. Triclosan is toxic to marine organisms at the micrograms per
   liter level, can photodegrade to a dioxin, can accumulate in humans, and
   has been found to be stable in marine sediments for over 30 years. To
   determine the effects of triclosan on marine benthic communities, intact
   sediment cores were brought into the laboratory and held under flowing
   seawater conditions. A 2-cm layer of triclosan-spiked sediment was
   applied to the surface, and after a two-week exposure the meio- and
   macrofaunal communities were assessed for differences in composition
   relative to nonspiked cores. A high triclosan treatment (180?mg/kg dry
   wt) affected both the meio- and the macrobenthic communities. There were
   no discernible differences with a low-triclosan treatment (14?mg/kg dry
   wt). This exposure method is effective for testing the benthic community
   response to sediment contaminants, but improvements should be made with
   regard to the amount and method of applying the overlying sediment to
   prevent smothering of fragile benthic organisms. Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

Abstract = {{Carefully timed tandem microbubbles have been shown to produce
   directional and targeted membrane poration of individual cells in
   microfluidic systems, which could be of use in ultrasound-mediated drug
   and gene delivery. This study aims at contributing to the understanding
   of the mechanisms at play in such an interaction. The dynamics of single
   and tandem microbubbles between two parallel plates is studied
   numerically and analytically. Comparisons are then made between the
   numerical results and the available experimental results. Numerically,
   assuming a potential flow, a three-dimensional boundary element method
   (BEM) is used to describe complex bubble deformations, jet formation,
   and bubble splitting. Analytically, compressibility and viscous boundary
   layer effects along the channel walls, neglected in the BEM model, are
   considered while shape of the bubble is not considered. Comparisons show
   that energy losses modify the bubble dynamics when the two approaches
   use identical initial conditions. The initial conditions in the boundary
   element method can be adjusted to recover the bubble period and maximum
   bubble volume when in an infinite medium. Using the same conditions
   enables the method to recover the full dynamics of single and tandem
   bubbles, including large deformations and fast re-entering jet
   formation. This method can be used as a design tool for future
   tandem-bubble sonoporation experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonic gold nanostars offer a new platform for surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS). However, due to the presence of organic surfactant on
   the nanoparticles, SERS characterization and application of nanostar
   ensembles in solution have been challenging. Here, we applied our newly
   developed surfactant-free nanostars for SERS characterization and
   application. The SERS enhancement factors (EF) of silver spheres, gold
   spheres and nanostars of similar sizes and concentration were compared.
   Under 785?nm excitation, nanostars and silver spheres have similar EF,
   and both are much stronger than gold spheres. Having plasmon matching
   the incident energy and multiple hot spots on the branches bring forth
   strong SERS response without the need to aggregate. Intracellular
   detection of silica-coated SERS-encoded nanostars was also demonstrated
   in breast cancer cells. The non-aggregated field enhancement makes the
   gold nanostar ensemble a promising agent for SERS bioapplications.

Abstract = {{This is a review of the evolution of thermodynamics during the past four
   decades, from classical (engineering) thermodynamics, to thermodynamic
   optimization, entropy generation minimization, exergy analysis, and most
   recently the constructal law of design and evolution in nature. The
   review shows that the first law and the second law refer to systems as
   ``black boxes{''}, without configuration. Yet, most of the literature in
   modern thermodynamics is about systems with configuration and about
   improving the performance of designs. The systems of nature are not
   black boxes: they have configurations that evolve ceaselessly. To
   complete the thermodynamics description of nature, the constructal law
   was added to the first law and the second law. The result is constructal
   thermodynamics, which unites the animate, inanimate, and engineered
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background Clinical studies increasingly report brain injury and not
   pulmonary injury following blast exposures, despite the increased
   frequency of exposure to explosive devices. The goal of this study was
   to determine the effect of personal body armour use on the potential for
   primary blast injury and to determine the risk of brain and pulmonary
   injury following a blast and its impact on the clinical care of patients
   with a history of blast exposure.
   Methods A shock tube was used to generate blast overpressures on soft
   ballistic protective vests (NIJ Level-2) and hard protective vests (NIJ
   Level-4) while overpressure was recorded behind the vest.
   Results Both types of vest were found to significantly decrease
   pulmonary injury risk following a blast for a wide range of conditions.
   At the highest tested blast overpressure, the soft vest decreased the
   behind armour overpressure by a factor of 14.2, and the hard vest
   decreased behind armour overpressure by a factor of 56.8. Addition of
   body armour increased the 50th percentile pulmonary death tolerance of
   both vests to higher levels than the 50th percentile for brain injury.
   Conclusions These results suggest that ballistic protective body armour
   vests, especially hard body armour plates, provide substantial chest
   protection in primary blasts and explain the increased frequency of head
   injuries, without the presence of pulmonary injuries, in protected
   subjects reporting a history of blast exposure. These results suggest
   increased clinical suspicion for mild to severe brain injury is
   warranted in persons wearing body armour exposed to a blast with or
   without pulmonary injury.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Here, we show how to distribute multiple layers of insulation along a
   nonisothermal enclosure so that the total heat loss is minimal. The
   types and total amounts of insulation materials are fixed. Variables are
   the thicknesses of the insulation layers, their relative amounts, the
   temperature of the insulated surface, and the cross-sectional area of
   the enclosure. We show that, first, the structure of the multi-layer
   insulation must be such that the thicknesses of all the layers vary in
   the same way in the longitudinal direction x. Second, the x dependence
   of the enclosure cross-sectional area has a significant effect on the
   heat loss reduction associated with using the distributed insulation
   design. Greater reductions in heat loss are obtained when the enclosure
   is tapered such that it is narrower in the direction of the warm end.
   Third, the x dependence of the temperature distribution along the
   insulated wall has a significant effect on the reduction in heat loss
   through reduction in heat loss through the multi-layer insulation.
   Greater reductions are obtained when the wall temperature distribution
   is more convex. Even greater reductions in heat loss are possible when
   the three design features summarized previously are implemented
   simultaneously. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   challenges that need to be addressed, such as flexible and robust
   geometric modeling schemes, efficient and stable time-stepping methods,

   very promising in simulating transient multiscale problems. This paper
   provides a comprehensive review of different DGTD schemes, highlighting
   the fundamental issues arising in each step of constructing a DGTD
   system. The issues discussed include the selection of governing

Abstract = {{Nanophotonic applications often involve large-scale problems with
   excessive demand on computational resources. We develop a domain
   decomposition method (DDM) to reduce computer memory and central
   processing unit (CPU) time requirements by combining the spectral
   element method (SEM) and the spectral integral method (SIM) for
   large-scale finite periodic structures. The interior scattering
   subdomains within each period are modeled by the SEM while the exterior
   scattering problem is modeled by the SIM. The interactions between
   neighboring subdomains are modeled by the frequency-domain version of
   the Riemann solver. Numerical convergence of the Riemann solver is fast
   and weakly dependent on the size of the system. Two sets of examples
   demonstrate the typical nanophotonic applications: The first periodic
   system is a vertical coupling waveguide based on a photonic crystal slab
   which opens a way to construct and simulate optical circuits. The second
   periodic system is a finite-sized metamaterial with an effective
   negative refractive index, whose edge effects are visualized and

Abstract = {{A method to optimally site river water quality sensors is expanded and
   applied to a case study river to explore the application of mathematical
   siting methods to the design of river sampling networks. Fecal coliform
   contamination due to flooded swine waste lagoons was modeled as it moves

   objective function of the optimization problem. The results of the
   simulations are analyzed by varying the number of allowed sampling
   locations and the simulated contamination event. For the case study
   application, the model suggests three sampling locations along the
   modeled river section. These three suggested sensing points did not
   greatly vary in location for different river flows and contamination
   events, indicating the robustness of the model results for this specific
   case study. Generally, the application of mathematical contaminant
   modeling is a useful and systematic approach to aid the design of river

Abstract = {{Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is a PHY capability that
   allows a receiver to decode packets that arrive simultaneously. While
   the technique is well known in communications literature, emerging
   software radio platforms are making practical experimentation feasible.
   This motivates us to study the extent of throughput gains possible with
   SIC from a MAC layer perspective and scenarios where such gains are
   worth pursuing. We find that contrary to our initial expectation, the
   gains are not high when the bits of interfering signals are not known a
   priori to the receiver. Moreover, we observe that the scope for SIC gets
   squeezed by the advances in bitrate adaptation. In particular, our
   analysis shows that interfering one-to-one transmissions benefit less
   from SIC than scenarios with many-to-one transmissions (such as when
   clients upload data to a common access point). In view of this, we
   develop an SIC-aware scheduling algorithm that employs client pairing
   and power reduction to extract the most gains from SIC. We believe that
   our findings will be useful guidelines for moving forward with SIC-aware
   protocol research.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of perimeter detection and monitoring has a variety of

   proposed for multiple autonomous robotic agents with the purpose of
   hazardous spill perimeter detection and tracking. In the system, each
   robotic agent is assumed to be in one of three states: searching,
   pursuing, and tracking. The agents are prioritized based on their
   states, and a potential field is constructed for agents in each state.
   For an agent in the tracking state, the agent's location and velocity as
   well as those of its closest leading and trailing agents are utilized to
   control its movement. The convergence of the tracking algorithm is
   analyzed for multiple spills under certain conditions. Simulation and
   experiment results show that with the proposed method, the agents can
   successfully detect and track the spills of various shapes, sizes, and

Abstract = {{Successful interaction with the world depends on accurate perception of
   the timing of external events. Neurons at early stages of the primate
   visual system represent time-varying stimuli with high precision.
   However, it is unknown whether this temporal fidelity is maintained in
   the prefrontal cortex, where changes in neuronal activity generally
   correlate with changes in perception. One reason to suspect that it is
   not maintained is that humans experience surprisingly large fluctuations
   in the perception of time. To investigate the neuronal correlates of
   time perception, we recorded from neurons in the prefrontal cortex and
   midbrain of monkeys performing a temporal-discrimination task. Visual
   time intervals were presented at a timescale relevant to natural
   behavior (<500 ms). At this brief timescale, neuronal
   adaptation-time-dependent changes in the size of successive
   responses-occurs. We found that visual activity fluctuated with timing
   judgments in the prefrontal cortex but not in comparable midbrain areas.
   Surprisingly, only response strength, not timing, predicted task
   performance. Intervals perceived as longer were associated with larger
   visual responses and shorter intervals with smaller responses, matching
   the dynamics of adaptation. These results suggest that the magnitude of

Abstract = {{Hydrogels have applications in drug delivery, mechanical actuation, and
   regenerative medicine. When hydrogels are deformed, load-relaxation
   arising from fluid flow-poroelasticity-and from rearrangement of the
   polymer network-viscoelasticity-is observed. The physical mechanisms are
   different in that poroelastic relaxation varies with experimental
   length-scale while viscoelastic does not. Here, we show that
   poroviscoelastic load-relaxation is the product of the two individual
   responses. The difference in length-scale dependence of the two
   mechanisms can be exploited to uniquely determine poroviscoelastic
   properties from simultaneous analysis of multi-scale indentation
   experiments, providing insight into hydrogel physical behavior. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Pedestrian movement occurs in evolutionary patterns the effect of which
   is to facilitate the access of people into and out of living spaces
   (areas, volumes). In this paper, we rely on the philosophy of
   Constructal design as applied physics, in order to uncover two
   fundamental features of evolutionary design for pedestrian evacuation
   from rectangular areas (e. g., lecture halls with seated occupants).
   First, the paper shows analytically that the aspect ratio of the floor
   area can be selected such that the total evacuation time is minimal.
   Second, the shape of the floor area of each aisle can be tapered such
   that the total evacuation time is decreased further. These two
   architectural features are confirmed by means of extensive and
   systematic numerical simulations of pedestrian evacuation, by using two
   numerical packages (Simulex and FDS + Evac). (C) 2013 American Institute

Abstract = {{Transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation have
   emerged as therapeutic modalities for treatment refractory depression;
   however, little remains known regarding the circuitry that mediates the
   therapeutic effect of these approaches. Here we show that direct
   optogenetic stimulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) descending projection
   neurons in mice engineered to express Chr2 in layer V pyramidal neurons
   (Thy1-Chr2 mice) models an antidepressant-like effect in mice subjected
   to a forced-swim test. Furthermore, we show that this PFC stimulation
   induces a long-lasting suppression of anxiety-like behavior (but not
   conditioned social avoidance) in socially stressed Thy1-Chr2 mice: an
   effect that is observed >10 d after the last stimulation. Finally, we
   use optogenetic stimulation and multicircuit recording techniques
   concurrently in Thy1-Chr2 mice to demonstrate that activation of
   cortical projection neurons entrains neural oscillatory activity and
   drives synchrony across limbic brain areas that regulate affect.
   Importantly, these neural oscillatory changes directly correlate with
   the temporally precise activation and suppression of limbic unit
   activity. Together, our findings show that the direct activation of
   cortical projection systems is sufficient to modulate activity across
   networks underlying affective regulation. They also suggest that
   optogenetic stimulation of cortical projection systems may serve as a
   viable therapeutic strategy for treating affective disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Although two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-GE) remains the basis for
   many ecotoxicoproteomic analyses, newer non-gel-based methods are
   beginning to be applied to overcome throughput and coverage limitations
   of 2D-GE. The overall objective of our research was to apply a
   comprehensive, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomic approach to identify and quantify
   differentially expressed hepatic proteins from female fathead minnows
   exposed to fadrozole, a potent inhibitor of estrogen synthesis. Female
   fathead minnows were exposed to 0 (control), 0.04, and 1.0 mu g of
   fadrozole/L of water for 4 days, and proteomic analysis was performed.
   Proteins were extracted and digested, and proteolytic peptides were
   separated via high-resolution one- or two-dimensional (I-D or 2-D)
   ultrapressure liquid chromatography (UPLC) and analyzed by tandem mass
   spectrometry. Mass spectra were searched against the National Center for
   Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii)
   database, resulting in identification of 782 unique proteins by
   single-dimension UPLC. When multidimensional LC analysis (2-D) was
   performed, an average increase of 1.9x in the number of identified
   proteins was observed. Differentially expressed proteins in fadrozole
   exposures were consistent with changes in liver function, including a
   decline in concentrations of vitellogenin as well as other proteins
   associated with endocrine function and cholesterol synthesis. Overall,
   these results demonstrate that a gel-free, label-free proteomic analysis
   method can successfully be utilized to determine differentially
   expressed proteins in small fish species after toxicant exposure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of the three-dimensional flow
   architecture of conjugate cooling channels in forced convection with
   internal heat generation within the solid for an array of circular
   cooling channels with different flow orientation. Three flow
   orientations were studied: array of channels with parallel flow; array
   of channels in which the flow in every second row is in a counter
   direction with its neighbours, and flows in all the arrays of channels
   are in counter flow relative to each other. The geometric configurations
   were determined in such a way that the peak temperature was minimised
   subject to the constraint of fixed global volume of solid material. The
   degrees of freedom of the design were hydraulic diameter and channel to
   channel spacing. A gradient-based optimisation algorithm was applied to
   search for the best optimal geometric configurations that improve
   thermal performance by minimising thermal resistance for a wide range of
   dimensionless pressure differences. The effect of porosities, applied
   pressure difference, flow orientation and heat generation rate on the
   optimal hydraulic diameter and channel to channel spacing is reported.
   The results show that the effects of dimensionless pressure drop on
   minimum thermal resistance were consistent with those obtained in the
   open literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach to the simulation of gravity-driven viscous
   fingering instabilities in porous media flow. These instabilities play a
   very important role during carbon sequestration processes in brine
   aquifers. Our approach is based on a nonlinear implementation of the
   discontinuous Galerkin method, and possesses a number of key features.
   First, the method developed is inherently high order, and is therefore
   well suited to study unstable flow mechanisms. Secondly, it maintains
   high-order accuracy on completely unstructured meshes. The combination
   of these two features makes it a very appealing strategy in simulating
   the challenging flow patterns and very complex geometries of actual
   reservoirs and aquifers. This article includes an extensive set of
   verification studies on the stability and accuracy of the method, and
   also features a number of computations with unstructured grids and
   non-standard geometries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to characterizing
   expression of laccases and peroxidases and their regulation in numerous
   fungal species. Much attention has been brought to these enzymes broad
   substrate specificity resulting in oxidation of a variety of organic
   compounds which brings about possibilities of their utilization in
   biotechnological and environmental applications. Research attempts have
   resulted in increased production of both laccases and peroxidases by the
   aid of heterologous and homologous expression. Through analysis of
   promoter regions, protein expression patterns and culture conditions
   manipulations it was possible to compare and identify common pathways of
   these enzymes' production and secretion. Although laccase and peroxidase
   proteins have been crystallized and thoroughly analyzed, there are still
   a lot of questions remaining about their evolutionary origin and the
   physiological functions. This review describes the present understanding
   of promoter sequences and correlation between the observed regulatory
   effects on laccase, manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase genes
   transcript levels and the presence of specific response elements. (C)

Title = {{A Host Transcriptional Signature for Presymptomatic Detection of
   Infection in Humans Exposed to Influenza H1N1 or H3N2}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{There is great potential for host-based gene expression analysis to
   impact the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. In particular, the
   influenza pandemic of 2009 highlighted the challenges and limitations of
   traditional pathogen-based testing for suspected upper respiratory viral
   infection. We inoculated human volunteers with either influenza A
   (A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) or A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)), and assayed
   the peripheral blood transcriptome every 8 hours for 7 days. Of 41
   inoculated volunteers, 18 (44\%) developed symptomatic infection. Using
   unbiased sparse latent factor regression analysis, we generated a gene
   signature (or factor) for symptomatic influenza capable of detecting
   94\% of infected cases. This gene signature is detectable as early as 29
   hours post-exposure and achieves maximal accuracy on average 43 hours (p
   = 0.003, H1N1) and 38 hours (p-value = 0.005, H3N2) before peak clinical
   symptoms. In order to test the relevance of these findings in naturally
   acquired disease, a composite influenza A signature built from these
   challenge studies was applied to Emergency Department patients where it
   discriminates between swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 (2009) infected and
   non-infected individuals with 92\% accuracy. The host genomic response
   to Influenza infection is robust and may provide the means for detection
   before typical clinical symptoms are apparent.}},

Abstract = {{Plague rupture is the most common cause of complications such as stroke
   and coronary heart failure. Recent histopathological evidence suggests
   that several plaque features, including a large lipid core and a thin
   fibrous cap, are associated with plaques most at risk for rupture.
   Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging, a recently developed
   ultrasound-based elasticity imaging technique, shows promise for imaging
   these features noninvasively. Clinically, this could be used to
   distinguish vulnerable plaques, for which surgical intervention may be
   required, from those less prone to rupture. In this study, a parametric
   analysis using Finite Element Method (FEM) models was performed to
   simulate ARFI imaging of five different carotid artery plaques across a
   wide range of material properties. It was demonstrated that ARFI imaging
   could resolve the softer lipid pool from the surrounding, stiffer media
   and fibrous cap and was most dependent upon the stiffness of the lipid
   pool component. Stress concentrations due to an ARFI excitation were
   located in the media and fibrous cap components. In all cases, the
   maximum Von Mises stress was < 1.2 kPa. In comparing these results with
   others investigating plaque rupture, it is concluded that while the
   mechanisms may be different, the Von Mises stresses imposed by ARFI
   imaging are orders of magnitude lower than the stresses associated with
   blood pressure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Shape and Migration}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{The issue of how contractility and adhesion are related to cell shape
   and migration pattern remains largely unresolved. In this paper we
   report that Gleevec (Imatinib), an Abl family kinase inhibitor, produces
   a profound change in the shape and migration of rat bladder tumor cells
   (NBTII) plated on collagen-coated substrates. Cells treated with Gleevec
   adopt a highly spread D-shape and migrate more rapidly with greater
   persistence. Accompanying this more spread state is an increase in
   integrin-mediated adhesion coupled with increases in the size and number
   of discrete adhesions. In addition, both total internal reflection
   fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and interference reflection microscopy
   (IRM) revealed a band of small punctate adhesions with rapid turnover
   near the cell leading margin. These changes led to an increase in global
   cell-substrate adhesion strength, as assessed by laminar flow
   experiments. Gleevec-treated cells have greater RhoA activity which, via
   myosin activation, led to an increase in the magnitude of total traction
   force applied to the substrate. These chemical and physical alterations
   upon Gleevec treatment produce the dramatic change in morphology and
   migration that is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Bispecific antibodies (bscAbs), particularly those of the bispecific
   T-cell engager (BiTE) subclass, have been shown to effectively redirect
   T cells against cancer. Previous efforts to target antigens expressed in
   both tumors and normal tissues have produced significant toxicity,
   however. Moreover, like other large molecules, bscAbs may be restricted
   from entry into the ``immunologically privileged{''} CNS. A
   tumor-specific mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor,
   EGFRvIII, is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase not found in
   normal tissues but frequently expressed in glioblastomas and many other
   neoplasms. Because it is localized solely to tumor tissue, EGFRvIII
   presents an ideal target for immunotherapy. Here we report the
   preclinical evaluation of an EGFRvIII-targeted BiTE, bscEGFRvIIIxCD3.
   Our results show that bscEGFRvIIIxCD3 activates T cells to mediate
   potent and antigen-specific lysis of EGFRvIII-expressing gliomas in
   vitro (P < 0.001) at exceedingly low concentrations (10 ng/mL) and
   effector-to-target ratios (2.5:1). Treatment with i.v. bscEGFRvIIIxCD3
   yielded extended survival in mice with well-established intracerebral
   tumors (P < 0.05) and achieved durable complete cure at rates up to
   75\%. Antitumor efficacy was significantly abrogated on blockade of
   EGFRvIII binding, demonstrating the need for target antigen specificity
   both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that BiTEs can be
   used to elicit functional antitumor immunity in the CNS, and that
   peptide blockade of BiTE-mediated activity may greatly enhance the
   safety profile for antibody-redirected T-cell therapies. Finally,
   bscEGFRvIIIxCD3 represents a unique advancement in BiTE technology given
   its exquisite tumor specificity, which enables precise elimination of
   cancer without the risk of autoimmune toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{We have proposed that the current amplitude in electroconvulsive therapy
   (ECT) be lowered to produce stimulation closer to the neural activation
   threshold and individualized to account for anatomical variability
   across patients. A novel approach to individualize the ECT current
   amplitude could be via motor threshold (MT) determination with
   transcranial electric stimulation (TES) applied through the ECT
   electrodes instead of the fixed high current approach. This study
   derives an estimate of the electric field (E-field) neural activation
   threshold and tests whether individual differences in TES MT are
   explained by anatomical variability measurements and simulations in
   individual head models. The E-field distribution induced by a right
   unilateral (RUL) ECT electrode configuration was computed in
   subject-specific finite element head models of four nonhuman primates
   (NHPs) for whom MT was measured. By combining the measured MTs and the
   computed E-field maps, the neural activation threshold is estimated to
   be 0.45 +/- 0.07 V/cm for 0.2 ms stimulus pulse width. The individual MT
   was correlated with the electrode-to-cortex distance under the superior
   electrode (R-2 =.96, p=.022) as well as with the simulated
   electrode-current/induced-E-field ratio (R-2 =.95, p=.026), indicating
   that both anatomical measurements and computational models could predict
   the individual current requirements for transcranial stimulation. These
   findings could be used with realistic human head models and in clinical
   studies to explore novel ECT dosing paradigms, and as a new noninvasive
   means to determine individual dosage requirement with ECT.}},

   estimation framework for Simultaneous Target and Multipath Positioning
   (STAMP) where target state is defined as a parent process and the
   reflector state is defined as the daughter process. A multi-hypothesis
   data association method is used with Probability Hypothesis Density
   (PHD) filtering to improve the accuracy of the target state estimate.
   The Gaussian target state is updated based on classic multiple-scan
   maximum likelihood data association while the update of multipath
   parameters is based conventional Gaussian Mixture PHD filtering.
   Experimental results using real data for an indoor target positioning
   problem demonstrates substantial improvements in localization accuracy

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) stacking of ICs using through-silicon-vias (TSVs)
   is a promising integration platform for next-generation ICs. Since TSVs
   are not fully accessible prior to bonding, it is difficult to test the
   combinational logic between scan flip-flops and TSVs at a pre-bond
   stage. In order to increase testability, it has been advocated that
   wrapper cells be added at both ends of a TSV. However, a drawback of
   wrapper cells is that they incur area overhead and lead to higher
   latency and performance degradation on functional paths. Prior work
   proposed the reuse of scan cells to achieve high testability, thereby
   reducing the number of wrapper cells that need to be inserted; however,
   practical timing considerations were overlooked and the number of
   inserted wrapper cells was still high. We show that the general problem
   of minimizing the wrapper cells is equivalent to the graph-theoretic
   minimum clique-partitioning problem, and is therefore NP-hard. We adopt
   efficient heuristic methods to solve the problem and describe a
   timing-guided and layout-aware solution. We also evaluate the heuristic
   methods using an exact solution technique based on integer linear
   programming. Results are presented for 3D-stack implementations of the
   ITC'99 and the OpenCore benchmark circuits.}},

Abstract = {{3D integration using through-silicon vias offers many benefits, such as
   high bandwidth, low power, and small footprint. However, test complexity
   and test cost are major concerns for 3D-SICs. Recent work on the
   optimization of 3D test architectures to reduce test cost suffer from
   the drawback that they ignore potential uncertainties in input
   parameters; they consider only a single point in the input-parameter
   space. In realistic scenarios, the assumed values for parameters such as
   test power and pattern count of logic cores, which are used for
   optimizing the test architecture for a die, may differ from the actual
   values that are known only after the design stage. In a 3D setting, a
   die can be used in multiple stacks each with different properties. As a
   result, the originally designed test architecture might no longer be
   optimal, which leads to an undesirable increase in the test cost. We
   propose an optimization approach that takes uncertainties in input
   parameters into account and provides a solution that is efficient in the
   presence of input-parameter variations. We use integer linear
   programming (ILP) to formulate the robust test-architecture optimization
   problem, and the resulting ILP model serves as the basis for a heuristic
   solution that scales well for large designs. The proposed optimization
   framework is evaluated using the ITC'02 SoC benchmarks and we show that
   robust solutions are superior to single-point solutions in terms of
   average test time when there are uncertainties in the values of input
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Transistor aging degrades path delay over time and may eventually induce
   circuit failure due to timing variations. Therefore, in-field tracking
   of path delays is essential and to respond to this need, several delay
   sensor designs have been proposed in the literature. However, due to the
   significant overhead of these designs and the large number of critical
   paths in today's IC, it is infeasible to monitor the delay of every
   critical path in silicon. We present an aging-aware representative
   path-selection method that allows us to measure the delay of a small set
   of paths and infer the delay of a larger pool of paths that are likely
   to fail due to transistor aging. Moreover, since aging is affected by
   process variations and runtime variations in temperature and voltage, we
   use machine learning and linear algebra to incorporate these variations
   during representative path selection. Simulation results for benchmark
   circuits highlight the accuracy of the proposed approach for predicting
   critical path delay based on the selected representative paths.}},

Abstract = {{We present a unique multi-antenna RFID reader (a sensor) embedded in a
   robot's manipulator that is designed to operate with ordinary UHF RFID
   tags in a short-range, near-field electromagnetic regime. Using
   specially designed near-field antennas enables our sensor to obtain
   spatial information from tags at ranges of less than 1 meter. In this
   work, we characterize the near-field sensor's ability to detect tagged
   objects in the robots manipulator, present robot behaviors to determine
   the identity of a grasped object, and investigate how additional RF
   signal properties can be used for ``pre-touch{''} capabilities such as
   servoing to grasp an object.
   The future combination of long-range (far-field) and short-range
   (near-field) UHF RFID sensing has the potential to enable roboticists to
   jump-start applications by obviating or supplementing
   false-positive-prone visual object recognition. These techniques may be

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of precisely localizing a group
   of stationary targets using a single stereo camera mounted on a mobile
   robot. In particular, assuming that at least one pair of stereo images
   of the targets is available, we seek to determine where to move the
   stereo camera so that the localization uncertainty of the targets is
   minimized. We call this problem the Next-Best-View problem. The
   advantage of using a stereo camera is that, using triangulation, the two
   simultaneous images can yield range and bearing measurements of the
   targets, as well as their uncertainty. We use a Kalman filter to fuse
   location and uncertainty estimates as more measurements are acquired.
   Our solution to the Next-Best-View problem is to iteratively minimize
   the fused uncertainty of the targets' locations subject to field-of-view
   constraints. We capture these objectives by appropriate artificial
   potentials on the camera's relative frame and the global frame,
   respectively. In particular, with every new observation, the mobile
   stereo camera computes the new next best view on the relative frame and
   subsequently realizes this view in the global frame via gradient descent
   on the space of robot positions and orientations, until a new
   observation is made. Integration of next best view with motion planning
   results in a hybrid system, which we illustrate in computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A small band-notched monopole ultrawideband (UWB) antenna is proposed in
   this letter. In this antenna, the band-reject is achieved by attaching a
   strip to the hollow center of a wing-shaped monopole. The height and
   width of the strip are dependent on the center frequency of the notch
   band. The proposed antenna is printed on a very small (11 x 15 mm(2))
   substrate. The measured results reveal that the proposed antenna offers
   a wide bandwidth covering 5-15 GHz with a notched band covering a
   6.7-7.1-GHz IEEE INSAT/super-extended C-band frequency. The proposed
   antenna shows very narrow and accurate band rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing demands on datacenter computing prompts research in
   energy-efficient warehouse scale systems. In one approach, server
   activation policies invoke low-power sleep states but the power state
   transition latency must be small to produce effective energy savings.
   Chrome OS and Arch Linux require 50ms and 650ms, respectively, to enter
   sleep states. These states consume merely 4-6\% of nominal power. By
   analyzing the critical path, we propose strategies for selecting
   hardware components and optimizing kernel resume sequences to make
   datacenter server activation viable. With fast transitions, server
   activation can provide better performance at lower energy than dynamic
   voltage and frequency scaling.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical remodeling begins early and the cervix progressively softens
   throughout pregnancy. Premature changes may be associated with preterm
   birth, but there is currently no clinical objective method for assessing
   the softness of the cervix. Shear wave speed estimation is a noninvasive
   technique to evaluate tissue mechanical properties. The goal of this
   study is to determine the discriminatory ability of shear wave speed
   estimation to detect differences between ripened/softened and unripened
   cervix samples. Hysterectomy samples (n = 22), a subset of which were
   ripened (n = 13), were collected from non-pregnant women. The samples
   were scanned with a 9L4 linear array transducer after excision parallel
   to the endocervical canal at the mid position along the length of the
   canal on both anterior and posterior halves. T-tests and receiver
   operating characteristics (ROC) were used to analyze the performance of
   SWS estimates. The SWS estimates for the unripened group at the mid
   position were 3.45 +/- 0.95 m/s (anterior) and 3.56 +/- 0.92 m/s
   (posterior), and 2.11 +/- 0.45 m/s (anterior) and 2.68 +/- 0.57m/s
   (posterior) for the ripened (p<0.001). The corresponding area under the
   curve (AUC) were 0.91 for anterior and 0.84 for posterior. Our results
   suggest that shear wave speed estimation may be a potential research and
   diagnostic tool for quantification of cervical stiffness/softness.}},

   Hysterectomy samples were collected (n = 22), a subset of which were
   ripened (n = 13). Multiple SWS measurements were made longitudinally
   along the cervical canal at 4-5 locations on both anterior and posterior
   halves of the cervix. Statistical tests were performed to determine
   significance of SWS as a function of position along the canal, anterior
   vs. posterior, ripened vs. unripened and variability among cervical
   samples using a linear mixed model. We found that SWS estimates
   monotonically increased from distal to proximal longitudinally along the

Abstract = {{Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is commonly used to treat cardiac
   arrhythmias, by generating a contiguous series of discrete
   radiofrequency ablation (RFA) lesions in the myocardium to destroy or

   controlled by the duration and power of the delivered RF energy, and by
   the temperature of the tissue at the surface, but feedback on the extent
   and transmurality of the generated lesion are unavailable with current
   technology. Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) may provide a solution
   through Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging or Shear Wave

Abstract = {{Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) based elasticity imaging methods
   have been under development for the past 15 years, and both qualitative
   on-axis (ARFI imaging) and quantitative shear wave speed (SWEI) methods
   have been introduced into the commercial market. On-axis methods employ
   less processing and provide higher spatial resolution, whereas SWEI
   methods employ reconstruction algorithms that afford higher contrast and
   provide quantitative estimates of the underlying material stiffness.
   Each approach can be optimized through custom beam sequences and
   processing algorithms for specific clinical applications. We discuss
   three specific applications herein: 1) hepatic fibrosis and steatosis
   staging through SWEI, 2) 3D SWEI for characterizing material anisotropy,
   and 3) 3D prostatic SWEI and ARFI imaging.
   1) SWEI in hepatic disease: The potential for employing SWEI methods to
   stage liver disease has been demonstrated clinically through the
   correlation of group shear wave velocity with hepatic fibrosis stage
   when applying elastic material assumptions. Through Fourier analysis of
   the broadband propagating shear wave generated by ARFI excitation,
   dispersion of wave propagation can be characterized, allowing the use of
   higher order, viscoelastic material models. In a cohort of 119
   Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) patients, a comparison of
   hepatic disease characterization using a one-parameter elastic material
   model to derive shear wave speed (SWS) with the two-parameter Voigt
   model to derive elasticity (1) and viscosity (2) is performed. AUROC
   analysis demonstrates that no improvement in fibrosis stage
   characterization is achieved through the use of the Voigt model.
   However, threshold SWS values for the differentiation of advanced liver
   disease (>= F3) from mild to moderate disease (<= F2) are shown to
   increase from 1.7 to 2.5 m/s with increasing frequency over the range
   from 0400 Hz. In addition, no correlation is observed between any of the
   shear wave parameters and steatosis.
   2) 3D SWEI: We have developed an integrated volumetric shear wave
   imaging system using a HIFU piston for ARFI excitation, and a 2D matrix
   array (4Z1C) and a Siemens SC2000 scanner to perform volumetric imaging.
   In isotropic materials, this system allows improved shear wave estimate
   precision over that obtained with planar imaging. In anisotropic
   materials such as skeletal muscle, this system enables accurate
   determination of muscle fiber orientation and the principal axes of
   propagation. Through Fourier analysis of 3D propagation, we observe
   decreasing shear wave speed anisotropy with increasing shear wave
   frequency.
   3) 3D prostate imaging: Using a linear, transrectal ultrasound array, an
   external automated rotation stage, and 16: 1 parallel processing on an
   SC2000 scanner, on-axis (ARFI) and off-axis (SWEI) data is obtained
   concurrently for each excitation throughout the entire prostate volume
   in vivo. Good agreement is observed between the ARFI and SWEI data, with
   the ARFI images providing better resolution. Prostate structures and
   some regions of pathology are well visualized in pre-operatively
   acquired ARFI images, as determined by correlation with pre-operative MR
   images and whole-mount histology data obtained post
   radical-prostatectomy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the spatial coherence properties of the signal
   backscattered by human tissue and measured by an ultrasound transducer.
   Fourier acoustics are used to describe the propagation of ultrasound
   through a model of tissue that includes multiple reverberations and
   random scatterers in the imaging plane. The theoretical development
   describes the evolution of the spatial coherence as it propagates
   through the near-field tissue layers, is reflected at the focus, and is
   received at the transducer surface. Simulations are used to propagate
   the acoustic field through a histologically measured representation of
   the human abdomen and to validate the theoretical predictions. In vivo
   measurements performed with a diagnostic ultrasound scanner demonstrate
   show that simulations and theory closely match the measured spatial
   coherence characteristics in the human body. The theoretical framework
   and simulations are then used to describe the physics of spatial
   coherence imaging, a type of ultrasound imaging that measures tissue's
   scattering properties with high resolution and contrast.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality used for diagnostic
   assessment of fetal and maternal health during pregnancy. However, a
   large proportion of fetal ultrasound exams suffer from inadequate or
   lack of visualization of clinically relevant structures due to
   acoustical noise or clutter. These undesirable effects are even more
   pronounced in overweight and obese mothers. In previous work our group
   has introduced short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) and harmonic spatial
   coherence imaging (HSCI) as methods for clutter reduction. These have
   been shown to be successful in improving image contrast and border
   delineation in both simulations and in vivo experiments on liver and
   cardiac imaging. We extend the application of these techniques to fetal
   ultrasound imaging. We collected individual channel RF data on 11
   volunteers in their first trimester of pregnancy. The amount of
   intrinsic clutter varied across the volunteers. These data sets were
   used to generate matched fundamental B-mode, SLSC, harmonic B-mode, and
   HSCI images. These images were compared qualitatively by assessing image
   texture and target detectability and quantitatively using SNR, CNR, and
   contrast. SLSC and HSCI images showed significant improvements across
   all imaging metrics compared to B-mode and harmonic B-mode,
   respectively. The improvements in clutter suppression and improved
   conspicuity of target structures were greatest for poor quality B-mode
   images. Clutter levels in these images, measured in a region of amniotic
   fluid compared to a region of uniform speckle, were measured to be 15 dB
   for B-mode versus 27 dB for SLSC, and 17 dB for harmonic B-mode versus
   30 dB for HSCI. CNR for the same set of images improved from 1.4 to 2.5
   for B-mode to SLSC and from 1.4 to 3.1 for harmonic B-mode to HSCI.}},

Abstract = {{Power Doppler imaging is a commonly used method for the detection of
   flow. The direction of flow is lost with power Doppler, but it has
   greater sensitivity to flow compared to velocity estimation techniques.
   Power Doppler imaging can be degraded if thermal noise is large or if
   slowly moving reverberation clutter passes through the wall filter. We
   have developed a power Doppler imaging technique, based on the same
   principles as power Doppler, but uses the coherence of backscattered
   blood signal rather than the complex backscattered signal. This
   technique, called SLSC power Doppler, is less sensitive to clutter-based
   signals and thermal noise. We show in simulations, phantom, and in vivo
   experiments that the detected flow demonstrates a smoother, fuller
   profile and is more robust to the presence of thermal noise. The
   technique can also utilize fewer ensemble samples to obtain satisfactory
   detection of flow.}},

Abstract = {{Our long-term goal is the detection and characterization of vulnerable
   plaque in the coronary arteries of the heart using IVUS catheters.
   Vulnerable plaque, characterized by a thin fibrous cap and a soft,
   lipid-rich, necrotic core is a pre-cursor to heart attack and stroke.
   Early detection of such plaques may potentially alter the course of
   treatment of the patient in order to prevent ischemic events. In this
   paper, we modified Volcano Visions 8.2 French, 9MHz catheters and
   Volcano Platinum 3.5 French, 20MHz catheters by short circuiting
   portions of the array for ARFI applications. The catheters had an
   effective transmit aperture size of 2mm and 1.5mm respectively. The
   catheters were connected to a Verasonics scanner and driven with pushing
   pulses of 180V(p-p) to acquire ARFI data from a soft gel phantom with a
   Young's modulus of 2.9 kPa. The dynamic response of the tissue-mimicking
   material demonstrates a typical ARFI motion of 1-2 microns as the gel
   phantom displaces away and recovers back to its normal position. Our
   results demonstrate that the generation of radiation force from IVUS
   catheters and the development of intravascular ARFI may be feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) imaging has been used to reduce
   clutter in ultrasound imaging by using echo coherence instead of signal
   magnitude as a contrast mechanism. Apodization strategies used to reduce
   off-axis scattering in conventional B-mode imaging are shown to extend
   coherence length and reduce SLSC contrast, resulting in decreased in
   image quality. It is possible to invert these schemes to increase
   scattering, improving contrast but not preventing recorrelation in
   hypoechoic regions. Adding channel noise to the signals can reduce the
   correlation and reduce clutter. Similarly, we propose adding
   uncorrelated properties to the aperture by randomizing magnitude or
   phase, taking advantage of their uncorrelated properties to modify the
   coherence curve. These effects can be exploited to relax system
   requirements and simplify SLSC imaging while improving image quality.}},

Abstract = {{SLSC imaging is an advanced ultrasound beamforming technique that
   generates images of the coherence in the backscattered echo and has been
   shown to suppress image degradation due to clutter. However, the
   computational demand and the need for access to channel data has made
   real-time implementation difficult. GPU computing can significantly
   improve computational throughput, but has been used primarily to
   accelerate offline image processing. By implementing the SLSC algorithm
   on 3 GPUs and integrating it with a Verasonics ultrasound scanner, we
   have realized a real-time simultaneous B-mode and SLSC imaging system.
   We demonstrate the real-time imaging capabilities on an in vivo liver,
   gallbladder, and carotid artery and present snapshots of the on-screen
   display. The SLSC images were found to suppress clutter and showed a
   more homogeneous texture in tissue when compared to the B-mode images.
   Computation time and imaging frame rate were highly dependent on the
   imaging parameters. When imaging the liver, 46 transmit beams with a
   range of 10 cm were obtained at 6.7 fps for standard imaging and at 2.1
   fps for harmonic imaging. A frame rate of 5.9 fps was achieved for
   carotid artery imaging with 129 transmit beams and a range of 3 cm. By
   restricting the field of view to 65 transmit beams and a range of 2 cm,
   a frame rate of 12.5 fps was achieved. Further increases in frame rates
   can be attained with additional system development and improvements to
   hardware.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the spatial coherence properties of the signal
   backscattered by human tissue and measured by an ultrasound transducer.
   Fourier acoustics are used to describe the propagation of ultrasound
   through a model of tissue that includes multiple reverberations and
   random scatterers in the imaging plane. The theoretical development
   describes the evolution of the spatial coherence as it propagates
   through the near-field tissue layers, is reflected at the focus, and is
   received at the transducer surface. Simulations are used to propagate
   the acoustic field through a histologically measured representation of
   the human abdomen and to validate the theoretical predictions. In vivo
   measurements performed with a diagnostic ultrasound scanner demonstrate
   show that simulations and theory closely match the measured spatial
   coherence characteristics in the human body. The theoretical framework
   and simulations are then used to describe the physics of spatial
   coherence imaging, a type of ultrasound imaging that measures tissue's
   scattering properties with high resolution and contrast.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging has shown improved
   visualization of arterial structures that may provide for a more
   reliable assessment of atherosclerotic risk than conventional B-mode
   imaging. Existing ARFI imaging methods, however, are limited due to the
   presence of clutter that can increase bias and jitter in estimates of
   tissue deformation. We have recently developed a novel pulse inversion
   harmonic tracking method to suppress clutter degradation in ultrasonic
   tissue displacement estimates. In this work, harmonic B-mode and
   harmonic ARFI images of in vivo carotid arteries are compared with
   fundamental images obtained using conventional techniques. A certified
   reader measured the intima-media-thickness (IMT) in B-mode images and
   the adventitia-intima-media-thickness (AIMT) in ARFI images. The yield
   and the length of the artery amenable for analysis were larger in ARFI
   images compared to B-mode images. Intra-reader measurements of ARFI AIMT
   in the distal wall were more reproducible than B-mode IMT measurements.
   Qualitatively, harmonic ARFI images showed improved delineation of the
   vessel-lumen interface compared to fundamental ARFI images. These
   results suggest that harmonic ARFI imaging may provide a reliable method
   for monitoring arterial thickening to predict the occurrence of clinical
   events.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter is as much about the process of reverse engineering as it
   is about a particular drug delivery system. It presents the materials
   science and materials engineering concepts that went into the design and
   testing of the LTSL including: the roles of each of the components that
   make up the composite membrane; how the molecular and nanostructures
   that they form might influence the already anomalous permeability at the
   phase transition of the bilayer; and how this thermally sensitive drug
   delivery system leads to ultrafast, heat-mediated, triggered,
   intravascular release of pre-loaded doxorubicin. Release of drug
   penetrating deep into the tumor interstitium, is controlled by where,
   when, and for how long mild hyperthermia (HT) is applied 1 in relation
   to the liposome administration. This formulation, as ThermoDox (R), has
   been used in a completed 700 patient Phase III human clinical trial in
   liver cancer (HEAT study), is in a Phase II trial in chest wall
   recurrence of cancer (DIGNITY study), and is also in a Phase I trial of
   patients with colorectal liver metastases (ABLATE study). 2 It is a
   bench-to-bedside story that addresses both overcoming limitations in
   nanoparticle drug delivery and also the importance of research
   implementation in translation to the clinic. With additional research
   and preclinical studies underway, including exploring the use of high
   frequency ultrasound (HiFu) as a heating modality, and a range of other
   drugs, imaging agents and biological modifiers poised for encapsulation,
   the LTSL could provide a new paradigm for drug and agent delivery for
   the treatment of localized tumors - `rapid triggered drug release in the
   tumor bloodstream and deep penetration of drug into the tumor tissue'.
   Unfortunately, the Phase III trial in liver cancer failed to meet its
   required endpoints for progression-free survival (PFS). While data is
   still being analyzed, preclinical and now clinical research shows that
   it is essential for all future trials of this particular formulation,
   that the whole tumor should be heated to the desired temperature (41-42
   degrees C), and maintained at that temperature while ThermoDox (R) is
   infused for a minimum of 20 min, and probably an hour, i.e., heat first
   and then infuse drug.}},

Abstract = {{There are two methods for code conversion: stabilizer sequence and code
   teleportation. The stabilizer sequence method is to apply a sequence of
   stabilizers between two codes with repetitive error-correction by
   stabilizers. On the other hand the code teleportation is to apply the
   teleportation of encoded qubits. Since we have two methods, it is our
   choice to choose any of them for target situation. To guide the choice,
   we analyze the necessary cost for each protocol. Specifically we compare
   two methods for the situation where 5-qubit and 7-qubit should be
   interchanged. In this work, we found that the code teleportation method
   needs less overhead than the stabilizer method.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of improving the accuracy and reliability of
   probabilistic white matter tractography methods by improving the
   built-in sampling scheme, which randomly draws, from a diffusion model
   such as the orientation distribution function (ODF), a direction of
   propagation. Existing methods employing inverse transform sampling
   require an ad hoc thresholding step to prevent the less likely
   directions from being sampled. We herein propose to perform importance
   sampling of spherical harmonics, which redistributes an input point set
   on the sphere to match the ODF using hierarchical sample warping. This
   produces a point set that is more concentrated around the modes,
   allowing the subsequent inverse transform sampling to generate
   orientations that are in better accordance with the local fiber
   configuration. Integrated into a Kalman filter-based framework, our
   approach is evaluated through experiments on synthetic, phantom, and
   real datasets.}},

Abstract = {{To reconstruct objects buried in layered media, most of current imaging
   methods are based on a common assumption that the dielectric properties
   of layered media are given. However, this assumption is unrealistic in
   practice. To study a more realistic electromagnetic inverse scattering
   problem in which the dielectric properties of layered media are not
   given, an inverse scattering series (ISS) method which has been used in
   seismic exploration is extended into electromagnetic field. By using the
   developed ISS method, objects buried in layered media can be imaged
   without knowing the dielectric properties of layered media a prior. The
   feasibility of the improved ISS method has been demonstrated by some
   numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A planar dual-mode ring resonator loaded by four mushroom-shaped stubs
   is presented for design of dual-band bandpass filter (BPF). The four
   mushroom-shaped stubs utilized in the inner area of the traditional

   harmonic response of the filter to generate the second passband.
   Additionally, a novel pair of feed lines with source-load coupling is
   employed to not only feed the ring resonator but also generate the
   higher third passband when the length of feed lines increases. For
   demonstration purpose, two example filters (dual-band BPF and tri-band

Abstract = {{Aiming to achieve wideband and unidirectional radiation, a planar
   printed antenna with two closely spaced strips is proposed and
   fabricated. This antenna consists of a printed rectangular loop and two
   metallic strips. The rectangular loop has a good direction but has a
   drawback of narrow band. According to the closely spaced loading theory,
   the impedance at the upper frequency will decrease when the two metallic
   strips is placed at the maximum radiation direction of the rectangular
   loop. This improves the impedance matching. Thus the impedance bandwidth
   is greatly expanded. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   double strips, a prototype of the antenna is fabricated and tested.
   Experimental results show good performance of the proposed antenna. It
   has a 62.7\% measured bandwidth, ranging from 2.29 to 4.38 GHz. The
   measured F/B (front-to-back) ratio is larger than 8 dB in the whole

Abstract = {{Today's technology allows for the integration of many cores in a single
   die, for instance, in core-based SoCs, and an even larger number of
   cores are likely to be integrated over multiple layers in a 3D stack. In
   order to minimize test cost, the test architecture in a core-based SOC
   is optimized for minimum test time. Optimization methods in use today
   assume that all relevant input parameters, such as core test time and
   power consumption during test, are known at the design stage. However,
   these parameters can change after manufacturing and, in that scenario,
   the originally designed test architecture may no longer be optimal.
   Moreover, conventional optimization methods have to consider worst-case
   estimates for all input parameters to ensure feasibility, which can
   result in conservative and hence expensive solutions. We propose the use
   of robust optimization for test-architecture design and test scheduling.
   This goal of this approach is to find a solution that remains close to
   optimal in the presence of parameter variations. Experimental results
   for the ITC'02 SoC benchmarks show that, compared to optimization
   methods that target only a single point in the input-parameter space,
   robust optimization can better optimize test time in the presence of
   parameter variations.}},

Abstract = {{High-volume manufacturing of complex electronic products involves
   functional test at board level to ensure low defect escapes.
   Machine-learning techniques have recently been proposed for
   reasoning-based functional-fault diagnosis system to achieve high
   diagnosis accuracy. However, machine learning requires a rich set of
   test items (syndromes) and a sizable database of faulty boards. An
   insufficient number of failed boards, ambiguous root-cause
   identification, and redundant or irrelevant syndromes can render machine
   learning ineffective. We propose an evaluation and enhancement framework
   based on information theory for guiding diagnosis systems using syndrome
   and root-cause analysis. Syndrome analysis based on subset selection
   provides a representative set of syndromes with minimum redundancy and
   maximum relevance. Root-cause analysis measures the discriminative
   ability of differentiating a given root cause from others. The metrics
   obtained from the proposed framework can also provide guidelines for
   test redesign to enhance diagnosis. A real board from industry,
   currently in volume production, and an additional synthetic board, based
   on data extrapolated from another real board, are used to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a circuit model of the memristor using SPICE is
   presented, which expands the hitherto methods to solve the memristor's
   modeling equations presented by HP lab. This kind of the memristor model
   can not only be encoded in SPICE and satisfy the properties of the
   general memristive systems, but also use few components and simulate
   fast. In order to further explore the nonlinear and switching
   characteristics of the memristor model, a directly modulated patch
   antenna with one memristor is designed by using finite-difference
   time-domain (FDTD) simulator integrated with the nonlinear SPICE circuit

Abstract = {{We consider the use of insulated single wires as transmission lines to
   carry 100 MHz - 3 GHz radio frequency (RF) signals among devices
   implanted in biological tissue. In contrast to near-field magnetically
   coupled links, the use of transmission lines to carry RF signals results
   in higher efficiency for a given implant package size once the antenna
   is included, albeit with the disadvantage of tissue displacement along
   the path of the wire.
   We present a theory based on the work of Goubau and Rao that describes
   the transmission line loss of a single insulated wire in a lossy
   dielectric medium. We experimentally verify the characteristic impedance
   and insertion loss of transmission lines formed by thin wires insulated
   with Teflon fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEY). We consider media
   including 0.91\% saline (a homogeneous tissue proxy), muscle tissue, and
   brain tissue, and present a launcher design based on a dielectric loaded
   coaxial sleeve. For example. in the saline proxy, a single FEP-insulated
   conductor of only 0.127 mm diameter presents a measured return loss of
   10 dB in a 50 Omega system, with a measured insertion loss of only 1
   dB/cm at I GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic blockmodels provide a rich, probabilistic framework for
   modeling relational data by expressing the objects being modeled in
   terms of a latent vector representation. This representation can be a
   latent indicator vector denoting the cluster membership (hard
   clustering), a vector of cluster membership probabilities (soft
   clustering), or more generally a real-valued vector (latent space
   representation). Recently, a new class of overlapping stochastic
   blockmodels has been proposed where the idea is to allow the objects to
   have hard memberships in multiple clusters (in form of a latent binary
   vector). This aspect captures the properties of many real-world networks
   in domains such as biology and social networks where objects can
   simultaneously have memberships in multiple clusters owing to the
   multiple roles they may have. In this paper, we improve upon this model
   in three key ways: (1) we extend the overlapping stochastic blockmodel
   to the bipartite graph case which enables us to simultaneously learn the
   overlapping clustering of two different sets of objects in the graph;
   the unipartite graph is just a special case of our model, (2) we allow
   objects (in either set) to not have membership in any cluster by using a
   relevant object selection mechanism, and (3) we make use of additionally
   available object features (or a kernel matrix of pairwise object
   similarities) to further improve the overlapping clustering performance.
   We do this by explicitly encouraging similar objects to have similar
   cluster membership vectors. Moreover, using nonparametric Bayesian prior
   distributions on the key model parameters, we side-step the model
   selection issues such as selecting the number of clusters a priori. Our
   model is quite general and can be applied for both overlapping
   clustering and link prediction tasks in unipartite and bipartite
   networks (directed/undirected), or for overlapping co-clustering of
   general binary-valued data. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
   datasets from biology and social networks demonstrate that our model
   outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{With appropriate geometry configurations, bistatic Synthetic Aperture
   Radar (SAR) can break through the limitations of monostatic SAR for
   forward-looking imaging. This paper develops an extended nonlinear Chirp
   Scaling imaging algorithm for translational variant BFSAR. The method
   utilizes a point target reference spectrum of generalized Loffeld's
   bistatic formula (GLBF). Without bistatic deformation term, GLBF is the
   latest development of Loffeld's bistatic formula. After an azimuth
   frequency transformation in 2-D frequency domain, the azimuth spatial
   variation is removed. Then through a fourth-order frequency domain
   filtering, the algorithm can consider the quadratic variance term of the
   range frequency modulated rate and the linear term of the tertiary
   coupling phase term along cross-track direction. In addition, by a
   fourth-order nonlinear Chirp Scaling equalization operation, the
   algorithm can finish the correction of quadratic range cell migration in
   terms of range. The result of this paper can be used for forward-looking
   reconnaissance, guidance and so on.}},

Abstract = {{Presented are results demonstrating that, in developing a system with
   its first objective being the sustained detection of adults and young
   children as they move and interact in a normal preschool setting, the
   direct application of the straightforward RGB-D innovations presented
   here significantly outperforms even far more algorithmically advanced
   methods relying solely on images. The use of multiple RGB-D sensors by
   this project for depth-aware object localization economically resolves
   numerous issues regularly frustrating earlier visiononly detection and
   human surveillance methods, issues such as occlusions, illumination
   changes, unexpected postures, atypical morphologies, erratic or
   unanticipated motions, reflections, and misleading textures and
   colorations.
   This multiple RGB-D installation forms the front-end for a multi-step
   pipeline, the first portion of which seeks to isolate, in situ, 3D
   renderings of classroom occupants sufficient for a later analysis of
   their behaviors and interactions. Towards this end, a voxel-based
   approach to foreground/background separation and an effective adaptation
   of supervoxel clustering for 3D were developed, and 3D and image-only
   methods were tested and compared. The project's setting is highly
   challenging, but then so are its longer term goals: the automated
   detection of early childhood precursors, ofttimes very subtle, to a
   number of increasingly common developmental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for movement
   disorders and a promising therapy for treating epilepsy and psychiatric
   disorders. Despite its success, the clinical efficacy of DBS can be
   improved; for example, by reducing the number of surgeries required to
   replace batteries or to correct misplaced leads, which increase the
   risks and cost of the therapy. Our objective was to design novel
   electrode designs that increase the efficiency and selectivity of DBS.
   We coupled computational models of cylindrical stimulation electrodes
   with cable models of axons of passage (AOP), terminating axons (TA), and
   local neurons (LN); and we used engineering optimization to design
   electrodes for stimulating these elements. Compared with the clinical
   Model 3387 electrode, optimal electrodes consumed 48-67\% less power.
   Similar gains in selectivity were evident with the optimized electrodes,
   which reduced the activation of non-targeted elements from 34-71 \% with
   the 3387 array to only 1-36 \%, while activating 100\% of the targeted
   elements. Overall, both the geometry and polarity of the electrode had a
   profound impact on the efficiency and selectivity of stimulation. Thus,
   model-based design is a powerful tool that can be used to increase the
   efficacy of DBS by increasing electrode performance.}},

   frequency bands were assessed using wavelet and current source density
   analysis. ECT showed greater increases in EEG power relative to baseline
   in all frequencies during the early and mid-ictal periods, and decrease
   in power during the post-ictal period. MST seizures showed little change
   in ictal EEG power and postictal suppression relative to baseline.
   Compared to MST, ECT showed greater changes in power in all frequencies.
   Contrasting the seizure topography induced by ECT and MST can provide
   insights into the impact of stimulation focality on the patterns of

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation of pudendal nerve (PN) afferents to cause reflex
   activation or inhibition of the bladder is a promising approach to
   restore control of bladder function in persons with dysfunction caused
   by disease or injury. The objective of this work was to evaluate the
   effects of novel temporal patterns of stimulation on the size of
   isovolumetric stimulation-evoked reflex bladder contractions and
   determine if the temporal pattern, of stimulation, like frequency,
   modulates the reflex bladder response to stimulation. The temporal
   pattern of stimulation significantly affected the size of bladder
   contractions evoked by stimulation in anesthetized cats. Patterns with
   pauses and random patterns evoked significantly smaller bladder
   contractions, while patterns with subtle changes in
   inter-pulse-intervals (IPIs), ramp trains and alternating IPI trains,
   occasionally evoked larger bladder contractions than constant frequency
   stimulation. The use of new temporal patterns of electrical stimulation
   should be considered in the development of neural prosthetics for the
   restoration of lower urinary tract function.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established treatment for chronic
   pain. However, SCS only provides 50\% or greater pain relief to
   approximately 60\% of patients, and the efficacy of SCS tends to decline
   over time. Efforts to optimize SCS have focused on the spatial aspects
   of SCS such as electrode design and electrode geometry while neglecting
   stimulation parameter selection and have assumed that the dorsal horn
   pain processing network is static. We developed a biophysical network
   model of the dorsal horn circuit capable of reproducing key
   electrophysiological data relevant to pain processing. Using this model,
   we simulated the effects of SCS applied at between 5 Hz and 150 Hz on
   the activity of projection neurons responsible for relaying pain signals
   to the brain. SCS at 30-100 Hz produced maximal inhibition of projection
   neuron activity. Furthermore, we quantified responses to SCS with
   diminished levels of inhibition in the dorsal horn to simulate the
   effect of disease progression. The degree to which projection neurons
   were inhibited by SCS declined as the strength of inhibitory mechanisms
   was reduced, and the optimal SCS frequency decreased to 15 Hz. Our
   simulation results suggest that the efficacy of SCS is dependent on
   stimulation frequency and that the loss of dorsal horn inhibition during
   chronic pain may explain the decline in SCS efficacy over time. These
   findings provide insights regarding the mechanisms of SCS and pave the
   way for improved SCS stimulation parameter selection.}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves the distal motor symptoms of
   Parkinson's disease, but long-term improvements in gait and postural
   disturbances are less pronounced. The effects of stimulation location,
   within the large nuclear region of the substantia nigra pars reticulata
   (SNr), and stimulation parameters on improvement in gait are unclear,
   and this lack of foundational knowledge hinders the application and
   optimization of SNr DBS.
   We quantified the effects of medial vs. lateral SNr DBS on
   methamphetamine-induced circling in hemiparkinsonian rats to test the
   hypothesis that stimulation location differentially modulates axial
   symptoms. The frequency tuning curves showed opposite trends with
   stimulation frequency; during high frequency stimulation, medial SNr DBS
   decreased ipsilateral circling, while lateral SNr DBS had no effect on
   circling. As well, we quantified the effects of 130 Hz SNr DBS on gait
   to test the hypothesis that SNr DBS location differentially modulates
   gait. High frequency DBS of the medial SNr, but not lateral SNr,
   improved the rat's ability to maintain walking speed. The therapeutic
   effects of medial SNr DBS appeared to improve with time on the same
   order as clinical studies (>10 min).
   These results suggest that improvement in gait depends on the location
   of the electrodes (medial vs. lateral SNr) with a time course for
   improvement reminiscent of human data and provide a rational basis for
   the appropriate selection of implant site and stimulation parameters for
   SNr DBS.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves is a widespread technique
   for the treatment of neurological diseases and disorders. However,
   peripheral stimulation typically requires surgical implantation of an
   electrode and a pulse generator. Transcutaneous stimulation with an
   external electrode and pulse generator could provide a noninvasive
   alternative for nerve stimulation. In this study we implemented a lumped
   parameter electrical circuit and a distributed parameter volume
   conductor model to quantify the distribution of potentials in the
   tissue, including frequency-dependent dielectric properties, during
   transcutaneous electrical stimulation with a very high frequency
   sinusoidal carrier and rectangular envelope pulse. The circuit model
   exhibited a high-pass behavior with a corner frequency around 100 kHz,
   whereas the volume conductor model revealed maximum penetration of the
   potential for high frequency signals. Taken together, these results
   suggest that incorporating high frequency components in
   voltage-controlled transcutaneous stimulation may make it possible to
   reach deeper structures in the tissue, such as nerves.}},

Abstract = {{With software systems becoming increasingly large and complex, many
   difficulties in coping with software bugs arise for developers. Despite
   good development practices, thorough testing, and proper maintenance
   policies, a non-negligible number of bugs remain in the released
   software. Understanding the type of residual bugs is fundamental for
   adopting proper countermeasures in current and future software releases.
   Depending on the fault triggering conditions that lead to a failure,
   developers can introduce fault-tolerance mechanisms and plan
   verification and validation strategies.
   In this paper, we analyze bugs in four large open-source software
   systems during their lifecycle, based on the concept of fault triggers.
   We first investigate how the type of system affects the bug type
   proportions, and their evolution over years. Then, an analysis of bug
   subtypes is performed, so as to better understand their nature, followed
   by a comparison with respect to attributes such as their average time to
   fix and severity.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of DNA strands available in a biological sample is a major
   limitation for many genomic bioanalyses. To amplify the traces of DNA
   strands, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used for conducting
   subsequent experiments. Compared to conventional instruments and
   analyzers, the execution of PCR on a digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB)
   can achieve short time-to-results, low reagent consumption, rapid
   heating/cooling rates, and high integration of multiple processing
   modules. However, the PCR biochip design methods in the literature are
   oblivious to the inherent randomness and complexity of bioanalyses, and
   they do not consider the interference among on-chip devices and the cost
   of droplet transportation. We present, for the first time, an integrated
   design method to optimize the complete PCR procedure, including (i) DNA
   amplification and termination control, (ii) resource placement that
   satisfies physical constraints needed to avoid interference, and (iii)
   droplet transportation needed for mixing and detection. We propose a
   statistical model for sensor feedback-driven (cyberphysical) on-line
   decision making in order to optimize and control the execution sequence
   for DNA amplification. Next, we present a geometric algorithm for layout
   design to avoid device interference and reduce the cost of droplet
   routing. Simulation results on three laboratory protocols demonstrate
   that the proposed design method results in a compact layout and produces
   an execution sequence for efficient control of PCR operations on a
   cyberphysical DMFB.}},

Abstract = {{A new discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Time Domain (DG-FETD) method
   for Maxwell's equations is developed. It can suppress spurious modes
   using basis functions based on polynomials with the same order of
   interpolation for electric field intensity E and magnetic flux density
   B. Compared to FETD based on EH scheme, which requires different orders
   of interpolation polynomials for electric and magnetic field
   intensities, this method uses fewer unknowns and reduces the computation
   load. The discontinuous Galerkin method is employed to implement domain
   decomposition for the EB scheme based FETD. In addition, a well-posed
   time-domain perfectly matched layer (PML) is extended to the EB scheme
   to simulate the unbounded problem. Leap frog method is utilized for
   explicit time stepping. Numerical results demonstrate that the above
   proposed methods are effective and efficient for 2D time domain TMz
   multi-domain problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel test generation technique for defective
   power TSV induced path delay faults in 3D IC. This paper provides a
   simple close-form analysis to show that, in a regular 3D power grid
   model, open defects in power TSV do not induce serious IR drop. However,
   leakage defects in power TSV should be tested, even though the number of
   power TSV is large. This paper proposes a test generation flow to detect
   path delay faults induced by defective power TSV. The proposed technique
   is demonstrated on an 18-tier, 7 x 7 multi-core 3D IC model. In the
   experiment of b18 and b19 benchmark circuits, all detectable path delay
   faults induced by power TSV can be tested by around hundred test
   patterns. This technique requires no extra DfT hardware overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Reseeding techniques have been adopted in BIST to enhance fault
   detectability and shorten test application time for integrated circuits.
   In order to achieve complete fault coverage, previous reseeding methods
   often need large storage space to store all required seeds. In this
   paper, we propose a new LFSR reseeding technique that employs the
   internal net responses of the circuit itself as the control signals to
   change the states of the LFSR. A novel test architecture containing a
   net selection logic module and an LFSR with some inversion logic is
   presented that can generate all required seeds on-chip in real time
   without any external or internal storage requirement. Experimental
   results on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that the presented technique
   can achieve 100\% stuck-at fault coverage in a short test time by using
   only 0.23-2.36\% of internal nets for reseeding control.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a source (Alice) trying to communicate with a destination
   (Bob), in a way that an unauthorized node (Eve) cannot infer, based on
   her observations, the information that is being transmitted. The
   communication is assisted by multiple multi-antenna cooperating nodes
   (helpers) who have the ability to move. While Alice transmits, the
   helpers transmit noise that is designed to affect the entire space
   except Bob. We consider the problem of selecting the helper weights and
   positions that maximize the system secrecy rate. It turns out that this
   optimization problem can be efficiently solved, leading to a novel
   decentralized helper motion control scheme. Simulations indicate that
   introducing helper mobility leads to considerable savings in terms of
   helper transmit power, as well as total number of helpers required for

Abstract = {{Compressed sensing (CS) theory promises one can recover real-valued
   sparse signal from a small number of linear measurements. Motivated by
   network monitoring with link failures, we for the first time consider
   the problem of recovering signals that contain both real-valued entries
   and corruptions, where the real entries represent transmission delays on
   normal links and the corruptions represent failed links. Unlike
   conventional CS, here a measurement is real-valued only if it does not
   include a failed link, and it is corrupted otherwise. We prove that O
   ((d + 1) max (d, k) log n) nonadaptive measurements are enough to
   recover all n-dimensional signals that contain k nonzero real entries
   and d corruptions. We provide explicit constructions of measurements and
   recovery algorithms. We also analyze the performance of signal recovery
   when the measurements contain errors.}},

Abstract = {{Game-theoretic methods based on Nash equilibria have been widely used in
   various fields including signal processing and communication
   applications such as cognitive radio systems, sensor networks, defense
   networks and gene regulatory networks. Solving the Nash equilibria,
   however, has been proven to be a difficult problem, in general. It is
   therefore desired to obtain efficient algorithms for solving the Nash
   equilibria in various special cases. In this paper, we propose a
   Compressed-Sensing Game Theory (CSGT) framework to solve the Nash
   equilibria. We demonstrate that the proposed CSGT framework provides a
   polynomial complexity solution to the Nash Equilibria, thus allowing
   more general pay-off functions for certain classes of two-player dynamic
   games. We also provide numerical examples that demonstrate the
   efficiency of proposed CSGT framework in solving the Nash equilibria for
   two-player games in comparison to existing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive Sensing is possible when the sensing matrix acts as a near
   isometry on signals of interest that can be sparsely or compressively
   represented. The attraction of greedy algorithms such as Orthogonal
   Matching Pursuit is their simplicity. However they fail to take
   advantage of both the structure of the sensing matrix and any prior
   information about the sparse signal. This paper introduces an oblique
   projector to matching pursuit algorithms to enhance detection of a
   component that is present in the signal by reducing interference from
   other candidate components based on prior information about the signal
   as well as the structure of the sensing matrix. Numerical examples
   demonstrate that performance as a function of SNR is superior to

Abstract = {{Stiffness is an important mechanical index for characterisation of human

   for passive mechanical characterisation of the ex-vivo C57BL/6 murine
   heart using the technique of nano-indentation with atomic force
   microscopy. It also investigates regional stiffness variability in
   sectioned left ventricular (LV) samples, and the existence of epicardial
   and endocardial stiffness differences. Experimental results demonstrate
   that no spatial differentiation, or variability in stiffness was
   observed in the various epicardial areas of the normal intact LV
   myocardium (spanning apical {[}27.4 +/- 2.3 kPa], middle {[}25.5 +/- 1.9
   kPa], and basal areas {[}21.4 +/- 1.1 kPa], p = NS). However, a
   transmural stiffness variation was noted in sectioned myocardial tissue
   (25.2 +/- 1.1 kPa for intact vs. 14.7 +/- 0.8 kPa for sectioned tissue,
   p<0.0001) with epicardial muscle stiffness shown to be significantly
   decreased compared to corresponding endocardial values (14.7 +/- 0.8 kPa
   vs. 25.9 +/- 3.5 kPa, p<0.0001). The study can be extended to identify
   relative passive force contributions in intact tissue or organs from
   cellular constituents and the extracellular matrix, investigate
   morphogenesis and development, and assess epicardial tissue stiffness
   changes post-stem cell therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of the level set of a function (i.e., regions where the
   function exceeds some value) is an important problem with applications
   in digital elevation mapping, medical imaging, astronomy, etc. In many
   applications, the function of interest is not observed directly. Rather,
   it is acquired through (linear) projection measurements, such as
   tomographic projections, interferometric measurements, coded-aperture
   measurements, and random projections associated with compressed sensing.
   This paper describes a new methodology for rapid and accurate estimation
   of the level set from such projection measurements. The key defining
   characteristic of the proposed method, called the projective level set
   estimator, is its ability to estimate the level set from projection
   measurements without an intermediate reconstruction step. This leads to
   significantly faster computation relative to heuristic ``plug-in{''}
   methods that first estimate the function, typically with an iterative
   algorithm, and then threshold the result. The paper also includes a
   rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed method, which utilizes
   results from the literature on concentration of measure and
   characterizes the estimator's performance in terms of geometry of the
   measurement operator and l(1)-norm of the discretized function.}},

Abstract = {{Microglia are the resident immune cell population in the mammalian
   central nervous system (CNS). These highly plastic cells exhibit
   ramified arbors in their resting state, and progressively less-complex
   arbors when activated. Our goal is to compare the spatial distributions
   of resting and activated microglia in normal brain tissue against tissue
   that is perturbed by insertion of a neural recording device. For this,
   microglia were imaged using multiplex immunostaining and confocal
   microscopy. The cell arbors were traced automatically, and 127
   quantitative measurements based on the L-measure {[}8] were computed for
   each cell. A hierarchical extension of Coifman's {[}1,2] unsupervised
   harmonic analysis method was used to profile these multivariate data and
   identify groups of similar cells and the underlying features. This
   iterative procedure induces an orthogonal basis by constructing a
   coupled geometry over the row and column spaces of the feature matrix.
   Smoothing of the dataset, and the row and column clusters is achieved
   simultaneously when the algorithm converges. Experiments on real image
   datasets demonstrate the ability of this method to generate qualitative
   and quantitative groups that are biologically meaningful despite the
   existence of noise and missing values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a new analytic model for the performance and
   reliability analysis of safety-related message broadcast in vehicular ad
   hoc networks (VANETs) at rural intersections. First, a semi-Markov
   process (SMP) model for characterizing channel behavior of IEEE 802.11
   based VANET is deployed to interact with the M/G/1 queue through
   fixed-point iteration. Then, the mean transmission delay between two
   nodes is derived. Furthermore, given two communicating nodes placed at
   the same intersection, the node reception probability that a node
   successfully receives the broadcast message from a sending node is
   computed. Consequently, the packet reception ratios are derived through
   integration of the node reception probabilities over the intended range
   of the sending node. The analytical model takes intersection geometry,
   IEEE 802.11 backoff counter process, hidden terminal problem, and
   non-saturated message arrival into account. From the obtained numerical
   results under various network parameters, the new model is validated and
   new observations are obtained.}},

   the western Antarctic Peninsula during autumn}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{494}},
Pages = {{281-289}},
Abstract = {{Most humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae populations partition their
   time between prey-rich feeding and prey-deficient breeding/calving
   regions. How these whales feed and optimize the consumption of prey
   resources prior to long-distance migrations and fasting is largely
   unknown. We deployed multi-sensor tags on humpback whales around the
   western Antarctic Peninsula to describe their daily activity patterns
   late in the feeding season to test the hypothesis that feeding behavior
   varies over the diel cycle so as to maximize energy intake and limit
   energy expenditure. Dives were assigned to a behavioral state (feeding,
   resting, traveling, exploring) to determine hourly rates and to build an
   ethogram of activity patterns. Our results show a distinct diel pattern
   of whales feeding exclusively at night. Feeding depth was deeper around
   sunrise/sunset and shallower (similar to 50 m) at night, consistent with
   diel vertical prey movement. Shallow feeding dives typically contained a
   single feeding lunge, a strategy known to increase feeding efficiency
   and maximize intake rates by maintaining proximity to the surface and
   reducing the energetic costs of deep diving. The lack of feeding during
   daytime may indicate prey being too deep for efficient foraging. Our
   results add information where currently there is a paucity of data
   describing how baleen whales optimize feeding behavior, specifically in
   relation to prey distribution and movement, to fuel their extraordinary
   energetic requirements necessary for growth, migration, and
   reproduction. Understanding behavioral patterns and predator/prey
   dynamics in rapidly changing marine environments, like the Antarctic
   Peninsula, is critical for understanding how these changes will affect
   ecosystem structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{Cyberphysical digital microfluidics enables the integration of
   fluid-handling operations, reaction-outcome detection, and
   software-based control in a biochip. However, synthesis algorithms and
   biochip design methods proposed in the literature are oblivious to
   completion-time uncertainties in fluidic operations, and they do not
   meet the requirements of cyberphysical integration in digital
   microfluidics. We present an operation-interdependency-aware synthesis
   method that uses frequency scaling and is responsive to uncertainties
   that are inherent in the completion times of fluidic operations such as
   mixing and thermal cycling. Using this design approach, we can carry out
   dynamic on-line decision making for the execution of fluidic operations
   in response to detector feedback. We use three common laboratorial
   protocols to demonstrate that, compared to uncertainty-oblivious biochip
   design, the proposed dynamic decision making approach is more effective
   in satisfying realistic physical constraints. As a result, it decreases
   the likelihood of erroneous reaction outcomes, and it leads to reduced
   time-to-results, less repetition of reaction steps, and less wastage of
   precious samples and reagents.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of cooperative beamforming in relay networks.
   Assuming knowledge of the second-order statistics of channel state
   information (CSI), the optimal beamforming weights are determined so
   that the total transmitted power at the relays is minimized, while
   meeting signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) requirements at
   the destinations. Our formulation utilizes the Semidefinite Relaxation
   (SDR) technique to produce an efficient, tractable convex programming
   approximation of the problem in centralized form. We propose a
   distributed optimization algorithm to calculate the optimal beamforming
   weights for scenarios where multiple clusters of source-destination node
   pairs, along with their dedicated relays, coexist in space. Our method
   relies on dual decomposition techniques with regularization, that can
   significantly improve on the inherent disadvantages of simple dual
   subgradient methods. Numerical anaysis demonstrates that the proposed
   algorithm exhibits very fast convergence rates.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the formulation of optimal numerical controllers
   for stochastically-excited vibratory energy harvesters in which a
   single-directional power electronic converter is used to regulate
   power-flow. Single-directional converters have implementation advantages
   for small-scale applications, but restrict the domain of feasible
   controllers. Optimizing the average power generated in such systems can
   be accomplished by formulating the constrained control problem in terms
   of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi theory. However, solving the stochastic
   Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) is challenging because it is a nonlinear
   partial differential equation. As such, we investigate the capability of
   the pseudospectral (PS) method to solve the HJE with mixed state-control
   constraints. The performance of the PS controller is computed for a
   single-degree-of-freedom resonant oscillator with electromagnetic
   coupling. We compare the PS performance to the performance of the
   optimal static admittance controller as well as the optimal
   unconstrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian controller.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{24794-24811}},
Abstract = {{Co-delivery is a rapidly growing sector of drug delivery that aspires to
   enhance therapeutic efficacy through controlled delivery of diverse
   therapeutic cargoes with synergistic activities. It requires the design
   of carriers capable of simultaneously transporting to and releasing
   multiple therapeutics at a disease site. Co-delivery has arisen from the
   emerging trend of combination therapy, where treatment with two or more
   therapeutics at the same time can succeed where single therapeutics
   fail. However, conventional combination therapy offers little control
   over achieving an optimized therapeutic ratio at the target site.
   Co-delivery via inclusion of multiple therapeutic cargos within the same
   carrier addresses this issue by not only ensuring delivery of both
   therapeutics to the same cell, but also offering a platform for control
   of the delivery process, from loading to release. Co-delivery systems
   have been formulated using a number of carriers previously developed for
   single-therapeutic delivery. Liposomes, polymeric micelles, PLGA
   nanoparticles, and dendrimers have all been adapted for co-delivery.
   Much of the effort focuses on dealing with drugs having dissimilar
   properties, increasing loading efficiencies, and controlling loading and
   release ratios. In this review, we highlight the innovations in carrier
   designs and formulations to deliver combination cargoes of drug/drug,
   drug/siRNA, and drug/pDNA toward disease therapy. With rapid advances in
   mechanistic understanding of interrelating molecular pathways and
   development of molecular medicine, the future of co-delivery will become
   increasingly promising and prominent.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the first fully passive (battery-free) wireless
   transmission of multiple digital audio channels and images via modulated
   backscatter. We leverage a previously reported single chip, passive
   transponder that can digitize and uplink up to 10 analog input channels
   sampled at a rate of 26.1 kHz. Given a base station transceiver
   operating at a frequency of 915 MHz and a transmit power of +36 dBm
   EIRP, the transponder has a demonstrated operating range of approximate
   to 1.4 m. The transponder data uplink uses binary phase-shift key (BPSK)
   modulated backscatter operating at a total link throughput rate of 5
   Mbps, with an uplink energy consumption of only 3.7 pJ/bit.
   The transponder was initially designed for biomedical telemetry of
   neural and EMG signals. We present a new application of this tag for
   multichannel, high fidelity digital audio recording, as well as color
   image transfer using a slow-scan television (SSTV) modulation (PD290)
   with a resolution of 640 by 493 pixels. Additionally, we demonstrate
   fully-passive digital recording of ambient sound using a microphone
   powered by the chip's harvested energy at an operating range of 0.72 m.
   The passive, digital microphone is sensitive enough to record human
   speech within approximately 5 m of the device. We believe these results
   will serve as a first step toward media-rich battery-free (wirelessly
   powered) devices that take advantage of the high speed, low power nature
   of modulated backscatter communication links.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for enhancing far-field wireless power transfer
   (WPT) to nonlinear, passive UHF RFID backscatter transponders using a
   multi-input multi-output (MIMO) base station. The proposed method does
   not require on-tag power measurements or on-tag channel estimation,
   either of which would add significant complexity and power consumption
   for microwatt-class wirelessly powered devices such as passive UHF RFID
   tags. We show in a measurement-based proof of concept that WPT
   optimization to nonlinear backscatter transponders is possible solely
   based on the backscatter signal, without knowledge of the incident power
   level at the tag or prior knowledge of the tag's characteristics. Using
   an 8x8 MIMO transceiver array to optimize power delivery, we observed an
   average WPT enhancement of 8.9 dB relative to an un-optimized
   8-transmitter configuration across a 50 m(3) volume in an office/lab
   environment. We also show that power to a given tag can be selectively
   denied, with a notch depth of - 106.4 dB (noise floor of the presented
   measurements). These results are comparable to values previously
   observed for linear backscatter transponders, and suggest that the use
   of MIMO interrogators could lead to improved forward-link performance
   and thus efficiently provide power for sensors or other new power-hungry
   functions on passive transponders.}},

   test cost remains a major concern, and analysis and tools are needed to
   understand test flows and minimize test cost. We propose a generic cost
   model to account for various test costs involved in 3D integration and
   present a heuristic solution to minimize the overall cost. In contrast
   to prior work, which is based on explicit enumeration of test flows, we
   adopt a formal optimization approach, which allows us to select an
   effective test flow by systematically exploring an exponentially large
   number of candidate test flows. Experimental results highlight the
   effectiveness of the proposed heuristic solution, which is compared to
   an exact approach for a small test case and to a random-selection

Abstract = {{Pre-bond known-good-die (KGD) test is necessary to ensure stack yield
   for the future adoption of 3D ICs. Die wrappers that contain boundary
   registers at the interface between dies have been proposed as a solution
   for known-good-die (KGD) test. It has been shown in the literature that
   if gated scan flops (GSFs) are substituted for traditional scan flops in
   the boundary register, then both pre-bond TSV and pre-bond scan test can
   be performed. The drawback of die wrappers is that two clocked stages
   are added to each path that crosses a die boundary. In this paper, a
   bypass mode is added to GSFs to avoid the extra clock stages and
   retiming is used to recover the additional delay added to
   through-silicon-via (TSV) paths by design-for-test (DfT) insertion. The
   proposed method is evaluated through simulations using a logic-on-logic
   3D benchmark. Results show that in most cases, retiming at both the
   die-level and stack-level is sufficient for recovering the delay added
   by wrapper boundary cells. Stuck-at ATPG is performed to demonstrate
   that wrapper insertion and retiming have little impact on pattern count.
   The area overhead due to wrapper insertion is shown to increase as a
   circuit is partitioned across an increasing number of stack layers, but
   the area overhead can be reduced using retiming.}},

Abstract = {{While foams are widely used for absorbing kinetic energy, their
   capacities of energy absorption are generally not tunable in
   applications. In this paper, Magneto-rheological elastomers have been
   fabricated into the form of foams. Here, we show that the
   magneto-rheological foams can significantly vary their capacities of
   energy absorption in response to uniform magnetic fields. We develop a
   theoretical model to account for the magneto-mechanical properties of
   magneto-rheological foams. We find that the tunable energy absorption of
   magneto-rheological foams is mainly attributed to the Maxwell stress
   induced by the applied magnetic field. The theoretical prediction
   matches well with experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Rain and cloud fields produced by fully nonlinear idealized cloud
   resolving numerical simulations of orographic convective precipitation
   display statistical multiscaling behavior, implying that multifractal
   diagnostics should provide a physically robust basis for the downscaling
   and sub-grid scale parameterizations of moist processes. Our results
   show that the horizontal scaling exponent function (and respective
   multiscaling parameters) of the simulated rainfall and cloud fields
   varies with atmospheric and terrain properties, particularly small-scale
   terrain spectra, atmospheric stability, and advective timescale. This
   implies that multifractal diagnostics of moist processes for these
   simulations are fundamentally transient, exhibiting complex nonlinear
   behavior depending on atmospheric conditions and terrain forcing at each
   location. A particularly robust behavior found here is the transition of
   the multifractal parameters between stable and unstable cases, which has
   a clear physical correspondence to the transition from stratiform to
   organized (banded and cellular) convective regime. This result is
   reinforced by a similar behavior in the horizontal spectral exponent.
   Finally, our results indicate that although nonlinearly coupled fields
   (such as rain and clouds) have different scaling exponent functions,
   there are robust relationships with physical underpinnings between the
   scaling parameters that can be explored for hybrid dynamical-statistical
   downscaling.}},

   without the need for fixing, sectioning, and staining. The potential of

   Our solution is to apply sparse decomposition (SD) to monochrome images
   of fluorescently-stained microanatomy to segment and quantify distinct
   tissue types. The clinical utility of our approach is demonstrated by
   imaging excised margins in a cohort of mice after surgical resection of
   a sarcoma. Representative images of excised margins were used to
   optimize the formulation of SD and tune parameters associated with the
   algorithm. Our results demonstrate that SD is a robust solution that can

Abstract = {{Gigapixel cameras using lens arrays can contain hundreds to thousands of
   precisely positioned optical components and thus require fast, reliable
   methods for optical assembly and alignment verification. Our first
   one-gigapixel prototype camera (AWARE-2) and our four-gigapixel camera
   currently under development (AWARE-10) need active alignment and
   performance measurement procedures during assembly to ensure high
   quality images. Here we describe the methods that we have developed to
   ensure proper positioning of all optical components in the AWARE-10
   system and the resulting optomechanical design decisions. AWARE cameras
   employ a single monocentric objective lens that is shared by an array of
   smaller ``micro-cameras{''}, each composed of a set of smaller scale
   lenses. In AWARE-10, approximately two thousand pieces of individual
   optics must be aligned to a high level of accuracy in order to attain
   the desired optical resolution over four gigapixels. To guarantee proper
   alignment before final assembly, the objective lens and the micro-optics
   are checked separately. Using tools including auto-stigmatic microscopy,
   slanted edge MTF measurements, and flat field measurements, we can
   confirm the correct alignment of individual components before assembly.
   Optomechanical designs that incorporate the application of these
   alignment tools are described.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional wisdom in ultrasonic array design drives development
   towards larger arrays because of the inverse relationship between
   aperture size and resolution. We propose a method using synthetic
   aperture beamforming to study image quality as a function of aperture
   size in simulation, in a phantom and in vivo. A single data acquisition
   can be beamformed to produce matched images with a range of aperture
   sizes, even in the presence of target motion. In this framework we
   evaluate the reliability of typical image quality metrics - speckle
   signal-to-noise ratio, contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio - for use in
   in vivo studies. Phantom and simulation studies are in good agreement in
   that there exists a point of diminishing returns in image quality at
   larger aperture sizes. We demonstrate challenges in applying and
   interpreting these metrics in vivo, showing results in hypoechoic
   vasculature regions. We explore the use of speckle brightness to
   describe image quality in the presence of in vivo clutter and underlying
   tissue inhomogeneities.}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidic biochips are recently being developed for on-chip
   implementation of biochemical laboratory assays. Existing mixing
   algorithms determine the mixing tree or mixing graph from a given target
   ratio of several biochemical fluids for on-chip mixture preparation. We
   present an algorithm to determine a reduced mixing tree by sharing the
   common subtrees within itself. We observe two transformations that
   preserve the semantics of the tree: (a) permutation of leaf nodes (input
   fluids/reagents) within the same level of a mixing tree, and (b)
   level-shifting of a leaf node to the next lower level by duplicating its
   appearance. The proposed algorithm utilizes both the intermediate
   droplets obtained after a split operation when a pair of identical
   subtrees are identified under permutation of leaf nodes at the same
   level. Simulation results for a large set of target ratios show that our
   algorithm reduces the mean values of the total number of mix-split
   steps, waste droplets and the number of mixer modules required for
   earliest completion by 16\%, 29\% and 12\% over Min-Mix and by 22\%,
   34\% and 20\% over RMA, respectively. Moreover, it reduces the number of
   checkpoint insertions required for dynamic error recovery against
   incorrect mix-split steps during mixture preparation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a decentralized control algorithm for the
   Entrapment/Escorting Mission based on the Morse potential function. The
   entrapment/escorting mission tasks a multi-agent system with creating a
   formation around a mobile target. Applications of the mission include
   security awareness and military situations where an autonomous object of
   value must be guarded. The simulation consists of N robots that are
   initially located in random positions on a flat terrain. Agents are
   provided with the information on coordinates of their peers by a
   supervisor, which are used to generate artificial potential energies
   between robots and the target. The simulation confirms that robot
   positions achieve the lowest calculated Morse potential energy in the
   arena, and the resulting formation is centered on the target.
   Differential drive ``e-puck{''} robots are used to experimentally
   validate the control's application to nonholonomic vehicles, and
   proximity sensors are incorporated into the algorithm to accommodate for
   obstacles in the experimental arena:}},

Abstract = {{The study of intact, living cells using non-invasive optical
   spectroscopic methods offers the opportunity to assess cellular
   structure and organization in a way that is not possible with commonly
   used cell biology imaging techniques. We have developed a novel
   spectroscopic technique for diagnosing disease at the cellular level
   based on using low-coherence interferometry (LCI) to detect the angular
   distribution of scattered light. Angle-resolved LCI (a/LCI) combines the
   ability of LCI to isolate scattering from sub-surface tissue layers with
   the ability of light scattering spectroscopy to obtain structural
   information on sub-wavelength scales. In application to examining
   cellular structure, a/LCI enables quantitative measurements of changes
   in the size and texture of cell nuclei. These quantitative measurements
   are characteristic of different pathological states. The capabilities of
   a/LCI were demonstrated using a clinical system that can be applied in
   endoscopic surveillance of esophageal tissue, producing high sensitivity
   and specificity for detecting dysplastic tissues in vivo. Experiments
   with in vitro cell samples also show the utility of a/LCI in observing
   structural changes due to environmental stimuli as well as detecting
   apoptosis due to chemotherapeutic agents.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a fully distributed, scalable method of
   controlling agents with nonholonomic constraints using a Morse potential
   function. This method successfully controls a swarm of
   differential-drive (unicycle-type) agents to stable and predictable
   formations whose structures are not defined a priori. The system
   achieves a stable, minimal energy state.
   We consider the effect of numerosity constraints, as observed in birds
   and fish in their shoaling and flocking behavior as a mechanism of
   reducing complexity, in the interest of achieving fully distributed
   control over a swarm of any size. The application of numerosity
   constraints to a swarm system allows the swarm to grow without bound and
   with no increase in required processing capability of the individual
   agents. We explore this parameter as a method of minimizing processing
   and storage requirements while still achieving the qualitative swarm
   performance. Results from simulations are given for swarms ranging in
   size over N=\{6,...,100\} acting under our proposed controller as
   applied to differential-drive (unicycle-type) robots.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic fields can generate orientation-dependent, long range
   interactions between colloidal components that direct their assembly
   into highly ordered structures, such as small ordered clusters, chains,
   and large crystalline lattices. While much effort has been devoted to
   exploring the assembly of spherical colloids, few reports have
   investigated the directed assembly of non-spherical particles with Janus
   or patchy morphologies. Here, we use photolithographic techniques to
   fabricate a wide range of anisotropically shaped patchy particles and
   follow their assembly in liquid suspensions under the influence of
   electric and magnetic fields. We analyze the assembly of several types
   of patchy particles across a range of field parameters and fluid
   compositions, and report a number of distinct, well-ordered, assembly
   architectures including cylindrical, prismatic, and staggered chains.
   The structures assembled from anisotropic patchy components provide a
   glimpse into the range of architectures that can be created by combining
   field directed assembly with rationally designed particles. By using
   numerical simulations to model the electric and magnetic field
   interactions between these particles, we interpret the results of the
   assembly process and explain how they can be controlled by the position
   of the metal facet, the frequency (for AC fields), or magnetic
   susceptibility of the medium. The resulting structures, and similar ones
   produced through the field-directed assembly of patchy anisotropic
   particles, can possess unique electrical and optical properties and may
   have potential applications in a number of future technology
   applications such as microactuators, metamaterials and multiferroic
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras have recently been studied as a
   sensing modality for use in buried threat detection systems. FLIR-based
   detection systems benefit from larger standoff distances and faster
   rates of advance than other sensing modalities, but they also present
   significant signal processing challenges. FLIR imagery typically yields
   multiple looks at each surface area, each of which is obtained from a
   different relative camera pose and position. This multi-look imagery can
   be exploited for improved performance, however open questions remain as
   to the best ways to process and fuse such data. Further, the utility of
   each look in the multi-look imagery is also unclear: How many looks are
   needed, from what poses, etc? In this work we propose a general
   framework for processing FLIR imagery wherein FLIR imagery is
   partitioned according to the particular relative camera pose from which
   it was collected. Each partition is then projected into a common spatial
   coordinate system resulting in several distinct images of the surface
   area. Buried threat detection algorithms can then be applied to each of
   these resulting images independently, or in aggregate. The proposed
   framework is evaluated using several detection algorithms on an FLIR
   dataset collected at a Western US test site and the results indicate
   that the framework offers significant improvement over detection in the
   original FLIR imagery. Further experiments using this framework suggest
   that multiple looks by the FLIR camera can be used to improve detection
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used technology for the
   detection of subsurface buried threats. Although GPR data contains a
   representation of 3D space, during training, target and false alarm
   locations are usually only provided in 2D space along the surface of the
   earth. To overcome uncertainty in target depth location, many algorithms
   simply extract features from multiple depth regions that are then
   independently used to make mine/non-mine decisions. A similar technique
   is employed in hidden Markov models (HMM) based landmine detection. In
   this approach, sequences of downtrack GPR responses over multiple depth
   regions are utilized to train an HMM, which learns the probability of a
   particular sequence of GPR responses being generated by a buried target.
   However, the uncertainty in object depth complicates learning for
   discriminating targets/non-targets since features at the (unknown)
   target depth can be significantly different from features at other
   depths but in the same volume. To mitigate the negative impact of the
   uncertainty in object depth, mixture models based on Multiple Instance
   Learning (MIL) have previously been developed. MIL is also applicable in
   the landmine detection problem using HMMs because features that are
   extracted independently from sequences of GPR signals over several depth
   bins can be viewed as a set of unlabeled time series, where the entire
   set either corresponds to a buried threat or a false alarm. In this
   work, a novel framework termed as multiple instance hidden Markov model
   (MIHMM) is developed. We show that the performance of the proposed
   approach for discriminating targets from non-targets in GPR data is
   promising.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing methods from the image processing and computer vision fields
   has led to advances in high resolution Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
   based threat detection. By analyzing 2-D slices of GPR data and applying
   various image processing algorithms, it is possible to discriminate
   between threat and non-threat objects. In initial attempts to utilize
   such approaches, object instance-matching algorithms were applied to GPR
   images, but only limited success was obtained when utilizing feature
   point methods to identify patches of data that displayed landmine-like
   characteristics. While the approach worked well under some conditions,
   the instance-matching method of classification was not designed to
   identify a type of class, only reproductions of a specific instance. In
   contrast, our current approach is focused on identifying methods that
   can account for within-class variations that result from changing target
   types and varying operating conditions that a GPR system regularly
   encounters. Image category recognition is an area of research that
   attempts to account for within class variation of objects within visual
   images. Instead of finding a reproduction of a particular known object
   within an image, algorithms for image categorization are designed to
   learn the qualities of images that contain an instance belonging to a
   known class. The results illustrate how image category recognition
   algorithms can be successfully applied to threat identification in GPR
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency-domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors have been shown
   to provide target signatures which enable discrimination of landmines
   from harmless clutter. In particular, frequency-domain EMI sensors are
   well-suited for target characterization by inverting a physics-based
   signal model. In many model-based signal processing paradigms, the
   target signatures can be decomposed into a weighted sum of parameterized
   basis functions, where the basis functions are intrinsic to the target
   under consideration and the associated weights are a function of the
   target sensor orientation. When sensor array data is available, the
   spatial diversity of the measured signals may provide more information
   for estimating the basis function parameters. After model inversion, the
   basis function parameters can form the foundation of model-based
   classification of the target as landmine or clutter. In this work,
   sparse model inversion of spatial frequency-domain EMI sensor array data
   followed by target classification using a statistical model is
   investigated. Results for data measured with a prototype
   frequency-domain EMI sensor at a standardized test site are presented.
   Preliminary results indicate that extracting physics-based features from
   spatial frequency-domain EMI sensor array data followed by statistical
   classification provides an effective approach for classifying targets as
   landmine or clutter.}},

Abstract = {{The monochromatic single frame pixel count of a camera is limited by
   diffraction to the space-bandwidth product, roughly the aperture area
   divided by the square of the wavelength. We have recently shown that it
   is possible to approach this limit using multiscale lenses for cameras
   with space bandwidth product between 1 and 100 gigapixels. When color,
   polarization, coherence and time are included in the image data cube,
   camera information capacity may exceed 1 petapixel/second. This talk
   reviews progress in the construction of DARPA AWARE gigapixel cameras
   and describes compressive measurement strategies that may be used in
   combination with multiscale systems to push camera capacity to near
   physical limits.}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale parallel imaging-based on a monocentric optical
   design-promises revolutionary advances in diverse imaging applications
   by enabling high resolution, real-time image capture over a wide
   field-of-view (FOV), including sport broadcast, wide-field microscopy,
   astronomy, and security surveillance. Recently demonstrated AWARE-2(1)
   is a gigapixel camera consisting of an objective lens and 98
   microcameras spherically arranged to capture an image over FOV of 120
   degrees by 50 degrees, using computational image processing to form a
   composite image of 0.96 gigapixels. Since microcameras are capable of
   individually adjusting exposure, gain, and focus, true parallel imaging
   is achieved with a high dynamic range. From the integration perspective,
   manufacturing and verifying consistent quality of microcameras is a key
   to successful realization of AWARE cameras. We have developed an
   efficient testing methodology that utilizes a precisely fabricated dot
   grid chart as a calibration target to extract critical optical
   properties such as optical distortion, veiling glare index, and
   modulation transfer function to validate imaging performance of
   microcameras. This approach utilizes an AWARE objective lens simulator
   which mimics the actual objective lens but operates with a short object
   distance, suitable for a laboratory environment. Here we describe the
   principles of the methodologies developed for AWARE microcameras and
   discuss the experimental results with our prototype microcameras.}},

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates Ultra Wide Band (UWB) response of a
   self-actuated electromagnetic wave shield based on a diode grid both in
   frequency and time domain. The investigation is first carried out on a
   shield valid for an incident wave polarized at a specific direction
   only, then extended to a shield effective for an incident wave polarized
   at an arbitrary direction. In the frequency domain, two linear analysis
   methods are used to study the properties of the diode grid over the
   frequency range from 0.01 to 10 GHz. One method is the microwave network
   analysis. Another is simulating the diode grid by a linear equivalent
   circuit instead of a diode. In the time domain, the property of the
   shield is studied with respect to a broadband impulse, where the diode
   is described by its SPICE circuit model including the nonlinear
   property. The results show that the diode grid works well as a
   self-actuated electromagnetic power selective surface (PSS) in a certain
   frequency range. The diode grid is strongly frequency dependent. The
   operating frequency band relies on the reactive elements in the diode
   grid. In order to extend the operating frequency to a high band, smaller
   cell size and smaller junction capacitance should be employed.}},

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{341-351}},
Abstract = {{Adaptive beamforming methods degrade in the presence of model mismatch.
   In this paper, we develop a modified interference covariance matrix
   reconstruction based beamformer that is robust against large array
   calibration errors. The calibration errors can come from the element
   position errors, and/or amplitude and phase errors, etc.. The proposed
   method is based on the fact that the sample covariance matrix can
   approximate the interference covariance matrix properly when the desired
   signal is small, and a reconstructed covariance matrix based on the
   Capon spectral will be better than the sample covariance matrix when the
   desired signal is large. A weighted summation of two covariance matrices
   in references is used to reconstruct the interference covariance matrix.
   Moreover, a computationally efficient convex optimization-based
   algorithm is used to estimate the mismatch of the steering vector
   associated with the desired signal. Several simulation cases are applied
   to show the superiority of the proposed method over other robust
   adaptive beamformers.}},

Title = {{Cell mediated contraction in 3D cell-matrix constructs leads to
   spatially regulated osteogenic differentiation}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1174-1183}},
Abstract = {{During embryonic development, morphogenetic processes give rise to a
   variety of shapes and patterns that lead to functional tissues and
   organs. While the impact of chemical signals on these processes is
   widely studied, the role of physical cues is less understood. The aim of
   this study was to test the hypothesis that the interplay of cell
   mediated contraction and mechanical boundary conditions alone can result
   in spatially regulated differentiation in simple 3D constructs. An
   experimental model consisting of a 3D cell-gel construct and a finite
   element (FE) model were used to study the effect of cellular traction
   exerted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on an initially homogeneous
   matrix under inhomogeneous boundary conditions. A robust shape change is
   observed due to contraction under time-varying mechanical boundary
   conditions, which is explained by the finite element model. Furthermore,
   distinct local differences in osteogenic differentiation are observed,
   with a spatial pattern independent of osteogenic factors in the culture
   medium. Regions that are predicted to have experienced relatively high
   shear stress at any time during contraction correlate with the regions
   of distinct osteogenesis. Taken together, these results support the
   underlying hypothesis that cellular contractility and mechanical
   boundary conditions alone can result in spatially regulated
   differentiation. These results will have important implications for
   tissue engineering and regeneration.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{501-510}},
Abstract = {{A diverse range of drug delivery vehicles have been developed to
   specifically target chemotherapeutics to solid tumours while avoiding
   systemic dose-limiting toxicity. Many of these active targeting
   strategies display limited efficacy because they rely on subtle
   differences in expression patterns between pathogenic tissue and healthy
   tissue. In contrast, drug delivery systems that exploit thermoresponsive
   behaviour allow a clinician to spatially and temporally control the
   accumulation and/or release of the toxic agents within tumour tissue by
   simply applying mild hyperthermia (defined as 39-43 degrees C) to the
   desired site. Although thermally sensitive materials comprise a
   significant portion of the literature on novel drug delivery systems,
   only a few systems have been methodically tuned to respond within this
   narrowly defined physiological temperature range in an in vivo
   environment. This review discusses the materials and strategies
   developed to control the primary tumour through the combined application

Title = {{A method to convert MRI images of temperature change into images of
   absolute temperature in solid tumours}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{569-581}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: During hyperthermia (HT), the therapeutic response of tumours
   varies substantially within the target temperature range (39-43 degrees
   C). Current thermometry methods are either invasive or measure only
   temperature change, which limits the ability to study tissue responses
   to HT. This study combines manganese-containing low temperature
   sensitive liposomes (Mn-LTSL) with proton resonance frequency shift
   (PRFS) thermometry to measure absolute temperature in tumours with high
   spatial and temporal resolution using MRI.
   Methods: Liposomes were loaded with 300mM MnSO4. The phase transition
   temperature (T-m) of Mn-LTSL samples was measured by differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC). The release of manganese from Mn-LTSL in
   saline was characterised with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
   spectroscopy. A 2T GE small animal scanner was used to acquire dynamic
   T-1-weighted images and temperature change images of Mn-LTSL in saline
   phantoms and fibrosarcoma-bearing Fisher-344 rats receiving hyperthermia
   after Mn-LTSL injection.
   Results: The Tm of Mn-LTSL in rat blood was 42.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C
   (DSC). For Mn-LTSL samples (0.06mM-0.5mM Mn2+ in saline) heated
   monotonically from 30 degrees C to 50 degrees C, a peak in the rate of
   MRI signal enhancement occurred at 43.1 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C. The
   same peak in signal enhancement rate was observed during heating of
   fibrosarcoma tumours (N 3) after injection of Mn-LTSL, and the peak was
   used to convert temperature change images into absolute temperature.
   Accuracies of calibrated temperature measurements were in the range
   0.9-1.8 degrees C.
   Conclusion: The release of Mn2+ from Mn-LTSL affects the rate of MR
   signal enhancement which enables conversion of MRI-based temperature
   change images to absolute temperature.}},

Abstract = {{While great advances are made toward making highly realistic, surface
   models of the human anatomy, very little has been done to fill these
   bounded surfaces with models of anatomical texture. We propose a method
   whereby realistic anatomically-based computed tomography (CT) texture
   can be incorporated into voxelized versions of the 4D extended
   cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom. Our source of texture comes from patient
   CT scans from the Duke CT imaging database. These image-sets were
   de-noised using anisotropic diffusion. Two organs were selected from
   which texture was obtained, liver and lungs. From each organ, multiple
   regions of interest (ROIs) were taken and tiled side-by-side to create a
   larger image. Textures for the liver and lungs were extrapolated using
   ImageQuilting, based on the tiled images. Next, a NURBS-based XCAT
   phantom was voxelized at the same resolution as the textures. The
   texture was then placed in the voxelized phantoms. Finally, CT
   simulations of the phantoms with and without the textures were compared
   against each other, using the power spectral density. This work shows
   that there is a way whereby the XCAT phantoms can be textured to give
   more realistic appearance in CT simulations. It is anticipated that this
   method would find great use in making projections of the XCAT phantom
   look more realistic and allow for the phantoms to not only be utilized
   in dosimetrical evaluations, but in image quality studies as well.}},

Abstract = {{Dual energy digital mammography has been used to suppress specific
   breast tissue, primarily for the purpose of iodine contrast-enhanced
   imaging. Another application of dual energy digital mammography is to
   estimate breast density, as defined by the fraction of glandular tissue,
   by suppressing adipose tissue. Adipose equivalent phantoms were used to
   derive the weighting factor for dual energy subtraction at 2, 4, 6, and
   8 cm thickness. For each thickness besides 8 cm, measurements were taken
   over a range of densities (0, 50, and 100\%) and used for calibration
   measurements to model a density map. Once the density map was verified
   with uniform slabs, the density map was evaluated with 50/50 CIRS 020
   phantom at 2, 4, and 6 cm thickness and demonstrated the feasibility of
   using dual energy subtraction to estimate breast density on complex

Abstract = {{In this work, we demonstrate the ability to determine the material
   composition of a sample by measuring coherent scatter diffraction
   patterns generated using a coded-aperture x-ray scatter imaging (CAXSI)
   system. Most materials are known to exhibit unique diffraction patterns
   through coherent scattering of low-energy x-rays. However, clinical
   x-ray imagers typically discard scatter radiation as noise that degrades
   image quality. Through the addition of a coded aperture, the system can
   be sensitized to coherent scattered photons that carry information about
   the identity and location of the scattering material. In this work, we
   demonstrate this process using a Monte-Carlo simulation of a CAXSI
   system. A simulation of a CAXSI system was developed in GEANT4 with
   modified physics libraries to model coherent scatter diffraction
   patterns in materials. Simulated images were generated from 10 materials
   including plastics, hydrocarbons, and biological tissue. The materials
   were irradiated using collimated pencil- and fan-beams with energies of
   160 kVp. The diffraction patterns were imaged using a simulated 2D
   detector and mathematically deconstructed using an analytical projection
   model that accounted for the known x-ray source spectrum. The
   deconstructed diffraction patterns were then matched with a library of
   known coherent scatter form-factors of different materials to determine
   the identity of the scatterer at different locations in the object. The
   results showed good agreement between the measured and known scatter
   patterns from the materials, demonstrating the ability to image and
   identify materials at different 3D locations within an object using a
   projection-based CAXSI system.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate how different implementations
   of the tube current modulation (TCM) technology affect organ dose
   conversion factors in chest CT and how organ dose can be accurately
   estimated for various modulation schemes. Computational phantom of a
   normal-weight female patient was used. A method was developed to
   generate tube current (mA) modulation profiles based on the attenuation
   of the phantom, taking into account the geometry of the CT system as
   well as the x-ray energy spectrum and bowtie filtration in a CT scan.
   The mA for a given projection angle was calculated as a power-law
   function of the attenuation along this projection. The exponent of this
   function, termed modulation control strength, was varied from 0 to 1 to
   emulate the effects of different TCM schemes. Organ dose was estimated
   for a chest scan for each modulation scheme and was subsequently
   normalized by volume-weighted CT dose index (CTDIvol) to obtain
   conversion factors. The results showed that the conversion factors are
   second-order polynomial functions of the modulation control strength.
   The conversion factors established for a fixed-mA scan may be used to
   estimate organ dose in a TCM scan. For organs on the periphery of the
   scan coverage, the best accuracy is achieved when using CTDIvol computed
   from the average mA of the entire scan. For organs inside the scan
   coverage, the best accuracy is achieved when using CTDIvol computed from
   the volume-averaged mA values of all the axial slices containing the
   organ.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a projection-based
   dose metric that enables computationally efficient dose estimation. The
   two physical quantities determining dose, absorbed energy and mass, were
   estimated in projection space. The absorbed energy was estimated using
   the difference between the imparted energy and detected energy. The mass
   was estimated using the area under the attenuation profile. A series of
   phantom simulations were conducted to test the metric's applicability
   for multi-material phantoms, different kVp settings, and bowtie filters.
   Projection-based dose estimates were benchmarked against results from
   the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The projection-based dose metric shows
   a strong linear correlation with MC dose estimates (R-2 > 0.96). The
   prediction errors for projection-based dose metric are below 14\%. This
   study demonstrates a computationally efficient and relatively accurate
   dose estimation method based on the projection data. It further suggests
   the possibility to achieve real-time and patient-specific dose
   optimization when applied prior to a CT scan.}},

Abstract = {{There are three main x-ray based modalities for imaging the thorax:
   radiography, tomosynthesis, and CT. CT provides perhaps the highest
   level of feature resolution but at notably higher radiation dose. To
   implement the ALARA (as low as reasonable achievable) principle in
   making an appropriate choice between standard chest projection imaging,
   tomosynthesis, and CT to achieve the lowest possible dose to patients,
   the effective doses and risk indices for each modality should be
   accurately known. In this study, we employed 59 computational
   anthropomorphic male and female extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) adult
   phantoms and a Monte Carlo simulation program (PENELOPE, version 2006,
   Universitat de Barcelona, Spain). Effective dose and risk index was
   estimated for a clinical radiography system enabling to conduct chest
   radiography and tomosynthesis sweep (Definium 8000, Volume RAD, GE
   Healthcare) and a clinical CT system (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare). It
   was found that the absolute effective dose and risk index increased
   greatly with increasing patient size for CT, while these two dose
   metrics only increased slightly for radiography and tomosynthesis. This
   suggests that it is important to specify patient size when comparing
   radiation dose across imaging modalities.}},

Abstract = {{Joint injury dramatically enhances the onset of osteoarthritis (OA) and
   is responsible for an estimated 12\% of OA. Posttraumatic arthritis
   (PTA) is especially common after intra-articular fracture, and no
   disease-modifying therapies are currently available. We hypothesized
   that the delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would prevent PTA by
   altering the balance of inflammation and regeneration after fracture of
   the mouse knee. Additionally, we examined the hypothesis that MSCs from
   the MRL/MpJ (MRL) ``superhealer{''} mouse strain would show increased
   multilineage and therapeutic potentials as compared to those from
   C57BL/6 (B6) mice, as MRL mice have shown exceptional in vivo
   regenerative abilities. A highly purified population of MSCs was
   prospectively isolated from bone marrow using cell surface markers
   (CD45(-)/TER119(-)/PDGFR alpha W+/Sca-1(+)). B6 MSCs expanded greater
   than 100,000-fold in 3 weeks when cultured at 2\% oxygen and displayed
   greater adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation as
   compared to MRL MSCs. Mice receiving only a control saline injection
   after fracture demonstrated PTA after 8 weeks, but the delivery of
   10,000 B6 or MRL MSCs to the joint prevented the development of PTA.
   Cytokine levels in serum and synovial fluid were affected by treatment

Abstract = {{We present an efficient method for enhancing far-field wireless power
   transfer (WPT) to highly power-constrained mobile devices such as UHF
   and microwave RFID transponders using a multiple-input-multiple-output
   (MIMO) base station system. Existing techniques for channel estimation
   are prohibitively complex and consume too much power to be integrated
   into milliwatt- or microwatt-class wirelessly powered devices. We show
   that power transfer can be optimized using a transponder's backscatter
   signal alone, without requiring channel estimation and power measurement
   circuitry on the transponder. A measurement-based proof of concept is
   presented, illustrating that for any linear backscatter transponder,
   power optimization based on the backscattered signal is equivalent to
   local measurement at the mobile device itself. Using an 8 x 8 MIMO
   transceiver array to optimize power delivery across 100 randomly chosen
   locations in our office environment, we observe an average WPT
   enhancement of 8.1 dB relative to an unoptimized transmitter
   configuration. Transponders with nonlinear power harvesters can easily
   be supported with the addition of a single RF switching transistor.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC MAMMALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{174-186}},
Abstract = {{Construction and demolition activities are commonplace in offshore and
   coastal waters, in habitats that are important feeding and breeding
   grounds for marine mammals. In Sarasota Bay, Florida, the construction
   of a large fixed-span bridge was completed in July 2003, followed by two
   in-air explosions and a final underwater explosion to demolish the
   pre-existing drawbridge. Boat-based surveys were conducted to compare
   distribution of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) sightings during
   bridge construction and demolition to historical sighting records.
   Additionally, underwater sound pressure levels were monitored at six
   listening stations to the north and south of the bridge. Dolphin density
   in the vicinity of the bridge was significantly higher after
   construction was completed than during construction. The few bottlenose
   dolphins that used the waters in the general vicinity of the bridge
   during construction did not appear to avoid the bridge, suggesting that
   some bottlenose dolphins may still have preferred the habitat around the
   bridge despite the construction and demolition noise. During the
   underwater detonation, the small sample of observed bottlenose dolphins
   decreased nearest neighbor distance, increased group size, and exhibited
   heading changes. The underwater explosion, which was contained by a
   steel coffer-cell, was quieter under water than were both in-air
   explosions, also measured under water. Based on these results, in-air
   explosions occurring close to water level (< 5 m) should be considered
   for their potential to effect marine mammals. These explosions and
   persistent noise associated with construction and/or demolition
   operations could have contributed to the change in density of the
   bottlenose dolphins observed near the bridge.}},

   often complicated by a limited range of miscibility. The current
   research has focused on the properties, stability, and detailed
   chemistry required to realize these materials. The use of synthetic
   conditions that permit the growth of these alloys to be dominated by

Abstract = {{An integrated design of the adaptive robust control and the fault
   identification for a linear system with actuator faults is proposed.
   When actuators suffer from unpredicted faults, the proposed control
   strategy can track the actuator fault parameters adaptively without any
   prior fault information, and guarantee the robustness of the faulty
   system. An unknown input observer is designed to decouple the
   disturbance and the actuator faults. Then an adaptive control law with
   projection is presented to track the fault parameters. A new definition
   of robust H-infinity-like performance is proposed to ensure that the
   system is robust for both exogenous disturbance and unpredicted faults.
   Then the adaptive robust control law is designed to guarantee the system
   satisfying the robust H-infinity-like performance. Finally, the
   effectiveness of this control strategy is illustrated through the
   fault-tolerant longitudinal control of the simplified F-18 aircraft
   model.}},

Abstract = {{A microcamera is a relay lens paired with image sensors. Microcameras
   are grouped into arrays to relay overlapping views of a single large
   surface to the sensors to form a continuous synthetic image. The imaged
   surface may be curved or irregular as each camera may independently be
   dynamically focused to a different depth. Microcamera arrays are akin to
   microprocessors in supercomputers in that both join individual
   processors by an optoelectronic routing fabric to increase capacity and
   performance. A microcamera may image ten or more megapixels and grouped
   into an array of several hundred, as has already been demonstrated by
   the DARPA AWARE Wide-Field program with multiscale gigapixel
   photography. We adapt gigapixel microcamera array architectures to
   wide-field microscopy of irregularly shaped surfaces to greatly increase
   area imaging over 1000 square millimeters at resolutions of 3 microns or
   better in a single snapshot. The system includes a novel relay design, a
   sensor electronics package, and a FPGA-based networking fabric.
   Biomedical applications of this include screening for skin lesions,
   wide-field and resolution-agile microsurgical imaging, and microscopic
   cytometry of millions of cells performed in situ.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a recursive estimation procedure for multivariate
   binary densities (probability distributions of vectors of Bernoulli
   random variables) using orthogonal expansions. For d covariates, there
   are 2(d) basis coefficients to estimate, which renders conventional
   approaches computationally prohibitive when d is large. However, for a
   wide class of densities that satisfy a certain sparsity condition, our
   estimator runs in probabilistic polynomial time and adapts to the
   unknown sparsity of the underlying density in two key ways: (1) it
   attains near-minimax mean-squared error for moderate sample sizes, and
   (2) the computational complexity is lower for sparser densities. Our
   method also allows for flexible control of the trade-off between
   mean-squared error and computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{New labeling, imaging, or analysis tools could provide new retrospective
   insights when applied to archived, paraffin-embedded samples.
   Deep-tissue multiphoton microscopy of paraffin-embedded specimens is
   achieved using optical clearing with mineral oil. We tested a variety of
   murine tissue specimens including skin, lung, spleen, kidney, and heart,
   acquiring multiphoton autofluorescence and second-harmonic generation,
   and pump-probe images This technique introduces the capability for
   non-destructive 3-dimensional microscopic imaging of existing archived

Abstract = {{We develop a mixture procedure to monitor parallel streams of data for a
   change-point that affects only a subset of them, without assuming a
   spatial structure relating the data streams to one another. Observations
   are assumed initially to be independent standard normal random
   variables. After a change-point the observations in a subset of the
   streams of data have non-zero mean values. The subset and the
   post-change means are unknown. The procedure we study uses stream
   specific generalized likelihood ratio statistics, which are combined to
   form an overall detection statistic in a mixture model that hypothesizes
   an assumed fraction p(0) of affected data streams. An analytic
   expression is obtained for the average run length (ARL) when there is no
   change and is shown by simulations to be very accurate. Similarly, an
   approximation for the expected detection delay (EDD) after a
   change-point is also obtained. Numerical examples are given to compare
   the suggested procedure to other procedures for unstructured problems
   and in one case where the problem is assumed to have a well defined
   geometric structure. Finally we discuss sensitivity of the procedure to
   the assumed value of p(0) and suggest a generalization.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanomaterials have been proposed as a basis for developing new
   technologies for photocatalytic oxidation and disinfection, improved
   membrane processes, adsorbents, and biofilm-resistant surfaces. This
   study details recent progress towards the development of these proposed
   applications. We explored the use of carbon nanomaterials such as
   fullerene C-60, single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and multi-wall
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for a range of new technologies including,
   degradation of a probe organic compound by in situ generation of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS), new strategies for microbial
   disinfection, and the inhibition of biofilm development on membrane
   surfaces. The results show that the degradation of 2-chlorophenol by ROS
   produced microbial inactivation, and the mobility of the nanoparticle
   aggregates of the carbon nanomaterials all increased as suspensions were
   fractionated to enrich with smaller aggregates with sonication followed
   by successive membrane filtration.}},

Abstract = {{Adult articular cartilage exhibits little capacity for intrinsic repair,
   and thus even minor injuries or lesions may lead to progressive damage
   and osteoarthritic joint degeneration, resulting in significant pain and
   disability. While there have been numerous attempts to develop
   tissue-engineered grafts or patches to repair focal chondral and
   osteochondral defects, there remain significant challenges in the
   clinical application of cell-based therapies for cartilage repair. This
   paper reviews the current state of cartilage tissue engineering with
   respect to different cell sources and their potential genetic
   modification, biomaterial scaffolds and growth factors, as well as
   preclinical testing in various animal models. This is not intended as a
   systematic review, rather an opinion of where the field is moving in
   light of current literature. While significant advances have been made
   in recent years, the complexity of this problem suggests that a
   multidisciplinary approach - combining a clinical perspective with
   expertise in cell biology, biomechanics, biomaterials science and
   high-throughput analysis will likely be necessary to address the
   challenge of developing functional cartilage replacements. With this
   approach we are more likely to realise the clinical goal of treating
   both focal defects and even large-scale osteoarthritic degenerative
   changes in the joint.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a suite of protein redesign algorithms that improves
   realistic in silico modeling of proteins. These algorithms are based on
   three characteristics that make them unique: (1) improved flexibility of
   the protein backbone, protein side-chains, and ligand to accurately
   capture the conformational changes that are induced by mutations to the
   protein sequence; (2) modeling of proteins and ligands as ensembles of
   low-energy structures to better approximate binding affinity; and (3) a
   globally optimal protein design search, guaranteeing that the
   computational predictions are optimal with respect to the input model.
   Here, we illustrate the importance of these three characteristics. We
   then describe OSPREY, a protein redesign suite that implements our
   protein design algorithms. OSPREY has been used prospectively, with
   experimental validation, in several biomedically relevant settings. We
   show in detail how OSPREY has been used to predict resistance mutations
   and explain why improved flexibility, ensembles, and provability are
   essential for this application.}},

   constituencies. Additionally, the model estimates the number of latent

Title = {{Three-dimensional photolithographic micropatterning: a novel tool to
   probe the complexities of cell migration}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{817-827}},
Abstract = {{In order to independently study the numerous variables that influence
   cell movement, it will be necessary to employ novel tools and materials
   that allow for exquisite control of the cellular microenvironment. In
   this work, we have applied advanced 3D micropatterning technology, known
   as two-photon laser scanning lithography (TP-LSL), to poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG) hydrogels modified with bioactive peptides in order to
   fabricate precisely designed microenvironments to guide and
   quantitatively investigate cell migration. Specifically, TP-LSL was used
   to fabricate cell adhesive PEG-RGDS micropatterns on the surface of
   non-degradable PEG-based hydrogels (2D) and in the interior of
   proteolytically degradable PEG-based hydrogels (3D). HT1080 cell
   migration was guided down these adhesive micropatterns in both 2D and
   3D, as observed via time-lapse microscopy. Differences in cell speed,
   cell persistence, and cell shape were observed based on variation of
   adhesive ligand, hydrogel composition, and patterned area for both 2D
   and 3D migration. Results indicated that HT1080s migrate faster and with
   lower persistence on 2D surfaces, while HT1080s migrating in 3D were
   smaller and more elongated. Further, cell migration was shown to have a
   biphasic dependence on PEG-RGDS concentration and cells moving within
   PEG-RGDS micropatterns were seen to move faster and with more
   persistence over time. Importantly, the work presented here begins to
   elucidate the multiple complex factors involved in cell migration, with
   typical confounding factors being independently controlled. The

Title = {{Self-Propagating Reactive Fronts in Compacts of Multilayered Particles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Reactive multilayered foils in the form of thin films have gained
   interest in various applications such as joining, welding, and ignition.
   Typically, thin film multilayers support self-propagating reaction
   fronts with speeds ranging from 1 to 20m/s. In some applications,
   however, reaction fronts with much smaller velocities are required. This
   recently motivated Fritz et al. (2011) to fabricate compacts of regular
   sized/shaped multilayered particles and demonstrate self-sustained
   reaction fronts having much smaller velocities than thin films with
   similar layering. In this work, we develop a simplified numerical model
   to simulate the self-propagation of reactive fronts in an idealized
   compact, comprising identical Ni/Al multilayered particles in thermal
   contact. The evolution of the reaction in the compact is simulated using
   a two-dimensional transient model, based on a reduced description of
   mixing, heat release, and thermal transport. Computed results reveal
   that an advancing reaction front can be substantially delayed as it
   crosses from one particle to a neighboring particle, which results in a
   reduced mean propagation velocity. A quantitative analysis is thus
   conducted on the dependence of these phenomena on the contact area
   between the particles, the thermal contact resistance, and the
   arrangement of the multilayered particles.}},

Abstract = {{The development of DNA detection techniques on large-area
   plasmonics-active platforms is critical for many medical applications
   such as high-throughput screening, medical diagnosis and systems biology
   research. Here, we report for the first time a unique ``molecular
   sentinel-on-chip'' (MSC) technology for surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS)-based DNA detection. This unique approach allows
   label-free detection of DNA molecules on chips developed on a wafer
   scale using large area nanofabrication methodologies. To develop
   plasmonics-active biosensing platforms in a repeatable and reproducible
   manner, we employed a combination of deep UV lithography, atomic layer
   deposition, and metal deposition to fabricate triangular-shaped nanowire
   (TSNW) arrays having controlled sub-10 nm gap nanostructures over an
   entire 6 inch wafer. The detection of a DNA sequence of the Ki-67 gene,
   a critical breast cancer biomarker, on the TSNW substrate illustrates
   the usefulness and potential of the MSC technology as a novel SERS-based
   DNA detection method.}},

Title = {{Electric field depth-focality tradeoff in transcranial magnetic
   stimulation: Simulation comparison of 50 coil designs}},
Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Various transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil designs
   are available or have been proposed. However, key coil characteristics
   such as electric field focality and attenuation in depth have not been
   adequately compared. Knowledge of the coil focality and depth
   characteristics can help TMS researchers and clinicians with coil
   selection and interpretation of TMS studies.
   Objective: To quantify the electric field focality and depth of
   penetration of various TMS coils.
   Methods: The electric field distributions induced by 50 TMS coils were
   simulated in a spherical human head model using the finite element
   method. For each coil design, we quantified the electric field
   penetration by the half-value depth, d(1/2), and focality by the
   tangential spread, S-1/2, defined as the half-value volume (V-1/2)
   divided by the half-value depth, S-1/2 = V-1/2/d(1/2).
   Results: The 50 TMS coils exhibit a wide range of electric field
   focality and depth, but all followed a depth focality tradeoff: coils
   with larger half-value depth cannot be as focal as more superficial
   coils. The ranges of achievable d(1/2) are similar between coils
   producing circular and figure-8 electric field patterns, ranging 1.0-3.5
   cm and 0.9-3.4 cm, respectively. However, figure-8 field coils are more
   focal, having S-1/2 as low as 5 cm(2) compared to 34 cm(2) for circular
   field coils.
   Conclusions: For any coil design, the ability to directly stimulate
   deeper brain structures is obtained at the expense of inducing wider
   electrical field spread. Novel coil designs should be benchmarked
   against comparison coils with consistent metrics such as d(1/2) and
   S-1/2. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the design and operation of a unique hydraulic press for the
   study of scintillator materials under isostatic pressure. This press,
   capable of developing a pressure of a gigapascal, consists of a large
   sample chamber pressurized by a two-stage hydraulic amplifier. The
   optical detection of the scintillation light emitted by the sample is
   performed, through a large aperture optical port, by a photodetector
   located outside the pressure vessel. In addition to providing essential
   pressure-dependent studies on the emission characteristics of
   radioluminescent materials, this apparatus is being developed to
   elucidate the mechanisms behind the recently observed dependency of
   light-yield nonproportionality on electronic band structure. The
   variation of the light output of a Tl:CsI crystal under 511-keV gamma
   excitation and hydrostatic pressure is given as an example. (C) 2013

   targeting is achieved by functionalization of carriers to allow specific
   interactions between the carrier and the tumor environment.
   Functionalization of carriers with ligands that specifically interact
   with overexpressed receptors on cancer cells represents a classic
   approach to active tumor targeting. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs)
   provide a non-specific and receptor-independent mechanism to enhance
   cellular uptake that offers an exciting alternative to traditional
   active targeting approaches. While the non-specificity of CPP-mediated
   internalization has the intriguing potential to make this approach
   applicable to a wide range of tumor types, their promiscuity is,
   however, a significant barrier to their clinical utility for
   systemically administered applications. Many approaches have been
   investigated to selectively turn on the function of systemically
   delivered CPP-functionalized carriers specifically in tumors to achieve
   targeted delivery of cancer therapeutics and imaging agents. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Droplet-based digital microfluidics technology has now come of age, and
   software-controlled biochips for healthcare applications are starting to
   emerge. However, today's digital microfluidic biochips suffer from the
   drawback that there is no feedback to the control software from the
   underlying hardware platform. Due to the lack of precision inherent in
   biochemical experiments, errors are likely during droplet manipulation;
   error recovery based on the repetition of experiments leads to wastage
   of expensive reagents and hard-to-prepare samples. By exploiting recent
   advances in the integration of optical detectors (sensors) into a
   digital microfluidics biochip, we present a physical-aware system
   reconfiguration technique that uses sensor data at intermediate
   checkpoints to dynamically reconfigure the biochip. A cyberphysical
   resynthesis technique is used to recompute electrode-actuation
   sequences, thereby deriving new schedules, module placement, and droplet
   routing pathways, with minimum impact on the time-to-response.}},

Abstract = {{Output selection is a recently proposed test response compaction method,
   where only a subset of output response bits is selected for observation.
   It can achieve zero aliasing, full X-tolerance, and high diagnosability.
   One critical issue for output selection is how to implement the
   selection hardware. In this paper, we present a counter-based output
   selection scheme that employs only a counter and a multiplexer, hence
   involving very small area overhead and simple test control. The proposed
   scheme is ATPG-independent and thus can easily be incorporated into a
   typical design flow. Two efficient output selection algorithms are
   presented to determine the desired output responses, one using a single
   counter operation for simpler test control and the other using more
   counter operations for achieving a better test-response reduction ratio.
   Experimental results show that for stuck-at faults in large ISCAS'89 and
   ITC'99 benchmark circuits, 48\%similar to 90\% reduction ratios on test
   responses can be achieved with only one counter and one multiplexer
   employed. Even better results, i.e., 76\%similar to 95\% reductions, can
   be obtained for transition faults. It is also shown that the diagnostic
   resolution of this method is almost the same as that achieved by
   observing all output responses.}},

Title = {{Effects of Ligand Binding on the Mechanical Properties of Ankyrin Repeat
   Protein Gankyrin}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ankyrin repeat proteins are elastic materials that unfold and refold
   sequentially, repeat by repeat, under force. Herein we use atomistic
   molecular dynamics to compare the mechanical properties of the
   7-ankyrin-repeat oncoprotein Gankyrin in isolation and in complex with
   its binding partner S6-C. We show that the bound S6-C greatly increases
   the resistance of Gankyrin to mechanical stress. The effect is specific
   to those repeats of Gankyrin directly in contact with S6-C, and the
   mechanical `hot spots' of the interaction map to the same repeats as the
   thermodynamic hot spots. A consequence of stepwise nature of unfolding
   and the localized nature of ligand binding is that it impacts on all
   aspects of the protein's mechanical behavior, including the order of
   repeat unfolding, the diversity of unfolding pathways accessed, the
   nature of partially unfolded intermediates, the forces required and the
   work transferred to the system to unfold the whole protein and its
   parts. Stepwise unfolding thus provides the means to buffer repeat
   proteins and their binding partners from mechanical stress in the cell.
   Our results illustrate how ligand binding can control the mechanical
   response of proteins. The data also point to a cellular
   mechano-switching mechanism whereby binding between two partner
   macromolecules is regulated by mechanical stress.}},

   system}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{292-304}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An effective description of water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
   continuum (SPAC) is needed for wide-ranging applications in hydrology
   and climate-vegetation interactions. In this contribution, the theory of
   water movement within the SPAC is reviewed with emphasis on the
   eco-physiological and evolutionary constraints to water transport. The
   description of the SPAC can be framed at two widely separated time
   scales: (i) sub-hourly to growing season scales, relevant for
   hydro-climatic effects on ecosystem fluxes (given a set of plant
   hydraulic traits), and (ii) inter-annual to centennial scales during
   which either hydraulic traits may change, as individuals grow and
   acclimate, or species composition may change. At the shorter time
   scales, water transport can be described by water balance equations
   where fluxes depend on the hydraulic features of the different
   compartments, encoded in the form of conductances that nonlinearly
   depend on water availability. Over longer time scales, ontogeny,
   acclimation, and shifts in species composition in response to
   environmental changes can impose constraints on these equations in the
   form of tradeoffs and coordinated changes in the hydraulic (and
   biochemical) parameters. Quantification of this evolutionary
   coordination and the related tradeoffs offers novel theoretical tactics
   to constrain hydrologic and biogeochemical models. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We report the first demonstration of surface-initiated enzymatic
   polymerization (SIEP) for the direct detection of RNA in a fluorescence
   microarray format. This new method incorporates multiple fluorophores
   into an RNA strand using the two-step sequential and complementary
   reactions catalyzed by yeast poly(A) polymerase (PaP) to incorporate
   deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) at the 3'-OH of an RNA molecule,
   followed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) to catalyze the
   sequential addition of a mixture of natural and fluorescent
   deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) at the 3'-OH of an RNA-DNA hybrid. We found
   that the 3'-end of RNA can be efficiently converted into DNA (similar to
   50\% conversion) by polymerization of dATP using yeast PaP, and the
   short DNA strand appended to the end of the RNA by PaP acts as the
   initiator for the TdT-catalyzed polymerization of longer DNA strands
   from a mixture of natural and fluorescent dNTPs that contain up to
   similar to 45 Cy3 fluorophores per 1 kb DNA. We obtained an similar to 2
   pM limit of detection (LOD) and a 3 log-linear dynamic range for
   hybridization of a short 21 base-long RNA target to an immobilized
   peptide nucleic acid probe, while fragmented mRNA targets from three
   different full length mRNA transcripts yielded a similar to 10 pM LOD
   with a similar dynamic range in a microarray format.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and precise displacement estimation has been a hallmark of
   clinical ultrasound. Displacement estimation accuracy has largely been
   considered to be limited by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). However,
   the CRLB only describes the minimum variance obtainable from unbiased
   estimators. Unbiased estimators are generally implemented using Bayes'
   theorem, which requires a likelihood function. The classic likelihood
   function for the displacement estimation problem is not discriminative
   and is difficult to implement for clinically relevant ultrasound with
   diffuse scattering. Because the classic likelihood function is not
   effective, a perturbation is proposed.
   The proposed likelihood function was evaluated and compared against the
   classic likelihood function by converting both to posterior probability
   density functions (PDFs) using a non-informative prior. Example results
   are reported for bulk motion simulations using a 6 lambda tracking
   kernel and 30 dB SNR for 1000 data realizations. The canonical
   likelihood function assigned the true displacement a mean probability of
   only 0.070 +/- 0.020, whereas the new likelihood function assigned the
   true displacement a much higher probability of 0.22 +/- 0.16. The new
   likelihood function shows improvements at least for bulk motion,
   acoustic radiation force induced motion, and compressive motion, and at
   least for SNRs greater than 10 dB and kernel lengths between 1.5 and 12
   lambda.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic displacement estimates have numerous clinical uses, including
   blood flow estimation, elastography, therapeutic guidance, and acoustic
   radiation force imaging (ARFI). These clinical tasks could be improved
   with better ultrasonic displacement estimates. Traditional ultrasonic
   displacement estimates are limited by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).
   The CRLB can be surpassed using biased estimates. In this paper, a
   framework for biased estimation using Bayes' theorem is described.
   The Bayesian displacement estimation method is tested against
   simulations of several common types of motion: bulk, step, compression,
   and acoustic-radiation-force-induced motion. Bayesian estimation is also
   applied to in vivo ARFI of cardiac ablation lesions. The Bayesian
   estimators are compared with the unbiased estimator, normalized
   cross-correlation.
   As an example, the peak displacement of the simulated acoustic radiation
   force response is reported because this position results in the noisiest
   estimates. Estimates were made with a 1.5-lambda kernel and 20 dB SNR on
   100 data realizations. Estimates using normalized cross-correlation and
   the Bayes' estimator had mean-square errors of 17 and 7.6 mu m(2),
   respectively, and contextualized by the true displacement magnitude,
   10.9 mu m. Biases for normalized cross-correlation and the Bayes'
   estimator are -0.12 and -0.28 mu m, respectively. In vivo results show
   qualitative improvements. The results show that with small amounts of
   additional information, significantly improved performance can be
   realized.}},

Pages = {{1-17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of aerodynamic asymmetries on the flutter
   characteristics of turbomachinery blades is investigated. Specifically,
   the present method is used to study the effect of leading edge blending
   in loaded and unloaded rotors. The unsteady aerodynamic response of the
   blades to self-excited vibrations is modeled using a harmonic balance
   method, which allows one to model the entire wheel using complex
   periodic boundary conditions and a computational grid spanning a single
   sector (symmetry group). This reduces the computational and memory
   requirements dramatically compared to similar time-accurate analyses. It
   is shown that alternate blending degrades the stability of a loaded
   rotor whereas it improves the stability of an unloaded rotor. On the
   other hand, when blends are spaced five blades apart their effect is
   less pronounced. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Materials characterization of the low temperature sensitive liposome
   (LTSL): effects of the lipid composition (lysolipid and DSPE-PEG2000) on
   the thermal transition and release of doxorubicin}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{515-534}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes how we have used material science, physical
   chemistry, and some luck, to design a new thermal-sensitive liposome
   (the low temperature sensitive liposome (LTSL)) that responds at
   clinically attainable hyperthermic temperatures releasing its drug in a
   matter of seconds as it passes through the microvasculature of a warmed
   tumor. The LTSL is composed of a judicial combination of three component
   lipids, each with a specific function and each affecting specific
   material properties, including a sharp thermal transition and a rapid
   on-set of membrane permeability to small ions, drugs and small dextran
   polymers. Experimentally, the paper describes how bilayer-concentration
   changes involving the lysolipid and the presence or absence of
   DSPE-PEG2000 affect both the lipid transition temperature and the drug
   release. While the inclusion of 4 mol\% DSPE-PEG2000 raises the
   transition temperature peak (T-m) by about 1 degrees C, the inclusion of
   5.0, 9.7, 12.7 and 18.0 mol\% MSPC slightly lowered this peak back to
   41.7 degrees C, while not further broadening the peak breadth. As for
   drug release, in the absence of MSPC, the encapsulated
   doxorubicin-citrate is hardly released at all. Increasing the
   composition of MSPC in the lipid mixture (5.0, 7.4, 8.5 and 9.3 mol\%
   MSPC) shows faster and faster initial doxorubicin release rates, with
   8.5 and 9.3 mol\% MSPC formulations giving 80\% of encapsulated drug
   released in 4 and 3 min, respectively. The Thermodox (R) formulation
   (9.7 mol\% MSPC) gives 60\% released in the first 20 s. The presence of
   PEG-lipid is found to be essential in order for the lysolipid-induced
   permeability to reach these very fast times. From drug and dextran
   release experiments, and estimates of the molecular and pore size, the
   conclusions are that: in order to induce lasting nanopores in lipid
   bilayers similar to 10 nm diameter, they initially require the presence
   (from the solid phase structure) of grain boundary defects at the DPPC
   transition and the permeabilizing component(s) can either be a pore
   forming lysolipid/surfactant plus a PEG-lipid, or can be generated by a
   PEG-surfactant incorporated at similar to 4-5 mol\%. The final
   discussion is centered around the postulated defect structures that
   result in membrane leakage and the permeability of doxorubicin and H+
   ions.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency deep brain stimulation is an effective therapy for motor
   symptoms in Parkinson's disease. However, the relative clinical efficacy
   of regular versus non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation in
   Parkinson's disease remains unclear. To determine the temporal
   characteristics of non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation
   important for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, we compared the
   efficacy of temporally regular stimulation with four non-regular
   patterns of stimulation in subjects with Parkinson's disease using an
   alternating finger tapping task. The patterns of stimulation were also
   evaluated in a biophysical model of the parkinsonian basal ganglia that
   exhibited prominent oscillatory activity in the beta frequency range.
   The temporal patterns of stimulation differentially improved motor task
   performance. Three of the non-regular patterns of stimulation improved
   performance of the finger tapping task more than temporally regular
   stimulation. In the computational model all patterns of deep brain
   stimulation suppressed beta band oscillatory activity, and the degree of
   suppression was strongly correlated with the clinical efficacy across
   stimulation patterns. The three non-regular patterns of stimulation that
   improved motor performance over regular stimulation also suppressed beta
   band oscillatory activity in the computational model more effectively
   than regular stimulation. These data demonstrate that the temporal
   pattern of stimulation is an important consideration for the clinical
   efficacy of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore,
   non-regular patterns of stimulation may ameliorate motor symptoms and
   suppress pathological rhythmic activity in the basal ganglia more
   effectively than regular stimulation. Therefore, non-regular patterns of
   deep brain stimulation may have useful clinical and experimental
   applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Being prevalent extracellular matrix components, collagen and
   glycosaminoglycan (GAG) are co-precipitated as scaffolds for tissue
   regeneration. However, the amount of GAG incorporated and its long-term
   retention present a persistent problem. In this study, chemical
   modifications, namely deamination, methylation and amination, were used
   to alter the net charge of collagen prior to fabrication of collagen-GAG
   co-precipitate. While most GAGs were lost in the untreated group and the
   deaminated group within 1 day, methylation and amination of collagen
   retained over 20\% and 40\% GAG after 6 days, respectively. Moreover,
   over 60\% of GAG retention was achieved in the aminated group after cell
   seeding for 8 days. Furthermore, amination of collagen increased the
   GAG/hydroxyproline ratio in the co-precipitate to >4.5, approaching that
   of native nucleus pulposus. Ultrastructural analysis showed that the
   aminated group contains abundant granular substances resembling the
   extracellular matrix of native nucleus pulposus. Despite lower initial
   cell adhesion than untreated, all modified scaffolds promoted
   proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and showed >95\%
   cell viability at all time points. Cell morphology was distinct among
   the different groups, being round in the untreated control and
   methylated groups but elongated in deaminated and aminated groups. hMSCs
   adhered to scaffolds via collagen receptor integrin alpha 2 beta 1 in
   all groups, while all but the aminated group showed extensive expression
   of the general matrix receptor integrin alpha v. This work reports an
   effective method, namely amination of collagen, to improve GAG
   incorporation and retention in collagen-GAG co-precipitates,
   facilitating the fabrication of GAG-rich collagenous scaffold for
   intervertebral disc tissue engineering. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Conjugation of catabolic plasmids in contaminated environments is a
   naturally occurring horizontal gene transfer phenomenon, which could be
   utilized in genetic bioaugmentation. The potentially important
   parameters for genetic bioaugmentation include gene regulation of
   transferred catabolic plasmids that may be controlled by the genetic
   characteristics of transconjugants as well as environmental conditions
   that may alter the expression of the contaminant-degrading phenotype.
   This study showed that both genomic guanine-cytosine contents and
   phylogenetic characteristics of transconjugants were important in
   controlling the phenotype functionality of the TOL plasmid. These
   genetic characteristics had no apparent impact on the stability of the
   TOL plasmid, which was observed to be highly variable among strains.
   Within the environmental conditions tested, the addition of glucose
   resulted in the largest enhancement of the activities of enzymes encoded
   by the TOL plasmid in all transconjugant strains. Glucose (1 g/L)
   enhanced the phenotype functionality by up to 16.4 (+/- 2.22), 30.8 (+/-
   7.03), and 90.8 (+/- 4.56)-fold in toluene degradation rates, catechol
   2,3-dioxygenase enzymatic activities, and xylE gene expression,
   respectively. These results suggest that genetic limitations of the
   expression of horizontally acquired genes may be overcome by the
   presence of alternate carbon substrates. Such observations may be
   utilized in improving the effectiveness of genetic bioaugmentation.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently developed a microscope-integrated spectral-domain
   optical coherence tomography (MIOCT) device towards intrasurgical
   cross-sectional imaging of surgical maneuvers. In this report, we
   explore the capability of MIOCT to acquire real-time video imaging of
   vitreoretinal surgical maneuvers without post-processing modifications.
   Standard 3-port vitrectomy was performed in human during scheduled
   surgery as well as in cadaveric porcine eyes. MIOCT imaging of human
   subjects was performed in healthy normal volunteers and intraoperatively
   at a normal pause immediately following surgical manipulations, under an
   Institutional Review Board-approved protocol, with informed consent from
   all subjects. Video MIOCT imaging of live surgical manipulations was
   performed in cadaveric porcine eyes by carefully aligning B-scans with
   instrument orientation and movement. Inverted imaging was performed by
   lengthening of the reference arm to a position beyond the choroid.
   Unprocessed MIOCT imaging was successfully obtained in healthy human
   volunteers and in human patients undergoing surgery, with visualization
   of post-surgical changes in unprocessed single B-scans. Real-time,
   unprocessed MIOCT video imaging was successfully obtained in cadaveric
   porcine eyes during brushing of the retina with the Tano scraper,
   peeling of superficial retinal tissue with intraocular forceps, and
   separation of the posterior hyaloid face. Real-time inverted imaging
   enabled imaging without complex conjugate artifacts.
   MIOCT is capable of unprocessed imaging of the macula in human patients
   undergoing surgery and of unprocessed, real-time, video imaging of
   surgical maneuvers in model eyes. These capabilities represent an
   important step towards development of MIOCT for efficient, real-time
   imaging of manipulations during human surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave induced thermo-acoustic tomography (MITAT) has become a keen
   research topic in recent years due to its great potential in early
   breast cancer detection. A secure and accurate MITAT system has been

   some quantitative features of the system have been obtained. Some
   imaging experiments with real human breast cancer tissues are performed
   to demonstrate its effectiveness and the potential in clinical
   diagnosis. Images with both high contrast and fine spatial resolution
   are achieved by using time reversal mirror (TRM) technique in the
   imaging processing. Moreover, comparisons between the MITAT system
   result and an ultrasound imaging system result are made. From the
   comparison, the MITAT system shows its advantages of better contrast
   over the ultrasound imaging system. The system and the experiments in
   this paper verify the mechanism of MITAT for breast cancer detection and

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{253}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the formulation and implementation of an Error in
   Constitutive Equations (ECE) method suitable for large-scale inverse
   identification of linear elastic material properties in the context of
   steady-state elastodynamics. In ECE-based methods, the inverse problem
   is postulated as an optimization problem in which the cost functional
   measures the discrepancy in the constitutive equations that connect
   kinematically admissible strains and dynamically admissible stresses.
   Furthermore, in a more recent modality of this methodology introduced by
   Feissel and Allix {[}17], referred to as the Modified ECE (MECE), the
   measured data is incorporated into the formulation as a quadratic
   penalty term. We show that a simple and efficient continuation scheme
   for the penalty term, suggested by the theory of quadratic penalty
   methods, can significantly accelerate the convergence of the MECE
   algorithm. Furthermore, a (block) successive over-relaxation (SOR)
   technique is introduced, enabling the use of existing parallel finite
   element codes with minimal modification to solve the coupled system of
   equations that arises from the optimality conditions in MECE methods.
   Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can
   successfully reconstruct the spatial distribution of elastic material
   parameters from partial and noisy measurements in as few as ten
   iterations in a 20 example and fifty in a 3D example. We show (through
   numerical experiments) that the proposed continuation scheme can improve
   the rate of convergence of MECE methods by at least an order of
   magnitude versus the alternative of using a fixed penalty parameter.
   Furthermore, the proposed block SOR strategy coupled with existing
   parallel solvers produces a computationally efficient MECE method that
   can be used for large scale materials identification problems, as
   demonstrated on a 3D example involving about 400,000 unknown moduli.
   Finally, our numerical results suggest that the proposed MECE approach
   can be significantly faster than the conventional approach of L-2
   minimization using quasi-Newton methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We demonstrated that the reactivity, electrochemically active area
   (ECSA), and long-term structural stability of Pt-based core-shell
   nanoparticles (NPs) under the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) can be
   controlled by the crystal structure and the chemical composition of the
   core. This approach is inspired by the structural relaxation of shell Pt
   atoms on two types of crystalline cores (e.g., Ru and Co) due to the
   differences in surface free energy between facets. Due to the isotropic
   facet energy of the Co cores, the initial formation of the Pt shell is
   under kinetic control when the shell thickness is less than two atomic
   layers (similar to 3 A). After the surface layer is formed, the
   subsequent growth of the Pt shell atoms is under surface diffusion
   control. For Ru core crystallites with significantly different facet
   energies, the NPs are disk-like shaped, indicating that the shell atoms
   preferentially deposit onto the radial edges in the absence of
   nucleation barriers. In this case, the ECSA of the Ru-core-Pt-shell NPs
   is 2.23-fold higher than that of the Co-core-Pt-shell NPs, which is

Title = {{Simplified Analysis of Chlorinated Ethenes in Water Samples by Gas

Abstract = {{Chlorinated ethenes are among the most common environmental contaminants
   and are known or suspected carcinogens. This class of compounds includes
   perchloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), and their breakdown
   products, including dichloroethene (DCE) isomers and vinyl chloride
   (VC). Engineers and scientists must be able to measure concentrations of
   these chemicals in water samples to assess site contamination, monitor
   clean-up progress, and test possible remediation technologies. Gas
   chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID) is a common
   method for measuring these contaminants in environmental samples. In
   this study, we tested the hypothesis that FID response factors are equal
   for all chlorinated ethene compounds. The rationale for the
   investigation was that if the hypothesis is correct, a single
   calibration curve can be used for GC/FID analysis of all chlorinated
   ethene compounds, saving time and money during sample analysis. Based on
   our measurements, a single calibration curve (FID response versus mass
   of analyte injected) is applicable to analysis of PCE, TCE, and all
   three DCE isomers (r(2) = 0.990, n = 50 measurements), allowing for
   simplified quantification of those chemicals. However, the apparent FID
   response factor for VC was lower by similar to 40\%, indicating that a
   separate calibration curve would need to be used to accurately estimate
   the VC concentration in water samples. The difference in the apparent VC
   response factor is caused predominantly by losses of VC to
   volatilization during the analysis.}},

Title = {{A Broadband Unidirectional Antenna Based on Closely Spaced Loading
   Method}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{109-116}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In order to achieve broadband and unidirectional radiation, a planar
   printed antenna based on closely spaced loading method is proposed and
   fabricated. This antenna consists of a printed rectangular loop with two
   gaps and a metallic strip. The rectangular loop has a good direction but
   has a drawback of narrow band. According to the closely spaced loading
   theory, the impedance at the upper frequency will decrease when a
   metallic strip is placed at the maximum radiation direction of the
   rectangular loop. This improves the impedance matching. A new resonant
   frequency point is induced. Meanwhile, the resonant frequency point can
   be changed by modifying the length of the metallic strip. The impedance
   matching between the two resonant peaks (One peak is determined by the
   rectangular loop, the other is determined by the metallic strip) is
   improved by changing the length and the position of the metallic strip.
   Thus the impedance bandwidth is greatly expanded. Experimental results
   show good performance of the proposed antenna. It has a 40.7\% measured
   bandwidth, ranging from 2.29 to 3.46 GHz. The measured front-to-back
   (F/B) ratio of the proposed antenna is larger than 10 dB in the whole
   frequency band.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most coordinated tasks performed by teams of mobile robots require
   reliable communications between team members. Therefore, task
   accomplishment requires that robots navigate their environment with
   their collective movement restricted to formations that guarantee
   integrity of the communication network. Maintaining this communication
   capability induces physical constraints on trajectories but also
   requires determination of communication variables like routes and
   transmitted powers. This problem is addressed here using a distributed
   hybrid approach. Continuous distributed motion controllers based on
   potential fields interact with discrete distributed optimization of
   communication variables to result in a muti-robot network ensuring
   communication integrity. The definition of network integrity differs
   from existing approaches in that it is not based only on the topology of
   the network but also on metrics that are of interest to the performance
   of communication between robots and a fixed infrastructure.
   Specifically, integrity is defined as the ability of the network to
   support desired communication rates. The ability of the hybrid
   controller to guarantee communication integrity while robots move to
   accomplish their task is studied theoretically and numerically.}},

Abstract = {{Here we document comparatively the performance of three flow
   architectures for heat transfer between a buried flow structure and a
   conducting medium: trees with Y-shaped bifurcations, trees with T-shaped
   bifurcations, and classical U-shaped and serpentine designs. The
   competing designs occupy the same volume fraction. The tree
   architectures have up to four levels of bifurcation (N). We found that
   the heat transfer performance depends greatly on the flow configuration.
   The tree shaped designs yield improvements in heat transfer density as N
   increases from 0 to 4. The Y-shaped design is the best of the three
   architectures. The scale analysis of tree-in-solid heat transfer
   anticipates correctly the key features of the thermal performance of the
   architecture. The paper also shows that the tree architecture, which is
   derived from minimizing flow resistance, also has the property that it
   distributes uniformly the flow resistance time throughout the structure.
   This is true for both laminar and turbulent flow. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This work concerns the development of field directionality mapping
   algorithms for short acoustic arrays on mobile maneuverable platforms
   that avoid the left/right ambiguities and endfire resolution degradation
   common to longer non-maneuverable line arrays. In this paper, it is
   shown that short maneuverable arrays can achieve a high fraction of
   usable bearing space for target detection in interference-dominated
   scenarios, despite their lower array gain against diffuse background
   noise. Two narrowband techniques are presented which use the
   expectation-maximization maximum likelihood algorithm under different
   models of the time-varying field directionality. The first, derivative
   based maximum likelihood, uses a deterministic model while the second,
   recursive Bayes maximum likelihood, uses a stochastic model for the
   time-varying spatial spectrum. In addition, a broadband extension is
   introduced that incorporates temporal spectral knowledge to suppress
   ambiguities when the average sensor array spacing is greater than a
   half-wavelength. Dynamic multi-source simulations demonstrate the
   ability of a short, maneuvering array to reduce array ambiguities and
   spatial grating lobes in an interference dominated environment. Monte
   Carlo evaluation of receiver operating characteristics is used to
   evaluate the improvement in source detection achieved by the proposed
   methods versus conventional broadband beamforming. (C) 2013 Acoustical

Title = {{Reduction of peak acoustic pressure and shaping of heated region by use
   of multifoci sonications in MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound
   mediated mild hyperthermia}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Ablative hyperthermia (>55 degrees C) has been used as a
   definitive treatment for accessible solid tumors not amenable to
   surgery, whereas mild hyperthermia (40-45 degrees C) has been shown
   effective as an adjuvant for both radiotherapy and chemotherapy. An
   optimal mild hyperthermia treatment is spatially accurate, with precise
   and homogeneous heating limited to the target region while also limiting
   the likelihood of unwanted thermal or mechanical bioeffects (tissue
   damage, vascular shutoff). Magnetic resonance imaging-guided
   high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) can noninvasively heat solid
   tumors under image-guidance. In a mild hyperthermia setting, a
   sonication approach utilizing multiple concurrent foci may provide the
   benefit of reducing acoustic pressure in the focal region (leading to
   reduced or no mechanical effects), while providing better control over
   the heating. The objective of this study was to design, implement, and
   characterize a multifoci sonication approach in combination with a mild
   hyperthermia heating algorithm, and compare it to the more conventional
   method of electronically sweeping a single focus.
   Methods: Simulations (acoustic and thermal) and measurements (acoustic,
   with needle hydrophone) were performed. In addition, heating performance
   of multifoci and single focus sonications was compared using a clinical
   MR-HIFU platform in a phantom (target = 4-16 mm), in normal rabbit thigh
   muscle (target = 8 mm), and in a Vx2 tumor (target = 8 mm). A binary
   control algorithm was used for real-time mild hyperthermia feedback
   control (target range = 40.5-41 degrees C). Data were analyzed for peak
   acoustic pressure and intensity, heating energy efficiency, temperature
   accuracy (mean), homogeneity of heating (standard deviation {[}SD], T10
   and T90), diameter and length of the heated region, and thermal dose
   (CEM43).
   Results: Compared to the single focus approach, multifoci sonications
   showed significantly lower (67\% reduction) peak acoustic pressures in
   simulations and hydrophone measurements. In a rabbit Vx2 tumor, both
   single focus and multifoci heating approaches were accurate (mean =
   40.82 +/- 0.12 degrees C {[}single] and 40.70 +/- 0.09 degrees C
   {[}multi]) and precise (standard deviation = 0.65 +/- 0.05 degrees C
   {[}single] and 0.64 +/- 0.04 degrees C {[}multi]), producing homogeneous
   heating (T10-90 = 1.62 degrees C {[}single] and 1.41 degrees C
   {[}multi]). Heated regions were significantly shorter in the beam path
   direction (35\% reduction, p < 0.05, Tukey) for multifoci sonications,
   i.e., resulting in an aspect ratio closer to one. Energy efficiency was
   lower for the multifoci approach. Similar results were achieved in
   phantom and rabbit muscle heating experiments.
   Conclusions: A multifoci sonication approach was combined with a mild
   hyperthermia heating algorithm, and implemented on a clinical MR-HIFU
   platform. This approach resulted in accurate and precise heating within
   the targeted region with significantly lower acoustic pressures and
   spatially more confined heating in the beam path direction compared to
   the single focus sonication method. The reduction in acoustic pressure
   and improvement in spatial control suggest that multifoci heating is a
   useful tool in mild hyperthermia applications for clinical oncology. (C)

Abstract = {{Study Design. Biomechanical tensile testing of perinatal, neonatal, and
   pediatric cadaveric cervical spines to failure.
   Objective. To assess the tensile failure properties of the cervical
   spine from birth to adulthood.
   Summary of Background Data. Pediatric cervical spine biomechanical
   studies have been few due to the limited availability of pediatric
   cadavers. Therefore, scaled data based on human adult and juvenile
   animal studies have been used to augment the limited pediatric cadaver
   data. Despite these efforts, substantial uncertainty remains in our
   understanding of pediatric cervical spine biomechanics.
   Methods. A total of 24 cadaveric osteoligamentous head-neck complexes,
   20 weeks gestation to 18 years, were sectioned into segments (occiput-C2
   {[}O-C2], C4-C5, and C6-C7) and tested in tension to determine axial
   stiffness, displacement at failure, and load-to-failure.
   Results. Tensile stiffness-to-failure (N/mm) increased by age (O-C2:
   23-fold, neonate: 22 +/- 7, 18 yr: 504; C4-C5: 7-fold, neonate: 71 +/-
   14, 18 yr: 509; C6-C7: 7-fold, neonate: 64 +/- 17, 18 yr: 456).
   Load-to-failure (N) increased by age (O-C2: 13-fold, neonate: 228 +/-
   40, 18 yr: 2888; C4-C5: 9-fold, neonate: 207 +/- 63, 18 yr: 1831; C6-C7:
   10-fold, neonate: 174 +/- 41, 18 yr: 1720). Normalized displacement at
   failure (mm/mm) decreased by age (O-C2: 6-fold, neonate: 0.34 +/- 0.076,
   18 yr: 0.059; C4-C5: 3-old, neonate: 0.092 +/- 0.015, 18 yr: 0.035;
   C6-C7: 2-fold, neonate: 0.088 +/- 0.019, 18 yr: 0.037).
   Conclusion. Cervical spine tensile stiffness-to-failure and
   load-tofailure increased nonlinearly, whereas normalized displacement at
   failure decreased nonlinearly, from birth to adulthood. Pronounced
   ligamentous laxity observed at younger ages in the O-C2 segment
   quantitatively supports the prevalence of spinal cord injury without
   radiographic abnormality in the pediatric population. This study
   provides important and previously unavailable data for validating
   pediatric cervical spine models, for evaluating current scaling
   techniques and animal surrogate models, and for the development of more
   biofidelic pediatric crash test dummies.}},

Abstract = {{There are conflicting data regarding what motions increase ACL injury
   risk. More specifically, the mechanical role of valgus collapse
   positions during ACL injury remains controversial. Our objective was to
   evaluate ACL elongation in a model that mimics knee movements thought to
   occur during ACL injury. Eight healthy male subjects were imaged using
   MR and biplanar fluoroscopy to measure the in vivo elongation of the ACL
   and its functional bundles during three static knee positions: full
   extension, 30A degrees of flexion, and a position intended to mimic a
   valgus collapse position described in the literature. For this study,
   the valgus collapse position consisted of 30A degrees of knee flexion,
   internal rotation of the hip, and 10A degrees of external tibial
   rotation. ACL length decreased significantly from full extension (30.2
   +/- A 2.6 mm) to 30A degrees of flexion (27.1 +/- A 2.2 mm). ACL length
   further decreased in the valgus collapse position (25.6 +/- A 2.4 mm).
   Both functional bundles of the ACL followed similar trends with regards
   to decreases in length in each of the three positions. Since strain
   would follow patterns of ACL length, landing on an extended knee may be
   a more relevant risk factor for ACL injuries than the valgus collapse
   position in males. Future studies should evaluate the effects of dynamic
   motion patterns on in vivo ACL strains.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-60}},

Abstract = {{Very little is known about the mechanisms that occur in human cells upon
   exposure to fungi as well as their mycotoxins. A better understanding of
   toxin-regulated gene expression would be helpful to identify safe levels
   of exposure and could eventually be the basis for establishing
   guidelines for remediation scenarios following a water intrusion event.
   In this research, cytokine mRNA expression patterns were investigated in
   the human monocytic THP-1 cell line exposed to fungal extracts of
   various fragment sizes obtained from Stachybotrys chartarum RTI 5802
   and/or Aspergillus versicolor RTI 3843, two common and well-studied
   mycotoxin producing fungi. Cytokine mRNA expression was generally
   upregulated 210 times following a 24 h exposure to fungal extracts.
   Expression of the proinflammatory interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-8, and
   tumor necrosis factor-a genes increased while the anti-inflammatory gene
   interleukin-10 also increased albeit at very low level, suggesting that
   negative feedback regulation mechanism of production of proinflammatory
   cytokines initiated upon 24 h of incubation. In addition, submicron size
   extracts of A. versicolor caused significant death of THP-1 cells,
   whereas extracts of S. chartarum caused no cell death while the mixture
   of the two fungi had an intermediate effect. There was no general
   correlation between gene expression and fragment sizes, which suggests
   that all submicron fragments may contribute to inflammatory response.

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-28}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Invisibility is a notion that has long captivated the popular
   imagination. However, in 2006, invisibility became a practical matter
   for the scientific community as well, with the suggestion that
   artificially structured metamaterials could enable a new electromagnetic
   design paradigm, now termed transformation optics(1). Since the advent
   of transformation optics and subsequent initial demonstration of the
   microwave cloak(2), the field has grown rapidly. However, the complexity
   of the transformation optics material prescription has continually
   forced researchers to make simplifying approximations to achieve even a
   subset of the desired functionality(3-14). These approximations place
   profound limitations on the performance of transformation optics devices
   in general(11), and cloaks especially(15,16). Here, we design and
   experimentally characterize a two-dimensional, unidirectional cloak that
   makes no approximations to the underlying transformation optics
   formulation, yet is capable of reducing the scattering of an object ten
   wavelengths in size. We demonstrate that this approximation-free design
   regains the performance characteristics promised by transformation
   optics.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new constitutive model that unifies the behavioral
   characterizations of rubber-like materials in a broad range of loading
   regimes. The proposed model combines a selection of existing components
   that are known to reflect, with suitable accuracy, two fundamental
   aspects of rubber behavior in finite strain: (i) rate-independent
   softening under deformation, also known as the Mullins effect, and (ii)
   hyper-viscoelasticity, including at high strain rates. The evolution
   model is further generalized to account for multiple rates of internal
   dissipation (or material time-scales). Suitable means of identifying the
   system's parameters from simple uniaxial extension tests are explored.
   Several aspects of the model's behavior are shown in virtual experiments
   of uniaxial extension, at different stretch rates. A possible
   directional approach extending the model to handle softening induced
   anisotropy is briefly discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Microfabricated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) scaffolds may be
   applicable to tissue engineering heart valve leaflets by virtue of their
   controllable microstructure, stiffness, and elasticity. In this study,
   PGS scaffolds were computationally designed and microfabricated by laser
   ablation to match the anisotropy and peak tangent moduli of native
   bovine aortic heart valve leaflets. Finite element simulations predicted
   PGS curing conditions, scaffold pore shape, and strut width capable of
   matching the scaffold effective stiffnesses to the leaflet peak tangent
   moduli. On the basis of simulation predicted effective stiffnesses of
   1.041 and 0.208 MPa for the scaffold preferred (PD) and orthogonal,
   cross-preferred (XD) material directions, scaffolds with diamond-shaped
   pores were microfabricated by laser ablation of PGS cured 12 h at 160
   degrees C. Effective stiffnesses measured for the scaffold PD (0.83 +/-
   0.13 MPa) and XD (0.21 +/- 0.03 MPa) were similar to both predicted
   values and peak tangent moduli measured for bovine aortic valve leaflets
   in the circumferential (1.00 +/- 0.16 MPa) and radial (0.26 +/- 0.03
   MPa) directions. Scaffolds cultivated with fibroblasts for 3 weeks
   accumulated collagen (736 +/- 193 mu g/g wet weight) and DNA (17 +/- 4

   sensing (CS) for video. We propose a CS algorithm to adapt the
   compression ratio based on the scene's temporal complexity, computed

   manipulating the integration time of the camera, opening the possibility
   to real-time implementation. The proposed algorithm is a generalized

Abstract = {{In fields such as astronomy and medicine, many imaging modalities
   operate in the photon-limited realm because of the low photon counts
   available over a reasonable exposure time. Photon-limited observations
   are often modeled as the composite of a linear operator, such as a blur
   or tomographic projection, applied to a scene of interest, followed by
   Poisson noise draws for each pixel. One method to reconstruct the
   underlying scene intensity is to minimize a regularized Poisson negative
   log-likelihood, but choosing a good scaling parameter for the
   regularizer is notoriously difficult. This paper presents a new model
   that solves for and regularizes the logarithm of the true scene, and
   focuses on the special case of total variation regularization. This
   method yields considerable gains when used in conjunction with
   cross-validation for regularization parameter selection, where weighting
   of the regularization term is automatically determined using observed
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Splines are a popular and attractive way of smoothing noisy data.
   Computing splines involves minimizing a functional which is a linear
   combination of a fitting term and a regularization term. The former is
   classically computed using a (sometimes weighted) L2 norm while the
   latter ensures smoothness. In this work we propose to replace the L2
   norm in the fitting term with an L1 norm, leading to automatic
   robustness to outliers. To solve the resulting minimization problem we
   propose an extremely simple and efficient numerical scheme based on
   split-Bregman iteration and a DCT-based filter. The algorithm is applied
   to the problem of smoothing and impainting range data, where
   high-quality results are obtained in short processing times.}},

Abstract = {{Image foreground and background separation is an essential step in a
   variety of image processing, video analysis, and computer vision tasks.
   Typically, these methods accept streaming video data, compute an
   estimate of the background, and subtract this from the observed frames
   to generate a foreground scene. While such methods are very effective in
   high SNR regimes, they face serious limitations in low-light settings
   occurring in night vision surveillance and astronomy. Existing methods
   cannot be easily modified to yield good results. Therefore, new methods
   must be created to deal with the low light setting. This paper
   specifically addresses the problem of foreground and background
   separation and reconstruction in the case of Poisson distributed
   observations. The proposed approach builds upon recent advances in both
   the online learning community and sparse reconstruction methods for
   Poisson images. To aid in the reconstruction and separation tasks, the
   method learns and incorporates the dynamics of objects in both the
   background and foreground in real time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel approach to online convex programming in
   dynamic settings. Many existing online learning methods are
   characterized via regret bounds that quantify the gap between the
   performance of the online algorithm relative to a comparator. In
   previous work, this comparator was either considered static over time,
   or admitted sublinear tracking regret bounds only when the comparator
   was piecewise constant or slowly varying. In contrast, the proposed
   method determines the best dynamical model from a parametric family to
   incorporate into the prediction process, and admits regret bounds which
   scale with the deviation of a comparator from that dynamical model. In
   other words, this approach can yield low regret relative to highly
   variable, dynamic comparators. This result is proved for loss functions
   corresponding to the negative log likelihood associated with an
   exponential family probability distribution, and several properties of
   the exponential family are exploited to ensure low regret.}},

Abstract = {{A key finding within the current engineering education literature is
   that exposure to real-world applications especially when presented in an
   active, experiential learning environment increases both student
   interest and pedagogical effectiveness. This idea of contextual
   learning, learning designed so that students can carry out activities
   and solve problems in ways that reflect the real-world nature of such
   tasks, is based on cognitive learning theory and current research in
   cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Such research suggests that
   initial learning, transfer of that learning to other contexts, and
   retention of learned material is facilitated when concepts are presented
   in a familiar or relatable context. That is, students are motivated when
   learning has meaning.
   The National Academy of Engineering recently outlined fourteen Grand
   Challenges for Engineering (e.g., ``Reverse Engineering the Brain{''})
   that collectively constitute some of the largest and most pressing
   real-world issues facing engineering research and practice. We have
   developed an instructional framework for engineering education that
   utilizes these Grand Challenges as the context for teaching a wide range
   of concepts. The framework comprises six stages, each building upon its
   predecessor. Students first progress from thinking about the grand,
   overarching theme from a multitude of perspectives to focusing on a
   discipline-specific view of the challenge (Stages 1-3). Then, they
   concentrate on learning the specific course content and applying what
   they have learned to a specific, real-world problem inspired by the
   overarching Grand Challenge (Stages 4-5). Finally, they analyze what
   they have learned from the hands-on activities and reflect back on how
   this can inform their understanding of, and solutions to, the Grand
   Challenge (Stage 6).
   This paper begins with a description of the framework including its
   foundation in contextual learning theory and the motivation for using
   the Grand Challenges. Subsequently, the implementation of the framework
   in two engineering courses is described. Details of the learning modules
   and activities corresponding to the six stages of the framework are
   presented for each course. Similarities and differences in
   implementation are highlighted, illustrating how a common framework can
   be applied to seemingly very different courses. Finally, the use of the
   framework is evaluated in terms of its impact on student motivation and
   learning using psychologically rigorous measures.}},

Abstract = {{Few conferences set out to examine the impact they have on attendees and
   whether or not they have met their goals and perhaps research questions
   beyond a simple satisfaction survey. This study uses surveys and
   interviews to examine the influence of the STEM Think Tank and
   Conference 2012 (TT\&C), hosted by the Center for STEM Education for
   Girls, on its attendees (i.e. K-12 teachers, K-12 administrators,
   university faculties, and industry). We set out to define how the TT\&C
   influenced the attendees' professional connections, both in type and
   number, and how teachers' experiences at the TT\&C affected their future
   use of STEM integration in their classroom. Eighteen teachers
   participated in a pre-conference survey to establish baseline data, and
   fourteen of these teachers completed the post-conference survey. The
   pre-conference surveys addressed attendees' current professional
   connections and use of STEM integration. The post-conference surveys
   readdressed attendees' thoughts on professional connections and STEM
   integration, as well as their TT\&C experience. We chose to follow up
   with six teachers in interviews at the end of the TT\&C to pursue some
   topics in more depth. These interviews, which followed up on the
   attendees' responses to pre-conference surveys, were categorized into
   subthemes related to professional connections and STEM integration. The
   interviews were complimented by the data comparison of the pre and
   post-conference surveys. In summary, attendees increased their
   connections at the TT\&C. Teachers thought of ways to utilize their new
   connections in their profession (such as teacher-industry and
   teacher-university collaborations) and use these connections to help
   enact STEM into their courses. Participants took STEM integration tools
   and ideas from the TT\&C. Having attended the TT\&C the participants
   were more confident in enacting STEM into their classrooms and within
   their schools.}},

Abstract = {{As universities explore options for the delivery of high quality degree
   programs to distance learners, some students will look for innovative
   offerings that combine virtual instruction with elements of face-to-face
   interaction. Distance learners often select programs that support the
   asynchronous delivery of core classroom material to retain the momentum
   of established careers and better manage work-life commitments. There is
   additional value in distance education opportunities that combine a
   flexible, academically rigorous curriculum with a personalized approach
   to create and sustain a supportive community for remote candidates. The
   existence of such a community can ultimately increase the potential for
   long-term academic success.
   A low-residency version of an established graduate level Engineering
   Management program was launched at Duke University in 2009. This
   cohort-driven model utilizes a blended classroom to include distance and
   campus students in shared course sections each semester. Distance
   content is delivered in the form of recorded classroom lectures posted
   online weekly. The distributed program participants are predominantly
   employed on a full-time basis and typically complete the degree in two
   years. The credit requirements are identical for both distance and
   campus students. The remote candidates must, however, attend three
   weeklong residencies on campus to graduate.
   This paper will detail the types of activities that can promote the
   development of an engaging distance learning community through an
   analysis of the four cohorts enrolled to date. Surveys distributed to a
   representative sample of distance students will be used to examine the
   experiences that were most effective in fostering connections with
   faculty, staff, and other students. Focal areas for assessment will
   include: community membership, key activities for relationship building,
   sources of program support, and communication channels.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial dispersion of action potential duration has been linked to
   arrhythmogenesis in the diseased heart; however, the complex dynamic
   between repolarization dynamics and microstructural heterogeneity in
   critical regimes is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to
   use microstructural computer models of adult monolayers to study the
   effect of abrupt tissue expansion and gap junction uncoupling on
   dispersion of action potential duration (APD) during premature
   stimulation. Two- dimensional discrete and equivalent continuous
   computer models (dx= 10 mu m, dy= 10 mu m) of ventricular monolayers
   with isthmus strands connected to a load region were generated. In the
   discrete model, gap junctions (g(J)) with a value between 0.005 mu S and
   0.50 mu S were uniformly distributed around individual cells. In strands
   with a width of 300 mu m, decreasing gap junction coupling in the
   discrete model increased variation in APD at the site of abrupt
   expansion by as much as 6 ms and changed the APD profile at the
   expansion site from an elliptical to a bipolar configuration. In narrow
   strands with a width of 60 flm, uniformly decreasing coupling in both
   the strand and the load increased variation in APD by as much as 14 ms
   and facilitated propagation at the expansion site. The equivalent
   continuous model could not reproduce microstructural variations in APD,
   the pattern of conduction block observed in moderately coupled tissue or
   the conduction delay observed at the site of abrupt expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to build quantum computers using ion-traps have demonstrated all
   elementary qubit operations necessary for scalable implementation.
   Modular architectures have been proposed to construct modest size
   quantum computers with up to 10(4) - 10(6) qubits using technologies
   that are available today (MUSIQC architecture). Concrete scheduling
   procedure to execute a given quantum algorithm on such a hardware is a
   significant task, but existing quantum CAD tools generally do not
   account for the underlying connectivity of the qubits or the limitation
   on the hardware resources available for the scheduling. We present a
   scheduler and performance simulator that fully accounts for these
   resource constraints, capable of estimating the execution time and error
   performances of executing a quantum circuit on the hardware. We outline
   the construction of tool components, and describe the process of mapping
   the qubits to ions and scheduling the physical gates in the MUSIQC
   architecture. Using this tool, we quantify the trade-off between
   hardware resource constraints and performance of the computer and show
   that at an expense of x fold increase in latency, a minimum of 1.6x
   resource reduction is possible for executing a three-qubit
   Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm encoded using Steane code.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a mobile sensor can be greatly improved by planning
   its path with respect to its sensing objective, field-of-view, and
   platform geometry. Although many algorithms have been developed for the
   related field of robot path planning, a majority of these methodologies
   cannot be directly applied to the problem of sensor path planning. This
   paper presents a technique by which mixed-integer programming (MIP) can
   be used to determine the optimal path of a mobile sensor. MIP is able to
   return solutions in non-convex environments, and has a flexible
   framework that allows for the consideration of vehicle dynamics,
   obstacle avoidance, and, as shown here, target measurement objectives.
   The primary contribution of this work is the development of a poof of
   the duality of robot and sensor path planning. By use of MIP, the proof
   shows that many approaches to classical robot navigation problems can be
   reformulated for sensor path planning. Illustrative simulation results
   for the paths of mobile robots and sensor platforms are presented;
   MATLAB and Tomlab/CPLEX were used to solve the path optimization
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we control image collection for a mobile stereo camera
   that is actively localizing a group of mobile targets. In particular,
   assuming that at least one pair of stereo images of the targets is
   available, we propose a novel approach to control the rotation and
   translation of the stereo camera so that the next observation of the
   targets will minimize their localization uncertainty. We call this
   problem the Next-Best-View problem for mobile targets (mNBV). The
   advantage of using a stereo camera is that, using triangulation, the two
   simultaneous images taken by the robot during a single observation can
   yield range and bearing measurements of the targets, as well as their
   uncertainty. A Kalman filter fuses the full state history and covariance
   estimates, as more measurements are acquired. Our solution to the mNBV
   problem determines the relative transformations between camera and
   targets that will minimize the fused uncertainty of the targets'
   locations. We determine a motion plan that realizes the mNBV while
   respecting field of view constraints. In particular, with every new
   observation, we compute a new mNBV in the frame relative to the camera
   and subsequently realize this view in global coordinates via a gradient
   descent algorithm that also respects field of view constraints.
   Integration of mNBV with motion planning results in a hybrid system,
   which we illustrate in computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Several approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms have been
   developed and demonstrated for the model-free control of continuous and
   discrete dynamical systems. However, their applicability to hybrid
   systems that involve both discrete and continuous state and control
   variables has yet to be demonstrated in the literature. This paper
   presents an ADP approach for hybrid systems (hybrid-ADP) that obtains
   the optimal control law and discrete action sequence via online
   learning. New recursive relationships for hybrid-ADP are presented for
   switched hybrid systems that are possibly nonlinear. In order to
   demonstrate the ability of the proposed ADP algorithm to converge to the
   optimal solution, the approach is demonstrated on a switched, linear
   hybrid system with a quadratic cost function, for which there exists an
   analytical solution. The results show that the ADP algorithm is capable
   of converging to the optimal switched control law, by minimizing the
   cost-to-go online, based on an observable state vector.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of computing optimal state and control
   trajectories for a multiscale dynamical system comprised of many
   interacting dynamical systems, or agents. A generalized reduced gradient
   (GRG) approach is presented for distributed optimal control (DOC)
   problems in which the agent dynamics are described by a small system of
   stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A new set of optimality
   conditions is derived using calculus of variations, and used to compute
   the optimal macroscopic state and microscopic control laws. An indirect
   GRG approach is used to solve the optimality conditions numerically for
   large systems of agents. By assuming a parametric control law obtained
   from the superposition of linear basis functions, the agent control laws
   can be determined via set- point regulation, such that the macroscopic
   behavior of the agents is optimized over time, based on multiple,
   interactive navigation objectives.}},

   the sampling rate required is sub-Nyquist when compared to the bandwidth

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a near-field reduced rank adaptive beamforming
   method for nulling more interferers than sensors using fully augmentable
   arrays in wide sense stationary interference. Augmentable arrays, such
   as minimally redundant or co-prime, can exploit additional degrees of
   freedom beyond the number of sensors in spatially stationary fields in
   order to increase array gain. However, near-field targets result in
   spatial non-stationarity due to range dependent wavefront curvature.
   Additionally, source or array motion limits the number of available
   snapshots. Adaptive near-field beamforming with far-field interference
   suppression is considered by nulling in the augmented, or co-array,
   dimensions but steering in the near-field with sensors in their physical
   locations. A reduced rank processing scheme is used that requires fewer
   snapshots than full rank methods. The proposed technique is shown to
   increase array gain when the number of interferers exceeds the number of
   sensors in both high and low snapshot support regions.}},

   hierarchical subspace tracking, which leverages recent advances in
   consensus over wireless networks in order to track subspaces when
   communications and measurements occur on the same timescale. It is shown
   that the resource consumption of hierarchical subspace tracking scales
   slowly in the size of the network. Further, it is shown that the

   Unlike relevant techniques in existing literature that decompose the
   problem with respect to the possible realizations of the random
   parameters, our approach can be applied to networked systems that lack a
   central processing unit and require autonomous decision making by the
   network nodes. Our method relies on the recently proposed Accelerated

   offer an asymptotic characterization of the behavior of the (upper bound

   Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) classifier that depends on quantities that
   are dual to the concepts of diversity gain and coding gain in
   multi-antenna communications. The diversity, which is shown to determine
   the rate at which the probability of misclassification decays in the low
   noise regime, is shown to depend on the geometry of the source, the
   geometry of the measurement system and their interplay. The measurement
   gain, which represents the counterpart of the coding gain, is also shown
   to depend on geometrical quantities. It is argued that the diversity
   order and the measurement gain also offer an optimization criterion to

Abstract = {{Codes for distributed storage systems are often designed to sustain
   failure of multiple storage disks. Specifically, an (n, k) MDS code
   stores k symbols in n disks such that the overall system is tolerant to
   a failure of up to n - k disks. However, access to at least k disks is
   still required to repair a single erasure. To reduce repair bandwidth,
   array codes are used where the stored symbols or packets are vectors of
   length l. MDS array codes can potentially repair a single erasure using
   a fraction 1/(n - k) of data stored in the surviving nodes. We ask the
   following question: for a given (n, k), what is the minimum
   vector-length or sub-packetization factor l required to achieve this
   optimal fraction? For exact recovery of systematic disks in an MDS code
   of low redundancy, i.e. k/n > 1/2, the best known explicit codes {[}1]
   have a sub-packetization factor L which is exponential in k. It has been
   conjectured {[}2] that for a fixed number of parity nodes, it is in fact
   necessary for l to be exponential in k. In this paper, we provide new
   converse bounds on k for a given l. We prove that k <= l(2) for an
   arbitrary but fixed number of parity nodes r = n - k. For the practical
   case of 2 parity nodes, we prove a stronger result that k <= 4l.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel tracking algorithm for an autonomous vehicle equipped
   with a single camera. Given only monocular visual data, our algorithm
   utilizes projective geometry to compute concise features of the
   environment. Using these features, road markings are identified by a
   multi-class classifier. The classification results are then used with a
   Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to track the vehicle as it moves back
   and forth across the road. The resulting position tracker is part of a
   complete, simulated autonomous driving system. The realistic driving
   video game Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit was used as a vehicle simulation
   platform, and the autonomous system is shown to perform competitively
   against the game's automated opponents.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC MAMMALS}},

Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{356-377}},
Abstract = {{Marine seismic surveys, which use loud, primarily low-frequency sound to
   penetrate the sea floor, are known to disturb and could harm marine
   life. The use of these surveys for conventional and alternative offshore
   energy development as well as research is expanding. Given their
   proliferation and potential for negative environmental impact, there is
   a growing need for systematic planning and operational standards to
   eliminate or at least minimize impacts, especially when surveys occur in
   sensitive areas. Mitigating immediate impacts is obviously critical, but
   monitoring for short-as well as long-term effects and impacts is also
   needed. Regulatory requirements for both mitigation and monitoring vary
   widely from one country or jurisdiction to another. Historically, most
   have focused on acute effects but share a common objective of minimizing
   potential adverse impacts. Specific examples in different areas are
   given to illustrate general approaches for predicting, minimizing, and
   measuring impacts for operations in essentially any marine environment.
   The critical elements of a robust mitigation and monitoring plan for
   responsibly conducting marine seismic surveys include obtaining baseline
   ecological data; substantial advance planning, communication, and
   critical review; integrated acoustic and visual monitoring during
   operations; and systematic analysis of results to inform future planning
   and mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this project is to combine two renewable energy
   conversion technologies (low-temperature fuel cells and solarthermal
   collectors) to achieve synergies in terms of cost and energetic
   efficiency compared to systems based on a single energy source and
   energy conversion technology. Direct solar-to-electric energy
   conversion, such as photovoltaics, is currently not economically
   competitive with traditional electric power generation. Fuel cell
   technology using alcoholic fuel possibly generated from biomass (e.g.
   methanol) is not competitive in terms of costs either. The system
   proposed for this project is based on relatively cheap, commercially
   available hardware components (intermediate-temperature solar collector,
   pressurized gas tank, hydrogen-fed Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel
   cell) and benefits in terms of energetic efficiency from the cost-free
   supply of solar heat. By applying micro-fabrication technology and
   nano-scale structures (e.g. for catalytic surfaces), the efficiency of
   all individual system components and of the entire system can be
   increased drastically.
   The catalytic activity of micro-reactors containing this foam-like
   ceramic is tested in terms of their ability to convert alcoholic biofuel
   (e.g. methanol) to a hydrogenrich gas mixture with low concentrations of
   carbon monoxide (up to 75\% hydrogen content and less than 0.2\% CO, for
   the case of methanol). This gas mixture is subsequently used in a
   low-temperature fuel cell, converting the hydrogen directly to
   electricity. A low concentration of CO is crucial to avoid poisoning of
   the fuel cell catalyst. Since conventional Polymer Electrolyte Membrane
   (PEM) fuel cells require CO concentrations far below 100 ppm and since
   most methods to reduce the mole fraction of CO (such as Preferential
   Oxidation or PROX) have CO conversions of up to 99\%, the alcohol fuel
   reformer has to achieve initial CO mole fractions significantly below
   1\%. The catalyst and the porous ceramic reactor of the present study
   can successfully fulfill this requirement.}},

Title = {{High sugar Eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L) cultivars as

Journal = {{MAYDICA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1-4, SI}},
Pages = {{60-66}},
Abstract = {{Maize (Zea mays L) is the leading biofuel crop in the United States.
   Production of ethanol from maize requires relatively high energy inputs
   from petroleum-based products. The net energy required for growing maize
   and consequent contribution to atmospheric CO2 make using maize for
   ethanol production inefficient. Warm season perennial grasses have
   excellent potential as alternative biofuel feedstocks. However, one of
   the drawbacks of using these grasses is their high lignin content, which
   restricts breakdown of cellulose into carbohydrates and sugar for
   fermentation into ethanol. This results in low net ethanol yield, a
   major challenge for biofuel production from cellulosic feedstocks.
   Eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L) is a warm season native
   American grass related to maize. To evaluate potential of Eastern
   gamagrass and gamagrass-Zea recombinant lines as a biofuel feedstock,
   seven varieties were analyzed for their chemical composition and
   fermentable sugar production. Based on total sugar yield, gamagrass-Zea
   recombinant cultivars Eagle Point Devil Corn and Sun Devil reached 595.8
   and 456.5 mg g(-1) raw biomass, respectively. Compared to the other
   gamagrass varieties and energy crops switchgrass and bermudagrass, these
   gamagrass-Zea recombinants gave a significantly higher (P<0.05) sugar
   yield. DNA fingerprinting revealed Sun Devil contains introgressed Zea
   alleles at three loci associated with sugar synthesis. At theoretical
   yield of 386.1 liters of ethanol per ton of dry biomass, the Eagle Point
   Devil Corn cultivar has potential as a high yielding biofuel feedstock.
   The next step will be to conduct agronomic studies to evaluate field
   performance and biomass yield of this promising new feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{The harmonic balance method is a mixed time domain and frequency domain
   approach for efficiently solving periodic unsteady flows. The
   implementation described in this paper is designed to efficiently handle
   the multiple frequencies that arise within a multistage turbomachine due
   to differing blade counts in each blade row. We present two alternative
   algorithms that can be used to determine which unique set of frequencies
   to consider in each blade row. The first, an all blade row algorithm,
   retains the complete set offrequencies produced by a given blade row's
   interaction with all other blade rows. The second, a nearest neighbor
   algorithm, retains only the dominant frequencies in a given blade row
   that arise from direct interaction with the adjacent rows. A comparison
   of results from a multiple blade row simulation based on these two
   approaches is presented. We will demonstrate that unsteady blade row
   interactions are accurately captured with the reduced frequency set of
   the nearest neighbor algorithm, and at a lower computational cost
   compared to the all blade row algorithm.
   An unsteady simulation of a two-stage, cooled, high pressure turbine
   cascade is achieved using the present harmonic balance method and the
   nearest neighbor algorithm. The unsteady results obtained are compared
   to steady simulation results to demonstrate the value of performing an
   unsteady analysis. Considering an unsteady flow through a single blade
   row turbine blade passage, it is further shown that unsteady effects are
   important even if the objective is to obtain accurate time-averaged
   integrated values, such as efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Regenerative medicine offers the exciting potential of developing
   alternatives to total joint replacement for treating osteoarthritis. In
   this article, we highlight recent work that addresses key challenges of
   stem cell-based therapies for osteoarthritis and provide examples of
   innovative ways in which stem cells can aid in the treatment of
   osteoarthritis.
   Recent findings
   Significant progress has been made in understanding the challenges to
   successful stem cell therapy, such as the effects of age or disease on
   stem cell properties, altered stem cell function due to an inflammatory
   joint environment and phenotypic instability in vivo. Novel scaffold
   designs have been shown to enhance the mechanical properties of
   tissue-engineered cartilage and have also improved the integration of
   newly formed tissue within the joint. Emerging strategies such as
   injecting stem cells directly into the joint, manipulating endogenous
   stem cells to enhance regenerative capacity and utilizing stem cells for
   drug discovery have expanded the potential uses of stem cells in
   treating osteoarthritis.
   Summary
   Several recent studies have greatly advanced the development and
   preclinical evaluation of potential stem cell-based treatments for
   osteoarthritis through novel approaches focused on cell therapy, tissue
   engineering and drug discovery.}},

Journal = {{BIOPOLYMERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-62}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) fusions have been designed to allow
   large-scale, nonchromatographic purification of many soluble proteins by
   using the inverse transition cycling (ITC) method; however, the
   sensitivity of the aqueous lower critical solubility phase transition
   temperature (Tt) of ELPs to the addition of cosolutes, including
   detergents, may be a potential hindrance in purification of proteins
   with surface hydrophobicity in such a manner. To identify detergents
   that are known to solubilize such proteins (e.g., membrane proteins) and
   that have little effect on the Tt of the ELP, we screened a number of
   detergents with respect to their effects on the Tt and secondary
   structures of a model ELP (denoted here as ELP180). We found that mild
   detergents (e.g., n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, Triton-X100, and
   3-{[}(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylamino]-1-propanesulfonate) do not alter
   the phase transition behavior or structure (as probed by circular
   dichroism) of ELP180. This result is in contrast to previous studies
   that showed a strong effect of other detergents (e.g., sodium
   dodecylsulfate) on the Tt of ELPs. Our results clearly indicate that
   mild detergents do not preclude ITC-based separation of ELPs, and thus
   that ELP fusions may prove to be useful in the purification of
   detergent-solubilized recombinant hydrophobic proteins, including
   membrane proteins, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to extract
   and purify by conventional separation methods (e.g., chromatography).

Abstract = {{A vegetation disturbance persistence metric based on Moderate-Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer North American Carbon Program vegetation
   indices (8-day composite at 500 m spatial resolution) was developed with
   the objective of assessing the eco-hydrological impact of extreme events
   generally, and hurricanes and tropical cyclones in particular, in the
   southeastern USA. The metric is based on the relationship between
   vegetation stress and the persistence of standardized enhanced
   vegetation index anomalies. The data show that in the first water year
   (October-September) after hurricane landfall, pronounced decreases in
   chlorophyll activity are found predominantly at very low elevations -
   including coastal marshes, wetlands, and the floodplains aligned with
   drainage networks of major river systems along the storm track. Inland
   impacts are mainly located in agricultural areas and woody wetlands in
   the floodplains, and in forested headwater basins in the mountains.
   Overall, the data analysis indicates that the major impacts of these
   storms are on agricultural and natural land-margin ecosystems
   predominantly via flooding associated with the storm surge along the
   coast, and flood propagation through the river networks inland. The
   timescale of impacts in coastal areas is up to two years, consistent
   with persistent impacts of salt intrusion in shallow coastal aquifers,
   erosion of root zone soils, and depletion of nutrients due to flooding.
   By contrast, ecological drought disturbance patterns exhibit larger
   spatial persistence but significantly shorter timescales (3-4 months).}},

Abstract = {{Reports of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) song chorusing
   occurring outside the breeding grounds are becoming more common, but
   song structure and underwater behavior of individual singers on feeding
   grounds and migration routes remain unknown. Here, ten humpback whales
   in the Western Antarctic Peninsula were tagged in May 2010 with
   non-invasive, suction-cup attached tags to study foraging ecology and
   acoustic behavior. Background song was identified on all ten records,
   but additionally, acoustic records of two whales showed intense and
   continuous singing, with a level of organization and structure
   approaching that of typical breeding ground song. The songs, produced
   either by the tagged animals or close associates, shared phrase types
   and theme structure with one another, and some song bouts lasted close
   to an hour. Dive behavior of tagged animals during the time of sound
   production showed song occurring during periods of active diving,
   sometimes to depths greater than 100 m. One tag record also contained
   song in the presence of feeding lunges identified from the behavioral
   sensors, indicating that mating displays occur in areas worthy of
   foraging. These data show behavioral flexibility as the humpbacks manage
   competing needs to continue to feed and to prepare for the breeding
   season during late fall. This may also signify an ability to engage in
   breeding activities outside of the traditional, warm water breeding
   ground locations.}},

Title = {{Changes in the Molecular Phenotype of Nucleus Pulposus Cells with
   Intervertebral Disc Aging}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Intervertebral disc (IVD) disorder and age-related degeneration are
   believed to contribute to low back pain. Cell-based therapies represent
   a promising strategy to treat disc degeneration; however, the cellular
   and molecular characteristics of disc cells during IVD maturation and
   aging still remain poorly defined. This study investigated novel
   molecular markers and their age-related changes in the rat IVD.
   Affymetrix cDNA microarray analysis was conducted to identify a new set
   of genes characterizing immature nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Among
   these markers, select neuronal-related proteins (Basp1, Ncdn and Nrp-1),
   transcriptional factor (Brachyury T), and cell surface receptors (CD24,
   CD90, CD155 and CD221) were confirmed by real-time PCR and
   immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for differential expression between
   IVD tissue regions and among various ages (1, 12 and 21 months). NP
   cells generally possessed higher levels of mRNA or protein expression
   for all aforementioned markers, with the exception of CD90 in anulus
   fibrosus (AF) cells. In addition, CD protein (CD24 and CD90) and
   Brachyury (T) expression in immature disc cells were also confirmed via
   flow cytometry. Similar to IHC staining, results revealed a higher
   percentage of immature NP cells expressing CD24 and Brachyury, while
   higher percentage of immature AF cells was stained positively for CD90.
   Altogether, this study identifies that tissue-specific gene expression
   and age-related differential expression of the above markers do exist in
   immature and aged disc cells. These age-related phenotype changes
   provide a new insight for a molecular profile that may be used to
   characterize NP cells for developing cell-based regenerative therapy for
   IVD regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental approaches were employed to study the
   effect of aggregation on the affinity between nanoparticles (NPs) and a
   flat surface that is quantified by the attachment efficiency. Computer
   simulations were used to generate virtual aggregates formed via either
   diffusion limited cluster aggregation or reaction limited cluster
   aggregation. The colloidal interactions between the simulated aggregates
   and a flat surface were evaluated based on the surface element
   integration approach. It was found that the strength of colloidal
   interaction for the aggregated NPs was on the same order of magnitude as
   those for the primary particles and was significantly weaker than that
   for an equivalent sphere defined by the gyration radius of the
   aggregate. The results from the deposition experiments using quartz
   crystal microbalance suggested that the attachment efficiencies
   (unfavorable deposition) for aggregated NPs were higher at the initial
   stage but later became similar to that of the primary NPs when
   equilibrium deposition was reached. The high initial affinity was
   postulated to be attributable to secondary minimum deposition. These
   results suggest that it is the size of the primary particles, not that
   of the aggregates, that determines the strength of the colloidal
   interaction between the aggregate and an environmental surface.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Survival analyses of a large cohort of published lumbar
   spine compression fatigue tests.
   Objective. To produce the first large-scale evaluation of human lumbar
   spine tolerance to repetitive compressive loading and to evaluate and
   improve guidelines for human exposure to whole-body vibration and
   repeated mechanical shock environments.
   Summary of Background Data. Several studies have examined the effects of
   compressive cyclic loading on the lumbar spine. However, no previous
   effort has coalesced these studies and produced an injury risk analysis
   with an expanded sample size. Guidelines have been developed for
   exposure limits to repetitive loading (e. g., ISO 2631-5), but there has
   been no large-scale verification of the standard against experimental
   data.
   Methods. Survival analyses were performed using the results of 77 male
   and 28 female cadaveric spinal segment fatigue tests from 6 previously
   published studies. Segments were fixed at each end and exposed to axial
   cyclic compression. The effects of the number of cycles, load amplitude,
   sex, and age were examined through the use of survival analyses.
   Results. Number of cycles, load amplitude, sex, and age all are
   significant factors in the likelihood of bony failure in the spinal
   column. Using a modification of the risk prediction parameter from ISO
   2631-5, an injury risk model was developed, which relates risk of
   vertebral failure to repeated compressive loading. The model predicts
   lifetime risks less than 7\% for industrial machinery exposure from
   axial compression alone. There was a 38\% risk for a high-speed planing
   craft operator, consistent with epidemiological evidence.
   Conclusion. A spinal fatigue model which predicts the risk of in vitro
   lumbar spinal failure within a narrow confidence interval has been
   developed. Age and sex were found to have significant effects on fatigue
   strength, with sex differences extending beyond those accounted for by
   endplate area disparities.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical study of the elastic properties of bulk
   nanocrystalline materials based on a continuum theory, introduced by
   Fried and Gurtin (2009), for nanoscale polycrystalline elasticity that
   captures length-scale effects and accounts for interactions across grain
   boundaries via interface and junction conditions. The theory involves a
   balance equation containing fourth-order gradients of the displacement
   field. A relatively inexpensive, non-conforming finite-element method
   based on C-0-continuous basis functions is presented. We develop the
   variational form of the method and establish consistency. The
   formulation weakly enforces continuity of derivatives of the
   displacement field across interelement boundaries and stabilization is
   achieved via Nitsche's method. Based on this approach, numerical studies
   are performed for a polycrystal subject to an uniaxial deformation.
   Results indicate that the theory predicts lower Young's modulus for bulk
   nanocrystalline materials than for conventional coarsely-grained
   polycrystals. Moreover, as the grain size decreases below a certain
   threshold, the effective elastic modulus decreases and the effective
   Poisson's ratio increases. The distribution of the effective stress
   shows that the theory captures high strain gradients in the vicinity of
   the grain boundaries and triple junctions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Regulation of Trabecular Meshwork Cell Contraction and Intraocular
   Pressure by miR-200c}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) delays or prevents the loss of
   vision in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients with high IOP and
   in those with normal tension glaucoma showing progression. Abundant
   evidence demonstrates that inhibition of contractile machinery of the
   trabecular meshwork cells is an effective method to lower IOP. However,
   the mechanisms involved in the regulation of trabecular contraction are
   not well understood. Although microRNAs have been shown to play
   important roles in the regulation of multiple cellular functions, little
   is known about their potential involvement in the regulation of IOP.
   Here, we showed that miR-200c is a direct postranscriptional inhibitor
   of genes relevant to the physiologic regulation of TM cell contraction
   including the validated targets Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and
   2 (ZEB1 and ZEB2), and formin homology 2 domain containing 1 (FHOD1), as
   well as three novel targets: lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1
   (LPAR1/EDG2), endothelin A receptor (ETAR), and RhoA kinase (RHOA).
   Consistently, transfection of TM cells with miR-200c resulted in strong
   inhibition of contraction in collagen populated gels as well as
   decreased cell traction forces exerted by individual TM cells. Finally,
   delivery of miR-200c to the anterior chamber of living rat eyes resulted
   in a significant decrease in IOP, while inhibition of miR-200c using an
   adenoviral vector expressing a molecular sponge led to a significant
   increase in IOP. These results demonstrate for the first time the
   ability of a miRNA to regulate trabecular contraction and modulate IOP
   in vivo, making miR-200c a worthy candidate for exploring ways to alter
   trabecular contractility with therapeutic purposes in glaucoma.}},

Abstract = {{Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is a recommended treatment for breast
   cancer patients where the goal is to remove the tumor and a surrounding
   rim of normal tissue. Unfortunately, a high percentage of patients
   return for additional surgeries to remove all of the cancer.
   Post-operative pathology is the gold standard for evaluating BCS margins
   but is limited due to the amount of tissue that can be sampled. Frozen
   section analysis and touch-preparation cytology have been proposed to
   address the surgical needs but also have sampling limitations. These
   issues represent an unmet clinical need for guidance in resecting
   malignant tissue intra-operatively and for pathological sampling. We
   have developed a quantitative spectral imaging device to examine margins
   intra-operatively. The context in which this technology is applied
   (intra-operative or post-operative setting) is influenced by time after
   excision and surgical factors including cautery and the presence of
   patent blue dye (specifically Lymphazurin(TM), used for sentinel lymph
   node mapping). Optical endpoints of hemoglobin ({[}THb]), fat
   ({[}beta-carotene]), and fibroglandular content via light scattering
   (<mu s'>) measurements were quantified from diffuse reflectance spectra
   of lumpectomy and mastectomy specimens using a Monte Carlo model. A
   linear longitudinal mixed-effects model was used to fit the optical
   endpoints for the cautery and kinetics studies. Monte Carlo simulations
   and tissue mimicking phantoms were used for the patent blue dye
   experiments. {[}THb], {[}beta-carotene], and <mu s'> were affected by <
   3.3\% error with < 80 mu M of patent blue dye. The percent change in
   {[}beta-carotene], <mu s'>, and {[}beta-carotene]/<mu s'>. was < 14\% in
   30 minutes, while percent change in {[}THb] was > 40\%.
   {[}beta-carotene] and {[}beta-carotene]/<mu s'>. were the only
   parameters not affected by cautery. This work demonstrates the
   importance of understanding the post-excision kinetics of ex-vivo tissue
   and the presence of cautery and patent blue dye for breast tumor margin
   assessment, to accurately interpret data and exploit underling sources
   of contrast.}},

Abstract = {{We study the dynamics of systems with deterministic trajectories
   randomly forced by instantaneous discontinuous jumps occurring according
   to two different compound Poisson processes. One process, with constant
   frequency, causes instantaneous positive random increments, whereas the
   second process has a state-dependent frequency and describes negative
   jumps that force the system to restart from zero (renewal jumps). We
   obtain the probability distributions of the state variable and the
   magnitude and intertimes of the jumps to zero. This modelling framework
   is used to describe snow-depth dynamics on mountain hillsides, where the
   positive jumps represent snowfall events, whereas the jumps to zero
   describe avalanches. The probability distributions of snow depth,
   together with the statistics of avalanche magnitude and occurrence, are
   used to explain the correlation between avalanche occurrence and
   snowfall as a function of hydrologic, terrain slope and aspect
   parameters. This information is synthesized into a `prediction entropy'
   function that gives the level of confidence of avalanche occurrence
   prediction in relation to terrain properties.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and tunable absorption is essential for a variety of
   applications, such as designing controlled-emissivity surfaces for
   thermophotovoltaic devices(1), tailoring an infrared spectrum for
   controlled thermal dissipation(2) and producing detector elements for
   imaging(3). Metamaterials based on metallic elements are particularly
   efficient as absorbing media, because both the electrical and the
   magnetic properties of a metamaterial can be tuned by structured
   design(4). So far, metamaterial absorbers in the infrared or visible
   range have been fabricated using lithographically patterned metallic
   structures(2,5-9), making them inherently difficult to produce over
   large areas and hence reducing their applicability. Here we demonstrate
   a simple method to create a metamaterial absorber by randomly adsorbing
   chemically synthesized silver nanocubes onto a nanoscale-thick polymer
   spacer layer on a gold film, making no effort to control the spatial
   arrangement of the cubes on the film. We show that the film-coupled
   nanocubes provide a reflectance spectrum that can be tailored by varying
   the geometry (the size of the cubes and/or the thickness of the spacer).
   Each nanocube is the optical analogue of a grounded patch antenna, with
   a nearly identical local field structure that is modified by the
   plasmonic response of the metal's dielectric function, and with an
   anomalously large absorption efficiency that can be partly attributed to
   an interferometric effect(10). The absorptivity of large surface areas
   can be controlled using this method, at scales out of reach of
   lithographic approaches (such as electron-beam lithography) that are
   otherwise required to manipulate matter on the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for 3D
   structure determination of protein complexes by averaging information
   from individual molecular images. The resolutions that can be achieved
   with single-particle cryo-EM are frequently limited by inaccuracies in
   assigning molecular orientations based solely on 2D projection images.
   Tomographic data collection schemes, however, provide powerful
   constraints that can be used to more accurately determine molecular
   orientations necessary for 3D reconstruction. Here, we propose
   ``constrained single-particle tomography{''} as a general strategy for
   3D structure determination in cryo-EM. A key component of our approach
   is the effective use of images recorded in tilt series to extract
   high-resolution information and correct for the contrast transfer
   function. By incorporating geometric constraints into the refinement to
   improve orientational accuracy of images, we reduce model bias and
   overrefinement artifacts and demonstrate that protein structures can be
   determined at resolutions of similar to 8 angstrom starting from
   low-dose tomographic tilt series.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of films formed by the adsorption of oligo(ethylene glycol)
   (OEG) functionalized trichlorosilanes on glass to UV light from a
   frequency-doubled argon ion laser (244 nm) causes photodegradation of
   the OEG chain. Although the rate of degradation is substantially slower
   than for monolayers of OEG terminated thiolates on gold, it is
   nevertheless possible to form micrometer-scale patterns by elective
   adsorption of streptavidin to exposed regions. A low density of aldehyde
   functional groups is produced, and this enables derivatization with
   nitrilotriacetic acid via an amine linker. Complexation with nickel
   enables the site-specific immobilization of histidine-tagged yellow and
   green fluorescent proteins. Nanometer-scale patterns may be fabricated
   using a Lloyd's mirror interferometer, with a sample and mirror set at
   right angles to each other. At low exposures, partial degradation of the
   OEG chains does not remove the protein-resistance of the surface, even
   though friction force microscopy reveals the formation of patterns. At
   an exposure of ca. 18 J cm(-2), the modified regions became adhesive to
   proteins in a narrow region ca. 30 nm (lambda/8) wide. As the exposure
   is increased further the lines quickly broaden to ca. 90 nm. Adjustment
   of the angle between the sample and mirror enables the fabrication of
   lines of His-tagged green fluorescent protein at a period of 340 nm that
   could be resolved using a confocal microscope.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the use of actively controlled electronics to
   maximize the energy harvested from a stationary stochastic disturbance.
   In prior work by the authors, it has been shown that when the harvester
   dynamics are linear and the transmission losses in the electronics are
   resistive, the optimal feedback controller is the solution to a
   nonstandard linear-quadratic-Gaussian optimal control problem. This
   article augments the theory in the following three distinct ways: (a) It
   illustrates how to use linear matrix inequalities to balance the
   objective of energy harvesting against other response control objectives
   (such as minimum requirements on closed-loop damping and maximum levels
   of voltage response), in the synthesis of the optimal feedback law; (b)
   it establishes a more realistic characterization of the transmission
   losses in the actively controlled power electronics used to regulate the
   extraction of power; and (c) it illustrates how the optimal control
   theory for resistive loss models can be extended to accommodate the more
   realistic loss models. The theory is illustrated in the context of a
   piezoelectric energy harvesting model, and an example is used to
   illustrate that the theory can be used to simultaneously optimize the
   feedback law, together with the switching frequency and storage bus
   voltage of the power electronics.}},

Abstract = {{While cochlear implants (CIs) usually provide high levels of speech
   recognition in quiet, speech recognition in noise remains challenging.
   To overcome these difficulties, it is important to understand how
   implanted listeners separate a target signal from interferers. Stream
   segregation has been studied extensively in both normal and electric
   hearing, as a function of place of stimulation. However, the effects of
   pulse rate, independent of place, on the perceptual grouping of
   sequential sounds in electric hearing have not yet been investigated. A
   rhythm detection task was used to measure stream segregation. The
   results of this study suggest that while CI listeners can segregate
   streams based on differences in pulse rate alone, the amount of stream
   segregation observed decreases as the base pulse rate increases. Further
   investigation of the perceptual dimensions encoded by the pulse rate and
   the effect of sequential presentation of different stimulation rates on
   perception could be beneficial for the future development of speech
   processing strategies for CIs. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{A variety of methods exist for inducible control of DNA transcription in
   yeast. These include the use of native yeast promoters or regulatory
   elements that are responsive to small molecules such as galactose,
   methionine, and copper, or engineered systems that allow regulation by
   orthogonal small molecules such as estrogen. While chemically regulated
   systems are easy to use and can yield high levels of protein expression,
   they often provide imprecise control over protein levels. Moreover,
   chemically regulated systems can affect many other proteins and pathways
   in yeast, activating signaling pathways or physiological responses.
   Here, we describe several methods for light mediated control of DNA
   transcription in vivo in yeast. We describe methodology for using a red
   light and phytochrome dependent system to induce transcription of genes
   under GAL1 promoter control, as well as blue light/cryptochrome
   dependent systems to control transcription of genes under GAL1 promoter
   or LexA operator control. Light is dose dependent, inexpensive to apply,
   easily delivered, and does not interfere with cellular pathways, and
   thus has significant advantages over chemical systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Accelerating disorder-order transitions of FePt by preforming a

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{7258-7264}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many approaches had been reported to successfully reduce the transition
   temperature of FePt from Al to L1(0) phase, though without detailed
   knowledge. In this work, we deposited the metastable AgPt layer adjacent
   to the Fe layer and addressed the importance of vacancies in the
   disorder-order transition of FePt at reduced temperatures on the basis
   of a kinetic diffusion model. The decomposition of the metastable AgPt
   phase, creating excess vacancies during the post-deposition annealing
   process, accelerated the intermixing between Fe and Pt and the
   nucleation of L1(0) FePt. The evolution of phase transformation from
   AgPt-Fe to L1(0) FePt-Ag was monitored by in situ high temperature X-ray
   diffractometry and was also validated by first-principles calculations.
   The intermixing between Fe and Pt and the nucleation of L1(0) FePt after
   annealing at 230 degrees C were directly observed by transmission
   electron microscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffractometry,
   respectively. With the assistance of the decomposition of AgPt, we
   obtained a (0 0 1)-dominated L1(0) FePt film with an out-of-plane
   coercivity as large as 13.3 kOe after annealing at a temperature as low
   as 350 degrees C. The principles of the proposed method can be applied
   for versatile disorder-order phase transitions. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia

Title = {{Droplet Microfluidics Platform for Highly Sensitive and Quantitative

Abstract = {{We present an attractive new system for the specific and sensitive
   detection of the malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites. The system relies
   on isothermal conversion of single DNA cleavage ligation events
   catalyzed specifically by the Plasmodium enzyme topoisomerase I to
   micrometer-sized products detectable at the single-molecule level.
   Combined with a droplet microfluidics lab-on-a-chip platform, this
   design allowed for sensitive, specific, and quantitative detection of
   all human-malaria-causing Plasmodium species in single drops of
   unprocessed blood with a detection limit of less than one parasite/mu L.
   Moreover, the setup allowed for detection of Plasmodium parasites in
   noninvasive saliva samples from infected patients. During recent years
   malaria transmission has declined worldwide, and with this the number of
   patients with low-parasite density has increased. Consequently, the need
   for accurate detection of even a few parasites is becoming increasingly
   important for the continued combat against the disease. We believe that
   the presented droplet microfluidics platform, which has a high potential
   for adaptation to point-of-care setups suitable for low-resource
   settings, may contribute significantly to meet this demand. Moreover,
   potential future adaptation of the presented setup for the detection of
   other microorganisms may form the basis for the development of a more
   generic platform for diagnosis, fresh water or food quality control, or
   other purposes within applied or basic science.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a novel buffering technique for increasing the Ascan rate of
   swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) systems employing low
   duty cycle swept source lasers. This technique differs from previously
   reported buffering techniques in that it employs a fast optical switch,
   capable of switching in 60 ns, instead of a fused fiber coupler at the
   end of the buffering stage, and is therefore appreciably more power
   efficient. The use of the switch also eliminates patient exposure to
   light that is not used for imaging that occurs at the end of the laser
   sweep, thereby increasing the system sensitivity. We also describe how
   careful management of polarization can remove undesirable artifacts due
   to polarization mode dispersion. In addition, we demonstrate how
   numerical compensation techniques can be used to modify the signal from
   a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) clock obtained from the original
   sweep to recalibrate the buffered sweep, thereby reducing the complexity
   of systems employing lasers with integrated MZI clocks. Combining these
   methods, we constructed an SSOCT system employing an Axsun technologies
   laser with a sweep rate of 100kHz and 6dB imaging range of 5.5mm. The
   sweep rate was doubled with sweep buffering to 200 kHz, and the imaging
   depth was extended to 9 mm using coherence revival. We demonstrated the
   feasibility of this system by acquiring images of the anterior segments
   and retinas of healthy human volunteers. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Quality standards impose increasingly stringent requirements and
   constraints on quality of service attributes and measures. As a
   consequence, aspects, phenomena, and behaviors, hitherto approximated or
   neglected, have to be taken into account in quantitative assessment in
   order to provide adequate measures satisfying smaller and smaller
   confidence intervals and tolerances. With specific regards to
   reliability and availability, this means that interferences and
   dependencies involving the components of a system can no longer be
   neglected. Therefore, in order to support such a trend, specific
   techniques and tools are required to adequately deal with dynamic
   aspects in reliability and availability assessment.
   The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how state-space based
   techniques can satisfy such a demand. For this purpose some examples of
   specific dynamic reliability behaviors, such as common cause failure and
   load sharing, are considered applying state-space based techniques to
   study the corresponding reliability models. Different repair policies in
   availability contexts are also explored. Both Markovian and
   non-Markovian models are studied via phase type expansion and renewal
   theory in order to adequately represent and evaluate the considered
   dynamic reliability aspects in case of generally distributed lifetimes
   and times to repair. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laccases belong to the group of phenol oxidizes and constitute one of
   the most promising classes of enzymes for future use in various fields.
   For industrial and biotechnological purposes, laccases were among the
   first enzymes providing larger-scale applications such as removal of
   polyphenols or conversion of toxic compounds. The wood-degrading
   basidiomycete Cerrena unicolor C-139, reported in this study, is one of
   the high-laccase producers. In order to facilitate novel and more
   efficient biocatalytic process applications, there is a need for
   laccases with improved biochemical properties, such as thermostability
   or stability in broad ranges of pH. In this work, modifications of
   laccase isoforms by hydrophobization, hydrophilization, and
   polymerization were performed. The hydrophobized and hydrophilized
   enzyme showed enhanced surface activity and higher ranges of pH and
   temperatures in comparison to its native form. However, performed
   modifications did not appear to noticeably alter enzyme's native
   structure possibly due to the formation of coating by particles of
   saccharides around the molecule. Additionally, surface charge of
   modified laccase shifted towards the negative charge for the
   hydrophobized laccase forms. In all tested modifications, the size
   exclusion method led to average 80 \% inhibition removal for
   hydrophilized samples after an hour of incubation with fluoride ions.
   Samples that were hydrophilized with lactose and cellobiose showed an
   additional 90 \% reversibility of inhibition by fluoride ions after an
   hour of concluding the reaction and 40 \% after 24 h. The hydrophobized
   laccase showed higher level of the reversibility after 1 h (above 80 \%)
   and 24 h (above 70 \%) incubation with fluoride ions. The addition of
   ascorbate to laccase solution before a fluoride spike resulted in more
   efficient reversibility of fluoride inhibitory effect in comparison to
   the treatments with reagents used in the reversed sequence.}},

   published September 28, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00182.2012.-In this
   study, we tested the hypotheses that endothelial cells (ECs) derived
   from human umbilical cord blood (hCB-ECs) exhibit low permeability,
   which increases as hCB-ECs age and undergo senescence, and that the
   change in the permeability of hCB-ECs is due to changes in tight
   junction protein localization and the activity of exchange protein
   activated by cAMP (Epac)1. Albumin permeability across low-passage
   hCB-EC monolayers on Transwell membranes was 10 times lower than for
   human aortic ECs (HAECs) (P < 0.01) but similar to in vivo values in
   arteries. Expression of the tight junction protein occludin and tyrosine
   phosphorylation of occludin were less in hCB-ECs than in HAECs (P <
   0.05). More hCB-ECs than HAECs underwent mitosis (P < 0.01). hCB-ECs
   that underwent >44 population doublings since isolation had a
   significantly higher permeability than hCB-ECs that underwent <31
   population doublings (P < 0.05). This age-related increase in hCB-EC
   permeability was associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation
   of occludin (P < 0.01); permeability and occludin phosphorylation were
   reduced by treatment with 2 mu M resveratrol. Tyrosine phosphorylation
   of occludin and cell age influence the permeability of hCB-ECs, whereas
   levels of EC proliferation and expression of tight junction proteins did
   not explain the differences between hCB-EC and HAEC permeability. The
   elevated permeability in late passage hCB-ECs was reduced by 25-40\% by
   elevation of membrane-associated cAMP and activation of the Epac1
   pathway. Given the similarity to in vivo permeability to albumin and the
   high proliferation potential, hCB-ECs may be a suitable in vitro model
   to study transport-related pathologies and cell aging.}},

Journal = {{CORROSION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{502-511}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present in this work a numerical framework for simulating corrosive
   dissolution over long periods of time. Our proposed framework consists
   of three main elements: a novel dilute electrochemical model, a
   projective integration approach for obtaining the motion of the anodic
   front, and an adaptive remeshing scheme. One of the main challenges in
   modeling corrosive dissolution is the vast difference in the time scales
   involved. That is, ionic transport occurs at time scales that are many
   orders of magnitude smaller than the time scale at which the motion of
   dissolving fronts occurs. Based on the disparity of the time scales, we
   postulate that the evolution of the ionic distribution in the
   electrolyte as driven by a changing anodic front can be approximated as
   a sequence of steady states, effectively reducing the problem to a
   single time scale. With this simplification, we are able to use a simple
   explicit time integration scheme for determining the evolution of the
   dissolving anodes. We present demonstrative examples to show the
   capability of the proposed framework to capture complex electrochemical
   behavior in corroding systems when the motion of anodic fronts is
   considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   sensing. Herein is reported the highest sensitivity and figure of merit
   (FOM) microresonator sensor integrated with an EWD system to date {[}FOM
   is the product of the quality (Q) factor and the sensitivity (S)]. The
   EWD system embedded microresonator sensor had a measured FOM of 0: 60 x
   10(6) nm/RIU (Q = 8; 400; S = 72 nm/RIU) in 2-cSt silicone oil and
   water, which is nearly double the best FOM previously reported for an
   microresonator placed on top of an EWD system. Additionally, a nominal
   FOM of 1: 2 x 10(6) nm/RIU (Q = 15 000; S = 82 nm/RIU) was measured for
   the vertically coupled sensor fabricated on a standard SiO2/Si
   substrate. This FOM is the highest reported to date for SU-8
   microresonators probed at wavelengths around 1550 nm. These results
   indicate that high-performance polymer sensors can be integrated with
   low-power-consumption EWD microfluidics sample preparation systems

Abstract = {{Server virtualization is a technology used in many enterprise systems to
   reduce operation and acquisition costs, and increase the availability of
   their critical services. Virtualized systems may be even more complex
   than traditional nonvirtualized systems; thus, the quantitative
   assessment of system availability is even more difficult. In this paper,
   we propose a sensitivity analysis approach to find the parameters that
   deserve more attention for improving the availability of systems. Our
   analysis is based on Markov reward models, and suggests that host
   failure rate is the most important parameter when the measure of
   interest is the system mean time to failure. For capacity oriented
   availability, the failure rate of applications was found to be another
   major concern. The results of both analyses were cross-validated by
   varying each parameter in isolation, and checking the corresponding
   change in the measure of interest. A cost-based optimization method
   helps to highlight the parameter that should have higher priority in
   system enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of microhole arrays in thin Au films is suited for the
   excitation of localized and propagating surface plasmon (SP) modes.
   Conditions can be established to excite a resonance between the
   localized and propagating SP modes, which further enhanced the local
   electromagnetic (EM) field. The co-excitation of localized and
   propagating SP modes depends on the angle of incidence (theta (exc)) and
   refractive index of the solution interrogated. As a consequence of the
   enhanced EM field, enhanced sensitivity and an improved response for
   binding events by about a factor of 3 to 5 was observed with SPR sensors
   in the Kretschmann configuration for a set of experimental conditions
   (lambda (SPR), theta (exc), and eta). Thus, microhole arrays can improve
   sensing applications of SPR based on classical prism-based
   instrumentation and are suited for SP-coupled spectroscopic techniques.}},

   the flow architecture (spacings, shapes) such that the heat transfer
   between the assembly and the ground is increased. The flow configuration
   changes freely, and its design is evolutionary. The better shapes change
   gradually from slender to square as the volume fraction occupied by the
   flow assembly increases. The heat transfer performance increases as the
   depth of the structure decreases, but the depth has a negligible effect
   on the shape of the structure. The results also show that the heat
   transfer performance increases as the configuration of the ground volume
   and the buried structure evolves to the most slender shape possible. (C)

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered constructs designed to treat large cartilage defects
   or osteoarthritic lesions may be exposed to significant mechanical
   loading as well as an inflammatory environment upon implantation in an
   injured or diseased joint. We hypothesized that a three-dimensionally
   (3D) woven poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold seeded with bone
   marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would provide biomimetic
   mechanical properties in early stages of in vitro culture as the MSCs
   assembled a functional, cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM). We
   also hypothesized that these properties would be maintained even in the
   presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is
   found at high levels in injured or diseased joints. MSC-seeded 3D woven
   scaffolds cultured in chondrogenic conditions synthesized a functional
   ECM rich in collagen and proteoglycan content, reaching an aggregate
   modulus of similar to 0.75 MPa within 14 days of culture. However, the
   presence of pathophysiologically relevant levels of IL-1 limited matrix
   accumulation and inhibited any increase in mechanical properties over
   baseline values. On the other hand, the mechanical properties of
   constructs cultured in chondrogenic conditions for 4 weeks prior to IL-1
   exposure were protected from deleterious effects of the cytokine. These
   findings demonstrate that IL-1 significantly inhibits the chondrogenic
   development and maturation of MSC-seeded constructs; however, the
   overall mechanical functionality of the engineered tissue can be
   preserved through the use of a 3D woven scaffold designed to recreate
   the mechanical properties of native articular cartilage. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Galectin-1 (Gal-1), an endogenous beta-galactoside-binding protein,
   binds to laminins, which are highly expressed in the nucleus pulposus
   (NP) of the intervertebral disc (IVD). The objective of this study is to
   evaluate the expression of Gal-1 protein in IVD tissues during aging and
   the effect of Gal-1 on IVD cell adhesion to laminins. Tissues from rat,
   porcine, and human (scoliosis or disc degeneration) IVDs were used to
   evaluate Gal-1 expression via immunostaining, RT-PCR, and Western blot
   analysis. Attachment of isolated IVD cells (porcine and human) on select
   laminin isoforms (LM-111 and LM-511) was compared with/without
   pre-incubation with exogenous Gal-1. A biotinylated Gal-1(B-Gal-1) was
   used to evaluate for binding to IVD cells and to select for IVD cells by
   magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). NP cells expressed high levels
   of Gal-1 protein as compared to anulus fibrosus (AF) cells in immature
   tissues, while exogenous Gal-1 increased both NP and AF cell attachment
   to laminins and exhibited a similar binding to both cell types in vitro.
   With aging, Gal-1 levels in NP tissue appeared to decrease. In addition,
   incubation with B-Gal-1 was able to promote the retention of more than
   50\% of IVD cells via MACS. Our results provide new findings for the
   presence and functional role of Gal-1 within IVDs. Similar staining
   patterns for Gal-1 and LM-511 in IVD tissue suggest that Gal-1 may serve
   as an adhesion molecule to interact with both cells and laminins. This
   MACS protocol may be useful for selecting pure IVD cells from mixed
   cells of pathological tissue. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Abstract = {{Stimuli responsive (or ``smart{''}) polymer brushes represent a
   non-toxic approach for achieving release of biofouling layers.
   Thermo-responsive poly(N-isopro-pylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) polymer brushes
   have been shown to modulate bacterial adhesion and release through
   transition between temperatures above and below the lower critical
   solution temperature (LCST similar to 32 degrees C) of PNIPAAm in water.
   In this article, we describe a convenient method to synthesize grafted
   PNIPAAm brushes over large areas for biological studies using a
   relatively simple and rapid method which allows atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) in presence of air using the activator regenerated
   electron transfer (ARGET) mechanism. PNIPAAm brushes were characterized
   using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion
   mass spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   ellipsometry, and contact angle measurements. Our studies demonstrate
   that uniform, high purity PNIPAAm brushes with controlled and high
   molecular weight can be easily produced over large areas using
   ARGET-ATRP. We also report the use of a spinning disk apparatus to
   systematically and quantitatively study the detachment profiles of
   bacteria from PNIPAAm surfaces under a range (0-400 dyne/cm(2)) of shear
   stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria secrete a variety of public good exoproducts into their
   environment. These exoproducts are typically produced under the control
   of quorum sensing (QS), a signaling mechanism by which bacteria sense
   and respond to changes in their density. QS seems to provide an
   advantageous strategy to regulate these costly but beneficial
   exoproducts: it delays production until sufficiently high cell density,
   when the overall benefit of exoproducts outweighs cost of their
   production. This notion raises several fundamental questions about QS as
   a general control strategy adopted by bacteria. How much delay is
   advantageous? Under what conditions does QS-mediated regulation become
   advantageous? How does this advantage depend on the kinetic properties
   of QS? How robust is a given QS system to the stochastic events that
   occur over bacterial lifecycles? To quantitatively address these
   questions, we engineered a gene circuit in Escherichia coli to control
   the synthesis and secretion of a costly but beneficial exoenzyme. We
   show that exoenzyme production is overall advantageous only if initiated
   at a sufficiently high density. This property sets the potential
   advantage for QS-mediated regulation when the initial density is low and
   the growth cycle is sufficiently long compared with the exoenzyme
   response time. This advantage of QS-mediated regulation is robust to
   varying initial cell densities and growth durations, and it is
   particularly striking when bacteria face uncertainty, such as from
   stochastic dispersal during their lifecycle. We show, however, that, for
   QS to be optimal, its kinetic properties must be appropriately tuned;
   this property has implications for antibacterial treatments that target
   QS.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that fluid flow cloaking solutions, based on active
   hydrodynamic metamaterials, exist for two-dimensional flows past a
   cylinder in a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Re's), up to approximately
   200. Within the framework of the classical Brinkman equation for
   homogenized porous flow, we demonstrate using two different methods that
   such cloaked flows can be dynamically stable for Re's in the range of
   5-119. The first highly efficient method is based on a linearization of
   the Brinkman-Navier-Stokes equation and finding the eigenfrequencies of
   the least stable eigenperturbations; the second method is a direct
   numerical integration in the time domain. We show that, by suppressing
   the von Karman vortex street in the weakly turbulent wake, porous flow
   cloaks can raise the critical Reynolds number up to about 120 or five
   times greater than for a bare uncloaked cylinder.}},

Abstract = {{Near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) spectroscopy is capable of sensitive
   and selective detection of semiconductive, single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWNT) using the unique electronic bandgap properties of these
   carbon allotropes. We reported here the first detection and quantitation
   of SWNT in sediment and biota at environmentally relevant concentrations
   using NIRF spectroscopy. In addition, we utilized this technique to
   qualitatively characterize SWNT samples before and after ecotoxicity,
   bioavailability and fate studies in the aquatic environment. Sample
   preparation prior to NIRF analysis consisted of surfactant-assisted high
   power ultrasonication. The bile salt sodium deoxycholate (SDC) enabled
   efficient extraction and disaggregation of SWNT prior to NIRF analysis.
   The method was validated using standard-addition experiments in two
   types of estuarine sediments, yielding recoveries between 66 +/- 7\% and
   103 +/- 10\% depending on SWNT type and coating used, demonstrating the
   ability to isolate SWNT from complex sediment matrices. Instrument
   detection limits were determined to be 15 ng mL(-1) SWNT in 2\% SDC
   solution and method detection limits (including a concentration step)
   were 62 ng g(-1) for estuarine sediment, and 1.0 mu g L-1 for water. Our
   work has shown that NIRF spectroscopy is highly sensitive and selective
   for SWNT and that this technique can be applied to track the
   environmental and biological fate of this important class of carbon
   nanomaterial in the aquatic environment.}},

Abstract = {{The development of regenerative therapies for cartilage injury has been
   greatly aided by recent advances in stem cell biology. Induced
   pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the potential to provide an abundant
   cell source for tissue engineering, as well as generating
   patient-matched in vitromodels to study genetic and environmental
   factors in cartilage repair and osteoarthritis. However, both cell
   therapy and modeling approaches require a purified and uniformly
   differentiated cell population to predictably recapitulate the
   physiological characteristics of cartilage. Here, iPSCs derived from
   adult mouse fibroblasts were chondrogenically differentiated and
   purified by type II collagen (Col2)-driven green fluorescent protein
   (GFP) expression. Col2 and aggrecan gene expression levels were
   significantly up-regulated in GFP+ cells compared with GFP-cells and
   decreased with monolayer expansion. An in vitro cartilage defect model
   was used to demonstrate integrative repair by GFP+ cells seeded in
   agarose, supporting their potential use in cartilage therapies. In
   chondrogenic pellet culture, cells synthesized cartilage-specific matrix
   as indicated by high levels of glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen
   and low levels of type I and type X collagen. The feasibility of cell
   expansion after initial differentiation was illustrated by homogenous
   matrix deposition in pellets from twice-passaged GFP+ cells. Finally,
   atomic force microscopy analysis showed increased microscale elastic
   moduli associated with collagen alignment at the periphery of pellets,
   mimicking zonal variation in native cartilage. This study demonstrates
   the potential use of iPSCs for cartilage defect repair and for creating
   tissue models of cartilage that can be matched to specific genetic
   backgrounds.}},

Abstract = {{Charge rearrangement by sprites is analyzed for a mesoscale convective
   system (MCS) situated in north Texas and east New Mexico on 15 July
   2010. During the thunderstorm, electric field data were recorded by the
   Langmuir Electric Field Array (LEFA), while magnetic field data were
   recorded by the charge-moment network near Duke University. A high speed
   (12500 fps) video system operated at Langmuir Laboratory recorded
   telescopic images of the sprites. Data from the National Lightning
   Detection Network (NLDN) show that each sprite was preceded by a series
   of cloud discharges and cloud-to-ground discharges. The triggering event
   preceding the sprite was typically a positive cloud-to-ground (+CG)
   stroke. For one out of the 10 sprites that were recorded, there was a
   positive hump in the electric field a few milliseconds after the +CG
   return stroke. The size and shape of the hump roughly matched the light
   intensity emitted from the sprite. The electric field hump is fit by a
   sprite current that originates in the ionosphere and propagates
   downward, producing the same effect as a downward moving positive
   current. The integral under the current hump was 23.9 C when the
   velocity of the current pulse was between 0.25 c and 0.55 c. The large
   sprite current was followed by impulsive electromagnetic radiation which
   has not been previously reported and could be a recoil effect similar to
   what is called a ``K-change{''} when it is observed in a lightning
   flash.}},

Abstract = {{Brachytherapy is a common clinical technique involving implantation of
   sealed radioactive ``seeds{''} within a tumor to selectively irradiate
   the tumor mass while minimizing systemic toxicity. To mitigate the
   disadvantages associated with complex surgical implantation and
   subsequent device removal procedures, we have developed an alternative
   approach using a genetically encoded peptide polymer solution composed
   of a thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) radiolabeled
   with I-131 that self-assembles into radionuclide seeds upon intratumoral
   injection. The formation of these nontoxic and biodegradable polymer
   seeds led to prolonged intratumoral retention (similar to 85\% ID/tumor
   7 days postinjection) of the radionuclide, elicited a tumor growth delay
   in 100\% of the tumors in two human xenografts (FaDu and PC-3), and
   cured more than 67\% of tumor-bearing animals after a single
   administration of labeled ELP. These results suggest that in situ
   self-assembly of biodegradable and injectable radionuclide-containing
   polypeptide seeds could be a promising therapeutic alternative to
   conventional brachytherapy. Cancer Res; 72(22); 5956-65. (C) 2012 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of state-dependent model biases in land surface models
   can highlight model deficiencies, and provide new insights into model
   development. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used
   to estimate the state-dependent biases of a land surface model
   (ORCHIDEE: ORganising Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms). To
   characterize state-dependent biases in ORCHIDEE, we use multi-year flux
   measurements made at 125 eddy covariance sites that cover 7 different
   plant functional types (PFTs) and 5 climate groups. We determine whether
   the state-dependent model biases in five flux variables (H: sensible
   heat, LE: latent heat, NEE: net ecosystem exchange, GPP: gross primary
   productivity and R-eco: ecosystem respiration) are transferable within
   and between three different timescales (diurnal, seasonal-annual and
   interannual), and between sites (categorized by PFTs and climate
   groups). For each flux variable at each site, the spectral decomposition
   method (singular system analysis) was used to reconstruct time series on
   the three different timescales.
   At the site level, we found that the share of state-dependent model
   biases (hereafter called ``error transferability{''}) is larger for
   seasonal-annual and interannual timescales than for the diurnal
   timescale, but little error transferability was found between timescales
   in all flux variables. Thus, performing model evaluations at multiple
   timescales is essential for diagnostics and future development. For all
   PFTs, climate groups and timescale components, the state-dependent model
   biases are found to be transferable between sites within the same PFT
   and climate group, suggesting that specific model developments and
   improvements based on specific eddy covariance sites can be used to
   enhance the model performance at other sites within the same PFT-climate
   group. This also supports the legitimacy of upscaling from the ecosystem
   scale of eddy covariance sites to the regional scale based on the
   similarity of PFT and climate group. However, the transferability of
   state-dependent model biases between PFTs or climate groups is not
   always found on the seasonal-annual and interannual timescales, which is
   contrary to transferability found on the diurnal timescale and the
   original time series. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an
   effective treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).
   The effects of DBS depend strongly on stimulation frequency: high
   frequencies (>90 Hz) improve motor symptoms, while low frequencies (<50
   Hz) are either ineffective or exacerbate symptoms. The neuronal basis
   for these frequency-dependent effects of DBS is unclear. The effects of
   different frequencies of STN-DBS on behavior and single-unit neuronal
   activity in the basal ganglia were studied in the unilateral
   6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rat model of PD. Only high-frequency DBS
   reversed motor symptoms, and the effectiveness of DBS depended strongly
   on stimulation frequency in a manner reminiscent of its clinical effects
   in persons with PD. Quantification of single-unit activity in the globus
   pallidus externa (GPe) and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) revealed
   that high-frequency DBS, but not low-frequency DBS, reduced pathological
   low-frequency oscillations (similar to 9 Hz) and entrained neurons to
   fire at the stimulation frequency. Similarly, the coherence between
   simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons within and across GPe and SNr
   shifted from the pathological low-frequency band to the stimulation
   frequency during high-frequency DBS, but not during low-frequency DBS.
   The changes in firing patterns in basal ganglia neurons were not
   correlated with changes in firing rate. These results indicate that
   high-frequency DBS is more effective than low-frequency DBS, not as a
   result of changes in firing rate, but rather due to its ability to
   replace pathological lowfrequency network oscillations with a
   regularized pattern of neuronal firing.}},

Abstract = {{The pericellular matrix (PCM) is a narrow region that is rich in type VI
   collagen that surrounds each chondrocyte within the extracellular matrix
   (ECM) of articular cartilage. Previous studies have demonstrated that
   the chondrocyte micromechanical environment depends on the relative
   properties of the chondrocyte, its PCM and the ECM. The objective of
   this study was to measure the influence of type VI collagen on
   site-specific micromechanical properties of cartilage in situ by
   combining atomic force microscopy stiffness mapping with
   immunofluorescence imaging of PCM and ECM regions in cryo-sectioned
   tissue samples. This method was used to test the hypotheses that PCM
   biomechanical properties correlate with the presence of type VI collagen
   and are uniform with depth from the articular surface. Control
   experiments verified that immunolabelling did not affect the properties
   of the ECM or PCM. PCM biomechanical properties correlated with the
   presence of type VI collagen, and matrix regions lacking type VI
   collagen immediately adjacent to the PCM exhibited higher elastic moduli
   than regions positive for type VI collagen. PCM elastic moduli were
   similar in all three zones. Our findings provide further support for
   type VI collagen in defining the chondrocyte PCM and contributing to its
   biological and biomechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{The combustion of coal to generate electricity produces about 130
   million tons of coal combustion residues (CCRs) each year in the United
   States; yet their environmental implications are not well constrained.
   This study systematically documents the quality of effluents discharged
   from CCR settling ponds or cooling water at ten sites and the impact on
   associated waterways in North Carolina, compared to a reference lake. We
   measured the concentrations of major and trace elements in over 300
   samples from CCR effluents, surface water from lakes and rivers at
   different downstream and upstream points, and pore water extracted from
   lake sediments. The data show that CCR effluents contain high levels of
   contaminants that in several cases exceed the U.S. EPA guidelines for
   drinking water and ecological effects. This investigation demonstrates
   the quality of receiving waters in North Carolina depends on (1) the
   ratio between effluent flux and freshwater resource volumes and (2)
   recycling of trace elements through adsorption on suspended particles
   and release to deep surface water or pore water in bottom sediments
   during periods of thermal water stratification and anoxic conditions.
   The impact of CCRs is long-term, which influences contaminant
   accumulation and the health of aquatic life in water associated with

Abstract = {{Nanoparticulate metal sulfides such as ZnS are important for the
   speciation of pollutant metals in sediments, wastewater effluent, and
   other sulfidic environments. In these settings, particles of ZnS are
   formed in the presence of natural organic acids such as humic
   substances, proteins and other biomolecules that will interfere with
   cluster growth and aggregation kinetics. Thiol-containing organics such
   as cysteine are capable of adsorbing to clusters and nanoparticles of
   metal sulfides as they precipitate from solution. The thiols induce
   electrostatic repulsive forces at particle interfaces resulting in slow
   aggregation rates. The aim of this work was to investigate how cysteine
   influences the nucleation and growth rate of ZnS during early stages
   (less than one day) of precipitation. Results from time-resolved small
   angle X-ray scattering and dynamic light scattering confirmed that
   cysteine altered the ZnS precipitation process by decreasing aggregation
   rates of polynuclear ZnS clusters (smallest size <1 nm). Furthermore,
   with decreased aggregation between clusters induced by cysteine, the
   growth rates of the nanoclusters appeared to increase. Characterization
   of the precipitation products by Zn extended X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy also indicated that an excess of cysteine relative to ZnS
   resulted in larger subunits compared to mixtures with equimolar
   quantities of cysteine and ZnS. Overall these results provide clues
   toward the mechanism by which natural organic ligands interfere with the
   ZnS precipitation process in sediments and enable nanoscale clusters or
   particles to persist. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional photonic crystal structures are analyzed by a recently
   developed hybrid technique combining the finite-element time-domain
   (FETD) method and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. This
   hybrid FETD/FDTD method uses the discontinuous Galerkin method as
   framework for domain decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first hybrid FETD/FDTD method that allows non-conformal meshes
   between different FETD and FDTD subdomains. It is also highly
   parallelizable. These properties are very suitable for the computation
   of periodic structures with curved surfaces. Numerical examples for the
   computation of the scattering parameters of two-dimensional photonic
   bandgap structures are presented as applications of the hybrid FETD/FDTD
   method. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the
   proposed hybrid method. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to render objects invisible with a cloak that fits all
   objects and sizes is a longstanding goal for optical devices.
   Invisibility devices demonstrated so far typically comprise a rigid
   structure wrapped around an object to which it is fitted. Here we
   demonstrate smart metamaterial cloaking, wherein the metamaterial device
   not only transforms electromagnetic fields to make an object invisible,
   but also acquires its properties automatically from its own elastic
   deformation. The demonstrated device is a ground-plane microwave cloak
   composed of an elastic metamaterial with a broad operational band (10-12
   GHz) and nearly lossless electromagnetic properties. The metamaterial is
   uniform, or perfectly periodic, in its undeformed state and acquires the
   necessary gradient-index profile, mimicking a quasi-conformal
   transformation, naturally from a boundary load. This easy-to-fabricate
   hybrid elasto-electromagnetic metamaterial opens the door to
   implementations of a variety of transformation optics devices based on
   quasi-conformal maps.}},

Abstract = {{We used a probe-based dual-modality optical imaging instrument to
   measure in vivo coating thickness distributions of a gel distributed
   along the vaginal lumen, in a clinical study. The gel was a surrogate
   for one delivering an anti-HIV topical microbicide. Imaging data from
   Fourier-domain multiplexed low-coherence interferometry (mLCI) and
   fluorimetric measurements were compared to assess the feasibility and
   accuracy of mLCI in measuring in vivo gel coating thickness
   distributions. In each study session, 3.5 mL of Replens gel was inserted
   to the vaginal fornix while the participant was supine. The participant
   either: 1. remained supine (10 or 60 min); or 2. sat up (1 min), stood
   up (1 min), sat down (1 min) and returned to the supine position; net
   elapsed time was 10 or 60 min after which the gel distribution was
   imaged. Local coating thickness distributions were qualitatively and
   quantitatively similar. Here mLCI did not accurately measure thicker gel
   coatings (>0.8 mm), a limitation not seen with fluorimetry. However,
   mLCI is capable of measuring in vivo microbicide gel distributions with
   resolution on the order of 10 mu m, without the need for exogenous
   contrast agents, and can accurately capture relevant summary coating
   measures in good agreement with fluorimetry. (c) 2012 Society of

Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1803-1812}},

Abstract = {{For the past two decades, the Volterra series reduced-order modeling
   approach has been successfully used for the purpose of flutter
   prediction, aeroelastic control design, and aeroelastic design
   optimization. The approach has been less successful, however, when
   applied to other important aeroelastic phenomena, such as
   aerodynamically induced limit-cycle oscillations. Similar to the Taylor
   series, the Volterra series is a polynomial-based approach capable of
   progressively approximating nonlinear behavior using quadratic, cubic,
   and higher-order functional expansions. Unlike the Taylor series,
   however, kernels of the Volterra series are multidimensional convolution
   integrals that are computationally expensive to identify. Thus, even
   though it is well known that aerodynamic nonlinearities are poorly
   approximated by quadratic Volterra series models, cubic and higher-order
   Volterra series truncations cannot be identified because their
   identification costs are too high. In this paper, a novel, sparse
   representation of the Volterra series is explored for which the
   identification costs are significantly lower than the identification
   costs of the full Volterra series. It is demonstrated that sparse
   Volterra reduced-order models are capable of efficiently modeling
   aerodynamically induced limit-cycle oscillations of the prototypical
   NACA 0012 benchmark model. These results demonstrate for the first time
   that Volterra series models are capable of modeling aerodynamically
   induced limit-cycle oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a method for computing the uncertainty in output
   metrics of stochastic models due to epistemic uncertainties in the
   model-input parameters. The method is illustrated by applying it to
   compute the distribution and confidence interval of the reliability of
   the Remote Exploration and Experimentation system. This method makes use
   of Monte Carlo sampling and propagates the epistemic uncertainty in the
   model parameters through the system reliability model. It acts as a
   wrapper to already-existing models as well as their solution
   tools/techniques and has a wide range of applicability. Although it is a
   sampling-based method, no simulation is carried out when performing
   uncertainty propagation through analytic models, but analytic or
   analytic numeric solution of the underlying stochastic model is
   performed for each set of input-parameter values, sampled from their
   distributions. Using the input epistemic uncertainty, in the form of
   95\% confidence intervals of input parameters of the stochastic model,
   the two-sided 95\% confidence interval of reliability of the Remote
   Exploration and Experimentation system at a time t = 5 years is computed

   topical microbicide}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {{36-42}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Drug delivery of topical microbicidal molecules against HIV offers
   promise as a modality to prevent sexual transmission of the virus.
   Success of any microbicide product depends, in an interactive way, upon
   its drug (the microbicide active pharmaceutical ingredient, API) and its
   delivery system (e.g. a gel, film or intravaginal ring). There is a
   widespread agreement that more effective drug delivery vehicles, as well
   as better APIs, must be developed to improve the efficacy of microbicide
   products. Non-Newtonian gels are primary microbicide vehicles, but those
   to date have been created with limited understanding of how their
   properties govern their spreading and retention in the vagina, which, in
   turn, govern successful drug delivery. Here, we apply fundamental fluid
   mechanical and physicochemical transport theory to help better
   understand how successful microbicide API delivery depends upon
   properties of a gel and the vaginal environment. We address several
   critical components of this complex process, including:
   elastohydrodynamic flow of the bolus of a non-Newtonian fluid; and mass
   transfer due to inhomogeneous dilution of the gel by vaginal fluid
   contacting it along a moving boundary (the locally deforming vaginal
   epithelial surface). Local dilution of gel alters local rheological
   properties. We evaluated this experimentally, delin-eating the way that
   constitutive parameters of a shear-thinning gel are modified by
   dilution. We supplement the Reynolds lubrication equation with a mass
   conservation equation to model diluting fluid movement across the moving
   vaginal epithelial surface and into the gel bolus. This is a
   physicochemically complex phenomenon that is not well understood. We
   implement a boundary flux model based upon the elevated hydrodynamic
   pressures in the cells. Results show that this model produces fluxes
   that lie within the range of mean values that have been reported.
   Further experimental characterization of the vaginal wall is required
   for a more precise set of parameters and a more sophisticated
   theoretical treatment of epithelium. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Programmed death is often associated with a bacterial stress response.
   This behavior appears paradoxical, as it offers no benefit to the
   individual. This paradox can be explained if the death is `altruistic':
   the killing of some cells can benefit the survivors through release of
   `public goods'. However, the conditions where bacterial programmed death
   becomes advantageous have not been unambiguously demonstrated
   experimentally. Here, we determined such conditions by engineering
   tunable, stress-induced altruistic death in the bacterium Escherichia
   coli. Using a mathematical model, we predicted the existence of an
   optimal programmed death rate that maximizes population growth under
   stress. We further predicted that altruistic death could generate the
   `Eagle effect', a counter-intuitive phenomenon where bacteria appear to
   grow better when treated with higher antibiotic concentrations. In
   support of these modeling insights, we experimentally demonstrated both
   the optimality in programmed death rate and the Eagle effect using our
   engineered system. Our findings fill a critical conceptual gap in the
   analysis of the evolution of bacterial programmed death, and have
   implications for a design of antibiotic treatment.}},

Title = {{Effects of protocol and obesity on dose conversion factors in adult body
   CT}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In computed tomography (CT), organ dose, effective dose, and
   risk index can be estimated from volume-weighted CT dose index (CTDIvol)
   or dose-length product (DLP) using conversion coefficients. Studies have
   investigated how these coefficients vary across scanner models, scan
   parameters, and patient size. However, their variability across CT
   protocols has not been systematically studied. Furthermore, earlier
   studies of the effect of patient size have not included obese
   individuals, which currently represent more than one-third of U. S.
   adults. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of protocol
   and obesity on dose and risk conversion coefficients in adult body CT.
   Methods: Whole-body computational phantoms were created from clinical CT
   images of six adult patients (three males, three females), representing
   normal-weight patients and patients of three obesity classes. Body CT
   protocols at our institution were selected and categorized into ten
   examination categories based on anatomical region examined. A validated
   Monte Carlo program was used to estimate organ dose. Organ dose
   estimates were normalized by CTDIvol and size-specific dose estimate
   (SSDE) to obtain organ dose conversion coefficients (denoted as h and
   h(ss) factors, respectively). Assuming each phantom to be 20, 40, and 60
   years old, effective dose and risk index were calculated and normalized
   by DLP to obtain effective dose and risk index conversion coefficients
   (denoted as k and q factors, respectively). Coefficient of variation was
   used to quantify the variability of each conversion coefficient across
   examination categories. The effect of obesity was assessed by comparing
   each obese phantom with the normal-weight phantom of the same gender.
   Results: For a given organ, the variability of h factor across
   examination categories that encompassed the entire organ volume was
   generally within 15\%. However, k factor varied more across examination
   categories (15\%-27\%). For all three ages, the variability of q factor
   was small for male (<10\%), but large for female phantoms (21\%-43\%).
   Relative to the normal-weight phantoms, the reduction in h factor (an
   average across fully encompassed organs) was 17\%-42\%, 17\%-40\%, and
   51\%-63\% for obese-class-I, obese-class-II, and obese-class-III
   phantoms, respectively. hss factor was not independent of patient
   diameter and generally decreased with increasing obesity. Relative to
   the normal-weight phantoms, the reduction in k factor was 12\%-40\%,
   14\%-46\%, and 44\%-59\% for obese-class-I, obese-class-II, and
   obese-class-III phantoms, respectively. The respective reduction in q
   factor was 11\%-36\%, 17\%-42\%, and 48\%-59\% at 20 years of age and
   similar at other ages.
   Conclusions: In adult body CT, dose to an organ fully encompassed by the
   primary radiation beam can be estimated from CTDIvol using a
   protocol-independent conversion coefficient. However, fully encompassed
   organs only account for 50\% +/- 19\% of k factor and 46\% +/- 24\% of q
   factor. Dose received by partially encompassed organs is also
   substantial. To estimate effective dose and risk index from DLP, it is
   necessary to use conversion coefficients specific to the anatomical
   region examined. Obesity has a significant effect on dose and risk
   conversion coefficients, which cannot be predicted using body diameter
   alone. SSDE-normalized organ dose is not independent of diameter. SSDE
   itself generally overestimates organ dose for obese patients. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Purpose: The potential health risks associated with low levels of
   ionizing radiation have created a movement in the radiology community to
   optimize computed tomography (CT) imaging protocols to use the lowest
   radiation dose possible without compromising the diagnostic usefulness
   of the images. Despite efforts to use appropriate and consistent
   radiation doses, studies suggest that a great deal of variability in
   radiation dose exists both within and between institutions for CT
   imaging. In this context, the authors have developed an automated
   size-specific radiation dose monitoring program for CT and used this
   program to assess variability in size-adjusted effective dose from CT
   imaging.
   Methods: The authors radiation dose monitoring program operates on an
   independent health insurance portability and accountability act
   compliant dosimetry server. Digital imaging and communication in
   medicine routing software is used to isolate dose report screen captures
   and scout images for all incoming CT studies. Effective dose conversion
   factors (k-factors) are determined based on the protocol and optical
   character recognition is used to extract the CT dose index and
   dose-length product. The patient's thickness is obtained by applying an
   adaptive thresholding algorithm to the scout images and is used to
   calculate the size-adjusted effective dose (EDadj). The radiation dose
   monitoring program was used to collect data on 6351 CT studies from
   three scanner models (GE Lightspeed Pro 16, GE Lightspeed VCT, and GE
   Definition CT750 HD) and two institutions over a one-month period and to
   analyze the variability in EDadj between scanner models and across
   institutions.
   Results: No significant difference was found between computer
   measurements of patient thickness and observer measurements (p = 0.17),
   and the average difference between the two methods was less than 4\%.
   Applying the size correction resulted in EDadj that differed by up to
   44\% from effective dose estimates that were not adjusted by patient
   size. Additionally, considerable differences were noted in EDadj
   distributions between scanners, with scanners employing iterative
   reconstruction exhibiting significantly lower EDadj (range: 9\%-64\%).
   Finally, a significant difference (up to 59\%) in EDadj distributions
   was observed between institutions, indicating the potential for dose
   reduction.
   Conclusions: The authors developed a robust automated size-specific
   radiation dose monitoring program for CT. Using this program,
   significant differences in EDadj were observed between scanner models
   and across institutions. This new dose monitoring program offers a
   unique tool for improving quality assurance and standardization both
   within and across institutions. (C) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{Gold nanostars offer unique plasmon properties that efficiently
   transduce photon energy into heat for photothermal therapy. Nanostars,
   with their small core size and multiple long thin branches, exhibit high
   absorption cross-sections that are tunable in the near-infrared region
   with relatively low scattering effect, making them efficient
   photothermal transducers. Here, we demonstrate particle tracking and
   photothermal ablation both in vitro and in vivo. Using SKBR3 breast
   cancer cells incubated with bare nanostars, we observed photothermal
   ablation within 5 minutes of irradiation (980-nm continuous-wave laser,
   15 W/cm(2)). On a mouse injected systemically with PEGylated nanostars
   for 2 days, extravasation of nanostars was observed and localized
   photothermal ablation was demonstrated on a dorsal window chamber within
   10 minutes of irradiation (785-nm continuous-wave laser, 1.1 W/cm(2)).

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to examine the feasibility of using
   glucose oxidase (GOx) dispersed in a silica matrix for glucose
   monitoring in whole blood, and then to assess whether the flexibility of
   silica sol-gel chemistry could be exploited to enhance glucose sensor
   performance and stability. Silica-dispersed GOx was deployed on
   platinized platinum (Pt) wire to form a Clark-type amperometric glucose
   sensor. Sensors were calibrated using buffered glucose standard
   solutions, and then tested against glucose spiked human serum and whole
   blood. All serum and whole blood measurements met the minimum FDA
   requirement of falling within the ``A+B region{''} of a Clark Error
   Grid. To our knowledge this is the first report of using
   silica-dispersed GOx to measure glucose in whole blood. The effect of
   condensation pH on sensor performance was assessed by dispersing GOx in
   silica condensed at pH 3, 7, and 12, and then testing the sensor
   response against glucose calibration standards. The pH 12 silica sensors
   had statistically faster response time, and higher sensor sensitivity
   compared to pH 7, pH 3 silica and glutaraldehyde crosslinked sensors.
   Membranes of the pH 12 silica had statistically higher glucose diffusion
   coefficient than did the pH 7 and 3 sensors. GOx dispersed in pH 12
   silica also had the longest half life. We hypothesize that the gel-like
   pH 12 silica gels provided reduced barriers to glucose diffusion, and
   the more aqueous microenvironment provided greater stability for the
   enzyme. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A spatial superposition design is presented that couples the
   fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for
   Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) with the National Center of
   Excellence (NCE) lumped urban thermal model for application to the city
   of Phoenix, Arizona. This technique utilizes an approach similar to
   Reynolds decomposition from turbulence theory. The presented
   decomposition takes the NCE model prediction from a mitigated strategy
   as the mean temperature and the difference between the NCE and MM5
   predictions without mitigation strategy as the perturbed temperature.
   The goal of this coupled model is to provide spatial variability when
   simulating mitigation strategies for the urban heat island effect, as
   compared with the spatially invariant lumped model. A validation
   analysis was performed incorporating a maximum 35\% change from the
   baseline albedo value for the urban environment. It is shown that the
   coupled model differs by up to 0.39 degrees C with comparable average
   surface temperature predictions from MM5. The coupled model was also
   used to perform analysis of three different albedo-driven spatial
   mitigation schemes. This resulted in the identification that having a
   lesser number of mitigated points on a square urban grid in Phoenix with
   the same average albedo leads to a greater reduction in average hourly
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the feasibility, efficiency, and system
   design of a hybrid solar system generating electric power for stationary
   applications such as residential buildings. The system is fed by
   methanol and combines methanol steam reforming and proton exchange
   membrane (PEM) fuel cells with solar collectors to generate the required
   heat for the steam reforming. The synergies of these technologies lead
   to a highly efficient system with significantly larger power densities
   compared to conventional systems and generate tremendous advantages in
   terms of installation and operation costs. The present investigation
   describes the entire proposed system and its components and presents
   first analytical, numerical, and experimental results of a larger
   project to prove the feasibility of such a system by analyzing first a
   bench test demonstrator generating around 10 W of electric power and
   finally a prototype for an entire single-family household. It is shown
   that the methanol-to-electricity efficiency of the entire system is
   above 50\%. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007356]}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the Seidel wavefront aberrations and spot sizes of gradient
   index (GRIN) singlet lenses with Delta n approximate to 1. We consider
   and compare curved and planar GRIN lenses with F-numbers of 5 and 1
   against equivalent refractive lenses. We find that the planar GRIN
   lenses generally have larger spot sizes compared to their refractive
   lens equivalents at wide angles. This appears to be due to an inability
   to correct for coma by adjusting the refractive index gradient alone. We
   can correct for the coma by bending the GRIN lens. This results in a
   singlet lens with performance close to but not exceeding that of the
   equivalent refractive lens. We also examine the impact of anisotropy on
   the planar GRIN lenses. We find that fabricating the planar GRIN lenses
   from a uniaxial medium has the potential to improve the performance of
   the lenses. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{It is now well established that both thunderclouds and lightning
   routinely emit x-rays and gamma-rays. These emissions appear over wide
   timescales, ranging from sub-microsecond bursts of x-rays associated
   with lightning leaders, to sub-millisecond bursts of gamma-rays seen in
   space called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, to minute long glows from
   thunderclouds seen on the ground and in or near the cloud by aircraft
   and balloons. In particular, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), which
   are thought to be emitted by thunderclouds, are so bright that they
   sometimes saturate detectors on spacecraft hundreds of kilometers away.
   These TGFs also generate energetic secondary electrons and positrons
   that are detected by spacecraft in the inner magnetosphere. It is
   generally believed that these x-ray and gamma-ray emissions are
   generated, via bremsstrahlung, by energetic runaway electrons that are
   accelerated by electric fields in the atmosphere. In this paper, we
   review this newly emerging field of High-Energy Atmospheric Physics,
   including the production of runaway electrons, the production and
   propagation of energetic radiation, and the effects of both on
   atmospheric electrodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe the histologic development of the human central
   retina from fetal week (Fwk) 22 to 13 years.
   DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series.
   METHODS: Retinal layers and neuronal substructures were delineated on
   foveal sections of fixed tissue stained in azure II-methylene blue and
   on frozen sections immunolabeled for cone, rod, or glial proteins.
   Postmortem tissue was from 11 eyes at Fwk 20-27; 8 eyes at Fwk 28-37; 6
   eyes at postnatal 1 day to 6 weeks; 3 eyes at 9 to 15 months; and 5 eyes
   at 28 months to 13 years.
   RESULTS: At Fwk 20-22 the fovea could be identified by the presence of a
   single layer of cones in the outer nuclear layer. Immunolabeling
   detected synaptic proteins, cone and rod opsins, and Muller glial
   processes separating the photoreceptors. The foveal pit appeared at Fwk
   25, involving progressive peripheral displacement of ganglion cell,
   inner plexiform, and inner nuclear layers. The pit became wider and
   shallower after birth, and appeared mature by 15 months. Between Fwk 25
   and Fwk 38, all photoreceptors developed more distinct inner and outer
   segments, but these were longer on peripheral than foveal cones. After
   birth the foveal outer nuclear layer became much thicker as cone packing
   occurred. Cone packing and neuronal migration during pit formation
   combined to form long central photoreceptor axons, which changed the
   outer plexiform layer from a thin sheet of synaptic pedicles into the
   thickest layer in the central retina by 15 months. Foveal inner and
   outer segment length matched peripheral cones by 15 months and was 4
   times longer by 13 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data are necessary to understand the marked changes
   in human retina from late gestation to early adulthood. They provide
   qualitative and quantitative morphologic information required to
   interpret the changes in hyper- and hyporeflexive bands in pediatric
   spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images at the same ages.

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the goal of nanoparticle-based chemotherapy has been to
   decrease normal tissue toxicity by improving drug specificity to tumors.
   The enhanced permeability and retention effect can permit passive
   accumulation into tumor interstitium. However, suboptimal delivery is
   achieved with most nanoparticles because of heterogeneities of vascular
   permeability, which limits nanoparticle penetration. Furthermore, slow
   drug release limits bioavailability. We developed a fast drug-releasing
   liposome triggered by local heat that has already shown substantial
   antitumor efficacy and is in human trials. Here, we show that thermally
   sensitive liposomes (Dox-TSL) release doxorubicin inside the tumor
   vasculature. Real-time confocal imaging of doxorubicin delivery to
   murine tumors in window chambers and histologic analysis of flank tumors
   illustrates that intravascular drug release increases free drug in the
   interstitial space. This increases both the time that tumor cells are
   exposed to maximum drug levels and the drug penetration distance,
   compared with free drug or traditional pegylated liposomes. These
   improvements in drug bioavailability establish a new paradigm in drug
   delivery: rapidly triggered drug release in the tumor bloodstream.

Abstract = {{Aims Reentrant activity in the heart is often correlated with
   heterogeneity in both the intracellular structure and the interstitial
   structure surrounding cells; however, the combined effect of cardiac
   microstructure and interstitial resistivity in regions of source-load
   mismatch is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate
   how microstructural variations in cell arrangement and increased
   interstitial resistivity influence the spatial distribution of
   conduction delays and block in poorly coupled regions of tissue.
   Methods and results Two-dimensional 0.6 cm x 0.6 cm computer models with
   idealized and realistic cellular structure were used to represent a
   monolayer of ventricular myocytes. Gap junction connections were
   distributed around the periphery of each cell at 10 m intervals. Regions
   of source-load mismatch were added to the models by increasing the gap
   junction and interstitial resistivity in one-half of the tissue.
   Heterogeneity in cell shape and cell arrangement along the boundary
   between well-coupled and poorly coupled tissue increased variability in
   longitudinal conduction delays to as much as 10 ms before the onset of
   conduction block, resulting in wavefront breakthroughs with pronounced
   curvature at distinct points along the boundary. Increasing the
   effective interstitial resistivity reduced source-load mismatch at the
   transition boundary, which caused a decrease in longitudinal conduction
   delay and an increase in the number of wavefront breakthroughs.
   Conclusion Microstructural variations in cardiac tissue facilitate the
   formation of isolated sites of wavefront breakthrough that may enable
   abnormal electrical activity in small regions of diseased tissue to
   develop into more widespread reentrant activity.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To demonstrate the utility of genetically engineered excitable
   cells for studies of basic electrophysiology and cardiac cell therapy.
   Methods and results `Zig-zag' networks of neonatal rat ventricular
   myocytes (NRVMs) were micropatterned onto thin elastomeric films to
   mimic the slow action potential (AP) conduction found in fibrotic
   myocardium. Addition of genetically engineered excitable human embryonic
   kidney cells (HEK-293 cells) ('Ex-293' cells stably expressing Kir2.1,
   Na(v)1.5, and Cx43 channels) increased both cardiac conduction velocity
   by 370 and twitch force amplitude by 64. Furthermore, we stably
   expressed mutant Na(v)1.5 {[}A1924T (fast sodium channel mutant
   (substitution of alanine by threonine at amino acid 1924)] channels with
   hyperpolarized steady-state activation and showed that, despite a 71.6
   reduction in peak I-Na, these cells propagated APs at the same velocity
   as the wild-type Na(v)1.5-expressing Ex-293 cells. Stable expression of
   Ca(v)3.3 (T-type voltage-gated calcium) channels in Ex-293 cells (to
   generate an `ExCa-293' line) significantly increased their AP duration
   and reduced repolarization gradients in cocultures of these cells and
   NRVMs. Additional expression of an optogenetic construct {[}ChIEF
   (light-gated Channelrhodopsin mutant)]enabled light-based control of AP
   firing in ExCa-293 cells.
   Conclusion We show that, despite being non-contractile, genetically
   engineered excitable cells can significantly improve both electrical and
   mechanical function of engineered cardiac tissues in vitro. We further
   demonstrate the utility of engineered cells for tissue-level studies of
   basic electrophysiology and cardiac channelopathies. In the future, this
   novel platform could be utilized in the high-throughput design of new
   genetically encoded indicators of cell electrical function, validation,
   and improvement of computer models of AP conduction, and development of
   novel engineered somatic cell therapies for the treatment of cardiac
   infarction and arrhythmias.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: The EMS Swiss LithoBreaker is a new, portable,
   electrokinetic lithotripter. We compared its tip velocity and
   displacement characteristics with a handheld, pneumatic lithotripter LMA
   StoneBreaker.(TM) We also evaluated fragmentation efficiency using in
   vitro models of percutaneous and ureteroscopic stone fragmentation.
   Materials and Methods: Displacement and velocity profiles were measured
   for 1-mm and 2-mm probes using a laser beam aimed at a photo detector.
   For the percutaneous model, 2-mm probes fragmented 10-mm spherical
   BegoStone phantoms until the fragments passed through a 4-mm mesh sieve.
   The ureteroscopic model used 1-mm probes and compared the pneumatic and
   electrokinetic devices to a 200-lm holmium laser fiber. Cylindrical
   (4-mm diameter, 4-mm length) BegoStone phantoms were placed into
   silicone tubing to simulate the ureter; fragmented stones passed through
   a narrowing in the tubing.
   Results: For both 1-mm and 2-mm probes, the electrokinetic device had
   significantly higher tip displacement and slower tip velocity, P < 0.01.
   In the percutaneous model, the electrokinetic device needed an average
   of 484 impulses over 430 seconds to fragment one BegoStone, while the
   pneumatic device needed 29 impulses over 122 seconds to fragment one
   stone. Both clearance times and number of impulses needed for
   percutaneous stone clearance were significantly different at P < 0.01.
   Ureteroscopically, the mean clearance time was 97 seconds for the
   electrokinetic lithotripter, 145 seconds for the pneumatic lithotripter,
   and 304 seconds for the laser. Comparing the pneumatic device with the
   electrokinetic device ureteroscopically, there was no significant
   difference in clearance time, P = 0.55. Both the pneumatic and
   electrokinetic lithotripters, however, demonstrated decreased clearance
   times compared with the laser, P = 0.027.
   Conclusions: The portable electrokinetic lithotripter may be better
   suited for ureteroscopy instead of percutaneous nephrolithotomy. It
   appears to be comparable to the portable pneumatic device in the ureter.
   Further clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings in vivo.}},

   Automated systems for acquiring and analyzing real-time images are

   thaliana seedlings can be grown and their roots imaged by confocal
   microscopy over several days without manual intervention. To achieve
   high throughput, we decoupled acquisition from analysis. In the
   acquisition phase, we obtain images at low resolution and segment to
   identify regions of interest. Coordinates are communicated to the
   microscope to record the regions of interest at high resolution. In the
   analysis phase, we reconstruct three-dimensional objects from stitched
   high-resolution images and extract quantitative measurements from a
   virtual medial section of the root. We tracked hundreds of roots to

Abstract = {{Long-lived nuclear spin states could greatly enhance the applicability
   of hyperpolarized nuclear magnetic resonance. Using singlet states
   between inequivalent spin pairs has been shown to extend the signal
   lifetime by more than an order of magnitude compared to the spin lattice
   relaxation time (T-1), but they have to be prevented from evolving into
   other states. In the most interesting case the singlet is between
   chemically equivalent spins, as it can then be inherently an eigenstate.
   However this presents major challenges in the conversion from bulk
   magnetization to singlet. In the only case demonstrated so far, a
   reversible chemical reaction to break symmetry was required. Here we
   present a pulse sequence technique that interconverts between singlet
   spin order and bulk magnetization without breaking the symmetry of the
   spin system. This technique is independent of field strength and is
   applicable to a broad range of molecules.}},

   velocity {[}refractive index (RI) less than unity] and/or magnetic
   response. We introduce a new approximation applicable to certain device
   geometries in the eikonal limit: piecewise-uniform scaling of the RI.
   This transformation preserves the ray trajectories but leads to a
   uniform phase delay. We show how to take advantage of phase delays to
   achieve a limited (directional and wavelength-dependent) form of
   invisibility that does not require loss-ridden (meta) materials with

   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Ge 3d core level spectra for
   as-deposited films showed stable levels of Ge2O, GeO, and Ge2O3 with air
   exposure duration, while growth of GeO2 was observed with logarithmic
   rate dependence, characteristic of low temperature oxide growth on fully
   dense Ge films. In contrast, chlorinated PGe showed an initially reduced
   surface and growth of all GeOx phases for up to 10 h of air exposure,
   after which only GeO2 was observed to grow with similar kinetics to that
   observed on the as-deposited films. Deconvolution of the XPS Cl 2p core
   level spectra showed continual loss of chlorine for up to similar to 10
   h of air exposure after which no Cl-Ge components could be resolved. The
   results reported herein reveal logarithmic growth of each of the GeOx
   phases on chlorinated PGe during displacement of chlorine with oxygen.
   Once chlorine is removed from the surface, the percentages of Ge2O, GeO,
   and Ge2O3 suboxides remain constant with only GeO2 growth with further
   air exposure. These results offer insight into the early stages of oxide
   growth on porous germanium indicating the formation of a suboxide
   transition layer onto which GeO2 grows. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Objective: In order to assess the effect of gray matter volumes and
   cortical thickness on antidepressant treatment response in late-life
   depression, the authors examined the relationship between brain regions
   identified a priori and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale
   (MADRS) scores over the course of an antidepressant treatment trial.
   Method: In a nonrandomized prospective trial, 168 patients who were at
   least 60 years of age and met DSM-IV criteria for major depression
   underwent MRI and were enrolled in a 12-week treatment study. Exclusion
   criteria included cognitive impairment or severe medical disorders. The
   volumes or cortical thicknesses of regions of interest that differed
   between the depressed group and a comparison group (N=50) were
   determined. These regions of interest were used in analyses of the
   depressed group to predict antidepressant treatment outcome. Mixed-model
   analyses adjusting for age, education, age at depression onset, race,
   baseline MADRS score, scanner, and interaction with time examined
   predictors of MADRS scores over time.
   Results: Smaller hippocampal volumes predicted a slower response to
   treatment. With the inclusion of white matter hyperintensity severity
   and neuropsychological factor scores, the best model included
   hippocampal volume and cognitive processing speed to predict rate of
   response over time. A secondary analysis showed that hippocampal volume
   and frontal pole thickness differed between patients who achieved
   remission and those who did not.
   Conclusions: These data expand our understanding of the prediction of
   treatment course in late-life depression. The authors propose that the
   primary variables of hippocampal volume and cognitive processing speed,
   subsuming other contributing variables (episodic memory, executive
   function, language processing) predict antidepressant response.}},

Title = {{Intracardiac acoustic radiation force impulse imaging: A novel imaging
   method for intraprocedural evaluation of radiofrequency ablation lesions}},
Journal = {{HEART RHYTHM}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Arrhythmia recurrence after cardiac radiofrequency ablation
   (RFA) for atrial fibrillation has been linked to conduction through
   discontinuous lesion lines. Intraprocedural visualization and corrective
   ablation of lesion line discontinuities could decrease postprocedure
   atrial fibrillation recurrence. Intracardiac acoustic radiation force
   impulse (ARFI) imaging is a new imaging technique that visualizes RFA
   lesions by mapping the relative elasticity contrast between
   compliant-unablated and stiff RFA-treated myocardium.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether intraprocedure ARFI images can identify
   RFA-treated myocardium in vivo.
   METHODS In 8 canines, an electroanatomical mapping-guided intracardiac
   echo catheter was used to acquire 2-dimensional ARFI images along right
   atrial ablation lines before and after RFA. ARFI images were acquired
   during diastole with the myocardium positioned at the ARFI focus (1.5
   cm) and parallel to the intracardiac echo transducer for maximal and
   uniform energy delivery to the tissue. Three reviewers categorized each
   ARFI image as depicting no lesion, noncontiguous lesion, or contiguous
   lesion. For comparison, 3 separate reviewers confirmed RFA lesion
   presence and contiguity on the basis of functional conduction block at
   the imaging plane location on electroanatomical activation maps.
   RESULTS Ten percent of ARFI images were discarded because of motion
   artifacts. Reviewers of the ARFI images detected RFA-treated sites with
   high sensitivity (95.7\%) and specificity (91.5\%). Reviewer
   identification of contiguous lesions had 75.3\% specificity and 47.1\%
   sensitivity.
   CONCLUSIONS Intracardiac ARFI imaging was successful in identifying
   endocardial RFA treatment when specific imaging conditions were
   maintained. Further advances in ARFI imaging technology would facilitate
   a wider range of imaging opportunities for clinical lesion evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in digital microfluidics have led to the promise of
   miniaturized laboratories, with the associated advantages of high
   sensitivity and less human-induced errors. Front-end operations such as
   sample preparation play a pivotal role in biochemical laboratories, and
   in applications in biomedical engineering and life science. For fast and
   high-throughput biochemical applications, preparing samples of multiple
   target concentrations sequentially is inefficient and time-consuming.
   Therefore, it is critical to concurrently prepare samples of multiple
   target concentrations. In addition, since reagents used in biochemical
   reactions are expensive, reagent-saving has become an important
   consideration in sample preparation. Prior work in this area does not
   address the problem of reagent-saving and concurrent sample preparation
   for multiple target concentrations. In this paper, we propose the first
   reagent-saving mixing algorithm for biochemical samples of multiple
   target concentrations. The proposed algorithm not only minimizes the
   consumption of reagents, but it also reduces the number of waste
   droplets and the sample preparation time by preparing the target
   concentrations concurrently. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both
   real biochemical experiments and synthetic test cases to demonstrate its
   effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to prior work, the proposed
   algorithm can achieve up to 41\% reduction in the number of reagent
   droplets and waste droplets, and up to 50\% reduction in sample
   preparation time.}},

Abstract = {{In order to provide high performance with low power consumption, many
   multicore chips employ dynamic voltage scaling and voltage islands that
   operate at multiple power-supply voltage levels. Effective defect
   screening for such chips requires test applications at different
   operating voltages, which leads to higher test time and test cost
   compared to systems-on-a-chip (SoCs), which operate at only a single
   voltage level. We propose test scheduling techniques to minimize the
   testing time for multicore chips when each core is tested at multiple
   voltage levels and when it is tested for state retention when the core
   switches between two voltage levels. The proposed techniques include
   exact optimization based on integer linear programming and fast
   heuristic methods. Experimental results for two test-case SoCs from the
   industry highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The scaling laws of the vertical (F (wc) ) and longitudinal (F (uc) )
   velocity-scalar cospectra within the inertial subrange are explored
   using dimensional arguments and a simplified cospectral budget in the
   canopy sublayer above three distinct forested ecosystems. The cospectral
   budget was shown to be consistent with plausible scaling laws
   originating from dimensional considerations. Using the analytical
   solution to the novel cospectral budget, it was shown that F (wc) (k)
   and F (uc) (k) are governed by the linear superposition of two terms
   that scale as k (-2/3-alpha) and k (-beta) , where k is the wavenumber,
   -alpha is the exponent of the velocity spectrum, and beta( a parts per
   thousand yen 7/3) depends on the ratio of the similarity constants for
   the pressure-scalar covariance and the flux transport terms. It was also
   demonstrated that, when the magnitude of the mean scalar concentration
   gradient is large, the k (-2/3-alpha) term dominates the velocity-scalar
   cospectral budget. For such a case, correcting for biases emerging from
   high frequency losses in eddy-covariance scalar flux measurements can be
   readily formulated by using the measured velocity spectral exponent in
   the inertial subrange.}},

Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{A spectral element approach is introduced to determine the Floquet
   exponents (FEs) of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) stabilized by
   extended delayed feedback control (EDFC). The spectral approach does not
   require solving time-dependent eigenproblems that existing methods
   require. Instead, the spectral approach determines the stability of the
   delay differential equations of the system by numerical approximation.
   The method is capable of analyzing systems whose UPOs arise from
   bifurcations other than period-doubling. Results are presented for
   stabilizing UPOs in Duffing systems. The FEs calculated by the spectral
   approach are compared to published results for two examples. In both
   cases, the spectral method results agree well with those determined by
   previous methods. In addition, the spectral method was used to analyze a
   high-dimensional, asymmetrical system with a UPO in chaos arising from
   tori doubling following a Hopf bifurcation.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical investigation was conducted upon the steric interaction
   between a spherical particle and a flat plate. The effects of curvature
   on both the segment density distribution of polymer and on the steric
   interaction energy between a particle and a plate were examined. It was
   found that the conventional approach using Derjaguin approximation may
   overestimate the interaction energy, especially for very small
   particles. Based on the results obtained from applying the
   Flory-Krigbaum theory with the accurate geometry change during the
   interaction, simple approximate expressions of exponential form were
   proposed for both the osmotic (mixing) and elastic contributions to the
   steric interaction energy for a sphere-plate interaction. The proposed
   model was validated against a set of experimental results from a
   reported study employing atomic force microscopy. Also investigated was
   the steric interaction between a spherical particle coated with polymer
   and an uncoated flat surface. It was found that the steric interaction
   energy from the osmotic contribution is significantly higher than that
   from the elastic contribution and that steric interaction is
   considerably weaker when the polymer exists on only one of the
   interacting surfaces.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Here, we show that a plate heated by a moving beam can be cooled
   effectively by fluid that flows through a vasculature of channels
   embedded in the plate. The vascular designs studied are radial, grid and
   hybrid (radial + grid). The peak temperature of the plate changes with
   the path and direction of the moving beam. The strength, size and speed
   of the beam vary. The peak temperature increases as the beam strength
   and size increase and as the speed of the beam decreases. The grid and
   hybrid designs are robust because of loops present in the flow
   structure. The pressure difference that drives the fluid flow varied.
   The channel diameter ratios that provide greatest flow access are
   reported. The cooling performance of the multiscale grid structures is
   less sensitive to the changes in beam path than the cooling performance
   of the other structures studied. The effect of adding a vascular
   structure to the design is dramatic. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{In the past, a number of attempts have failed to robustly compute highly
   transient shock hydrodynamics flows on tetrahedral meshes. To a certain
   degree, this is not a surprise, as prior attempts emphasized enhancing
   the structure of shock-capturing operators rather than focusing on
   issues of stability with respect to small, linear perturbations. In this
   work, a new method is devised to stabilize computations on
   piecewise-linear tetrahedral finite elements. Spurious linear modes are
   prevented by means of the variational multiscale approach. The resulting
   algorithm can be proven stable in the linearized limit of acoustic wave
   propagation. Starting from this solid base, the approach is generalized
   to fully nonlinear shock computations, by augmenting the discrete
   formulation with discontinuity-capturing artificial viscosities.
   Extensive tests in the case of Lagrangian shock dynamics of ideas gases
   on triangular and tetrahedral grids confirm the stability and accuracy
   properties of the method. Incidentally, the same tests also reveal the
   lack of stability of current compatible/mimetic/staggered
   discretizations: This is due to the presence of specific unstable modes
   which are theoretically analyzed and verified in computations. Published

Abstract = {{We investigate various strategies to enforce the kinematics at an
   embedded interface for transient problems within the extended finite
   element method. In particular, we focus on explicit time integration of
   the semi-discrete equations of motion and extend both dual and primal
   variational frameworks for constraint enforcement to a transient regime.
   We reiterate the incompatibility of the dual formulation with purely
   explicit time integration and the severe restrictions placed by the
   CourantFriedrichsLevy condition on primal formulations. We propose an
   alternate, consistent formulation for the primal method and derive an
   estimate for the stabilization parameter, which is more amenable in an
   explicit dynamics framework. Importantly, the use of the new estimate
   circumvents the need for any tolerances as an interface approaches an
   element boundary. We also show that with interfacial constraints,
   existing mass lumping schemes can lead to prohibitively small critical
   time steps. Accordingly, we propose a mass lumping procedure, which
   provides a more favorable estimate. These techniques are then
   demonstrated on several benchmark numerical examples, where we compare
   and contrast the accuracy of the primal methods against the dual methods
   in enforcing the constraints. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and
   morbidity for children in the United States. The unavailability of
   pediatric cadavers makes it difficult to study and characterize the
   mechanical behavior of the pediatric skull. Computer based finite
   element modeling could provide valuable insights, but the utility of
   these models depends upon the accuracy of cranial material property
   inputs.
   In this study, 47 samples from one six year-old human cranium were
   tested to failure via four point bending to study the effects of strain
   rate and the structure of skull bone on modulus of elasticity and
   failure properties for both cranial bone and suture. The results show
   that strain rate does not have a statistically meaningful effect on the
   mechanical properties of the six year-old skull over the range of strain
   rates studied (average low rate of 0.045 s(-1), average medium rate of
   0.44 s(-1), and an average high rate of 2.2 s(-1)), but that these
   properties do depend on the growth patterns and morphology of the skull.
   The thickness of the bone was found to vary with structure. The bending
   stiffness (per unit width) for tri-layer bone (12.32 +/- 5.18 Nm(2)/m)
   was significantly higher than that of cortical bone and sutures (5.58
   +/- 1.46 Nm(2)/m and 3.70 +/- 1.88 Nm(2)/m respectively). The modulus of
   elasticity was 9.87 +/- 1.24 GPa for cranial cortical bone and 1.10 +/-
   0.53 GPa for sutures. The effective elastic modulus of tri-layer bone
   was 3.69 +/- 0.92 GPa. Accurate models of the pediatric skull should
   account for the differences amongst these three distinct tissues in the
   six year-old skull. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the roles of lithotripter shock wave (LSW) parameters and
   cavitation in stone comminution, a series of in vitro fragmentation
   experiments have been conducted in water and 1,3-butanediol (a
   cavitation-suppressive fluid) at a variety of acoustic field positions
   of an electromagnetic shock wave lithotripter. Using field mapping data
   and integrated parameters averaged over a circular stone holder area
   (R-h=7 mm), close logarithmic correlations between the average peak
   pressure (P+(avg)) incident on the stone (D=10 mm BegoStone) and
   comminution efficiency after 500 and 1000 shocks have been identified.
   Moreover, the correlations have demonstrated distinctive thresholds in
   P+(avg) (5.3 MPa and 7.6 MPa for soft and hard stones, respectively),
   that are required to initiate stone fragmentation independent of
   surrounding fluid medium and LSW dose. These observations, should they
   be confirmed using other shock wave lithotripters, may provide an
   important field parameter (i.e., P+(avg)) to guide appropriate
   application of SWL in clinics, and facilitate device comparison and

Abstract = {{Artificial sensation via electrical or optical stimulation of brain
   sensory areas offers a promising treatment for sensory deficits. For a
   brain-machine-brain interface, such artificial sensation conveys
   feedback signals from a sensorized prosthetic limb. The ways neural
   tissue can be stimulated to evoke artificial sensation and the parameter
   space of such stimulation, however, remain largely unexplored. Here we
   investigated whether stochastic facilitation (SF) could enhance an
   artificial tactile sensation produced by intracortical microstimulation
   (ICMS). Two rhesus monkeys learned to use a virtual hand, which they
   moved with a joystick, to explore virtual objects on a computer screen.
   They sought an object associated with a particular artificial texture
   (AT) signaled by a periodic ICMS pattern delivered to the primary
   somatosensory cortex (S1) through a pair of implanted electrodes. During
   each behavioral trial, aperiodic ICMS (i.e., noise) of randomly chosen
   amplitude was delivered to S1 through another electrode pair implanted 1
   mm away from the site of AT delivery. Whereas high-amplitude noise
   worsened AT detection, moderate noise clearly improved the detection of
   weak signals, significantly raising the proportion of correct trials.
   These findings suggest that SF could be used to enhance prosthetic
   sensation.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of flow direction methods against field observations of
   overland flow dispersion}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{The D8, D8-LTD, D infinity-LTD, D infinity, MD infinity, and MD8 flow
   direction methods are evaluated against field observations of overland
   flow dispersion obtained from novel experimental methods. Thin flows of
   cold water were released at selected points on a warmer slope and
   individual overland flow patterns originating from each of these points
   were observed using a terrestrial laser scanner and a thermal imaging
   camera. Land microtopography was determined by using laser returns from
   the dry land surface, whereas overland flow patterns were determined by
   using either laser returns or infrared emissions from the wetted
   portions of the land surface. Planar overland flow dispersion is found
   to play an important role in the region lying immediately downslope of
   the point source, but attenuates rapidly as flow propagates downslope.
   In contrast, existing dispersive flow direction methods are found to
   provide a continued dispersion with distance downslope. Predicted
   propagation patterns, for all methods considered here, depend critically
   on the size h of grid cells involved. All methods are found to be poorly
   sensitive in extremely fine grids (h <= 2 cm), and to be poorly specific
   in coarse grids (h 2 m). Satisfactory results are, however, obtained in
   grids having resolutions h that approach the average flow width (50 cm),
   with the best performances displayed by the MD8 method in the finest
   grids (5 <= h <= 20 cm), and by the MD infinity, D infinity, and D
   infinity-LTD methods in the coarsest grids (20 cm < h <= 1 m).}},

Abstract = {{Advanced gene regulatory systems are necessary for scientific research,
   synthetic biology, and gene-based medicine. An ideal system would allow
   facile spatiotemporal manipulation of gene expression within a cell
   population that is tunable, reversible, repeatable, and can be targeted
   to diverse DNA sequences. To meet these criteria, a gene regulation
   system was engineered that combines light-sensitive proteins and
   programmable zinc finger transcription factors. This system,
   light-inducible transcription using engineered zinc finger proteins
   (LITEZ), uses two light-inducible dimerizing proteins from Arabidopsis
   thaliana, GIGANTEA and the LOV domain of FKF1, to control synthetic zinc
   finger transcription factor activity in human cells. Activation of gene
   expression in human cells engineered with LITEZ was reversible and
   repeatable by modulating the duration of illumination. The level of gene
   expression could also be controlled by modulating light intensity.
   Finally, gene expression could be activated in a spatially defined
   pattern by illuminating the human cell culture through a photomask of
   arbitrary geometry. LITEZ enables new approaches for precisely
   regulating gene expression in biotechnology and medicine, as well as
   studying gene function, cell-cell interactions, and tissue
   morphogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional interpretation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing
   and imaging data, total surface coverage of adsorbed or deposited
   chemical and biological molecules is generally assumed. This homogenous
   assumption leads to the modeling of monomodal propagation of plasmons on
   the surface of the metallic film corresponding to a certain relative
   permittivity and thickness of the medium-such as molecular thin
   film-next to the metal. In actual SPR Imaging (SPRI) and SPR sensing
   situations, the plasmonics-active platforms (e. g., biochips) employed
   may capture the biomolecular targets as aggregates of different domain
   sizes on the surface of the thin metallic films. Indeed, such binding of
   target material always has a finite thickness and is characterized by
   aggregate lateral sizes possibly varying from tens of nanometers to
   hundreds of micrometers. This paper studies the propagation of surface
   plasmons in metallic films, with dielectric domain sizes varying within
   such ranges. Through rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) calculations,
   it is indicated that when the domain size is small, only a single mode
   of propagation-i.e. `monomodal' propagation behavior-occurs as indicated
   by only one dip in the angular reflectance curves associated with
   metallic film having a periodically structured array of molecules on its
   surface. On the other hand, as the domain size is increased, there is a
   transition from the `monomodal propagation behavior' to the existence of
   a `mixture of monomodal and bimodal propagation behavior', which changes
   to a purely `bimodal behavior' after the size of the domain periodicity
   is increased beyond about ten micron. Such a transition pathway clearly
   exhibits isobestic points. The calculations presented in this paper can
   enable correct interpretation of experimental angular or spectral
   reflectance data. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a digital neural/EMG telemetry system small enough
   and lightweight enough to permit recording from insects in flight. It
   has a measured flight package mass of only 38 mg. This system includes a
   single-chip telemetry integrated circuit (IC) employing RF power
   harvesting for battery-free operation, with communication via modulated
   backscatter in the UHF (902-928 MHz) band. An on-chip 11-bit ADC
   digitizes 10 neural channels with a sampling rate of 26.1 kSps and 4 EMG
   channels at 1.63 kSps, and telemeters this data wirelessly to a base
   station. The companion base station transceiver includes an RF
   transmitter of +36 dBm (4 W) output power to wirelessly power the
   telemetry IC, and a digital receiver with a sensitivity of -70 dBm for
   10(-5) BER at 5.0Mbps to receive the data stream from the telemetry IC.
   The telemetry chip was fabricated in a commercial 0.35 mu m 4M1P (4
   metal, 1 poly) CMOS process. The die measures 2.36 X 1.88 mm, is 250 mu

Title = {{Bursting drops in solid dielectrics caused by high voltages}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fluid drops tend to be spheres-a shape that minimizes surface energy. In
   thunderstorm clouds, drops can become unstable and emit thin jets when
   charged beyond certain limits. The instability of electrified drops in
   gases and liquids has been widely studied and used in applications
   including ink-jet printing, electrospinning nanofibers, microfluidics
   and electrospray ionization. Here we report a different scenario: drops
   in solids become unstable and burst under sufficiently high electric
   fields. We find the instability of drops in solids morphologically
   resembles that in liquids, but the critical electric field for the
   instability follows a different scaling due to elasticity of solids. Our
   observations and theoretical models not only advance the fundamental
   understanding of electrified drops, but also suggest a new failure
   mechanism of high energy density dielectric polymers, which have diverse
   applications ranging from capacitors for power grids and electric
   vehicles to muscle-like transducers for soft robots and energy
   harvesting.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: The ancient mind and body healing methods of yoga recently
   sparked fervor in the scientific community as an alternative and
   complementary means of therapy. Since the World Health Organization
   officially began promoting yoga in developing countries in 1978, yoga
   has been cited for its therapeutic potential and has been widely
   recognized in Western culture. However, as an increasing number of
   people practice yoga for remedial purposes, researchers raise two
   important questions: 1) Is yoga a valid complementary management and
   rehabilitation treatment modality 2) What conditions show promise of
   treatment with this intervention. Objective: This review article uses
   comprehensive scientific, evidence-based studies to analyze the efficacy
   of various basic and applied aspects of yoga in disease prevention and
   health promotion. It specifically intends to expose the effects of yoga
   in neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy, stroke, multiple
   sclerosis, Alzheimers disease, peripheral nervous system disease, and
   fibromyalgia. Materials and Methods: Information was gathered from
   various resources including PubMed, Ovid, MD-Consult, USC, and U.C.L.A.
   libraries. Studies were selected and reviewed on the basis of sample
   size, control, randomization, double-blinding, and statistical analysis
   of results. Results: The pratice of yoga and meditation demonstrates
   statistically encouraging physiological and psychological improvements
   in the aforementioned neurological disorders. However, there were
   certain flaws and inadequacies in the study designs employed to evaluate
   the same. A critical analysis of these studies is presented.
   Conclusions: With the aim to focus attention on this widespread yet
   largely unexamined treatment modality, this paper seeks to provide
   direction and support for further research necessary to validate yoga as
   an integrative, alternative, and complementary therapy.}},

Title = {{Fundamentals of transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation dose:
   Definition, selection, and reporting practices}},
Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{435-453}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The growing use of transcranial electric and magnetic (EM) brain
   stimulation in basic research and in clinical applications necessitates
   a clear understanding of what constitutes the dose of EM stimulation and
   how it should be reported.
   Methods
   This paper provides fundamental definitions and principles for reporting
   of dose that encompass any transcranial EM brain stimulation protocol.
   Results
   The biologic effects of EM stimulation are mediated through an
   electromagnetic field injected (via electric stimulation) or induced
   (via magnetic stimulation) in the body. Therefore, transcranial EM
   stimulation dose ought to be defined by all parameters of the
   stimulation device that affect the electromagnetic field generated in
   the body, including the stimulation electrode or coil configuration
   parameters: shape, size, position, and electrical properties, as well as
   the electrode or coil current (or voltage) waveform parameters: pulse
   shape, amplitude, width, polarity, and repetition frequency; duration of
   and interval between bursts or trains of pulses; total number of pulses;
   and interval between stimulation sessions and total number of sessions.
   Knowledge of the electromagnetic field generated in the body may not be
   sufficient but is necessary to understand the biologic effects of EM
   stimulation.
   Conclusions
   We believe that reporting of EM stimulation dose should be guided by the
   principle of reproducibility: sufficient information about the
   stimulation parameters should be provided so that the dose can be
   replicated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A major goal of biological research is to provide a mechanistic
   understanding of diverse biological processes. To this end, synthetic
   biology offers a powerful approach, whereby biological questions can be
   addressed in a well-defined framework. By constructing simple gene
   circuits, such studies have generated new insights into the design
   principles of gene regulatory networks. Recently, this strategy has been
   applied to analyze ecological and evolutionary questions, where
   population-level interactions are critical. Here, we highlight recent
   development of such systems and discuss how they were used to address
   problems in ecology and evolutionary biology. As illustrated by these
   examples, synthetic ecosystems provide a unique platform to study
   ecological and evolutionary phenomena that are challenging to study in
   their natural contexts.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Military service members are often exposed to at least one
   explosive event, and many blast-exposed veterans present with symptoms
   of traumatic brain injury. However, there is little information on the
   intensity and duration of blast necessary to cause brain injury.
   METHODS: Varying intensity shock tube blasts were focused on the head of
   anesthetized ferrets, whose thorax and abdomen were protected. Injury
   evaluations included physiologic consequences, gross necropsy, and
   histologic diagnosis. The resulting apnea, meningeal bleeding, and
   fatality were analyzed using logistic regressions to determine injury
   risk functions.
   RESULTS: Increasing severity of blast exposure demonstrated increasing
   apnea immediately after the blast. Gross necropsy revealed hemorrhages,
   frequently near the brain stem, at the highest blast intensities. Apnea,
   bleeding, and fatality risk functions from blast exposure to the head
   were determined for peak overpressure and positive-phase duration. The
   50\% risk of apnea and moderate hemorrhage were similar, whereas the
   50\% risk of mild hemorrhage was independent of duration and required
   lower overpressures (144 kPa). Another fatality risk function was
   determined with existing data for scaled positive-phase durations from 1
   millisecond to 20 milliseconds.
   CONCLUSION: The first primary blast brain injury risk assessments for
   mild and moderate/severe injuries in a gyrencephalic animal model were
   determined. The blast level needed to cause a mild/moderate brain injury
   may be similar to or less than that needed for pulmonary injury. The
   risk functions can be used in future research for blast brain injury by
   providing realistic injury risks to guide the design of protection or
   evaluate injury. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2012;73:895-901. Copyright

Abstract = {{Picoliter droplets actuated on an electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD)
   actuator are demonstrated. In this study, the physical scaling of
   electrodes for 33 mu m and 21 mu m EWD devices resulted in droplets of
   12 pl and 5 pl being dispensed respectively in conjunction with 3 mu m
   SU8 gaskets. The stacked multi-layer insulators in the actuators
   consisted of 200 nm tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) and 200 nm parylene C
   films deposited and coated with 70 nm of CYTOP. The voltages for
   dispensing droplets on chips without any external pressure sources are
   17.1 V-rms and 22 V-rms for these two sets of devices. A 12 pl droplet
   can be split into two 6 pl daughter droplets at 18.7 V-rms with 33 mu m
   electrode devices. Droplet manipulation is also demonstrated with
   paramagnetic beads and buffer solutions with proteins. In addition,
   electrodes with interlocking protrusions and special featured reservoir
   gasket are designed to facilitate droplet dispensing on these scaled EWD
   devices. In order to improve sealing of the two-piece sandwich EWD
   structure, a soft material, Norland Optical Adhesive (NOA), was coated
   on the top plate along with pressure on top. We demonstrate that based
   on fundamental theories and experiments, the dimensional scaling of EWD
   devices has not yet met a limitation as long as the EWD device can be
   sealed well. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The inoculum effect (IE) refers to the decreasing efficacy of an
   antibiotic with increasing bacterial density. It represents a unique
   strategy of antibiotic tolerance and it can complicate design of
   effective antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections. To gain insight
   into this phenomenon, we have analyzed responses of a lab strain of
   Escherichia coli to antibiotics that target the ribosome. We show that
   the IE can be explained by bistable inhibition of bacterial growth. A
   critical requirement for this bistability is sufficiently fast
   degradation of ribosomes, which can result from antibiotic-induced
   heat-shock response. Furthermore, antibiotics that elicit the IE can
   lead to `band-pass' response of bacterial growth to periodic antibiotic
   treatment: the treatment efficacy drastically diminishes at intermediate
   frequencies of treatment. Our proposed mechanism for the IE may be
   generally applicable to other bacterial species treated with antibiotics
   targeting the ribosomes. Molecular Systems Biology 8: 617; published

   boundary layer}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the atmospheric surface layer, modifications to the logarithmic mean
   velocity and air temperature profiles induced by thermal stratification
   or convection are accounted for via stability correction functions
   phi(m) and phi(h), respectively, that vary with the stability parameter
   zeta. These two stability correction functions are presumed to be
   universal in shape and independent of the surface characteristics. To
   date, there is no phenomenological theory that explains all the scaling
   laws in phi(h) with zeta, how phi(h) relates to phi(m), and why phi(h)
   <= phi(m) is consistently reported. To develop such a theory, the
   recently proposed links between the mean velocity profile and the
   Kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence, which were previously modified to
   account for the effects of buoyancy, are generalized here to include the
   mean air temperature profile. The resulting theory explains the observed
   scaling laws in phi(m) and phi(h) reported in many field and numerical
   experiments, predicts their behaviors across a wide range of atmospheric
   stability conditions, and elucidates why heat is transported more
   efficiently than momentum in certain stability regimes. In particular,
   it is shown that the enhancement in heat transport under unstable
   conditions is linked to a ``scale-resonance{''} between turnover eddies
   and excursions in the instantaneous air temperature profiles. Excluding
   this scale-resonance results in the conventional Reynolds analogy with
   phi(m) = phi(h) across all stability conditions. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{One of the primary limitations of cell therapy for myocardial infarction
   is the low survival of transplanted cells, with a loss of up to 80\% of
   cells within 3 days of delivery. The aims of this study were to
   investigate the distribution of nutrients and oxygen in infarcted
   myocardium and to quantify how macromolecular transport properties might
   affect cell survival. Transmural myocardial infarction was created by
   controlled cryoablation in pigs. At 30 days post-infarction, oxygen and
   metabolite levels were measured in the peripheral skeletal muscle,
   normal myocardium, the infarct border zone, and the infarct interior.
   The diffusion coefficients of fluorescein or FITC-labeled dextran
   (0.3-70 kD) were measured in these tissues using fluorescence recovery
   after photobleaching. The vascular density was measured via endogenous
   alkaline phosphatase staining. To examine the influence of these infarct
   conditions on cells therapeutically used in vivo, skeletal myoblast
   survival and differentiation were studied in vitro under the oxygen and
   glucose concentrations measured in the infarct tissue. Glucose and
   oxygen concentrations, along with vascular density were significantly
   reduced in infarct when compared to the uninjured myocardium and infarct
   border zone, although the degree of decrease differed. The diffusivity
   of molecules smaller than 40 kD was significantly higher in infarct
   center and border zone as compared to uninjured heart. Skeletal myoblast
   differentiation and survival were decreased stepwise from control to
   hypoxia, starvation, and ischemia conditions. Although oxygen, glucose,
   and vascular density were significantly reduced in infarcted myocardium,
   the rate of macromolecular diffusion was significantly increased,
   suggesting that diffusive transport may not be inhibited in infarct
   tissue, and thus the supply of nutrients to transplanted cells may be
   possible. in vitro studies mimicking infarct conditions suggest that
   increasing nutrients available to transplanted cells may significantly
   increase their ability to survive in infarct. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007455]}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To quantitatively compare noise texture across computed
   tomography (CT) scanners from different manufacturers using the noise
   power spectrum (NPS).
   Methods: The American College of Radiology CT accreditation phantom
   (Gammex 464, Gammex, Inc., Middleton, WI) was imaged on two scanners:
   Discovery CT 750HD (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), and SOMATOM Definition
   Flash (Siemens Healthcare, Germany), using a consistent acquisition
   protocol (120 kVp, 0.625/0.6 mm slice thickness, 250 mAs, and 22 cm
   field of view). Images were reconstructed using filtered backprojection
   and a wide selection of reconstruction kernels. For each image set, the
   2D NPS were estimated from the uniform section of the phantom. The 2D
   spectra were normalized by their integral value, radially averaged, and
   filtered by the human visual response function. A systematic
   kernel-by-kernel comparison across manufacturers was performed by
   computing the root mean square difference (RMSD) and the peak frequency
   difference (PFD) between the NPS from different kernels. GE and Siemens
   kernels were compared and kernel pairs that minimized the RMSD and
   vertical bar PFD vertical bar were identified.
   Results: The RMSD (vertical bar PFD vertical bar) values between the NPS
   of GE and Siemens kernels varied from 0.01 mm(2) (0.002 mm(-1)) to 0.29
   mm(2) (0.74 mm(-1)). The GE kernels ``Soft,{''} ``Standard,{''}
   ``Chest,{''} and ``Lung{''} closely matched the Siemens kernels
   ``B35f,{''} ``B43f,{''} ``B41f,{''} and ``B80f (RMSD < 0.05 mm(2),
   vertical bar PFD vertical bar < 0.02 mm(-1), respectively). The GE
   ``Bone,{''} ``Bone+,{''} and ``Edge{''} kernels all matched most closely
   with Siemens ``B75f{''} kernel but with sizeable RMSD and vertical bar
   PFD vertical bar values up to 0.18 mm(2) and 0.41 mm(-1), respectively.
   These sizeable RMSD and vertical bar PFD vertical bar values
   corresponded to visually perceivable differences in the noise texture of
   the images.
   Conclusions: It is possible to use the NPS to quantitatively compare
   noise texture across CT systems. The degree to which similar texture
   across scanners could be achieved varies and is limited by the kernels
   available on each scanner. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists

Title = {{Estimation of the two-dimensional presampled modulation transfer
   function of digital radiography devices using one-dimensional test
   objects}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The modulation transfer function (MTF) of medical imaging
   devices is commonly reported in the form of orthogonal one-dimensional
   (1D) measurements made near the vertical and horizontal axes with a slit
   or edge test device. A more complete description is found by measuring
   the two-dimensional (2D) MTF. Some 2D test devices have been proposed,
   but there are some issues associated with their use: (1) they are not
   generally available; (2) they may require many images; (3) the results
   may have diminished accuracy; and (4) their implementation may be
   particularly cumbersome. This current work proposes the application of
   commonly available 1D test devices for practical and accurate estimation
   of the 2D presampled MTF of digital imaging systems.
   Methods: Theory was developed and applied to ensure adequate fine
   sampling of the system line spread function for 1D test devices at
   orientations other than approximately vertical and horizontal. Methods
   were also derived and tested for slit nonuniformity correction at
   arbitrary angle. Techniques were validated with experimental
   measurements at ten angles using an edge test object and three angles
   using a slit test device on an indirect-detection flat-panel system
   {[}GE Revolution XQ/i (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI)]. The 2D MTF was
   estimated through a simple surface fit with interpolation based on
   Delaunay triangulation of the ID edge-based MTF measurements. Validation
   by synthesis was also performed with simulated images from a
   hypothetical direct-detection flat-panel device.
   Results: The 2D MTF derived from physical measurements yielded an
   average relative precision error of 0.26\% for frequencies below the
   cutoff (2.5 mm(-1)) and approximate circular symmetry at frequencies
   below 4 mm(-1). While slit analysis generally agreed with the results of
   edge analysis, the two showed subtle differences at frequencies above 4
   mm(-1). Slit measurement near 45 degrees revealed radial asymmetry in
   the MTF resulting from the square pixel aperture (0.2 mm x 0.2 mm), a
   characteristic which was not necessarily appreciated with the orthogonal
   1D MTF measurements. In simulation experiments, both slit- and
   edge-based measurements resolved the radial asymmetries in the 2D MTF.
   The average absolute relative accuracy error in the 2D MTF between the
   DC and cutoff (2.5 mm(-1)) frequencies was 0.13\% with average relative
   precision error of 0.11\%. Other simulation results were similar to
   those derived from physical data.
   Conclusions: Overall, the general availability, acceptance, accuracy,
   and ease of implementation of ID test devices for MTF assessment make
   this a valuable technique for 2D MTF estimation. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Polymeric substrates intended for cell culture and tissue engineering
   are often surface-modified to facilitate cell attachment of most
   anchorage-dependent cell types. The modification alters the surface
   chemistry and possibly topography. However, scant attention has been
   paid to other surface property alterations. In studying oxygen plasma
   treatment of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), we show that oxygen plasma
   treatment alters the surface chemistry and, consequently, the topography
   and elasticity of PDMS at the nanoscale level. The elasticity factor has
   the predominant effect, compared with the chemical and topographical
   factors, on cell adhesions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The
   enhanced focal adhesions favor cell spreading and osteogenesis of hMSCs.
   Given the prevalent use of PDMS in biomedical device construction and
   cell culture experiments, this study highlights the importance of
   understanding how oxygen plasma treatment would impact subsequent cell
   substrate interactions. It helps explain inconsistency in the literature
   and guides preparation of PDMS-based biomedical devices in the future.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a plasmon nanoruler using a coupled film nanoparticle
   (film-NP) format that is well-suited for investigating the sensitivity
   extremes of plasmonic coupling. Beaus it is relatively straightforward
   to functionalize bulk surface plasmon supporting films, such as gold, we
   are able to precisely control plasmonic gap dimensions by creating
   ultrathin molecular spacer layers on the gold films, on top of which we
   immobilize plasmon resonant nanoparticles (NPs). Each immobilized NP
   becomes coupled to the underlying film and functions as a plasmon
   nanoruler, exhibiting a distance-dependent resonance red shift in its
   peak plasmon wavelength as it approaches the film. Due to the uniformity
   of response from the film-NPs to separation distance, we are able to use
   extinction and scattering measurements from ensembles of film-NPs to
   characterize the coupling effect over a series of very short separation
   distances-ranging from 5 to 20 angstrom-and combine these measurements
   with similar data from larger separation distances extending out to 27
   nm. We find that the film-NP plasmon nanoruler is extremely sensitive at
   very short film-NP separation distances, yielding spectral shifts as
   large as 5 nm for every 1 angstrom change in separation distance. The
   film-NP coupling at extremely small spacings is so uniform and reliable
   that we are able to usefully probe gap dimensions where the classical
   Drude model of the conducting electrons in the metals is no longer
   descriptive; for gap sizes smaller than a few nanometers, either quantum
   or semiclassical models of the carrier response must be employed to
   predict the observed wavelength shifts. We find that, despite the
   limitations, large field enhancements and extreme sensitivity persist
   down to even the smallest gap sizes.}},

   2144-2159, 2012. First published July 18, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00204.2012.-Our percept of visual stability across
   saccadic eye movements may be mediated by presaccadic remapping. Just
   before a saccade, neurons that remap become visually responsive at a
   future field (FF), which anticipates the saccade vector. Hence, the
   neurons use corollary discharge of saccades. Many of the neurons also
   decrease their response at the receptive field (RF). Presaccadic
   remapping occurs in several brain areas including the frontal eye field
   (FEF), which receives corollary discharge of saccades in its layer IV
   from a collicular-thalamic pathway. We studied, at two levels, the
   microcircuitry of remapping in the FEF. At the laminar level, we
   compared remapping between layers IV and V. At the cellular level, we
   compared remapping between different neuron types of layer IV. In the
   FEF in four monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we identified 27 layer IV neurons
   with orthodromic stimulation and 57 layer V neurons with antidromic
   stimulation from the superior colliculus. With the use of established
   criteria, we classified the layer IV neurons as putative excitatory (n =
   11), putative inhibitory (n = 12), or ambiguous (n = 4). We found that
   just before a saccade, putative excitatory neurons increased their
   visual response at the RF, putative inhibitory neurons showed no change,
   and ambiguous neurons increased their visual response at the FF. None of
   the neurons showed presaccadic visual changes at both RF and FF. In
   contrast, neurons in layer V showed full remapping (at both the RF and
   FF). Our data suggest that elemental signals for remapping are
   distributed across neuron types in early cortical processing and
   combined in later stages of cortical microcircuitry.}},

Abstract = {{A method for estimating model parameters based on chaotic system
   response data is described. This estimation problem is made challenging
   by sensitive dependence to initial conditions. The standard maximum
   likelihood estimation method is practically infeasible due to the
   non-smooth nature of the likelihood function. We bypass the problem by
   introducing an alternative, smoother function that admits a
   better-defined maximum and show that the parameters that maximize this
   new function are asymptotically equivalent to maximum likelihood
   estimates. We use simulations to explore the influence of noise and
   available data on model Duffing and Lorenz oscillators. We then apply
   the approach to experimental data from a chaotic Duffing system. Our
   method does not require estimation of initial conditions and parameter
   estimates may be obtained even when system dynamics have been estimated
   from a delay embedding.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{101}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Thermoplastics under voltages are used in diverse applications ranging
   from insulating cables to organic capacitors. Electromechanical
   instabilities have been proposed as a mechanism that causes electrical
   breakdown of thermoplastics. However, existing experiments cannot
   provide direct observations of the instability process, and existing
   theories for the instabilities generally assume thermoplastics are
   mechanically unconstrained. Here, we report in situ observations of
   electromechanical instabilities in various thermoplastics. A theory is
   formulated for electromechanical instabilities of thermoplastics under
   different mechanical constraints. We find that the instabilities
   generally occur in thermoplastics when temperature is above their glass
   transition temperatures and electric field reaches a critical value. The
   critical electric field for the instabilities scales with square root of
   yield stress of the thermoplastic and depends on its Young's modulus and
   hardening property. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Flexible working angles and fine optical
   visualization are major requisite factors in performing laparoendoscopic
   single-site (LESS) urologic procedures. Multiple mechanical design
   approaches have been used to develop deflectable laparoscopes for LESS
   procedures. We compared the optical characteristics of three such
   devices using a bench top approach to simulate LESS in straight and
   deflected positions.
   Materials and Methods: A 10-mm fixed-rod rotating lens device (Storz
   EndoCameleon) and two 5-mm articulating devices (Olympus EndoEye and
   Stryker IdealEye) were compared using standard industry testing
   protocols for image resolution (United States Air Force-1951 test
   target), distortion (multifrequency grid distortion target), and color
   reproducibility (Gretag Macbeth color checker).
   Results: The 10-mmfixed-rod rotating lens system demonstrated the
   highest image resolution (5.04 line pairs/mm), but also the highest
   distortion (22.8\%). Among the 5-mm flexible articulating laparoscopes,
   resolution was superior with the Olympus EndoEye (4.00 line pairs/mm)
   compared with the Stryker IdealEye (3.17 line pairs/mm). Distortion
   (7.0\%) and color reproduction (1.18) were superior with the IdealEye vs
   the EndoEye (18.8 \%, 1.27). Laparoscope deflection resulted in
   attenuation of resolution by 11\% with both articulating models, but not
   with the fixed rod system.
   Conclusions: Definition of these optical characteristics may inform
   further development and selection of laparoscopic systems optimized for
   LESS surgery. A narrow but flexible camera can be crucial in the limited
   working space available during these procedures. Further investigation
   is warranted to determine if these objective findings translate into
   improved surgeon performance.}},

   controlling electron-impact dynamics in Ar ambients. That proof of
   concept demands the development of basic numerical models to aid device
   optimization. We address this need in the form of a two-fluid model of
   carrier transport dynamics in a bipolar VMD (BVMD). The fluid model
   captures the behavior of operational modes demonstrated in previously
   reported devices. Moreover, this approach promises insight into

Abstract = {{The present work demonstrates a genetic algorithm approach to optimizing
   the effective material parameters of an acoustic metamaterial. The
   target device is an acoustic gradient index (GRIN) lens in air, which
   ideally possesses a maximized index of refraction, minimized frequency
   dependence of the material properties, and minimized acoustic impedance
   mismatch. Applying this algorithm results in complex designs with
   certain common features, and effective material properties that are
   better than those present in previous designs. After modifying the
   optimized unit cell designs to make them suitable for fabrication, a
   two-dimensional lens was built and experimentally tested. Its
   performance was in good agreement with simulations. Overall, the
   optimization approach was able to improve the refractive index but at
   the cost of increased frequency dependence. The optimal solutions found
   by the algorithm provide a numerical description of how the material
   parameters compete with one another and thus describes the level of
   performance achievable in the GRIN lens. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{Despite recent advances in structural test methods, the diagnosis of the
   root cause of board-level failures for functional tests remains a major
   challenge. A promising approach to address this problem is to carry out
   fault diagnosis in two phases-suspect faulty components on the board or
   modules within components (together referred to as blocks in this paper)
   are first identified and ranked, and then fine-grained diagnosis is used
   to target the suspect blocks in a ranked order. We propose a new method
   based on dataflow analysis and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory for ranking
   faulty blocks in the first phase of diagnosis. The proposed approach
   transforms the information derived from one functional test failure into
   multiple-stage failures by partitioning the given functional test into
   multiple stages. A measure of ``belief{''} is then assigned to each
   block based on the knowledge of each failing stage, and the DS theory is
   subsequently used to aggregate the beliefs from multiple failing stages.
   Blocks with higher beliefs are ranked on the top of the candidate list.
   Simulations on an industry design for a network interface application as
   well as on an open source system-on-a-chip show that the proposed method
   can provide accurate ranking for most board-level functional failures.}},

Abstract = {{Because of cost and time, it is difficult to relate to students how
   fundamental chemical principles are involved in cutting edge biomedical
   breakthroughs being reported in the national media. The laboratory
   exercise presented here is aimed at high school chemistry students and
   uses alginate hydrogels, a common material used in tissue engineering,
   to help students explore the relationship between chemical bonding and
   material properties while relating it to the field of tissue
   engineering. In addition, this lab is designed as a model based
   inquiry.exercise to provide a better understanding of how contemporary
   science is practiced. The lab is intended to be used as part of a four
   day curriculum on tissue engineering but can be done together with the
   supporting curriculum or separately. The exercise is inexpensive,
   approximately \$6.00 per student group and can be performed in
   low-resource laboratories, as it requires no elaborate equipment. The
   students who completed these exercises showed enhanced understanding of
   ionic bonding and were able to describe how such bonding related to the
   properties of materials.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of large-scale forcing on the high-resolution simulation
   of Tropical Storm Ivan (2004) in the southern Appalachians was
   investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). Two
   forcing datasets were employed: the North American Regional Reanalysis
   (NARR; 32 km x 32 km) and the NCEP Final Operational Global Analysis
   (NCEP FNL; 1 degrees x 1 degrees). Simulated fields were evaluated
   against rain gauge, radar, and satellite data; sounding observations;
   and the best track from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Overall,
   the NCEP FNL forced simulation (WRF\_FNL) captures storm structure and
   evolution more accurately than the NARR forced simulation (WRF\_NARR),
   benefiting from the hurricane initialization scheme in the NCEP FNL.
   Further, the performance of WRF\_NARR is also negatively affected by a
   previously documented low-level warm bias in NARR. These factors lead to
   excessive precipitation in the Piedmont region, delayed rainfall in
   Alabama, as well as spatially displaced and unrealistically extreme
   rainbands during its passage over the southern Appalachians. Spatial
   filtering of the simulated precipitation fields confirms that the storm
   characteristics inherited from the forcing are critical to capture the
   storm's impact at local places. Compared with the NHC observations, the
   storm is weaker in both NARR and NCEP FNL (up to Delta p similar to 5
   hPa), yet it is persistently deeper in all WRF simulations forced by
   either dataset. The surface wind fields are largely overestimated. This
   is attributed to the underestimation of surface roughness length over
   land, leading to underestimation of surface drag, reducing low-level
   convergence, and weakening the dissipation of the simulated cyclone.}},

Abstract = {{Interstitial transport of large molecules and nanoparticles is an
   important concern in nanomedicine-mediated cancer treatment. To that
   end, the current study was proposed to improve the transport through
   enlargement of extracellular space by treating tumors with hypertonic
   solution of mannitol and cytotoxic agents (e.g., ethacrynic acid
   {[}ECA]), which could effectively shrink and kill cells, respectively.
   In the study, the improvement in interstitial penetration of dextran was
   investigated ex vivo using rat fibrosarcoma tissues sectioned into 600
   mu m slices. Experimental data showed that the hypertonic solution was
   more effective than ECA for improving interstitial penetration of
   dextran with molecular weights ranging from 4000 to 2,000,000. The
   extent of improvement depended on the size of dextran molecules and the
   time when the treatment was applied. Results from the study suggested
   that increases in both size and connectedness of interstitial pathways
   were important for improvement of interstitial transport of large
   molecules and nanoparticles.
   From the Clinical Editor: This study reports on the optimization of
   interstitial transport both for large molecules and nanoparticles in
   nanomedicine-mediated cancer treatment. The study demonstrates that
   hypertonic solutions could efficiently lead to cancer cell shrinkage and
   more so than the applied cytotoxic agent thereby improving transport of
   chemotherapeutic entities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},
