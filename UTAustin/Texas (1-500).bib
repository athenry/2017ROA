Abstract = {{Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and the associated microvascular
   hyperpermeability followed by brain edema are hallmark features of
   several brain pathologies, including traumatic brain injuries (TBI).
   Recent studies indicate that pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1
   beta (IL-1 beta) that is upregulated following traumatic injuries also
   promotes BBB dysfunction and hyperpermeability, but the underlying
   mechanisms are not clearly known. The objective of this study was to
   determine the role of calpains in mediating BBB dysfunction and
   hyperpermeability and to test the effect of calpain inhibition on
   theBBBfollowing traumatic insults to the brain. In these studies, rat
   brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers exposed to calpain
   inhibitors (calpain inhibitor III and calpastatin) or transfected with
   calpain-1 siRNA demonstrated attenuation of IL-1 beta-induced monolayer
   hyperpermeability. Calpain inhibition led to protection against IL-1
   beta-induced loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at the tight junctions
   and alterations in F-actin cytoskeletal assembly. IL-1 beta treatment
   had no effect on ZO-1 gene (tjp1) or protein expression. Calpain
   inhibition via calpain inhibitor III and calpastatin decreased IL-1
   beta-induced calpain activity significantly (p < 0.05). IL-1 beta had no
   detectable effect on intracellular calcium mobilization or endothelial
   cell viability. Furthermore, calpain inhibition preserved BBB
   integrity/permeability in a mouse controlled cortical impact model of
   TBI when studied using Evans blue assay and intravital microscopy. These
   studies demonstrate that calpain-1 acts as a mediator of IL-1
   beta-induced loss of BBB integrity and permeability by altering tight
   junction integrity, promoting the displacement of ZO-1, and
   disorganization of cytoskeletal assembly. IL-1 beta-mediated alterations
   in permeability are neither due to the changes in ZO-1 expression nor
   cell viability. Calpain inhibition has beneficial effects against
   TBI-induced BBB hyperpermeability.}},

Abstract = {{The directed self-assembly (DSA) of a 20 nm full-pitch
   silicon-containing block copolymer (BCP),
   poly(4-methoxystyrene-b-4-trimethylsilylstyrene), was performed using a
   process that produces shallow topography for hybrid
   chemo-/grapho-epitaxy. This hybrid process produced DSA with fewer
   defects than the analogous conventional chemo-epitaxial process, and the
   resulting DSA was also more tolerant of variations in process
   parameters. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy
   (STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirmed that BCP
   features spanned the entire film thickness on hybrid process wafers.
   Both processes were implemented on 300 mm wafers initially prepatterned
   by 193 nm immersion lithography, which is necessary for economic
   viability in high-volume manufacturing. Computational analysis of DSA
   extracted from top-down SEM images demonstrates the influence of process
   parameters on DSA, facilitating the optimization of guide stripe width,
   guide stripe pitch, and prepattern surface energy. This work
   demonstrates the ability of a hybrid process to improve the DSA quality
   over a conventional chemo-epitaxial process and the potential for high
   volume manufacturing with high-x, silicon-containing BCPs.}},

Abstract = {{With an aim of enhancing their high-temperature phase stability,
   oxygen-storage capability, and electrocatalytic activity in
   intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs),
   RBaCo4O(7+delta)-based samples have been investigated with a
   co-substitution at the R site with Y, In, and Ca and Ga substitution at
   the Co site. YBaCo4-yGayO7+delta, Y1-xInxBaCo3.3Ga0.7O7+delta,
   Y1-xBaCo3.3Ga0.7O7+delta, In1-xCaxBaCo3.3Ga0.7O7+delta, and
   Y(0.51)n(0.3)BaCo4(-y)GayO(7+delta) series of materials have been
   synthesized by a solid-state reaction, and the phase stabilities have
   been assessed by long-term testing at 600-800 degrees C for 120 h. The
   substitution of In for Y mitigates the phase decomposition but decreases
   the oxygen-storage capacity and electrochemical performance in IT-SOFCs.
   With In and Y co-dopants, YasIn(0.5)BaCo(3.5)Ga(0.3)O(7+delta) remains
   stable even with a smaller amount of Ga. In contrast, Ca doping reduces
   the phase stability regardless of its content. Via optimization of the
   compositions, Y0.9In0.1BaCo3.3Ga0.7O7+delta is found to exhibit the best
   electrochemical performance without decomposition in the long-term test
   at 600-800 degrees C. The anode supported single cell with the
   Y0.9In0.1BaCo3.3Ga0.7O7+delta GDC composite cathode reaches a maximum
   power density of 0.91 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, which is the highest
   reported for this class of materials. Moreover, the ideal matching of
   the relatively low thermal expansion coefficient of
   Y0.9In0.1BaCo3.3Ga0.7O7+delta (7.5-9.2 x 10(-6) K-1) with those of
   common electrolytes alleviates the thermal stress during long-term
   operation in IT-SOFCs. The combination of long-term phase stability,
   high oxygen-storage capability, and electrocatalytic properties makes
   the Y0.9In0.1BaCo3.3Ga0.7O7+delta GDC composite cathode appealing for
   practical application in IT-SOFCs.}},

Abstract = {{Gd2Sn2O7 and Gd2Ti2O7 have been regarded as good experimental
   realizations of the classical Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet with
   dipolar interaction. The former was found to adopt the Palmer-Chalker
   state via a single, first-order transition at T-N approximate to 1K,
   while the latter enters a distinct, partially ordered state through two
   successive transitions at T-N1 approximate to 1K and T-N2 = 0.75 K. To
   shed more light on their distinct magnetic ground states, we have
   synthesized two more gadolinium-based pyrochlore oxides, Gd2Ge2O7
   andGd(2)Pt(2)O(7), under highpressure conditions and performed detailed
   characterizations via x-ray powder diffraction, dc and ac magnetic
   susceptibility, and specific heat measurements down to 100 mK. We found
   that both compounds enter a long-range antiferromagnetically ordered
   state through a single, first-order transition at TN = 1.4K for Gd2Ge2O7
   and TN = 1.56K for Gd2Pt2O7, with the specific heat anomaly similar to
   that of Gd2Sn2O7 rather than Gd2Ti2O7. Interestingly, the
   low-temperature magnetic specific heat values of both Gd2Ge2O7 and
   Gd2Pt2O7 were found to follow nicely the T-3 dependence as expected for
   a three-dimensional antiferromagnet with gapless spin-wave excitations.
   We have rationalized the enhancement of TN in terms of the reduced Gd-Gd
   distances for the chemically pressurized Gd2Ge2O7 and the addition of
   extra superexchange pathways through the empty Pt -eg orbitals for
   Gd2Pt2O7. Our current study has expanded the family of gadolinium-based
   pyrochlores and permits us to achieve a better understanding of their
   distinct magnetic properties in a more comprehensive perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Germanium (Ge) nanowires coated with an amorphous silicon (Si) shell
   undergoing lithiation and delithiation were studied using in situ
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Delithiation creates pores in
   nanowires with diameters larger than similar to 25 nm, but not in
   smaller diameter nanowires. The formation of pores in Ge nanowires
   undergoing delithiation has been observed before in in situ TEM
   experiments, but there has been no indication that a critical diameter
   exists below which pores do not form. Pore formation occurs as a result
   of fast lithium diffusion compared to vacancy migration. We propose that
   a short diffusion path for vacancies to the nanowire surface plays a
   role in limiting pore formation even when lithium diffusion is fast.}},

Abstract = {{A NaSICON-type Li+-ion conductive membrane with a formula of
   Li1+xYxZr2-x(PO4)(3) (LYZP) (x = 0-0.15) has been explored as a
   solid-electrolyte/ separator to suppress polysulfide-crossover in
   lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The LYZP membrane with a reasonable
   Li+-ion conductivity shows both favorable chemical compatibility with
   the lithium polysulfide species and exhibits good electrochemical
   stability under the operating conditions of the Li-S batteries. Through
   an integration of the LYZP solid electrolyte with the liquid
   electrolyte, the hybrid Li-S batteries show greatly enhanced cyclability
   in contrast to the conventional Li-S batteries with the porous polymer
   (e. g., Celgard) separator. At a rate of C/5, the hybrid Li parallel to
   LYZP parallel to Li2S6 batteries developed in this study (with a
   Li-metal anode, a liquid/LYZP hybrid electrolyte, and a dissolved
   lithium polysulfide cathode) delivers an initial discharge capacity of
   approximate to 1000 mA h g(-1) (based on the active sulfur material) and
   retains approximate to 90\% of the initial capacity after 150 cycles
   with a low capacity fade-rate of <0.07\% per cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical double layer capacitors, or super capacitors, are
   high-power energy storage devices that consist of large surface area
   electrodes (filled with electrolyte) to accommodate ion packing in
   accordance with classical electric double layer (EDL) theory. Nanoporous
   carbons (NPCs) have recently emerged as a class of electrode materials
   with the potential to dramatically improve the capacitance of these
   devices by leveraging ion confinement. However, the molecular mechanisms
   underlying such enhancements are a clear departure from EDL theory and
   remain an open question. In this paper, we present the concept of ion
   reorganization kinetics during charge/discharge cycles, especially
   within highly confining subnanometer pores, which necessarily dictates
   the capacitance. Our molecular dynamics voltammetric simulations of
   ionic liquid immersed in NPC electrodes (of varying pore size
   distributions) demonstrate that the most efficient ion migration, and
   thereby largest capacitance, is facilitated by nonuniformity of shape
   (e.g., from cylindrical to slitlike) along nanopore channels. On the
   basis of this understanding, we propose that a new structural
   descriptor, coined as the pore shape factor, can provide a new avenue
   for materials optimization. These findings also present a framework to
   understand and evaluate ion migration kinetics within charged nanoporous
   materials.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the system-size dependence of the thermodynamic
   properties of ionic fluids under periodic boundary conditions. Following
   an approach previously developed in the context of quantum Monte Carlo
   simulations of many-electron systems, we show that the leading-order
   finite-size artifact in the Coulomb energy per particle of a classical
   fluid of N structureless ions at given density and temperature is simply
   -k(B)T(2N)(-1). Analytical approximations for the periodicity-induced
   size dependence of the excess thermodynamic properties of the fluid in
   the weak-coupling regime are obtained within the linearized Debye-Huckel
   theory. Theoretical results are compared with published simulations of
   the one-component plasma and our own simulations of a primitive-model
   electrolyte solution. Our work is directly relevant to estimating
   finite-size corrections in simulations of charged fluids comprising
   structureless ions embedded in continuous media. We outline in the
   Appendix how some of our formal results may be generalized to molecular
   fluids with mobile ions; e.g., electrolyte solutions with explicit
   solvent. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma cells in human bone marrow (BM) are thought to be responsible for
   sustaining lifelong immunity, but its underlying basis is controversial.
   Here we use high-throughput sequence analysis of the same individual
   across 6.5 years to show that the BM plasma cell immunoglobulin heavy
   chain repertoire is remarkably stable over time. We find a nearly static
   bias in individual and combinatorial gene usage across time. Analysis of
   a second donor corroborates these observations. We also report the
   persistence of numerous BM plasma cell clonotypes (similar to 2\%)
   identifiable at all points assayed across 6.5 years, supporting a model
   of serological memory based upon intrinsic longevity of human plasma
   cells. Donors were adolescents who completely recovered from
   neuroblastoma prior to the start of this study. Our work will facilitate
   differentiation between healthy and diseased antibody repertoires, by
   serving as a point of comparison with future deep-sequencing studies

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials have several advantages in detecting several biomaterials
   and in enhancing signals and their inherent effects. Thus, they have
   been widely applied in the biomedical fields such as biosensor and
   cancer therapeutics. Recently, the development of microfluidic
   technology has led to superior biological analysis systems to detect
   biomarkers related to diseases or serve as in vitro drug screening
   platform. In a micro fluidic device, samples could be analyzed more
   accurately, rapidly and simply. In addition, it is possible to culture
   the cells in these microfluidic devices, therefore making the in situ
   analysis of secretomes easy. Nano materials can be easily applied in the
   microfluidic channels as capturing and signaling materials in order to
   improve the sensing or therapeutic property. In particular, nanomaterial
   integrated microfluidic cell culture model can replace in vivo disease
   models for nanotherapeutics screening. In this review,
   nanomaterial-based sensing systems, which include diverse organic and
   inorganic nanoparticles, are introduced with specific examples,
   including microfluidics integrated systems. Moreover, microfluidics
   derived nanomaterial analytic systems as in vitro 2 or 3-dimensional (2D
   or 3D) cell culture platform will be presented. We also highlight the
   future perspectives of the microfluidic-driven system as highly
   sensitive total analysis system with functional nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and superconductivity of WTe2 under pressure are
   investigated using ab initio calculations combined with high-pressure
   synchrotron x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. We find that the
   emergence of superconductivity in WTe2 under pressure can be attributed
   to the phase transition from ambient T-d phase to the monoclinic 1T'
   structure phase at around 4-5 GPa, which is associated with a sliding of
   the WTe2 layers, resulting in a critical point in the changes of Te-Te
   interlayer distance. This phase transition introduces an inversion
   center and eliminates the topological Weyl fermions in the T-d
   structure. Electron-phonon coupling calculations predict a similar T-c
   as the reported value, implying that WTe2 might belong to conventional
   normal Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors.}},

Title = {{Constrained selective dynamic time warping of trajectories in three

Journal = {{CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{138-150}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Three dimensional data structures such as batch process data or
   infra-red spectral measurements usually contain inconsistent
   trajectories of various durations and quality. In the case of batch
   process data, most modeling methods require the data from all batches to
   be of same duration. For spectral data, peaks might be shifted from one
   sample to another due to unaccounted sources of variation. These
   inconsistencies are usually resolved through trajectory alignment (or
   synchronization) methods. In this paper, we first review the
   deficiencies of existing approaches. Next, a Constrained selective
   Derivative Dynamic Time Warping (CsDTW) method is proposed to perform
   automatic alignment of trajectories. Different from conventional
   methods, CsDTW preserves key features that characterizes the batch and
   only apply warping to regions of least impact to trajectory
   characterization. The proposed warping technique is applied to both
   industrial and simulated datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.}},

Title = {{Can Exciton-Delocalizing Ligands Facilitate Hot Hole Transfer from
   Semiconductor Nanocrystals?}},

Abstract = {{Exciton-delocalizing ligands (EDLs) are of interest to researchers due
   to their ability to allow charge carriers to spread into the ligand
   shell of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). By increasing charge carrier
   surface accessibility, EDLs may facilitate the extraction of highly
   photoexcited carriers from NCs prior to their relaxation to the band
   edge, a process that can boost the performance of NC based
   photocatalysts and light harvesting systems. However, hot carrier
   extraction must compete with carrier cooling, which could be accelerated
   by the stronger interaction of charge carriers and EDLs. This report
   describes the influence of the EDL phenyldithiocarbamate (FTC) on the
   electron and hole cooling rates of CdSe NCs. Using state-resolved
   transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that PTC treatment
   accelerates hole cooling by a factor of 1.7. However, upon further
   treatment of these NCs with cadmium(II) acetate, the hole cooling rate
   reverts to the value measured prior to PTC treatment, yet these NCs
   maintain a red-shifted absorption spectrum indicative of PTC bound to
   the NC surface. This result provides strong evidence for the existence
   of two distinct surface-bound PTC species: one that traps holes before
   they cool and can be removed by cadmium(II) acetate, and a second
   species that facilitates exciton delocalization. This conclusion is
   supported by both DFT calculations and photoluminescence measurements.
   The outlook from our work is that EDLs do not necessarily lead to an
   acceleration of carrier cooling, suggesting that they may provide a path
   for hot carrier extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Zn-metalloproteins are a major class of targets for drug design. They
   constitute a demanding testing ground for polarizable molecular
   mechanics/dynamics aimed at extending the realm of quantum chemistry
   (QC) to very long-duration molecular dynamics (MD). The reliability of
   such procedures needs to be demonstrated upon comparing the relative
   stabilities of competing candidate complexes of inhibitors with the
   recognition site stabilized in the course of MD. This could be necessary
   when no information is available regarding the experimental structure of
   the inhibitor-protein complex. Thus, this study bears on the
   phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) enzyme, considered as a potential
   therapeutic target for the treatment of several bacterial and parasitic
   diseases. We consider its complexes with
   5-phospho-D-arabinonohydroxamate and three analog ligands differing by
   the number and location of their hydroxyl groups. We evaluate the energy
   accuracy expectable from a polarizable molecular mechanics procedure,
   SIBFA. This is done by comparisons with ab initio quantum-chemistry (QC)
   calculations in the following cases: (a) the complexes of the four
   ligands in three distinct structures extracted from the entire
   PMI-ligand energy-minimized structures, and totaling up to 264 atoms;
   (b) the solvation energies of several energy-minimized complexes of each
   ligand with a shell of 64 water molecules; (c) the conformational energy
   differences of each ligand in different conformations characterized in
   the course of energy-minimizations; and (d) the continuum solvation
   energies of the ligands in different conformations. The agreements with
   the QC results appear convincing. On these bases, we discuss the
   prospects of applying the procedure to ligand-macromolecule recognition
   problems. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We present a tetrahedral finite cell method for the simulation of
   incompressible flow around geometrically complex objects. The method
   immerses such objects into non-boundary-fitted meshes of tetrahedral
   finite elements and weakly enforces Dirichlet boundary conditions on the
   objects' surfaces. Adaptively-refined quadrature rules faithfully
   capture the flow domain geometry in the discrete problem without
   modifying the non-boundary-fitted finite element mesh. A variational
   multiscale formulation provides accuracy and robustness in both laminar
   and turbulent flow conditions. We assess the accuracy of the method by
   analyzing the flow around an immersed sphere for a wide range of
   Reynolds numbers. We show that quantities of interest such as the drag
   coefficient, Strouhal number and pressure distribution over the sphere
   are in very good agreement with reference values obtained from standard
   boundary-fitted approaches. We place particular emphasis on studying the
   importance of the geometry resolution in intersected elements. Aligning
   with the immersogeometric concept, our results show that the faithful
   representation of the geometry in intersected elements is critical for
   accurate flow analysis. We demonstrate the potential of our proposed
   method for high-fidelity industrial scale simulations by performing an
   aerodynamic analysis of an agricultural tractor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel narrowband interference (NBI) mitigation
   scheme for single carrier-frequency division multiple access systems.
   The proposed NBI cancellation scheme exploits the frequency-domain
   sparsity of the unknown signal and adopts a low complexity Bayesian
   sparse recovery procedure. At the transmitter, a few randomly chosen
   data locations are kept data free to sense the NBI signal at the
   receiver. Furthermore, it is noted that in practice, the sparsity of the
   NBI signal is destroyed by a grid mismatch between the NBI sources and
   the system under consideration. Toward this end, first, an accurate grid
   mismatch model is presented that is capable of assuming independent
   offsets for multiple NBI sources, and second, the sparsity of the
   unknown signal is restored prior to reconstruction using a sparsifying
   transform. To improve the spectral efficiency of the proposed scheme, a
   data-aided NBI recovery procedure is outlined that relies on adaptively
   selecting a subset of data-points and using them as additional
   measurements. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed scheme for NBI mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence of a recently proposed coupled cluster (CC) family of
   perturbation series {[}J. J. Eriksen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108
   (2014)], in which the energetic difference between two CC models-a
   low-level parent and a high-level target model-is expanded in orders of
   the Moller-Plesset (MP) fluctuation potential, is investigated for four
   prototypical closed-shell systems (Ne, singlet CH2, distorted HF, and
   F-) in standard and augmented basis sets. In these investigations,
   energy corrections of the various series have been calculated to high
   orders and their convergence radii have been determined by probing for
   possible front-and back-door intruder states, the existence of which
   would make the series divergent. In summary, we conclude how it is
   primarily the choice of the target state, and not the choice of the
   parent state, which ultimately governs the convergence behavior of a
   given series. For example, restricting the target state to, say, triple
   or quadruple excitations might remove intruders present in series which
   target the full configuration interaction limit, such as the standard MP
   series. Furthermore, we find that whereas a CC perturbation series might
   converge within standard correlation consistent basis sets, it may start
   to diverge whenever these become augmented by diffuse functions, similar
   to the MP case. However, unlike for the MP case, such potential
   divergences are not found to invalidate the practical use of the
   low-order corrections of the CC perturbation series. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{Supercritical CO2 injection is a promising way to hydraulically fracture
   tight/shale gas formations as well as enhance gas recovery from these
   formations. Understanding of phase behavior and interfacial tension
   (IFT) of CO2/CH4/brine (NaCl) systems is important, because they affect
   the performance of such a process in tight/shale gas formations. In this
   study, we employ the axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) method to
   measure the IFT between CO2/CH4 mixtures and brine over the temperature
   range from 77.0 to 257.0 degrees F and the pressure range from 15 to
   5027 psia. Test results show that the presence of CO2 decreases the IFT
   of CH4/H2O or CH4/brine (NaCl) systems, while the degree of reduction
   depends on the molar fraction of CO2 in the gas mixture. Salinity tends
   to cause an increase in IFT of CO2/CH4/brine (NaCl) systems; a higher
   salinity leads to an increased IFT for a given system. On the basis of
   the Parachor model (Weinaug and Katz J. Ind. Eng. Chem. 1943, 35, 239)
   and Firoozabadi's model (Firoozabadi and Ramey J. Can. Pet. Technol.
   1988, 27, 41), we propose an improved IFT model to represent the
   measured IFT data for CO2/CH4/brine systems. The new IFT model preserves
   the principle of zero IFT at a critical point. Comparison of the new IFT
   model with four commonly used IFT correlations presented in the
   literature shows the superiority of the new model.}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art energy storage devices are capable of delivering
   reasonably high energy density (lithium ion batteries) or high power
   density (supercapacitors). There is an increasing need for these power

   exceptional flexibility. Graphene has come on to the scene and
   advancements are being made in integration of various electrochemically
   active compounds onto graphene or its derivatives so as to utilize their
   flexibility. Many innovative synthesis techniques have led to novel
   graphene-based hybrid two-dimensional nanostructures. Here, the
   chemically integrated inorganic-graphene hybrid two-dimensional
   materials and their applications for energy storage devices are
   examined. First, the synthesis and characterization of different kinds
   of inorganic-graphene hybrid nanostructures are summarized, and then the
   most relevant applications of inorganic-graphene hybrid materials in
   flexible energy storage devices are reviewed. The general design rules
   of using graphene-based hybrid 2D materials for energy storage devices

Abstract = {{Inelastic neutron scattering combined with the dynamic pair density
   function (DPDF) analysis were used to investigate the magnetic and
   lattice dynamics in the orbitally active Y1-xLaxTiO3 as it crosses the
   antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phase boundary. Upon
   doping, the FM state present in YTiO3 is suppressed on approaching a
   critical concentration of x(c) similar to 0.3 in which T-C similar or
   equal to 0, and is replaced by the AFM phase of LaTiO3. Below x(c),
   magnetic scattering from spin waves is dominant at low energies. At x(c)
   with a T-C similar or equal to 0, magnetic scattering is also observed
   and is most likely due to AFM fluctuations. At the same time, local
   atomic fluctuations extending to 50 meV are observed above and below the
   magnetic transitions from 0 <= x <= 1 that show distinct characteristics
   with x. From Y to La, a clear difference is observed in the phonon
   density of states as a function of doping as well. At x = 0.15 and 0.3,
   low-energy modes involving predominantly the rare-earth ion become
   suppressed with increasing temperature, while in x = 1, strong
   suppression of phonon modes across a wide range in energy is observed
   above T-N. It is likely that in the Y heavy samples, phonon modes below
   20 meV have a stronger influence on the orbital excitations, while in
   LaTiO3, a strong phonon dependence is observed upon cooling up to T-N.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile and short-term monitoring campaigns are increasingly used to
   develop land-use regression (LUR) models for ultrafine particles (UFP)
   and black carbon (BC). It is not yet established whether LUR models
   based on mobile or short-term stationary measurements result in
   comparable models and concentration predictions. The goal of this paper
   is to compare LUR models based on stationary (30 min) and mobile UFP and
   BC measurements from a single campaign. An electric car collected both
   repeated stationary and mobile measurements in Amsterdam and Rotterdam,
   The Netherlands. A total of 2964 road segments and 161 stationary sites
   were sampled over two seasons. Our main comparison was based on
   predicted concentrations of the mobile and stationary monitoring LUR
   models at 12 682 residential addresses in Amsterdam. Predictor variables
   in the mobile and stationary LUR model were comparable, resulting in
   highly correlated predictions at external residential addresses (R-2 of
   0.89 for UFP and 0.88 for BC). Mobile model predictions were, on
   average, 1.41 and 1.91 times higher than stationary model predictions
   for UFP and BC, respectively. LUR models based upon mobile and
   stationary monitoring predicted highly correlated UFP and BC
   concentration surfaces, but predicted concentrations based on mobile
   measurements were systematically higher.}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{360-370}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new constitutive model for isothermal pseudoelastic
   shape memory alloys is presented. The model is based upon a kinematic
   hardening framework that was previously developed for ferroelastic and
   ferroelectric switching behavior. The basis of the model includes a
   transformation surface, an associated flow rule for transformation
   strain, and kinematic hardening with the back stresses represented by a
   transformation potential that is dependent upon the transformation
   strain. In contrast to many models that introduce tension/compression
   asymmetry by devising transformation surfaces in terms of invariants of
   the stress tensor, this model achieves this capability by means of
   expressing the transformation potential from which the back stresses are
   derived as a weighted mix of two potentials that are, respectively,
   calibrated to measured tensile and compressive responses. Additionally,
   in this model, plastic deformation is allowed to occur at high stresses
   by employing a standard J(2)-based yield surface with isotropic
   hardening. Finally, to demonstrate the ability of the constitutive model
   to perform in highly non-proportional loading states, some finite
   element simulations on crack tip fields are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the ability of Ni/Mo2C to catalyze the Methane
   Bireforming Reaction (combined Dry Methane Reforming Reaction, CH4 + CO2
   -> 2H(2) + 2CO and Steam Methane Reforming Reaction, CH4 + H2O -> 3H(2)
   + CO). By varying the ratio of CO2:H2O, the resulting H-2:CO ratio could
   be tuned from 0.91 to 3.0, covering a wide range of Syn-gas (H-2 + CO)
   ratios relevant to various hydrocarbon syntheses. We also document the
   unusual deactivation behavior of Ni/Mo2C in this system. The catalytic
   activity would change from very high (>50\% conversion) to very low
   (<10\% conversion) within 10 min. Despite running under conditions
   typically favorable for coking with a Ni catalyst (high temperature, 950
   degrees C, and excess methane), XRD, TGA, TEM, SEM, and EDX results
   clearly show no evidence of coking during the reaction or after
   deactivation. In addition, the changes to the Ni/Mo2C catalyst seen
   after deactivation (oxidation of Mo2C to MoO2, Ni-phase changes, and
   catalyst morphology changes) could not be seen in the catalyst subjected
   to reaction conditions that were halted before deactivation could occur.
   This suggests a sudden, rapid deactivation ``event{''} occurs in this
   catalytic system as opposed to gradual catalyst deactivation, a behavior
   more typically seen with catalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The Effect of Rib Turbulators on Film Cooling Effectiveness of Round
   Compound Angle Holes Fed by an Internal Cross-Flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Early stage gas turbine blades feature complicated internal geometries
   in order to enhance internal heat transfer and to supply coolant for
   film cooling. Most film cooling experiments decouple the effect of
   internal coolant feed from external film cooling effectiveness, even
   though engine parts are commonly fed by cross-flow and feature internal
   rib turbulators which can affect film cooling. Experiments measuring
   adiabatic effectiveness were conducted to investigate the effects of
   turbulated perpendicular cross-flow on a row of 45 deg compound angle
   cylindrical film cooling holes for a total of eight internal rib
   configurations. The ribs were angled to the direction of prevailing
   internal cross-flow at two different angles: 45 deg or 135 deg. The ribs
   were also positioned at two different spanwise locations relative to the
   cooling holes: in the middle of the cooling hole pitch and slightly
   intersecting the holes. Experiments were conducted at a density ratio of
   DR = 1.5 for a range of blowing ratios including M = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0,
   1.5, and 2.0. This study demonstrates that peak effectiveness can be
   attained through the optimization of cross-flow direction relative to
   the compound angle direction and rib configuration, verifying the
   importance of hole inlet conditions in film cooling experiments. It was
   found that ribs tend to reduce adiabatic effectiveness relative to a
   baseline, smooth-walled configuration. Rib configurations that directed
   the internal coolant forward in the direction of the mainstream resulted
   in higher peak adiabatic effectiveness. However, no other parameters
   could consistently be identified correlating to increased film cooling
   performance. It is likely that a combination of factors is responsible
   for influencing performance, including internal local pressure caused by
   the ribs, the internal channel flow field, in-hole vortices, and jet
   exit velocity profiles. This study also attempted to replicate the
   possibility that film cooling holes may intersect ribs and found that a
   hole which partially intersects a rib still maintains moderate levels of
   effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Building owners and design teams rely greatly on building energy models
   to identify effective strategies for maximizing building energy
   performance. However, past studies of building energy-model performance,
   particularly among Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
   (LEED)-certified buildings, have shown that models can vary
   significantly at the individual building level. Conducting retrospective
   analyses of building energy models can provide more insight regarding
   empirical variation and models' sources of error than past studies that
   reported the observed difference between predicted and actual annual
   energy performances. This paper describes a method for conducting
   retrospective analyses on building-energy models, and then applies the
   method to three LEED-certified dormitory buildings that are owned and
   operated by the U.S. Department of Defense. All three buildings
   contained varying levels of actual building-energy data, which served to
   illustrate the extent to which model error may be explained. Significant
   changes in building occupancy, as evidenced through building occupancy
   reports as well as building water-consumption data, represented the
   greatest source of deviation. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Variable flip angle (VFA) sequences are a popular method of calculating
   T1 values, which are required in a quantitative analysis of dynamic
   contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). B1
   inhomogeneities are substantial in the breast at 3 T, and these errors
   negatively impact the accuracy of the VFA approach, thus leading to
   large errors in the DCE-MRI parameters that could limit clinical
   adoption of the technique. This study evaluated the ability of
   Bloch-Siegert B1 mapping to improve the accuracy and precision of
   VFA-derived T1 measurements in the breast. Test-retest MRI sessions were
   performed on 16 women with no history of breast disease. T1 was
   calculated using the VFA sequence, and B1 field variations were measured
   using the Bloch-Siegert methodology. As a gold standard, inversion
   recovery (IR) measurements of T1 were performed. Fibroglandular tissue
   and adipose tissue from each breast were segmented using the IR images,
   and the mean T1 was calculated for each tissue. Accuracy was evaluated
   by percent error (\% err). Reproducibility was assessed via the 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) of the mean difference and repeatability
   coefficient (r). After B1 correction, \% err significantly (P < .001)
   decreased from 17\% to 8.6\%, and the 95\% CI and r decreased from +/-
   94 to +/- 38 milliseconds and from 276 to 111 milliseconds,
   respectively. Similar accuracy and reproducibility results were observed
   in the adipose tissue of the right breast and in both tissues of the
   left breast. Our data show that Bloch-Siegert B1 mapping improves
   accuracy and precision of VFA-derived T1 measurements in the breast.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative magnetization transfer magnetic resonance imaging provides
   a means for indirectly detecting changes in the macromolecular content
   of tissue noninvasively. A potential application is the diagnosis and
   assessment of treatment response in breast cancer; however, before
   quantitative magnetization transfer imaging can be reliably used in such
   settings, the technique's reproducibility in healthy breast tissue must
   be established. Thus, this study aims to establish the reproducibility
   of the measurement of the macromolecular-to-free water proton pool size
   ratio (PSR) in healthy fibroglandular (FG) breast tissue. Thirteen women
   with no history of breast disease were scanned twice within a single
   scanning session, with repositioning between scans. Eleven women had
   appreciable FG tissue for test-retest measurements. Mean PSR values for
   the FG tissue ranged from 9.5\% to 16.7\%. The absolute value of the
   difference between 2 mean PSR measurements for each volunteer ranged
   from 0.1\% to 2.1\%. The 95\% confidence interval for the mean
   difference was +/- 0.75\%, and the repeatability value was 2.39\%. These
   results indicate that the expected measurement variability would be +/-
   0.75\% for a cohort of a similar size and would be +/- 2.39\% for an
   individual, suggesting that future studies of change in PSR in patients
   with breast cancer are feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Patient accrual is essential for the success of oncology clinical
   trials. Recruitment for trials involving the development of quantitative
   imaging biomarkers may face different challenges than treatment trials.
   This study surveyed investigators and study personnel for evaluating
   accrual performance and perceived barriers to accrual and for soliciting
   solutions to these accrual challenges that are specific to quantitative
   imaging-based trials. Responses for 25 prospective studies were received
   from 12 sites. The median percent annual accrual attained was 94.5\%
   (range, 3\%-350\%). The most commonly selected barrier to recruitment (n
   = 11/ 25, 44\%) was that ``patients decline participation, ``followed by
   ``too few eligible patients{''} (n = 10/ 25, 40\%). In a forced choice
   for the single greatest recruitment challenge, ``too few eligible
   patients{''} was the most common response (n = 8/ 25, 32\%).
   Quantitative analysis and qualitative responses suggested that
   interactions among institutional, physician, and patient factors
   contributed to accrual success and challenges. Multidisciplinary
   collaboration in trial design and execution is essential to accrual
   success, with attention paid to ensuring and communicating potential
   trial benefits to enrolled and future patients.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that system-dependent gradient nonlinearity
   (GNL) introduces a significant spatial bias (nonuniformity) in apparent
   diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Here, the feasibility of centralized
   retrospective system-specific correction of GNL bias for quantitative
   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in multisite clinical trials is
   demonstrated across diverse scanners independent of the scanned object.
   Using corrector maps generated from system characterization by ice-water
   phantom measurement completed in the previous project phase, GNL bias
   correction was performed for test ADC measurements from an independent
   DWI phantom (room temperature agar) at two offset locations in the bore.
   The precomputed three-dimensional GNL correctors were retrospectively
   applied to test DWI scans by the central analysis site. The correction
   was blinded to reference DWI of the agar phantom at magnet isocenter
   where the GNL bias is negligible. The performance was evaluated from
   changes in ADC region of interest histogram statistics before and after
   correction with respect to the unbiased reference ADC values provided by
   sites. Both absolute error and nonuniformity of the ADC map induced by
   GNL (median, 12\%; range, - 35\% to + 10\%) were substantially reduced
   by correction (7-fold in median and 3-fold in range). The residual ADC
   nonuniformity errors were attributed to measurement noise and other
   non-GNL sources. Correction of systematic GNL bias resulted in a 2-fold
   decrease in technical variability across scanners (down to site
   temperature range). The described validation of GNL bias correction
   marks progress toward implementation of this technology in multicenter
   trials that utilize quantitative DWI.}},

Abstract = {{Polynomial chaos expansion and Gaussian mixture models are combined in a
   hybrid fashion to propagate state uncertainty for spacecraft with
   initial Gaussian errors. Polynomial chaos expansion models uncertainty
   by performing an expansion using orthogonal polynomials. The accuracy of
   polynomial chaos expansion for a given problem can be improved by
   increasing the order of the orthogonal polynomial expansion. The number
   of terms in the orthogonal polynomial expansion increases factorially
   with dimensionality of the problem, thereby reducing the effectiveness
   of the polynomial chaos expansion approach for problems of moderately
   high dimensionality. This paper shows a combination of Gaussian mixture
   model and polynomial chaos expansion, Gaussian mixture model-polynomial
   chaos expansion as an alternative form of the multi-element polynomial
   chaos expansion. Gaussian mixture model-polynomial chaos expansion
   reduces the overall order required to reach a desired accuracy. The
   initial distribution is converted to a Gaussian mixture model, and
   polynomial chaos expansion is used to propagate the state uncertainty
   represented by each of the elements through the nonlinear dynamics.
   Splitting the initial distribution into a Gaussian mixture model reduces
   the size of the covariance associated with each new element, thereby
   reducing the domain of approximation and allowing for lower-order
   polynomials to be used. Several spacecraft uncertainty propagation
   examples are shown using Gaussian mixture model-polynomial chaos
   expansion. The resulting distributions are shown to efficiently capture
   the full shape of the true non-Gaussian distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Exploration drilling is venturing into deeper regions of water. During
   the exploration of these deeper water depths, large hydrocarbon deposits
   have been found below salt formations. These reservoirs are called
   ``presalts,{''} which are below the salt formations. Presalt reservoirs
   have been found in offshore Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), West
   Africa, and the North Sea. Completions in salt formations can be
   difficult because of the creep behavior that the salt formations
   exhibit. Creep behavior results from the instability of the salt
   formation, which causes a slow flow and permanent deformations. Creep
   deformation occurs over time and begins once the salt formation has been
   penetrated. Completion of the wellbore does not stop formation creep.
   The constant creep of the salt formation causes excess stress on the
   wellbore casing, which may eventually cause the casing to collapse. In
   this study, a 3D geomechanical model is developed, by use of data such
   as wellbore pressure and temperature; formation stress and temperature;
   rock, cement, and casing properties, to predict the effects of
   salt-creep behavior on stress loading in the wellbore casing, which
   helps to assess the life expectancy of wells in presalt reservoirs. The
   simulation results of this model can provide quantitative results of
   casing stress and deformation as a function of time under various
   temperature, in-situ-stress, and operation conditions, which can be used
   as useful information for subsequent wellbore-casing design and
   wellbore-integrity analysis. In addition, possible methods that can
   mitigate the severity of salt mobility and reduce the risks of casing
   collapse are discussed.}},

Title = {{Pore-Scale Joint Evaluation of Dielectric Permittivity and Electrical
   Resistivity for Assessment of Hydrocarbon Saturation Using Numerical
   Simulations}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Complex pore geometry and composition, as well as anisotropic behavior
   and heterogeneity, can affect physical properties of rocks such as
   electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity. The aforementioned
   physical properties are used to estimate in-situ petrophysical
   properties of the formation such as hydrocarbon saturation. In the
   application of conventional methods for interpretation of
   electrical-resistivity (e.g., Archie's equation and the dual-water
   model) and dielectric-permittivity measurements {[}e.g., complex
   refractive index model (CRIM)], the impacts of complex pore structure
   (e.g., kerogen porosity and intergranular pores), pyrite, and conductive
   mature kerogen have not been taken into account. These limitations cause
   significant uncertainty in estimates of water saturation. In this paper,
   we introduce a new method that combines interpretation of
   dielectric-permittivity and electrical-resistivity measurements to
   improve assessment of hydrocarbon saturation. The combined
   interpretation of dielectricpermittivity and electrical-resistivity
   measurements enables assimilating spatial distribution of rock
   components (e.g., pore, kerogen, and pyrite networks) in conventional
   models.
   We start with pore-scale numerical simulations of electrical resistivity
   and dielectric permittivity of fluid-bearing porous media to investigate
   the structure of pore and matrix constituents in these measurements. The
   inputs to these simulators are 3D pore-scale images. We then introduce
   an analytical model that combines resistivity and permittivity
   measurements to assess water-filled porosity and hydrocarbon saturation.
   We apply the new method to actual digital sandstones and synthetic
   digital organic-rich mudrock samples. The relative errors (compared with
   actual values estimated from image processing) in the estimate of
   water-filled porosity through our new method are all within the 10\%
   range. In the case of digital sandstone samples, CRIM provided
   reasonable estimates of water-filled porosity, with only four out of
   twenty-one estimates beyond 10\% relative error, with the maximum error
   of 30\%. However, in the case of synthetic digital organic-rich
   mudrocks, six out of ten estimates for water-filled porosity were beyond
   10\% with CRIM, with the maximum error of 40\%. Therefore, the
   improvement was more significant in the case of organic-rich mudrocks
   with complex pore structure. In the case of synthetic digital
   organic-rich mudrock samples, our simulation results confirm that not
   only the pore structure but also spatial distribution and tortuosity of
   water, kerogen, and pyrite networks affect the measurements of
   dielectric permittivity and electrical resistivity. Taking into account
   these parameters through the joint interpretation of
   dielectric-permittivity and electrical-resistivity measurements
   significantly improves assessment of hydrocarbon saturation.}},

   Accuracy for Nanomanufacturing and Nanometrology Applications}},
Journal = {{Journal of Micro and Nano-Manufacturing}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a low-cost, automated wafer alignment system
   capable of submicron wafer positioning repeatability. Accurate wafer
   alignment is critical in a number of nanomanufacturing and nanometrology
   applications where it is necessary to be able to overlay patterns
   between fabrication steps or measure the same spot on a wafer over and
   over again throughout the manufacturing process. The system presented in
   this paper was designed to support high-throughput nanoscale metrology
   where the goal is to be able to rapidly and consistently measure the
   same features on all the wafers in a wafer carrier without the need for
   slow and expensive vision-based alignment systems to find and measure
   the desired features. The wafer alignment system demonstrated in this
   paper consists of a three-pin passive wafer alignment stage, a voice
   coil actuated nesting force applicator, a three degrees-of-freedom
   (DOFs) wafer handling robot, and a wafer cassette. In this system, the
   wafer handling robot takes a wafer from the wafer cassette and loads it
   on to the wafer alignment stage. The voice coil actuator is then used to
   load the wafer against the three pins in the wafer alignment system and
   align the wafer to an atomic force microscope (AFM)-based metrology
   system. This simple system is able to achieve a throughput of 60
   wafers/h with a positional alignment repeatability of 283 nm in the
   x-direction, 530 nm in the y-direction, and 398 nm in the z-direction
   for a total capital cost of less than \$1800.}},

Title = {{Predicting the Specific Energy Consumption of Reverse Osmosis
   Desalination}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Desalination is often considered an approach for mitigating water
   stress. Despite the abundance of saline water worldwide, additional
   energy consumption and increased costs present barriers to widespread
   deployment of desalination as a municipal water supply. Specific energy
   consumption (SEC) is a common measure of the energy use in desalination
   processes, and depends on many operational and water quality factors. We
   completed multiple linear regression and relative importance statistical
   analyses of factors affecting SEC using both small-scale meta-data and
   municipal-scale empirical data to predict the energy consumption of
   desalination. Statistically significant results show water quality and
   initial year of operations to be significant and important factors in
   estimating SEC, explaining over 80\% of the variation in SEC. More
   recent initial year of operations, lower salinity raw water, and higher
   salinity product water accurately predict lower values of SEC. Economic
   analysis revealed a weak statistical relationship between SEC and cost
   of water production. Analysis of associated greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions revealed important considerations of both electricity source
   and SEC in estimating the GHG-related sustainability of desalination.
   Results of our statistical analyses can aid decision-makers by
   predicting the SEC of desalination to a reasonable degree of accuracy
   with limited data.}},

Title = {{Non-human Primate Schlafen11 Inhibits Production of Both Host and Viral
   Proteins}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Schlafen11 (encoded by the SLFN11 gene) has been shown to inhibit the
   accumulation of HIV-1 proteins. We show that the SLFN11 gene is under
   positive selection in simian primates and is species-specific in its
   activity against HIV-1. The activity of human Schlafen11 is relatively
   weak compared to that of some other primate versions of this protein,
   with the versions encoded by chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, and marmoset
   being particularly potent inhibitors of HIV-1 protein production.
   Interestingly, we find that Schlafen11 is functional in the absence of
   infection and reduces protein production from certain non-viral (GFP)
   and even host (Vinculin and GAPDH) transcripts. This suggests that
   Schlafen11 may just generally block protein production from non-codon
   optimized transcripts. Because Schlafen11 is an interferon-stimulated
   gene with a broad ability to inhibit protein production from many host
   and viral transcripts, its role may be to create a general antiviral
   state in the cell. Interestingly, the strong inhibitors such as marmoset
   Schlafen11 consistently block protein production better than weak
   primate Schlafen11 proteins, regardless of the virus or host target
   being analyzed. Further, we show that the residues to which
   species-specific differences in Schlafen11 potency map are distinct from
   residues that have been targeted by positive selection. We speculate
   that the positive selection of SLFN11 could have been driven by a number
   of different factors, including interaction with one or more viral
   antagonists that have yet to be identified.}},

Abstract = {{Patterned arrays of graphene nanostructures, also referred as graphene
   metasurfaces, have proven to be capable of efficiently coupling with
   incident light by surface plasmon resonances. In this work, a new type
   of graphene metasurfaces with moire patterns using cost-effective and
   scalable moire nanosphere lithography (MNSL) is demonstrated. A large
   gradient in feature size (i.e., from sub-200 nm to 1.1 mu m) of the
   graphene nanostructures exists in single metasurfaces. The in-plane
   quasi-periodic arrangement of the graphene nanostructures can be easily
   tuned to form a variety of moire patterns. The experimental measurement
   and numerical simulations show that the graphene moire metasurfaces
   support tunable and multiband optical responses due the size and shape
   dependences of surface plasmon resonance modes of graphene
   nanostructures. It is also demonstrated that the multiband optical
   responses of graphene moire metasurfaces can be tuned from mid-infrared
   (MIR) to terahertz (THz) regimes by choosing polystyrene spheres of
   different sizes for MNSL. These findings provide a cost-effective and
   scalable strategy to achieve ultrathin functional devices, including
   multiband light modulators, broadband biosensors, and multiband
   photodetectors, which feature tunable and multiband responses in wide
   range of wavelengths from MIR to THz.}},

Title = {{Geothermal exploitation from depleted high temperature gas reservoirs
   via recycling supercritical CO2: Heat mining rate and salt precipitation
   effects}},

Abstract = {{The geothermal energy in depleted high temperature gas reservoirs can be
   developed using existing wells and surface facilities via recycling
   water or supercritical CO2 after natural gas production. For a typical
   medium-size gas field, the recoverable geothermal energy can be
   equivalent to over 10 million tons of standard coal. The injection of
   CO2 can improve the heat mining rate, and it can also enhance gas
   recovery at the early stage of the process and achieve geological
   storage of CO2. However, a big concern in the injection of CO2 is the
   salt precipitation induced by the interactions between the injected CO2
   and the formation water, which might cause reservoir damage and
   subsequently affect the flow behavior and the heat mining rate. In this
   paper, a comprehensive model of geothermal exploitation from gas
   reservoirs via CO2 injection was established, in which the processes of
   formation water evaporation, salt dissolution and precipitation, and
   their effects on formation porosity and permeability were incorporated.
   The influences of various parameters on geothermal recovery and salt
   precipitation were investigated by using this model, including the
   saturation and salinity of formation waters, injection-production
   pressure difference, and the permeability and porosity of the gas
   reservoirs. The results show that, for the gas reservoir studied at a
   temperature of 130 degrees C (i.e. with a volume of 1000 m x 500 m x 50
   m), the heat mining rate of one injector-producer pair can be maintained
   at about 5 MW with a CO2 recycling rate of 3000 t/day for 30 years. The
   effect of salt precipitation is moderate, and it is dependent on the
   reservoir conditions. Especially, salt precipitation occurs severely in
   the near well region when the remaining water saturation is higher than
   the irreducible water saturation. Meanwhile, water evaporation induced
   by CO2 injection may cause a back flow of formation water due to the
   effects of gravity and capillarity, which can intensify the evaporation
   and increase the salt precipitation and enrichment in the region. This
   can cause a reduction of permeability which therefore decreases the heat
   mining rate. Different methods for reducing salt precipitation was
   proposed and evaluated accordingly, including injection of low salinity
   water prior to CO2 injection and co-injection of CO2 and fresh water.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Central carbon metabolism is conserved among all organisms for cellular
   function and energy generation. The connectivity of this metabolic map
   gives rises to key metabolite nodes. Five of these nodes in particular,
   pyruvate, citric acid, tyrosine and aspartate, acetyl-CoA, serve as
   critical starting points for the generation of a broad class of relevant
   chemical molecules with ranging applications from fuels, pharmaceuticals
   and polymer precursors. This review highlights recent progress in
   converting these metabolite nodes into valuable products. In particular,
   acetyl-CoA, the most well-connected node, serves as the building block
   for several classes of molecules including fatty acids and terpenes.
   Systematic metabolic engineering efforts focused on these metabolic
   building blocks has enabled the production of industrially-relevant,
   biobased compounds.}},

Abstract = {{As driving becomes more automated, vehicles are being equipped with more
   sensors generating even higher data rates. Radars are used for object
   detection, visual cameras as virtual mirrors, and LIDARs for generating
   high resolution depth associated range maps, all to enhance the safety
   and efficiency of driving. Connected vehicles can use wireless
   communication to exchange sensor data, allowing them to enlarge their
   sensing range and improve automated driving functions. Unfortunately,
   conventional technologies, such as DSRC and 4G cellular communication,
   do not support the gigabit-per-second data rates that would be required
   for raw sensor data exchange between vehicles. This article makes the
   case that mmWave communication is the only viable approach for high
   bandwidth connected vehicles. The motivations and challenges associated
   with using mmWave for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure
   applications are highlighted. A high-level solution to one key challenge
   - the overhead of mmWave beam training - is proposed. The critical
   feature of this solution is to leverage information derived from the
   sensors or DSRC as side information for the mmWave communication link
   configuration. Examples and simulation results show that the beam
   alignment overhead can be reduced by using position information obtained
   from DSRC.}},

Abstract = {{Petabyte-scale distributed storage systems are currently transitioning
   to erasure codes to achieve higher storage efficiency. Classical codes,
   such as Reed-Solomon (RS), are highly sub-optimal for distributed
   environments due to their high overhead during single-failure events.
   Locally repairable codes (LRCs) form a new family of codes that are
   repair efficient. In particular, LRCs minimize the number of nodes
   participating in single node repairs. Fundamental bounds and methods for
   explicitly constructing LRCs suitable for deployment in distributed
   storage clusters are not fully understood and currently form an active
   area of research. In this paper, we present an explicit LRC that is
   simple to construct and is optimal for a specific set of coding
   parameters. Our construction is based on grouping RS symbols and then
   adding extra simple parities that allow for small repair locality. For
   the analysis of the optimality of the code, we derive a new result on
   the matroid represented by the code's generator matrix.}},

Title = {{Reynolds number and geometry effects in laminar axisymmetric isothermal
   counterflows}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The counterflow configuration is a canonical stagnation flow, featuring
   two opposed impinging round jets and a mixing layer across the
   stagnation plane. Although counterflows are used extensively in the
   study of reactive mixtures and other applications where mixing of two
   streams is required, quantitative data on the scaling properties of the
   flow field are lacking. The aim of this work is to characterize the
   velocity and mixing fields in isothermal counterflows over a wide range
   of conditions. The study features both experimental data from particle
   image velocimetry and results from detailed axisymmetric simulations.
   The scaling laws for the nondimensional velocity and mixture fraction
   are obtained as a function of an appropriate Reynolds number and the
   ratio of the separation distance of the nozzles to their diameter. In
   the range of flow configurations investigated, the nondimensional fields
   are found to depend primarily on the separation ratio and, to a lesser
   extent, the Reynolds number. The marked dependence of the velocity field
   with respect to the separation ratio is linked to a high pressure region
   at the stagnation point. On the other hand, Reynolds number effects
   highlight the role played by the wall boundary layer on the interior of
   the nozzles, which becomes less important as the separation ratio
   decreases. The normalized strain rate and scalar dissipation rate at the
   stagnation plane are found to attain limiting values only for high
   values of the Reynolds number. These asymptotic values depend markedly
   on the separation ratio and differ significantly from the values
   produced by analytical models. The scaling of the mixing field does not
   show a limiting behavior as the separation ratio decreases to the
   smallest practical value considered. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Mitral valve leaflet remodelling during pregnancy: insights into
   cell-mediated recovery of tissue homeostasis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{125}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about how valvular tissues grow and remodel in response
   to altered loading. In this work, we used the pregnancy state to
   represent a non-pathological cardiac volume overload that distends the
   mitral valve (MV), using both extant and new experimental data and a
   modified form of our MV structural constitutive model. We determined
   that there was an initial period of permanent set-like deformation where
   no remodelling occurs, followed by a remodelling phase that resulted in
   near-complete restoration of homeostatic tissue-level behaviour. In
   addition, we observed that changes in the underlying MV interstitial
   cell (MVIC) geometry closely paralleled the tissue-level remodelling
   events, undergoing an initial passive perturbation followed by a gradual
   recovery to the pre-pregnant state. Collectively, these results suggest
   that valvular remodelling is actively mediated by average MVIC
   deformations (i.e. not cycle to cycle, but over a period of weeks).
   Moreover, tissue-level remodelling is likely to be accomplished by
   serial and parallel additions of fibrillar material to restore the mean
   homeostatic fibre stress and MVIC geometries. This finding has
   significant implications in efforts to understand and predict MV growth
   and remodelling following such events as myocardial infarction and
   surgical repair, which also place the valve under altered loading
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Model Predictive Control of the Exit Part Temperature for an
   Austenitization Furnace}},
Journal = {{PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Quench hardening is the process of strengthening and hardening ferrous
   metals and alloys by heating the material to a specific temperature to
   form austenite (austenitization), followed by rapid cooling (quenching)
   in water, brine or oil to introduce a hardened phase called martensite.
   The material is then often tempered to increase toughness, as it may
   decrease from the quench hardening process. The austenitization process
   is highly energy-intensive and many of the industrial austenitization
   furnaces were built and equipped prior to the advent of advanced control
   strategies and thus use large, sub-optimal amounts of energy. The model
   computes the energy usage of the furnace and the part temperature
   profile as a function of time and position within the furnace under
   temperature feedback control. In this paper, the aforementioned model is
   used to simulate the furnace for a batch of forty parts under heuristic
   temperature set points suggested by the operators of the plant. A model
   predictive control (MPC) system is then developed and deployed to
   control the the part temperature at the furnace exit thereby preventing
   the parts from overheating. An energy efficiency gain of 5.3\% was
   obtained under model predictive control compared to operation under
   heuristic temperature set points tracked by a regulatory control layer.}},

Abstract = {{Thevenin's theorem is commonly used in the analysis of acoustic
   transducers to provide a simplified representation of a transducer or
   its environment. The method may be extended to the analyses of other
   acoustic systems, without limitation to systems that have been reduced
   to analogous circuit models, and is particularly convenient in the
   analysis of acoustic scattering when the scattering object is mobile. In
   this paper, the method is illustrated through an alternative derivation
   of the well-known ``mass law{''} for transmission through a partition,
   and is also applied to the case of acoustic scattering from a rigid,
   mobile cylinder of arbitrary size in an ideal plane progressive wave.
   Differences between the conventional solution approach for such problems
   and the Thevenin-inspired method are discussed, along with the potential
   benefits of taking such an approach for the simplification of other
   problems in physical acoustics. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses variability and accuracy of site response
   predictions performed using shear wave velocity (Vs) profiles derived
   from non-unique surface wave inversions and other commonly used
   statistical methods of accounting for epistemic uncertainty and aleatory
   variability in Vs. Specifically, linear and equivalent linear site
   response analyses were performed on the following three classes of Vs
   profiles: (1) 350 Vs profiles developed by performing multiple surface
   wave inversions, each with a unique set of layering parameters, on a
   common dispersion dataset, (2) two upper/lower range base-case Vs
   profiles developed by systematically increasing or decreasing the
   solution Vs profile by 20\%, and (3) 100 Vs profiles developed using the
   Vs randomization procedure proposed by Toro (1995) {[}26]. Vs profiles
   derived from surface wave inversions generally yielded accurate site
   response estimates with minimal variability, so long as their
   theoretical dispersion data fit the experimental dispersion data well.
   On the other hand, the upper/lower range and randomized Vs profiles
   generally produced inaccurate and highly variable site response
   predictions, although the inclusion of site-specific parameters in the
   randomization model improved the results. At real sites where
   substantial aleatory variability is anticipated and/or the epistemic
   uncertainty is quite high, the site response estimates associated with
   the randomized and/or upper/lower range Vs profiles may be deemed
   acceptable. However, if the experimental dispersion data and
   horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios are shown to be consistent over
   the footprint of a site, it may be possible to significantly reduce the
   uncertainty associated with the input Vs profile and the resulting
   uncertainty in the site response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper describes recent efforts that incorporate remote sensing
   techniques and platforms into geotechnical earthquake reconnaissance to
   document damage patterns, collect three-dimensional geometries of

   LIDAR), as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), are introduced and
   recent case histories of the use of these techniques in reconnaissance
   efforts are provided. These examples demonstrate the potential for
   remote sensing to improve our understanding of geotechnical effects both
   at a regional scale and at a local level. The use of remote sensing to
   measure ground movements is particularly noteworthy and has the
   potential to provide data sets that will improve our ability to
   quantitatively predict the consequences of liquefaction and landslides.

Abstract = {{Block copolymers (BCPs) have the potential to play a key role in
   templating materials for nanoscale synthesis. BCP lithography likely
   will be one of the first examples of BCP-based nanomanufacturing
   implemented in a production setting. One of the challenges in
   implementing BCP lithography is that the lamella need to be oriented
   perpendicular to the substrate. For many systems, this requires control
   over interfacial energies for both components at the substrate and
   interface. Top coats can be designed to provide a neutral interface for
   both blocks on the BCP surface. The preferentiality of the top coat as a
   function of composition has been determined qualitatively by examining
   the orientation of a BCP after annealing with a top coat. Measurements
   of the interfacial width between the top coat and homopolymers allows
   the interface energy to be quantitatively determined. Resonant soft
   X-ray reflectivity measurements on top coat/homopolymer pairs were used
   to extract the Flory-Huggins parameter (chi) and interface energy
   (gamma) as a function of top coat composition. The difference between
   chi and gamma for each top coat/homopolymer pair was minimized at
   compositions that resulted in the top coat promoting perpendicular
   orientation. As the composition moved away from the neutral point the
   difference between chi and gamma for each pair grew larger.}},

Abstract = {{In this Perspective, we discuss the physics and potential applications
   of planar hyperbolic metasurfaces (MTSs), with emphasis on their
   in-plane and near-field responses. After revisiting the governing
   dispersion relation and properties of the supported surface plasmon
   polaritons (SPPs), we discuss the different topologies that uniaxial
   MTSs can implement. Particular attention is devoted to the hyperbolic
   regime, which exhibits unusual features, such as an ideally infinite
   wave confinement and local density of states. In this context, we
   clarify the different physical mechanisms that limit the practical
   implementation of these ideal concepts using materials found in nature,
   and we describe several approaches to realize hyperbolic MTSs, ranging
   from the use of novel 2D materials such as black phosphorus to
   artificial nanostructured composites made of graphene or silver. Some
   exciting phenomena and applications are then presented and discussed,
   including negative refraction and the routing of SPPs within the
   surface, planar hyperlensing, dramatic enhancement and tailoring of the
   local density of states, and broadband super-Planckian thermal emission.
   We conclude by outlining our vision for the future of uniaxial MTSs and
   their potential impact for the development of nanophotonics, on-chip
   networks, sensing, imaging, and communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene exhibits many unusual elastic properties, making it an
   intriguing material for mechanical measurement and actuation at the
   quantum limit. We theoretically examine the viability of graphene for
   cavity optomechanics from near-infrared to terahertz wavelengths, fully
   taking into account its large optical absorption and dispersion. A large
   optomechanical coupling coefficient, on the same order of that observed
   in state-of-the-art optomechanical materials, can be realized in the
   mid-infrared spectrum with highly doped graphene, a high optical quality
   factor, and optimal positioning of graphene. Around 100 THz, the
   dispersive coupling coefficient reaches 180 MHz/nm and 500 MHz/nm in the
   resolved and unresolved sideband regimes, respectively. We find that
   predominantly dispersive coupling requires a high graphene Fermi level
   and mid-infrared excitation, while predominantly dissipative coupling
   favors a moderate graphene Fermi level and near-infrared excitation.}},

Abstract = {{We recently proposed a novel single-source integral equation (SSIE) for
   accurate broadband resistance and inductance extraction and current flow
   modeling in 2-D conductors. The new surface integral equation is
   advantageous compared with the traditional volume electric field
   integral equation (V-EFIE) used for the inductance extraction, since the
   unknown function is defined on the surface of conductors as opposed to
   the volumetric unknown current density in V-EFIE. The new SSIE is also
   more suitable for the solution of inductance extraction problems than
   the traditional surface integral equation formulations, as it features
   only a single unknown surface function as opposed to having the unknown
   equivalent electric and magnetic surface current densities. The new
   equation also features only the electric field Green's functions unlike
   the previously known SSIE formulations. The latter property makes the
   new SSIE equation particularly suitable to the inclusion of the
   multilayered substrate effect into the inductance extraction model. This
   paper describes the generalization of the new SSIE formulation to the
   case of transmission line models embedded into the multilayered lossy
   substrates. This paper also shows how the matrix sparsity in the method
   of moments discretization of the novel integral equation can be
   exploited to accelerate its numerical solution and reduce associated
   memory use. This sparsity arises due to the skin-effect-based
   attenuation of the fields in conductors' cross sections leading to
   vanishing levels of the matrix elements corresponding to the distant
   interactions. Typical examples of inductance extraction in complex
   interconnects situated in lossy substrate are considered to validate the
   proposed techniques against traditional approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Tailored designing of highly active electrocatalysts plays a key role in
   determining the overall electrochemical performance of metal-air
   batteries for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution
   reaction (OER). We report herein a facile agarose gel-mediated strategy
   for the selective electrodeposition of MnO2 and Co3O4 onto 3D porous
   nickel foam, in an attempt to produce a sectionalized MnO2-Co3O4
   electrode with low physical interference on catalytic function. The
   as-prepared agarose hydrogel with metal precursor ions allows the
   electrochemical deposition only onto the contact area between the gel
   and the substrate. The resulting electrodes are completely sectionalized
   by two different catalyst (MnO2 and Co3O4) coating layers within the 3D
   porous nickel foam. This novel structure enhances both the ORR/OER
   catalytic activities compared to those of bare metal oxide catalyst
   electrodes and even after 400 h of operation (equivalent to 100 cycles),
   the sectionalized MnO2-Co3O4 electrode shows excellent cycling
   performance and long-term stability in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. As
   such, this novel sectionalized electrode configuration has potential for
   wide applications in the fabrication of other electrode structures
   employing various metal oxides.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{240-263}},

Abstract = {{We develop an econometric framework for incorporating spatial dependence
   in integrated model systems of latent variables and multidimensional
   mixed data outcomes. The framework combines Bhat's Generalized
   Heterogeneous Data Model (GHDM) with a spatial (social) formulation to
   parsimoniously introduce spatial (social) dependencies through latent
   constructs. The applicability of the spatial GHDM framework is
   demonstrated through an empirical analysis of spatial dependencies in a
   multidimensional mixed data bundle comprising a variety of household
   choices - household commute distance, residential location (density)
   choice, vehicle ownership, parents' commute mode choice, and children's
   school mode choice - along with other measurement variables for two
   latent constructs - parent's safety concerns about children
   walking/biking to school and active lifestyle propensity. The GHDM
   framework identifies an intricate web of causal relationships and
   endogeneity among the endogenous variables. Furthermore, the spatial
   (social) version of the GHDM model reveals a high level of spatial
   (social) dependency in the latent active lifestyle propensity of
   different households and moderate level of spatial dependency in
   parents' safety concerns. Ignoring spatial (social) dependencies in the
   empirical model results in inferior data fit, potential bias and
   statistical insignificance of the parameters corresponding to nominal
   variables, and underestimation of policy impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Adoption of cells with a solid-state electrolyte is a promising solution
   for eliminating the polysulfide shuttle problem in Li-S batteries. Among
   the various known lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes, the sodium
   superionic conductor (NASICON)-type Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)(3) offers the
   advantage of good stability under ambient conditions and in contact with
   air. Accordingly, we present here a comprehensive assessment of the
   durability of Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)(3) in contact with polysulfide solution
   and in Li-S cells. Because of its high reduction potential (2.5 V vs
   Li/Li+), Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)(3) gets lithiated in contact with lithium
   polysulfide solution and Li2CO3 is formed on the particle surface,
   blocking the interfacial lithium-ion transport between the liquid and
   solid-state electrolytes. After the lithium insertion into the NASICON
   framework, the crystal expands in an anisotropic way, weakening the
   crystal bonds, causing fissures and resultant cracks in the ceramic,
   corroding the grain boundaries by polysulfide solution, and leaving
   unfavorable pores. The assembly of pores creates a gateway for
   polysulfide diffusion from the cathode side to the anode side, causing
   an abrupt decline in cell performance. Therefore, the solid-state
   electrolytes need to have good chemical compatibility with both the
   electrode and electrolyte, long-term stability under harsh chemical
   environment, and highly stable grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent advances in improving titers for therapeutic proteins
   such as antibodies to the 10 g/L scale, these high yields can only be
   achieved in select mammalian hosts. Regardless of the host or product,
   strong promoters are required to obtain high levels of transgene
   expression. However, the promoters employed to drive this expression are
   rather limited in variety and are usually either viral-derived or
   screened empirically during vector design. To begin to move away from
   viral parts, we employed a more systematic approach to identify and
   design new synthetic promoters using endogenous elements. To do so, we
   established a workflow to design these elements by (1) analyzing the
   transcriptomics profile of a specific cell line under a desired,
   representative cell culture condition, (2) identifying key genetic
   motifs using bioinformatics that can be used to rationally construct
   synthetic promoters, (3) building synthetic promoters using conventional
   DNA synthesis and molecular biology techniques, and (4) evaluating the
   performance of these synthetic promoters using model proteins. The
   resulting promoters perform comparably to the hCMV IE promoter variants
   tested, but with endogenous components. During this design-build-test
   cycle we also investigated the underlying design rules for transcription
   factor binding site arrangement in synthetic promoters. Overall, this
   approach of using an ``omics-guided{''} workflow for designing synthetic
   promoters facilitates the construction of high expression vectors for
   immediate use in current production hosts.}},

Abstract = {{The major thermal degradation pathway seen with
   1,5-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,1,3,3,5,5-hexamethyltrisiloxane/triethylene
   glycol (GAP-1/TEG) is the formation of a urea-containing compound.
   Degradation is increased at higher temperatures, longer reaction times,
   higher CO2 concentrations (in the form of carbamate loading), and low
   water levels. A judicious choice of operating conditions can
   significantly decrease urea byproduct formation. Reducing the desorption
   temperature from 140 to 100 degrees C and adding 5 wt \% water to the
   60:40 mixture of GAP-1/TEG resulted in a 500-fold reduction in amine
   loss after 4 days in a CO2-rich environment. After 56 days of continuous
   heating under the same conditions, similar to 87\% original GAP-1 was
   retained at 100 degrees C compared to only similar to 20\% at 140
   degrees C. The urea byproduct appears to be the only major degradation
   pathway under these conditions, with 100\% of the mass balance accounted
   for by the urea and amine components.}},

Abstract = {{Rabi splitting that arises from strong plasmon-molecule coupling has
   attracted tremendous interests. However, it has remained elusive to
   integrate Rabi splitting into the hybrid plasmon-waveguide modes
   (HPWMs), which have advantages of both subwavelength light confinement
   of surface plasmons and long-range propagation of guided modes in
   dielectric waveguides. Herein, we explore a new type of HPWMs based on
   hybrid systems of Al nanodisk arrays covered by PMMA thin films that are
   doped with photo chromic molecules and demonstrate the photoswitchable
   Rabi splitting with a maximum splitting energy of 572 meV in the HPWMs
   by controlling the photoisomerization of the molecules. Through our
   experimental measurements combined with finite difference time-domain
   (FDTD) simulations, we reveal that the photoswitchable Rabi splitting
   arises from the switchable coupling between the HPWMs and molecular
   excitons. By harnessing the photoswitchable Rabi splitting, we develop
   all-optical light modulators and rewritable waveguides. The
   demonstration of Rabi splitting in the HPWMs will further advance
   scientific research and device applications of hybrid plasmon-molecule
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{High electrical conductivity and large accessible surface area, which
   are required for ideal electrode materials of energy conversion and
   storage devices, are opposed to each other in current materials. It is a
   long-term goal to solve this issue. Herein, we report highly conductive
   porous Naembedded carbon (Na@C) nanowalls with large surface areas,
   which have been synthesized by an invented reaction of CO with liquid
   Na. Their electrical conductivities are 2 orders of magnitude larger
   than highly conductive 3D graphene. Furthermore, almost all their
   surface areas are accessible for electrolyte ions. These unique
   properties make them ideal electrode materials for energy devices, which
   significantly surpass expensive Pt. Consequently, the dye-sensitized
   solar cells (DSSCs) with the Na@C counter electrode has reached a high
   power conversion efficiency of 11.03\%. The Na@C also exhibited
   excellent performance for supercapacitors, leading to high capacitance
   of 145 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Energy conversion and storage systems with high efficiency have
   attracted great research interest in recent years. To improve the
   performance of energy devices, nanomaterials with delicately controlled
   structures and interfaces have been applied. However, low-dimensional
   nanomaterials suffer from inhomogeneous aggregation, severe re-stacking,
   and the formation of bottlenecks and poor contacts during the processing
   and assembly, thus hindering the transport of electrons or ions in
   energy devices. Gel materials, a special class of bio-inspired
   materials, are emerging as promising candidates to overcome the
   drawbacks of low-dimensional nanomaterials. The 3D nanostructured gel
   network promotes electron transport along the backbone while
   facilitating the diffusion of ions through hierarchical pores, as well
   as providing high surface area for interfacial reactions. In addition,
   the properties of gels can be facilely tuned, thereby further extending
   their applications and improving their performance.
   To date, various synthetic strategies have been developed for the
   preparation of gel materials, including carbon-based gels, conductive
   polymer gels, ionically conductive gels and inorganic gels. These gel
   materials have successfully served as electrode materials, electrolytes,
   self-supported current collectors, 3D binder systems, etc. in various
   kinds of energy conversion and storage applications, such as lithium ion
   batteries, supercapacitors, catalysts, and fuel cells. In this review,
   we summarize the synthesis of various electrically conductive gel
   materials, including carbon-based gels, conductive polymer gels, and
   ionically conductive gels and their applications in energy conversion
   and storage devices. We also provide the perspective on the future
   developments of these gel materials in energy-related fields. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to differentiate normal and scarred hamster
   cheek pouch samples by applying a quantitative image analysis technique
   for determining collagen fiber direction and density in second-harmonic
   generation microscopy images. This paper presents a collagen tissue
   analysis of scarred cheek pouches of four adult male Golden Syrian
   hamsters as an animal model for vocal fold scarring. One cheek pouch was
   scarred using an electrocautery unit and the other cheek was used as a
   control for each hamster. A home-built upright microscope and a compact
   ultrafast fiber laser were used to acquire depth resolved epi-collected
   second-harmonic generation images of collagen fibers. To quantify the
   average fiber direction and fiber density in each image, we applied
   two-dimensional Fourier analysis and intensity thresholding at five
   different locations for each control and scarred tissue sample,
   respectively. The resultant depth-resolved average fiber direction
   variance for scarred hamster cheek pouches (0.61 +/- 0.03) was
   significantly lower (p<0.05) than control tissue (0.73 +/- 0.04),
   indicating increased fiber alignment within the scar. Depth-resolved
   average voxel density measurements indicated scarred tissues contained
   greater (p<0.005) fiber density (0.72 +/- 0.09) compared to controls
   (0.18 +/- 0.03). In the present study, image analysis of both fiber
   alignment and density from depth-resolved second-harmonic generation
   images in epi-detection mode enabled the quantification of the increased
   collagen fiber deposition and alignment typically observed in fibrosis.
   The epi-detection geometry is the only viable method for in vivo imaging
   as well as imaging thick turbid tissues. These quantitative endpoints,
   clearly differentiating between control and scarred hamster cheek
   pouches, provide an objective means to characterize the extent of vocal
   fold scarring in vivo in preclinical and clinical research. In
   particular, this non-invasive method offers advantages for monitoring
   scar treatments in live animals and following the effects of
   scarring-related treatments such as application of steroids or drugs
   targeting pathways involved in fibrosis. SCANNING 38:684-693, 2016. (c)

Abstract = {{Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are often investigated as lower
   cost, more environmentally robust alternatives to natural recognitive
   biomolecules, such as antibodies. When synthesized on the surface of
   nanomaterial supports, MIPs are capable of quick and effective binding
   of macromolecular templates when compared to traditional bulk imprinted
   polymers. We have developed a method for imprinting proteins on
   biodegradable nanoparticle supports and have used these materials to
   investigate the impact of molecular imprinting on adsorption capacity
   and selectivity for lysozyme, the template protein. The imprinting
   process increased the adsorption capacity of the polymer for the
   template, lysozyme, with the MIPs being able to bind up to 83.5\% of
   their dry weight as compared to 55.7\% for nonimprinted polymers (NIPs).
   In noncompetitive binding experiments, where proteins were independently
   incubated with MIN, the difference between adsorption capacity for
   lysozyme and proteins with much lower isoelectric points (pI < 8.0) was
   statistically significant. However, there was no statistical difference
   between adsorption capacity for lysozyme and other high-isoelectric
   point proteins, suggesting that MIPs are semiselective for this class of
   proteins. In competitive binding experiments, both MIPs and NIPs
   preferentially bound lysozyme over other high-isoelectric point
   proteins. This result demonstrated that imprinting alone could not
   account for the observed selectivity for lysozyme. Analysis of the
   solvent accessible surface area of lysozyme and its high-isoelectric
   point competitors revealed why lysozyme is an exceptional binder to the
   polymer system used in this work, with or without imprinting.}},

Abstract = {{Capital project benchmarking requires an effective cost normalization
   process to achieve reasonable comparisons of cost-related performance
   for projects that are executed at different times and locations.
   Traditionally, cost normalization approaches were developed for ex post
   facto analysis of project performance and assume that all required
   information is fully available from a completed project. However,
   practitioners have expressed the need for cost normalization techniques
   to evaluate phase-level outcomes during ongoing projects. This paper
   aims to provide a cost normalization framework tailored to phase-based
   performance assessment. The framework involves three main steps:
   currency conversion, location adjustment, and time adjustment with
   considerations for various scenarios where the required information is
   not fully available. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate how the
   proposed cost normalization framework has been applied to phase-based
   performance assessment for capital projects. The proposed framework can
   benefit both researchers and industrial professionals interested in cost
   estimation, feasibility analysis, and performance assessment.}},

Abstract = {{The use of replacement heart valves continues to grow due to the
   increased prevalence of valvular heart disease resulting from an ageing
   population. Since bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) continue to be the
   preferred replacement valve, there continues to be a strong need to
   develop better and more reliable BHVs through and improved the general
   understanding of BHV failure mechanisms. The major technological hurdle
   for the lifespan of the BHV implant continues to be the durability of
   the constituent leaflet biomaterials, which if improved can lead to
   substantial clinical impact. In order to develop improved solutions for
   BHV biomaterials, it is critical to have a better understanding of the
   inherent biomechanical behaviors of the leaflet biomaterials, including
   chemical treatment technologies, the impact of repetitive mechanical
   loading, and the inherent failure modes. This review seeks to provide a
   comprehensive overview of these issues, with a focus on developing
   insight on the mechanisms of BHV function and failure. Additionally,
   this review provides a detailed summary of the computational
   biomechanical simulations that have been used to inform and develop a
   higher level of understanding of BHV tissues and their failure modes.
   Collectively, this information should serve as a tool not only to infer
   reliable and dependable prosthesis function, but also to instigate and
   facilitate the design of future bioprosthetic valves and clinically
   impact cardiology.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-field models have been a topic of much research in recent years.
   Results have shown that these models are able to produce complex crack
   patterns in both two and three dimensions. A number of extensions from
   brittle to ductile materials have been proposed and results are
   promising. To date, however, these extensions have not accurately
   represented strains after crack initiation or included important aspects
   of ductile fracture such as stress triaxiality. This work introduces a
   number of contributions to further develop phase-field models for
   fracture in ductile materials. These contributions include: a cubic
   degradation function that provides a stress strain response prior to
   crack initiation that more closely approximates linear elastic behavior,
   a derivation of the governing equations in terms of a general energy
   potential from balance laws that describe the kinematics of both the
   body and phase-field, introduction of a yield surface degradation
   function that provides a mechanism for plastic softening and corrects
   the non-physical elastic deformations after crack initiation, a proposed
   mechanism for including a measure of stress triaxiality as a driving
   force for crack initiation and propagation, and a correction to an error
   in the configuration update of an elastoplastic return-mapping algorithm
   for J(2) flow theory. We also present a heuristic time stepping scheme
   that facilitates computations that require a relatively long load time
   prior to crack initiation. A number of numerical results will be
   presented that demonstrate the effects of these contributions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a phase field model for proppant-filled
   fractures in a poroelastic medium. The formulation of the coupled system
   involves four unknowns: displacements, phase field, pressure, and
   proppant concentration. The two-field displacement phase-field system is
   solved fully-coupled and accounts for crack irreversibility. This
   solution is then coupled to the pressure equation via a fixed-stress
   iteration. The pressure is obtained by using a diffraction equation
   where the phase-field variable serves as an indicator function that
   distinguishes between the fracture and the reservoir. The transport of
   the proppant in the fracture is modeled by using a power-law fluid
   system. The numerical discretization in space is based on Galerkin
   finite elements for displacements and phase-field, and an enriched
   Galerkin method is applied for the pressure equation in order to obtain
   local mass conservation. The concentration is solved with cell-centered
   finite elements. Nonlinear equations are treated with Newton's method.
   Our developments are substantiated with several numerical examples in
   two and three dimensions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed averaging (also known as average consensus) is an algorithm
   that builds on neighbor to neighbor interactions with the ultimate goal
   of convergence to the average of all initial node values or to some
   value close to that average. We analyze in this paper the performance of
   distributed averaging algorithms where the information exchanged between
   neighboring agents is subject to deterministic uniform quantization
   (i.e., real values sent by nodes to their neighbors are truncated). With
   such quantization, convergence to the precise average cannot be achieved
   in general, but the convergence would be to some value close to it,
   called quantized consensus. Using Lyapunov stability analysis, we
   characterize the convergence properties of the resulting nonlinear
   quantized system. We show that in finite time and depending on initial
   conditions, the algorithm on any static and connected graph will either
   cause all agents to reach a quantized consensus where the consensus
   value is the largest quantized value not greater than the average of
   their initial values, or will lead all variables to oscillate in a small
   neighborhood around the average. In the latter case, we identify tight
   bounds for the size of the neighborhood and we further show that the
   error can be made arbitrarily small by adjusting the algorithm's
   parameters in a distributed manner.}},

   environmentally benign energy technologies. Due to the unique chemical
   and physical properties, 3-D nanostructure materials received particular
   attention for energy storage and conversion devices. However, the
   synthesis of 3-D nanosuperstructures (NSSs) remains a daunting task. In
   this mini review, we will discuss some recent achievements in rational
   and innovative approaches for fabricating NSSs assisted by designed
   catalysts both in aqueous solutions and vapor phases. Two types of 3-D
   NSSs are demonstrated; one is semiconductor ZnO, and the other is
   graphene/thin graphite, both of which show high crystallinity and
   controlled dimensions in 3-D. The obtained 3-D ZnO NSSs were applied for
   enhancing solar-assisted water oxidation efficiency, which offer 150\%
   improvement compared with simple nanowire arrays obtained at the same
   condition by using the commonly employed 0-D dot catalysts. The 3-D
   freestanding thin graphite with two levels of porosity was
   functionalized with thin nickel hydroxide nanoplates {[}Ni(OH)(2)] and
   applied as electrodes for alkaline batteries. The electrodes are
   binder-free and provide a remarkable discharge capacity of 480 mA h
   g(-1) at a rate of 1.5 A g(-1). Compared with previous reports, they
   also exhibit excellent cyclability with 97.5\% capacitance retention
   after 4000 cycles. The synthesis mechanism of 3-D superstructures could
   inspire the manufacturing of 3-D nanomaterials with high efficiency,
   large scales, and controllability.}},

Abstract = {{Whole-body operational space controllers (WBOSCs) are versatile and well
   suited for simultaneously controlling motion and force behaviors, which
   can enable sophisticated modes of locomotion and balance. In this paper,
   we formulate a WBOSC for point-foot bipeds with series-elastic actuators
   (SEA) and experiment with it using a teen-size SEA biped robot. Our main
   contributions are on devising a WBOSC strategy for point-foot bipedal
   robots, 2) formulating planning algorithms for achieving unsupported
   dynamic balancing on our point-foot biped robot and testing them using a
   WBOSC, and 3) formulating force feedback control of the internal
   forces-corresponding to the subset of contact forces that do not
   generate robot motions-to regulate contact interactions with the complex
   environment. We experimentally validate the efficacy of our new
   whole-body control and planning strategies via balancing over a
   disjointed terrain and attaining dynamic balance through continuous
   stepping without a mechanical support.}},

Abstract = {{In an on-chip silicon-organic hybrid electro-optic (EO) modulator, the
   mode overlap with EO materials, in-device effective r(33,) and
   propagation loss are among the most critical factors that determine the
   performance of the modulator. Various waveguide structures have been
   proposed to optimize these factors, yet there is a lack of comprehensive
   consideration on all of them. In this Letter, a one-dimensional (1D)
   photonic crystal (PC) slot waveguide structure is proposed that takes
   all these factors into consideration. The proposed structure takes
   advantage of the strong mode confinement within a low-index region in a
   conventional slot waveguide and the slow-light enhancement from the 1D
   PC structure. Its simple geometry makes it robust to resist fabrication
   imperfections and helps reduce the propagation loss. Using it as a phase
   shifter in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer structure, an integrated
   silicon-organic hybrid EO modulator was experimentally demonstrated. The
   observed effective EO coefficient is as high as 490 pm/V. The measured
   half-wave voltage and length product is less than 1 V.cm and can be
   further improved. A potential bandwidth of 61 GHz can be achieved and
   further improved by tailoring the doping profile. The proposed structure
   offers a competitive novel phase-shifter design, which is simple, highly
   efficient, and with low optical loss, for on-chip silicon-organic hybrid
   EO modulators. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{XFEM-Based CZM for the Simulation of 3D Multiple-Cluster Hydraulic
   Fracturing in Quasi-Brittle Shale Formations}},
Journal = {{ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4731-4748}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The cohesive zone model (CZM) honors the softening effects and plastic
   zone at the fracture tip in a quasi-brittle rock, e.g., shale, which
   results in a more precise fracture geometry and pumping pressure
   compared to those from linear elastic fracture mechanics. Nevertheless,
   this model, namely the planar CZM, assumes a predefined surface on which
   the fractures propagate and therefore restricts the fracture propagation
   direction. Notably, this direction depends on the stress interactions
   between closely spaced fractures and can be acquired by integrating CZM
   as the segmental contact interaction model with a fully coupled pore
   pressure-displacement model based on extended finite element method
   (XFEM). This integrated model, called XFEM-based CZM, simulates the
   fracture initiation and propagation along an arbitrary,
   solution-dependent path. In this work, we modeled a single stage of 3D
   hydraulic fracturing initiating from three perforation clusters in a
   single-layer, quasi-brittle shale formation using planar CZM and
   XFEM-based CZM including slit flow and poroelasticity for fracture and
   matrix spaces, respectively, in Abaqus. We restricted the XFEM
   enrichment zones to the stimulation regions as enriching the whole
   domain leads to extremely high computational expenses and unrealistic
   fracture growths around sharp edges. Moreover, we validated our
   numerical technique by comparing the solution for a single fracture with
   KGD solution and demonstrated several precautionary measures in using
   XFEM in Abaqus for faster solution convergence, for instance the initial
   fracture length and mesh refinement. We demonstrated the significance of
   the injection rate and stress contrast in fracture aperture, injection
   pressure, and the propagation direction. Moreover, we showed the effect
   of the stress distribution on fracture propagation direction comparing
   the triple-cluster fracturing results from planar CZM with those from
   XFEM-based CZM. We found that the stress shadowing effect of hydraulic
   fractures on each other can cause these fractures to coalesce, grow
   parallel, or diverge depending on cluster spacing. We investigated the
   effect of this arbitrary propagation direction on not only the
   fractures' length, aperture, and the required injection pressure, but
   also the fractures' connection to the wellbore. This connection can be
   disrupted due to the near-wellbore fracture closure which may embed
   proppant grains on the fracture wall or screen out the fracture at early
   times. Our results verified that the near-wellbore fracture closure
   strongly depends on the following: (1) the implemented model, planar or
   XFEM-based CZM; and (2) fracture cluster spacing. Ultimately, we
   proposed the best fracturing scenario and cluster spacing to maintain
   the fractures connected to the wellbore.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular understanding of serological immunity to influenza has been
   confounded by the complexity of the polyclonal antibody response in
   humans. Here we used high-resolution proteomics analysis of
   immunoglobulin (referred to as Ig-seq) coupled with high-throughput
   sequencing of transcripts encoding B cell receptors (BCR-seq) to
   quantitatively determine the antibody repertoire at the individual
   clonotype level in the sera of young adults before and after vaccination
   with trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. The serum repertoire
   comprised between 40 and 147 clonotypes that were specific to each of
   the three monovalent components of the trivalent influenza vaccine, with
   boosted pre-existing clonotypes accounting for similar to 60\% of the
   response. An unexpectedly high fraction of serum antibodies recognized
   both the H1 and H3 monovalent vaccines. Recombinant versions of these H1
   + H3 cross-reactive antibodies showed broad binding to hemagglutinins
   (HAs) from previously circulating virus strains; several of these
   antibodies, which were prevalent in the serum of multiple donors,
   recognized the same conserved epitope in the HA head domain. Although
   the HA-head-specific H1 + H3 antibodies did not show neutralization
   activity in vitro, they protected mice against infection with the H1N1
   and H3N2 virus strains when administered before or after challenge.
   Collectively, our data reveal unanticipated insights regarding the
   serological response to influenza vaccination and raise questions about
   the added benefits of using a quadrivalent vaccine instead of a
   trivalent vaccine.}},

Abstract = {{For broad protection against infection by viruses such as influenza or
   HIV, vaccines should elicit antibodies that bind conserved viral
   epitopes, such as the receptor-binding site (RBS). RBS-directed
   antibodies have been described for both HIV1-3 and influenza virus(4-8),
   and the design of immunogens to elicit them is a goal of vaccine
   research in both fields. Residues in the RBS of influenza virus
   hemagglutinin (HA) determine a preference for the avian or human
   receptor, alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid and alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid,
   respectively(9,10). Transmission of an avian-origin virus between humans
   generally requires one or more mutations in the sequences encoding the
   influenza virus RBS to change the preferred receptor from avian to
   human(9,11,12), but passage of a human-derived vaccine candidate in
   chicken eggs can select for reversion to avian receptor
   preference(13-15). For example, the X-181 strain of the 2009 new
   pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, derived from the A/California/07/2009
   isolate and used in essentially all vaccines since 2009, has arginine at
   position 226, a residue known to confer preference for an alpha-2,3
   linkage in H1 subtype viruses(13,14); the wild-type A/California/07/2009
   isolate, like most circulating human H1N1 viruses, has glutamine at
   position 226. We describe, from three different individuals,
   RBS-directed antibodies that recognize the avian-adapted H1 strain in
   current influenza vaccines but not the circulating new pandemic 2009
   virus; Arg226 in the vaccine-strain RBS accounts for the restriction.
   The polyclonal sera of the three donors also reflect this preference.
   Therefore, when vaccines produced from strains that are never passaged
   in avian cells become widely available, they may prove more capable of
   eliciting RBS-directed, broadly neutralizing antibodies than those
   produced from egg-adapted viruses, extending the established benefits of
   current seasonal influenza immunizations.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically study the lattice plasmon resonance structures, which
   are known as core/shell SiO2/Au nanocylinder arrays (NCAs), for
   high-performance, on-chip plasmonic sensors using the
   substrate-independent lattice plasmon modes (LPMs). Our
   finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal that new modes of
   localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) show up when the
   height-diameter aspect ratio of the NCAs is increased. The
   height-induced LSPRs couple with the superstrate diffraction orders to
   generate the substrate-independent LPMs. Moreover, we show that the high
   wavelength sensitivity and the narrow linewidth of the
   substrate-independent LPMs lead to the plasmonic sensors with high
   figure of merit (FOM) and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition,
   the plasmonic sensors are robust in asymmetric environments for a wide
   range of working wavelengths. Our further study of both far- and
   near-field electromagnetic distribution in the NCAs confirms the
   height-enabled tunability of the plasmonic ``hot spots{''} at the
   sub-nanoparticle resolution and the large field enhancement in the
   substrate-independent LPMs, which are responsible for the high FOM and
   SNR of the plasmonic sensors.}},

Title = {{Operations of a shared, autonomous, electric vehicle fleet: Implications
   of vehicle \& charging infrastructure decisions}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{243-254}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{There are natural synergies between shared autonomous vehicle (AV)
   fleets and electric vehicle (EV) technology, since fleets of AVs resolve
   the practical limitations of today's non-autonomous EVs, including
   traveler range anxiety, access to charging infrastructure, and charging
   time management. Fleet-managed AVs relieve such concerns, managing range
   and charging activities based on real-time trip demand and established
   charging station locations, as demonstrated in this paper. This work
   explores the management of a fleet of shared autonomous electric
   vehicles (SAEVs) in a regional, discrete-time, agent based model. The
   simulation examines the operation of SAEVs under various vehicle range
   and charging infrastructure scenarios in a gridded city modeled roughly
   after the densities of Austin, Texas.
   Results based on 2009 NHTS trip distance and time-of-day distributions
   indicate that fleet size is sensitive to battery recharge time and
   vehicle range, with each 80-mile range SAEV replacing 3.7 privately
   owned vehicles and each 200-mile range SAEV replacing 5.5 privately
   owned vehicles, under Level II (240-volt AC) charging. With Level III
   480-volt DC fast-charging infrastructure in place, these ratios rise to
   5.4 vehicles for the 80-mile range SAEV and 6.8 vehicles for the
   200-mile range SAEV. SAEVs can serve 96-98\% of trip requests with
   average wait times between 7 and 10 minutes per trip. However, due to
   the need to travel while ``empty{''} for charging and passenger pick-up,
   SAEV fleets are predicted to generate an additional 7.1-14.0\% of travel
   miles. Financial analysis suggests that the combined cost of charging
   infrastructure, vehicle capital and maintenance, electricity, insurance,
   and registration for a fleet of SAEVs ranges from \$0.42 to \$0.49 per
   occupied mile traveled, which implies SAEV service can be offered at the
   equivalent per-mile cost of private vehicle ownership for low-mileage
   households, and thus be competitive with current manually-driven
   carsharing services and significantly cheaper than on-demand
   driver-operated transportation services. When Austin-specific trip
   patterns (with more concentrated trip origins and destinations) are
   introduced in a final case study, the simulation predicts a decrease in
   fleet ``empty{''} vehicle-miles (down to 3-4\% of all SAEV travel) and
   average wait times (ranging from 2 to 4 minutes per trip), with each
   SAEV replacing 5-9 privately owned vehicles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Shelter construction for fish at the confluence of a river to avoid the
   effects of total dissolved gas supersaturation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{642-648}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation downstream has a negative
   environmental effect on fishes. It is caused by discharge from high dams
   and increases the incidence of gas bubble disease and fish mortality.
   Downstream of a high dam, there is an area with low TDG saturation due
   to the gradual mass exchange of gases between the separation zone and
   the mainstream and the long retention time in the confluence, which
   contributes to the dissipation of saturated TDG at the confluence of the
   mainstream and its tributaries. This area can provide a temporary
   shelter for fish to avoid the effects of TDG supersaturation during dam
   discharge. A depth-averaged, two-dimensional model of TDG dissipation at
   a river confluence was established. The concentration field was verified
   by a flume experiment. A numerical simulation of the TDG at the
   confluence of the Zumuzu River and its tributary, the Mozigou River, was
   conducted. The simulation showed that the convergence of the tributary,
   which had a low TDG saturation level, could reduce the TDG saturation
   level of the mainstream. However, the low-saturation area was not large
   enough for fish to avoid the negative effects of TDG saturation due to a
   sharp river slope and a large flow ratio between the mainstream and its
   tributary. To expand the suitable shelter area with low TDG
   supersaturation levels in order to provide a suitable shelter for fish,
   some engineering measures were explored, including the excavation of the
   riverbed and the construction of resistance obstacles. After the
   engineering measures were introduced, we observed a 30-fold increase in
   the size of the area with low TDG saturation, which was as high as 10005
   m(2) at 110\% of the TDG saturation. Combined with the comprehensive
   analyses of the flow velocity and the water depth, the confluence region
   was thought to be suitable to protect the fish from the effects of TDG
   supersaturation. This study provides an important reference for
   protecting fish during high dam discharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Natural scene statistics are well studied in the context of picture
   quality assessment and have been used in a wide variety of
   top-performing picture quality prediction models. Upscaling artifacts
   have been measured with regards to quality impairment using these kinds
   of models. However, the assessment and classification of subtle, less
   discriminable upscaling artifacts remains an unsolved problem. The
   nearly imperceptible artifacts pertaining to the extent and type of
   upscaling have not been predicted using natural scene statistics
   (NSS)based models. We develop an accurate model for predicting the
   upscaling ratio applied to any natural image. By decomposing an input
   image frame using an orthogonal filter bank and locally normalizing the
   resulting responses, we show that the local energy terms can be used to
   predict the upscaling ratio. In fact, a simple linear regressor can be
   trained on these energy measurements; hence, no hyperparameter tuning is
   necessary. We compare the proposed model with other no-reference models
   using real-world data contained in the Netflix collection.}},

Abstract = {{The microorganisms present in retail environments have not been studied
   in detail despite the fact that these environments represent a
   potentially important location for exposure. In this study, HVAC filter
   dust samples in 13 US retail stores were collected and analyzed via
   pyrosequencing to characterize the indoor bacterial communities and to
   explore potential relationships between these communities and building
   and environmental parameters. Although retail stores contained a diverse
   bacterial community of 788 unique genera, over half of the nearly 118K
   sequences were attributed to the Proteobacteria phylum. Streptophyta,
   Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were the most
   prevalent genera detected. The recovered indoor airborne microbial
   community was statistically associated with both human oral and skin
   microbiota, indicating occupants are important contributors, despite a
   relatively low occupant density per unit volume in retail stores.
   Bacteria generally associated with outdoor environments were present in
   the indoor communities with no obvious association with air exchange
   rate, even when considering relative abundance. No significant
   association was observed between the indoor bacterial community
   recovered and store location, store type, or season. However, predictive
   functional gene profiling showed significant associations between the
   indoor community and season. The microbiome recovered from multiple
   samples collected months apart from the same building varied
   significantly indicating that caution is warranted when trying to
   characterize the bacterial community with a single sampling event.}},

Abstract = {{The biologically relevant characteristics of particulate matter (PM) in
   homes are important to assessing human health. The concentration of
   particulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed in eight homes
   and was found to be lower inside (mean +/- s.e.=1.59 +/- 0.33nmol/m(3))
   than outside (2.35 +/- 0.57nmol/m(3)). Indoor particulate ROS
   concentrations were substantial and a major fraction of indoor
   particulate ROS existed on PM2.5 (58 +/- 10\%), which is important from
   a health perspective as PM2.5 can carry ROS deep into the lungs. No
   obvious relationships were evident between selected building
   characteristics and indoor particulate ROS concentrations, but this
   observation would need to be verified by larger, controlled studies.
   Controlled experiments conducted at a test house suggest that indoor
   ozone and terpene concentrations substantially influence indoor
   particulate ROS concentrations when outdoor ozone concentrations are
   low, but have a weaker influence on indoor particulate ROS
   concentrations when outdoor ozone concentrations are high. The
   combination of substantial indoor concentrations and the time spent
   indoors suggest that further work is warranted to assess the key
   parameters that drive indoor particulate ROS concentrations.}},

Title = {{Influence of pore water on the heat mining performance of supercritical
   CO2 injected for geothermal development}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CO2 UTILIZATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{287-300}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Utilization of supercritical CO2 as heat transmission fluid for
   geothermal development associated with geological storage can achieve
   the double wins of economic benefits and environmental protection. The
   advantages of supercritical CO2 in thermodynamics and injectivity have
   been recognized widely. The main concerns of this technology are focused
   on the water production process at the beginning of CO2 injection and
   the long-term complicated CO2-water-rock interactions in the geothermal
   reservoirs. These factors may significantly constrain the excellent heat
   mining performance of supercritical CO2, and lower the application
   potential of the technology. In this paper, the interactions between
   rocks and fluids in typical geothermal reservoirs and their effects on
   the heat mining performance of supercritical CO2 are studied based on an
   established reservoir simulation model. The development of different CO2
   seepage zones in the reservoir, and the relevant rock-fluid interactions
   in these zones are investigated. The negative influence of water
   production and the change of reservoir properties induced by rock-fluid
   interactions on the CO2 heat mining performance are also assessed. The
   simulation results indicate that both of the salt precipitation induced
   by pore water vaporization, and the geochemical reactions between CO2
   and rocks in the geothermal reservoir can damage the reservoir
   properties, especially serious salting out may occur around the
   production well and reduce the heat mining rate of CO2 significantly.
   Overall, the existing pore water can reduce more than 27\% of the
   cumulative mined heat as well as nearly 45\% of the heat mining rate
   after 40 years. Some measures, such as selecting reservoirs without
   water, and injecting fresh water, can be applied to mitigate the damage
   of pore water to CO2 heat mining performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Amorphous transition metal oxides are recognized as leading candidates
   for electrochromic window coatings that can dynamically modulate solar
   irradiation and improve building energy efficiency. However, their thin
   films are normally prepared by energy-intensive sputtering techniques or
   high-temperature solution methods, which increase manufacturing cost and
   complexity. Here, we report on a room-temperature solution process to
   fabricate electrochromic films of niobium oxide glass (NbOx) and
   `nanocrystal-in-glass' composites (that is, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)
   nanocrystals embedded in NbOx glass) via acid-catalysed condensation of
   polyniobate clusters. A combination of X-ray scattering and
   spectroscopic characterization with complementary simulations reveals
   that this strategy leads to a unique one-dimensional chain-like NbOx
   structure, which significantly enhances the electrochromic performance,
   compared to a typical three-dimensional NbOx network obtained from
   conventional high-temperature thermal processing. In addition, we show
   how self-assembled ITO-in-NbOx composite films can be successfully
   integrated into high-performance flexible electrochromic devices.}},

Abstract = {{With ever increasing network traffic rates, multicore architectures for
   network processors have successfully provided performance improvements
   through high parallelism. However, naively allocating the network
   traffic to multiple cores without considering diversified applications
   and flow locality results in issues such as packet reordering, load
   imbalance and inefficient cache usage. Consequently, these issues
   degrade the performance of latency sensitive network processors by
   dropping packets or delivering packets out of order. In this paper, we
   propose a packet scheduling scheme that considers the multiple
   dimensions of locality to improve the throughput of a network processor
   while minimizing out of order packets. Our scheduling policy tries to
   maintain packet order my maintaining the flow locality, minimizes the
   migration of flows from one core to another by identifying the
   aggressive flows, and partitions the cores among multiple services to
   gain instruction cache locality. Our light weight hardware
   implementation shows improvement of 60 percent in the number of packets
   dropped and 80 percent in the number of out-of-order packet deliveries
   over previously proposed techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Improving yeast tolerance to 1-butanol and isobutanol is a step toward
   enabling high-titer production. To identify previously unknown genetic
   targets leading to increased tolerance, we establish a tunable RNA
   interference (RNAi) screening approach. Specifically, we optimized the
   efficiency and tunability of RNA interference library screening in
   yeast, ultimately enabling downregulation efficiencies from 0 to 94 \%.
   Using this system, we identified the Hsp70 family as a key regulator of
   isobutanol tolerance in a single round of screening, with downregulation
   of these genes conferring up to 64 \% increased growth in 12 g/L
   isobutanol. For 1-butanol, we find through two rounds of iterative
   screening that the combined downregulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and
   enolase improves growth up to 3100 \% in 10 g/L 1-butanol. Collectively,
   this work improves the tunability of RNAi in yeast as demonstrated by
   the discovery of novel effectors for these complex phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity to co-transport glucose and xylose into yeast has remained
   a technical challenge in the field. While significant efforts have been
   made in transporter engineering to increase xylose transport rates,
   glucose-based inhibition still limit most of these transporters. To
   address this issue, we further engineer sugar transporter proteins to
   remove glucose inhibition and enable glucose/xylose co-transport.
   Specifically, we start with our previously derived CiGXS1 FIM mutant
   strain and subjugate it to several rounds of mutagenesis and selection
   in a hexose metabolism null strain. Through this effort, we identify
   several mutations including N326H, a truncation in the C-terminal tail,
   I171F, and M40V as additionally dominant for reducing glucose
   inhibition. The resulting transporter shows substantially improved
   xylose transport rates in the presence of high quantities of glucose
   including up to 70 g/L glucose. Moreover, the resulting transporter
   enables co-utilization of glucose and xylose with glucose rates on par
   with a wild-type transporter and xylose rates exceeding that of glucose.
   These results demonstrate that major facilitator superfamily hexose
   transporters can be rewired into glucose-xylose co-transporters without
   functional inhibition by either substrate. These results enhance the
   potential of using lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for yeast.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{334}},
Pages = {{179-190}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as an attractive
   electrochemical energy storage system due to the high theoretical
   capacity of sulfur (1,675 mA h g(-1)). However, high-loading sulfur
   cathodes would need to be employed for the Li-S cells to be practical,
   but the resulting poor cell cyclability and severe electrode degradation
   hamper their development. Here, we present a hierarchical sulfur cathode
   as a testing platform for understanding the high-loading capability of
   Li-S batteries. The hierarchical cathode presents good electrochemical
   utilization of above 70\%, stable cyclability for 500-1,000 cycles, and
   high sulfur loadings of 4.2-10.0 mg cm(-2). The exploration of the
   activation and the polysulfide-retention processes of the high-loading
   cathodes illustrates that the electrochemical stability mainly results
   from the stabilization of dissolved polysulfides within the cathode
   region as the electrochemically active catholyte. Therefore, the
   utilization of stabilized polysulfide migration might be a meaningful
   opportunity for designing high-loading cathodes and further improving
   their electrochemical stability and long-term cyclability. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The `value' of infinite horizon risk-sensitive control is the principal
   eigenvalue of a certain positive operator. For the case of compact
   domain, Chang has built upon a nonlinear version of the Krein-Rutman
   theorem to give a `min-max' characterization of this eigenvalue which
   may be viewed as a generalization of the classical Collatz-Wielandt
   formula for the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of a nonnegative irreducible
   matrix. We apply this formula to the Nisio semigroup associated with
   risk-sensitive control and derive a variational characterization of the
   optimal risk-sensitive cost. For the linear, i.e., uncontrolled case,
   this is seen to reduce to the celebrated Donsker-Varadhan formula for
   principal eigenvalue of a second-order elliptic operator.}},

Abstract = {{New directions in medical and biomedical sciences have gradually emerged
   over recent years that will change the way diseases are diagnosed and
   treated and are leading to the redirection of medicine toward
   patient-specific treatments. We refer to these new approaches for
   studying biomedical systems as predictive medicine, a new version of
   medical science that involves the use of advanced computer models of
   biomedical phenomena, high-performance computing, new experimental
   methods for model data calibration, modern imaging technologies,
   cutting-edge numerical algorithms for treating large stochastic systems,
   modern methods for model selection, calibration, validation,
   verification, and uncertainty quantification, and new approaches for
   drug design and delivery, all based on predictive models. The
   methodologies are designed to study events at multiple scales, from
   genetic data, to sub-cellular signaling mechanisms, to cell
   interactions, to tissue physics and chemistry, to organs in living human
   subjects. The present document surveys work on the development and
   implementation of predictive models of vascular tumor growth, covering
   aspects of what might be called modeling-and-experimentally based
   computational oncology. The work described is that of a
   multi-institutional team, centered at ICES with strong participation by
   members at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and University of Texas at San
   Antonio. This exposition covers topics on signaling models, cell and
   cell-interaction models, tissue models based on multi-species mixture
   theories, models of angiogenesis, and beginning work of drug effects. A
   number of new parallel computer codes for implementing finite-element
   methods, multi-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods, data
   classification methods, stochastic PDE solvers, statistical inverse
   algorithms for model calibration and validation, models of events at
   different spatial and temporal scales is presented. Importantly, new
   methods for model selection in the presence of uncertainties fundamental
   to predictive medical science, are described which are based on the
   notion of Bayesian model plausibilities. Also, as part of this general
   approach, new codes for determining the sensitivity of model outputs to
   variations in model parameters are described that provide a basis for
   assessing the importance of model parameters and controlling and
   reducing the number of relevant model parameters. Model specific data is
   to be accessible through careful and model-specific platforms in the
   Tumor Engineering Laboratory. We describe parallel computer platforms on
   which large-scale calculations are run as well as specific time-marching
   algorithms needed to treat stiff systems encountered in some phase-field
   mixture models. We also cover new non-invasive imaging and data
   classification methods that provide in vivo data for model validation.
   The study concludes with a brief discussion of future work and open
   challenges.}},

Abstract = {{To dynamically detect and characterize F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
   dose infiltrations and evaluate their effects on positron emission
   tomography (PET) standardized uptake values (SUV) at the injection site
   and in control tissue.
   Investigational gamma scintillation sensors were topically applied to
   patients with locally advanced breast cancer scheduled to undergo
   limited whole-body FDG-PET as part of an ongoing clinical study.
   Relative to the affected breast, sensors were placed on the
   contralateral injection arm and ipsilateral control arm during the
   resting uptake phase prior to each patient's PET scan. Time-activity
   curves (TACs) from the sensors were integrated at varying intervals
   (0-10, 0-20, 0-30, 0-40, and 30-40 min) post-FDG and the resulting areas
   under the curve (AUCs) were compared to SUVs obtained from PET.
   In cases of infiltration, observed in three sensor recordings (30 \%),
   the injection arm TAC shape varied depending on the extent and severity
   of infiltration. In two of these cases, TAC characteristics suggested
   the infiltration was partially resolving prior to image acquisition,
   although it was still apparent on subsequent PET. Areas under the TAC
   0-10 and 0-20 min post-FDG were significantly different in infiltrated
   versus non-infiltrated cases (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05). When normalized
   to control, all TAC integration intervals from the injection arm were
   significantly correlated with SUVpeak and SUVmax measured over the
   infiltration site (Spearman rho aeyen 0.77, p < 0.05). Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, testing the ability of the
   first 10 min of post-FDG sensor data to predict infiltration visibility
   on the ensuing PET, yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.92.
   Topical sensors applied near the injection site provide dynamic
   information from the time of FDG administration through the uptake
   period and may be useful in detecting infiltrations regardless of PET
   image field of view. This dynamic information may also complement the
   static PET image to better characterize the true extent of
   infiltrations.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of negative gas SF6 admixture on the stability of
   low-pressure beam-driven discharge is studied by self-consistent 1D
   particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions model. We find that the plasma
   parameters as well as its stability are changed drastically when SF6 is
   added to argon gas. In an electropositive plasma we obtain the
   excitation of both fast and slow electrostatic plasma waves which is
   explained by the propagation of electron beam through the
   non-homogeneous bounded plasma. These waves lead to the heating of
   plasma electrons and ions. On the other hand, in electronegative plasma
   we also obtain a decay of the electron beam. However, since in
   electronegative beam-generated plasma the electron plasma density is
   homogeneous the beam is more stable. As a consequence, we obtain only
   the excitation of two fast electrostatic waves. One wave is excited due
   to two-stream instability and another wave is excited due to beam decay.
   The excitation of these fast waves does not influence the plasma
   homogeneity but influences the heating of plasma electrons.}},

Abstract = {{To detect the layout of color yarns automatically, a novel
   projection-based fabric segmentation method is proposed to segment the
   double-system-melange color fabric into several regions, which can be
   seen as single-system-melange color fabrics. This method consists of
   five main steps: (1) yarn skew detection, (2) fabric image projecting,
   (3) projection curve smoothing, (4) variance curve calculating, and (5)
   curve peak confirmation. Based on the acquisition fabric image, the skew
   angles of warp and weft yarns are detected by Hough transform first. The
   projection curves of L, a, and b channels in Lab color model are
   generated and smoothed by Savitzky-Golay filter. The variance curves of
   L, a, and b are then calculated, and the peaks corresponding to the
   regional boundaries in each curve are detected. The regional boundaries
   are confirmed by synthesizing the curve peaks of L, a, and b. The
   experimental and theoretical analysis proves that the proposed method
   can segment the double-system-melange color fabric into regions with
   satisfactory accuracy and good robustness. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {{A comparison of time-reversal and inverse-source methods for the optimal
   delivery of wave energy to subsurface targets}},
Journal = {{WAVE MOTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{121-140}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Elastic wave stimulation of targets embedded in heterogeneous elastic
   solids has potential applications in medicine (treatment of tumors,
   lithotripsy), petroleum engineering, environmental engineering,
   hydro-geology, etc. Systematic methodologies for designing the wave
   sources that focus optimally the emitted energy into the target zone are
   important for ensuring the efficiency of the wave energy delivery
   process. In this article, we compare two methodologies that could be
   used for designing wave sources that maximize wave based stimulation of
   the target region: a time-reversal (TR) approach and an inverse-source
   (IS) approach. The former relies on the linearity and reciprocity
   admitted by the governing physics, and the latter is an
   optimization-based framework that attempts maximization of a wave motion
   metric in the target zone. Whereas closed cavity problems are easier to
   treat, here we concentrate on the challenging problem of wave energy
   focusing to subsurface geo-formations using motion actuators placed on
   the ground surface. We formulate the underlying wave propagation problem
   for two-dimensional, semi-infinite, elastic, heterogeneous domains. We
   define motion metrics to measure the energy expended by the wave
   sources, and the kinetic energy delivered to the target formation. We
   conduct numerical experiments and compare the relative performance of
   the wave sources designed using the TR and the IS approaches. Both
   methods have advantages and disadvantages: for remote targets in
   well-characterized formations IS is preferred; whereas TR is preferable
   when a source can be embedded in the target. Both methods have similar
   efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Current protein replacement therapies for hemophilia B, a genetic
   bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in coagulation factor IX, rely
   on IV injections and infusions. Oral delivery of factor IX is a
   desirable needle-free option, especially for prophylaxis. We have
   developed a biodegradable, pH-responsive hydrogel microcarrier system
   based on the poly(methacrylic acid)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol)
   {[}P(MAA-g-EG)]. Incorporation of an enzymatically degradable peptide
   crosslinking agent allows for site-specific degradation by trypsin in
   the small intestine. P(MAA-g-EG) polymer was synthesized by UV
   polymerization, and then subsequently crosslinked with peptide
   crosslinking agent using EDC-NHS chemistry. Physical characterization
   included FTIR for determining the composition of the peptide crosslinked
   polymer and SEM for microparticle morphology. The pH-responsive swelling
   and enzyme-specific degradation were confirmed by bright-field
   microscopy and the corresponding kinetics were determined by
   turbidimetric measurements. Evaluating the drug delivery application of
   this degradable system, factor IX release studies showed site-specific
   release, and in vitro transport studies resulted in improved factor IX
   absorption. Incorporation of the degradable crosslinking agent
   significantly improved the delivery potential as compared to previously
   reported non-degradable drug delivery systems. Using this degradable
   P(MAA-g-EG) system as a delivery vehicle for factor IX can possibly lead
   to an orally administered prophylactic treatment for hemophilia B
   patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, mathematical modeling and simulation of diseases and their
   treatments have enabled the prediction of clinical outcomes and the
   design of optimal therapies on a personalized (i.e., patient-specific)
   basis. This new trend in medical research has been termed ``predictive
   medicine.{''} Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major health problem and an
   ideal candidate to explore tissue-scale, personalized modeling of cancer
   growth for two main reasons: First, it is a small organ, and, second,
   tumor growth can be estimated by measuring serum prostate-specific
   antigen (PSA, a PCa biomarker in blood), which may enable in vivo
   validation. In this paper, we present a simple continuous model that
   reproduces the growth patterns of PCa. We use the phase-field method to
   account for the transformation of healthy cells to cancer cells and use
   diffusion-reaction equations to compute nutrient consumption and PSA
   production. To accurately and efficiently compute tumor growth, our
   simulations leverage isogeometric analysis (IGA). Our model is shown to
   reproduce a known shape instability from a spheroidal pattern to
   fingered growth. Results of our computations indicate that such shift is
   a tumor response to escape starvation, hypoxia, and, eventually,
   necrosis. Thus, branching enables the tumor to minimize the distance
   from inner cells to external nutrients, contributing to cancer survival
   and further development. We have also used our model to perform
   tissue-scale, personalized simulation of a PCa patient, based on
   prostatic anatomy extracted from computed tomography images. This
   simulation shows tumor progression similar to that seen in clinical
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{The selective partitioning of lipid components in phase-separated
   membranes is essential for domain formation involved in cellular
   processes. Identifying and tracking the movement of lipids in cellular
   systems would be improved if we understood how to achieve selective
   affinity between fluorophore-labeled lipids and membrane assemblies.
   Here, we investigated the structure and chemistry of membrane lipids to
   evaluate lipid designs that partition to the liquid ordered (L-o) phase.
   A range of fluorophores at the headgroup position and lengths of PEG
   spacer between the lipid backbone and fluorophore were examined. On a
   lipid body with saturated palmityl or palmitoyl tails, we found that
   although the lipid tails can direct selective partitioning to the L-o
   phase through favorable packing interactions, headgroup hydrophobicity
   can override the partitioning behavior and direct the lipid to the
   disordered membrane phase (L-d). The PEG spacer can serve as a buffer to
   mute headgroup-membrane interactions and thus improve L-o phase
   partitioning, but its effect is limited with strongly hydrophobic
   fluorophore headgroups. We present a series of lipid designs leading to
   the development of novel fluorescently labeled lipids with selective
   affinity for the L-o phase.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Nonreciprocal components, such as isolators and circulators, provide
   highly desirable functionalities for optical circuitry. This motivates
   the active investigation of mechanisms that break reciprocity, and pose
   alternatives to magneto-optic effects in on-chip systems. In this work,
   we use optomechanical interactions to strongly break reciprocity in a
   compact system. We derive minimal requirements to create nonreciprocity
   in a wide class of systems that couple two optical modes to a mechanical
   mode, highlighting the importance of optically biasing the modes at a
   controlled phase difference. We realize these principles in a silica
   microtoroid optomechanical resonator and use quantitative heterodyne
   spectroscopy to demonstrate up to 10 dB optical isolation at telecom
   wavelengths. We show that nonreciprocal transmission is preserved for
   nondegenerate modes, and demonstrate nonreciprocal parametric
   amplification. These results open a route to exploiting various
   nonreciprocal effects in optomechanical systems in different
   electromagnetic and mechanical frequency regimes, including

Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Exploiting the appealing features of the mantle cloaking approach, we
   propose a general procedure that allows designing Yagi-Uda antennas with
   low scattering profile. The proposed radiators are able to operate
   efficiently within a given frequency band, while being
   electromagnetically undetectable in another desired frequency range. The
   general design procedure of such cloaked antennas is first presented,
   considering that both antenna and cloak requirements must be
   simultaneously fulfilled. Then, we prove that a cloaked Yagi-Uda antenna
   can be installed in close proximity to other radiators without affecting
   their performance. Due to these unprecedented characteristics, the
   proposed radiators may have a strong impact in the design of compact
   overcrowded platforms for both terrestrial and satellite applications.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, a theoretical analysis of gas sorption, based on the
   nonequilibrium lattice fluid (NELF) model, in chemically imidized
   HAB-6FDA polyimide and its thermally rearranged analogues is presented.
   Because of the inaccessibility of pVT data in the rubbery region, the
   characteristic lattice fluid parameters of the polymers considered in
   this study were obtained from a collection of infinite dilution
   solubility data at multiple temperatures. Hydrogen, nitrogen, and
   methane sorption isotherms at 35 degrees C were fit to the NELF model
   using one adjustable parameter, i.e., the polymer-penetrant binary
   interaction parameter, k(12). The optimal value of k(12) for each
   polymer-penetrant pair was used to predict hydrogen, nitrogen, and
   methane sorption isotherms at other temperatures and at pressures up to
   6 MPa. For carbon dioxide, a second adjustable parameter, the swelling
   coefficient, was introduced to account for sorption-induced matrix
   dilation. The ideal solubility-selectivity increase in gas sorption in
   thermally rearranged samples relative to their polyimide precursor is
   essentially due to entropic effects, i.e., to the increase in
   nonequilibrium fractional free volume during thermal rearrangement.}},

Title = {{Capacity and absorption rate of tertiary and hindered amines blended

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{397-404}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Aqueous piperazine (PZ) blended with a tertiary or hindered amine
   combines the high CO2 capacity of the tertiary or hindered amine with
   the fast rate of PZ. For flue gas CO2 capture, the optimum pK(a) (that
   which offers the highest CO2 cyclic capacity) of a mono-tertiary amine
   blended with PZ is 9.1. A generic Aspen Plus (R) model for PZ/tertiary
   amine was developed to predict the CO2 vapor-liquid-equilibrium (VLE)
   from the pK(a) of the tertiary amine. The polarity of the tertiary amine
   also affects the CO2 solubility of the PZ/tertiary amine. Hindered
   amines that form little carbamate show similar CO2 VLE to tertiary
   amines with the same pK(a), when blended with PZ. The CO2 absorption
   rate of most 2.5 m PZ/2.5 m tertiary amines was slightly slower than 2.5
   m PZ, probably due to the higher viscosity of the blends. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Blood vessels are the only system to provide nutrients and oxygen to
   every part of the body. Many diseases can have significant effects on
   blood vessel formation, so that the vascular network can be a cue to
   assess malicious tumor and ischemic tissues. Various imaging techniques
   can visualize blood vessel structure, but their applications are often
   constrained by either expensive costs, contrast agents, ionizing
   radiations, or a combination of the above. Photoacoustic imaging
   combines the high-contrast and spectroscopic-based specificity of
   optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging,
   and image contrast depends on optical absorption. This enables the
   detection of light absorbing chromophores such as hemoglobin with a
   greater penetration depth compared to purely optical techniques. We
   present here a skeletonization algorithm for vessel architectural
   analysis using non-invasive photoacoustic 3D images acquired without the
   administration of any exogenous contrast agents. 3D photoacoustic images
   were acquired on rats (n = 4) in two different time points: before and
   after a burn surgery. A skeletonization technique based on the
   application of a vesselness filter and medial axis extraction is
   proposed to extract the vessel structure from the image data and six
   vascular parameters (number of vascular trees (NT), vascular density
   (VD), number of branches (NB), 2D distance metric (DM), inflection count
   metric (ICM), and sum of angles metric (SOAM)) were calculated from the
   skeleton. The parameters were compared (1) in locations with and without
   the burn wound on the same day and (2) in the same anatomic location
   before (control) and after the burn surgery. Four out of the six
   descriptors were statistically different (VD, NB, DM, ICM, p < 0.05)
   when comparing two anatomic locations on the same day and when
   considering the same anatomic location at two separate times (i.e.
   before and after burn surgery). The study demonstrates an approach to
   obtain quantitative characterization of the vascular network from 3D
   photoacoustic images without any exogenous contrast agent which can
   assess microenvironmental changes related to disease progression.}},

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{219}},

Abstract = {{We report the determination of a complete mechanism for the Br-/Br-2
   reaction in nitrobenzene using simulations of cyclic voltammograms at
   platinum and glassy carbon macroelectrodes and platinum
   ultramicroelectrodes at varying scan rates 90.02-500 V/s) and
   concentrations of Br-, Br-3(-), and Br-2 92.5-20 mM). As in other
   nonaqueous solvents and ionic liquids, we observe two consecutive redox
   processes at lower and higher potentials that we assign to the
   Br-/Br-3-and Br-3(-)/Br-2 redox reactions, respectively. A complete
   reaction mechanism, including the elementary steps of each process, was
   fit to the voltammetric data using DigiElch((R)) simulation software.
   The model proposed here is different from previous models of halide
   reactions in nonaqueous solvents in three ways. First, it proposes the
   direct oxidation and reduction of Br-3(-), whereas previous models
   describe the reduction and oxidation of X(3)(-)as a CE process, with the
   dissociation of X-3(-) into X-and X-2 occurring first. Second, it is
   able to accurately match data at a wide range of scan rates and
   concentrations without the use of unrealistically large homogeneous rate
   constants. Finally, it can match data at platinum and glassy carbon
   electrodes by simply changing the apparent heterogeneous kinetics of the
   electron transfer reactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bismuth oxyiodide has attracted strong interest as a nano-engineered
   material for high-performance electrodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC)
   cells. Herein, we demonstrate the visible-light-sensitive PEC
   photocathodes based on nano-engineered bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI). The
   photocathodes are comprised of plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) on
   hydrogen-reduced BiOI (H-BiOI) nanoflake arrays. The BiOI-based
   photocathodes exhibit an AM 1.5 photocurrent of 3.6 + 0.1 mA/cm(2) at 0
   V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. We attribute the enhanced
   photoreduction performance of our photocathodes to three factors that
   increase the formation and separation rates of electron-hole pairs for
   photocatalysis. Firstly, the small thickness of the nanoflakes
   facilitates the diffusion of minority carriers to the surfaces before
   their recombination. Secondly, the hydrogenation-induced oxygen
   vacancies in H-BiOI lead to increased acceptor density. Lastly,
   plasmonic effects in Au NPs enhance the light absorption, hot-carrier
   injection, and resonant energy transfer in the composite electrodes. Our
   experiments are coupled to optical simulations. This work demonstrates
   the tremendous potential of coupling plasmonic effects with
   nano-engineering to innovate visible-light-sensitive photocathodes for
   the realization of efficient PEC cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Stochastic ground-motion simulations for the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan,
   earthquake}},
Journal = {{EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{On April 15, 2016, Kumamoto, Japan, was struck by a large earthquake
   sequence, leading to severe casualty and building damage. The stochastic
   finite-fault method based on a dynamic corner frequency has been applied
   to perform ground-motion simulations for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake.
   There are 53 high-quality KiK-net stations available in the Kyushu
   region, and we employed records from all stations to determine
   region-specific source, path and site parameters. The calculated S-wave
   attenuation for the Kyushu region beneath the volcanic and non-volcanic
   areas can be expressed in the form of Q(s) = (85.5 +/- 1.5) f(0.68 +/-
   0.01) and Q(s) = (120 +/- 5) f (0.64 +/- 0.05), respectively. The
   effects of lateral S-wave velocity and attenuation heterogeneities on
   the ground-motion simulations were investigated. Site amplifications
   were estimated using the corrected cross-spectral ratios technique.
   Zero-distance kappa filter was obtained to be the value of 0.0514 +/-
   0.0055 s, using the spectral decay method. The stress drop of the
   mainshock based on the USGS slip model was estimated optimally to have a
   value of 64 bars. Our finite-fault model with optimized parameters was
   validated through the good agreement of observations and simulations at
   all stations. The attenuation characteristics of the simulated peak
   ground accelerations were also successfully captured by the
   ground-motion prediction equations. Finally, the ground motions at two
   destructively damaged regions, Kumamoto Castle and Minami Aso village,
   were simulated. We conclude that the stochastic finite-fault method with
   well-determined parameters can reproduce the ground-motion
   characteristics of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake in both the time and
   frequency domains. This work is necessary for seismic hazard assessment
   and mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{Protein aggregation and amyloid formation are implicated in many
   diseases as well as in other biological phenomena. Recent studies have
   suggested that amyloid formation of tumor suppressor p53 can lead to
   loss of its physiological function, resulting in accelerated cancer
   progression. Design of cancer therapeutics, therefore, requires
   understanding of the mechanism of pS3 aggregation. Here, we have
   employed atomistic simulations to characterize the aggregation process
   of the aggregation-prone (as suggested by experimental studies) p53
   fragment (LTIITLE, 252-258) and to assess the efficiency of its I254R
   mutant as an aggregation suppressor. We show that the wild-type sequence
   attains stable beta-sheet rich structure in the parallely arranged
   dimeric form, which dissociates in a sequential manner under mechanical
   force. The wild-type sequence further displays high aggregation
   propensity self-assembling into structures with parallel peptide
   arrangement. The I254R mutation destabilizes the dimer, changes the
   mechanical dissociation of the dimer to cooperative unfolding, reduces
   the aggregation propensity of the sequence, and alters the relative
   orientation of the peptides in the aggregate. Addition of the wild-type
   sequence, however, partially restores the aggregation propensity of the
   I254R mutant.}},

Abstract = {{Hard carbons attract myriad interest as anode materials for high-energy
   rechargeable batteries due to their low costs and high theoretical
   capacities; practically, they deliver unsatisfactory performance due to
   their intrinsically disordered microarchitecture. Here we report a
   facile ion catalyzed synthesis of a phenol formaldehyde resin-based
   hard-carbon aerogel that takes advantage of the chelation effect of
   phenol and Fe3+, which consists of a three-dimensionally interconnected
   carbon network embedded with hydrogen-rich, ordered microstructures of
   expanded nanographites and carbon micropores. The chelation effect
   ensures the homodispersion of Fe in the polymer segments of the
   precursor, so that an effective catalytic conversion from sp(3) to sp(2)
   carbon occurs, enabling free rearrangement of graphene sheets into
   expanded nanographite and carbon micropores. The structural merits of
   the carbon offer chances to achieve lithium/sodium storage performance
   far beyond that possible with the conventional carbon anode materials,
   including graphite and mesocarbon microbeads, along with fast kinetics
   and long cycle life. In this way, our hard carbon proves its feasibility
   to serve as an advanced anode material for high-energy rechargeable
   Li/Na batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a deadly infectious disease in which
   Abs play a critical role in naturally acquired immunity. However, the
   specificity and nature of Abs elicited in response to malaria are only
   partially understood. Autoreactivity and polyreactivity are common
   features of Ab responses in several infections and were suggested to
   contribute to effective pathogen-specific Ab responses. In this article,
   we report on the regulation of B cells expressing the inherently
   autoreactive VH4-34 H chain (identified by the 9G4 mAb) and 9G4(+)
   plasma IgG in adults and children living in a P. falciparum
   malaria-endemic area in West Africa. The frequency of 9G4(+) peripheral
   blood CD19(+) B cells was similar in United States adults and African
   adults and children; however, more 9G4(+) B cells appeared in classical
   and atypical memory B cell compartments in African children and adults
   compared with United States adults. The levels of 9G4(+) IgG increased
   following acute febrile malaria but did not increase with age as humoral
   immunity is acquired or correlate with protection from acute disease.
   This was the case, even though a portion of 9G4(+) B cells acquired
   phenotypes of atypical and classical memory B cells and 9G4(+) IgG
   contained equivalent numbers of somatic hypermutations compared with all
   other VHs, a characteristic of secondary Ab repertoire diversification
   in response to Ag stimulation. Determining the origin and function of
   9G4(+) B cells and 9G4(+) IgG in malaria may contribute to a better
   understanding of the varied roles of autoreactivity in infectious
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas important discoveries made by single-particle tracking have
   changed our view of the plasma membrane organization and motor protein
   dynamics in the past three decades, experimental studies of
   intracellular processes using single particle tracking are rather scarce

   study we use a newly developed 3D single-particle tracking method termed
   TSUNAMI (Tracking of Single particles Using Nonlinear And Multiplexed
   Illumination) to investigate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
   trafficking dynamics in live cells at 16/43 nm (xy/z) spatial
   resolution, with track duration ranging from 2 to 10 min and vertical
   tracking depth up to tens of microns. To analyze the long 3D
   trajectories generated by the TSUNAMI microscope, we developed a
   trajectory analysis algorithm, which reaches 81\% segment classification
   accuracy in control experiments (termed simulated movement experiments).
   When analyzing 95 EGF-stimulated EGFR trajectories acquired in live skin
   cancer cells, we find that these trajectories can be separated into
   three groups-immobilization (24.2\%), membrane diffusion only (51.6\%),
   and transport from membrane to cytoplasm (24.2\%). When EGFRs are
   membrane-bound, they show an interchange of Brownian diffusion and
   confined diffusion. When EGFRs are internalized, transitions from
   confined diffusion to directed diffusion and from directed diffusion
   back to confined diffusion are clearly seen. This observation agrees
   well with the model of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.}},

Title = {{Modification mechanism of asphalt binder with waste tire rubber and

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the fundamental modification mechanism of asphalt binder
   modified with waste tire rubber (WTR) and recycled polyethylene (RPE)
   was studied through a comprehensive laboratory program. The base asphalt
   binder was mixed with 5\% and 10\% WTR of the mass of the asphalt
   binder, respectively. The modified asphalt binder is then prepared with
   additional 2\% and 4\% RPE of the mass of the base asphalt binder,
   respectively. Morphological analysis methods, which included Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), fluorescence microscopy,
   thermogravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), were
   employed to understand the modification mechanism. Conventional tests,
   dynamic shear rheometer and bending beam rheometer were used to assess
   the Theological characteristics under different temperatures. From the
   testing results, it is found that the deformation resistance,
   high-temperature stability, and flexibility of asphalt binder are all
   improved after WTR and RPE were added. The modification mechanism of WTR
   and RPE on asphalt binder is the combination of physical process and
   chemical process. With proper modifying agent content, the interaction
   among WTR, RPE and light component guaranteed the homogeneity of asphalt
   binders, the WTR and RPE distributed uniformly in modified asphalt
   binder and the thermal stability was enhanced. The penetration decreased
   and softening point increased, which means that the deformation
   resistant was enhanced and the high temperature stability was improved.
   The complex shear modulus (G{*}) increased and the phase angle (delta)
   decreased after modification. When WTR dispersed in the bitumen, it
   formed a continuous elastic network. Furthermore, the increment of
   G{*}/sin delta proved that high-temperature deformation resistance was
   enhanced. The decrease in creep stiffness after modification with WTR
   and RPE suggested that the flexibility of asphalt binder was improved.
   The capacity to relax the load induced stresses was weakened at -6
   degrees C, -12 degrees C, and -18 degrees C but the ability increased at
   -24 degrees C. The performance was more stable after modification and
   the effect was better at lower temperatures. The high temperature
   performance grade changed and low temperature performance grade kept
   unchanged after modification, the PG 64-22 base asphalt binder changed
   into PG 76-22 for base asphalt binder with 5\% WTR and 2\% RPE and PG
   82-22 for base asphalt binder with 10\% WTR and 2\% RPE. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Carbon-coated Si-Cu3Si-Al2O3 nanocomposites have been synthesized via a
   facile mechanochemical reaction and employed as anode materials for
   lithium-ion batteries. Combined X-ray and microscopic studies show that
   the nanocomposites are composed of agglomerated nanostructured particles
   with uniform distribution of crystalline silicon, Cu3Si, and amorphous
   Al2O3. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the in situ
   incorporation of both the conductive Cu3Si and electrochemically stable
   Al2O3 phases results in a dramatic improvement of cyclability and rate
   capability, while the specific capacity decreases with increasing amount
   of Cu3Si. By controlling the Cu3Si content, the composite with a high
   tap density of similar to 1.2 g cm(-3) delivers a high reversible
   capacity of 841 mA h g(-1), excellent cyclability, and good rate
   performance up to 3.2 A g(-1) in half cells. Full-cell test coupled with
   a commercial spinel cathode also displays a high average operating
   voltage of >3.5 V, a relatively good capacity retention of similar to
   77.2\% after 50 cycles with a high initial efficiency of similar to
   86.3\%. The enhanced electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to
   the presence of the conductive Cu3Si buffer phase that mitigates
   structural degradation and offers high conductivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Mixing ventilation is the most common air distribution system, and often
   the same diffusers provide space cooling and heating. Proper diffuser
   selection affects characteristics of air distribution. Air distribution
   with all-air-heating is one of the major challenges for mixing
   ventilation as temperature stratification and corresponding low
   ventilation effectiveness may appear. The objective of this study is to
   provide supporting data for air distribution system designs for several
   of the most common types of ceiling diffusers in the cooling and heating
   regime. It defines operation range for selecting diffusers with: high
   ADPI and ventilation and temperature effectiveness. The study is based
   on experimental measurements in a full-scale test room. Air change
   effeteness was measured using CO2 tracer gas decay tests with various
   types of ceiling diffusers and internal loads. Also, the air flow was
   changed to produce different corresponding throw for the tested
   diffusers (T-0.25), which with characteristic space length for the
   diffuser jet flow (L) defined T-0.25/L, ratio. The results show that
   under heating conditions the air change effectiveness significantly
   decreases with decrease of T-0.25/L. Even for the recommended range of
   T-0.25/L, the value of air change effectiveness and temperature
   effectiveness are low: 0.56 to 0.87 and 0.58 to 0.75, respectively.
   Under cooling conditions, air change effectiveness and the temperature
   effectiveness were close to or higher than 1, regardless of diffuser
   type. The range of T-0.25/L value that can achieve good mixing under
   heating condition was significantly smaller than the one under cooling
   mode. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the influence of metalpara and ortho-position
   functional group structures on gas transport properties of two isomeric
   polyimides and their thermally rearranged (TR) polymers. The diamine
   isomers, 3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-biphenyl (p-HAB) and
   4,4'-dihydroxybiphenyl-3,3'-diamino-biphenyl (m-HAB), were polymerized
   with 2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxy-phenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride
   (6FDA) to form two aromatic polyimide isomers. These polyimides were
   also prepared with either hydroxyl or acetate groups at the
   ortho-positions to the imide ring, and the polyimides were partially
   converted to the corresponding polybenzoxazoles by thermal treatment at
   various temperatures and times. Single gas permeabilities of CH4, H-2,
   O-2, N-2 and CO2 were measured at 35 degrees C and upstream pressures
   ranging from 3 atm to 17 atm. Polyacetylimides and their corresponding
   TR polymers showed higher gas permeability and lower selectivity than
   polyhydroxyimides and their TR analogs, respectively. The effect of
   isomerism on gas transport properties was also investigated.
   Para-connected polyhydroxyimide had higher fractional free volume, and
   thus, gas permeability coefficients than meta connected
   polyhydroxyimide. Interestingly, in contrast to the metalpara effects
   previously reported in the literature for linear aromatic polymers, the
   meta-linked polyacetylimide had higher permeabilities and lower
   selectivities than its para-linked analog, presumably due to steric
   hindrance from the acetate groups that may inhibit the rotational
   mobility of the phenylene units in the para-linked isomer. For TR
   polymers derived from either polyhydroxyimides or polyacetylimides,
   para-configured polymers had higher gas permeabilities than
   meta-configured analogs. Finally, polyimide precursors for TR polymers
   can be sensitive to synthesis and casting conditions, and this study
   demonstrates how small variations in synthesis and casting procedure can
   have a significant effect on physical and gas permeation properties. (C)

Abstract = {{The gas transport properties of graphene oxides (GO) incorporated into

   To develop broad fundamental understanding of the connection between
   composite architecture and gas transport properties, both gas barrier
   and separation characteristics were evaluated. The permeability for
   several common gases was studied as a function of GO concentration.
   Incorporating only 3.55 vol\% (8 wt\%) GO into the PDMS matrix resulted
   in a more than 99.9\% reduction in gas permeation for various gases,
   such as H-2, O-2, N-2, CH4 and CO2. Moreover, factor of two enhancements
   in gas selectivities were observed for CO2/N-2 and CO2/CH4 compared to
   neat PDMS membranes. As a supplement to experimental data from
   scanning-electron and atomic-force microscopy and x-ray diffraction,
   theoretical models such as the Nielsen and Cussler models were applied

Abstract = {{The growth of Co-substituted BaTiO3 (BTO) films on Ge(001) substrates by
   molecular beam epitaxy is demonstrated. Energy-dispersive x-ray
   spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy images confirm the
   uniform Co distribution. However, no evidence of magnetic ordering is
   observed in samples grown for Co concentrations between 2\% and 40\%.
   Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements show that a 5\%
   Co-substituted BTO sample exhibits ferroelectric behavior.
   First-principles calculations indicate that while Co atoms couple
   ferromagnetically in the absence of oxygen vacancies, the occurrence of
   oxygen vacancies leads to locally antiferromagnetically coupled
   complexes with relatively strong spin coupling. The presence of a
   significant amount of oxygen vacancies is suggested by x-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Modern society requires sustainable energy-storage systems to complement
   the fast-growing implementation of renewable sources. However,
   conventional batteries are based on the redox reactions of metals, which
   are constrained by material abundance, cost, and environmental concerns.
   As an alternative, quinone-based organic redox species represent one of
   the most promising electrode materials as a result of features including
   material sustainability, tailorable properties, and environmental
   benignity. Here, we report a systematic study on the electrochemical
   characteristics of quinones for organic flow batteries with a combined
   experimental and computational method. The redox properties of quinones
   were found to be strongly dependent on the molecular aromaticity and
   their electronic structures. In the prototype cell test, a
   naphthoquinone-based battery delivered a volumetric capacity of 20 Ah
   L-1 and reached an energy density of 60 Wh L-1. Because quinones play a
   key role in bio-electrochemical processes, a fundamental understanding
   of their reaction mechanisms in electrochemical energy-storage devices
   can pave the path toward bio-inspired sustainable energy technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Block copolymer (BCP) lithography is capable of forming features on the
   order of tens of nanometers, and this size is desirable for numerous
   applications, including data storage devices, microprocessors, and
   membranes. BCPs must be oriented to form device-relevant structures, and
   poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate) (PS-PMMA) is the most widely
   studied BCP due to its ability to form perpendicularly oriented features
   when simply heated on an energetically nonpreferential substrate.
   However, the smallest practical feature sizes attainable by PS-PMM.A.
   are about 11 nm. In this work, we incorporate a self-interacting
   monomer, vinylnaphthalene, into the styrenic block of PS-PMMA to
   effectively increase its Flory-Huggins interaction parameter.
   Introducing 35 mol \% of vinylnaphthalene into the BCP more than doubled
   its chi parameter, resulting in a BCP structure that is capable of
   forming features as small as 6.3 nm. We also demonstrate that like
   PS-PMMA, this new poly((styrene-random-vinylnaphthalene)-block-methyl
   methacrylate) (PSVN-PMMA) BCP can be oriented vertically with only
   thermal annealing.}},

   effect}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{The vibrational Stark shift is an important effect in determining the
   electrostatic environment for molecular or condensed matter systems.
   However, accurate ab initio calculations of the vibrational Stark effect
   are a technically demanding challenge. We make use of density functional
   theory constructed on a real-space grid to expedite the computation of
   this effect. Our format is especially advantageous for the investigation
   of small molecules in finite fields as cluster boundary conditions
   eliminate spurious supercell interactions and allow for charged systems,
   while convergence is controlled by a single parameter, the grid spacing.
   The Stark tuning rate is highly sensitive to the interaction between
   anharmonicity in a vibrational mode and the applied field. To ensure
   this subtle interaction is fully captured, we apply three parallel
   approaches: a direct finite field, a perturbative method, and a
   molecular dynamics method. We illustrate this method by applying it to
   several small molecules containing C-O and C-N bonds and show that a
   consistent result can be obtained. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Isoforms of the Fc gamma receptor III (Fc gamma RIII or CD16) are cell
   surface receptors for the Fc portion of IgG and important regulators of
   humoral immune responses. Different ligand binding kinetics of Fc gamma
   RIII isoforms are obtained in three dimensions by surface plasmon
   resonance and in two dimensions by a micropipette adhesion frequency
   assay. We show that the anchor structure of CD16 isoforms isolated from
   the cell membrane affects their binding affinities in a ligand-specific
   manner. Changing the receptor anchor structure from full to partial to
   none decreases the ligand binding affinity for human IgG1 (hIgG1) but
   increases it for murine IgG2a (mIgG2a). Removing N-glycosylation from
   the CD16 protein core by tunicamycin also increases the ligand binding
   affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that deglycosylation
   at Asn-163 of CD16 removes the steric hindrance for the CD16-hIgG1 Fc
   binding and thus increases the binding affinity. These results highlight
   an unexpected sensitivity of ligand binding to the receptor anchor
   structure and glycosylation and suggest their respective roles in
   controlling allosterically the conformation of the ligand binding pocket
   of CD16.}},

Title = {{A Comprehensive Model for Real Gas Transport in Shale Formations with
   Complex Non-planar Fracture Networks}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{A complex fracture network is generally generated during the hydraulic
   fracturing treatment in shale gas reservoirs. Numerous efforts have been
   made to model the flow behavior of such fracture networks. However, it
   is still challenging to predict the impacts of various gas transport
   mechanisms on well performance with arbitrary fracture geometry in a
   computationally efficient manner. We develop a robust and comprehensive
   model for real gas transport in shales with complex non-planar fracture
   network. Contributions of gas transport mechanisms and fracture
   complexity to well productivity and rate transient behavior are
   systematically analyzed. The major findings are: simple planar fracture
   can overestimate gas production than non-planar fracture due to less
   fracture interference. A ``hump{''} that occurs in the transition period
   and formation linear flow with a slope less than 1/2 can infer the
   appearance of natural fractures. The sharpness of the ``hump{''} can
   indicate the complexity and irregularity of the fracture networks. Gas
   flow mechanisms can extend the transition flow period. The gas
   desorption could make the ``hump{''} more profound. The Knudsen
   diffusion and slippage effect play a dominant role in the later
   production time. Maximizing the fracture complexity through generating
   large connected networks is an effective way to increase shale gas
   production.}},

   quasi-equilibrium conditions However, a kinetic-based understanding of
   the capacitance may be important, especially since the dynamics of ion
   transport can exhibit dramatic differences under confinement compared to
   the bulk liquid phase; ion transport is driven by the competition
   between the electrostatic electrode-ion and ion-ion interactions, which
   can be comparable as the internal surface area to volume ratio
   increases. In this work, we study the relationship between the dynamics
   of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM/BF4) ionic liquid
   and the capacitance within two idealized cylindrical subnanometer pores
   with diameters of 0.81 and 1.22 nm using classical molecular dynamics
   simulations. By adjusting the voltage scan rate, we find that the
   capacitance is highly sensitive to the formation of an electroneutral
   ionic liquid region; with rapid charging, consolidated anion-cation
   contact pairs, which remain trapped within the pore, restrict the local
   accumulation of charge carriers and, thereby, the capacitance. These
   findings highlight potential kinetic limitations that can mitigate the
   benefits from electrodes with subnanometer pores.}},

Abstract = {{To further advance a subcutaneous injection of monoclonal antibodies
   (mAbs) at elevated concentrations, novel concepts are needed to lower
   the viscosity. The addition of high concentrations of cosolutes, namely,
   arginine glutamate (ArgGlu) or ArgHCl, reduced the viscosity of a
   similar to 250 mg/mL mAb solution up to 6-fold. With ArgGlu, the
   viscosity of the mAb solution was reduced to 30 cP and for a polyclonal
   sheep IgG solution to 17 cP both at similar to 250 mg/mL. Viscosities
   went through a maximum at the mAb isoelectric point for solutions with
   ArgGlu or ArgHCl. In contrast the viscosity was only weakly affected by
   NaCl or the preferentially excluded molecule trehalose. The large
   viscosity reduction from Arg may be attributed to direct binding to the
   mAb, resulting in suppression of both hydrophobic and local anisotropic
   electrostatic attraction. Aggregate formation was negligible for high
   cosolute mAb solutions as demonstrated by SEC even after 8 weeks of 25
   degrees C storage.}},

Abstract = {{Low electrical resistivity measurements in organic-rich mudrocks are
   commonplace in highly mature zones. These low resistivity values are
   usually difficult to justify and lead to overestimation of water
   saturation when using conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation
   models (e.g., dual water and Wax-man-Smits). Previous publications
   suggest that the electrical conductivity of kerogen increases when it
   thermally matures. This increase in thermal maturity of kerogen might
   contribute to low resistivity measurements in organic-rich mudrocks.
   However, electrical properties of kerogen within these rocks have not
   yet been quantified experimentally. We have introduced a technique to
   quantify electrical resistivity of kerogen through combined experimental
   and numerical approaches and quantified electrical resistivity of
   kerogen samples from the Haynesville and Eagle Ford Formations. We first
   isolated kerogen from mudrock samples using physical and chemical
   treatments. The isolated kerogen powder was then compressed into a
   homogeneous disk. Then, we synthetically matured mudrock and kerogen
   samples to controlled maturity levels and measured the electrical
   resistivity and geochemical properties of each sample. The true
   electrical resistivity of kerogen was then estimated by minimizing the
   difference between the numerically simulated and measured electrical
   resistivity of the molded kerogen samples. We have observed a
   significant decrease in the electrical resistivity of kerogen isolated
   from the Haynesville (i.e., up to four orders of magnitude) and Eagle
   Ford (i.e., up to nine orders of magnitude) Formations upon heat
   treatment from 300 degrees C to 800 degrees C. The decrease in
   resistivity can be reasoned by the chemical transformations of organic
   matter through thermal maturation. The results of solid-state C-13
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron
   microscopy imaging confirmed increase in graphitization and aromaticity
   in the kerogen samples as thermal maturity increases. Our outcomes can
   potentially improve interpretation of electrical resistivity logs in
   organic-rich mudrocks, such as enhancing well-log-based assessment of in
   situ hydrocarbon saturation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the adsorption of 5-nm silica nanoparticles onto

   functionalization was evaluated for four different surfaces: unmodified,
   surface-modified with anionic (sulfonate), cationic (quaternary ammonium
   (quat)), and nonionic (polyethylene glycol (PEG)) surfactant. We
   employed ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to determine the concentration
   of adsorbed nanoparticles in conditions that are likely to be found in
   subsurface reservoir environments. PEG-coated and quat/ PEG-coated
   silica nanoparticles were found to significantly adsorb onto the clay
   surfaces, and the effects of electrolyte type (NaCl, KCl) and
   concentration, nanoparticle concentration, pH, temperature, and clay
   type on PEG-coated nanoparticle adsorption were studied. The type and
   concentration of electrolytes were found to influence the degree of
   adsorption, suggesting a relationship between the interlayer spacing of
   the clay and the adsorption ability of the nanoparticles. Under the
   experimental conditions reported in this paper, the isotherms for
   nanoparticle adsorption onto montmorillonite at 25 degrees C indicate
   that adsorption occurs less readily as the nanoparticle concentration

Abstract = {{All-optical ultrafast signal modulation and routing by low-loss
   nanodevices is a crucial step towards an ultracompact optical chip with
   high performance. Here, we propose a specifically designed silicon dimer
   nanoantenna, which is tunable via photoexcitation of dense electron-hole
   plasma with ultrafast relaxation rate. On the basis of this concept, we
   demonstrate the effect of beam steering by up to 20 degrees through
   simple variation of the intensity of incident light. The effect, which
   is suitable for ultrafast light routing in an optical chip, is
   demonstrated both in the visible and near-IR spectral regions for
   silicon-and germanium-based nanoantennas. We also reveal the effect of
   electron-hole plasma photoexcitation on the local density of states
   (LDOS) in the dimer gap and find that the orientation averaged LDOS can
   be altered by 50\%, whereas modification of the projected LDOS can be
   even more dramatic, almost five-fold for transverse dipole orientation.
   Moreover, our analytical model sheds light on the transient dynamics of
   the studied nonlinear nanoantennas, yielding all temporal
   characteristics of the suggested ultrafast nanodevice. The proposed
   concept paves the way to the creation of low-loss, ultrafast, and
   compact devices for optical signal modulation and routing.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of unconventional shale and tight reservoirs,
   stimulation treatments that place multiple transverse fractures have
   received greater attention in recent years. The postfracture
   productivity of such low-permeability reservoirs is largely determined
   by the matrix/fracture contact area with appropriate fracture
   conductivity. Although it is often anticipated that the fractures are
   infinitely conductive, the general belief is that production increases
   with the proppant amount injected.
   This paper presents an approach to assess the proppant amount injected
   by determining the optimum post-fracture conductivity. First, through
   use of 3D finite-difference reservoir simulations in a naturally
   fractured reservoir, which has both the hydraulic fracture and natural
   fractures modeled explicitly as discrete gridblocks, we find cumulative
   production as a function of fracture conductivity. For a fixed propped
   length and production time, we observe a critical conductivity beyond
   which the production is insensitive to the conductivity. The critical
   conductivity is then obtained as a function of the propped length and
   production time. The numerical results show that the critical
   conductivity increases with propped length and decreases with production
   time. The effect of stimulated natural-fracture properties (spacing and
   permeability) on the critical conductivity is then investigated. For
   reservoirs with matrix permeability in the range of 20 to 1,000 nd,
   natural fractures increase the short-term critical conductivity, but
   decrease the medium-to long-term conductivity. The paper also evaluates
   the influence of water production, cluster spacing, and flowing
   bottomhole pressure (BHP) on the critical conductivity.
   This study demonstrates that fracture designs that are based on
   pseudosteady-state solutions are not appropriate for naturally fractured
   shale reservoirs and can lead to significantly lower initial production.
   Considering conductivity degradation over time, fracture designs that
   target achieving 1-year critical conductivity are recommended. A simple,
   yet robust workflow that is based on knowledge of 1-year critical
   conductivity is also presented for systematically selecting the type and
   amount of proppant for stimulation treatment. Such a workflow can
   mitigate trial-and-errorbased and data-driven approaches in the
   industry. An example is demonstrated for the Marcellus play.}},

Abstract = {{Complex fracture networks have become more evident in shale reservoirs
   as a result of the interaction between pre-existing natural fractures
   (NFs) and hydraulic fractures (HFs). Accurate characterization of
   fracture complexity plays an important role in optimizing fracturing
   design, especially for shale reservoirs with high-density NFs.
   In this study, we simulated simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation
   within a single fracturing stage by use of a complex HF-development
   model. The model was developed to simulate complex fracture propagation
   by coupling rock mechanics and fluid mechanics. A simplified 3D
   displacement-discontinuity method (DDM) was implemented to more
   accurately calculate fracture displacements and fracture-induced
   dynamic-stress changes than our previously developed pseudo-3D model.
   The effects of perforation-cluster spacing, differential stress (S-Hmax
   - S-hmin), and the geometry of various NF patterns on injection pressure
   and fracture complexity were investigated.
   The single-stage simulation results show that (1) higher differential
   stress suppresses fracture length and increases injection pressure; (2)
   there is an optimal choice for the number of fractures per stage to
   maximize effective fracture-surface contact area, beyond which
   increasing the number of fractures actually decreases effective fracture
   area; and (3) fracture complexity is a function of NF patterns (various
   regular-pattern geometries were investigated). NFs with small relative
   angle to HFs are more likely to control the fracture-propagation path.
   Also, NF patterns with more long fractures tend to increase the
   likelihood to dominate the preferential fracture trend of fracture
   trajectory. Our numerical model can provide a physics-based complex
   fracture network that can be imported into reservoir-simulation models
   for production analysis. The overall sensitivity results presented
   should serve as guidelines for fracture-complexity analysis.}},

   this, we develop a two-dimensional optimal channel network (OCN) model
   with a controllable rainfall distribution to simulate the evolution of
   river networks, governed by the principle of minimum energy expenditure,
   inside a prescribed boundary. We show that under nonuniform
   precipitation conditions, river networks reorganize significantly toward
   new patterns with different geomorphic and hydrologic signatures. This
   reorganization is mainly observed in the form of migration of channels
   of different orders, widening or elongation of basins as well as
   formation and extinction of channels and basins. In particular, when the
   precipitation gradient is locally increased, the higher-order channels,
   including the mainstream river, migrate toward regions with higher
   precipitation intensity. Through pertinent examples, the reorganization
   of the drainage network is quantified via stream parameters such as
   Horton-Strahler and Tokunaga measures, order-based channel total length
   and river long profiles obtained via simulation of three-dimensional
   basin topography, while the hydrologic response of the evolved network
   is investigated using metrics such as hydrograph and power spectral
   density of simulated streamflows at the outlet of the network. In
   addition, using OCNs, we investigate the effect of orographic
   precipitation patterns on multicatchment landscapes composed of several
   interacting basins. Our results show that network-inspired methods can
   be utilized as insightful and versatile models for directly exploring
   the effects of climate change on the evolution of river drainage
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To develop a fully-automated algorithm to process axial
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices for quantifying abdominal
   visceral, subcutaneous and total adipose tissues, i.e., VAT, SAT, and
   TAT, without human intervention or prior knowledge.
   Materials and Methods: Fat regions in single MRI slice or sequence (20
   slices) were identified with image processing techniques including
   region-growing, inhomogeneity correction, fuzzy c-means clustering, and
   active contours segmentation. The MR images of 85 subjects (60 males and
   25 females), whose body mass index (BMI) values ranged from 19.96 to
   40.35 kg/m(2), were analyzed using the fully-automated algorithm-the
   automatic method developed in the research and the widely used
   semi-automated software (sliceOmatic (R) Tomovision, Inc.)-the reference
   method.
   Results: The proposed automated method showed good performance against
   the reference method to quantify adipose tissues in both single
   umbilical slice and MRI sequence. The square of the Pearson correlation
   coefficients (R-2) based on the results generated from the two methods
   for VAT/SAT/TAT were 0.977/0.998/0.997 for single slice data and
   0.995/0.999/0.999 for volumetric data. The intra-class correlation of
   visceral adipose tissue (VAT) between the three operators was 0.939 in
   the reference method, which was improved to 0.999 in the automatic
   method. The adipose tissue measurements in the slice at Lumbar 3
   vertebra have the highest correlation with the total fat volumes across
   the entire abdomen.
   Conclusion: The fully-automated algorithm presented in the paper
   provides an accurate and reliable assessment of abdominal fat without
   human intervention. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an iterative framework for solving the
   stochastic transmission capacity expansion planning (TCEP) optimization
   problem with N - 1 contingency analysis. A three-level filtering
   algorithm is designed that uses developed important scenario
   identification index (ISII) and similar scenario elimination (SSE)
   technique to decrease the number of reliability constraints in
   stochastic TCEP in a systematic and trackable way. This filter decreases
   structural constraints in our TCEP mixed-integer programming formulation
   in each iteration (up to 99.8\% in the first iteration), and the
   iterative framework adds reliability constraints into the optimization
   problem gradually in order to decrease the total simulation time. A
   lower bound is calculated to quantify the quality of results. To verify
   capabilities of the proposed method, it is applied to a reduced ERCOT
   system with 317 buses, 427 binary variables, and ten scenarios. The
   numerical result shows that the proposed method can solve large-scale
   stochastic TCEP optimization problems faster, and its relative
   performance improves with increasing number of scenarios and the system

   Manufacturing Models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{As additive manufacturing (AM) matures, models are beginning to take a
   more prominent stage in design and process planning. A limitation
   frequently encountered in AM models is a lack of indication about their
   precision and accuracy. Often overlooked, model uncertainty is required
   for validation of AM models, qualification of AM-produced parts, and
   uncertainty management. This paper presents a discussion on the origin
   and propagation of uncertainty in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF)
   models. Four sources of uncertainty are identified: modeling
   assumptions, unknown simulation parameters, numerical approximations,
   and measurement error in calibration data. Techniques to quantify
   uncertainty in each source are presented briefly, along with estimation
   algorithms to diminish prediction uncertainty with the incorporation of
   online measurements. The methods are illustrated with a case study based
   on a thermal model designed for melt pool width predictions. Model
   uncertainty is quantified for single track experiments, and the effect
   of online estimation in overhanging structures is studied via
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{During CO2 injection into geological formations, petrophysical and
   geomechanical properties of host formations can be altered due to
   mineral dissolution and precipitation. Field and laboratory results have
   shown that sandstone and siltstone can be altered by CO2-water mixtures,
   but few quantitative studies have been performed to fully investigate
   underlying mechanisms. Based on the hypothesis that CO2-water mixtures
   alter the integrity of rock structure by attacking cements rather than
   grains, we attempt to explain the degradation of cementation due to
   long-term contact with CO2 and water and mechanisms for changes in rock
   mechanical properties. Many sandstones, including calcite-cemented
   quartzitic sandstone, chlorite-cemented quartzitic sandstone, and
   hematite-cemented quartzitic sandstone, contain interparticle cements
   that are more readily affected by CO2-water mixtures than grains. A
   model that couples the discrete element method and the bonded-particle
   model is used to perform simulations of indentation tests on synthetic
   rocks with crystal and random packings. The model is verified against
   the analytical cavity expansion model and validated against laboratory
   indentation tests on Entrada sandstone with and without CO2 alteration.
   Sensitivity analysis is performed for cementation microscopic parameters
   including stiffness, size, axial, and shear strength. The simulation
   results indicate that the CO2-related degradation of mechanical
   properties in bleached Entrada sandstone can be attributed to the
   reduction of cement size rather than cement strength. Our study
   indicates that it is possible to describe the CO2-related rock
   alteration through particle-scale mechanisms.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Uranium (U) has been released to surface soil and groundwater through
   military and industrial activities. Soluble forms of U transferred to
   drinking water sources and food supplements can potentially threaten
   humans and the biosphere due to its chemical toxicity and radioactivity.
   The immobilization of aqueous U onto iron-based minerals is one of the
   most vital geochemical processes controlling the transport of U. As a
   consequence, much research has been focused on the use of iron-based
   materials for the treatment of U contaminated waters. One material
   currently being tested is nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI). However,
   understanding the removal mechanism of U onto nZVI is crucial to develop
   new technologies for contaminated water resources. This review article
   aims to provide information on the removal mechanism of U onto nZVI
   under different conditions (pH, U concentration, solution ion strength,
   humic acid, presence of O-2 and CO2, microorganism effect) pertinent to
   environmental and engineered systems, and to provide risk or performance
   assessment results with the stability of nZVI products after removal of
   U in environmental restoration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Plastic photovoltaic devices (PVs) were fabricated by spray-depositing
   copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2) nanocrystals into micrometer-scale
   groove features patterned into polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   substrates. Each groove has sidewall coatings of Al/CdS and Au and
   performs as an individual solar cell. These PV groove features can be
   linked electrically in series to achieve high voltages. For example,
   cascades of up to 15 grooves have been made with open-circuit voltages
   of up to 5.8 V. On the basis of the groove geometry, the power
   conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices reached as high as 2.2\%.
   Using the active area and photovoltaic response of devices determined
   from light-beam induced current (LBIC) and photoreflectivity
   measurements gave PCE values as high as 4.4\%.}},

Title = {{FEM-BASED DISCRETIZATION-INVARIANT MCMC METHODS FOR PDE-CONSTRAINED
   BAYESIAN INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS AND IMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{We present a systematic construction of FEM-based dimension independent
   (discretization-invariant) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches to
   explore PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems in infinite
   dimensional parameter spaces. In particular, we consider two frameworks
   to achieve this goal: Metropolize-then-discretize and
   discretize-then-Metropolize. The former refers to the method of
   discretizing function-space MCMC methods. The latter, on the other hand,
   first discretizes the Bayesian inverse problem and then proposes MCMC
   methods for the resulting discretized posterior probability density. In
   general, these two frameworks do not commute, that is, the resulting
   finite dimensional MCMC algorithms are not identical. The discretization
   step of the former may not be trivial since it involves both numerical
   analysis and probability theory, while the latter, perhaps ``easier{''},
   may not be discretization-invariant using traditional approaches. This
   paper constructively develops finite element (FEM) discretization
   schemes for both frameworks and shows that both commutativity and
   discretization-invariance are attained. In particular, it shows how to
   construct discretizethen-Metropolize approaches for both
   Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and the hybrid Monte Carlo method
   that commute with their Metropolize-then-discretize counterparts. The
   key that enables this achievement is a proper FEM discretization of the
   prior, the likelihood, and the Bayes' formula, together with a correct
   definition of quantities such as the gradient and the covariance matrix
   in discretized finite dimensional parameter spaces. The implication is
   that practitioners can take advantage of the developments in this paper
   to straightforwardly construct discretization-invariant
   discretize-then-Metropolize MCMC for large-scale inverse problems.
   Numerical results for one-and two-dimensional elliptic inverse problems
   with up to 17899 parameters are presented to support the proposed
   developments.}},

Title = {{Difference in thermodynamics between two types of esophageal temperature

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Luminal esophageal temperature monitoring is performed with a
   variety of temperature probes, but little is known about the
   relationship between the structure of a given probe and its
   thermodynamic characteristics.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference in
   thermodynamics between a 9Fr standard esophageal probe and an 18Fr
   esophageal stethoscope.
   METHODS In the experimental setting, each probe was submerged in a
   constant temperature water bath maintained at 42 degrees C; in the
   patient setting, we monitored the temperature with both probes at the
   same time.
   RESULTS The time constant of the stethoscope was higher than that of the
   probe (33.5 vs 8.3 s). Compared to the probe, the mean temperature
   measured by the stethoscope at 10 seconds was significantly lower (22.5
   degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C vs 33.5 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C, P <
   .0001), whereas the time to reach the peak temperature was significantly
   longer (132.6 +/- 5.9 s vs 38.8 +/- 1.0 s, P < .0001). Even in the
   ablation cases we observed that when the esophageal probe reached a peak
   temperature of 39.6 degrees C +/- 0.3 C, the esophageal stethoscope
   still displayed a temperature of 37.3 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C (a
   mean of 2.39 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C lower, P < .0001), showing a
   <0.5 degrees C increase in temperature half of the times.
   CONCLUSION The 18Fr esophageal stethoscope has a significantly slower
   time response compared to the 9Fr esophageal probe. In the clinical
   setting, this might result in a considerable underestimation of the
   Luminal esophageal temperature with potentially fatal consequences.}},

   Interleaving the latter with strategic queries to sensors, the temporal

Abstract = {{The curvature effect of the 3-D layout may result in a severe
   deterioration of the breakdown voltage in a power lateral
   double-diffused MOS (LDMOS). In this paper, a novel 3-D analytical model
   is proposed to provide the physical insight of curvature effect in small
   radius region by solving the 3-D Poisson in cylindrical coordinates. The
   proposed model indicates that the curvature effect equivalently changes
   the drift region doping concentration, thus altering the surface
   electric field profile. The proposed 3-D model can accurately describe
   the surface field profile in the fingertip regions of the multifinger
   layout, and provides an effective way to reveal the influence of
   curvature effect on the performance of silicon-on-insulator LDMOS.
   Furthermore, based on the proposed model, a corresponding structure
   optimization criterion is derived to provide a simple but effective
   method for the device structure parameters optimization.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{One significant advantage of imprint lithography (IL) over
   photolithography is that the field size is not limited optically, and
   so, throughput can be very high (>100 cm(2)/s). But, in applications
   requiring precise (sub-5nm) overlay, the field size is limited by the
   distortion (between template and wafer) to about the same field size (26
   x 33mm) as employed in current photolithographic tools for semiconductor
   integrated circuits. This reduces the throughput of current IL tools to
   less than that of current photolithographic tools. Here, the authors
   have, for the first time, created a multifield (dual and quad fields)
   nanoscale overlay capability by optimally combining (1) Precision
   mechanical actuators around the periphery of the fields which can
   correct for magnification and shear over the whole field, and (2) high
   resolution intrafield isotropic expansion and contraction using an array
   of local temperature control units. The authors have developed control
   algorithms for sub-5 nm overlay precision over up to four fields using
   thermomechanical simulations, and the authors have experimentally
   validated the approach. This research has the potential to significantly
   improve IL throughput without compromising nanoscale overlay. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Silicon (Si)-containing block copolymers (BCPs) are promising candidates
   for directed self-assembly patterning applications and are able to
   access structures with critical dimensions less than 10 nm. Significant
   etch contrast between the blocks is required to integrate BCPs for
   patterning applications and form an initial topographical mask. For
   Si-containing BCPs, O-2 plasma exposure can give high etch contrast
   between the blocks by forming a thin etch resistant silicon oxide (SiOx)
   surface layer from the Si-containing block. The authors have also found
   that H-2 and N-2/H-2 plasmas can form etch resistant barrier layers from
   organosilicon polymers (OSPs). Photodegradation of the OSPs induced by
   H-2 plasma-generated vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons initiates the
   formation of this etch barrier layer. Fourier transform infrared
   transmission spectroscopy measurements show enhanced VUV-induced
   degradation in polymers with higher Si content due to cleavage of the
   methylsilyl bonds (Si-CH3) and subsequent carbon depletion, leading to
   formation of an etch resistant Si-enriched surface layer. Furthermore, a
   dynamic photolysis model based on the dissociation of Si-Si and Si-CH3
   bonds shows that higher Si content in the polymer implies deeper photon
   penetration. The authors conclude that higher VUV fluxes and higher Si
   content promote the formation of etch resistant surface barriers on the
   Si-containing block when dry developing Si-containing BCPs with H-2-rich
   plasmas. Finally, plasma dry development of an aligned, Si-containing
   BCP with sub-10 nm domains is demonstrated using a N-2/H-2 plasma. (C)

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Angular scatterometry is used to characterize the nanostructure
   parameters of two samples: a high dielectric contrast similar to 100-nm
   period Al wire-grid polarizer (WGP), and a low dielectric contrast
   similar to 130-nm period photoresist grating on a flexible polycarbonate
   substrate; both fabricated by nanoimprint lithography. The zero-order
   diffraction (reflection) is monitored for a large incident angle range
   from 8 degrees to 80 degrees. For the WGP, four wavelengths (244-, 405-,
   633-, and 982-nm) are used to study the dependence of the scatterometry
   parametric determination as a function of the sample pitch to wavelength
   ratio (p/lambda: 0.41-0.1). A 4-nm thick native Al2O3 layer was added to
   the scatterometry simulation and dramatically improved the
   cross-correlations between results at the different wavelengths. For the
   photoresist samples, the scatterometry results at 405 nm are compared
   with atomic force microscopy measurements and the master grating
   structure. The scatterometry results are sensitive to inhomogeneity of
   the sample and show a capability for classifying different types of
   macroscopic defects. (C) 2016 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{C-phycocyanin, a natural blue-colored pigment-protein complex was
   explored as a novel photosensitizer for use in low-level laser therapy

   extended time of treatment. It did not exhibit any visible toxic effect
   in the absence of light. Under 625-nm laser irradiation, c-phycocyanin
   generated cytotoxic stress through ROS induction, which killed
   MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells depending on concentrations. Different
   fluorescent staining of laser-treated cells explored apoptotic cell
   death characteristics like the shrinking of cells, cytoplasmic
   condensation, nuclei cleavage, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. In

   for Enhanced Volumetric Ultrasound Imaging}},
Journal = {{Applied Sciences-Basel}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Volumetric ultrasound imaging has been primarily used as a clinical tool
   to diagnose cardiac dysfunction. However, the modality still suffers
   from system complexity due to a large number of receive channels for
   volumetric reconstruction. The aim of the study was to numerically
   assess a cross-shaped sparse array with a dynamic transmit focusing
   method to reduce the system complexity and to compensate for the image
   quality of unfocused volumetric imaging. Analytical simulations with
   two-way point spread functions demonstrated that the cross-shaped sparse
   array entailed up to an 84\% increase in side-lobes (up to 32 dB), thus
   leading to significant degradation of the point spread function in the
   diagonal plane. A dynamic transmit focusing method was able to vividly
   overcome the image degradation by transmitting more beams with tilting
   angles. This also yielded a comparable image sensitivity (65 dB) to that
   of the full array when 31 x 31 tilted waves were used. The proposed
   cross-shaped sparse array with the dynamic transit focusing method can
   be used to enhance the frame rate as well as the image quality for
   unfocused ultrasound imaging.}},

Abstract = {{By virtue of large antenna arrays, massive MIMO systems have a potential
   to yield higher spectral and energy efficiency in comparison with the
   conventional MIMO systems. This paper addresses uplink channel
   estimation in massive MIMO-OFDM systems with frequency selective
   channels. We propose an efficient distributed minimum mean square error
   (MMSE) algorithm that can achieve near optimal channel estimates at low
   complexity by exploiting the strong spatial correlation among antenna
   array elements. The proposed method involves solving a reduced
   dimensional MMSE problem at each antenna followed by a repetitive
   sharing of information through collaboration among neighboring array
   elements. To further enhance the channel estimates and/or reduce the
   number of reserved pilot tones, we propose a data-aided estimation
   technique that relies on finding a set of most reliable data carriers.
   Furthermore, we use stochastic geometry to quantify the pilot
   contamination, and in turn use this information to analyze the effect of
   pilot contamination on channel MSE. The simulation results validate our
   analysis and show near optimal performance of the proposed estimation
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a practical downlink transmission approach for
   single-cell full-dimension multiple-input-multiple-output (FD-MIMO)
   systems with large-scale uniform planar antenna array at the base
   station ( BS). Under the assumption of only statistical channel state
   information ( CSI) at the BS, we derive the optimal beamforming vector
   of each user by maximizing a lower bound on the average
   signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio. Some main guidelines for user
   scheduling are also derived under this criterion. Based on these
   results, a low-complexity 3-D beamforming space-division multiple-access
   ( SDMA) transmission algorithm exploiting only the statistical CSI of
   each user is proposed. Furthermore, the ergodic sum rate of the proposed
   algorithm is analyzed, and a closed-form expression, as well as a low
   signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR) approximation and a high-SNR approximation,
   are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
   performs well in terms of achievable sum rate, and the analytical
   results on its achievable sum rate are validated.}},

Abstract = {{We integrate microseismic data and pressure measurements at far-field
   observation wells to characterize the relationship between deformation
   and fluid flow during hydraulic fracturing and production in four
   horizontal wells in an unconventional shale play. The microseismicity
   qualitatively delineated, where injection fluid traveled during
   stimulation. However, there was one clear example of the Kaiser effect,
   in which a strong pressure signal propagated aseismically over hundreds
   of feet through fractures that had recently been stimulated around a
   neighboring well. Analysis suggested that poroelastic pressure changes
   caused by fracture deformation were minimal because of the high
   compressibility of the volatile oil formation fluid. Therefore, the
   pressure changes at the observations wells were likely caused by flow of
   the injection fluid. Based on this hypothesis, the pressure signals in
   the observation wells were roughly categorized based on whether the
   pressure response exceeded the magnitude of the minimum principal
   stress. The relationship between pressure and the minimum principal
   stress can be used to identify whether fluid traveled through newly
   forming hydraulic fractures or through stimulated natural fractures.
   However, the interpretation was significantly complicated by uncertainty
   in the magnitude of the stress caused by the prior depletion of the
   observation wells. In some observation wells, the pressure entered a
   gradual decline over time, indicating that significant long-term fluid
   production occurred in the neighborhood of the wellbore. But in the more
   distant observation wells and in depth intervals more vertically
   separated from the production wells, long-term depletion was not
   observed, indicating that significant reservoir depletion did not occur.
   These pressure gauges were sharply pressurized during stimulation, which
   implies that injection fluid reached these wells during fracturing, but
   proppant was not transported to the wells and the unpropped fractures
   subsequently closed and lost their conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been used as a common and powerful
   tool for petrophysical investigation of fluid-bearing porous media. A
   major complication of NMR analysis occurs, however, when diffusion of
   fluid protons through magnetic field heterogeneities becomes
   nonnegligible. A quantity called the secular relaxation rate (1/T-2 sec)
   has been defined as the difference in transverse and longitudinal
   relaxation rates (1/T-2-1/T-1) and can be shown to isolate the effects
   of diffusion as a function of pore system parameters. We have developed
   results that extract internal magnetic field gradient strengths based on
   changes in T-2 (sec) as a function of the NMR interecho spacing. We also
   indicated that an optimization algorithm can be used to invert for
   volumetrically weighted mean pore sizes. The benefit of these types of
   analyses is to provide simple methodologies for inferring the average
   strengths of internal magnetic field gradients and pore sizes from NMR
   measurements without the need for independent measurements of pore size,
   such as from mercury injection porosimetry. In addition, secular
   relaxation analysis removes complicating effects provided by bulk fluid
   and other nondiffusion relaxation mechanisms.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{264-290}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this work a theoretical framework implementing the phase-field
   approach to fracture is used to couple the physics of flow through
   porous media and cracks with the mechanics of fracture. The main
   modeling challenge addressed in this work, which is a challenge for all
   diffuse crack representations, is on how to allow for the flow of fluid
   and the action of fluid pressure on the aggregate within the diffuse
   damage zone of the cracks. The theory is constructed by presenting the
   general physical balance laws and conducting a consistent thermodynamic
   analysis to constrain the constitutive relationships. Constitutive
   equations that reproduce the desired responses at the various limits of
   the phase-field parameter are proposed in. order to capture Darcy-type
   flow in the intact porous medium and Stokes-type flow within open
   cracks. A finite element formulation for the solution of the governing
   model equations is presented and discussed. Finally, the theoretical and
   numerical model is shown to compare favorably to several important
   analytical solutions. More complex and interesting calculations are also
   presented to illustrate some of the advantageous features of the
   approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The structure, stability, and reorganization of lamella-forming block
   copolymer thin film surface topography ({''}islands{''} and ``holes{''})
   were studied under boundary conditions driving the formation of 0.5 L-0
   thick structures at short thermal annealing times. Self-consistent field
   theory predicts that the presence of one perfectly neutral surface
   renders 0.5 L-0 topography thermodynamically stable relative to 1 L-0
   thick features, in agreement with previous experimental observations.
   The calculated through-film structures match cross-sectional scanning
   electron micrographs, collectively demonstrating the pinning of edge
   dislocations at the neutral surface. Remarkably, near-neutral surface
   compositions exhibit 0.5 L-0 topography metastability upon extended
   thermal treatment, slowly transitioning to 1 L-0 islands or holes as
   evidenced by optical and atomic force microscopy. Surface restructuring
   is rationalized by invoking commensurability effects imposed by slightly
   preferential surfaces. The results described herein clarify the impact
   of interfacial interactions on block copolymer self-assembly and
   solidify an understanding of 0.5 L-0 topography, which is frequently
   used to determine neutral surface compositions of considerable
   importance to contemporary technological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g(-1) via a
   distinct conversion reaction, which is different from the insertion
   reactions in commercial lithium-ion batteries. In consideration of its
   conversion reaction battery chemistry, a custom design for electrode
   materials could establish the way for attaining high-loading capability
   while simultaneously maintaining high electrochemical utilization and
   stability. In this study, this process is undertaken by introducing
   carbon cotton as an attractive electrode-containment material for
   enhancing the dynamic and static stabilities of lithium-sulfur (Li-S)
   batteries. The carbon cotton possessing a hierarchical
   macro-/microporous architecture exhibits a high surface area of 805 m(2)
   g(-1) and high microporosity with a micropore area of 557 m(2) g(-1).
   The macroporous channels allow the carbon cotton to load and stabilize a
   high amount of active material. The abundant microporous reaction sites
   spread throughout the carbon cotton facilitate the redox chemistry of
   the high-loading/content Li-S system. As a result, the high-loading
   carbon-cotton cathode exhibits (i) enhanced cycle stability with a good
   dynamic capacity retention of 70\% after 100 cycles and (ii) improved
   cell storage stability with a high static capacity retention of above
   93\% and a low time-dependent self-discharge rate of 0.12\% per day
   after storing for a long period of 60 days. These carbon-cotton cathodes
   with the remarkably highest values reported so far of both sulfur
   loading (61.4 mg cm(-2)) and sulfur content (80 wt \%) demonstrate
   enhanced electrochemical utilization with the highest areal, volumetric,
   and gravimetric capacities simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the static and dynamic aeroelastic behavior of a
   thin ribbon that is used as an extremely flexible helicopter rotor
   blade. The non-dimensional torsional stiffness of this rotor blade is
   three orders of magnitude lower than that of a conventional helicopter
   rotor blade. As a result, the rotor blade undergoes large torsional
   deformation and its static and dynamic behavior are dominated by
   centrifugal forces. An aeroelastic analysis is developed based on Euler
   Bernoulli beam theory including large twist angles and unsteady
   aerodynamics including the effect of returning wake. The flow is assumed
   to be attached at all times, and only classical divergence and flutter
   stability are evaluated. The analysis is validated with deformation
   measurements of a 23 cm diameter rotor with ribbon blades. Divergence
   and flutter stability boundaries are identified, and the effects of
   rotational speed, rotor diameter, location of blade center of gravity
   and blade pitch are discussed. The analysis can be used as a design tool
   for flexible ribbon rotors in a variety of missions.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasting water breakthrough is a difficult task to be performed for
   naturally fractured reservoirs. Modeling flow through natural fractures
   is computationally intensive for a rigorously refined model. Hence, in
   many cases, it is not feasible to perform a full-field simulation
   considering the possibility of fracture reactivation.
   This work aims at applying a methodology to incorporate the flow through
   fractures or geomechanically active fractures in a full-field model
   using a commercial reservoir simulator. This is accomplished by tracking
   which grid blocks in a model cross the activated fractures followed by
   the redefinition of interblock transmissibilities. These
   transmissibilities are calculated using the cubic law that relates fluid
   flow with the fracture aperture and an average distance between crossed
   blocks. The methodology is well known as Embedded Discrete Fracture
   Model (EDFM) (Moinfar, 2013; Moinfar et al., 2014; Li et al., 2009).
   An in-house finite element geomechanical simulator, one-way coupled with
   a commercial reservoir simulator, was used to predict in-situ stresses.
   The classical Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was employed to calculate
   fracture shear strength. The natural fracture, or a segment of the
   fracture, is considered permeable when the applied stress is greater
   than its shear strength.
   Various case studies indicate the efficiency and accuracy of the EDFM
   method in a commercial simulator. In order to demonstrate the accuracy
   of the method, studies were performed in five spot models, comparing the
   results to those with a rigorously refined fracture representation. In
   order to highlight the applicability of the methodology at a
   field-scale, three reservoir simulation case studies are presented: one
   comparison with the dual permeability method, one simulation of a giant
   field, and one simulation coupled with a geomechanical simulator. The
   results show that the representation of natural fractures in reservoir
   models may drastically change the production forecast, especially in
   terms of water production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modeling dynamic fracture growth induced by non-Newtonian polymer
   injection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{395-407}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Injection of viscous polymer solutions can lead to excessive wellbore
   pressure and dynamic fracture growth near wellbore which hence increases
   polymer injectivity. Polymer rheology can also play an important role in
   affecting the fracture growth due to the dramatic variation of fluid
   velocity. However, current reservoir simulations for chemical flooding
   generally overlook the induced fracture, which may lead to inaccurate
   modeling of polymer floods. In this paper, we developed a new
   polymer-injection-induced fracture model based on the GdK fracture
   model, and implicitly coupled it to a general-purpose chemical flood
   simulator. Mathematical description of the fracture mechanics is
   presented with consideration of different polymer rheology. The new
   model is used to simulate polymer floods in a five-spot field. The
   fracture growth predicted by the new model is verified against a
   semi-analytical numerical fracture model. The simulation results using
   the new model indicate that the fracture growth has positive effects on
   improving injectivity, pressure drop, oil recovery, etc. Also, the
   simulations illustrate for the first time how polymer rheology affects
   fracture growth during polymer injection, e.g., without consideration of
   polymer shear-thickening can postpone the prediction of fracture
   initiation. The simulations successfully explain why polymer can be
   economically injected in real polymer fields. The new simulator can be
   used to optimize polymer floods concerning polymer injectivity, impact
   of fracture growth on sweeping efficiency, flow out of zone, and others.

Title = {{Depth variation of wettability alteration during oil-base mud-filtrate
   invasion and corresponding effects on resistivity logs}},

Abstract = {{Resistivity logs acquired in hydrocarbon-bearing formations invaded by
   oil-base mud (OBM) often indicate abnormally high values of mobile water
   saturation. It is not possible to explain such abnormally high values of
   water saturation with saturation-height analysis. The common explanation
   invokes rock wettability alterations due to surfactants included in
   oil-base mud-filtrate (OBMF). A quantitative study is needed to explain
   whether the interaction of OBMF surfactants with water-wetted grains can
   cause a sufficiently large increase in mobile water saturation in the
   near-wellbore region to affect resistivity logs. In this paper, we use a
   near wellbore simulator to model the processes of mud-filtrate invasion
   and ensuing wettability alteration once emulsifiers included in OBMF
   make contact with grain surfaces. We assume a wettability alteration
   model in which the degree and type of alteration are governed by the
   pore-volume concentration of emulsifier in OBMF within the invaded
   formation. Results indicate surfactants included in OBMF may change the
   rock's surface wettability from a water-wet to a neutral or oil wet
   condition. This behavior causes a fraction of the originally residual
   pore volume of connate water to become moveable. The radial displacement
   of movable water by OBMF can give rise to an annulus of water bank,
   which in turn causes the resistivity annulus. We perform simulations of
   OBMF invasion into oil and gas saturated formations. Simulated apparent
   resistivity logs across layers which exhibited shallow invasion showed a
   reverse OBM effect where deep resistivity was larger than shallow
   resistivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive laboratory evolution typically involves the propagation of
   organisms asexually to select for mutants with the desired phenotypes.
   However, asexual evolution is prone to competition among beneficial
   mutations (clonal interference) and the accumulation of hitchhiking and
   neutral mutations. The benefits of horizontal gene transfer toward
   overcoming these known disadvantages of asexual evolution were
   characterized in a strain of Escherichia coli engineered for superior
   sexual recombination (genderless). Specifically, we experimentally
   validated the capacity of the genderless strain to reduce the mutational
   load and recombine beneficial mutations. We also confirmed that
   inclusion of multiple origins of transfer influences both the frequency
   of genetic exchange throughout the chromosome and the linkage of donor
   DNA. We built a simple kinetic model to estimate recombination frequency
   as a function of transfer size and relative genotype enrichment in batch
   transfers; the model output correlated well with the experimental data.
   Our results provide strong support for the advantages of utilizing the
   genderless strain over its asexual counterpart during adaptive
   laboratory evolution for generating beneficial mutants with reduced
   mutational load.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new model and solution procedure for a problem
   that arises in configuring package sorting centers that perform multiple
   automated sorts per day. For a given set of loading bays, the first
   objective is to assign destinations to consecutive doors so that the
   number of changes of destination-to-door assignments from one sort to
   the next is minimized. The second and third objectives are to minimize
   the number of loaders who work the doors and to evenly distribute the
   volume of packages assigned to each loader. A variety of constraints
   vastly complicates these assignments and leads to a mixed-integer
   programming (MIP) model, which we significantly strengthened with
   structurally derived cuts. A novel feature of the formulation is the use
   of pattern variables to represent the door assignments. Taking a
   multiobjective programming approach, solutions are obtained by solving a
   series of MIPs, each addressing one of the three objectives. The
   effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using data provided by a
   well-known package carrier for 24 work centers in four facilities. An
   additional contribution is a complexity analysis of the
   destination-to-door and the loader-to-door assignment subproblems. Both
   are shown to be strongly NP-hard. We also examine special cases of the
   loader subproblem and develop polynomial-time algorithms for them.}},

Abstract = {{The Ni-rich layered oxides with a Ni content of >0.5 are drawing much
   attention recently to increase the energy density of lithium-ion
   batteries. However, the Ni-rich layered oxides suffer from aggressive
   reaction of the cathode surface with the organic electrolyte at the
   higher operating voltages, resulting in consequent impedance rise and
   capacity fade. To overcome this difficulty, we present here a
   heterostructure composed of a Ni-rich LiNi0.7Co0.15Mn0.15O2 core and a
   Li-rich Li1.2-xNi0.2Mn0.6O2 shell, incorporating the advantageous
   features of the structural stability of the core and chemical stability
   of the shell. With a unique chemical treatment for the activation of the
   Li2MnO3 phase of the shell, a high capacity is realized with the Li-rich
   shell material. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron
   microscopy (STEM) provides direct evidence for the formation of surface
   Li-rich shell layer. As a result, the heterostructure exhibits a high

   humanized antibodies, hu1B7 and hu11E6, bind distinct epitopes on PTx
   and, when coadministered, mitigate disease severity in murine and baboon
   models of infection. Here we describe the generation of a bispecific
   human IgG1 molecule combining the hu1B7 and hu11E6 binding sites via a
   knobs-in-holes design. The bispecific antibody showed binding activity
   equivalent to that of the antibody mixture in a competition
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A CHO cell neutralization
   assay provided preliminary evidence for synergy between the two
   antibodies, while a murine model of PTx-induced leukocytosis
   definitively showed synergistic neutralization. Notably, the bispecific
   antibody retained the synergy observed for the antibody mixture,
   supporting the conclusion that synergy is due to simultaneous blockade
   of both the catalytic and receptor binding activities of pertussis
   toxin. These data suggest that a hu1B7/hu11E6 bispecific antibody is a
   viable alternative to an antibody mixture for pertussis treatment.}},

Abstract = {{pH-responsive, polyanionic nanoscale hydrogels were developed for the
   oral delivery of hydrophobic therapeutics, such as common
   chemotherapeutic agents. Nanoscale hydrogels were designed to overcome
   physicochemical and biological barriers associated with oral delivery of
   hydrophobic therapeutics such as low solubility and poor permeability
   due to P-glycoprotein related drug efflux. Synthesis of these nanoscale
   materials was achieved by a robust photoemulsion polymerization method.
   By varying hydrophobic monomer components, four formulations were
   synthesized and screened for optimal physicochemical properties and in
   vitro biocompatibility. All of the responsive nanoscale hydrogels were
   capable of undergoing a pH-dependent transition in size. Depending on
   the selection of the hydrophobic monomer, the sizes of the nanoparticles
   vary widely from 120 nm to about 500 nm at pH 7.4. Polymer composition
   was verified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
   H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Polymer biocompatibility
   was assessed in vitro with an intestinal epithelial cell model. All
   formulations were found to have no appreciable cytotoxicity, defined as
   greater than 80\% viability after polymer incubation. We demonstrate
   that these nanoscale hydrogels possess desirable physicochemical
   properties and exhibit agreeable in vitro biocompatibility for oral
   delivery applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A mostly digital pulsewidth-modulator-based delta-sigma (Delta Sigma)
   analog-to-digital converter is proposed. This system takes advantage of
   the duration of pulses, rather than voltage or current, as the analog
   operand used in its closed-loop operation. Therefore, circuits that
   process the pulses are digital in nature and improve with scaling.
   Furthermore, the architecture allows inherently matched multibit
   quantizer/digital-to-analog converter (DAC) blocks by taking advantage
   of delay lines reusable in both quantization and DAC operation. A second
   novelty of this architecture is the modulator's adaptive excess delay,
   which synchronizes the asynchronous loop with an external reference
   clock. This mitigates the problems associated with nonuniform sampling.
   A first-order 3-b prototype of this architecture is presented. The core
   occupies an area of 0.0275 mm(2) in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process, consumes
   2.7 mW, and measures a 45.1-dB SNR over a 2-MHz bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we examined a structural transition from three-dimensional
   to two-dimensional in the CnB6-nH6 (n = 0-6) series. The searches for

   optimizations at the hybrid density functional B3LYP/6-311++G{*}{*}
   level of theory along with single-point CCSD(T) calculations were
   carried out to estimate relative energies. We found that 3D-2D
   transition occurs at n = 5 (C5BH6). Moreover, the stability of clusters
   is discussed on the basis of the binding energy per atom, second-order
   energy difference, adiabatic ionization potential, HOMO-LUMO energy gap
   and polarizability. Based on the simultaneous criteria of high binding
   energy, high band gap, high adiabatic ionization potential and low
   polarizability, it is found that C2B4H6 cluster has a higher stability.

   drilling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{46-57}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The problem considered in this paper is that of controlling downhole
   pressure during oil and gas well drilling, with a particular focus on
   handling gas kicks leading to two-phase gas-liquid flow conditions. We
   identify a first-order approximation to the infinite-dimensional system
   which captures the dominating mode of the pressure dynamics in the
   frequency range of interest, while the high-frequency pressure dynamics
   are represented by a multiplicative uncertainty. This approximation is
   then modified to accommodate the changes to the dynamics introduced by
   the two-phase flow. The linearized plant has an open-loop time constant
   which varies between 2 and 600 s depending on operating point and gas
   distribution in the well. Robust controller design is then performed
   using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) via a polytopic norm-bounded
   description of both the high-frequency multiplicative, and the low
   frequency parametric uncertainty. It is shown that, in order to achieve
   acceptable performance over such a large range of open loop time
   constants, a time-varying controller gain is required. The main
   contribution of the paper is to achieve this control objective
   systematically by formulating the control design problem as an LMI
   optimization problem. Then optimal solutions of the LMI problem can be
   obtained in polynomial time by using modern interior point method (IPM)
   numerical solution algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We report the first direct dry transfer of a single crystalline thin
   film grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A double cantilever beam fracture
   technique was used to transfer epitaxial bismuth thin films grown on
   silicon (111) to silicon strips coated with epoxy. The transferred
   bismuth films retained electrical, optical, and structural properties
   comparable to the as grown epitaxial films. Additionally, we isolated
   the bismuth thin films on freestanding flexible cured-epoxy
   post-transfer. The adhesion energy at the bismuth/silicon interface was
   measured to be similar to 1 J/m(2), comparable to that of exfoliated and
   wet transferred graphene. This low adhesion energy and ease of transfer
   is unexpected for an epitaxially grown film and may enable the study of
   bismuth's unique electronic and spintronic properties on arbitrary
   substrates. Moreover, this method suggests a route to integrate other
   group-V epitaxial films (i.e., phosphorus) with arbitrary substrates, as
   well as potentially to isolate bismuthene, the atomic thin-film limit of
   bismuth.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur batteries are considered as a promising candidate for
   high energy density storage applications. However, their specific
   capacity and cyclic stability are hindered by poor conductivity of
   sulfur and the dissolution of redox intermediates. Here, we design
   polypyrrole-MnO2 coaxial nanotubes to encapsulate sulfur, in which MnO2
   restrains the shuttle effect of polysulfides greatly through
   chemisorption and polypyrrole serves as conductive frameworks. The
   polypyrrole-MnO2 nanotubes are synthesized through in situ
   polymerization of pyrrole using MnO2 nanowires as both template and
   oxidization initiator. A stable Coulombic efficiency of similar to
   98.6\% and a decay rate of 0.07\% per cycle along with 500 cycles at
   1C-rate are achieved for S/PPy-MnO2 ternary electrodes with 70 wt \% of
   S and 5 wt \% of MnO2. The excellent trapping ability of MnO2 to
   polysulfides and tubular structure of polypyrrole with good flexibility
   and conductivity are responsible for the significantly improved cyclic
   stability and rate capability.}},

Title = {{Temporal Patterns of In-Hospital Falls of Elderly Patients}},
Journal = {{NURSING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{435-445}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: A potentially important factor yet to receive adequate study
   is the time when hospital falls occur. A prior study conducted before
   the system-wide introduction of preventive measures revealed a biphasic
   24-hour pattern of hospital falls with major peak in the morning.
   Objectives: The purpose was to identify the temporal patterning of falls
   among elderly patients in hospitals with comprehensive fall prevention
   programs in place.
   Methods: A 4-year observational study was conducted by the local health
   authority in the five nonteaching public hospitals located in the
   province of Ferrara, Italy. Fall records involving patients of ages >=
   65 years hospitalized in the general medical departments were used.
   Single-and multiple-component cosinor (time series) analyses were used
   to explore 24-hour, weekly, and annual patterns of falls.
   Results: A total of 763 falls were experienced by 709 different elderly
   hospitalized patients. Falls typically took place in the patient's
   hospital room (72\%) and bathroom (23\%). Major causes were patient
   instability (32\%) and accident (13\%), and most occurred when not
   wearing footwear (45\%) or wearing inappropriate sling-back open-toe
   shoes (39\%). Falls happened while standing (39\%), while seated (21\%),
   and while getting into, out of, or laying in bed (32\%)-either with the
   bed rails raised or lowered. Fall outcome usually involved no injury
   (58\%) or slight injury (35\%), but some (7\%) were disabling. Fall
   occurrence was higher during the night (46\%) compared to either the
   morning (30\%) or afternoon (24\%) shift. Patterns across 24 hours were
   characterized by a single major and one or more minor peaks that seemed
   to be associated with a variety of scheduled patient, hospital, and
   nursing activities. Multiple-component cosinor analysis identified
   significant (p < .05) prominent day-night patterns according to fall
   location, patient position, cause, injury severity, and type of
   footwear. Falls were more frequent, but not significantly so, on
   Fridays, Sundays, and Mondays compared with Tuesdays, and were more
   frequent in winter and spring (p = .003).
   Discussion: Documentation by cause and circumstance of these moderate-to
   high-amplitude temporal patterns in hospital falls of elderly patients
   advances the knowledge of fall epidemiology by identifying the times of
   day, week, and year and nursing shifts of elevated risk that is of
   critical importance to improving hospital patient safety programs.}},

Abstract = {{We present a microeconomic model for time use and consumption for
   workers with an improved treatment of the (technical) relations between
   goods and time. In addition to the traditional time and income
   constraints, an improved set of restrictions involving explicit
   relations between consumption of goods and time assigned to activities
   is included in two versions. In each version, a system of equations
   involving a subset of the consumer's decision variables is obtained,
   including (1) work time, (2) activities that are assigned more time than
   the minimum, and (3) goods that are consumed above the minimum. The
   system cannot be solved explicitly in the endogenous decision variables
   but is used to set a stochastic system for econometric estimation
   through maximum likelihood. The models are applied to analyze weekly
   time use and consumption data from Netherlands for year 2012. The
   results obtained by this new ``goods and time{''} framework are compared
   with previous research in terms of the value of leisure and the value of
   work, showing substantial differences in the valuation of time. (C) 2016

Title = {{Vehicular ad-hoc network simulations of overtaking maneuvers on two-lane
   rural highways}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{60-76}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
   dedicated short-range communication (DSRC)-based wireless
   vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system, called the overtaking
   assistant, devised for improving safety during overtaking (also referred
   to as passing) maneuvers on two-lane rural highways. Specifically, the
   paper examines the influence of vehicular kinematics (vehicle speeds,
   accelerations and distances), driver behavior (drivers'
   perception/reaction time and overtaking rate), and DSRC characteristics
   (power settings, communication range, packet errors, sensor errors, and
   estimation inaccuracy) on the effectiveness of DSRC systems in
   predicting unsafe overtaking maneuvers. To this end, the paper utilizes
   a microscopic traffic simulator called VEhicles In Network Simulation
   (VEINS) that supports the simulation of wireless communication protocols
   in Vehicular Ad-hoc NEtworks (VANETs). 18,000 overtaking maneuvers -
   with roughly 10,000 collision maneuvers - were simulated to consider
   heterogeneity in vehicular kinematics, driver behavior, and DSRC
   performance. The overtaking assistant predicts whether a collision will
   occur and warns the driver before the maneuver begins. A descriptive
   analysis followed by a multivariate analysis (using binary discrete
   outcome models) of the simulated data reveals that the majority of
   collisions that could not be detected were due to the vehicles being out
   of communication range for the communication power settings used in the
   simulation. Packet errors, or failed communications, at a rate of up to
   50\% did not have a significant influence on the ability to detect
   collisions. These results suggest that the most important step in paving
   the way toward advanced driver assistance systems for rural highway
   overtaking maneuvers is to broaden the communication range of DSRC
   devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the development of a 5 mm, piezo-actuated, ultrafast laser
   scalpel for fast tissue microsurgery. Delivery of micro-Joules level
   energies to the tissue was made possible by a large, 31 mu m, air-cored
   inhibited-coupling Kagome fiber. We overcome the fiber's low NA by using
   lenses made of high refractive index ZnS, which produced an optimal
   focusing condition with 0.23 NA objective. The optical design achieved a
   focused laser spot size of 4.5 mu m diameter covering a 75 x 75 mu m(2)
   scan area in a miniaturized setting. The probe could deliver the maximum
   available laser power, achieving an average fluence of 7.8 J/cm(2) on
   the tissue surface at 62\% transmission efficiency. Such fluences could
   produce uninterrupted, 40 mu m deep cuts at translational speeds of up
   to 5 mm/s along the tissue. We predicted that the best combination of
   speed and coverage exists at 8 mm/s for our conditions. The onset of
   nonlinear absorption in ZnS, however, limited the probe's energy
   delivery capabilities to 1.4 mu J for linear operation at 1.5 picosecond
   pulse-widths of our fiber laser. Alternatives like broadband CaF2
   crystals should mitigate such nonlinear limiting behavior. Improved
   opto-mechanical design and appropriate material selection should allow
   substantially higher fluence delivery and propel such Kagome fiber-based
   scalpels towards clinical translation. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{The three-part study described in this paper involved a detailed
   evaluation of fire statistics from four countries to compare the number
   of deaths and injuries from structure fires started by a small open
   flame ignition source to casualty counts from fires started by smoking
   materials. First, a qualitative multi-national comparison of low-energy
   and smoking materials ignition fires is made based on fire statistics
   obtained from the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and Finland for the period
   between 2002 and 2012. From this comparison it can be concluded that,
   compared to the other nations, the U.K. appears to have more of a
   problem with smoking materials ignition fires resulting in fatalities;
   and that Japan appears to have appreciably more smoking materials
   ignition fires, but not fatalities from such fires, than the other
   nations. A more detailed quantitative analysis is then performed to
   examine the contribution of low-energy (match, lighter, space heater,
   etc.) versus smoking materials (cigar, pipe, cigarette, etc.) ignition
   to the U.S. fire problem. An attempt was made to address two issues with
   the U.S. NFIRS database, i.e., the fact that it is based on a voluntary
   sample of U.S. fire department incident reports and that many of the
   data categories relevant to the present study contain unknown fields.
   From this analysis it is apparent that smoking materials ignition fires
   tend to more commonly result in fatalities than low-energy ignition
   fires, while the overall volume of low-energy ignition fires and
   corresponding losses and injuries are greater. Finally, a logistic
   regression model is presented that can be used to predict the
   probability that a fire resulting in a fatality was started by
   low-energy ignition based on the age and race of the victim, the item
   first ignited, and the season in the year when the fire took place. The
   model indicates that older persons are generally more susceptible to
   perishing in a fire resulting from smoking materials ignition rather
   than low-energy ignition.}},

Abstract = {{We perform an optimization and sensitivity analysis for design of an
   Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) with horizontal wells and multiple
   fracturing stages. The sensitivity analysis includes calculations of
   thermal breakthrough and the maximum flow rate that can be achieved
   through the system. The analysis uses idealized reservoir geometry and
   is intended to investigate the relationship between parameters and
   provide insight into how to optimize an EGS, not to provide precise
   predictions of performance. Conventionally, EGS wells have been nearly
   vertical and stimulated with openhole completion in a single stage. This
   study investigates a design with two parallel horizontal wells. The
   first well is drilled and completed with casing, and then stimulated
   sequentially in stages with cased hole packers rated to high
   temperature. The second well is drilled through the stimulated region
   created around the first well and completed openhole. For different
   combinations of well spacing, lateral length, formation permeability,
   and number of stages, we calculate the optimal flow rate that maximizes
   the present value of revenue. The calculations show that stimulating
   with multiple stages greatly improves economic performance, delays
   thermal breakthrough, and allows a higher flow rate to be circulated
   through the system. At low well spacing and low number of stages, it is
   optimal to circulate fluid more slowly than the maximum possible rate in
   order to delay thermal breakthrough. With greater well spacing and with
   more stages, thermal breakthrough is relatively delayed, and it is
   optimal to circulate at the maximum possible flow rate. Overall, it is
   optimal to use the lowest well spacing where present value is maximized
   by circulating at the maximum possible rate. When it is optimal to
   circulate at the maximum possible rate, present value is sensitive to
   reservoir transmissivity. When it is optimal to circulate at less than
   the maximum possible rate, present value is unaffected by reservoir
   transmissivity. Increasing lateral length beyond 1000 m is only
   beneficial for designs with relatively low lateral spacing and a large
   number of stages. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{387-406}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{With sizes larger than molecules but smaller than colloidal particles,
   nanoparticles exhibit unique transport properties in porous media. They
   can easily pass through typical pore throats in reservoir formations
   with micron diameters, but may get retained by physicochemical
   interaction with the pore walls. Based on detailed analysis of
   nanoparticle retention data from an extensive series of transport
   experiments, we examine the limitations of classical models of transport
   and interaction with a stationary phase. Some features of nanoparticle
   transport and retention are similar to those of adsorbing/desorbing
   solutes, while others are similar to those of depositing colloids. But
   neither solute sorption nor colloid filtration alone can explain all
   nanoparticle retention features, and of particular importance for
   subsurface applications, neither model can predict the effect of
   changing flow conditions on nanoparticle retention. The model that
   accounts for most observations is an independent two-site model which
   postulates physically independent sites of fixed capacity: one for
   reversible attachment and the other for irreversible attachment. We
   validate the model against five distinctly different groups of
   experimental data from the literature, through a rigorous approach of
   obtaining the model parameters from one experiment and blind testing
   against data from other experiments when experimental conditions vary.}},

Title = {{A habitat similarity model based on vague sets to assess Schizothorax
   prenanti spawning habitat}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{86-93}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti) is a second-class provincial
   protected endemic fish within the upper reaches of the Min River. The
   spawning season of S. prenanti extends from March to April. Habitat
   alteration and the construction of multistage dams have resulted in a
   rapid decline of the S. prenanti population. To assess the potential
   effects of a reduced flow volume on the S. prenanti spawning habitat
   area in downstream of dams, we combined River 2D and a habitat
   similarity evaluation model through the following steps. First, we
   conducted surveys of S. prenanti and the substrate composition in a
   natural habitat reach and a hydropower-affected reach. Second, hydraulic
   simulations were performed over a range of flows using River 2D. Third,
   vague sets of habitat variables were individually defined based on
   multi-expert opinions. Fourth, we estimated the weighted similarity of
   the S. prenanti spawning habitat using input variables (water depth,
   velocity) from River 2D. Fifth, we verified the model with S. prenanti
   survey data. Hydraulic simulations for velocity and depth yielded
   accuracies of approximately 84-97\% and 81-98\%, respectively. The
   weighted similarity simulations showed that weighted similarity
   increased with the flow up to a threshold range of approximately 130-150
   m(3)/s; beyond this range, the weighted similarity decreased. The
   weighted similarity in the natural habitat reach was higher than in the
   restored reach at the same flow volume due to geography. The habitat
   similarity model provides restoration targets and thresholds for
   decision makers to develop a proactive conservation strategy for wetland
   management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Longstanding persistent (LSP) atrial fibrillation (AF) is the
   most challenging type of AF. In addition to pulmonary vein isolation,
   substrate modification and triggers ablation have been reported to
   improve freedom from AF in patients with LSPAF.
   OBJECTIVES This study sought to assess whether the empirical electrical
   isolation of the left atrial appendage (LAA) could improve success at
   follow-up.
   METHODS This was an open-label, randomized study assessing the
   effectiveness of empirical electrical left atrial appendage isolation
   for the treatment of LSPAF. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo
   empirical electrical left atrial appendage isolation along with
   extensive ablation (group 1; n = 85) or extensive ablation alone (group
   2; n = 88). Recurrence of atrial arrhythmias was the primary endpoint.
   Secondary endpoints included cardiac-related hospitalization, all-cause
   mortality, and stroke at follow-up.
   RESULTS Major clinical characteristics were not different between the 2
   groups. At 12-month follow-up, 48 (56\%) patients in group 1 and 25
   (28\%) in group 2 were recurrence free after a single procedure
   (unadjusted hazard ratio {[}HR] for recurrence with standard ablation:
   1.92; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.3 to 2.9; log-rank p = 0.001).
   After adjusting for age, sex, and left atrial size, standard ablation
   was predictive of recurrence (HR: 2.22; 95\% CI: 1.29 to 3.81; p =
   0.004). During repeat procedures, empirical electrical left atrial
   appendage isolation was performed in all patients. After an average of
   1.3 procedures, cumulative success at 24-month follow-up was reported in
   65 (76\%) in group 1 and in 49 (56\%) in group 2 (unadjusted HR: 2.24;
   95\% CI: 1.3 to 3.8; log-rank p = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS This randomized study showed that both after a single
   procedure and after redo procedures in patients with LSPAF, empirical
   electrical isolation of the LAA improved long-term freedom from atrial
   arrhythmias without increasing complications. (Effect of Empirical Left
   Atrial Appendage Isolation on Long-term Procedure Outcome in Patients

   performance characteristics and exhaust gas emissions for a
   four-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged, direct injection diesel engine

   rapeseed oil methyl ester (B100), rapeseed oil methyl ester diesel blend
   (20-80\% in vol, B20) and diesel fuel. Transesterification and
   microemulsion methods were used to produce rapeseed oil methyl ester and
   diesel rapeseed oil n-butanol blends, respectively. The engine
   performance and exhaust emission tests were conducted employing each of
   DRSOnB, B100, B20 and diesel fuel, with the engine operating at full
   load and eight different engine speeds between 1800 and 4400 rpm. As
   compared to diesel fuel, the test fuels decreased torque, brake power
   and exhaust gas temperature and increased brake specific fuel
   consumption (BSFC). While B20 and DRSOnB blends increased carbon
   monoxide (CO) emissions, B100 decreased it compared to diesel fuel. All
   the test fuels reduced hydrocarbon (HC) emissions while increasing
   nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation. (C) 2015 Energy Institute. Published by

   effect of various therapies. The most challenging aspects of this
   endeavor is that all of these issues often involve confounding
   uncertainties: in observational data, in model parameters, in model
   selection, and in the features targeted in the prediction. Our approach
   can be referred to as ``model agnostic{''} in that no single model is
   advocated; rather, a general approach that explores powerful
   mixture-theory representations of tissue behavior while accounting for a
   range of relevant biological factors is presented, which leads to many
   potentially predictive models. Then representative classes are
   identified which provide a starting point for the implementation of
   OPAL, the Occam Plausibility Algorithm (OPAL) which enables the modeler
   to select the most plausible models (for given data) and to determine if
   the model is a valid tool for predicting tumor growth and morphology (in
   vivo). All of these approaches account for uncertainties in the model,
   the observational data, the model parameters, and the target QOI. We
   demonstrate these processes by comparing a list of models for tumor
   growth, including reaction-diffusion models, phase-fields models, and
   models with and without mechanical deformation effects, for glioma
   growth measured in murine experiments. Examples are provided that
   exhibit quite acceptable predictions of tumor growth in laboratory
   animals while demonstrating successful implementations of OPAL.}},

Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Regulatory intervention is one of the most influential factors in
   preventing occupational safety in the construction industry. In 2002,
   the United States (US) Occupational Safety and Health Administration
   (OSHA) revised the steel erection standard, which is designed to protect
   employees from steel erection related hazards. The purpose of this study
   was to examine a measurable impact of the revised OSHA 29 CFR 1926,
   Subpart R using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This study
   identified four safety measures: fatality rate, days away injury rate,
   normalized fatality rate, and normalized days away injury rate.
   Descriptive and interrupted time series analyses were conducted to
   examine impacts of the revision of the standard on the safety of
   structural iron and steel workers. The findings indicate that fatality
   and days away injury rates of the structural iron and steel workers
   declined by 22.2\% and 53.7\%, respectively, after the implementation of
   the standard revision. In addition, two normalized safety indicators
   revealed that the reductions of fatality and days away injuries of the
   structural iron and steel workers were greater than those from the
   overall construction workers. This study provides evidence for the
   effectiveness of the revised standard in preventing overall occupational
   injuries in structural iron and steel workers in the US construction
   industry. In addition, the findings of this study demonstrate that the
   revised standard was more effective on preventing days away injuries
   than fatalities, which can guide future directions for policy makers and
   researchers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of tidal currents on delta-channel deepening, stratigraphic

Journal = {{GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Deltas are sensitive indicators of coastal processes (e.g., waves and
   tides) and show dynamic changes in shoreline morphology, distributary
   channel network, and stratigraphic architecture in response to coastal
   forcing. Numerical modeling has long been used to show delta evolution
   associated with a single dominant coastal process, but rarely to examine
   the sensitivity of deltas to mixed processes. Physics-based
   morphodynamic simulations (Delft3D) are used to investigate the
   influence of tidal currents on deltas. Tidal amplitude and the sand: mud
   ratio of subsurface sediment have been varied in the model. The results
   show that increasing tidal amplitude causes deeper and more stable
   distributary channels and more rugose plan-form shoreline patterns. A
   new metric for channel geometry quantifies tidal influence on the
   distributary channel network. Stable distributary channels act as an
   efficient mechanism for ebb-enhanced currents to (1) bypass sediment
   across the delta plain, and (2) extend channel tips seaward through
   mouth bar erosion. The basinward channel extension leads to sandier
   deposits in the tide-influenced deltas than in their river-dominated
   counterparts. The delta-front bathymetry also reflects sediment
   redistribution, changing the delta-front profile from concave to convex
   with compound geometries as tidal amplitude increases. These results
   suggest that channel overdeepening is a possible tidal signature that
   should be considered when interpreting ancient systems, and that sand
   may be bypassed much farther basinward in tide-influenced than in purely
   river-dominated deltas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a state dependent broadcast channel with one
   transmitter, Alice, and two receivers, Bob and Eve. The problem is to
   effectively convey ({''}amplify{''}) the channel state sequence to Bob
   while ``masking{''} it from Eve. The extent to which the state sequence
   cannot be masked from Eve is referred to as leakage. This can be viewed
   as a secrecy problem, where we desire that the channel state itself be
   minimally leaked to Eve while being communicated to Bob. This paper is
   aimed at characterizing the tradeoff region between amplification and
   leakage rates for such a system. An achievable coding scheme is
   presented, wherein the transmitter transmits a partial state information
   over the channel to facilitate the amplification process. For the case
   when Bob observes a stronger signal than Eve, the achievable coding
   scheme is enhanced with secure refinement. Outer bounds on the tradeoff
   region are also derived, and used in characterizing some special case
   results. In particular, the optimal amplification-leakage rate
   difference, called as differential amplification capacity, is
   characterized for the reversely degraded discrete memoryless channel,
   the degraded binary, and the degraded Gaussian channels. In addition,
   for the degraded Gaussian model, the extremal corner points of the
   tradeoff region are characterized, and the gap between the outer bound
   and achievable rate-regions is shown to be less than half a bit for a
   wide set of channel parameters.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid advancement of sensing and computing technology and the
   wide adoption of mobile computing, the construction industry has faced a
   rise in the amount of information and data generated during the
   lifecycle of the construction project. To deal with a large variety of
   project data and information to support efficient and effective decision
   making, visualization, information modeling, and simulation (VIMS) has
   become critical in the development of capital facilities and
   infrastructures. The objective of this paper is to identify and
   investigate grand challenges in VIMS for the construction industry, to
   assist the academic and industry communities in establishing a future
   research agenda to solve VIMS challenges. In particular, 17 VIMS grand
   challenges were identified by an expert task force in the VIMS committee
   of the ASCE Computing and Information Technology Division, and then VIMS
   experts in the civil and construction areas from both academia and
   industry participated in a survey to assess the identified challenges,
   examine the relative importance of the identified challenges, and
   investigate current practices and future directions of VIMS. The survey
   results indicate that several knowledge gaps regarding VIMS challenges
   between academia and industry still exist, and it is the contention of
   this research that these particular gaps need to be addressed in future
   research. These research directions apply to technical issues and
   sociological/cultural/organizational issues in VIMS challenges. The
   major contribution of this paper is its claim that the provision of
   shared views on VIMS challenges lays a firm foundation in which
   collaborative actions between academia and industry can take place,
   which will, in turn, advance VIMS for the construction industry. By
   incorporating the whole project lifecycle, not only project execution
   but also planning, operation, and maintenance, the analysis provides
   meaningful hints for VIMS challenges in architecture, engineering, and
   facility management industries.}},

Abstract = {{Commissioning and start-up (CSU) must be accomplished before a facility
   can initiate initial operations and begin meeting commercial objectives.
   Actions necessary for successful CSU are often not well planned or
   executed, resulting in poor CSU performance. Recognizing this
   significant shortfall, the purpose of this study is to determine
   critical activities necessary to increase the likelihood of successful
   CSU performance on capital projects. Utilizing input from CSU experts,
   objective data collection, and subsequent data analysis, 16 critical
   success factors (CSFs) were identified through this research. Further
   elements developed include CSF's timing of CSF implementation, support
   of safety and quality, and current frequency of CSF achievement. The
   researchers recommend the industry to pay particular attention to these
   six laggard CSFs: CSU value recognition, adequate funding for CSU, CSU
   leadership continuity, system milestone acceptance criteria and
   deliverables, CSU systems engineering during front-end engineering
   design (FEED), and systems-focus in detailed design. Capital project
   team members (representing both owners and contractors) and researchers
   involved in the planning and implementation of facility CSU will benefit
   from the results.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{807}},
Pages = {{155-166}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There exists significant demand for improved Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models that are informed by and can
   represent a richer set of turbulence physics. This paper presents a
   method of using deep neural networks to learn a model for the Reynolds
   stress anisotropy tensor from high-fidelity simulation data. A novel
   neural network architecture is proposed which uses a multiplicative
   layer with an invariant tensor basis to embed Galilean invariance into
   the predicted anisotropy tensor. It is demonstrated that this neural
   network architecture provides improved prediction accuracy compared with
   a generic neural network architecture that does not embed this
   invariance property. The Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions of this
   invariant neural network are propagated through to the velocity field
   for two test cases. For both test cases, significant improvement versus
   baseline RANS linear eddy viscosity and nonlinear eddy viscosity models
   is demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Surface-Wave Dispersion Approach for Evaluating Statistical Models That
   Account for Shear-Wave Velocity Uncertainty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A number of strategies exist to account for the epistemic uncertainty
   and aleatory variability in shear-wave velocity (Vs) profiles used in
   site response analyses. Epistemic uncertainty may be accounted for by
   using median and bounding-type profiles (e.g., +/- 20\%), while aleatory
   variability may be accounted for by using Vs randomization procedures. A
   robust, quantitative method to help judge how well these statistically
   derived Vs profiles represent actual subsurface stiffness or layering
   conditions is currently not available. This paper presents a
   surface-wave dispersion approach for evaluating statistical models meant
   to account for Vs uncertainty in site response. Specifically,
   surface-wave dispersion data from two geologically disparate sites were
   used to generate 1,000Vs profiles and layered earth models whose
   theoretical dispersion curves fit within the uncertainty bounds of the
   experimental data collected at each site. Additionally, theoretical
   dispersion curves generated from statistical Vs profiles such as the
   median, bounding-type, and randomly generated Vs profiles for each site
   were compared with the experimentally measured dispersion data. It was
   found that the theoretical dispersion curve from the median Vs profile
   provided a satisfactory fit to the experimental data, but the
   theoretical dispersion curves from bounding-type Vs profiles did not.
   Furthermore, randomly generated Vs profiles resulted in some theoretical
   dispersion curves that fit the experimental data and many that did not.
   The authors recommend comparing theoretical dispersion curves for
   candidate Vs profiles and layered earth models with the measured
   dispersion data at a site prior to using the candidate profiles to
   account for uncertainty in site response analyses as a quantitative way
   to judge if the Vs profiles represent realistic site conditions.}},

Title = {{Mapping Dispersion Misfit and Uncertainty in Vs Profiles to Variability
   in Site Response Estimates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Uncertainty in site response analyses can be attributed to a number of
   parameters, including analysis methods, input ground motions, nonlinear
   dynamic soil properties, and shear-wave velocity profiles. In this
   paper, several approaches commonly used to account for shear-wave
   velocity (Vs) uncertainty in site response are investigated.
   Specifically, the Vs profiles considered are categorized into three
   groups: (1)Vs profiles determined directly from surface-wave inversion,
   (2)simple statistical Vs profiles derived indirectly from the
   surface-wave Vs profiles (including bounding-type, median, and other
   percentile Vs profiles), and (3)statistically based, randomly generated
   Vs profiles. A companion paper discusses the development of these Vs
   profiles for two international blind-study sites. In this paper, the
   effects of using each approach to account for Vs uncertainty in site
   response are investigated by linking the dispersion misfit values for
   each Vs profile to variability in equivalent linear site response
   estimates. Clear trends exist between variability in site response
   estimates and dispersion misfit values at both sites. Thus, the
   experimental dispersion data can be used to help select suites of Vs
   profiles, generated either directly from inversion or through a
   randomization model, that account for uncertainty in a meaningful way
   without including unrealistic statistical profiles that result in too
   much site response variability.}},

Abstract = {{State transition matrices provide sensitivities or partial derivatives
   between states at different times along a trajectory and are used for a
   number of applications such as feedback controls, stability analysis,
   estimation, targeting, parameter optimization, and optimal control. The
   need for accurate state transition matrices is especially important for
   problems and applications that have highly sensitive and highly
   nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, examples are considered in the
   context of multiple-revolution and multiple-body space trajectories.
   Three techniques to compute both the first- and second-order state
   transition matrices are compared: 1)augmenting the state with the
   classic variational equations, 2)complex and bicomplex-step derivative
   approximation, and 3)multipoint stencils for traditional finite
   differences. Each of the methods are compared for accuracy and speed
   across a variety of problems and numerical integration techniques. The
   subtle differences between variable- and fixed-step integration for
   partial computation are revealed, common pitfalls are observed, and
   recommendations are made to enhance the quality of state transition
   matrices. A main result is the demonstration of small but potentially
   significant errors in the partials when they are computed with
   variational equations and a variable-step integrator.}},

Abstract = {{With a logical management of the catalyst selectivity, we present a
   scalable, membraneless alkaline direct liquid fuel cell (DLFC) platform.
   The uniqueness of this innovation is that the inexpensive (non platinum)
   cathode catalysts, based on strongly coupled transition-metal-oxide
   nanocrystals and nano structured carbon materials (e.g., NiCo2O4
   nano-particles on a nitrogen-doped graphene and MnNiCoO4 nano-particles
   on a nitrogen-doped multi-wall carbon nanotube), exhibit high activity
   for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but without activity for the
   anode fuel oxidation reaction (FOR). Therefore, operation of the DLFCs
   allows the anode fuel to freely enter the cathode. This strategy avoids
   the reliance on expensive or difficult-to-develop cation- or
   anion-exchange membranes and circumvents the scalability concerns of the
   conventional membraneless DLFCs that are operated under a laminar-flow
   principle. With proper catalyst selectivity, a variety of organic
   liquids can be used as anode fuels. The high power density delivered by
   the membraneless DLFCs with inexpensive components and safe fuels can
   enable the development of not only small-scale portable power sources
   but also large-scale energy generation systems for transportation and
   stationary storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to validate a simplified spin- and
   gradient-echo (sSAGE) approach to obtain T-1-corrected dynamic
   susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) data in a
   clinical brain tumor population. A five-echo SAGE sequence was used to
   acquire DSC-MRI data (n = 8 patients, 3 primary glioma, and 5 brain
   metastases). The Delta R-2{*} and Delta R-2 time series obtained from a
   nonlinear fit of all echoes (SAGE) were compared to Delta R-2{*} and
   Delta R-2 time series obtained analytically (sSAGE) using three echoes
   (two GEs and one SE). Through the use of multiple echoes, both methods
   removed T-1 leakage effects from the Delta R-2{*} and Delta R-2 time
   series, and the sSAGE Delta R-2{*} and Delta R-2 time series were highly
   correlated with those from SAGE, with average correlations of 0.9. The
   resulting hemodynamic parameters included GE and SE cerebral blood
   volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean vessel diameter (mVD),
   volume transfer constant (K-rans), and volume fraction of the
   extravascular extracellular space (v(e)). For each metric, there was
   good correlation (>0.86) between sSAGE and SAGE, with no significant
   differences. The sSAGE method provides T-1-corrected GE and SE DSC-MRI
   parameters in an efficient and clinically feasible manner. (C) 2016

Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Traction-separation relations can be used to represent the adhesive
   interactions of a bimaterial interface during fracture. In this paper, a
   direct method is proposed to determine mixed-mode traction-separation
   relations based on a combination of global and local measurements
   including load-displacement, crack extension, crack tip opening
   displacement, and fracture resistance curves. Mixed-mode interfacial
   fracture experiments were conducted using the end loaded split (ELS)
   configuration for a silicon-epoxy interface, where the epoxy thickness
   was used to control the phase angle of the fracture mode-mix. Infra-red
   crack opening interferometry was used to measure the normal crack
   opening displacements, while both normal and shear components of the
   crack-tip opening displacements were obtained by digital image
   correlation. For the resistance curves, an approximate value of the
   J-integral was calculated based on a beam-on-elastic-foundation model
   that referenced the measured load-displacement data. A damage-based
   cohesive zone model with mixed-mode traction-separation relations was
   then adopted in finite element analyses, with the interfacial properties
   determined directly from the experiments. With the mode-I fracture
   toughness from a previous study, the model was used to predict
   mixed-mode fracture of the silicon/epoxy interfaces for phase angles
   ranging from to . Results from experiments using ELS specimens with
   phase angles that differed from those employed in parameter extraction
   were used to validate the model. Additional measurements would be
   necessary to further extend the reach of the model to mode-II dominant
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Given a symmetric nonnegative matrix A, symmetric nonnegative matrix
   factorization (symNMF) is the problem of finding a nonnegative matrix H,
   usually with much fewer columns than A, such that A approximate to HHT.
   SymNMF can be used for data analysis and in particular for various
   clustering tasks. Unlike standard NMF, which is traditionally solved by
   a series of quadratic (convex) subproblems, we propose to solve symNMF
   by directly solving the nonconvex problem, namely, minimize parallel to
   A - HHT parallel to(2), which is a fourth-order nonconvex problem. In
   this paper, we propose simple and very efficient coordinate descent
   schemes, which solve a series of fourth-order univariate subproblems
   exactly. We also derive convergence guarantees for our methods and show
   that they perform favorably compared to recent state-of-the-art methods
   on synthetic and real-world datasets, especially on large and sparse
   input matrices.}},

Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{653}},
Pages = {{66-70}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Weak chemisorption of ethylene has been shown to be an important
   characteristic in the use of metals for the separation of ethylene from
   ethane. Previously, density functional theory (DFT) has been used to
   predict the binding energies of various metals and alloys, with Ag
   having the lowest chemisorption energy amongst the metals and alloys
   studied. Here Au/Cu alloys are investigated by a combination of DFT
   calculations and experimental measurements. It is inferred from
   experiments that the binding energy between a Au/Cu alloy and ethylene
   is lower than to either of the pure metals, and DFT calculations confirm
   that this is the case when Au segregates to the particle surface.
   Implications of this work suggest that it may be possible to further
   tune the binding energy with ethylene by compositional and morphological
   control of films produced from Au-surface segregated alloys. (C) 2016

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{64-77}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a novel technique, POF-Darts, to estimate the Probability
   Of Failure based on random disk packing in the uncertain parameter
   space. POF-Darts uses hyperplane sampling to explore the unexplored part
   of the uncertain space. We use the function evaluation at a sample point
   to determine whether it belongs to failure or non-failure regions, and
   surround it with a protection sphere region to avoid clustering. We
   decompose the domain into Voronoi cells around the function evaluations
   as seeds and choose the radius of the protection sphere depending on the
   local Lipschitz continuity. As sampling proceeds, regions uncovered with
   spheres will shrink, improving the estimation accuracy. After exhausting
   the function evaluation budget, we build a surrogate model using the
   function evaluations associated with the sample points and estimate the
   probability of failure by exhaustive sampling of that surrogate. In
   comparison to other similar methods, our algorithm has the advantages of
   decoupling the sampling step from the surrogate construction one, the
   ability to reach target POF values with fewer samples, and the
   capability of estimating the number and locations of disconnected
   failure regions, not just the POF value. We present various examples to
   demonstrate the efficiency of our novel approach. Published by Elsevier

   promoted the phase transformation towards cordierite, meanwhile, due to
   the enhancement of necks at the contacting pionts growth by the
   additions of diatomite (5.17 wt\%), a high three-point flexural strength
   of 49.19 MPa was achieved at an open porosity of 37.72\% sintered at

Abstract = {{In the past 15 years drug delivery devices have received added
   attention, not only as passive systems of drug delivery that respond to
   the needs of the health care provider or the patient but have an added
   advantage or an added characteristic of being triggered by an external
   process of recognition of a cause, a disease or an analyte that leads to
   a triggering mechanism for specific drug delivery. In this review, we
   will examine some of the pioneering work in this field, and speak on the
   use of biodegradable, environmentally-responsive hydrogels as sensing
   components in novel microscale devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Electrolyte and electrode materials used in lithium-ion batteries have
   been studied separately to a great extent, however the structural and
   dynamical properties of the electrolyte-electrode interface still remain
   largely unexplored despite its critical role in governing battery
   performance. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the
   structural reorganization of solvent molecules (cyclic ethylene
   carbonate : linear dimethyl carbonate 1 : 1 molar ratio doped with 1 M
   LiPF6) in the vicinity of graphite electrodes with varying surface
   charge densities (sigma). The interfacial structure is found to be
   sensitive to the molecular geometry and polarity of each solvent
   molecule as well as the surface structure and charge distribution of the
   negative electrode. We also evaluated the potential difference across
   the electrolyte-electrode interface, which exhibits a nearly linear
   variation with respect to s up until the onset of Li+ ion accumulation
   onto the graphite edges from the electrolyte. In addition, well-tempered
   metadynamics simulations are employed to predict the free-energy
   barriers to Li+ ion transport through the relatively dense interfacial
   layer, along with analysis of the Li+ solvation sheath structure.
   Quantitative analysis of the molecular arrangements at the
   electrolyte-electrode interface will help better understand and describe
   electrolyte decomposition, especially in the early stages of
   solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) formation. Moreover, the
   computational framework presented in this work offers a means to explore
   the effects of solvent composition, electrode surface modification, and
   operating temperature on the interfacial structure and properties, which
   may further assist in efforts to engineer the electrolyte-electrode
   interface leading to a SEI layer that optimizes battery performance.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the influence of monsoonal climate and transport of
   atmospheric mercury (Hg) in southwestern China, measurements of total
   gaseous mercury (TGM, defined as the sum of gaseous elemental mercury,
   GEM, and gaseous oxidized mercury, GOM), particulate bound mercury (PBM)
   and GOM were carried out at Ailaoshan Station (ALS, 2450ma.s.l.) in
   southwestern China from May 2011 to May 2012. The mean concentrations
   (+/- SD) for TGM, GOM and PBM were 2.09 +/- 0.63, 2.2 +/- 2.3 and 31.3
   +/- 28.4 pg m(-3), respectively. TGM showed a monsoonal distribution
   pattern with relatively higher concentrations (2.22 +/- 0.58 ngm(-3), p
   = 0.021) during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM, from May to September)
   and the east Asia summer monsoon (EASM, from May to September) periods
   than that (1.99 +/- 0.66 ng m(-3)) in the non-ISM period. Similarly, GOM
   and PBM concentrations were higher during the ISM period than during the
   non-ISM period. This study suggests that the ISM and the EASM have a
   strong impact on longrange and transboundary transport of Hg between
   southwestern China and south and southeast Asia. Several high TGM events
   were accompanied by the occurrence of northern wind during the ISM
   period, indicating anthropogenic Hg emissions from inland China could
   rapidly increase TGM levels at ALS due to strengthening of the EASM.
   Most of the TGM and PBM events occurred at ALS during the non-ISM
   period. Meanwhile, high CO concentrations were also observed at ALS,
   indicating that a strong south tributary of westerlies could have
   transported Hg from south and southeast Asia to southwestern China
   during the non-ISM period. The biomass burning in southeast Asia and
   anthropogenic Hg emissions from south Asia are thought to be the source
   of atmospheric Hg in remote areas of southwestern China during the
   nonISM period.}},

Abstract = {{Lens design for focusing and imaging has been optimized through
   centuries of developments; however, conventional lenses, even in their
   most ideal realizations, still suffer from fundamental limitations, such
   as limits in resolution and the presence of optical aberrations, which
   are inherent to the laws of refraction. In addition, volume-to-volume
   imaging of three-dimensional regions of space is not possible with
   systems based on conventional refractive optics, which are inherently
   limited to plane-to-plane imaging. Although some of these limitations
   have been at least theoretically relaxed with the advent of
   metamaterials, several challenges still stand in the way of ideal
   imaging of three-dimensional regions of space. Here, we show that the
   concept of parity-time symmetry, combined with tailored nonlocal
   responses, enables overcoming some of these challenges, and we propose
   the design of a loss-immune, linear, transversely invariant, planarized
   metamaterial lens, with reduced aberrations and the potential to realize
   volume-to-volume imaging.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{The scale dependence of the statistical alignment tendencies of the
   eigenvectors of the strain-rate tensor e(i), with the vorticity vector
   omega, is examined in the self-preserving region of a planar turbulent
   mixing layer. Data from a direct numerical simulation are filtered at
   various length scales and the probability density functions of the
   magnitude of the alignment cosines between the two unit vectors vertical
   bar e(i) . (omega) over cap vertical bar are examined. It is observed
   that the alignment tendencies are insensitive to the concurrent
   large-scale velocity fluctuations, but are quantitatively affected by
   the nature of the concurrent large-scale velocity-gradient fluctuations.
   It is confirmed that the small-scale (local) vorticity vector is
   preferentially aligned in parallel with the large-scale (background)
   extensive strain-rate eigenvector e(1), in contrast to the global
   tendency for omega to be aligned in parallelwith the intermediate
   strain-rate eigenvector {[}Hamlington et al., Phys. Fluids 20, 111703
   (2008)]. When only data from regions of the flow that exhibit strong
   swirling are included, the so-called high-enstrophy worms, the alignment
   tendencies are exaggerated with respect to the global picture. These
   findings support the notion that the production of enstrophy,
   responsible for a net cascade of turbulent kinetic energy from large
   scales to small scales, is driven by vorticity stretching due to the
   preferential parallel alignment between omega and nonlocal e(1) and that
   the strongly swirling worms are kinematically significant to this
   process.}},

Title = {{Anomalous bulk modulus in vanadate spinels}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{All single-valent oxide spinels are insulators. The relatively small
   activation energy in the temperature dependence of resistivity in
   vanadate spinels led to the speculation that the spinels are near the
   crossover from localized to itinerant electronic behavior, and the
   crossover could be achieved under pressure. We have performed a number
   of experiments and calculations aimed at obtaining information regarding
   structural changes under high pressure for the whole series of vanadate
   spinels, as well as transport and magnetic properties under pressure for
   MgV2O4. We have also studied the crystal structure under pressure of
   wide-gap insulators ACr(2)O(4) (A = Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) for comparison.
   Moreover, the relationship between the bulk modulus and the cell volume
   of AV(2)O(4) (A = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) has been simulated by a density
   functional theory calculation. The proximity of AV(2)O(4) spinels to the
   electronic state crossover under high pressure has been tested by three
   criteria: (1) a predicted critical V-V bond length, (2) the observation
   of a sign change in the pressure dependence of Neel temperature, and (3)
   measurement of a reduced bulk modulus. The obtained results indicate
   that, although the crossover from localized to itinerant pi bonding V-3d
   electrons in the AV(2)O(4) spinels is approached by reducing under
   pressure the V-V separation R, the critical separation Rc is not reached
   by 20 GPa in CoV2O4, which has the smallest V-V separation in the
   AV(2)O(4) (A = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) spinels.}},

Abstract = {{Amine scrubbing is a necessary technology to offset CO2 emissions from
   fossil-fuel power plants. Of the many solvents studied, hindered amines
   are of particular interest for their marriage of the capacity of
   tertiary amines with rates a hundredfold greater than tertiary amines.
   The relatively rapid rates of hindered amines have not been adequately
   explained, despite their extensive use in commercial solvents. This work
   seeks to explain the rapid rate of mass transfer of 2-piperidineethanol
   (2PE) and uses this rationale to draw general conclusions on hindered
   amines.
   Quantitative C-13 NMR data were collected to determine the equilibrium
   of carbamate in 30 wt\% 2PE. Using these data along with VLE and pK(a)
   data, a rigorous thermodynamic model of 8 molal 2PE was built with
   electrolyte-NRTL and activity-based kinetics. Wetted-wall column flux
   data were fit to create the activity-based mass transfer model. Using
   this comprehensive model, the mass transfer rate was examined through
   sensitivity studies and Bronsted correlations.
   This work shows that 2PE forms a more stable carbamate than
   2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. The carbamate reaction is the most
   significant component of mass transfer at 40 degrees C. The Bronsted
   correlation for carbamate reactions of unhindered amines predicts the
   rate of carbamate reaction of 2PE, but the Bronsted correlation for
   bicarbonate underpredicts the regressed rate. The CO2 solubility is fit
   with five parameters with an ARD of 0.84\%. The kinetics are fit with a
   carbamate- and a bicarbonate-forming reaction with an ARD of 7.03\%.
   The chief conclusions are (1) that the rapid mass transfer of hindered
   amines is due to the formation of carbamate and the high pKa of the
   amine, (2) the carbamate formation rate appears unimpeded by steric
   hindrance and is predicted by a Bronsted correlation, suggesting that
   hindered amines react in the same manner as unhindered amines. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Intriguing lattice dynamics have been predicted for aperiodic crystals
   that contain incommensurate substructures. Here we report inelastic
   neutron scattering measurements of phonon and magnon dispersions in
   Sr14Cu24O41, which contains incommensurate one-dimensional (1D) chain
   and two-dimensional (2D) ladder substructures. Two distinct
   pseudoacoustic phonon modes, corresponding to the sliding motion of one
   sublattice against the other, are observed for atomic motions polarized
   along the incommensurate axis. In the long wavelength limit, it is found
   that the sliding mode shows a remarkably small energy gap of 1.7-1.9
   meV, indicating very weak interactions between the two incommensurate
   sublattices. The measurements also reveal a gapped and steep linear
   magnon dispersion of the ladder sublattice. The high group velocity of
   this magnon branch and weak coupling with acoustic and pseudoacoustic
   phonons can explain the large magnon thermal conductivity in Sr14Cu24O41
   crystals. In addition, the magnon specific heat is determined from the
   measured total specific heat and phonon density of states and exhibits a
   Schottky anomaly due to gapped magnon modes of the spin chains. These
   findings offer new insights into the phonon and magnon dynamics and
   thermal transport properties of incommensurate magnetic crystals that
   contain low-dimensional substructures.}},

Abstract = {{Whether CaCrO3 is a Mott insulator or a correlated metal is still
   controversial. We have performed measurements of magnetization, specific
   heat, and thermal conductivity on CaCrO3 samples selected from many
   batches of high-pressure synthesis. The single-crystal CaCrO3 sample
   exhibits an unprecedentedly sharp transition at a Neel temperature T-N
   approximate to 90 K. The critical behavior of specific heat cannot be
   rationalized by the renormalization group theory for a second-order
   magnetic transition. More surprisingly, the thermal conductivity kappa
   exhibits an anomalous drop on cooling through T-N, which is opposite to
   all known influence on kappa from either spin or orbital ordering. We
   have argued, on the basis of anomalies found in all three measurements
   and structural data, for the coexistence of itinerant pi-bonding
   electrons in a c-axis band and localized xy electrons in xy orbitals
   responsible for type-C antiferromagnetic order below T-N and the
   occupation of a pure, localized xy orbital undergoing a Bose-Einstein
   condensate at T-N}},

Title = {{Slater Insulator in Iridate Perovskites with Strong Spin-Orbit Coupling}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{The perovskite SrIrO3 is an exotic narrow-band metal owing to a
   confluence of the strengths of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the
   electron-electron correlations. It has been proposed that topological
   and magnetic insulating phases can be achieved by tuning the SOC,
   Hubbard interactions, and/or lattice symmetry. Here, we report that the
   substitution of nonmagnetic, isovalent Sn4+ for Ir4+ in the SrIr1-xSnxO3
   perovskites synthesized under high pressure leads to a metal-insulator
   transition to an anti-ferromagnetic (AF) phase at T-N >= 225 K. The
   continuous change of the cell volume as detected by x-ray diffraction
   and the lambda-shape transition of the specific heat on cooling through
   T-N demonstrate that the metal-insulator transition is of second order.
   Neutron powder diffraction results indicate that the Sn substitution
   enlarges an octahedral-site distortion that reduces the SOC relative to
   the spin-spin exchange interaction and results in the type-G AF spin
   ordering below T-N. Measurement of high-temperature magnetic
   susceptibility shows the evolution of magnetic coupling in the
   paramagnetic phase typical of weak itinerant-electron magnetism in the
   Sn-substituted samples. A reduced structural symmetry in the
   magnetically ordered phase leads to an electron gap opening at the
   Brillouin zone boundary below T-N in the same way as proposed by Slater.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an electrolyte additive can
   considerably improve the cycling performance of silicon (Si) electrodes
   in Li-ion batteries. However, the fundamental mechanism for how FEC
   contributes to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) morphological changes
   and chemical composition is not well understood. Here, scanning
   transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss
   spectroscopy gives a comprehensive insight as to how FEC affects the SEI
   evolution in terms of composition and morphology throughout
   electrochemical cycling. In the fi rst lithiation cycle, the electrode
   cycled in ethylene carbonate (EC): diethylene carbonate (DEC) forms a
   porous uneven SEI composed of mostly Li2CO3. However, the electrode
   cycled in EC/DEC/FEC is covered in a dense and uniform SEI containing
   mostly LiF. Interestingly, the intrinsic oxide layer (LixSiO gamma) is
   not observed at the interface of electrode cycled in EC/DEC/FEC after 1
   cycle. This is consistent with fl uoride anion formation from the
   reduction of FEC, which leads to the chemical attack of any
   silicon-oxide surface passivation layer. Furthermore, surface sensitive
   helium ion microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques
   give further insights to the SEI composition and morphology in both
   electrodes cycled with different electrolytes.}},

Abstract = {{The simple fabrication of composites of germanium nanoparticles
   dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (Ge/NC) of varying
   nitrogen content and their performance in lithium ion battery anodes are
   reported. A heavily nitrogen-doped carbon gel was formed by condensing
   m-phenylenediamine with formaldehyde (PF-gel); a less heavily N-doped
   gel was formed by condensing resorcinol and m-phenylenediamine with
   formaldehyde (RPF-gel); and an undoped gel was formed by condensing
   resorcinol with formaldehyde (RF-gel). Pyrolises of the gels with GeCl4
   at 750 degrees C produced nanocrystalline Ge composites with 7.5 atom \%
   N-doped carbon, termed Ge/NC (PF), with 3.9\% N-doped carbon, termed
   Ge/NC (RPF) and undoped carbon, termed Ge/C (RF). The heavily N-doped
   Ge/NC (PF) anode retained a reversible capacity of 684 mAhg(-1) at a
   specific current of 0.2 Ag-1 after 200 cycles, versus 337 mAhg(-1)
   retained by anode made with Ge/NC (RPF) and 278 mAhg(-1) retained by
   anode made with undoped Ge/C (RF). At a specific current 2.0 Ag-1, the
   capacity of the Ge/NC (PF) anode was 472 mAhg(-1), versus the 210
   mAhg(-1) of the Ge/NC (RPF) anode and 83 mAhg(-1) of the Ge/C (RF)
   anode. The enhanced performance of the Ge/NC (PF) anode is attributed to
   the better electrical conductivity of Ge/NC (PF) and to the higher
   density of Li+ binding defects in its N-doped carbon.}},

Title = {{In vivo continuous evolution of genes and pathways in yeast}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Directed evolution remains a powerful, highly generalizable approach for
   improving the performance of biological systems. However,
   implementations in eukaryotes rely either on in vitro diversity
   generation or limited mutational capacities. Here we synthetically
   optimize the retrotransposon Ty1 to enable in vivo generation of mutant
   libraries up to 1.6 x 10(7) l(-1) per round, which is the highest of any
   in vivo mutational generation approach in yeast. We demonstrate this
   approach by using in vivo-generated libraries to evolve single enzymes,
   global transcriptional regulators and multi-gene pathways. When coupled
   to growth selection, this approach enables in vivo continuous evolution
   (ICE) of genes and pathways. Through a head-to-head comparison, we find
   that ICE libraries yield higher-performing variants faster than
   error-prone PCR-derived libraries. Finally, we demonstrate
   transferability of ICE to divergent yeasts, including Kluyveromyces
   lactis and alternative S. cerevisiae strains. Collectively, this work
   establishes a generic platform for rapid eukaryotic-directed evolution
   across an array of target cargo.}},

Title = {{Thermal energy storage to minimize cost and improve efficiency of a
   polygeneration district energy system in a real-time electricity market}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{113}},

Abstract = {{District energy systems can produce low-cost utilities for large energy
   networks, but can also be a resource for the electric grid by their
   ability to ramp production or to store thermal energy by responding to
   real-time market signals. In this work, dynamic optimization exploits
   the flexibility of thermal energy storage by determining optimal times
   to store and extract excess energy. This concept is applied to a
   polygeneration distributed energy system with combined heat and power,
   district heating, district cooling, and chilled water thermal energy
   storage. The system is a university campus responsible for meeting the
   energy needs of tens of thousands of people. The objective for the
   dynamic optimization problem is to minimize cost over a 24-h period
   while meeting multiple loads in real time. The paper presents a novel
   algorithm to solve this dynamic optimization problem with energy storage
   by decomposing the problem into multiple static mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming (MINLP) problems. Another innovative feature of this work is
   the study of a large, complex energy network which includes the
   interrelations of a wide variety of energy technologies. Results
   indicate that a cost savings of 16.5\% is realized when the system can
   participate in the wholesale electricity market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) methods have
   become widely adopted in estimating protein-ligand binding affinities
   due to their efficiency and high correlation with experiment. Here
   different computational alternatives were investigated to assess their
   impact to the agreement of MMPBSA calculations with experiment. Seven
   receptor families with both high-quality crystal structures and binding
   affinities were selected. First the performance of nonpolar solvation
   models was studied and it was found that the modern approach that
   separately models hydrophobic and dispersion interactions dramatically
   reduces RMSD's of computed relative binding affinities. The numerical
   setup of the Poisson-Boltzmann methods was analyzed next. The data shows
   that the impact of grid spacing to the quality of MMPBSA calculations is
   small: the numerical error at the grid spacing of 0.5 angstrom is
   already small enough to be negligible. The impact of different atomic
   radius sets and different molecular surface definitions was further
   analyzed and weak influences were found on the agreement with
   experiment. The influence of solute dielectric constant was also
   analyzed: a higher dielectric constant generally improves the overall
   agreement with experiment, especially for highly charged binding
   pockets. The data also showed that the converged simulations caused
   slight reduction in the agreement with experiment. Finally the direction
   of estimating absolute binding free energies was briefly explored. Upon
   correction of the binding-induced rearrangement free energy and the
   binding entropy lost, the errors in absolute binding affinities were
   also reduced dramatically when the modern nonpolar solvent model was
   used, although further developments were apparently necessary to further
   improve the MMPBSA methods. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an alternative formulation of the incremental
   variational procedure (IVP) of Lahellec and Suquet (2013) to estimate
   the macroscopic response and field statistics in elasto-viscoplastic
   composites. The basic idea is to make use of a time-incremental
   variational formulation for the strain-rate potential of the
   elasto-viscoplastic composite, to define a homogenization problem for a
   viscoplastic composite with non-uniform ``eigenstrain rates{''} in the
   phases. Both the nonlinearity and the heterogeneity of the properties in
   the phases can then be handled by means of the variational procedure of
   Ponte Castaneda (1992) in terms of a suitably optimized linear
   comparison composite with uniform properties, for which standard
   homogenization estimates are available. The IVP is then applied to
   two-phase composites consisting of aligned, ellipsoidal elastic
   particles in an elastic-ideally plastic matrix and the effects of the
   particle concentration and shape, as well as the properties of the
   matrix and particles, are investigated. Upon uniform strain-rate
   loading, three regimes of deformation are observed: a linear, purely
   elastic regime, followed by a transient elasto-plastic regime, and then
   a steady-state ideally plastic regime. It is found that the more
   compliant the matrix and inclusion phases of the composite are, the
   stronger the long-term memory effects are, especially when the
   inclusions are more compliant than the matrix. Similarly, the duration
   of the transient regime is significantly extended for sufficiently
   elongated, or flattened particle shapes, but only under certain modes of
   deformation. Finally, consistent with earlier work, significant
   Bauschinger effects are observed for cyclic loading conditions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Adding large solar photovoltaic (PV) resources into an electric grid
   influences the flexibility characteristics of its net load profile. The
   dispatch of the existing generation fleet changes as it adjusts to
   accommodate the new net load. This study categorizes and defines these
   flexibility characteristics. It utilizes a unit commitment and dispatch
   (UC\&D) model to simulate large solar generation assets with different
   geographic locations and orientations. The simulations show the
   sensitivity of the wholesale energy price, reserve market prices, total
   dispatch cost, fuel mix, emissions, and water use to changes in net load
   flexibility requirements. The results show that generating 22,500 GW h
   of solar energy in a 2011 simulation of the Electric Reliability Council
   of Texas (ERCOT) reduces total dispatch cost by approximately \$900
   million (a 103\% decrease) while increasing ancillary services costs by
   approximately \$10 million (a 3\% increase). The results also show that
   PV reduces water consumption and water withdrawals as well as CO2, NOx,
   and SOx emissions. It also reduces peak load by 4\% but increases net
   load volatility by 40-79\% and ramping by 11-33\%. In addition,
   west-located, west-oriented solar resources reduce total dispatch cost
   more than the other simulated solar scenarios. The west-located,
   west-oriented solar simulation required greater system flexibility, but
   utilized more low-cost generators and fewer high-cost generators for
   energy production than other simulated scenarios. These results suggest
   that the mix of energy provided by different generation technologies
   influences the dispatch cost more than the net load flexibility
   requirements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{568}},

Abstract = {{Metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) are considered to have the potency to
   generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), one of the key mechanisms
   underlying nanotoxicity. However, the nanotoxicology literature
   demonstrates a lack of consensus on the dominant toxicity mechanism(s)
   for a particular MONP. Moreover, recent literature has studied the
   correlation between band structure of pristine MONPs to their ability to
   introduce ROS and thus has downplayed the ROS-mediated toxicological
   relevance of a number of such materials. On the other hand, material
   science can control the band structure of these materials to engineer
   their electronic and optical properties and thereby is constantly
   modulating the pristine electronic structure. Since band structure is
   the fundamental material property that controls ROS-producing ability,
   band tuning via introduction of dopants and defects needs careful
   consideration in toxicity assessments. This commentary critically
   evaluates the existing material science and nanotoxicity literature and
   identifies the gap in our understanding of the role of important crystal
   structure features (i.e., dopants and defects) on MONPs' electronic
   structure alteration as well as their ROS-generation capability.
   Furthermore, this commentary provides suggestions on characterization
   techniques to evaluate dopants and defects on the crystal structure and
   identifies research needs for advanced theoretical predictions of their
   electronic band structures and ROS-generation abilities. Correlation of
   electronic band structure and ROS will not only aid in better
   mechanistic assessment of nanotoxicity but will be impactful in
   designing and developing ROS-based applications ranging from water
   disinfection to next-generation antibiotics and even cancer
   therapeutics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reliable characterization of bitumen based on perturbation from

Abstract = {{Bitumen recovery by steam-solvent coinjection involves the coupled
   thermal/compositional mechanisms for reduction of bitumen viscosity.
   Reliable design of such processes requires reservoir flow simulation
   based on a proper phase-behavior model so that the oleic-phase viscosity
   near the steam-chamber edge can be modeled reliably. However, the effect
   of bitumen ``characterization (e.g., the number of pseudo components
   used) on steam-solvent coinjection simulation has not been studied in
   detail, and can be realized only after running multiple reservoir
   simulations, which is time consuming.
   There are two main objectives in this paper. One is to develop a
   reliable method for bitumen characterization by improving the fluid
   characterization method that was recently developed based on
   perturbation from n-alkanes (PnA). The other is to develop a novel
   analytical method for assessing the sensitivity of a particular
   coinjection simulation to bitumen characterization without having to
   perform reservoir simulations. A simulation case study is given to
   validate this analytical method.
   A proper number of pseudo components for bitumen characterization cannot
   be determined without considering the effect of phase behavior on the
   oleic-phase viscosity at chamber-edge conditions in steam-solvent
   coinjection simulation. Results show that the analytical method
   developed in this research can detect the sensitivity of recovery
   simulation to bitumen characterization without performing multiple flow
   simulations using different sets of fluid models. The PnA-based method
   developed for bitumen characterization gives reliable predictions of
   phase behavior for bitumen/solvent mixtures with a small amount of
   experimental data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{About 70\% of pharmaceutical drug candidates are poorly soluble and
   suffer from low oral bioavailability. Additionally, a large number of
   therapeutics are also substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) receptors
   present on the intestinal cell lining and undergo efflux that further
   reduces their oral bioavailability drastically. Nanoscale hydrogels are
   promising candidates for oral delivery of hydrophobic therapeutics as
   they hold immense potential in improving solubility and increasing
   intestinal permeability of such therapeutics. In this report, we
   describe the in vitro evaluation and comparison of four novel,
   pH-responsive poly(methacrylic acid-g-polyethylene glycol-co-hydrophobic
   monomer) nanoscale hydrogels for their capacity to load and release
   chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, as well as their ability to modulate
   permeability in vitro for improving doxorubicin transport. The resulting
   nanoscale formulations showed appreciable loading, and in vitro release
   studies demonstrated excellent pH-triggered release kinetics. These
   nanoscale hydrogels can serve as carriers for oral delivery of
   doxorubicin, achieving drug loading efficiencies of 56-70\%, and
   releasing up to 95\% of drug within 6 h. Powder X-ray diffraction
   studies revealed a change from the crystalline nature of doxorubicin to
   an amorphous form when encapsulated within formulations, illustrating
   their potential of enhancing solubility and stability for oral delivery
   of the hydrophobic therapeutic. Furthermore, their ability to modulate
   in vitro intestinal permeability was also studied using transport
   studies with Caco-2 cells, and was complemented by assessing their
   antitumor activity against P-gp overexpressing, DOX-resistant H69/LX4
   cancer cells. In vitro cell culture tests demonstrated up to 50\%
   reduction in cellular proliferation in the case of poly(methacrylic
   acid-g-polyethylene glycol-co-methyl methacrylate), suggesting that
   these carriers are most suitable as hydrophobic drug carriers that can
   potentially overcome solubility and permeability limitations typically
   faced by hydrophobic therapeutics in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.}},

Abstract = {{There are few studies of the impact of membrane charge on ion and
   organic uncharged solute transport in polymers. This study was aimed at
   addressing the lack of such fundamental information in the literature.
   Liquid methanol sorption, diffusion and permeation in water swollen,
   cross-linked, uncharged poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (XLPEGDA) and
   in charged membranes were investigated. Membrane water content
   significantly influences methanol solubility, diffusivity and
   permeability, with more swollen membranes having faster methanol
   transport rates. The Mackie-Meares model was used to interpret and
   correlate diffusion data. The Flory-Rehner theory for ternary systems
   was used to interpret methanol sorption isotherms in XLPEGDA-based
   polymers. Methanol and sodium chloride transport patterns are similar in
   neutral hydrogels, while substantial differences are observed in ion
   exchange polymers. These differences are ascribed to sodium chloride
   transport in charged polymers being strongly influenced by Donnan
   exclusion, while methanol sorption and diffusion are not. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The static adsorption of C12-14E22, which is a highly ethoxylated
   nonionic surfactant, was studied on different minerals using
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with an
   evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). Of particular interest is
   the surfactant adsorption in the presence of CO2 because it can be used
   for foam flooding in enhanced oil recovery applications. The effects of
   the mineral type, impurities, salinity, and temperature were
   investigated. The adsorption of C12-14E22 on pure calcite was as low as
   0.01 mg/m(2) but higher on dolomite depending on the silica and clay
   content in the mineral. The adsorption remained unchanged when the
   experiments were performed using a brine solution or 0.101 MPa (1 atm)
   CO2, which indicates that electrostatic force is not the governing
   factor that drives the adsorption. The adsorption of C12-14E22 on silica
   may be due to hydrogen bonding between the oxygen in the ethoxy groups
   of the surfactant and the hydroxyl groups on the mineral surface.
   Additionally, thermal decomposition of the surfactant was severe at 80
   degrees C but can be inhibited by operating in a reducing environment.
   Under reducing conditions, adsorption of C12-14E22 increased at higher
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Next generation drug screening could benefit greatly from in vivo
   studies, using small animal models such as Caenorhabditis elegans for
   hit identification and lead optimization. Current in vivo assays can
   operate either at low throughput with high resolution or with low
   resolution at high throughput. To enable both high-throughput and
   high-resolution imaging of C. elegans, we developed an automated
   microfluidic platform. This platform can image 15 z-stacks of similar to
   4,000 C. elegans from 96 different populations using a large-scale chip
   with a micron resolution in 16 min. Using this platform, we screened
   similar to 100,000 animals of the polyglutamine aggregation model on 25
   chips. We tested the efficacy of similar to 1,000 FDA-approved drugs in
   improving the aggregation phenotype of the model and identified four
   confirmed hits. This robust platform now enables high-content screening
   of various C. elegans disease models at the speed and cost of in vitro
   cell-based assays.}},

Title = {{Gate-tunable and thickness-dependent electronic and thermoelectric

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in layered
   transition metal dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2).
   Most studies so far have focused on the electronic and optoelectronic
   properties of single-layer MoS2, whose band structure features a direct
   bandgap, in sharp contrast to the indirect bandgap of thicker MoS2. In
   this paper, we present a systematic study of the thickness-dependent
   electrical and thermoelectric properties of few-layer MoS2. We observe
   that the electrical conductivity (sigma) increases as we reduce the
   thickness of MoS2 and peaks at about two layers, with six-times larger
   conductivity than our thickest sample (23-layer MoS2). Using a back-gate
   voltage, we modulate the Fermi energy (E-F) of the sample where an
   increase in the Seebeck coefficient (S) is observed with decreasing gate
   voltage (E-F) towards the subthreshold (OFF state) of the device,
   reaching as large as 500 mu V/K in a four-layer MoS2. While previous
   reports have focused on a single-layer MoS2 and measured Seebeck
   coefficient in the OFF state, which has vanishing electrical
   conductivity and thermoelectric power factor (PF = S-2 sigma), we show
   that MoS2-based devices in their ON state can have PF as large as >50 mu
   W/cm K-2 in the two-layer sample. The PF increases with decreasing
   thickness and then drops abruptly from double-layer to single-layer
   MoS2, a feature we suggest as due to a change in the energy dependence
   of the electron mean-free-path according to our theoretical calculation.
   Moreover, we show that care must be taken in thermoelectric measurements
   in the OFF state to avoid obtaining erroneously large Seebeck
   coefficients when the channel resistance is very high. Our study paves
   the way towards a more comprehensive examination of the thermoelectric
   performance of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors. Published by AIP
   Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Van der Waal's heterostructures allow for novel devices such as
   two-dimensional-to-two-dimensional tunnel devices, exemplified by
   interlayer tunnel FETs. These devices employ
   channel/tunnel-barrier/channel geometries. However, during
   layer-by-layer exfoliation of these multi-layer materials, rotational
   misalignment is the norm and may substantially affect device
   characteristics. In this work, by using density functional theory
   methods, we consider a reduction in tunneling due to weakened coupling
   across the rotationally misaligned interface between the channel layers
   and the tunnel barrier. As a prototypical system, we simulate the
   effects of rotational misalignment of the tunnel barrier layer between
   aligned channel layers in a graphene/hBN/graphene system. We find that
   the rotational misalignment between the channel layers and the tunnel
   barrier in this van der Waal's heterostructure can significantly reduce
   coupling between the channels by reducing, specifically, coupling across
   the interface between the channels and the tunnel barrier. This weakened
   coupling in graphene/hBN/graphene with hBN misalignment may be relevant
   to all such van der Waal's heterostructures. Published by AIP
   Publishing.}},

Title = {{Nanoscale probing of electron-regulated structural transitions in silk
   proteins by near-field IR imaging and nano-spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Silk protein fibres produced by silkworms and spiders are renowned for
   their unparalleled mechanical strength and extensibility arising from
   their high-beta-sheet crystal contents as natural materials.
   Investigation of beta-sheet-oriented conformational transitions in silk
   proteins at the nanoscale remains a challenge using conventional imaging
   techniques given their limitations in chemical sensitivity or limited
   spatial resolution. Here, we report on electron-regulated nanoscale
   polymorphic transitions in silk proteins revealed by near-field infrared
   imaging and nano-spectroscopy at resolutions approaching the molecular
   level. The ability to locally probe nanoscale protein structural
   transitions combined with nanometre-precision electron-beam lithography
   offers us the capability to finely control the structure of silk
   proteins in two and three dimensions. Our work paves the way for
   unlocking essential nanoscopic protein structures and critical
   conditions for electron-induced conformational transitions, offering new
   rules to design protein-based nanoarchitectures.}},

Title = {{Thermopile detector of light ellipticity}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Polarimetric imaging is widely used in applications from material
   analysis to biomedical diagnostics, vision and astronomy. The degree of
   circular polarization, or light ellipticity, is associated with the S-3
   Stokes parameter which is defined as the difference in the intensities
   of the left- and right-circularly polarized components of light.
   Traditional way of determining this parameter relies on using several
   external optical elements, such as polarizers and wave plates, along
   with conventional photodetectors, and performing at least two
   measurements to distinguish left- and right-circularly polarized light
   components. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate
   a thermopile photodetector element that provides bipolar voltage output
   directly proportional to the S-3 Stokes parameter of the incident light.}},

Abstract = {{The first-order plus time delay (FOPTD) model-based method is a standard
   approach to tune proportional integral (PI) controllers in plants. The
   FOPTD model can be obtained easily from step responses. However, because
   of their structural limitations, FOPTD models suffer from difficulties
   in approximating step responses for some processes including processes
   with overshoot, resulting in PI controllers with unacceptable
   performance. To remove these drawbacks, models combining two FOPTD
   models that can be obtained easily from step responses are proposed to
   tune PI controllers. Several simulations and experimental examples are
   given, illustrating the improved performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of biomolecules, drugs, and other reagents across the cell's
   plasma membrane barrier is an inefficient and poorly controlled process,
   despite its fundamental importance to biotechnology, cell biology, and
   pharmaceutics. In particular, insufficient membrane permeability
   frequently limits the accumulation of drugs and reagents in the
   cytoplasm, undermining their efficacy. While encapsulating drugs in
   particles increases uptake by cells, inefficient release of drugs from
   these particles into the cytoplasm ultimately limits drug efficacy. In
   contrast, gap junctions provide a direct route to the cytoplasm that
   bypasses the plasma membrane. As transmembrane channels that physically
   connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, gap junctions permit transport
   of a diverse range of molecules, from ions and metabolites to siRNA,
   peptides, and chemotherapeutics. To utilize gap junctions for molecular
   delivery we have developed Connectosomes, cell-derived lipid vesicles
   that contain functional gap junction channels and encapsulate molecular
   cargos. Here we show that these vesicles form gap junction channels with
   cells, opening a direct and efficient route for the delivery of
   molecular cargo to the cellular cytoplasm. Specifically, we demonstrate
   that using gap junctions to deliver the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin
   reduces the therapeutically effective dose of the drug by more than an
   order of magnitude. Delivering drugs through gap junctions has the
   potential to boost the effectiveness of existing drugs such as
   chemotherapeutics, while simultaneously enabling the delivery of
   membrane-impermeable drugs and reagents.}},

Abstract = {{We perform computational studies of nanosecond streamer discharges

   streamer discharge are different at low and high positive trigger
   voltages with the axial streamer evolution dominant for low voltages and
   a surface hugging mode favored for high voltages. We also find a
   substantial difference in initiation, transition and evolution stages of
   discharge for positive and negative trigger voltages with the volumetric
   distribution of species in the streamer channel much more uniform for
   negative trigger voltages on account of the presence of multiple
   streamers. We observe that the presence of water vapor does not affect
   the breakdown voltage even for oversaturated conditions but
   significantly influences the composition of dominant species in the

Abstract = {{With a notable advantage in terms of capacity, molybdenum disulfide has
   been considered a promising anode material for building
   high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. However, its intrinsically
   low electronic conductivity and unstable electrochemistry lead to poor
   cycling stability and inferior rate performance. We herein describe the
   scalable assembly of free-standing MoS2-graphene composite films
   consisting of nitrogen-doped graphene and ultrathin honeycomb-like MoS2
   nanosheets. The composite has a unique film-foam-film hierarchical
   top-down architecture from the macroscopic to the microscopic and the
   nanoscopic scale, which helps rendering the composite material highly
   compact and leads to rapid ionic/electronic access to the active
   material, while also accommodating the volume variation of the sulfide
   upon intercalation/deintercalation of Li. The unique structural merits
   of the composite lead to enhanced lithium storage.}},

Abstract = {{Extraordinary optical transmission in free space through nanohole arrays
   has been widely investigated over the past two decades. However, because
   of its intrinsic nature of periodicity, it suffers from poor integration
   with nano-/micro-systems. Here, by folding a periodic grating into a
   compact cavity, we propose a waveguide-based structure within
   sub-wavelength, which also exhibits extraordinary optical transmission.
   Thus, lots of promising applications realized in metallic films can now
   be migrated onto integrated waveguides in an ultracompact way. Comparing
   the characteristics of the proposed integrated device and the
   conventional periodic structure, we reveal the nature of the unexpected
   transmission spectrum. Based on this principle, a collinear broadband
   (similar to 500 nm) polarizer with extinction ratio of >17.8 dB is
   proposed, with an ultrashort length of 450 nm. Furthermore, this
   structure has the potential in biological applications when integrated
   into lab-on-a-chip or microfluidic system. As an example, a biosensor
   with enhanced sensitivity of 775 nm/RIU is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Effective layout pattern sampling is a fundamental component for
   lithography process optimization, hotspot detection, and model
   calibration. Existing pattern sampling algorithms rely on either vector
   quantization or heuristic approaches. However, it is difficult to manage
   these methods due to the heavy demands of prior knowledge, such as
   high-dimensional layout features and manually tuned hypothetical model
   parameters. We present a self-contained layout pattern sampling
   framework, where no manual parameter tuning is needed. To handle high
   dimensionality and diverse layout feature types, we propose a nonlinear
   dimensionality reduction technique with kernel parameter optimization.
   Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian model-based clustering, through which
   automatic sampling is realized without arbitrary setting of model
   parameters. The effectiveness of our framework is verified through a
   sampling benchmark suite and two applications: lithography hotspot
   detection and optical proximity correction. (C) 2016 Society of

Title = {{A New Algorithm for Multiphase-Fluid Characterization for Solvent
   Injection}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1688-1704}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Compositional simulation of solvent injection requires reliable
   characterization of reservoir fluids by use of an equation of state
   (EOS). Under the uncertainty associated with nonidentifiable components,
   reservoir fluids are conventionally characterized in the absence of
   universal methodology. This is true even for relatively simple fluids
   involving only the gaseous (V) and oleic (L-1) phases. No systematic
   method has been presented for characterization of more-complex fluids,
   exhibiting three hydrocarbon phases: the V, L-1, and solvent-rich-liquid
   (L-2) phases.
   This paper presents a new algorithm for systematic characterization of
   multiphase behavior for solvent-injection simulation. The reliability of
   the method comes mainly from the binary-interaction parameters (BIPs)
   newly developed for the Peng-Robinson (PR) (Peng and Robinson 1976,
   1978) EOS to represent three-phase behavior, including upper critical
   endpoints, for n-alkane and carbon dioxide (CO2)/n-alkane binaries. The
   regression part in fluid characterization broadly follows the concept of
   perturbation from n-alkanes, which was successfully applied for simpler
   two-phase fluids in our prior research. The algorithm, in its simplest
   form, uses only the saturation pressure and liquid density at a given
   composition and reservoir temperature.
   Case studies are presented to demonstrate the reliability of the
   algorithm for 90 reservoir fluids and their mixtures with solvents.
   Predictions are compared with experimental data for up to three phases.
   Results show that the simple algorithm developed in this research
   enables the PR-EOS to predict multiphase behavior in spite of the
   limited data used in the regression. Without the use of the BIPs
   developed in this research, the PR-EOS may fail to predict three phases,
   or may provide erroneous three-phase predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Heart valves control unidirectional blood flow within the heart during
   the cardiac cycle. They have a remarkable ability to withstand the
   demanding mechanical environment of the heart, achieving lifetime
   durability by processes involving the ongoing remodeling of the
   extracellular matrix. The focus of this review is on heart valve
   functional physiology, with insights into the link between
   disease-induced alterations in valve geometry, tissue stress, and the
   subsequent cell mechanobiological responses and tissue remodeling. We
   begin with an overview of the fundamentals of heart valve physiology and
   the characteristics and functions of valve interstitial cells (VICs). We
   then provide an overview of current experimental and computational
   approaches that connect VIC mechanobiological response to organ-and
   tissue-level deformations and improve our understanding of the
   underlying functional physiology of heart valves. We conclude with a
   summary of future trends and offer an outlook for the future of heart
   valve mechanobiology, specifically, multiscale modeling approaches, and
   the potential directions and possible challenges of research
   development. (C) 2016 American Physiological Society.}},

Abstract = {{Materials that require coupling between the stress-strain and
   momentum-velocity constitutive relations were first proposed by Willis
   (Willis 1981 Wave Motion 3, 1-11. (doi: 10.1016/0165-2125(81)90008-1))
   and are now known as elastic materials of the Willis type, or simply
   Willis materials. As coupling between these two constitutive equations
   is a generalization of standard elastodynamic theory, restrictions on
   the physically admissible material properties for Willis materials
   should be similarly generalized. This paper derives restrictions imposed
   on the material properties of Willis materials when they are assumed to
   be reciprocal, passive and causal. Considerations of causality and
   low-order dispersion suggest an alternative formulation of the standard
   Willis equations. The alternative formulation provides improved insight
   into the subwavelength physical behaviour leading to Willis material
   properties and is amenable to time-domain analyses. Finally, the results
   initially obtained for a generally elastic material are specialized to
   the acoustic limit.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{169-177}},

Abstract = {{Solvent selection is one of the promising ways to reduce energy use of
   amine scrubbing for CO2 capture. The heat of CO2 absorption is an
   important property of the solvent. Its effect on total energy use is not
   obvious: it directly increases the heat duty of regeneration, but
   indirectly reduces stripping steam and compression work. The optimum
   heat of absorption was quantified using the approximate stripper models
   developed in this work, including one of the most promising
   alternatives, the advanced flash stripper. Total equivalent work was
   used to indicate the overall energy performance. A wide range of lean
   loading, reboiler temperature, and compression efficiency was
   investigated. The optimum heat of absorption is 70-125 kJ/mol CO2 at
   various conditions, which is generally higher than existing solvents
   with 60-80 kJ/mol. Operation at low lean loading and low reboiler
   temperature requires higher heat of absorption to boost the partial
   pressure of CO2. The advanced flash stripper requires lower heat of
   absorption than the simple stripper to achieve minimum total equivalent
   work and was demonstrated as a flexible system that can be applied to a
   wide range of heat of absorption while still maintaining remarkable
   energy performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing of metallic materials involves the
   layerwise consolidation of feedstock materials in the form of powder,
   wire, or sheet using various energy sources to form complex shapes. The
   past two decades have witnessed significant advances in the field, in
   terms of both technologies and materials for metal 3D printing. This has
   led to widespread exploration and adoption of the technologies across
   industry, academia, and R\&D organizations. This article presents an
   overview of the field of metal 3D printing. A brief history of metal 3D
   printing is followed by an overview of metal 3D printing methods and
   metallic material systems used in these methods. Microstructure and
   properties, and their relationship to process parameters are discussed
   next, followed by current challenges and qualification issues. The
   article concludes with future trends and a brief description of the
   invited articles included in this special issue.}},

Title = {{An extended JBN method of determining unsteady-state two-phase relative
   permeability}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},

Pages = {{8374-8383}},

Abstract = {{Relative permeability is the reduction of permeability of porous media
   when subjected to multiphase flow and a key parameter in subsurface
   hydrology. The JBN method is a well-known method of obtaining relative
   permeability, which measures the overall pressure drop and the effluent
   phase ratio versus time during two-phase displacements. By assuming no
   capillary pressure or gravity, the JBN method obtains the relative
   permeabilities to both phases at the core outlet. Since data across a
   range of saturations are acquired in a relatively short time, this
   method is widely used. This work extends the JBN method by having (1)
   section-wise pressure drop measurements between the core inlet, four
   pressure taps on the core and the outlet, (2) local saturation
   measurements, and (3) local phase fluxes. With these data, the extended
   JBN method can determine relative permeabilities to both phases at each
   pressure tap of the core (not just at the core outlet). The JBN
   extension is shown using a data set where CO2 invades a brine-filled
   core. From this it is found that the advantages of the extended JBN
   method over the regular JBN method are: (1) four times more data are
   obtained, and (2) data are more accurate because the capillary end
   effect is experimentally avoided. Avoiding the end effect results in
   tripling the saturation range, and obtaining relative permeabilities
   that are consistent with steady-state measurements and roughly 40\%
   higher than those from the regular JBN method.}},

Abstract = {{A liquid crystal polarization grating (LCPG) is proposed that amplifies
   the steering angle of a liquid crystal optical phased array for
   non-mechanical beam steering, taking advantage of its high steering
   efficiency under normal incidence. However, oblique incidence may play
   an important role in the overall steering efficiency. The effect of
   oblique incidence on steering efficiency of a LCPG was analyzed by
   numerically solving the extended Jones matrix and considering
   propagation crosstalk. The results indicate that the outgoing laser beam
   is amplitude-modulated under the effect of oblique incidence and behaves
   as a sinusoidal-modulated amplitude grating, which diffracts certain
   energies to non-blazed orders. Over-oblique incidence may even eliminate
   the steering effect of the incident beam. The modulation depth of the
   induced amplitude grating was found to be proportional to the product of
   sinusoidal value of oblique incidence angle and the LC layer thickness,
   and inversely proportional to the periodic pitch length of the LCPG.
   Both in-plane incidence and out-of-plane incidence behave similarly to
   influence the steering efficiency. Finally, the overall steering
   efficiency for cascaded LCPGs was analyzed and a difference of up to 11
   \% steering efficiency can be induced between different LCPG
   configurations, even without considering the over-oblique incidence
   effect. Both the modulation depth and final steering efficiency can be
   optimized by varying the LC birefringence and layer thickness.}},

Abstract = {{We consider Markovian multiclass multi-pool networks with heterogeneous
   server pools, each consisting of many statistically identical parallel
   servers, where the bipartite graph of customer classes and server pools
   forms a tree. Customers form their own queue and are served in the
   first-come first served discipline, and can abandon while waiting in
   queue. Service rates are both class and pool dependent. The objective is
   to study the limiting diffusion control problems under the long run
   average (ergodic) cost criteria in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Two
   formulations of ergodic diffusion control problems are considered: (i)
   both queueing and idleness costs are minimized, and (ii) only the
   queueing cost is minimized while a constraint is imposed upon the
   idleness of all server pools. We develop a recursive leaf elimination
   algorithm that enables us to obtain an explicit representation of the
   drift for the controlled diffusions. Consequently, we show that for the
   limiting controlled diffusions, there always exists a stationary Markov
   control under which the diffusion process is geometrically ergodic. The
   framework developed in {[}Ann. AppL Probab. 25 (2015) 3511-3570] is
   extended to address a broad class of ergodic diffusion control problems
   with constraints. We show that the unconstrained and constrained
   problems are well posed, and we characterize the optimal stationary
   Markov controls via HJB equations.}},

Title = {{Effect of oxygen impurities on atmospheric-pressure surface streamer
   discharge in argon for large gap arc breakdown}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We report the results of a computational study that investigates the
   effect of impurities (molecular oxygen) on the development of argon
   surface streamers at atmospheric-pressure conditions. A continuous
   surface streamer has been proposed as a low-voltage mechanism to
   generate a conductive bridge for arc breakdown of a large interelectrode
   gap at high pressures. The streamer discharge model is based on the
   self-consistent, multispecies, continuum description of the plasma.
   Below a threshold voltage, no streamer discharge is observed and charge
   is localized only in the vicinity of the anode in the form of a
   localized corona. Above this voltage threshold in pure argon, a
   continuous conductive streamer successfully bridges the gap between two
   electrodes indicating high probability of transition to the arc. For
   small oxygen impurities (less than 5\%), the threshold voltage is found
   to decrease by a few hundred volts compared to the threshold voltage in
   pure argon while the streamer induction time increases. No noticeable
   changes in the streamer conductivity is obtained for low impurities of
   oxygen in the above range. An increase of the oxygen density above the
   5\% impurity level causes a significant decrease in the continuous
   streamer conductivity and leads to a decrease in the probability of
   transition to arc. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional plasmonic materials, namely, noble metals, hamper the
   realization of practical plasmonic devices due to their intrinsic
   limitations, such as lack of capabilities to tune in real-time their
   optical properties, failure to assimilate with CMOS standards, and
   severe degradation at increased temperatures. Transparent conducting
   oxide (TCO) is a promising alternative plasmonic material throughout the
   near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. In addition to compatibility with
   established silicon-based fabrication procedures, TCOs provide great
   flexibility in the design and optimization of plasmonic devices because
   their intrinsic optical properties can be tailored and dynamically
   tuned. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate metal oxide
   metasurfaces operating as quarter-waveplates (QWPs) over a broad near
   infrared (NIR) range from 1.75 to 2.5 mu m. We employ zinc oxide highly
   doped with gallium (Ga:ZnO) as the plasmonic constituent material of the
   metasurfaces and fabricate arrays of orthogonal nanorod pairs. Our
   Ga:ZnO metasurfaces provide a high degree of circular polarization
   across a broad range of two distinct optical bands in the NIR. Flexible
   broadband tunability of the QWP metasurfaces is achieved by the
   significant shifts of their optical bands and without any degradation in
   their performance after a post-annealing process up to 450 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Roll-to-roll manufacturing of graphene is attractive because of its
   compatibility with flexible substrates and its promise of high-speed
   production. Several prototype roll-to-roll systems have been
   demonstrated, which produce large-scale graphene on polymer films for
   transparent conducting film applications.1-4 In spite of such progress,
   the quality of graphene may be influenced by the tensile forces that are
   applied during roll to-roll transfer. To address this issue, we
   conducted in situ tensile experiments on copper foil coated with
   graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition, which were carried out in a
   scanning electron microscope. Channel cracks, which were perpendicular
   to the loading direction, initiated over the entire graphene monolayer
   at applied tensile strain levels that were about twice the yield strain
   of the (annealed) copper. The spacing between the channel cracks
   decreased with increasing applied strain, and new graphene wrinkles that
   were parallel to the loading direction appeared. These morphological
   features were confirmed in more detail by atomic force microscopy. Raman
   spectroscopy was used to determine the strain in the graphene, which was
   related to the degradation of the graphene/copper interface. The
   experimental data allowed the fracture toughness of graphene and
   interfacial properties of the graphene/copper interface to be extracted
   based on classical channel crack and shear-lag models. This study not
   only deepens our understanding of the mechanical and interfacial
   behavior of graphene on copper but also provides guidelines for the
   design of roll-to-roll processes for the dry transfer of graphene.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles can be used to modulate
   their structural, electrical, and optical properties. Common and
   versatile tools in nanoparticle manipulation and assembly are optical
   tweezers, but these require tightly focused and high-power (10-100 mW/mu
   m(2)) laser beams with precise optical alignment, which significantly
   hinders their applications. Here we present light-directed reversible
   assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles with a power intensity below 0.1
   mW/mu m(2). Our experiments and simulations reveal that such a low-power
   assembly is enabled by thermophoretic migration of nanoparticles due to
   the plasmon-enhanced photothermal effect and the associated enhanced
   local electric field over a plasmonic substrate. With
   software-controlled laser beams, we demonstrate parallel and dynamic
   manipulation of multiple nanoparticle assemblies. Interestingly, the
   assemblies formed over plasmonic substrates can be subsequently
   transported to nonplasmonic substrates. As an example application, we
   selected surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy, with tunable
   sensitivity. The advantages provided by plasmonic assembly of
   nanoparticles are the following: (1) low-power, reversible nanoparticle
   assembly, (2) applicability to nanoparticles with arbitrary morphology,
   and (3) use of simple optics. Our plasmon-enhanced thermophoretic
   technique will facilitate further development and application of dynamic
   nanoparticle assemblies, including biomolecular analyses in their native
   environment and smart drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the effect of subsidence on fluviodeltaic morphology is
   important not only to maintain sustainable coastal cities and habitats
   but also to interpret the information contained in the stratigraphic
   record. While tectonic steering in alluvial environments has been
   investigated, similar studies in fluviodeltaic environments are limited
   to physical experiments and field observations. We perform numerical
   experiments with a parcel-based cellular model to analyze the deltaic
   surface and subsurface responses to regional subsidence. We quantify
   model results using robust metrics and show that while sediment
   partitioning and shoreline pattern vary gradually with increasing
   subsidence rate, channel mobility and stratigraphic connectivity of
   channel deposits show a threshold transition. Conditions for this
   transition are captured with a dimensionless filling index , defined as
   the ratio between the rates of accommodation creation and sediment
   supply. A channel-locking mechanism activates when exceeds 0.6 and is
   responsible for the threshold transition.}},

Abstract = {{In pervasive computing environments, understanding the context of an
   entity is essential for adapting the application behavior to changing
   situations. In our view, context is a high-level representation of a
   user or entity's state and can capture location, activities, social
   relationships, capabilities, etc. Inherently, however, these high-level
   context metrics are difficult to capture using uni-modal sensors only
   and must therefore be inferred using multi-modal sensors. A key
   challenge in supporting context-aware pervasive computing is how to
   determine multiple high-level context metrics simultaneously and
   energy-efficiently using low-level sensor data streams collected from
   the environment and the entities present therein. A key challenge is
   addressing the fact that the algorithms that determine different
   high-level context metrics may compete for access to low-level sensors.
   In this paper, we first highlight the complexities of determining
   multiple context metrics as compared to a single context and then
   develop a novel framework and practical implementation for this problem.
   The proposed framework captures the tradeoff between the accuracy of
   estimating multiple context metrics and the overhead incurred in
   acquiring the necessary sensor data streams. In particular, we develop
   two variants of a heuristic algorithm for multi-context search that
   compute the optimal set of sensors contributing to the multi-context
   determination as well as the associated parameters of the sensing tasks
   (e.g., the frequency of data acquisition). Our goal is to satisfy the
   application requirements for a specified accuracy at a minimum cost. We
   compare the performance of our heuristics with a brute-force based
   approach for multi-context determination. Experimental results with
   SunSPOT, Shimmer and Smartphone sensors in smart home environments
   demonstrate the potential impact of the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{Finding a document or resource in an unstructured peer-to-peer network
   can be an exceedingly difficult problem. In this paper we propose a
   query routing approach that accounts for arbitrary overlay topologies,
   nodes with heterogeneous processing capacity, e.g., reflecting their
   degree of altruism, and heterogenous class-based likelihoods of query
   resolution at nodes which may reflect query loads and the manner in
   which files/resources are distributed across the network. The approach
   is shown to be stabilize the query load subject to a grade of service
   constraint, i.e., a guarantee that queries' routes meet pre-specified
   class-based bounds on their associated a priori probability of query
   resolution. An explicit characterization of the capacity region for such
   systems is given and numerically compared to that associated with random
   walk based searches. Simulation results further show the performance
   benefits, in terms of mean delay, of the proposed approach. Additional
   aspects associated with reducing complexity, estimating parameters, and
   adaptation to class-based query resolution probabilities and traffic
   loads are studied.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of highly integrated photonic circuits has been
   driving electro-optic (EO) devices to increasingly compact sizes, with
   the perspective of being able to control light at the nanoscale.
   However, tunability with spatial resolution below 10 nm scale with
   conventional approaches, such as metallic nanowires, remains a
   challenge. Here, we show a graphene-coated nanowire system aiming at
   beam spatial modulation at a deeply subwavelength scale. By analytically
   and numerically investigating the eigenmodal properties of this system,
   we found that beam power can propagate along either a swinging or a
   helical path in the hybrid nanowire. In particular, the period of the
   swing beam and the chirality and period of the helix beam can be
   flexibly controlled by tuning the chemical potential of graphene via the
   gate voltage. Significantly, due to its good modal confinement, such a
   beam can be independently manipulated even in the presence of another
   nanowire at a separation of 40 nm, which opens a realistic path toward
   gate programmable EO addressing or data storage with ultrahigh density
   (64 terabyte/mu m). At the same time, by fulfilling the phase matching
   condition between the two supported guided modes operating at different
   wavelengths, either a full band or band tunable terahertz wave at the
   nanoscale may be achieved by nonlinear difference frequency generation.
   Our proposed hybrid nanowire system opens interesting potentials to
   accomplish gate-programmable EO devices at sub-10 nm scale.}},

Abstract = {{A fast algorithm for the diagnosis of large antennas is developed. The
   algorithm is based on the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (RS) backpropagation
   method, accelerated by a multilevel nonuniform grid algorithm.
   Comparison between the field distributions reconstructed from

   antenna defects and geometrical distortions. The optimal performance is
   obtained by using oblate spheroidal grids, which are tailored to both
   the measurement and antenna surfaces. Further acceleration can be
   achieved, for particular cases, via optimal sampling on the antenna
   surface. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated for the example of
   a parabolic reflector with a number of surface distortions, and compared
   to that achieved with spherical grids. The accuracy and error
   controllability are studied in comparison to the direct RS integral
   computation.}},

Abstract = {{In-band full-duplex (FD) communications have been optimistically
   promoted to improve the spectrum utilization and efficiency. However,
   the penetration of FD communications to the cellular networks domain is
   challenging due to the imposed uplink/downlink interference. This paper
   presents a tractable framework, based on stochastic geometry, to study
   FD communications in cellular networks. Particularly, we assess the FD
   communications effect on the network performance and quantify the
   associated gains. This paper proves the vulnerability of the uplink to
   the downlink interference and shows that FD rate gains harvested in the
   downlink (up to 97\%) come at the expense of a significant degradation
   in the uplink rate (up to 94\%). Therefore, we propose a novel
   fine-grained duplexing scheme, denoted as the alpha-duplex scheme, which
   allows a partial overlap between the uplink and the downlink frequency
   bands. We derive the required conditions to harvest rate gains from the
   alpha-duplex scheme and show its superiority to both the FD and
   halfduplex (HD) schemes. In particular, we show that the alpha-duplex
   scheme provides a simultaneous improvement of 28\% for the downlink rate
   and 56\% for the uplink rate. Finally, we show that the amount of the
   overlap can be optimized based on the network design objective.}},

Abstract = {{The traffic assignment problem is primarily concerned with the study of
   user equilibrium and system optimum and it is often assumed that
   travelers are perfectly rational and have a complete knowledge of
   network conditions. However, from an empirical standpoint, when a large
   number of selfish users travel in a network, the chances of reaching an
   equilibrium are slim. User behavior in such settings can be modeled
   using probabilistic route choice models which define when and how
   travelers switch paths. This approach results in stochastic processes
   with steady state distributions containing multiple states in their
   support. In this paper, we propose an average cost Markov decision
   process model to reduce the expected total system travel time of the
   logit route choice model using dynamic pricing. Existing dynamic pricing
   methods in day-to-day network models are formulated in continuous time.
   However, the solutions from these methods cannot be used to set tolls on
   different days in the network. We hence study dynamic tolling in a
   discrete time setting in which the system manager collects tolls based
   on the state of the system on previous day(s). In order to make this
   framework practical, approximation schemes for handling a large number
   of users are developed. A simple example to illustrate the application
   of the exact and approximate methods is also presented. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Surface wave methods provide a cost effective means of developing shear
   wave velocity (Vs) profiles for applications such as dynamic site
   characterization and seismic site response analyses. However, the
   inverse problem involved in obtaining a realistic layered earth model
   from surface wave dispersion data is inherently ill-posed, non-linear
   and mix-determined, without a unique solution. When available, a priori
   information such as geotechnical boreholes or geologic well logs should
   be used to aid in constraining site-specific inversion parameters.
   Unfortunately, a priori information is often unavailable, particularly
   at significant depths, and a `blind analysis' must be performed. In
   these situations, the analyst must decide on an appropriate number of
   layers and ranges for their corresponding inversion parameters (i.e.
   trial number of layers and ranges in their respective thicknesses, shear
   wave velocities, compression wave velocities and mass densities).
   Selection of these parameters has been shown to significantly impact the
   results of an inversion. This paper presents a method for conducting
   multiple inversions utilizing systematically varied inversion layering
   parametrizations in order to identify and encompass the most reasonable
   layered earth models for a site. Each parametrization is defined by a
   unique layering ratio, which represents a multiplier that systemically
   increases the potential thickness of each layer in the inversion
   parametrization based on the potential thickness of the layer directly
   above it. The layering ratio method is demonstrated at two sites
   associated with the InterPacific Project, wherein it is shown to
   significantly aid in selecting reasonable Vs profiles that are close
   representations of the subsurface. While the goal of the layering ratio
   inversion methodology is not necessarily to find the `optimal' or `best'
   Vs profile for a site, it may be successful at doing so for certain
   sites/datasets. However, the primary reason for using the layering ratio
   method is to find Vs profiles that realistically represent the
   uncertainty in Vs resulting from surface wave inversion, and to avoid
   selection of Vs profiles that are unrealistic and adversely influenced
   by the choice of inversion parametrization.}},

Abstract = {{A lower switching voltage of indium-tinoxide (ITO)-based resistance
   random access memory (RRAM) with an inserted SiO2 thin film was
   presented. The amplitude of switching voltage of device was below 0.2 V
   whether measured by direct current or alternating current sweep
   operation. Notably, the observed reset voltage increased with
   temperature. To clarify the switching mechanism, conduction current
   fitting and switching voltage statistics were applied to explore the
   regular voltage variation dependent on temperature. In addition, a
   reaction model was proposed to explain the oxygen concentration gradient
   induced between the inserted SiO2 and ITO electrode on the ITO-based
   RRAM device.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate unusual surface plasmons polariton (SPP) propagation and
   light-matter interactions in ultrathin black phosphorus (BP) films, a 2D
   material that exhibits exotic electrical and physical properties due to
   its extremely anisotropic crystal structure. Recently, it has been
   speculated that the ultra-confined surface plasmons supported by BP may
   present various topologies of wave propagation bands, ranging from
   anisotropic elliptic to hyperbolic, across the mid-and near-infrared
   regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. By carefully analyzing the
   natural nonlocal anisotropic optical conductivity of BP, derived using
   the Kubo formalism and an effective low-energy Hamiltonian, we
   demonstrate here that the SPP wavenumber cutoff imposed by nonlocality
   prohibits that they acquire an arbitrary hyperbolic topology, forcing
   operation in the canalization regime. The resulting nonlocality-induced
   canalization presents interesting properties, as it is inherently
   broadband, enables large light-matter interactions in the very near
   field, and allows extreme device miniaturization. We also determine
   fundamental bounds to the confinement of BP plasmons, which are
   significantly weaker than for graphene, thus allowing a larger local
   density of states. Our results confirm the potential of BP as a
   promising reconfigurable plasmonic platform, with exciting applications,
   such as planar hyperlenses, optoelectronic components, imaging, and
   communication systems.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadium dioxide (VO2) undergoes significant optical, electronic, and
   structural changes as it transforms between the low-temperature
   monoclinic and high-temperature ruffle phases. Recently, alternative
   stimuli have been utilized to trigger insulator-to-metal transformations
   in VO2, including electrochemical gating. Here, we prepare and
   electrochemically reduce mesoporous films of VO2 nanocrystals, prepared
   from colloidally synthesized V2O3 nanocrystals that have been
   oxidatively annealed, in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. We
   observe a reversible transition between infrared transparent insulating
   phases and a darkened metallic phase by in situ visible near-infrared
   spectroelectrochemistry and correlate these observations with structural
   and electronic changes monitored by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and conductivity measurements. An
   unexpected reversible transition from conductive, reduced monoclinic VO2
   to an infrared-transparent insulating phase upon progressive
   electrochemical reduction is observed. This insulator metal insulator
   transition has not been reported in previous studies of
   electrochemically gated epitaxial VO2 films and is attributed to
   improved oxygen vacancy formation kinetics and diffusion due to the
   mesoporous nanocrystal film structure.}},

Abstract = {{The commercialization of Zn-air batteries has been impeded by the lack
   of low-cost, highly active, and durable catalysts that act independently
   for oxygen electrochemical reduction and evolution. Here, we demonstrate
   excellent performance of NiCo nanoparticles anchored on porous fibrous
   carbon aerogels (NiCo/PFC aerogels) as bifunctional catalysts toward the
   Zn-air battery. This material is designed and synthesized by a novel
   K2Ni(CN)4/K3Co(CN)6-chitosan hydrogel-derived method. The outstanding
   performance of NiCo/PFC aerogels is confirmed as a superior air-cathode
   catalyst for a rechargeable Zn-air battery. At a discharge-charge
   current density of 10 mA cm-2, the NiCo/PFC aerogels enable a Zn-air
   battery to cycle steadily up to 300 cycles for 600 h with only a small
   increase in the round-trip overpotential, notably outperforming the more
   costly Pt/C+IrO2 mixture catalysts (60 cycles for 120 h). With the
   simplicity of the synthetic method and the outstanding electrocatalytic
   performance, the NiCo/PFC aerogels are promising electrocatalysts for
   Zn-air batteries.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{43-54}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Critical path analysis (CPA), originally developed to describe
   electrical conductance in semiconductors, has been shown recently to
   hold some promise in describing transport properties of porous media. I
   applied some previously developed concepts in CPA and percolation theory
   to predict permeability in a suite of sandstone, carbonate, and
   clay-rich samples. I assumed that the pore sizes in my samples exhibited
   fractal scaling and expressed the electrical formation factor as a
   function of porosity using universal scaling from percolation theory.
   The resulting CPA permeability predictions match the measured values
   very well. In addition, I show how considering the scale-dependence of
   the percolation threshold yields two characteristic length scales for
   transport properties: the critical pore size, and the sample size. This
   work suggests that the CPA framework is appropriate for describing
   transport properties of natural porous media, and provides a theoretical
   basis for understanding the permeability of tight rocks like shale in
   which laboratory permeability measurements are difficult. (C) 2016

Title = {{Proppant transport study in fractures with intersections}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{463-477}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Slickwater fracturing is a popular stimulation treatment in the
   unconventional oil and gas industry. It creates thin and long fractures
   that connect to pre-existing natural fractures and generate complex
   fracture networks. A large fraction of the fractured area is not usually
   propped due to the high density of typical proppants (sand) and low
   viscosity of the fracturing fluid. The goal of this work is to
   understand and optimize proppant transport in complex fracture networks.
   In this paper, proppant transport in fracture intersections is studied
   experimentally (using laboratory size slots) and numerically (using a
   multiphase dense discrete phase model). The orientation of natural
   fractures, proppant size and shear rate have been varied and the
   injected proppant volume is kept constant. Both experiments and
   simulations show three zones: bottom immobile sand bed zone, middle
   flowing slurry zone, and top clear fluid zone. The sand injected early
   forms the bottom of the sand bed; the sand injected later moves
   downstream and forms the top part of the bed. The entrance eroded region
   increases as the shear rate (or equivalently the water injection rate)
   increases. The sand bed length increases as the shear rate increases.
   The equilibrium sand bed height decreases as the shear rate increases
   and the sand size decreases. Proppant placement in the bypass slot
   increases as the shear rate increases and the bypass angle decreases.
   The numerical model using a dense discrete phase model (DDPM) captures
   the key features of the sand bed formation and transport. (C) 2016

Title = {{Mechanistic modeling of low salinity water flooding}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{191-209}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Low salinity waterflood (LSW) has become an attractive enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR) method as it shows more advantages than conventional
   chemical EOR methods in terms of chemical costs, environmental impact,
   and field process implementation. Extensive laboratory studies in the
   past two decades have proposed several pore-scale mechanisms of oil
   displacement during LSW flooding, which are still open for discussion.
   However, the capability of reservoir simulators to model accurately this
   process is very limited. This paper provides a critical review of the
   state of the art in research and field applications of LSW. The focus is
   on a widely agreed mechanism that is the wettability alteration from
   preferential oil wetness to water wetness of formation rock surfaces.
   Ion exchange and geochemical reactions have been experimentally found to
   be important in oil mobilization due to enhanced water spreading at low
   salinity. To evaluate the significance of this surface wetting
   mechanism, a comprehensive ion exchange model with geochemical processes
   has been developed and coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow
   equations in an equation-of-state compositional simulator. This new
   model captures most of the important physical and chemical phenomena
   that occur in LSW, including intra-aqueous reactions, mineral
   dissolution/precipitation, ion exchange and wettability alteration.
   The proposed LSW model is tested using the low-salinity core-flood
   experiments reported by Fjelde et al. (2012) for a North Sea reservoir
   and the low-salinity and high-salinity heterogeneous core-flood
   experiments by Rivet (2009) for a Texas reservoir. Excellent agreements
   between the model and the experiments in terms of effluent ion
   concentrations, effluent pH, and oil recovery were achieved. In
   addition, the model was also proved to be highly comparable with the
   ion-exchange model of the geochemistry software PHREEQC for both low
   salinity and high salinity (Appelo, 1994). Important observations in
   laboratory and field tests such as a local pH increase, a decrease in
   divalent effluent concentration, mineralogy contributions, and the
   influence of connate water and injected brine compositions can be
   reproduced with the proposed LSW model. Built in a robust reservoir
   simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for LSW design and the
   interpretation of process performance in field tests.
   Although the advantages of LSW have been reported, none of the
   systematic approaches has addressed the issues of modeling and
   predicting LSW field-scale performance. The new modeling approach
   introduced in this research can effectively capture the critical effects
   of geology in the LSW process. This integrated modeling approach
   involves the use of geological software, a reservoir simulator, and a
   robust optimizer in a closed loop for sensitivity analysis, history
   matching, optimization, and uncertainty assessment. The field-scale
   benefits of secondary and tertiary LSW are then addressed. (C) 2016

Title = {{Modeling fracture propagation and cleanup for dry

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{210-221}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticle (NP)-stabilized foams can be generated at extreme
   water-deficient conditions (with quality as high as 95-99\%) and yet
   with apparent viscosities > 100 cP. This makes them greatly appealing
   for hydraulic fracturing applications, where minimal water consumption
   and leak-off to the reservoir are desired. Initial assessment of
   propensities of these novel fluids for fracturing applications requires
   field scale simulations. However, conventional fracturing models are
   difficult to employ because they do not consider true foam
   hydrodynamics. We have developed a mathematical model to simulate the
   transport of NP-stabilized foams for hydraulic fracturing. The model
   combines fluid transport in reservoir matrix and fracture with rock
   mechanics equations and thus allows for considering the effects of foam
   on fracture dynamics. Gas and water flow with mechanistic accounting of
   foam generation and coalescence are simulated using population balance
   models. Transport of nanoparticles through porous media was simulated
   using single site filtration model. The equations are discretized using
   finite-difference scheme. Settari's approach is used to embed fracture's
   moving boundary with the matrix to accordingly update transmissibility.
   Model's capabilities are verified with examples on fracture growth and
   fracture clean up processes to illustrate the benefits of using the
   NP-stabilized high quality foams. Fracture propagation was simulated for
   water, a conventional viscous fracpad and NP-stabilized foams of
   different qualities and textures. The simulations confirmed that larger
   foam viscosity generated wider fractures with smaller fracture
   half-length. In addition, fracture cleanup simulations show that
   fracturing fluid cleanup for foam based fracturing fluids could take the
   order of 10 days as opposed to that of viscous fracpad which could take
   up to 1000 days; demonstrating the advantage of using dry foams. (C)

Pages = {{505-514}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Capillary pressure data, with fundamental significance in reservoir
   engineering, can be determined in laboratory through different methods.
   However, these methods are expensive, complex and time consuming. Scarce
   literature has been published to describe the relationship between
   capillary pressure and resistivity data. In this study, a more general
   model inferring dimensionless capillary pressure directly from
   resistivity index data was derived from correlating the modified Kr-RI
   (relative permeability and resistivity index) model with the widely-used
   Kr-Pc (relative permeability and capillary pressure) model based on the
   same function of Kr. This model demonstrated a linear relationship
   between capillary pressure and (I center dot S-w)(1/2)/S-w{*} (I is the
   resistivity index, S-w is wetting phase saturation, and S-w{*} is the
   normalized wetting phase saturation). The feasibility of this model was
   verified by experimental data from different literatures and ours. The
   results demonstrated that the model works satisfactorily in most cases
   except for cores with extra-low permeability (generally, permeability
   less than 10 mD). In addition, this proposed model could also match the
   experimental data both at ambient and reservoir conditions, indicating
   that it reveals a more general relationship applicable for determining
   capillary pressure from resistivity data both in laboratories and
   reservoirs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most existing models for predicting relative permeability in the
   presence of hydrate are either empirical or based on simplistic
   representations of the pore system and hydrate growth. Multiple models
   are often needed to explain relative permeability behavior observed in
   the laboratory over different ranges of, hydrate saturation. Critical
   path analysis (CPA) offers a framework for predicting relative
   permeability based on pore system properties, including the percolation
   threshold and breadth of the pore size distribution. Using an existing
   method developed for partially saturated soils, I show that CPA can
   accurately predict relative permeability to either water or gas over the
   entire range of measured hydrate saturation for several suites of
   laboratory measurements. The method does not require any assumption of
   hydrate growth habit, and assumes that hydrate tends to grow in the
   largest pores first. This work represents an improvement in
   understanding the link between pore structure and transport properties
   of hydrate bearing sediment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fracture-critical bridge along Interstate Highway 35 with a relatively
   high volume of traffic had exceeded its original design life and was

   bridge. Strain gauges and crack propagation gauges were installed at
   critical locations near existing fatigue cracks identified from annual
   manual inspections. The initial data were evaluated and indicated that
   the fatigue life of the bridge had been exceeded, such that the bridge
   needed to be repaired or replaced. The bridge owner placed the bridge on
   a fast-track schedule for replacement; however, because it would take 2
   to 3years to complete the bridge, the bridge owner also elected to
   strengthen the bridge in the interim. The girders were strengthened by
   installing bolted cover plates between the top flanges of the
   longitudinal girder and transverse floor beams. The response of the
   bridge was monitored before, during, and after the bridge was
   strengthened. In the strengthened condition, the fatigue behavior of the
   bridge was dramatically improved due to unintentional composite behavior
   between the bolted cover plates and the concrete deck. Developing
   composite behavior in noncomposite, aging bridges may be a potential
   method of mitigating future fatigue damage. (C) 2016 American Society of

Abstract = {{Modern systems-on-a-chip and microprocessors, e.g., those in smart
   phones and laptops, typically have multiple operating conditions, such
   as video streaming, Web browsing, standby, and so on. They will have
   different performance targets and run under different supply voltages.
   Gate sizing (with threshold voltage assignment) is a fundamental step
   for power/performance optimization. However, conventional gate sizing
   algorithms only consider one scenario, e.g., the performance-critical
   operating condition, which may be over-design for other operating
   conditions. In addition, reliability has become a prime concern in
   nanometer designs, and gate sizing has been employed to mitigate aging.
   However: 1) previous aging-affected delay models do not take into
   account more than one operating condition to estimate the aging impact
   and 2) earlier aging aware gate sizing algorithms only consider one
   operating condition at a time. In this paper, we present a new paradigm
   of aging aware gate sizing, one-size-fits-all (OSFA), which performs
   power/performance optimizations across multiple operating conditions.
   The existing delay model for negative bias temperature instability
   (NBTI) is extended to take into account multiple operating conditions,
   and incorporated into our OSFA framework. Based on OSFA, we also adjust
   the supply voltage targeting overall power optimization. A speed-up
   heuristic is proposed to scale our OSFA design space exploration
   methodology for higher number of operating conditions. Experimental
   results on industry-strength benchmarks demonstrate that: 1) compared
   with conventional approach OSFA could provide an average 6.1\% reduction
   in power without performance loss; 2) NBTI-aware OSFA framework can
   provide significant improvement in comparison with guard-band based
   traditional NBTI-aware gate sizing approach; and 3) percentage savings
   compared to conventional methodology increases with the number of
   operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We study a noiseless broadcast link serving K users whose requests arise
   from a library of N files. Every user is equipped with a cache of size M
   files each. It has been shown that by splitting all the files into
   packets and placing individual packets in a random independent manner
   across all the caches prior to any transmission, at most N/M file
   transmissions are required for any set of demands from the library. The
   achievable delivery scheme involves linearly combining packets of
   different files following a greedy clique cover solution to the
   underlying index coding problem. This remarkable multiplicative gain of
   random placement and coded delivery has been established in the
   asymptotic regime when the number of packets per file F scales to
   infinity. The asymptotic coding gain obtained is roughly t = K M/N. In
   this paper, we initiate the finite-length analysis of random caching
   schemes when the number of packets F is a function of the system
   parameters M, N, and K. Specifically, we show that the existing random
   placement and clique cover delivery schemes that achieve optimality in
   the asymptotic regime can have at most a multiplicative gain of 2 even
   if the number of packets is exponential in the asymptotic gain t =
   K(M/N). Furthermore, for any clique cover-based coded delivery and a
   large class of random placement schemes that include the existing ones,
   we show that the number of packets required to get a multiplicative gain
   of (4/3)g is at least O((g/K)(N/M)(g-1)). We design a new random
   placement and an efficient clique cover-based delivery scheme that
   achieves this lower bound approximately. We also provide tight
   concentration results that show that the average (over the random
   placement involved) number of transmissions concentrates very well
   requiring only a polynomial number of packets in the rest of the system
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the multicast scheduling problem for the block transmission
   of packets in a heterogeneous network using a half-duplex relay station
   (RS). The RS uses random linear coding to efficiently transmit packets
   over time-varying multicast channels. Our goal is to minimize the
   average decoding delay. Because of the half-duplex operation, at each
   time slot, the RS must decide to either: 1) fetch a new packet for
   encoding from the base station or 2) multicast a coded packet to
   wireless users. Thus, optimal scheduling hinges on exploiting multicast
   opportunities while persistently supplying the encoder (at the RS) with
   new packets. We formulate an associated fluid control problem and show
   that the optimal policy incorporates opportunism across multicast
   channels, i.e., the RS performs a multicast transmission only if the
   collection of channel conditions is favorable; otherwise, it performs a
   fetch. Based on the fluid policy, we propose an online algorithm. We
   prove that our algorithm asymptotically incurs no more than 4/3 and 2
   times the optimal delay, for two-user and arbitrary number of user
   system, respectively. Simulation results show that, in fact, our
   algorithm's performance is very close to theoretical bounds.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to use noncontact optical
   coherence elastography (OCE) to evaluate and compare changes in
   biomechanical properties that occurred in rabbit cornea in situ after
   corneal collagen cross-linking by either of two techniques:
   ultraviolet-A (UV-A)/riboflavin or rose-Bengal/green light.
   METHODS. Low-amplitude (<= 10 mu m) elastic waves were induced in mature
   rabbit corneas by a focused air pulse. Elastic wave propagation was
   imaged by a phase-stabilized swept source OCE (PhS-SSOCE) system.
   Corneas were then cross-linked by either of two methods: UV-A/riboflavin
   (UV-CXL) or rose-Bengal/green light (RGX). Phase velocities of the
   elastic waves were fitted to a previously developed modified
   Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equation to obtain the viscoelasticity of the
   corneas before and after the cross-linking treatments. Micro-scale
   depth-resolved phase velocity distribution revealed the depth-wise
   heterogeneity of both cross-linking techniques.
   RESULTS. Under standard treatment settings, UV-CXL significantly
   increased the stiffness of the corneas by similar to 47\% (P < 0.05),
   but RGX did not produce statistically significant increases. The shear
   viscosities were unaffected by either cross-linking technique. The
   depth-wise phase velocities showed that UV-CXL affected the anterior
   similar to 34\% of the corneas, whereas RGX affected only the anterior
   similar to 16\% of the corneas.
   CONCLUSIONS. UV-CXL significantly strengthens the cornea, whereas RGX
   does not, and the effects of cross-linking by UV-CXL reach deeper into
   the cornea than cross-linking effects of RGX under similar conditions.}},

Abstract = {{At the core of Illumina's high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms lies
   a biophysical surface process that results in a random geometry of
   clusters of homogeneous short DNA fragments typically hundreds of base
   pairs long-bridge amplification. The statistical properties of this
   random process and the lengths of the fragments are critical as they
   affect the information that can be subsequently extracted, that is,
   density of successfully inferred DNA fragment reads. The ensembles of
   overlapping DNA fragment reads are then used to computationally
   reconstruct the much longer target genome sequence. The success of the
   reconstruction in turn depends on having a sufficiently large ensemble
   of DNA fragments that are sufficiently long. In this article using
   stochastic geometry, we model and optimize the end-to-end flow cell
   synthesis and target genome sequencing process, linking and partially
   controlling the statistics of the physical processes to the success of
   the final computational step. Based on a rough calibration of our model,
   we provide, for the first time, a mathematical framework capturing the
   salient features of the sequencing platform that serves as a basis for
   optimizing cost, performance, and/or sensitivity analysis to various

Abstract = {{Modularization is a well-established method that can improve the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the construction industry. However, the
   industry continues to struggle with its implementation, and not all
   executed modular projects have resulted in successful project
   performance. This study investigates the combinatorial effects of
   modularization critical success factors (CSF) on the cost and schedule
   performances of industrial modular projects and derives a conceptual
   model of cost and schedule successes using information from actual cases
   by applying crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis. The findings
   confirm that CSFs interactively and collectively affect modular
   industrial project performance. The most commonly involved CSFs for cost
   and schedule successes are timely design freeze,
   owner-furnished/long-lead equipment specification, vendor involvement,
   and management of execution risks. This work contributes to researchers
   and practitioners in the industrial sector to improve understanding of
   the recipes (i.e.,CSFs or combinations thereof) for successful modular
   project planning and execution, which will lead to improved modular

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRIBOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Constitutive and dynamic relations for friction coefficient are
   presented. A first thrust combines the laws of thermodynamics to relate
   heat, energy, matter, entropy, and work of forces. The equation sums
   multiple terms-each with a differential of a variable multiplied by a
   coefficient-to zero. Thermodynamic considerations suggest that two
   variables, internal energy and entropy production, must depend on the
   others. Linear independence of differentials renders equations that
   yield thermodynamic quantities, properties, and forces as functions of
   internal energy and entropy production. When applied to a tribo-control
   volume, constitutive laws for normal and friction forces, and
   coefficient of friction are derived and specialized for static and
   kinetic coefficients of friction. A second thrust formulates dynamics of
   sliding, with friction coefficient and slip velocity as state variables.
   Differential equations derived via Newton's laws for velocity and the
   degradation entropy generation (DEG) theorem for friction coefficient
   model changes to the sliding interface induced by friction dissipation.
   The solution suggests that the transition from static to kinetic
   coefficient of friction with respect to slip velocity for lubricant
   starved sliding is a property of the motion dynamics of sliding
   interacting with the dynamics of change of the surface morphology.
   Finally, sliding with stick-slip was simulated to compare this model to
   others.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a method of two-dimensional scanning electron
   microscope image analysis that directly quantifies microporosity
   abundance in clay-rich, fine-grained sediments. The method is novel in
   that it is specifically designed to circumvent the challenge to porosity
   quantification posed by mineral surface charging and topographical
   artifacts created during Ar-ion cross-section polishing. It utilizes the
   finding that differences in circularity values can be used to
   distinguish micropores from blemishes in a thresholded image. This
   method is powerful because it is fast and provides a direct
   microporosity estimation technique to augment or replace experimental
   data. The pore size range to which the method is applicable is clear and
   can be selected depending on the application of the analysis. When used
   appropriately, the method can be implemented on microporous sediments
   and sedimentary rock in general. The method is developed using marine
   muds of Pliocene and Miocene ages from the Nankai margin (burial depths
   from approximately 200 to 1100m). The close match between
   imaging-derived microporosity and bulk N-2 microporosity measurements
   shows that porosity in these young and relatively shallowly buried
   sediments is dominated by pores of sizes that can be imaged by scanning
   electron microscopy. In Kumano, forearc basin sediments of the Nankai
   Trough, results of this method show a significant increase in
   microporosity with burial depth, probably due to microporosity
   preservation during compaction and possibly early volcanic ash
   diagenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Biological processes are organized in time as innate rhythms defined by
   the period (tau), phase (peak {[}Phi] and trough time), amplitude (A,
   peak-trough difference) and mean level. The human time structure in its
   entirety is comprised of ultradian (tau < 20 h), circadian (20 h > tau <
   28 h) and infradian (tau > 28 h) bioperiodicities. The circadian time
   structure (CTS) of human beings, which is more complicated than in lower
   animals, is orchestrated and staged by a brain central multioscillator
   system that includes a prominent pacemaker - the suprachiasmatic nuclei
   of the hypothalamus. Additional pacemaker activities are provided by the
   pineal hormone melatonin, which circulates during the nighttime, and the
   left and right cerebral cortices. Under ordinary circumstances this
   system coordinates the tau and Phi of rhythms driven by subservient
   peripheral cell, tissue and organ clock networks. Cyclic environmental,
   feeding and social time cues synchronize the endogenous 24 h clocks and
   rhythms. Accordingly, processes and functions of the internal
   environment are integrated in time for maximum biological efficiency,
   and they are also organized and synchronized in time to the external
   environment to ensure optimal performance and response to challenge.
   Artificial light at night (ALAN) exposure can alter the CTS as can night
   work, which, like rapid transmeridian displacement by air travel,
   necessitates realignment of the Phi of the multitude of 24 h rhythms. In
   2001, Stevens and Rea coined the phrase ``circadian disruption{''} (CD)
   to label the CTS misalignment induced by ALAN and shift work (SW) as a
   potential pathologic mechanism of the increased risk for cancer and
   other medical conditions. Current concerns relating to the effects of
   ALAN exposure on the CTS motivated us to renew our long-standing
   interest in the possible role of CD in the etiopathology of common human
   diseases and patient care. A surprisingly large number of medical
   conditions involve CD: adrenal insufficiency; nocturia; sleep-time
   non-dipping and rising blood pressure 24 h patterns (nocturnal
   hypertension); delayed sleep phase syndrome, non-24 h sleep/wake
   disorder; recurrent hypersomnia; SW intolerance; delirium; peptic ulcer
   disease; kidney failure; depression; mania; bipolar disorder;
   Parkinson's disease; Smith-Magenis syndrome; fatal familial insomnia
   syndrome; autism spectrum disorder; asthma; byssinosis; cancers; hand,
   foot and mouth disease; post-operative state; and ICU outcome. Poorly
   conceived medical interventions, for example nighttime dosing of
   synthetic corticosteroids and certain beta-antagonists and cyclic
   nocturnal enteral or parenteral nutrition, plus lifestyle habits,
   including atypical eating times and chronic alcohol consumption, also
   can be causal of CD. Just as surprisingly are the many proven
   chronotherapeutic strategies available today to manage the CD of several
   of these medical conditions. In clinical medicine, CD seems to be a
   common, yet mostly unrecognized, pathologic mechanism of human disease
   as are the many effective chronotherapeutic interventions to remedy it.}},

Abstract = {{Despite continuous efforts into benchmarking over the last decades, few
   have focused on management efforts of project organizations who are
   involved in managing the capital project. This study presents a
   phase-based framework and 10 input measures for measuring project
   management efforts in a capital project. The measures are planning,
   organizing, leading, controlling, design efficiency, human resources,
   quality, sustainability, supply chain, and safety. This study quantifies
   and assesses the inputs and further sorts the results by industry
   sectors and project phases. The analyses show that traditional functions
   tend to have more consistent implementation than construction-specific
   functions. The results indicate that infrastructure sector tends to
   exert fewer and less consistent efforts than building and industrial
   sectors. This study contributes a new benchmarking framework and is the
   first to quantify project management inputs of a capital project
   systematically. Additionally, phase-focused and phase-wide benchmarking
   applications of the input measures are also discussed and provided. (C)

Title = {{A semi-Lagrangian finite difference WENO scheme for scalar nonlinear
   conservation laws}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{322}},
Pages = {{559-585}},

Abstract = {{For a nonlinear scalar conservation law in one-space dimension, we
   develop a locally conservative semi-Lagrangian finite difference scheme
   based on weighted essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions (SL-WENO).
   This scheme has the advantages of both WENO and semi-Lagrangian schemes.
   It is a locally mass conservative finite difference scheme, it is
   formally high-order accurate in space, it has small time truncation
   error, and it is essentially non-oscillatory. The scheme is nearly free
   of a CFL time step stability restriction for linear problems, and it has
   a relaxed CFL condition for nonlinear problems. The scheme can be
   considered as an extension of the SL-WENO scheme of Qiu and Shu (2011)
   {[}2] developed for linear problems. The new scheme is based on a
   standard sliding average formulation with the flux function defined
   using WENO reconstructions of (semi-Lagrangian) characteristic tracings
   of grid points. To handle nonlinear problems, we use an approximate,
   locally frozen trace velocity and a flux correction step. A special
   two-stage WENO reconstruction procedure is developed that is biased to
   the upstream direction. A Strang splitting algorithm is used for
   higher-dimensional problems. Numerical results are provided to
   illustrate the performance of the scheme and verify its formal accuracy.
   Included are applications to the Vlasov-Poisson and guiding-center
   models of plasma flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) should be highly biocompatible, stable and
   safely eliminated from the body, and can therefore be successfully used
   in modern medicine. Synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAP) has well established
   biocompatible and non-inflammatory properties, as well as a highly
   stable and flexible structure that allows for an easy incorporation of
   magnetic ions. This study characterized and compared the in vitro
   cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility of hydroxyapatite MNPs doped with
   different ions (Gd3+/Fe2+/Fe3+/Co2+). HAP doped with 10\% of Gd and
   Fe(III) presented the highest magnetic moments. Our results showed that
   Gd doped HAP nanoparticles are non-cytotoxic, hemocompatible,
   non-hemolytic and non-thrombogenic, in contrast with Fe(III) doped HAP
   that can be considered thrombogenic. For these reasons we propose that,
   Gd doped HAP nanoparticles have the most potential for application as a
   MRI contrast agents. However, use of Fe (III) doped HAP as MRI contrast
   agents should be further investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This is the first report of abnormal grain morphologies specific to a Mo
   sheet material produced from a commercial-purity arc-melted ingot.
   Abnormal grains initiated and grew during plastic deformation of this
   material at temperatures of 1793 K and 1813 K (1520 A degrees C and 1540
   A degrees C). This abnormal grain growth during high-temperature plastic
   deformation is termed dynamic abnormal grain growth, DAGG. DAGG in this
   material readily consumes nearly all grains near the sheet center while
   leaving many grains near the sheet surface unconsumed. Crystallographic
   texture, grain size, and other microstructural features are
   characterized. After recrystallization, a significant through-thickness
   variation in crystallographic texture exists in this material but does
   not appear to directly influence DAGG propagation. Instead, dynamic
   normal grain growth, which may be influenced by texture, preferentially
   occurs near the sheet surface prior to DAGG. The large grains thus
   produced near the sheet surface inhibit the subsequent growth of the
   abnormal grains produced by DAGG, which preferentially consume the finer
   grains near the sheet center. This produces abnormal grains that span
   the sheet center but leave unconsumed polycrystalline microstructure
   near the sheet surface. Abnormal grains are preferentially oriented with
   the approximately along the tensile axis. These results provide
   additional new evidence that boundary curvature is the primary driving
   force for DAGG in Mo.}},

   fabrication methods, is proposed for mobile and automotive applications,
   and the electrochemical performance is evaluated. 8 mol\% of Y2O3
   stabilized ZrO2 (8YSZ) is used as electrolyte and NiO/8YSZ as anode
   material. Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.9 (CG091) and Ba0.5Sr0.5CO0.8Fe0.2O3-d

Title = {{Non-destructive measurement of photoexcited carrier transport in

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Abstract = {{Graphene has great potential for fabrication of ultrafast
   opto-electronics, in which relaxation and transport of photoexcited
   carriers determine device performance. Even though ultrafast carrier
   relaxation in graphene has been studied vigorously, transport properties
   of photoexcited carriers in graphene are largely unknown. In this work,
   we utilize an ultrafast grating imaging technique to measure lifetime
   (tau(r)), diffusion coefficient (D), diffusion length (L) and mobility
   (mu) of photoexcited carriers in mono-and multi-layer graphene
   non-invasively. In monolayer graphene, D similar to 10,000 cm(2)/s and
   mu similar to 120,000 cm(2)/V have been observed, both of which decrease
   drastically in multilayer graphene, indicating that the remarkable
   transport properties in monolayer graphene originate from its unique
   Dirac-Cone energy structure. Mobilities of photoexcited carriers
   measured here are several times larger than the Hall and Field-Effect
   mobilities reported in literature (<15,000 cm(2)/V), due to the high
   energy of photoexcited carriers. Our results indicate the importance of
   obtaining monolayer graphene to realize high-performance graphene
   devices, as well as the necessity to use transport properties of
   photoexcited carriers for predicting the performance of graphene-based
   opto-electronics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{DSMC simulation of Europa water vapor plumes}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{277}},
Pages = {{370-380}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A computational investigation of the physics of water vapor plumes on
   Europa was performed with a focus on characteristics relevant to
   observation and spacecraft mission operations. The direct simulation
   Monte Carlo (DSMC) method was used to model the plume expansion assuming
   a supersonic vent source. The structure of the plume was determined,
   including the number density, temperature, and velocity fields. The
   possibility of ice grain growth above the vent was considered and deemed
   probable for large (diameter > similar to 20 m) vents at certain Mach
   numbers. Additionally, preexisting grains of three diameters (0.1, 1, 50
   mu m) were included and their trajectories examined. A preliminary study
   of photodissociation of H2O into OH and H was performed to demonstrate
   the behavior of daughter species. A set of vent parameters was evaluated
   including Mach number (Mach 2, 3, 5), reduced temperature as a proxy for
   flow energy loss to the region surrounding the vent, and mass flow rate.
   Plume behavior was relatively insensitive to these factors, with the
   notable exception of mass flow rate. With an assumed mass flow rate of
   similar to 1000 kg/s, a canopy shock occurred and a maximum integrated
   line of sight column density of similar to 10(20) H2O molecules/m(2) was
   calculated, comparing favorably with observation (Roth et al., 2014a).

Abstract = {{This research examined how variations in synthesis methods of silver
   nanoparticles affect both the release of silver from ceramic water
   filters (CWFs) and disinfection efficacy. The silver nanoparticles used
   were stabilized by four different molecules: citrate,
   polyvinylpyrrolidone, branched polyethylenimine, and casein. A
   multilevel statistical model was built to quantify if there was a
   significant difference in: a) extent of silver lost, b) initial amount
   of silver lost, c) silver lost for water of different quality, and d)
   total coliform removal. Experiments were performed on location at Pure
   Home Water, a CWF factory in Tamale, Ghana using stored rainwater and
   dugout water (a local surface water). The results indicated that using
   dugout vs. rainwater significantly affects the initial (p-value 0.0015)
   and sustained (p-value 0.0124) loss of silver, but that silver type does
   not have a significant effect. On average, dugout water removed 37.5 mu
   g/L more initial silver and had 1.1 mu g/L more silver in the filtrate
   than rainwater. Initially, filters achieved 1.9 log reduction values
   (LRVs) on average, but among different silver and water types this
   varied by as much as 2.5 LRV units. Overall, bacterial removal
   effectiveness was more challenging to evaluate, but some data suggest
   that the branched polyethylenimine silver nanoparticles provided
   improved initial bacterial removal over filters which were not painted
   with silver nanoparticles (p-value 0.038). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Two methane migration mechanisms have been proposed for coarse-grained
   gas hydrate reservoirs: short-range diffusive gas migration and
   long-range advective fluid transport from depth. Herein, we demonstrate
   that short-range fluid flow due to overpressure in marine sediments is a
   significant additional methane transport mechanism that allows hydrate
   to precipitate in large quantities in thick, coarse-grained hydrate
   reservoirs. Two-dimensional simulations demonstrate that this migration
   mechanism, short-range advective transport, can supply significant
   amounts of dissolved gas and is unencumbered by limitations of the other
   two end-member mechanisms. Short-range advective migration can increase
   the amount of methane delivered to sands as compared to the slow process
   of diffusion, yet it is not necessarily limited by effective porosity
   reduction as is typical of updip advection from a deep source.}},

Title = {{A new approach to approximate equation-of-motion coupled cluster with
   triple excitations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Accurate methods for excited, ionized, and electron-attached states are
   critical to the study of many chemical species such as reactive
   intermediates, radicals, and ionized systems. The equation-of-motion
   coupled cluster singles, doubles, and triples (EOM-CCSDT) family of
   methods is very accurate (roughly similar in accuracy as for CCSDT
   calculations of the ground state), but the computational cost scales
   iteratively as the eighth power of the system size. Many approximations
   already exist, although most either correct only the excited state or
   require an iterative O(n(7)) procedure which can also be prohibitively
   expensive. In this paper, new methods, termed EOM-CCSD(T)(a) and
   EOM-CCSD(T)(a){*}, are proposed which correct both the ground and
   excited states based on a shared effective Hamiltonian, and the latter
   of which includes only non-iterative corrections to both the CCSD and
   EOM-CCSD energies. These methods are found to significantly improve the
   description of excited and ionized potential energy surfaces,
   equilibrium geometries, and harmonic frequencies; the accuracy is very
   close to that of full EOM-CCSDT. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Piperazine (PZ) and its blends have emerged as attractive solvents for
   CO2 capture, but the underlying reaction mechanisms still remain
   uncertain. Our study particularly focuses on assessing the relative
   roles of PZCOO(-) and PZH(+) produced from the PZ + CO2 reaction.
   PZCOO(-) is found to directly react with CO2 forming COO(-)PZCOO(-),
   whereas PZH(+) will not. However, COO(-)PZCOO(-) appears very unlikely
   to be produced in thermodynamic equilibrium with monocarbamates,
   suggesting that its existence would predominantly originate from the
   surface reaction that likely occurs. We also find production of
   H(+)PZCOO(-) to be more probable with increasing CO2 loading, due partly
   to the thermodynamic favorability of the PZH(+) + PZCOO(-) ->
   H(+)PZCOO(-) + PZ reaction; the facile PZ liberation may contribute to
   its relatively high CO2 absorption rate. This study highlights an
   accurate description of surface reaction and the solvent composition
   effect is critical in thermodynamic and kinetic models for predicting
   the CO2 capture processes.}},

Abstract = {{The Marangoni effect describes fluid flow near an interface in response
   to a surface tension gradient. Here, we demonstrate that the Marangoni
   effect is the underlying mechanism for flow driven feature formation in
   an azobenzene-containing polymer film; features formed in
   azobenzene-containing polymers are often referred to as surface relief
   gratings or SRGs. An amorphous
   poly(4-(acryloyloxyhexyloxy)-4'-pentylazobenzene) was synthesized and
   studied as a model polymer. To isolate the surface tension driven flow
   from the surface tension pattern inscription step, the surface tension
   gradient was preprogrammed via photoisomerization of azobenzene in a
   glassy polymer film without forming topographical features.
   Subsequently, the latent image was developed in the absence of light by
   annealing above the glass transition temperature where the polymer is a
   liquid. The polymer flow direction was controlled with precision by
   inducing different surface tension changes in the exposed regions, in
   accordance with expectation based on the Marangoni effect. Finally, the
   height of the formed features decreased upon extensive thermal annealing
   due to capillary leveling with two distinct rates. A scaling analysis
   revealed that those rates originated from dissimilar capillary
   velocities associated with different azobenzene isomers.}},

   conductivity increases with increasing temperature, suggesting that
   extrinsic grain boundary and defect scattering dominate over intrinsic
   phonon-phonon scattering. Annealing a polycrystalline GeH sample at 195
   degrees C caused it to become amorphous, reducing the room-temperature
   thermal conductivity from 0.53 +/- 0.09W m(-1) K-1, which is close to
   the value calculated for 16 nm grain size, to 0.29 +/- 0.05W m(-1) K-1,

   pi-Bond Polarization}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{One important attribute of graphene that makes it attractive for
   high-performance electronics is its inherently large thermal
   conductivity (kappa) for the purposes of thermal management. Using a
   combined density-functional theory and classical molecular-dynamics
   approach, we predict that the kappa of graphene supported on hexagonal
   boron nitride (h-BN) can be as large as 90\% of the kappa of suspended
   graphene, in contrast to the significant suppression of kappa (more than
   70\% reduction) on amorphous silica. Interestingly, we find that this
   enhanced thermal transport is largely attributed to increased lifetimes
   of the in-plane acoustic phonon modes, which is a notable contrast from
   the dominant contribution of out-of-plane acoustic modes in suspended
   graphene. This behavior is possible due to the charge polarization
   throughout graphene that induces strong interlayer adhesion between
   graphene and h-BN. These findings highlight the potential benefit of
   layered dielectric substrates such as h-BN for graphene-based thermal
   management, in addition to their electronic advantages. Furthermore, our
   study brings attention to the importance of understanding the interlayer
   interactions of graphene with layered dielectric materials which may
   offer an alternative technological platform for substrates in
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Incandescent sources that produce light from electrically heated
   filaments or films tend to feature low efficiencies and offer poor
   spectral and angular control. We demonstrate that a judicious
   nanostructuring of a SiC surface can focus thermal emission of a
   preselected spectral range to a well-defined height above the surface.
   SiC is known to support electromagnetic surface waves that afford the
   required thermal emission control. Here, we provide general design rules
   for this type of focusing element that can be extended to other material
   systems, such as metals supporting surface plasmon-polariton waves.
   These rules are verified using full-wave calculations of the spatial
   variation of thermal emission. The obtained results establish a
   foundation for developing more complex algorithms for the design of
   complex thermal lenses.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal degradation of aqueous piperazine
   (PZ)/4-hydroxy-1-methylpiperidine (HMPD) for CO2 capture was rigorously
   evaluated and compared to that of PZ/n-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). The
   degradation mechanism for PZ/HMPD was investigated by performing
   measurements under various conditions and identifying degradation
   products. The arm switching reaction between PZ and HMPD to produce
   methylpiperazine (MPZ) and hydroxypiperidine (HPD) is the major
   degradation pathway. A second-order rate model consistent with proposed
   degradation pathways accurately models the initial degradation rate. The
   significantly greater stability of PZ/HMPD compared to that of PZ/MDEA
   is due to the remarkable thermal stability of its immediate degradation
   product, the smaller initial degradation rate of PZ/HMPD, and the
   greater thermal stability of HMPD compared to that of MDEA. The
   potential environmental issues caused by the volatility of one minor
   degradation product, 1,4-dimethylpiperazine (1,4 DMPZ), need to be
   addressed for commercial application of this solvent.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse methods of statistical mechanics have facilitated the discovery
   of pair potentials that stabilize a wide variety of targeted lattices at
   zero temperature. However, such methods are complicated by the need to
   compare, within the optimization framework, the energy of the desired
   lattice to all possibly relevant competing structures, which are not
   generally known in advance. Furthermore, ground-state stability does not
   guarantee that the target will readily assemble from the fluid upon
   cooling from higher temperature. Here, we introduce a molecular dynamics
   simulation-based, optimization design strategy that iteratively and
   systematically refines the pair interaction according to the fluid and
   crystalline structural ensembles encountered during the assembly
   process. We successfully apply this probabilistic, machine-learning
   approach to the design of repulsive, isotropic pair potentials that
   assemble into honeycomb, kagome, square, rectangular, truncated square,
   and truncated hexagonal lattices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{In order to interpret recent experimental studies of the dependence of
   conductance of ds-DNA as the DNA is pulled from the 3'end1-3'end2 ends,
   which find a sharp conductance jump for a very short (4.5\%) stretching
   length, we carried out multiscale modeling to predict the conductance of
   dsDNA as it is mechanically stretched to promote various structural
   polymorphisms. We calculate the current along the stretched DNA using a
   combination of molecular dynamics simulations, non-equilibrium pulling
   simulations, quantum mechanics calculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo
   simulations. For 5'end1-5'end2 attachments we find an abrupt jump in the
   current within a very short stretching length (6 angstrom or 17\%)
   leading to a melted DNA state. In contrast, for 3'end1-3'end2 pulling it
   takes almost 32 angstrom (84\%) of stretching to cause a similar jump in
   the current. Thus, we demonstrate that charge transport in DNA can occur
   over stretching lengths of several nanometers. We find that this
   unexpected behaviour in the B to S conformational DNA transition arises
   from highly inclined base pair geometries that result from this pulling
   protocol. We found that the dramatically different conductance behaviors
   for two different pulling protocols arise from how the hydrogen bonds of
   DNA base pairs break.}},

Title = {{OMIP contribution to CMIP6: experimental and diagnostic protocol for the

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP) is an endorsed project in
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). OMIP
   addresses CMIP6 science questions, investigating the origins and
   consequences of systematic model biases. It does so by providing a
   framework for evaluating (including assessment of systematic biases),
   understanding, and improving ocean, sea-ice, tracer, and biogeochemical
   components of climate and earth system models contributing to CMIP6.
   Among the WCRP Grand Challenges in climate science (GCs), OMIP primarily
   contributes to the regional sea level change and near-term
   (climate/decadal) prediction GCs. OMIP provides (a) an experimental
   protocol for global ocean/sea-ice models run with a prescribed
   atmospheric forcing; and (b) a protocol for ocean diagnostics to be
   saved as part of CMIP6. We focus here on the physical component of OMIP,
   with a companion paper (Orr et al., 2016) detailing methods for the
   inert chemistry and interactive biogeochemistry. The physical portion of
   the OMIP experimental protocol follows the interannual Coordinated
   Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II). Since 2009, CORE-I (Normal
   Year Forcing) and CORE-II (Interannual Forcing) have become the standard
   methods to evaluate global ocean/sea-ice simulations and to examine
   mechanisms for forced ocean climate variability. The OMIP diagnostic
   protocol is relevant for any ocean model component of CMIP6, including
   the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima
   experiments), historical simulations, FAFMIP (Flux Anomaly Forced MIP),
   C4MIP (Coupled Carbon Cycle Climate MIP), DAMIP (Detection and
   Attribution MIP), DCPP (Decadal Climate Prediction Project),
   ScenarioMIP, High-ResMIP (High Resolution MIP), as well as the
   ocean/sea-ice OMIP simulations.}},

Title = {{Syndecan-4 enhances PDGF-BB activity in diabetic wound healing}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{56-65}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Non-healing ulcers are a common consequence of long-term diabetes and
   severe peripheral vascular disease. These non-healing wounds are a major
   source of morbidity in patients with diabetes and place a heavy
   financial burden on the healthcare system. Growth factor therapies are
   an attractive strategy for enhancing wound closure in non-healing wounds
   but have only achieved mixed results in clinical trials. Platelet
   derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is the only currently approved growth
   factor therapy for non-healing wounds. However, PDGF-BB therapy is not
   effective in many patients and requires high doses that increase the
   potential for side effects. In this work, we demonstrate that syndecan-4
   delivered in a proteoliposomal formulation enhances PDGF-BB activity in
   diabetic wound healing. In particular, syndecan-4 proteoliposomes
   enhance the migration of keratinocytes derived from patients with
   diabetes. In addition, syndecan-4 proteoliposomes sensitize
   keratinocytes to PDGF-BB stimulation, enhancing the intracellular
   signaling response to PDGF-BB. We further demonstrated that co-therapy
   with syndecan-4 proteoliposomes enhanced wound closure in diabetic,
   hyperlipidemic ob/ob mice. Wounds treated with both syndecan-4
   proteoliposomes and PDGF-BB had increased re-epithelization and
   angiogenesis in comparison to wounds treated with PDGF-BB alone.
   Moreover, the wounds treated with syndecan-4 proteoliposomes and PDGF-BB
   also had increased M2 macrophages and reduced M1 macrophages, suggesting
   syndecan-4 delivery induces immunomodulation within the healing wounds.
   Together our findings support that syndecan-4 proteoliposomes markedly
   improve PDGF-BB efficacy for wound healing and may be useful in
   enhancing treatments for non-healing wounds.
   Statement of Significance
   Non-healing wounds are major healthcare issue for patients with diabetes
   and peripheral vascular disease. Growth factor therapies have potential
   for healing chronic wounds but have not been effective for many
   patients. PDGF-BB is currently the only approved growth factor for
   enhancing wound healing. However, it has not seen widespread adoption
   due to limited efficacy and high cost. In this work, we have developed
   an enhancing agent that improves the activity of PDGF-BB in promoting
   wound healing in animals with diabetes. This co-therapy may be useful in
   improving the efficacy of PDGFBB and enhance its safety through lowering
   the dose of growth factor needed to improve wound healing. (C) 2016 Acta

   One challenge of the estimation of the recovery is to properly model
   complex hydraulic fracture geometries which are often assumed to be
   planar due to the limitation of local grid refinement approach. More
   flexible methods like the use of unstructured grids can significantly
   increase the computational demand. In this study, we introduce an
   efficient methodology of the embedded discrete fracture model to
   explicitly model complex fracture geometries. We build a compositional
   reservoir model to investigate the effects of complex fracture
   geometries on performance of CO2 Huff-n-Puff and CO2 continuous
   injection. The results confirm that the appropriate modelling of the
   fracture geometry plays a critical role in the estimation of the
   incremental oil recovery. This study also provides new insights into the
   understanding of the impacts of CO2 molecular diffusion, reservoir
   permeability, and natural fractures on the performance of CO2-EOR
   processes in tight oil reservoirs.}},

Title = {{Noble gas fractionation during subsurface gas migration}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring of shale gas production and geological carbon
   dioxide (CO2) storage requires identification of subsurface gas sources.
   Noble gases provide a powerful tool to distinguish different sources if
   the modifications of the gas composition during transport can be
   accounted for. Despite the recognition of compositional changes due to
   gas migration in the subsurface, the interpretation of geochemical data
   relies largely on zero-dimensional mixing and fractionation models. Here
   we present two-phase flow column experiments that demonstrate these
   changes. Water containing a dissolved noble gas is displaced by gas
   comprised of CO2 and argon. We observe a characteristic pattern of
   initial co-enrichment of noble gases from both phases in banks at the
   gas front, followed by a depletion of the dissolved noble gas. The
   enrichment of the co-injected noble gas is due to the dissolution of the
   more soluble major gas component, while the enrichment of the dissolved
   noble gas is due to stripping from the groundwater. These processes
   amount to chromatographic separations that occur during two-phase flow
   and can be predicted by the theory of gas injection. This theory
   provides a mechanistic basis for noble gas fractionation during gas
   migration and improves our ability to identify subsurface gas sources
   after post-genetic modification. Finally, we show that compositional
   changes due to two-phase flow can qualitatively explain the spatial
   compositional trends observed within the Bravo Dome natural CO2
   reservoir and some regional compositional trends observed in drinking
   water wells overlying the Marcellus and Barnett shale regions. In both
   cases, only the migration of a gas with constant source composition is
   required, rather than multi-stage mixing and fractionation models
   previously proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cubic Spinel MnCo2O4/graphene sheets (MCO/GS) nanocomposites are
   synthesized by a facile hydro thermal method with a subsequent annealing
   process. Nano-sized MnCo2O4 particles are evenly embedded in paper-like
   graphene sheets, possessing a unique nanoparticles-on-sheets hybrid nano
   structure, with particle size around 20-50 nm. Owing to the special
   nanoparticles-on-sheets structures, MCO/GS nanocomposites have an
   outstanding electrochemical performance for rechargeable energy storage
   devices. As an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, MCO/GS
   electrodes exhibit high reversible discharge capacities (1350.4 mAh
   g(-1) at the initial rate of 100 mA g(-1)), excellent rate capability
   (462.1 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 4000 mA g(-1)) and outstanding
   cycling performance (584.3 mAh at 2000 mA g(-1) after 250 cycles).
   Meanwhile, as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, MCO/GS
   electrodes also exhibit comparably promising electrochemical
   characteristics. Greatly improved electrochemical properties can be
   assigned to the special advantageous nanostructures. Besides, the
   existence of graphene sheets is beneficial to the transportation of
   ions/electrons during battery operation. The outstanding electrochemical
   performance demonstrates that the lithium/sodium storage capability of
   MCO/GS nanocomposites is highly promising for high-capacity batteries.

Title = {{Multiphase isenthalpic flash integrated with stability analysis}},
Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{423}},
Pages = {{203-219}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Isobaric, isenthalpic (PH) flash is challenging for multiphase
   non-isothermal flow simulation using an equation of state (EOS). This is
   because the number of equilibrium phases is unknown in temperature and
   composition space, and because the system of equations in PH flash
   becomes nearly degenerate for narrow-boiling fluids. The term
   ``narrow-boiling{''} is used in the literature to refer to enthalpy that
   is sensitive to temperature.
   The primary objective of this research is to develop the multiphase
   PH-flash algorithm integrated with stability analysis that resolves the
   two technical challenges mentioned above. The secondary objective is to
   present a new analysis of narrow-boiling behavior by coupling energy and
   phase behavior equations through the temperature dependency of K values.
   The thermodynamic model used is the Peng-Robinson EOS with the van der
   Waals mixing rules.
   PH flash in this research is formulated by use of the
   tangent-plane-distance function, in which phase split computation is
   integrated with phase-stability analysis. The formulated PH flash is
   solved by the direct-substitution algorithm with an arbitrary number of
   sampling compositions (N-S), at which phase stability is measured during
   the iteration. The number of equilibrium phases is not required to be
   fixed in the new algorithm.
   Results in case studies show that the new algorithm can robustly handle
   phase appearance/disappearance with narrow-boiling behavior, including
   the case of one degree of freedom. The algorithm becomes more robust
   with increasing N-S because the possibility of finding all stationary
   points of the tangent-plane-distance function increases. However, the
   number of iterations required tends to increase with increasing N-S
   because the algorithm with more sampling compositions may take more
   iterations for merging and adding some of the sampling compositions.
   The general condition presented for narrow-boiling behavior is that the
   interplay between energy balance and phase behavior is significant. Two
   subsets of the condition are derived by analyzing the convex function
   whose gradient vectors consist of the Rachford-Rice equations; (i) the
   overall composition is near an edge of composition space, and (ii) the
   solution conditions (temperature, pressure, and overall composition) are
   near a critical point, including a critical endpoint. A special case of
   the first specific condition is the fluids with one degree of freedom.
   These conditions for narrow-boiling behavior are demonstrated in case
   studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Separation of complex gas mixtures, such as natural gas using polymer
   membranes, often involves components with a wide range of
   condensabilities and propensity to interact with the polymer,
   potentially changing the transport properties of all components. There
   are few studies of such phenomena in the open literature. Here, the
   influence of toluene, a surrogate aromatic contaminant in natural gas,
   on pure and mixed CO2 and CH4 gas transport properties at 35 degrees C
   was investigated for a thermally rearranged (TR) polymer prepared from a
   polyimide precursor based on 3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-bi-phenyl (HAB)
   and 2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxy-phenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride
   (6FDA). As the polymer was exposed to CO2, CH4, and their equimolar
   mixture, at a toluene activity of about 0.3, CO2 and CH4 permeability
   coefficients decreased by more than 90\% relative to their respective
   pre-exposure values due to antiplastization and competitive sorption.
   CO2/CH4 selectivity went through a maximum as toluene activity
   increased, reflecting the interplay between competitive sorption,
   antiplasticization, and plasticization. The recovery of gas permeation
   properties was explored by measuring CO2 and CH4 permeabilities after
   removing toluene from the feed. These effects were largely reversed when
   toluene was removed from the feed gas mixture. Toluene vapor sorption
   was determined as a function of toluene activity, and the sorption data
   were used to help rationalize the changes in CO2 and CH4 gas
   permeability coefficients in the presence of toluene. A qualitative
   assessment of antiplasticization and competitive sorption effects was
   provided using the partial-immobilization dual mode model. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Laboratory membrane fouling studies are often performed with a single
   foulant. However, studies comparing the behavior of different foulants
   using a single membrane are rarely reported. In this study, a
   poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) microfiltration membrane was challenged
   with a series of aqueous based model fouling media, including a
   suspension of latex beads, as well as soybean, motor and crude oil
   emulsions, in constant permeate flux fouling experiments. The critical
   and threshold fluxes were determined for each membrane-foulant pair.
   Constant permeate flux crossflow fouling experiments were performed at
   both low and high fluxes. A direct comparison of the fouling propensity
   of the PVDF membrane to the four fouling media was made. The fouling
   propensity was evaluated based on threshold flux values and the extent
   of transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase during constant permeate flux
   fouling experiments. In this study, the zeta potential of various
   fouling media correlated with their fouling propensities. The higher the
   zeta potential, the lower the fouling propensity. The fouling propensity
   followed the order of: latex beads < soybean oil < crude oil < motor
   oil. A three-stage TMP profile was observed with high fouling media,
   such as motor and crude oil emulsions. The TMP increased slowly in the
   early stage, then increased abruptly, and eventually reached a new
   pseudo-steady state TMP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Structural evaluation provides valuable information about the expected
   behaviour and response of pavements and can be used at the network level
   of pavement management to prioritise projects. The falling weight
   deflectometer (FWD) can be used to identify the beginning and end of
   management sections and group pavement sections with similar structural
   capacities. The structural condition index (SCI) was developed as a
   screening tool for the pavement network-level evaluation, and the FWD
   data are used to determine the SCI. For the successful implementation of
   the SCI concept at the network level, one of the critical issues is the
   accuracy of the index. This article evaluates the accuracy of the SCI
   and also discusses a concept and procedure how to improve the SCI and
   its algorithm for low-volume flexible pavements. A case study (Texas)
   illustrates that the original SCI algorithm underestimates the existing
   structural condition, resulting in overestimated treatments in the
   pavement maintenance and rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Using a chemical potential route, the square-well (SW) fluid model is
   solved in a quasichemical approximation (QCSW). At low temperatures, the
   liquid reaches a limiting density greater than the triple point density
   of a SW fluid but less than the equilibrium liquid-to-solid transition
   density for hard spheres. As this unique density is approached with
   decreasing temperature, the liquid entropy also approaches an asymptotic
   value, thus averting the ``entropy catastrophe{''}. Mean-field models in
   the van der Waals (VDW) genre fail to predict this, type of behavior. In
   VDW models, attractive force contributions to the equation of state
   incorrectly diverge with decreasing temperature as 1/T, whereas those
   for the QCSW model asymptote to a fixed value. The QCSW model posits the
   intuitively pleasing Idea that, at high. densities, attractive
   contributions to the configurational energy begin to saturate well
   before zero temperature is reached. As a consequence, the force balance
   between repulsive and attractive forces stabilizes the liquid density,
   which thereafter becomes effectively independent of temperature. This
   fixed density in turn fixes all other density-dependent thermodynamic
   properties. These low temperature, force-stabilized states are
   identified as glass states.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of PbI2/MAPbI(3) perovskites were prepared and investigated by
   a rapid screening technique utilizing a modified scanning
   electrochemical microscope (SECM) in order to determine how excess PbI2
   affects its photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties. An optimum ratio of
   2.5\% PbI2/MAPbI(3) was found to enhance photocurrent over pristine
   MAPbI(3) on a spot array electrode under irradiation. With bulk films of
   various PbI2/MAPbI(3) composites prepared by a spin-coating technique of
   mixed precursors and a one-step annealing process, the 2.5\%
   PbI2/MAPbI(3) produced an increased photocurrent density compared to
   pristine MAPbI(3) for 2 mM benzoquinone (BQ) reduction at -0.4 V vs
   Fc/Fc(+). As a result of the relatively high quantum yield of MAPbI(3),
   a time-resolved photoluminescence quenching experiment could be applied
   to determine electron hole diffusion coefficients and diffusion lengths
   of PbI2/MAPM(3) composites, respectively. The diffusion coefficients
   combined with the exciton lifetime of the pristine 2.5\% PbI2/MAPbI(3)
   (tau(PL) = 103.3 ns) give the electron and hole exciton diffusion
   lengths, similar to 300 nrn. Thus, the 2.5\% PbI2/MAPbI(3) led to an
   approximately 3.0-fold increase in the diffusion length compared to a
   previous report of similar to 100 nm for the pristine MAPbI(3)
   perovskite. We then demonstrated that the efficiency of liquid-junction
   solar cells for 2.5\% excess PbI2 of p-MAPbI(3) was improved from 6.0\%
   to 7.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic wounds represent a major healthcare and economic problem
   worldwide. Advanced wound dressings that incorporate bioactive compounds
   have great potential for improving outcomes in patients with chronic
   wounds but significant challenges in designing treatments that are
   effective in long-standing, nonhealing wounds. Here, an optimized wound
   healing gel was developed that delivers syndecan-4 proteoliposomes
   (syndesomes) with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) to enhance diabetic
   wound healing. In vitro studies demonstrate that syndesomes markedly
   increase migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts isolated from both
   nondiabetic and diabetic donors. In addition, syndesome treatment leads
   to increased endocytic processing of FGF-2 that includes enhanced
   recycling of FGF-2 to the cell surface after uptake. The optimized
   syndesome formulation was incorporated into an alginate wound dressing
   and tested in a splinted wound model in diabetic, ob/ob mice. It was
   found that wounds treated with syndesomes and FGF-2 have markedly
   enhanced wound closure in comparison to wounds treated with only FGF-2.
   Moreover, syndesomes have an immunomodulatory effect on wound
   macrophages, leading to a shift toward the M2 macrophage phenotype and
   alterations in the wound cytokine profile. Together, these studies show
   that delivery of exogenous syndecan-4 is an effective method for
   enhancing wound healing in the long-term diabetic diseased state.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is regarded as a nonexhaustive
   sampling technique with a smaller extraction volume and a shorter
   extraction time than traditional sampling techniques and is hence widely
   used. The SPME sampling process is affected by the convection or
   diffusion effect along the coating surface, but this factor has seldom
   been studied. This paper derives an analytical model to characterize
   SPME sampling for semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) as well as for
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by considering the surface mass
   transfer process. Using this model, the chemical concentrations in a
   sample matrix can be conveniently calculated. In addition, the model can
   be used to determine the characteristic parameters (partition
   coefficient and diffusion coefficient) for typical SPME chemical
   samplings (SPME calibration). Experiments using SPME samplings of two
   typical SVOCs, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in sealed chamber and
   di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in ventilated chamber, were performed
   to measure the two characteristic parameters. The experimental results
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the model and calibration method.
   Experimental data from the literature (VOCs sampled by SPME) were used
   to further validate the model. This study should prove useful for
   relatively rapid quantification of concentrations of different chemicals
   in various circumstances with SPME.}},

Abstract = {{Stepping on coronally-uneven and unpredictable terrain is a common gait
   disturbance that can lead to injurious falls. This study identified the
   biomechanical response to a step on coronally-uneven and unpredictable
   terrain through observation of participants traversing a walkway with a
   middle step that could be blinded to participants, and positioned either
   15 inverted, 15 everted, or flush. The isolated disturbance was intended
   to simulate stepping on a rock, object, or other transient coronal
   disturbance and allow for observation of the subsequent balance
   recovery. Gait balance was affected by the disturbance, and was measured
   by the range of coronal whole-body angular momentum, which compared to
   unblinded flush, increased during blinded eversion, and decreased during
   blinded inversion. Analysis of external coronal moments applied to the
   body about the center-of-mass by the disturbed and recovery legs
   suggested the disturbed leg contributed more to differences in the range
   of coronal angular momentum, and thus more to balance recovery. The
   stepping strategy for the disturbed and recovery steps was measured by
   mediolateral foot position, and appeared to have been mostly affected by
   anticipatory actions taken by participants before stepping on the
   blinded terrain, and not by the terrain angle. In contrast, on the
   disturbed step, distinct differences between blinded inversion and
   eversion in the coronal moments of the hip and ankle suggested the hip
   and ankle joint moment strategies were important for adapting to the
   terrain angle. A clinical implication of this result was interventions
   that augment these moments may improve gait balance control on
   coronally-uneven and unpredictable terrain. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{The regulation of whole-body angular momentum is important for
   maintaining dynamic balance during human walking, which is particularly
   challenging in the frontal plane. Whole-body angular momentum is
   actively regulated by individual muscle forces. Thus, understanding
   which muscles contribute to frontal plane angular momentum will further
   our understanding of mediolateral balance control and has the potential
   to help diagnose and treat balance disorders. The purpose of this study
   was to identify how individual muscles and gravity contribute to
   whole-body angular momentum in the frontal plane using a muscle-actuated
   forward dynamics simulation analysis. A three-dimensional simulation was
   developed that emulated the average walking mechanics of a group of
   young healthy adults (n=10). The results showed that a finite set of
   muscles are the primary contributors to frontal plane balance and that
   these contributions vary throughout the gait cycle. In early stance, the
   vasti, adductor magnus and gravity acted to rotate the body towards the
   contralateral leg while the gluteus medius acted to rotate the body
   towards the ipsilateral leg. In late stance, the gluteus medius
   continued to rotate the body towards the ipsilateral leg while the
   soleus and gastrocnemius acted to rotate the body towards the
   contralateral leg. These results highlight those muscles that are
   critical to maintaining dynamic balance in the frontal plane during
   walking and may provide targets for locomotor therapies aimed at
   treating balance disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the role of individual ingredients of hot mix asphalt (HMA)
   such as asphalt binder and aggregates on its performance is readily
   recognized, there is only limited understanding about the interactions
   between these components and the properties of binder-aggregate
   interface. In order to study the interactions between asphalt binder and
   mineral aggregates, an interfacial test method was developed and its
   effectiveness was evaluated. Interfacial interactions were evaluated by
   testing thin films of an asphalt binder interfaced with the surface of
   aggregates under two different modes of loading in shear: sinusoidal
   oscillation and monotonically increasing. An Interaction Parameter (IP)
   was proposed to quantify the binder-aggregate interfacial effects. The
   results show that the methodology used in this study can quantify the
   effects of interaction between the asphalt binder and mineral
   aggregates. Furthermore, this research also investigated the interaction
   of an asphalt binder with the surface of simulated reclaimed asphalt
   pavement (RAP) aggregates. The results from this research not only
   provide an insight to the effects of binder-aggregate interaction, but
   can also help practitioners to better understand the effect of mixing
   conditions on the properties of mixtures produced using different
   materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results for CAPRI Round 30, the first joint CASP-CAPRI
   experiment, which brought together experts from the protein structure
   prediction and protein-protein docking communities. The Round comprised
   25 targets from amongst those submitted for the CASP11 prediction
   experiment of 2014. The targets included mostly homodimers, a few
   homo-tetramers, and two heterodimers, and comprised protein chains that
   could readily be modeled using templates from the Protein Data Bank. On
   average 24 CAPRI groups and 7 CASP groups submitted docking predictions
   for each target, and 12 CAPRI groups per target participated in the
   CAPRI scoring experiment. In total more than 9500 models were assessed
   against the 3D structures of the corresponding target complexes. Results
   show that the prediction of homodimer assemblies by homology modeling
   techniques and docking calculations is quite successful for targets
   featuring large enough subunit interfaces to represent stable
   associations. Targets with ambiguous or inaccurate oligomeric state
   assignments, often featuring crystal contact-sized interfaces,
   represented a confounding factor. For those, a much poorer prediction
   performance was achieved, while nonetheless often providing helpful
   clues on the correct oligomeric state of the protein. The prediction
   performance was very poor for genuine tetrameric targets, where the
   inaccuracy of the homology-built subunit models and the smaller
   pair-wise interfaces severely limited the ability to derive the correct
   assembly mode. Our analysis also shows that docking procedures tend to
   perform better than standard homology modeling techniques and that
   highly accurate models of the protein components are not always required
   to identify their association modes with acceptable accuracy. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We report on the effects of mechanical distortion and gate
   insulator-semiconductor interface modification on the electronic
   transport characteristics of inkjet printed short channel length single
   walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) transistors with Al2O3 top gate
   insulators. In these transistors, which are typically ambipolar, the
   average nanotube length is greater than the source-drain (S/D) spacing
   resulting in individual SWCNTs spanning the entire channel length.
   Mechanical distortion of the nanotubes due to bending near source and
   drain contacts when they are not recessed is found to suppress electron
   transport and transform the ambipolar transistors into p-type devices.
   Inclusion of printed interfacial polymer layers such as poly(vinylidene
   fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) between the SWCNTs and Al2O3
   also results in p-type doping and reductions in electron transport. We
   discuss mechanisms responsible for these effects.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A residential hybrid ground source heat pump (HGSHP) model is presented,
   which integrates a compact cooling tower with a GSHP. The base case GSHP
   model is for a single story, 195 m(2) house with a 14 kW heat pump and
   four 68.8m deep vertical boreholes and uses Austin, TX weather data. The
   GSHP model was run for a range of supplemental heat rejection (SHR)
   capacities of an unidentified device located between the heat pump
   outlet and ground loop inlet, and estimates of improved heat pump
   performance and ground temperature effects are presented. Then, a
   compact closed wet cooling tower (CWCT) model is presented and coupled
   to the GSHP model. The tower's 7 kW capacity represents the smallest
   commercially available cooling tower. Each of the four HGSHP boreholes
   was reduced to 26.5 m. The operational and economic performance of the
   HGSHP is compared to a GSHP alone. Metrics include estimates of initial
   and lifetime operational costs, ground temperature effects, and heat
   pump efficiency. Simulations for ten years of operation show that adding
   the compact CWCT is cost effective, extends the lifetime of the borehole
   system, and maintains high heat pump efficiencies.}},

Pages = {{R307-R323}},

Abstract = {{Full-waveform inversion (FWI) enables us to obtain high-resolution
   subsurface images; however, estimating model uncertainties associated
   with this technique is still a challenging problem. We have used a
   Bayesian inference framework to estimate model uncertainties associated
   with FWI. The uncertainties were assessed based on an a posteriori
   covariance operator, evaluated at the maximum a posteriori model. For
   the prior distribution, we have used a spatially nonstationary
   covariance operator based on a plane-wave construction with local dips
   measured from migrated images. Preconditioned frequency-domain FWI was
   used to estimate the maximum a posteriori model. Efficient manipulation
   of the posterior covariance was based on a low-rank approximation of the
   data misfit Hessian preconditioned by the prior covariance operator. The
   strong decay of the singular values indicated that data were mostly
   informative about a low-dimensional subspace of model parameters. To
   reduce computational cost of the randomized singular value
   decomposition, we have used a Hessian approximation based on
   point-spread functions. The 2D numerical examples with synthetic data
   confirmed that the method can effectively estimate uncertainties for
   FWI. Visual comparisons of random samples drawn from the prior and
   posterior distributions have allowed us to evaluate model uncertainties.
   Furthermore, we found out how statistical quantities, such as means and
   pointwise standard deviation fields, can be efficiently extracted from
   the prior and posterior distributions. These fields helped us to
   objectively assess subsurface images provided by FWI.}},

   quantitative corrosion damage monitoring of cylindrical structures. The
   approach consists of two stages. First a multi helical ultrasonic
   imaging (MHUI) algorithm is used to provide qualitative images of the

   to obtain quantitative damage information, such as thickness map.
   Experimental tests are carried out on a steel pipe instrumented with six
   piezoelectric transducers to validate the proposed approach. Three
   thickness recesses are considered to simulate corrosion damage. The
   results show the efficiency of the proposed approach for quantifying
   corrosion location, area and remnant thickness.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the need to make frequent changes in operating suites, this
   paper presents a highly scalable and efficient solution framework for
   scheduling nurses in operating suites over the day. This framework
   consists of two core optimization models that are necessary for
   scheduling OR nurses in the clinic. The first model addresses the
   multi-objective optimization problem of assigning nurses to upcoming
   surgery cases based on their specialties and competency levels. The
   second model is designed to generate lunch break assignments for the
   nurses once their caseloads are determined. The latter problem has been
   largely overlooked by the research community despite its importance.
   Because the multi-objective model is too large to solve using commercial
   software, we developed both a column generation algorithm and a
   two-phase swapping heuristic to find feasible assignments in a fast
   manner. For both approaches, initial solutions are obtained with a
   restricted model and lunch breaks are scheduled in a post-processing
   step. Experiments were conducted to determine the value of the models
   and the performance of the algorithms using real data provided by MD
   Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. The results show that the two
   approaches can produce implementable daily schedules in a matter of
   minutes for instances with over 100 nurses, 50 surgery cases and 33
   operating rooms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Optical metamaterials have redefined how we understand light in notable
   ways: from strong response to optical magnetic fields, negative
   refraction, fast and slow light propagation in zero index and trapping
   structures, to flat, thin and perfect lenses. Many rules of thumb
   regarding optics, such as mu = 1, now have an exception, and basic
   formulas, such as the Fresnel equations, have been expanded. The field
   of metamaterials has developed strongly over the past two decades.
   Leveraging structured materials systems to generate tailored response to
   a stimulus, it has grown to encompass research in optics,
   electromagnetics, acoustics and, increasingly, novel hybrid material
   responses. This roadmap is an effort to present emerging fronts in areas
   of optical metamaterials that could contribute and apply to other
   research communities. By anchoring each contribution in current work and
   prospectively discussing future potential and directions, the authors
   are translating the work of the field in selected areas to a wider
   community and offering an incentive for outside researchers to engage
   our community where solid links do not already exist.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of CO2 Low Salinity Water-Alternating-Gas for enhanced oil

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Low Salinity Waterflooding (LSW) is an emerging attractive enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR) method because of its oil recovery performance and
   relatively simple, environmentally friendly implementation, when
   compared with conventional high salinity waterflooding and EOR
   approaches. More importantly, another advantage of LSW is that it can be
   integrated with other EOR methods (in hybrid LSW processes), i.e.
   chemical or miscible gas flooding. The merits of combining LSW with CO2
   injection is investigated in this paper, and a novel EOR method, Low
   Salinity Water Alternating CO2 (CO2 LSWAG), is proposed. CO2 LSWAG
   injection promotes the synergy of the mechanisms underlying these
   methods which further enhances oil recovery and overcomes the late
   production problems frequently encountered in conventional WAG. CO2
   LSWAG has been evaluated in both one-dimensional and full-field scale
   with positive results compared with conventional high salinity WAG.
   To investigate the advantages of CO2 LSWAG, a comprehensive ion exchange
   model associated with geochemical processes has been implemented and
   coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow equations in an
   equation-of-state compositional simulator. 1D simulation of different
   CO2 LSWAG schemes are first conducted to understand the combined effects
   of solubility of CO2 in brine, dissolution of carbonate minerals, ion
   exchange, and wettability alteration. CO2 LSWAG performance is then
   evaluated on a field scale through an integrated workflow that includes
   geological modeling, multi-phase multi component reservoir flow modeling
   and process optimization. The simulation results indicate that CO2 LSWAG
   has the highest oil recovery compared to conventional high salinity
   waterflood, high salinity WAG, continuous CO2 flooding, and low salinity
   waterflood. A number of geological realizations are generated to assess
   the geological uncertainty effect, in particular clay distribution
   uncertainties, on CO2 LSWAG efficiency. CO2 LSWAG injection strategies
   are optimized by identifying key WAG parameters. Finally, CO2 LSWAG is
   evaluated in the full field scale for a North Sea reservoir and the
   simulation results shows that CO2 LSWAG yields about 4.5\% incremental
   OOIP compared to the conventional high salinity WAG.
   The proposed workflow demonstrates the synergy between CO2 WAG and LSW.
   Built in a robust reservoir simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for
   screening, design, optimization, and uncertainty assessment of the
   process. CO2 LSWAG is a promising EOR technique as it not only combines
   the benefits of CO2 injection and low salinity water floods but also
   promotes the synergy between these processes through the interactions
   between geochemical reactions associated with CO2 injection, ion
   exchange process, and wettability alteration. This paper demonstrates
   the merits of this process through modeling, optimization and
   uncertainty assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical specific energy (MSE) has been widely used to quantify
   drilling efficiency and maximize rate of penetration (ROP) in oil and
   gas wells drilling. Given currently there are few effective MSE models
   to precisely model the actual downhole drilling for rotating drilling
   with positive displacement motor (PDM), in this work a new MSE model for
   rotating drilling with PDM is established based on the analysis of PDM
   performance. Meanwhile a method for real time optimization of drilling
   parameters based on MSE for rotating drilling with PDM in the hard
   formation is also presented. Field data presented in this paper indicate
   that when drilling with a high efficiency and free of drilling
   complications, the MSE(min) estimated by the new MSE model is roughly
   equal to the confined compressive strength (CCS) of the formation along
   the well depth, it can meet the needs of applications in the field. It
   also shows that ROP is sensitive to high weight on bit (WOB) for
   rotating drilling with PDM and the optimum WOB is low, increasing WOB
   does not always increase ROP but is more likely to decrease ROP. The
   method for optimizing drilling parameters can real time estimate optimum
   WOB values with different RPM to drill a specific formation interval
   with PDM. It can be used to maximize ROP and allow operators to drill
   longer and avoid unnecessary trips. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have experimentally studied the impact of particle
   size distribution (PSD) on the fracture sealing capability of lost
   circulation material (LCM) blends. Our primary aim was to determine the
   PSD which maximizes the Wellbore Strengthening (WBS) benefits obtained
   from fracture sealing. High-pressure borehole fracturing experiments
   were conducted on Berea sandstone samples under atmospheric pore
   pressure and various confining pressures to investigate the WBS effects
   of several LCM blends. Post-fracturing methods such as Computerized
   Axial Tomography (CAT) scan and thin-section imaging were used to
   investigate the geometry of induced fractures and formed seals within
   them. Based on the conducted experiments and post-fracturing analyses,
   we have evaluated and re-assessed well-known theories applicable to the
   design of LCM blends, such as the one-third rule, the ideal packing
   theory, and the Vickers criteria. Our experiments indicate that for any
   rock with a given set of rock strength and failure parameters, there
   exists an optimum PSD to maximize WBS benefits. Optimum PSD appears to
   be of primary importance, almost independent of LCM type. In addition,
   we have shown that the optimum PSD should have a bimodal structure, with
   sufficient concentrations of properly sized fine and coarse particles.
   Although the one-third rule, the ideal packing theory, and the Vickers
   criteria may provide some basic PSD guidelines, these theories are
   mainly empirical relationships based on conventional particle plugging
   experiments. As shown here, they do not properly represent the physics
   of fracture sealing. To remedy this situation, we are introducing a new
   family of design curves for optimum PSD, based on the underlying physics
   of fracture sealing observed in the WBS experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is commonly used in all types of
   reinforced concrete construction. The use of SCC mixtures allows for
   simpler, more cost-effective fabrication techniques and provides the
   ability to cast structural shapes and architectural finishes that were

   numerous research efforts in looking at mixtures, rheological
   properties, hardened properties, and integration into structural
   systems. Research reported in this paper is aimed at contributing to a
   better understanding of the major concerns with regard to the use of SCC
   concrete in pretensioned bridge girders: 1) end region cracking; 2)
   long-term deformations; and 3) ultimate strength performance. The work
   conducted in this research highlighted the impact of the stiffness of
   SCC mixtures (compared to conventional concrete {[}CC] mixtures) on both

Abstract = {{Many bridges are handling heavier loads than those expected at design
   and require strengthening of existing members or repairing damaged
   members. Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials have been used
   successfully to strengthen reinforced concrete structures. Most studies
   have focused on unidirectional layout of CFRP strips in high shear
   regions of beams. Recent shear tests on full-scale I-girders have shown
   that the use of bidirectional CFRP layouts with CFRP anchors led to much
   higher shear strength increases than when using unidirectional layouts.
   Small-scale panel tests have been conducted to investigate parameters
   that influence the performance of bidirectional CFRP layouts. Panels
   were tested under compressive forces that resemble compression struts
   that develop in the webs of I-beams. The panels were tested to
   investigate a number of parameters in a more efficient manner than
   testing full-scale girders. The panel tests provide qualitative
   comparisons between the influences of the parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the Rayleigh wavemodel
   (RWM) in combination with optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique
   to assess the viscoelasticity of soft tissues. Dispersion curves
   calculated from the spectral decomposition of OCE-measured air-pulse
   induced elastic waves were used to quantify the viscoelasticity of
   samples using the RWM. Validation studies were first conducted on 10\%
   gelatin phantoms with different concentrations of oil. The results
   showed that the oil increased the viscosity of the gelatin phantom
   samples. This method was then used to quantify the viscoelasticity of
   chicken liver. The Young's modulus of the chicken liver tissues was
   estimated as E = 2.04 +/- 0.88 kPa with a shear viscosity. eta = 1.20
   +/- 0.13 Pa s. The analytical solution of the RWM correlated very well
   with the OCE-measured phased velocities (R-2 = 0.96 +/- 0.04). The
   results show that the combination of the RWM and OCE is a promising
   method for noninvasively quantifying the biomechanical properties of
   soft tissues and may be a useful tool for detecting disease. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{To improve the accuracy of fringe projection profilometry for a single
   deformed pattern, an instantaneous phase retrieval method is proposed
   using a wavelet ridge section and an adaptive bandpass filter based on
   dyadic wavelets. First, we present a concept and assumption named
   wavelet ridge section to depict the instantaneous phases of the deformed
   fringe signals, which are also degraded by noise, and then introduce a
   formula to calculate the width of the wavelet ridge section.
   Furthermore, an adaptive bandpass filter is designed for extracting the
   wavelet subsignals corresponding to the wavelet ridge sections to
   reconstruct the analytical signal. Finally, the instantaneous phase of
   the distorted fringe pattern is effectively retrieved. All parameters of
   our method are designed to be adaptive for different fringe patterns.
   Our experiments indicate that the proposed method is effective for
   measurements and outperforms other existing mainstream wavelet transform
   profilometry techniques, not only in accuracy but also in noise
   suppression performance. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical

Title = {{Numerical investigation of a novel hypothesis for fracture termination
   and crossing, with applications to lost circulation mitigation and
   hydraulic fracturing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We investigate a novel hypothesis regarding the process of hydraulic
   fracture termination against a preexisting frictional interface.
   According to current understanding, crossing occurs when small tensile
   fractures form ahead of the crack tip, on the other side of the
   frictional interface, before the concentration of stress at the crack
   tip causes slip along the interface. Slip blunts the concentration of
   stress at the crack tip and causes termination. Existing crossing
   criteria assume that the incipient fractures ahead of the crack tip form
   instantaneously once the effective stress is sufficiently tensile.
   However, there is a poroelastic response that causes a reduction in
   pressure in response to opening. This is counteracted by flow into the
   crack from the surrounding matrix. In very low matrix permeability
   formations (shale, coalbed methane, etc.), flow of fluid inward from the
   matrix is slow, and the opening of these incipient fractures may require
   a non-negligible amount of time. Using the hydro-mechanical discrete
   fracture network simulator CFRAC, we performed a series of numerical
   simulations to qualitatively investigate this process. The simulations
   confirm that poroelastic response could affect incipient fracture
   initiation and hydraulic fracture crossing. Based on this mechanism, we
   developed a heuristic modification to an existing crossing criterion. We
   applied the new criterion to investigate an injection sequence for
   prevention of lost circulation in fractured, low matrix permeability
   formations. Lost circulation occurs if wellbore fluid pressure exceeds
   the minimum principal stress, causing fluid loss due to propagation of a
   hydraulic fracture. In our proposed injection sequence: (1) injection is
   performed at high rate to create near wellbore fracture network
   complexity and then (2) viscous fluid is injected into the newly formed
   fractures to create resistance to flow. The simulations show that this
   sequence may be able to mitigate lost circulation and create a stress
   cage around the wellbore. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of lignocellulosic sugars, in particular xylose, is
   important for sustainable fuels and chemicals production. While the
   oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a strong candidate for lipid
   production, it is currently unable to effectively utilize xylose. By
   introducing a heterologous oxidoreductase pathway and enabling
   starvation adaptation, we obtained a Y. lipolytica strain, E26 XUS, that
   can use xylose as a sole carbon source and produce over 15 g/L of lipid
   in bioreactor fermentations (29.3\% of theoretical yield) with a maximal
   lipid productivity of 0.19 g/L/h. Genomic sequencing and genetic
   analysis pointed toward increases in genomic copy number of the pathway
   and resulting elevated expression levels as the causative mutations
   underlying this improved phenotype. More broadly, many regions of the
   genome were duplicated during starvation of Yarrowia. This strain can
   form the basis for further engineering to enhance xylose catabolic rates
   and conversion. Finally, this study also reveals the flexibility and
   dynamic nature of the Y. lipolytica genome, and the means at which
   starvation can be used to induce genomic duplications.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the time-dependent scaling of chemical weathering has been
   a significant research goal for over a decade. A percolation theoretical
   treatment of nonreactive solute transport that was previously shown
   compatible with the scaling of chemical weathering rates is here shown
   to be compatible with soil formation rates, and with C and N
   sequestration rates in the soil as well. In this theoretical framework,
   the percolation backbone fractal dimensionality, which generates the
   long-time tail of the solute arrival time distribution, also predicts
   the scaling of the reaction rates, while laboratory proportionality to
   the fluid flow velocity translates to an analogous relevance of the
   vertical infiltration rate in the field. The predicted proportionality
   of solute transport to net infiltration generates simultaneously the
   variability in soil formation rates across 4 orders of magnitude of
   precipitation and 12 orders of magnitude of time scales.}},

Abstract = {{We report the improvement of the electrical performance of field effect
   transistors (FETs) fabricated on monolayer chemical vapor deposited
   (CVD) MoS2, by applying an interacting fluoropolymer capping layer
   (Teflon-AF). The electrical characterizations of more than 60 FETs,
   after applying Teflon-AF cap, show significant improvement of the device
   properties and reduced device to device variation. The improvement
   includes: 50\% reduction of the average gate hysteresis, 30\% reduction
   of the subthreshold swing and about an order of magnitude increase of
   the current on-off ratio. These favorable changes in device performance
   are attributed to the reduced exposure of MoS2 channels to the
   adsorbates in the ambient which can be explained by the polar nature of
   Teflon-AF cap. A positive shift in the threshold voltage of all the
   measured FETs is observed, which translates to the more desirable

Title = {{Particle-Based Modeling of Living Actin Filaments in an Optical Trap}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We report a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation study of a
   bundle of parallel actin filaments under supercritical conditions
   pressing against a loaded mobile wall using a particle-based approach
   where each particle represents an actin unit. The filaments are grafted
   to a fixed wall at one end and are reactive at the other end, where they
   can perform single monomer (de) polymerization steps and push on a
   mobile obstacle. We simulate a reactive grand canonical ensemble in a
   box of fixed transverse area A, with a fixed number of grafted filaments
   Nf, at temperature T and monomer chemical potential m 1. For a single
   filament case (Nf = 1) and for a bundle of Nf = 8 filaments, we analyze
   the structural and dynamical properties at equilibrium where the
   external load compensates the average force exerted by the bundle. The
   dynamics of the bundle-moving-wall unit are characteristic of an
   over-damped Brownian oscillator in agreement with recent in vitro
   experiments by an optical trap setup. We analyze the influence of the
   pressing wall on the kinetic rates of (de) polymerization events for the
   filaments. Both static and dynamic results compare reasonably well with
   recent theoretical treatments of the same system. Thus, we consider the
   proposed model as a good tool to investigate the properties of a bundle
   of living filaments.}},

Title = {{Body image and quality of life of breast cancer patients: influence of

Journal = {{PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The process of cancer-related breast reconstruction is
   typically multi-staged and can take months to years to complete, yet few
   studies have examined patient psychosocial well-being during the
   reconstruction process. We investigated the effects of reconstruction
   timing and reconstruction stage on body image and quality of life at
   specific time points during the breast reconstruction process.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 216 patients were grouped into
   four reconstructive stages: pre-reconstruction, completed stage 1,
   completed stage 2, and final stages. Multiple regression analyses
   examined the roles of reconstruction timing (immediate vs delayed
   reconstruction) and reconstruction stage as well as their interaction in
   predicting body image and quality of life, controlling for patient age,
   BMI, type of reconstruction, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and major
   complication(s).
   Results: A difference in pattern of body image was observed across the
   reconstructive stages, with those receiving delayed reconstruction
   showing significant decrease in body image dissatisfaction compared with
   those with immediate reconstruction. At pre-reconstruction, patients
   awaiting delayed reconstruction reported significantly lower social
   well-being compared with those awaiting immediate reconstruction.
   Reconstruction stage predicted emotional well-being, with higher
   emotional well-being observed in those who had commenced reconstruction.
   Conclusions: Timing and stage of reconstruction are important to
   consider when examining psychosocial outcomes of breast cancer patients
   undergoing reconstruction. Those waiting to initiate delayed
   reconstruction appear at particular risk for body image, emotional, and
   social distress. Our findings have implications for delivery of
   psychosocial treatment to maximize body image and quality of life of
   patients undergoing cancer-related breast reconstruction. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The potential leakage of hydrocarbon fluids or carbon dioxide (CO2) out
   of subsurface formations through wells with fractured cement or debonded
   microannuli is a primary concern in oil-andgas production and CO2
   storage. The presence of fractures in a cement annulus with apertures on
   the order of 10-300 mm can pose a significant leakage danger with
   effective permeability in the range of 0.1-1.0 md. Leakage pathways with
   small apertures are often difficult for conventional oilfield cement to
   repair; thus, a low-viscosity sealant that can be placed into these
   fractures easily while providing a long-term robust seal is desired. The
   development of a novel application with pH-triggered polymeric sealants
   could potentially be the solution to plugging these fractures.
   The application is based on the transport and reaction of a low-pH
   poly(acrylic acid) polymer through fractures in strongly alkaline
   cement. The pH-sensitive microgels viscosify after neutralization with
   cement to become highly swollen gels with substantial yield stress that
   can block fluid flow. Experiments in a cement fracture determined the
   effects of the viscosification and gel deposition with real-time visual
   observation and measurements of pressure gradient and effluent pH.
   Although the pH-triggered gelling mechanism and rheology measurements of
   the polymer gel show promising results, the polymer solution undergoes a
   reaction caused by the release of calcium cations from cement that
   collapses the polymer network (syneresis). It produces an undesirable
   calcium-precipitation byproduct that is detrimental to the strength and
   stability of the gel in place. As a result, gel-sealed leakage pathways
   that were subjected to various degrees of syneresis often failed to hold
   backpressures.
   Multiple chemicals were tested for pretreatment of cement cores to
   remove calcium from the cement surface zone to inhibit syneresis during
   polymer placement. A chelating agent, sodium triphosphate (Na5P3O10),
   was found to successfully eliminate syneresis without compromising the
   injectivity of polymer solution during placement. Polymer-gel strength
   is determined by recording the maximum-holdback pressure gradients
   during liquid-breakthrough tests after various periods of pretreatment
   and polymer shut-in time. Cores pretreated with Na5P3O10 successfully
   held up to an average of 70 psi/ft, which is significantly greater than
   the range of pressure gradients expected in CO2-storage applications.
   The use of such inexpensive, pH-triggered polyacrylic acid polymer
   allows the sealing of leakage pathways effectively under high-pH

Abstract = {{The spatial temperature distribution in the highly energy-intensive
   furnace unit in a steam reforming-based hydrogen manufacturing plant
   determines the energy efficiency of the plant. While the fuel
   distribution among the burners can be manipulated to control the furnace
   temperature distribution, adequate temperature measurements is a
   prerequisite. Typical furnaces have hundreds of tubes and burners, and
   economic considerations dictate that the number of temperature sensors
   and flow actuators required for automatic temperature optimization be
   minimized. In this article, we investigate several formulations for the
   design of the optimal sensor and actuation configurations for an
   industrial furnace. We initially formulate the optimal sensor placement
   problem as a bi-level optimization problem, and exploit the problem
   structure to obtain an equivalent mixed-integer linear program
   formulation. We then provide an extension to the combined sensor and
   actuator placement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through
   simulation case studies based on industrial data. (C) 2016 American

Title = {{Unobserved heterogeneity and the statistical analysis of highway
   accident data}},
Journal = {{ANALYTIC METHODS IN ACCIDENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Highway accidents are complex events that involve a variety of human
   responses to external stimuli, as well as complex interactions between
   the vehicle, roadway features/ condition, traffic-related factors, and
   environmental conditions. In addition, there are complexities involved
   in energy dissipation (once an accident has occurred) that relate to
   vehicle design, impact angles, the physiological characteristics of
   involved humans, and other factors. With such a complex process, it is
   impossible to have access to all of the data that could potentially
   determine the likelihood of a highway accident or its resulting injury
   severity. The absence of such important data can potentially present
   serious specification problems for traditional statistical analyses that
   can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates, erroneous
   inferences and erroneous accident predictions. This paper presents a
   detailed discussion of this problem (typically referred to as unobserved
   heterogeneity) in the context of accident data and analysis. Various
   statistical approaches available to address this unobserved
   heterogeneity are presented along with their strengths and weaknesses.
   The paper concludes with a summary of the fundamental issues and
   directions for future methodological work that addresses unobserved
   heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{138-147}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Torpedo anchors are used for station keeping of floating offshore
   platforms and fixing risers to the seabed in deep water. Their main
   benefit over other anchors is reduction in anchor installation cost via
   free falling in the water. A torpedo anchor has a steel cylindrical
   shaft with a conical tip and is ballasted in order to deepen the soil
   penetration and increase the anchor holding capacity. In order to
   address the installation effects on the soil strength and consequently
   the anchor pull-out capacity, first reconsolidation (set-up) of soil
   next to the anchor after installation is studied by a finite-element
   (FE) analysis of coupled deformation and fluid flow in porous media. The
   results of the set-up analysis indicate the rate of dissipation of
   excess pore-water pressure and soil-strength recovery. These are
   important considerations in predicting the anchor pull-out capacity at
   different times after installation. In the absence of a documented
   complete set Of installation and set-up tests, the results are validated
   qualitatively using available albeit limited field test data. (C) 2016

Title = {{Cell labeling and proximity dependent biotinylation with engineered
   monomeric streptavidin}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{152-158}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Because streptavidin is a homotetramer, it can bind multiple
   biotinylated ligands and cause target aggregation. To allow biotin
   detection without clustering, we previously engineered monomeric
   streptavidin (mSA) that is structurally similar to a single streptavidin
   subunit. Introducing the S25H mutation near the binding site increases
   the biotin dissociation half-life t(1/2) to 83 minutes. The slowly
   dissociating mutant, mSA2, is useful in imaging studies because it
   allows stable labeling of biotinylated targets. We show that mSA2
   conjugated with Alexa 488 binds biotinylated receptors on HEK293 with
   high specificity, and bound mSA2-Alexa488 does not dissociate
   significantly during an imaging study lasting 50 minutes. As a
   structural monomer, mSA2 can be fused to other proteins to create
   bifunctional molecules. We tested the use of mSA2 in proximity dependent
   biotinylation, in which mSA2 is fused to a peptide or a protein that
   binds a protein of interest (POI) and is used to recruit
   photoactivatable biotin (PA-biotin) to the target molecule. Once the
   resulting cluster of interacting proteins is subjected to UV-initiated
   distance-dependent biotinylation, subsequent affinity purification of
   biotinylated proteins on streptavidin beads can identify protein
   molecules that interact with POI. In addition to proteins that directly
   interact with the mSA2 fusion, mSA2 also induces biotinylation of other
   proteins that are associated through a series of noncovalent
   interactions. We show that mSA2 fused to an antibody recognition domain
   can be recruited to the kinase Erk-2 using a commercially available
   antibody and induce biotinylation of a known Erk-2 substrate, GST-Elk-1.
   Therefore, mSA2 can be used to implement proximity dependent
   biotinylation and detect transient enzyme-substrate interactions.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Nanophotonic engineering holds great promise for photovoltaics, with
   several recently proposed approaches that have enabled efficiencies
   close to the Shockley-Queisser limit. Here, we theoretically demonstrate
   that suitably designed nanophotonic structures may be able to surpass
   the 1 sun Shockley-Queisser limit by utilizing tailored directivity of
   the scattering response of nanoparticles. We show that large absorption
   cross sections do not play a significant role in the efficiency
   enhancement, and on the contrary, directivity enhancement constitutes
   the nanoscale equivalent to concentration in macroscopic photovoltaic
   systems. Based on this principle, we discuss fundamental limits to the
   efficiency based on directivity bounds and a number of approaches to get
   dose to these limits. We also highlight that, in practice, achieving
   efficiencies above the Shockley-Queisser limit is strongly hindered by
   whether high short-circuit currents can be maintained. Finally, we
   discuss how our results are affected by the presence of significant
   nonradiative recombination, in which case both directivity and photon
   escape probability should be increased to achieve voltage enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{The large-scale conformation of DNA molecules plays a critical role in
   many basic elements of cellular functionality and viability. By
   targeting the structural properties of DNA, many cancer drugs, such as
   anthracyclines, effectively inhibit tumor growth but can also produce
   dangerous side effects. To enhance the development of innovative
   medications, rapid screening of structural changes to DNA can provide
   important insight into their mechanism of interaction. In this study, we
   report changes to circular DNA conformation from intercalation with
   ethidium bromide using all -atom molecular dynamics simulations and
   characterized experimentally by translocation through a silicon nitride
   solid-state nanopore. Our measurements reveal three distinct current
   blockade levels and a 6 -fold increase in translocation times for
   ethidium bromide -treated circular DNA as compared to untreated circular
   DNA. We attribute these increases to changes in the supercoiled
   configuration hypothesized to be branched or looped structures formed in
   the circular DNA molecule. Further evidence of the conformational
   changes is demonstrated by qualitative atomic force microscopy analysis.
   These results expand the current methodology for predicting and
   characterizing DNA tertiary structure and advance nanopore technology as
   a platform for deciphering structural changes of other important
   biomolecules.}},

Title = {{Optimal policies in cities with congestion and agglomeration

   strategies}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a spatial general equilibrium model that
   accommodates both congestion and agglomeration externalities, while
   firms' and households' land-use decisions are endogenous across
   continuous space. Focusing on the interaction between externalities and
   land use patterns, we examine the efficiendes of first-best policies and
   second-best pricing and place-based strategies using numerical
   simulations. A first-best policy must combine both Pigouvian congestion
   tolling (PCT) and Pigouvian labor subsidies (PLS) instruments, or design
   an optimal toll (or subsidy) internalizing agglomeration externalities
   (or congestion externalities). We also examine second-best pricing
   policies if only one instrument is adopted. Congestion pricing policies
   alone (e.g., a partial PCT or a flat-rate toll) can improve social
   welfare only in heavy-congestion cities, and their welfare gains may be
   insignificant (e.g., below 10\% of the welfare improvement achieved by
   first-best policies). In contrast, second-best labor subsidy policies
   alone are a more effective alternative to first-best policies. As to
   place-based policies, the firm duster zoning (FCZ) regulation is more
   efficient than the urban growth boundary (UGB) policy. UGBs only have
   small effects on the agglomeration economy but could worsen land market
   distortions via residential rent-escalation effects. These findings
   suggest that it is important to internalize business land use decisions
   and relax monocentricity assumptions, in order to appreciate the
   interplay of both urban externalities, since spatial adaptations to
   policy interventions can distort system efficiencies. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   Potentials}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{an integral transform: A convolution with the fundamental solution of
   the PDE, also known as a volume potential. We present a Fast Multipole
   Method (FMM) for computing volume potentials and use them to construct
   spatially adaptive solvers for the Poisson, Stokes, and low-frequency
   Helmholtz problems. Conventional N-body methods apply to discrete
   particle interactions. With volume potentials, one replaces the sums
   with volume integrals. Particle N-body methods can be used to accelerate
   such integrals. but it is more efficient to develop a special FMM. In
   this article, we discuss the efficient implementation of such an FMM. We
   use high-order piecewise Chebyshev polynomials and an octree data
   structure to represent the input and output fields and enable spectrally
   accurate approximation of the near-field and the Kernel Independent FMM
   (KIFMM) for the far-field approximation. For distributed-memory
   parallelism, we use space-filling curves, locally essential trees, and a
   hypercube-like communication scheme developed previously in our group.
   We present new near and far interaction traversals that optimize cache
   usage. Also, unlike particle N-body codes, we need a 2: 1 balanced tree
   to allow for precomputations. We present a fast scheme for 2: 1
   balancing. Finally, we use vectorization, including the AVX instruction
   set on the Intel Sandy Bridge architecture to get better than 50\% of
   peak floating-point performance. We use task parallelism to employ the
   Xeon Phi on the Stampede platform at the Texas Advanced Computing Center
   (TACC). We achieve about 600GFLOP/s of double-precision performance on a
   single node. Our largest run on Stampede took 3.5s on 16K cores for a
   problem with 18E+9 unknowns for a highly nonuniform particle
   distribution (corresponding to an effective resolution exceeding 3E+23
   unknowns since we used 23 levels in our octree).}},

   Libraries for Detecting Enzyme Variants with Enhanced Activity}},
Journal = {{ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Immunogenicity is one of the most common complications occurring during
   therapy making use of protein drugs of nonhuman origin. A notable
   example of such a case is bacterial L-asparaginases (L-ASNases) used for
   the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The replacement of
   the bacterial enzymes by human ones is thought to set the basis for a
   major improvement of antileukemic therapy. Recently, we solved the
   crystal structure of a human enzyme possessing L-ASNase activity,
   designated hASNase-3. This enzyme is expressed as an inactive precursor
   protein and post-translationally undergoes intramolecular processing
   leading to the generation of two subunits which remain noncovalently,
   yet tightly associated and constitute the catalytically active form of
   the enzyme. We discovered that this intramolecular processing can be
   drastically and selectively accelerated by the free amino acid glycine.
   In the present study, we report on the molecular engineering of
   hASNase-3 aiming at the improvement of its catalytic properties. We
   created a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based
   high-throughput screening system for the characterization of rationally
   designed mutant libraries, capitalizing on the finding that free glycine
   promotes autoproteolytic cleavage, which activates the mutant proteins
   expressed in an E. coli strain devoid of aspartate biosynthesis.
   Successive screening rounds led to the isolation of catalytically
   improved variants showing up to 6-fold better catalytic efficiency as
   compared to the wild-type enzyme. Our work establishes a powerful
   strategy for further exploitation of the human asparaginase sequence
   space to facilitate the identification of in vitro-evolved enzyme
   species that will lay the basis for improved ALL therapy.}},

Abstract = {{As the feature size keeps scaling down and the circuit complexity
   increases rapidly, a more advanced hybrid lithography, which combines
   multiple patterning and electron-beam lithography (EBL), is promising to
   further enhance the pattern resolution. In this paper, we formulate the
   layout decomposition problem for this hybrid lithography as a minimum
   vertex deletion K-partition problem, where K is the number of masks in
   multiple patterning. Stitch minimization and EBL throughput are
   considered uniformly by adding a virtual vertex between two feature
   vertices for each stitch candidate during the conflict graph
   construction phase. For K = 2, we propose a primal-dual (PD) method for
   solving the underlying minimum odd-cycle cover problem efficiently. In
   addition, a chain decomposition algorithm is employed for removing all
   ``noncyclable{''} edges. Furthermore, we investigate two versions of the
   PD method, one with planarization and one without. For K > 2, we propose
   a random-initialized local search method that iteratively applies the PD
   solver. Experimental results show that compared with a two-stage method,
   our proposed methods reduce the EBL usage by 65.5\% with double
   patterning and 38.7\% with triple patterning on average for the
   benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a low complexity antenna selection algorithm for low target
   rate users in cloud radio access networks. The algorithm consists of two
   phases. In the first phase, each remote radio head (RRH) determines
   whether to be included in a candidate set by using a predefined
   selection threshold. In the second phase, RRHs are randomly selected
   within the candidate set made in the first phase. To analyze the
   performance of the proposed algorithm, we model RRHs' and users'
   locations by a homogeneous Poisson point process, whereby the
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) complementary cumulative distribution
   function is derived. By approximating the derived expression, an
   approximate optimum selection threshold that maximizes the SIR coverage
   probability is obtained. Using the obtained threshold, we characterize
   the performance of the algorithm in an asymptotic regime, where the RRH
   density goes to infinity. The obtained threshold is then modified
   depending on various algorithm options. A distinguishable feature of the
   proposed algorithm is that the algorithm complexity keeps constant
   independent to the RRH density, so that a user is able to connect to a
   network without heavy computation at baseband units.}},

   known (in the finite-dimensional case) equivalence of the Bayes risk of
   the MAP estimator with the trace of the posterior covariance, for the
   Gaussian linear case, to the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space case.}},

Title = {{Therapeutic assessment of mesenchymal stem cells delivered within a
   PEGylated fibrin gel following an ischemic injury}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{9-19}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The intent of the current study was to investigate the therapeutic
   contribution of MSCs to vascular regeneration and functional recovery of
   ischemic tissue. We used a rodent hind limb ischemia model and
   intramuscularly delivered MSCs within a PEGylated fibrin gel matrix.
   Within this model, we demonstrated that MSC therapy, when delivered in
   PEGylated fibrin, results in significantly higher mature blood vessel
   formation, which allows for greater functional recovery of skeletal
   muscle tissue as assessed using force production measurements. We
   observed initial signs of vascular repair at early time points when MSCs
   were delivered without PEGylated fibrin, but this did not persist or
   lead to recovery of the tissue in the long-term. Furthermore, animals
   which were treated with PEGylated fibrin alone exhibited a greater
   number of mature blood vessels, but they did not arterialize and did not
   show improvements in force production. These results demonstrate that
   revascularization of ischemic tissue may be a necessary but not
   sufficient step to complete functional repair of the injured tissue.
   This work has implications on stem cell therapies for ischemic diseases
   and also potentially on how such therapies are evaluated. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We explore the use of the non-symmetric Nitsche method for the weak
   imposition of boundary and coupling conditions along interfaces that
   intersect through a finite element mesh. In contrast to symmetric
   Nitsche methods, it does not require stabilization and therefore does
   not depend on the appropriate estimation of stabilization parameters. We
   first review the available mathematical background, recollecting
   relevant aspects of the method from a numerical analysis viewpoint. We
   then compare accuracy and convergence of symmetric and non-symmetric
   Nitsche methods for a Laplace problem, a Kirchhoff plate, and in 3D
   elasticity. Our numerical experiments confirm that the non-symmetric
   method leads to reduced accuracy in the L-2 error, but exhibits superior
   accuracy and robustness for derivative quantities such as diffusive
   flux, bending moments or stress. Based on our numerical evidence, the
   non-symmetric Nitsche method is a viable alternative for problems with
   diffusion-type operators, in particular when the accuracy of derivative
   quantities is of primary interest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Appropriate complexity landscape modeling}},
Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{111-130}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Advances in computing technology, new and ongoing restoration
   initiatives, concerns about climate change's effects, and the increasing
   interdisciplinarity of research have encouraged the development of
   landscape-scale mechanistic models of coupled ecological-geophysical
   systems. However, communication barriers and uneven infiltration of new
   strategies for data-driven induction persist in the context of
   simulation model development across disciplines. One challenge is that
   ecology and the geosciences have embraced different modeling
   epistemologies, with ecologists historically favoring inductive
   inference from generalized, phenomenological models and geoscientists
   favoring deductive inference from detailed first-principles models.
   Today, many models used for environmental management, particularly for
   aquatic ecosystems, tend to be highly detailed, with ecological and
   geophysical components represented in different modules that are linked
   but often not closely integrated. These observations highlight a need
   for cross-disciplinary dialogue about landscape-scale modeling
   objectives and approaches. The philosophies of pattern-oriented modeling
   in ecology and exploratory modeling in geophysics have yielded advances
   in theoretical and applied knowledge in both of those disciplines, but
   they are not comprehensive across all aspects of landscape-scale
   modeling. Here we define and synthesize the ``Appropriate Complexity
   Method{''} (ACME), which builds upon these two philosophies to guide the
   development of process oriented models across a spectrum of scientific
   and management objectives. ACME helps modelers efficiently converge upon
   an optimal modeling structure through: i) systematic evaluation of the
   attributes that comprise computational and representational detail, for
   which we have developed an operational decision tree; ii) iterative
   adjustment of models based on pattern-oriented model evaluation
   strategies; and iii) the use of appropriate datasets (where applicable)
   to build conceptual models and formulate predictions. Decisions about
   aspects of computational and representational detail are based on the
   landscape's emergent properties. They are also based on a hierarchy of
   classes of questions governing model objectives that represent a
   multi-attribute tradeoff among validation potential, interpretability,
   tractability, and generality as functions of computational and
   representational detail. Tradeoff curves, together with model
   objectives, provide further guidance for determining the
   ``appropriate{''} level of complexity for representation of processes in
   models. Once deemed adequate for addressing the original research
   question of interest, models may be used for projection and scenario
   testing. They may next undergo expansion that moves them down the
   hierarchy, where they can then be used to address research questions of
   higher specificity, detail, and validation potential, though at a cost
   of lower tractability and interpretability on the tradeoff curves. This
   practical, systematic procedure provides clear guidance for the design
   and improvement of landscape models that may be used to address a wide
   variety of questions relevant to restoration, over a spectrum of scales.

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{We discuss the computational modeling of a single microplasma and its
   interaction with high frequency electromagnetic waves in a microwave
   regime. The work is motivated by a strong recent interest in the area of
   reconfigurable plasma-based metamaterials (MM) and photonic crystals
   (PC) where the interaction of electromagnetic waves with plasma elements
   (e.g. microdischarges) forms the basis for the MM/PC operation. In this
   work the microplasma is assumed to be driven by a 1 GHz microwave source
   in a parallel plate electrode configuration. Its structure and
   properties are described using a fluid plasma model. The interaction of
   the microplasma with a 100 GHz transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse
   electric (TE) polarized microwave propagating in a rectangular waveguide
   is studied. Two operational regimes of the plasma discharge are
   considered. One in which the peak electron density is less than the
   critical density (under-dense) for the interacting wave and the other in
   which it is higher (overdense). The under-dense plasma with positive
   less than unity dielectric constant has sufficient dielectric contrast
   from the surrounding medium that a slight perturbation of the incident
   wave and bending of wave path lines through the discharge is realized.
   The over-dense plasma interacts strongly with the TM polarized wave
   because of epsilon-zero resonance at the critical density locations and
   the wave path lines are observed to reverse their direction near the
   regions of critical plasma density. The transverse electric (TE)
   polarized wave does not exhibit epsilon-zero resonance and the
   interactions are weaker than the TM wave.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of drug delivery is to ensure that therapeutic molecules reach
   the intended target organ or tissue, such that the effectiveness of the
   drug is maximized. The efficiency of a drug delivery system greatly
   depends on the choice of drug carrier. Recently, there has been growing
   interest in using micro- and nanofibers for this purpose. The reasons
   for this growing interest include these materials' high surface area to
   volume ratios, ease of fabrication, high mechanical properties, and
   desirable drug release profile. Here, we review developments in using
   these materials made by the most prevalent methods of fiber fabrication:
   electrospinning, micro fluidics, wet spinning, rotary spinning, and
   self-assembly for drug delivery purposes. Additionally, we discuss the
   potential to use these fiber based systems in research and clinical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a new algorithm to simulate single- and two-phase viscous
   flow through a three-dimensional Cartesian representation of the porous
   space, such as those available through X-ray microtomography. We use the
   finite difference method to discretize the governing equations and also
   propose a new method to enforce the incompressible flow constraint under
   zero Neumann boundary conditions for the velocity components. Finite
   difference formulation leads to fast parallel implementation through
   linear solvers for sparse matrices, allowing relatively fast
   simulations, while regularization techniques used on solving inverse
   problems lead to the desired incompressible fluid flow.
   Tests performed using benchmark samples show good agreement with
   experimental/theoretical values. Additional tests are run on Bentheimer
   and Buff Berea sandstone samples with available laboratory measurements.
   We compare the results from our new method, based on finite differences,
   with an open source finite volume implementation as well as experimental
   results, specifically to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of each
   method. Finally, we calculate relative permeability by using this
   modified finite difference technique together with a level set based
   algorithm for multi-phase fluid distribution in the pore space. To our
   knowledge this is the first time regularization techniques are used in
   combination with finite difference fluid flow simulations. (C) 2016

Title = {{Intercomparison of 3D pore-scale flow and solute transport simulation
   methods}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{176-189}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Multiple numerical approaches have been developed to simulate porous
   media fluid flow and solute transport at the pore scale. These include
   1) methods that explicitly model the three-dimensional geometry of pore
   spaces and 2) methods that conceptualize the pore space as a
   topologically consistent set of stylized pore bodies and pore throats.
   In previous work we validated a model of the first type, using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes employing a standard finite
   volume method (FVM), against magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV)
   measurements of pore-scale velocities. Here we expand that validation to
   include additional models of the first type based on the lattice
   Boltzmann method (LBM) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), as
   well as a model of the second type, a pore-network model (PNM). The PNM
   approach used in the current study was recently improved and
   demonstrated to accurately simulate solute transport in a
   two-dimensional experiment. While the PNM approach is computationally
   much less demanding than direct numerical simulation methods, the effect
   of conceptualizing complex three-dimensional pore geometries on solute
   transport in the manner of PNMs has not been fully determined. We apply
   all four approaches (FVM-based CFD, LBM, SPH and PNM) to simulate
   pore-scale velocity distributions and (for capable codes) nonreactive
   solute transport, and intercompare the model results. Comparisons are
   drawn both in terms of macroscopic variables (e.g., permeability, solute
   breakthrough curves) and microscopic variables (e.g., local velocities
   and concentrations). Generally good agreement was achieved among the
   various approaches, but some differences were observed depending on the
   model context. The intercomparison work was challenging because of
   variable capabilities of the codes, and inspired some code enhancements
   to allow consistent comparison of flow and transport simulations across
   the full suite of methods. This study provides support for confidence in
   a variety of pore-scale modeling methods and motivates further
   development and application of pore-scale simulation methods. (C) 2015

Title = {{Assessing the utility of FIB-SEM images for shale digital rock physics}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{302-316}},

Abstract = {{Shales and other unconventional or low permeability (tight) reservoirs
   house vast quantities of hydrocarbons, often demonstrate considerable
   water uptake, and are potential repositories for fluid sequestration.
   The pore scale topology and fluid transport mechanisms within these
   nanoporous sedimentary rocks remain to be fully understood.
   Image-informed pore-scale models are useful tools for studying porous
   media: a debated question in shale pore-scale petrophysics is whether
   there is a representative elementary volume (REV) for shale models?
   Furthermore, if an REV exists, how does it differ among petrophysical
   properties? We obtain three dimensional (3D) models of the topology of
   microscale shale volumes from image analysis of focused ion
   beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) image stacks and investigate
   the utility of these models as a potential REV for shale. The scope of
   data used in this work includes multiple local groups of neighboring
   FIB-SEM images of different microscale sizes, corresponding core-scale
   (milli- and centimeters) laboratory data, and, for comparison, series of
   two-dimensional (2D) cross sections from broad ion beam SEM images
   (BIB-SEM), which capture a larger microscale field of view than the
   FIB-SEM images; this array of data is larger than the majority of
   investigations with FIB-SEM-derived microscale models of shale.
   Properties such as porosity, organic matter content, and pore
   connectivity are extracted from each model. Assessments of permeability
   with single phase, pressure-driven flow simulations are performed in the
   connected pore space of the models using the lattice-Boltzmann method.
   Calculated petrophysical properties are compared to those of neighboring
   FIB-SEM images and to core-scale measurements of the sample associated
   with the FIB-SEM sites. Results indicate that FIB-SEM images below
   similar to 5000 mu m(3) volume (the largest volume analyzed) are not a
   suitable REV for shale permeability and pore-scale networks; i.e. field
   of view is compromised at the expense of detailed, but often
   unconnected, nanopore morphology. Further, we find that it is necessary
   to acquire several local FIB-SEM or BIB-SEM images and correlate their
   extracted geometric properties to improve the likelihood of achieving
   representative values of porosity and organic matter volume. Our work
   indicates that FIB-SEM images of microscale volumes of shale are a
   qualitative tool for petrophysical and transport analysis. Finally, we
   offer alternatives for quantitative pore-scale assessments of shale. (C)

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A medium-order dynamic model was developed in gPROMS (R) for an
   intercooled CO2 absorber column with piperazine solvent. This model
   represents an improvement from previously published rate-based dynamic
   models because it uses a regressed eNRTL thermodynamic package and a
   liquid film mass transfer coefficient with an experimentally measured
   CO2 loading dependence. Off-design simulation results were validated
   against a high-order steady state model, and the maximum predicted
   column temperature differed by less than 1.2 degrees C for 100-85\% flue
   gas load. Operating the absorber at a constant liquid to gas (L/G) ratio
   results in favorable dynamic behavior with disturbances in flue gas
   load, but a commercial system will not have a reliable flue gas flow
   measurement. The medium-order model was used to identify a liquid phase
   temperature within the top bed of absorber packing as a control variable
   that is sensitive to changes in L/G ratio. As the flue gas load was
   ramped from 100\% to 80\%, a maximum L/G ratio deviation of 0.9\% was
   observed when controlling the column temperature with the solvent
   flowrate. Feedforward control may be necessary to account for other
   process disturbances that influence the temperature profile and was
   shown to be effective at counteracting a step change in intercooling
   temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The advanced flash stripper (AFS) is an intensified process design for
   CO2 solvent regeneration in amine scrubbing. This work identified
   self-optimizing controlled variables for the energy recovery bypass
   flowrates of the AFS, as well as a controller configuration for the
   steam extraction flowrate. Two self optimizing variables were selected
   using a high-fidelity steady state process model: the temperature
   difference at the top of the stripper packing and the temperature
   difference on the hot end of the stripper overhead heat exchanger.
   Ranges of possible off-design conditions for the rich loading, absorber
   temperature, rich flowrate, and flash tank operating temperature were
   evaluated, and the worst case heat duty for CO2 stripping of the
   self-optimizing control scheme was within 1\% of the true system
   optimum. A low-order dynamic model was used to test the proposed
   self-optimizing control strategy and showed no significant control loop
   interactions in the closed-loop response. Cascade control, where the
   inner loop controlled the steam heater effluent temperature and the
   outer loop controlled the flash tank temperature, was found to have
   favorable dynamic performance compared to a non-cascaded structure with
   uncontrolled flash tank temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dividing wall columns (DWC) are an energy-efficient distillation setup
   that promises capital cost and energy savings. This review focuses on
   DWCs as a ternary separation technology for hydrocarbon mixtures
   relevant to the chemical and refining industries. One of the reasons

   challenge resulting from DWCs' highly integrated nature. This review
   summarizes available literature on DWC control approaches, from
   multi-loop linear structures to advanced model-based control. We
   conclude that, although achieving stable DWC operation is certainly
   possible, the development of a comprehensive framework that incorporates
   (multiple and often conflicting) process operating objectives, and
   equipment and process constraints, into a transparent control strategy

Abstract = {{Extracting hydrologic and geomorphic features from high resolution

   illustrate the new capabilities and features of GeoNet, an open source

   been further developed and includes a median filtering operation to
   remove roads in engineered landscapes and the calculation of hillslope
   lengths to inform the channel head identification procedure. The
   software is now available in both MATLAB and Python, allowing it to
   handle datasets larger than the ones previously analyzed. We present the
   workflow of GeoNet using three different test cases; natural high
   relief, engineered low relief, and urban landscapes. We analyze default
   and user-defined parameters, provide guidance on setting parameter
   values, and discuss the parameter effect on the extraction results.
   Metrics on computational time versus dataset size are also presented. We
   show the ability of GeoNet to objectively and accurately extract channel
   features in terrains of various characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   larger diffusion pre-factors, which can have implications in the
   material-selection process to determine which combination of materials
   offer the most efficient switching. Furthermore, we found that motion of

Title = {{Effects of reservoir heterogeneity on scaling of effective mass transfer
   coefficient for solute transport}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{181-193}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Modeling transport process at large scale requires proper scale-up of
   subsurface heterogeneity and an understanding of its interaction with
   the underlying transport mechanisms. A technique based on volume
   averaging is applied to quantitatively assess the scaling
   characteristics of effective mass transfer coefficient in heterogeneous
   reservoir models. The effective mass transfer coefficient represents the
   combined contribution from diffusion and dispersion to the transport of
   non-reactive solute particles within a fluid phase. Although treatment
   of transport problems with the volume averaging technique has been
   published in the past, application to geological systems exhibiting
   realistic spatial variability remains a challenge. Previously, the
   authors developed a new procedure where results from a fine-scale
   numerical flow simulation reflecting the full physics of the transport
   process albeit over a sub-volume of the reservoir are integrated with
   the volume averaging technique to provide effective description of
   transport properties. The procedure is extended, such that spatial
   averaging is performed at the local-heterogeneity scale.
   In this paper, the transport of a passive (non-reactive) solute is
   simulated on multiple reservoir models exhibiting different patterns of
   heterogeneities, and the scaling behavior of effective mass transfer
   coefficient (Kell) is examined and compared. One such set of models
   exhibit power-law (fractal) characteristics, and the variability of
   dispersion and K-eff with scale is in good agreement with analytical
   expressions described in the literature. This work offers an insight
   into the impacts of heterogeneity on the scaling of effective transport
   parameters. A key finding is that spatial heterogeneity models with
   similar univariate and bivariate statistics may exhibit different
   scaling characteristics because of the influence of higher order
   statistics. More mixing is observed in the channelized models with
   higher-order continuity. It reinforces the notion that the flow response
   is influenced by the higher-order statistical description of
   heterogeneity. An important implication is that when scaling-up
   transport response from lab-scaleresults to the field scale, it is
   necessary to account for the scale-up of heterogeneity. Since the
   characteristics of higher-order multivariate distributions and
   large-scale heterogeneity are typically not captured in small-scale
   experiments, a reservoir modeling framework that captures the
   uncertainty in heterogeneity description should be adopted. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Heliotropic orbits provide long-lifetime low-altitude orbits in the
   presence of large J2 and solar radiation pressure perturbations. Formal
   inclusion of high-degree zonal gravity harmonics and simple shadowing
   provides a more realistic model to initiate the search for heliotropic
   orbits at irregular primitive bodies like Bennu, which is the target of
   the OSIRIS-Rex mission. The constrained, doubly averaged potential and
   the Lagrange planetary equations yield a single equation to enforce the
   heliotropic constraint. The equation is solved for inclinations across a
   range of semimajor axes and eccentricities, providing a surface of
   potential solutions. The fast process allows for MonteCarlo simulations
   to assess the likelihood of a heliotropic orbit existing in the presence
   of parameter uncertainty. The existence of heliotropic orbits is shown
   to be reasonably robust to uncertainty in the solar radiation pressure
   acceleration and reference gravity parameters for Bennu.}},

Title = {{Reliability-Based Performance Indicators for Structural Members}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The implementation of reliability methods for designing new structures
   and assessing the safety and evaluating the performance of existing
   structures and infrastructure systems has gained widespread acceptance.
   Consequently, reliability-based design specifications in the form of
   load and resistance factor design (LRFD) methods have dominated the
   development of current codes and standards. This paper reviews the
   reliability-based performance criteria used to calibrate design and
   evaluation codes and standards for assessing the strength,
   serviceability, and fatigue resistance of structural components. The
   review shows that large differences exist in the target reliability
   levels adopted for evaluating the strength of various types of
   structural members and materials. These differences result from many
   factors, including (1)intended structure design and service life;
   (2)expected member modes of failure (e.g.,ductile or brittle);
   (3)importance of the individual member to overall system integrity
   (secondary member, column, or connection); (4)experiences with previous
   designs; (5)material and construction costs; (6)structure type and
   occupancy; and (7)risk tolerance of the engineering community and the
   public within a code's jurisdiction. For other than seismic hazards,
   current specifications remain primarily focused on the evaluation of
   individual structural members and components, although recently proposed
   performance-based design (PBD) procedures apply varying target member
   reliability levels that depend on structure categories, modes of
   failure, and required levels of structural performance. The
   implementation of reliability-based durability criteria in design
   standards is still a subject of research owing to difficulties
   encountered in modeling material degradation mechanisms and their
   interactions and in the collection and mapping of long-term
   site-specific data on degrading agents. Because of large epistemic
   uncertainties, the evaluation of the fatigue safety of structural
   components in engineering practice still relies on conservative basic
   models of damage accumulation using S-N curves or basic fracture
   mechanics crack growth models. Overall, reliability-calibrated
   structural standards are producing designs that offer a good balance
   between safety and cost. The future implementation of risk-based methods
   will further enhance the ability to meet structure-specific performance
   requirements set by owners and users.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing consistent criteria for assessing the performance of
   structural systems and infrastructure networks is a critical component
   of communities' efforts to optimize investment decisions for the upkeep
   and renewal of the built environment. Although member-level performance
   and reliability assessment procedures are currently well-established, it
   is widely recognized that a member-oriented approach does not
   necessarily lead to an efficient utilization of limited resources when
   making decisions related to the management of existing deteriorating
   structures or lifeline systems, especially those that may be exposed to
   extreme events. For this reason, researchers have renewed their
   interests in developing system-level assessment methods as a basis to
   modern structural and infrastructure performance evaluation and design
   processes. Specifically, system-level performance metrics and
   characteristics such as reliability, redundancy, robustness, resilience,
   and risk continue to be refined. The objective of this paper is to
   extend the content of the accompanying paper on reliability-based
   performance indicators for structural members by reviewing proposals for
   the development and implementation of performance-based criteria for
   structural systems and infrastructure networks. The paper reviews
   established concepts of reliability design along with emerging ideas of
   performance-based and resilience-based design that are especially
   relevant for assessing and managing system-level risk. The paper also
   studies structural redundancy and robustness concepts as well as
   network-level performance metrics along with ranking approaches.
   Insights from these analyses reveal the need for transitioning
   structural and infrastructure design processes from a traditional
   component-level reliability-based approach, to one that seeks uniform
   levels of risk across scales (from structural systems to interconnected
   infrastructure networks across communities). Implementation examples are
   drawn from experiences with buildings, bridges, offshore oil and gas
   platforms, and a variety of infrastructure systems. The paper also
   reflects on promising avenues for pursuing practical and calibrated
   system-level performance indicators that support life cycle performance,
   safety, reliability, and risk of structural and infrastructure systems
   as integral parts of resilient communities.}},

Abstract = {{The world is a noisy place, and animals have evolved a myriad of
   strategies to communicate in it. Animal communication signals are,
   however, often multimodal; their components can be processed by multiple
   sensory systems, and noise can thus affect signal components across
   different modalities. We studied the effect of environmental noise on
   multimodal communication in the tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus).
   Males communicate with rivals using airborne sounds combined with
   call-induced water ripples. We tested males under control as well as
   noisy conditions in which we mimicked rain-and wind-induced vibrations
   on the water surface. Males responded more strongly to a multimodal
   playback in which sound and ripples were combined, compared to a
   unimodal sound-only playback, but only in the absence of rain and wind.
   Under windy conditions, males decreased their response to the multimodal
   playback, suggesting that wind noise interferes with the detection of
   rival ripples. Under rainy conditions, males increased their response,
   irrespective of signal playback, suggesting that different noise sources
   can have different impacts on communication. Our findings show that
   noise in an additional sensory channel can affect multimodal signal
   perception and thereby drive signal evolution, but not always in the
   expected direction.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchical processes spanning several orders of magnitude of both
   space and time underlie nearly all cancers. Multi-scale statistical,
   mathematical, and computational modeling methods are central to
   designing, implementing and assessing treatment strategies that account
   for these hierarchies. The basic science underlying these modeling
   efforts is maturing into a new discipline that is close to influencing
   and facilitating clinical successes. The purpose of this review is to
   capture the state-of-the-art as well as the key barriers to success for
   multi-scale modeling in clinical oncology. We begin with a summary of
   the long-envisioned promise of multi-scale modeling in clinical
   oncology, including the synthesis of disparate data types into models
   that reveal underlying mechanisms and allow for experimental testing of
   hypotheses. We then evaluate the mathematical techniques employed most
   widely and present several examples illustrating their application as
   well as the current gap between preclinical and clinical applications.
   We conclude with a discussion of what we view to be the key challenges
   and opportunities for multi-scale modeling in clinical oncology.}},

Abstract = {{The indoor environment can contribute significantly to population
   exposure to ozone. This paper reviews the state of knowledge on building
   materials and coatings that are intended to passively remove ozone from
   indoor air. These passive removal materials, or PRMs, should have high
   ozone removal potential without significant and harmful reaction product
   formation. Ozone interactions with indoor environments, including
   surface and gas-phase reactions, known byproducts of these reactions,
   and health impacts of ozone and its byproducts are described. Research
   that has targeted PRMs for ozone removal is then summarized, and the
   materials in question are assessed in terms of their ability to reduce
   indoor ozone concentrations; ozone deposition velocities, reaction
   probabilities, as well as byproduct molar yields are presented and
   compared. This evaluation of the literature suggests that the most
   promising PRMs for ozone control are inorganic materials, including
   clay-based bricks and plasters, calcareous stone, and ceiling tile made
   of mineral fibers or volcanic perlite. Simple model equations are
   presented and used to highlight the potential for PRMs as a means for
   reducing indoor ozone concentrations. The removal effectiveness for
   ozone and reaction-derived formaldehyde is predicted for a commercially
   available wall coating (clay paint) applied in a residential building.
   Removal effectiveness is also discussed in the context of required
   surface area and application costs for clay paint. A list of
   conclusions, limitations and research needs based on the existing
   knowledge base is also presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A chemical EOR benchmark study of different reservoir simulators}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Interest in chemical EOR processes has intensified in recent years due
   to the advancements in chemical formulations and injection techniques.
   Injecting Polymer (P), surfactant/polymer (SP), and
   alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) are techniques for improving sweep and
   displacement efficiencies with the aim of improving oil production in
   both secondary and tertiary floods. There has been great interest in
   chemical flooding recently for different challenging situations. These
   include high temperature reservoirs, formations with extreme salinity
   and hardness, naturally fractured carbonates, and sandstone reservoirs
   with heavy and viscous crude oils.
   More oil reservoirs are reaching maturity where secondary polymer floods
   and tertiary surfactant methods have become increasingly important. This
   significance has added to, the industry's interest in using reservoir
   simulators as tools for reservoir evaluation and management to minimize
   costs and increase the process efficiency. Reservoir simulators with
   special features are needed to represent coupled chemical and physical
   processes present in chemical EOR processes. The simulators need to be
   first validated against well controlled lab and pilot scale experiments
   to reliably predict the full field implementations.
   The available data from laboratory scale include 1) phase behavior and
   rheological data; and 2) results of secondary and tertiary coreflood
   experiments for 13, SP, and ASP floods under reservoir conditions, i.e.
   chemical retentions, pressure drop, and oil recovery. Data collected
   from corefloods are used as benchmark tests comparing numerical
   reservoir simulators with chemical EOR modeling capabilities such as
   STARS of CMG, ECLIPSE-100 of Schlumberger, REVEAL of Petroleum Experts.
   The research UTCHEM simulator from The University of Texas at Austin is
   also included since it has been the benchmark for chemical flooding
   simulation for over 25 years.
   The results of this benchmark comparison will be utilized to improve
   chemical design for field-scale studies using commercial simulators. The
   benchmark tests illustrate the potential of commercial simulators for
   chemical flooding projects and provide a comprehensive table of
   strengths and limitations of each simulator for a given chemical EOR
   process. Mechanistic simulations of chemical EOR processes will provide
   predictive capability and can aid in optimization of the field injection
   projects. The objective of this paper is not to compare the
   computational efficiency and solution algorithms; it only focuses on the
   process modeling comparison. (C) 2016 Elsevier. Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{As part of a Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation research
   project led by researchers at the University of Washington with
   collaborators at University at Buffalo, and Taiwan National Center for
   Research on Earthquake Engineering, a self-centering steel plate shear
   wall (SC-SPSW) system has been developed to achieve enhanced seismic
   performance objectives, including recentering. The SC-SPSW consists of
   thin steel infill panels, referred to as web plates that serve as the
   primary lateral load-resisting and energy dissipating element of the
   system. Posttensioned (PT) beam-to-column connections provide system
   recentering capabilities. A performance-based design procedure has been
   developed for the SC-SPSW, and a series of nonlinear response history
   analyses have been conducted to verify intended seismic performance at
   multiple hazard levels. Quasi-static subassembly tests, quasi-static and
   shake table tests of scaled three-story specimens, and pseudo-dynamic
   tests of two full-scale two-story SC-SPSWs have been conducted. As a
   culmination of this multi-year, multi-institutional project, this paper
   will present an overview of the SCSPSW numerical and experimental
   research programs. This paper will also discuss innovative PT connection
   and web plate designs that were investigated to improve
   constructability, resilience, and seismic performance and that can be
   applied to other self-centering and steel plate shear wall systems.}},

Abstract = {{The steady-state performance of low frequency AC (LFAC) systems for bulk
   power transmission is proposed and investigated in this paper. It is
   demonstrated that the LFAC is superior to the conventional 60 Hz AC
   system in terms of power transfer capability and voltage stability. An
   existing power system can increase its power transfer capability by up
   to more than eleven times if it operates at 5 Hz. In low operating
   frequency conditions, the transmission overhead line reactance is
   significantly lowered and thus results in less voltage drop along the
   line. If the system operating frequency is in the range of 1 to 10 Hz,
   the voltage profile along a transmission line is comparable to the surge
   impedance loading at the no-load condition or approaches that of the
   HVDC system at the full-load condition. More importantly, the V-P and
   Q-V characteristic curves show that the dependency of voltage on the
   real and reactive power flow is greatly reduced. In other words, the
   sensitivity of voltage on reactive power variations is diminished and
   results in a more stable voltage and a higher stability margin for the
   LFAC system compared to the conventional 60 Hz system.}},

Abstract = {{Time-varying renewable energy generation can result in serious
   under-/over-voltage conditions in future distribution grids. Augmenting
   conventional utility-owned voltage regulating equipment with the
   reactive power capabilities of distributed generation units is a viable
   solution. Local control options attaining global voltage regulation
   optimality at fast convergence rates is the goal here. In this context,
   novel reactive power control rules are analyzed under a unifying
   linearized grid model. For single-phase grids, our proximal gradient
   scheme has computational complexity comparable to that of the rule
   suggested by the IEEE 1547.8 standard, but it enjoys well-characterized
   convergence guarantees. Furthermore, adding memory to the scheme results
   in accelerated convergence. For three-phase grids, it is shown that
   reactive power injections have a counter-intuitive effect on bus voltage
   magnitudes across phases. Nevertheless, when our control scheme is
   applied to unbalanced conditions, it is shown to reach an equilibrium
   point. Numerical tests using the IEEE 13-bus, the IEEE 123-bus, and a
   Southern California Edison 47-bus feeder with increased renewable
   penetration verify the properties of the schemes and their resiliency to
   grid topology reconfigurations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a Bayesian estimation scheme for hidden Markov
   model (HMM) parameters, as well as a method for monitoring systems whose
   degradation processes are modeled using HMMs identified using this novel
   estimation approach. The Bayesian estimation naturally yields
   information about model parametric uncertainties via posterior
   distributions of HMM parameters emanating from the estimation procedure.
   Numerous simulations implementing the newly proposed method for
   estimation of HMM parameters were conducted demonstrating its capability
   to identify several types of HMMs, including the commonly encountered
   ergodic and homogeneous HMM, as well as less commonly studied nonergodic
   or/and nonhomogeneous HMM. In addition, a novel condition monitoring
   scheme based on uncertain HMMs of the degradation process is proposed
   and demonstrated on a large dataset obtained from a
   semiconductor-manufacturing facility. A small portion of the data was
   used to build operating mode specific HMMs of machine degradation via
   the newly proposed Bayesian estimation, while the remainder of the data
   was used for condition monitoring based on the uncertain degradation
   HMMs yielded by the novel Bayesian estimation method. Comparison with a
   traditional sensory signature-based statistical monitoring method showed
   that the newly proposed approach significantly outperforms the
   traditional method in terms of its detection capabilities and false
   alarm ratios.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a new model for constructing annual block
   schedules for family medicine residents based on the rules and
   procedures followed by the Family Medicine Department at the University
   of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (UTHSC-SA). Such residency
   programs provide 3years of specialty training for recent medical school
   graduates. At the beginning of each academic year, each trainee is given
   an annual block schedule that indicates his or her monthly assignments.
   These assignments are called rotations and include a variety of
   experiences, such as pediatric ambulatory care, the emergency room, and
   inpatient surgery. An important requirement associated with a subset of
   the rotations is that the residents spend multiple half-day sessions a
   week in a primary care clinic treating patients from the community. This
   is a key consideration when constructing the annual block schedules. In
   particular, one of the primary goals of most residencies is to ensure
   that the number of residents in clinic each day is approximately the
   same, so that the number of patients that can be seen each day is also
   the same. Uniformity provides for a more efficient use of supervisory
   and staff resources.The difficulty in achieving this goal is that not
   all rotations allow for clinic duty and that the number of patients that
   can be seen by a resident each session depends on his or her year of
   training. When constructing annual block schedules, two high-level sets
   of variables are available to the program coordinator. The first is the
   assignment of residents to rotations for each of the 12 blocks, and the
   second is the (partial) ability to adjust the days on which a resident
   has clinic duty during each rotation. In approaching the problem, our
   aim was to redesign the current rotations while giving all residents a
   12-month schedule that concurrently (i) balances the number of patients
   that can be seen in the clinic during each half-day session and (ii)
   minimizes the number of adjustments necessary to achieve the first
   objective. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer program;
   however, it proved too difficult to solve exactly. As an alternative,
   several optimization-based heuristics were developed that yielded good
   feasible solutions. The model and computations are illustrated with data
   provided by the Family Medicine Department at UTHSC-SA for a typical
   academic year.}},

   coefficient, thus maximum wind energy capture. Augmentations of these
   optimal techniques significantly reduced the computational cost.
   Simulation results show that, in comparison with the traditional torque
   feedback and conventional optimal control algorithms, the proposed
   augmented optimal control algorithm increases the harvested energy while
   minimizing the computational expense for speed-constrained wind turbines
   during partial load operation.}},

   0.10, 0.20, and 0.30) cathode materials, combining the advantages of the
   high specific capacity of the Ni-rich layered phase and the surface
   chemical stability of the Li-rich layered phase. X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electrochemical
   charge/discharge measurements confirm the formation of a Li-rich layered

   scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals a spatial
   relationship that the Li-rich nano-domain islands are integrated into
   the conventional Ni-rich layered matrix (R (3) over barm). Most
   importantly, this is the first time that Li-rich phase has been directly
   observed inside a particle at the nano-scale, when the overall

Abstract = {{The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
   resulted in the collection of a vast amount of situ and remotely sensed
   data that can be used to determine the spatiotemporal extent of the oil
   spill and test advances in oil spill models, verifying their utility for
   future operational use. This article summarizes observations of
   hydrocarbon dispersion collected at the surface and at depth and our
   current understanding of the factors that affect the dispersion, as well
   as our improved ability to model and predict oil and gas transport. As a
   direct result of studying the area where oil and gas spread during the
   DWH oil spill, our forecasting capabilities have been greatly enhanced.
   State-of-the-art oil spill models now include the ability to simulate
   the rise of a buoyant plume of oil from sources at the seabed to the
   surface. A number of efforts have focused on improving our understanding
   of the influences of the near-surface oceanic layer and the atmospheric
   boundary layer on oil spill dispersion, including the effects of waves.
   In the future, oil spill modeling routines will likely be included in
   Earth system modeling environments, which will link physical models
   (hydrodynamic, surface wave, and atmospheric) with marine sediment and
   biogeochemical components.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{539-549}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The presence of shocks in scramjet internal flows introduces
   nonequilibrium of internal energy modes of the molecules. Here, the
   effect of vibrational nonequilibrium on key reactions of hydrogen-air
   combustion is studied. A quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) approach is
   used to derive reaction probability for nonequilibrium conditions using
   ab initio-derived potential energy surfaces. The reaction rates under
   nonequilibrium are studied using a two-temperature description, where
   the vibrational modes are assumed to be distributed according to a
   Boltzmann distribution at a characteristic vibrational temperature, in
   addition to a translational temperature describing the translational and
   rotational population distribution. At scramjet-relevant conditions, it
   is found that the nonequilibrium reaction rate depends not only on the
   level of vibrational excitation, but also on the reactants involved.
   Conventional two-temperature models for reaction rates, often derived
   using empirical means, were found to be inaccurate under these
   conditions, and modified parameters are proposed based on the QCT
   calculations. It is also found that models that include details of the
   reaction process through dissociation energy, for instance, provide a
   better description of nonequilibrium effects.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical conditioning of engineered tissue constructs is widely
   recognized as one of the most relevant methods to enhance tissue
   accretion and microstructure, leading to improved mechanical behaviors.
   The understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains rather limited,
   restricting the development of in silico models of these phenomena, and
   the translation of engineered tissues into clinical application. In the
   present study, we examined the role of large strip-biaxial strains (up
   to 50\%) on ECM synthesis by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
   micro-integrated into electrospun polyester urethane urea (PEW)
   constructs over the course of 3 weeks. Experimental results indicated
   that VSMC biosynthetic behavior was quite sensitive to tissue strain
   maximum level, and that collagen was the primary ECM component
   synthesized. Moreover, we found that while a 30\% peak strain level
   achieved maximum ECM synthesis rate, further increases in strain level
   lead to a reduction in ECM biosynthesis. Subsequent mechanical analysis
   of the formed collagen fiber network was performed by removing the
   scaffold mechanical responses using a strain energy based approach,
   showing that the de novo collagen also demonstrated mechanical behaviors
   substantially better than previously obtained with small strain training
   and comparable to mature collagenous tissues. We conclude that the
   application of large deformations can play a critical role not only in
   the quantity of ECM synthesis (i.e. the rate of mass production), but
   also on the modulation of the stiffness of the newly formed ECM
   constituents. The improved understanding of the process of growth and
   developthent of ECM in these mechanosensitive cell-scaffold systems will
   lead to more rational design and manufacturing of engineered tissues
   operating under highly demanding mechanical environments. (C) 2016

Title = {{The effect of distributed electricity generation using natural gas on
   the electric and natural gas grids}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{177}},

Abstract = {{The efficient and economical design and operation of individual
   small-scale distributed generation (DG) units has received considerable
   attention. It is now plausible to envision a future scenario where a
   large number of such units, spanning capacities from the kW to the MW
   scale, are deployed in a region. As distributed electricity generation
   using natural gas becomes more widespread, the dependency of the
   electric grid on the natural gas grid will increase. This concerns
   multiple interaction points along the two networks, and reaches beyond
   the natural gas demand of large-scale load following or baseload gas
   fired powerplants. More specifically, a better understanding is required
   of the potential changes in the dynamic behavior and interaction of the
   electricity and natural gas grids at or close to residential use sites
   (neighborhoods), where the small-scale DG infrastructure is likely to be
   located. In this paper, an optimization-based framework is developed for
   analyzing the operation of an ensemble of small-scale natural gas fueled
   DG units, and quantify their ability to flatten the electric grid load
   (i.e., reduce the peak demand) of the neighborhood that they serve. Our
   analysis relies on realistic energy use data and takes into account
   capacity limitations of the current natural gas distribution
   infrastructure, centralized vs. decentralized control of the DG unit
   operation, equipment durability considerations, heating preferences of
   home users, and seasonal effects. There is a substantial increase in
   natural gas consumption near consumers for all scenarios considered,
   which has implications for the control of the natural gas grid. We
   demonstrate the importance of having a centralized decision-making
   scheme when multiple distributed generation resources are present, and
   make recommendations for the optimal sizing of generators. (C) 2016

Title = {{Mechanics-Based Approach for Detection and Measurement of Particle
   Contamination in Proximity Nanofabrication Processes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICRO AND NANO-MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the great progress made toward addressing the challenge of
   particle contamination in nanomanufacturing, its deleterious effect on
   yield is still not negligible. This is particularly true for
   nanofabrication processes that involve close proximity or contact
   between two or more surfaces. One such process is Jet-and-Flash Imprint
   Lithography (J-FIL (TM)), which involves the formation of a nanoscale
   liquid film between a patterned template and a substrate. In this
   process, the presence of any frontside particle taller than the liquid
   film thickness, which is typically sub-25 nm, can not only disrupt the
   continuity of this liquid film but also damage the expensive template
   upon contact. The detection of these particles has typically relied on
   the use of subwavelength optical techniques such as scatterometry that
   can suffer from low throughput for nanoscale particles. In this paper, a
   novel mechanics-based method has been proposed as an alternative to
   these techniques. It can provide a nearly 1000 x amplification of the
   particle size, thereby allowing for optical microscopy based detection.
   This technique has been supported by an experimentally validated
   multiphysics model which also allows for estimation of the loss in yield
   and potential contact-related template damage because of the particle
   encounter. Also, finer inspection of template damage needs to be carried
   out over a much smaller area, thereby increasing throughput of the
   overall process. This technique also has the potential for inline
   integration, thereby circumventing the need for separate tooling for
   subwavelength optical inspection of substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostic fracture injection tests (DFITs) are performed in low
   permeability formations to estimate the minimum principal stress,
   formation pressure, permeability, and other parameters. G-function
   derivative plots are used for diagnosing fracture closure and
   ``non-ideal{''} reservoir processes. In this study, we use a discrete
   fracture network hydraulic fracturing simulator to investigate non-ideal
   DFIT mechanisms. The simulator fully couples fluid flow with the
   stresses induced by fracture deformation. DFITs are simulated for six
   different scenarios: a single hydraulic fracture, multiple fracture
   strands, opening of transverse fractures, near-wellbore complexity,
   far-field complexity, and height recession. The results indicate that
   pressure transient behavior commonly ascribed to ``fracture height
   recession,{''} ``closure of transverse fractures,{''} and ``fracture tip
   extension{''} are likely to be misinterpreted by conventional
   techniques. In previous studies, we found that a curving upward G x
   dP/dG plot is caused by changing fracture stiffness after closure and
   that the closure pressure is best picked when G x dP/dG begins to
   deviate upward. In contrast, the commonly used ``tangent{''} method can
   significantly underestimate the minimum principal stress. The results of
   this study confirm those prior results. The results suggest that in most
   cases, it should be possible to use pump-in/flowback tests to confirm
   estimates of the minimum principal stress. However, if a flow bottleneck
   occurs at the wellbore due to near-wellbore complexity, the
   pump-in/flowback test may be uninterpretable. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{H59 block in Jilin Oilfield was selected as a pilot site for CCS (carbon
   capture and storage) project. The block is of a light oil reservoir with
   average permeability of 3.5 mD and well-developed natural fractures. CO2
   separated from a nearby natural gas reservoir was injected into the oil
   block during six years operation, with nearly 0.26 million tons of CO2
   (0.32 HCPV) has been injected. In order to evaluate the miscibility
   effect of CO2 flooding, injection and well production data were
   analyzed, including injection pressure, bottom hole flowing pressure
   (BHFP) of producer wells, CO2 breakthrough time and produced oil and gas
   compositions. Reservoir pressure distribution during CO2 injection was
   figured out based injection pressure and BHFP using the Kriging
   interpolation method, and the varying miscible region was illustrated in
   pressure contours. The analysis results show that CO2 injection can
   significantly increase oil production, but the size of the miscible
   region can be greatly reduced after early CO2 breakthrough, which can
   cause BHFP and oil production declining. In comparison with the
   experimental data of core flooding with CO2 at different modes, the
   produced oil composition data indicate that CO2 flooding in the field
   was more likely in near miscible or immiscible modes, though the
   injection pressure was higher than the MMP, which can be attributed to
   unexpected early CO2 breakthrough and low permeability nature of the
   reservoir. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to develop an ASP formulation for a sandstone
   reservoir with divalent cations in the injection brine. Development of
   an ASP formulation for the field condition involves starting with
   simplified conditions and adding the complexities incrementally. The
   surfactant system was first identified for the dead oil and softened
   injection brine. The surfactant system was then modified to work with
   the simulated live oil and the actual injection brine. The surfactant
   systems were first tested in outcrop cores. The cumulative oil recovery
   was not very high (below 90\% OOIP) initially. The surfactant system was
   modified again to achieve a negative slope in the activity diagram; the
   preflush was modified to not have any alkali. These modifications were
   tried first in the field core with the simulated live oil and the oil
   recovery was very high (98\% OOIP). The same formulation was then tested
   in the field core with the live oil and the cumulative oil recovery was
   95\% OOIP. The pressure gradients were reasonable and adsorption was
   low. This study showed that sodium carbonate can be used in an ASP
   formulation in a field brine if enough EDTA can be added to sequester
   the divalent ions. The ASP formulation should be such that the optimal
   salinity (and the three-phase salinity range) should increase with
   water-oil-ratio. The preflush should not include alkali, which could
   extract soap from the residual oil ahead of the synthetic surfactants.
   Well-designed ASP formulations can reduce the oil saturations to 1-3\%
   in field cores. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper makes both a methodological contribution as well as an
   empirical contribution. From a methodological perspective, we propose a
   new econometric approach for the estimation of joint mixed models that
   include a multiple discrete choice outcome and a nominal discrete
   outcome, in addition to the count, binary/ordinal outcomes, and
   continuous outcomes considered in traditional structural equation
   models. These outcomes are modeled together by specifying latent
   underlying unobserved individual lifestyle, personality, and attitudinal
   factors that impact the many outcomes, and generate the jointness among
   the outcomes. From an empirical perspective, we analyze residential
   location choice, household vehicle ownership choice, as well as time-use
   choices, and investigate the extent of association versus causality in
   the effects of residential density on activity participation and
   mobility choices. The sample for the empirical application is drawn from
   a travel survey conducted in the Puget Sound Region in 2014. The results
   show that residential density effects on activity participation and
   motorized auto ownership are both associative as well as causal,
   emphasizing that accounting for residential self-selection effects are
   not simply esoteric econometric pursuits, but can have important
   implications for land-use policy measures that focus on neo-urbanist
   design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Road segments with identical site-specific attributes often exhibit
   significantly different crash counts due to unobserved reasons. The
   extent of unobserved heterogeneity associated with a road feature is to
   be estimated prior to selecting the relevant safety treatment. Moreover,
   crash count data is often over-dispersed and spatially correlated. This
   paper proposes a spatial negative binomial specification with random
   parameters for modeling crash counts of contiguous road segments. The
   unobserved heterogeneity is incorporated using a finite multi-variate
   normal mixture prior on the random parameters; this allows for non
   normality, skewness in the distribution of the random parameters,
   facilitates correlation across the random parameters, and relaxes any
   distributional assumptions. The model extracts the inherent groups of
   road segments with crash counts that are equally sensitive to the road
   attributes on an average; the heterogeneity within these groups is also
   allowed in the proposed framework. The specification simultaneously
   accounts for potential spatial correlation of the crash counts from
   neighboring road segments. A Gibbs sampling framework is proposed that
   leverages recent theoretical developments on data-augmentation
   algorithms, and elegantly sidesteps many of the computational
   difficulties usually associated with Bayesian inference of count models.
   Empirical results suggests the presence of two latent groups and spatial
   correlation within the study road network. Road features with
   significantly different effect on crash counts across two latent groups
   of road segments were identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Bi2-ySryIr2O7 (Bi(2-y)Sr(y)Ir(2)O1(6)O2) alpha-pyrochlore-type solid
   solution is presented. Quantum ab initio DFT(WIEN2k) calculations were
   performed in order to understand the electrical resistivity changes
   associated to the Bi substitution by Sr in this system. The main
   crystallographic modification associated to this substitution is the x
   position of the 48f oxygen (x, 1/8, 1/8) (O1); this substitution
   substantially modifies the Bi/Sr-O1 and Ir-O1 atomic distances,
   increasing the former and diminishing the latter. Experimentally, the
   Bi2-ySryIr2O7 samples are metallic and the electrical resistivity
   increases with the Sr content. Electronic structure calculations for
   Bi2Ir2O7 and BiSrIr2O7 show that, regardless of structural changes,
   there is only a small change of electrical conductivity with the Sr
   substitution, and the experimentally observed increase of the
   resistivity can be explained in terms of a larger impact on the
   electronic structure of both; the Sr `impurities' as well as of the

Abstract = {{This paper presents modeling and validation testing of the 3-D lumped

   measuring the static force-displacement curve of a magnet over a
   single-grain bulk superconductor. The methodology presented in this
   paper uses multiple multigrain yttrium barium copper oxide
   superconducting bricks, which is more relevant to actual bearing and
   magnetic levitation designs, and a larger cylindrical permanent magnet.
   The dynamic step input response of the system is evaluated. These tests
   show that, with proper consideration of brick and grain boundaries, the
   lumped parameter method can be used to describe the dynamic behavior and
   local translational stiffness of a levitated permanent-magnet assembly.}},

Title = {{Coupled CFD-DEM simulation of hydrodynamic bridging at constrictions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{245-263}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a coupled CFD-DEM approach to simulate the flow of
   particulate suspensions in the intermediate concentration regime where
   solid volume concentration is 1\% < phi < 50\%. In particular,
   hydrodynamic multi-particle bridging during flow through a single
   constriction in a rectangular channel is studied. It is shown that for
   neutrally buoyant, monodispersed particulate suspensions, the
   probability of jamming increases with the particle concentration. There
   also exists a critical particle concentration (phi{*}) for spontaneous
   bridging, which depends on the ratio of pore size to particle size, the
   flow velocity, the particle-fluid density contrast, and the flow
   geometry leading to the constriction. The phi{*} has a strong dependence
   on the outlet-to-particle relative size (R-0). For 1.5 <= R-0 <= 2.5, a
   direct transition from a flowing state to a jammed state was observed.
   For R-0 <= 3, the flowing state typically transitioned to a dense state
   characterized by the accumulation of particles near the constriction
   before jamming. Increasing the inlet-to-particle relative size (R-ip)
   lowers phi{*} by increasing the number of particles arriving at the
   constriction simultaneously. The effect of changing R-ip is more
   pronounced at high R-0 when the probability of bridging is lower. A high
   fluid velocity increases particle interactions near the constriction and
   accelerates the onset of bridging. However, no distinct effect of
   velocity on phi{*} was observed in this study. A higher
   particle-to-fluid density ratio (rho(p)/rho(f)) increases the
   probability of bridging and leads to a lower phi{*} in a given
   constriction geometry. The effect saturates at higher rho(p)/rho(f) when
   gravitational forces completely dominate over viscous drag forces.
   phi{*} is also found to decrease with increasing angle of constriction
   convergence (theta) for theta < 30 degrees, but increases beyond that at
   theta = 60 degrees. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   exhibits a record maximum transconductance (g(m\_max)) in excess of 520
   mu S/mu m at > 1 mu m region, and reasonably good electrostatic
   integrity, such as SS = 110 mV/decade and DIBL = 43 mV/V. Also, we have
   investigated the gate length scaling behavior in terms of output,
   transconductance, and transfer characteristics. In particular, our
   devices feature very uniform values of the electrostatic integrity, such
   as SS = 100-110 mV/decade, V-T = -0.25 V to -0.2 V and DIBL = 40-50

   explored the impact of source resistance (R-S) onto the device

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{301-306}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we obtain approximate solutions to the Cluster Variation
   free energy by carrying out a cluster expansion of the probabilities
   appearing in the free energy functional in terms of
   concentration-dependent basis functions, and by truncating the expansion
   at different cluster levels prior to minimization. We show that a
   significant improvement over the Bragg-Williams approximation can be
   achieved by truncating the expansion of the cluster probabilities at
   relatively small clusters, thus dramatically reducing the number of
   equations that need to be solved in order to minimize the free energy.
   Furthermore, the free energy functional in the Cluster Variation Method
   offers a well-controlled case study to infer the effects of truncating
   the expansion of the energy of alloy formation in the commonly used
   Cluster Expansion method, versus the effects of truncating the expansion
   when using a concentration-dependent basis. Examples of the approach are
   given for simple Ising models for fcc-and bcc-based prototype alloy
   systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A highly conductive sulfur cathode is crucial for improving the kinetic
   performance of a Li-S battery. The encapsulation of sulfur in porous
   nanocarbons is expected to benefit the Li+ migration, yet the e(-)
   conduction is still to be improved due to a low graphitization degree of
   a conventional carbon substrate, especially that pyrolyzed from
   carbohydrates or polymers. Aiming at facilitating the e(-) conduction in
   the cathode, here we propose to use ketjen black, a highly graphitized
   nanocarbon building block to form a conductive network for electrons in
   a biomass-derived, hierarchically porous carbon sponge by a, easily
   scaled-up approach at a low cost. The specifically designed carbon host
   ensures a high loading and good retention of active sulfur, while also
   provides a faster electron transmission to benefit the
   lithiation/delithiation kinetics of sulfur. The sulfur cathode prepared
   from the carbon network shows excellent cycling and rate performance in
   a Li-S battery, rendering its practicality for emerging energy storage
   opportunities such as grids or automobiles.}},

   Synthesis and Their Enhanced Catalytic Performance}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Elaborate architectural manipulation of nanohybrids with
   multi-components into controllable 3D hierarchical structures is of
   great significance for both fundamental scientific interest and
   realization of various functionalities, yet remains a great challenge
   because different materials with distinct physical/chemical properties
   could hardly be incorporated simultaneously into the synthesis process.
   Here, we develop a novel one-pot cyanogel-bridged synthetic approach for
   the generation of 3D flower-like metal/Prussian blue analogue
   nanohybrids, namely PdCo/Pd-hexacyanocobaltate for the first time. The
   judicious introduction of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the formation of
   cyanogel are prerequisite for the successful fabrication of such
   fascinating hierarchical nanostructures. Due to the unique 3D
   hierarchical structure and the synergistic effect between hybrid
   components, the as-prepared hybrid nanoflowers exhibit a remarkable
   catalytic activity and durability toward the reduction of Rhodamine B
   (RhB) by NaBH4. We expect that the obtained hybrid nanoflowers may hold
   great promises in water remediation field and beyond. Furthermore, the
   facile synthetic strategy presented here for synthesizing functional
   hybrid materials can be extendable for the synthesis of various
   functional hybrid nanomaterials owing to its versatility and
   feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{Manganite (MnOOH) is one of the most effective electrocatalysts for
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and RuO2 nanoparticles exhibit high
   activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report a facile
   means of producing well dispersed RuO2/MnOOH on Ketjen black
   (RuO2/MnOOH/C) as a bifunctional catalyst for lithium-air (Li-air)
   batteries. RuO2/MnOOH/C was simply synthesized using a
   hydrothermal/precipitation based method, and was used as a cathode for a
   Li-air battery using a Swagelok-type cell. The importance of dispersing
   active catalysts on a carbon support was clearly demonstrated by
   textural, charge-discharge voltammetric, and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopic (EIS) analyses, comparing results with a catalyst produced
   by physically mixing RuO2/MnOOH with carbon (RuO2/MnOOH + C).
   RuO2/MnOOH/C showed low overpotential and stable cycleability up to
   170th cycles with 1000 mAh g(-1) of charge-discharge capacity, which was
   attributed to its enhanced active surface area and low charge-transfer
   resistance. The results obtained suggest that this strategy can be
   widely applied to bifunctional electrocatalysis, such as secondary
   batteries and regenerative fuel cell (RFC). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Differential Changes with Age in Multiscale Entropy of Electromyography
   Signals from Leg Muscles during Treadmill Walking}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Age-related gait changes may be due to the loss of complexity in the
   neuromuscular system. This theory is disputed due to inconsistent
   results from single-scale analyses. Also, behavioral adaptations may
   confound these changes. We examined whether EMG dynamics during gait is
   less complex in older adults over a range of timescales using the
   multiscale entropy method, and whether slower walking attenuates this
   effect. Surface EMG was measured from the left vastus lateralis (VL),
   biceps femoris (BF), gastrocnemius (GA), and tibialis anterior (TA) in
   17 young and 18 older adults as they walked on a treadmill for 5 minutes
   at 0.8x-1.2x of preferred speed. Sample entropy (SE) and the complexity
   index (C-I) of the EMG signals were calculated after successive
   coarse-graining to extract dynamics at timescales of 27 to 270 Hz, with
   m = 2 and r = 0.15 SD. SE and C-I were lower across the timescales in
   older adults in VL and BF, but higher in GA (all p<0.001); these results
   held for VL and GA even after accounting for longer EMG burst durations
   in older adults. CI was higher during slower walking speed in VL and BF
   (p<0.001). Results were mostly similar for m = 3 and r = 0.01-0.35.
   Smaller r was more sensitive to age-related differences. The decrease in
   complexity with aging in the timescales studied was limited to proximal
   muscles, particularly VL. The increase in GA may be driven by other
   factors. Walking slower may reflect a behavioral adaptation that allows
   the nervous system to function with greater complexity.}},

Pages = {{8208-8216}},

Abstract = {{We exploit atomically detailed simulations and the milestoning theory to
   extract coarse grained models of membrane kinetics and thermodynamics.
   Non-Markovian and Markovian theories for the phosphate group
   displacements are used to coarsely represent membrane motions. The
   construction of the two models makes it possible to examine their
   consistency and accuracy. The equilibrium and fluctuations of the
   phosphate groups along the normal to the membrane plane are estimated,
   and milestoning equations are constructed and solved. An optimal
   Markovian model is constructed that reproduces exactly the equilibrium
   and mean first passage time (MFPT) of the non-Markovian model. The
   equilibrium solution of both models is favorably compared to
   distributions obtained from straightforward molecular dynamics
   simulations. The picture for the kinetics is complex. Multiple local
   relaxation times of the mass density are illustrated emphasizing the
   non-Markovian characteristics of the process. In Markovian modeling,
   only a single relaxation time is assumed for a state. Mapping of
   particle dynamics to the dynamics of a field density offers a new way of
   coarse graining complex systems as membranes that may bridge between
   atomically detailed models and phenomenological descriptions of
   macroscopic membranes.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, hybrid ion capacitors which combine the characteristics of
   batteries and supercapacitors have gained great interests for
   large-scale energy storage applications. Here, we demonstrated a new
   hybrid sodium ion capacitor configuration, utilizing the niobium
   pentoxide (Nb2O5) and peanut shell carbon (PSC) as the anode and cathode
   materials, respectively. The advanced architecture of self-assembled
   Nb2O5 nanosheets with exceptional sodium ion storage property was
   obtained by carefully controlling reaction kinetics. A key finding is
   that the growth mechanism is demonstrated to be a process from
   one-dimensional nanorods to threedimensional nanocubes, and further to
   two-dimensional nanosheets. The resulting Nb2O5 nanosheets//PSC hybrid
   capacitors deliver an exceptionally high energy density (43.2 Wh kg(-1))
   and high power density (5760 W kg(-1)) based on the active materials,
   with a long and stable cycle life (capacity retention: similar to 80\%

Abstract = {{An amorphous red phosphorus-based composite has been synthesized via a
   facile and simple one-step high-energy mechanical milling process and
   investigated as an anode material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion
   batteries. The resultant P-TiP2-C nanocomposite exhibits a high
   reversible capacity of 1116 mA. h g(-1), excellent cyclability, and a
   remarkable initial Coulombic efficiency of 86\% in lithium half cells.
   Furthermore, it delivers an initial desodiation capacity of 755 mA h
   g(-1) with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 80\% and a good
   capacity retention of 80\% after 100 cycles in sodium half cells. The
   greatly improved electrochemical performance is due to the unique
   nanoarchitecture composed of well-blended red phosphorus and crystalline
   TiP2 homogeneously embedded in a conductive carbon network The presence
   of the conductive TiP2 inclusions plays a crucial role in offering
   structural stability as well as high conductivity to the
   phosphorus-based composite particles during cycling, thereby leading to
   superior cycling stability and rate capability in both lithium-ion and
   sodium-ion batteries compared to the composite without TiP2.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a stochastic system based Bayesian approach is applied to
   quantify the uncertainties involved in the modeling of the HCN/O-2/Ar
   mixture kinetics proposed by Thielen and Roth (1987). This enables more
   robust predictions of quantities of interest such as rate coefficients
   of HCN + Ar -> H + CN + Ar and O-2 + CN -> NCO + O by using a stochastic
   Arrhenius form calibrated against their experimental data. This Bayesian
   approach requires the evaluation of multidimensional integrals, which
   cannot be done analytically. Here a recently developed stochastic
   simulation algorithm, which allows for efficient sampling in the
   high-dimensional parameter space, is used. We quantify the uncertainties
   in the modeling of the HCN/O-2/Ar mixture kinetics and in turn the two
   rate coefficients and the other relevant rate coefficients. The
   uncertainty in the error including both the experimental measurement
   error and physical modeling error is also quantified. The effect of the
   number of uncertain parameters on the uncertainties is investigated. (C)

Title = {{On the formation of equilibrium gels via a macroscopic bond limitation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Restricting the number of attractive physical ``bonds{''} that can form
   between particles in a fluid suppresses the usual demixing phase
   transition to very low particle concentrations, allowing for the
   formation of open, percolated, and homogeneous states, aptly called
   equilibrium or ``empty{''} gels. Most demonstrations of this concept
   have directly limited the microscopic particle valence via anisotropic
   (patchy) attractions; however, an alternative macroscopic valence
   limitation would be desirable for greater experimental tunability and
   responsiveness. One possibility, explored in this paper, is to employ
   primary particles with attractions mediated via a secondary species of
   linking particles. In such a system, the linker-to-primary particle
   ratio serves as a macroscopic control parameter for the average
   microscopic valence. We show that the phase behavior of such a system
   predicted by Wertheim's first order perturbation theory is consistent
   with equilibrium gel formation: the primary particle concentrations
   corresponding to the two-phase demixing transition are significantly
   suppressed at both low and high linker-to-primary particle ratios.
   Extensive molecular dynamics simulations validate these theoretical
   predictions but also reveal the presence of loops of bonded particles,
   which are neglected in the theory. Such loops cause densification and
   inhibit percolation, and hence the range of viable empty gel state
   conditions is somewhat reduced relative to the Wertheim theory
   predictions. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

   Molecular Grafting Mechanism of Single Layer Graphene}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Engineering graphene at the atomic level via chemical doping, substrate
   interactions or lateral confinement opens up avenues for precise tuning
   of its electronic and magnetic properties. Chemical doping by covalent
   modification routes using electrochemical tools offers rich
   opportunities that are yet to be fully explored. The key to controlling
   graphene's physicochemical properties requires a detailed atomistic
   understanding of the geometry and mechanism of the covalent attachment
   process. By employing diaryliodonium salts instead of the commonly used
   diazonium salts, precise molecular grafting onto epitaxial graphene is
   achieved. Using atomically resolved imaging via scanning tunneling
   microscopy it is shown that for single layer, high quality, low defect
   graphene, the functionalization process is controlled by kinetics rather
   than thermodynamics in accord with Marcus-Gerisher theory. The
   predominance of the preferential pairwise attachment of molecular grafts
   specifically on the same graphene sublattice gives rise to ferromagnetic
   properties previously observed in nitrophenyl modified graphene.
   Furthermore, p-type doping has been quantified by electrical
   measurements and angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Overall this
   electrochemical route for precise covalent functionalization of single
   layer graphene is general and can be straightforwardly extended to other
   2D few-layer confined materials such as transition metal chalcogenides.}},

Abstract = {{The drug olsalazine (H(4)olz) was employed as a ligand to synthesize a
   new series of mesoporous metal-organic frameworks that are expanded
   analogues of the well-known M-2(dobdc) materials (dobdc(4-) =
   2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; M-MOF-74). The M-2(olz) frameworks
   (M = Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) exhibit high surface areas with large
   hexagonal pore apertures that are approximately 27 angstrom in diameter.
   Variable temperature H-2 adsorption isotherms revealed strong adsorption
   at the open metal sites, and in situ infrared spectroscopy experiments
   on Mg-2(olz) and Ni-2(olz) were used to determine site-specific H-2
   binding enthalpies. In addition to its capabilities for gas sorption,
   the highly biocompatible Mg-2(olz) framework was also evaluated as a
   platform for the delivery of olsalazine and Other encapsulated
   therapeutics. The Mg-2(olz) material (86 wt \% olsalazine) was shown to
   release the therapeutic linker through dissolution of the framework
   under simulated physiological conditions. Furthermore, Mg-2(olz) was
   used to encapsulate phenethylamine (PEA), a model drug for a broad class
   of bioactive compounds. Under simulated physiological conditions,
   Mg-2(olz)(PEA)(2) disassembled to release PEA from the pores and
   olsalazine from the framework itself; demonstrating that multiple
   therapeutic components can be delivered together at different rates. The
   low toxicity, high surface areas, and coordinatively unsaturated metal
   sites make these M-2(olz) materials promising for a range of potential
   applications, including drug delivery in the treatment of
   gastrointestinal diseases.}},

Title = {{In-vivo heterogeneous functional and residual strains in human aortic
   valve leaflets}},

Abstract = {{Residual and physiological functional strains in soft tissues are known
   to play an important role in modulating organ stress distributions. Yet,
   no known comprehensive information on residual strains exist, or
   non-invasive techniques to quantify in-vivo deformations for the aortic
   valve (AV) leaflets. Herein we present a completely non-invasive
   approach for determining heterogeneous strains - both functional and
   residual - in semilunar valves and apply it to normal human AV leaflets.
   Transesophageal 3D echocardiographic (3DE) images of the AV were
   acquired from open-heart transplant patients, with each AV leaflet
   excised after heart explant and then imaged in a flattened configuration
   ex-vivo. Using an established spline parameterization of both 3DE
   segmentations and digitized ex-vivo images (Aggarwal et al., 2014),
   surface strains were calculated for deformation between the ex-vivo and
   three in-vivo configurations: fully open, just-coapted, and
   fully-loaded. Results indicated that leaflet area increased by an
   average of 20\% from the ex-vivo to in-vivo open states, with a highly
   heterogeneous strain field. The increase in area from open to
   just-coapted state was the highest at an average of 25\%, while that
   from just-coapted to fully-loaded remained almost unaltered. Going from
   the ex-vivo to in-vivo mid-systole configurations, the leaflet area near
   the basal attachment shrank slightly, whereas the free edge expanded by
   similar to 10\%. This was accompanied by a 10 degrees - 20 degrees shear
   along the circumferential-radial direction. Moreover, the principal
   stretches aligned approximately with the circumferential and radial
   directions for all cases, with the highest stretch being along the
   radial direction. Collectively, these results indicated that even though
   the AV did not support any measurable pressure gradient in the
   just-coapted state, the leaflets were significantly pre-strained with
   respect to the excised state. Furthermore, the collagen fibers of the
   leaflet were almost fully recruited in the just-coapted state, making
   the leaflet very stiff with marginal deformation under full pressure.
   Lastly, the deformation was always higher in the radial direction and
   lower along the circumferential one, the latter direction made stiffer
   by the preferential alignment of collagen fibers. These results provide
   significant insight into the distribution of residual strains and the
   in-vivo strains encountered during valve opening and closing in AV
   leaflets, and will form an important component of the tool that can
   evaluate valve's functional properties in a non-invasive manner. (C)

Abstract = {{Fractures that propagate off of weak slip planes are known as wing
   cracks and often play important roles in both tectonic deformation and
   fluid flow across reservoir seals. Previous numerical models have
   produced the basic kinematics of wing crack openings but generally have
   not been able to capture fracture geometries seen in nature. Here we
   present both a phase-field modeling approach and a physical experiment
   using gelatin for a wing crack formation. By treating the fracture
   surfaces as diffusive zones instead of as discontinuities, the
   phase-field model does not require consideration of unpredictable rock
   properties or stress inhomogeneities around crack tips. It is shown by
   benchmarking the models with physical experiments that the numerical
   assumptions in the phase-field approach do not affect the final model
   predictions of wing crack nucleation and growth. With this study, we
   demonstrate that it is feasible to implement the formation of wing
   cracks in large scale phase-field reservoir models.}},

Title = {{Excitation spectra of aromatic molecules within a real-space GW-BSE
   formalism: Role of self-consistency and vertex corrections}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{We present first-principles calculations on the vertical ionization
   potentials (IPs), electron affinities (EAs), and singlet excitation
   energies on an aromatic-molecule test set (benzene, thiophene,
   1,2,5-thiadiazole, naphthalene, benzothiazole, and tetrathiafulvalene)
   within the GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalisms. Our
   computational framework, which employs a real-space basis for
   ground-state and a transition-space basis for excited-state
   calculations, is well suited for high-accuracy calculations on
   molecules, as we show by comparing against G(0)W(0) calculations within
   a plane-wave-basis formalism. We then generalize our framework to test
   variants of the GW approximation that include a local density
   approximation (LDA)-derived vertex function (Gamma(LDA)) and
   quasiparticle-self-consistent (QS) iterations. We find that Gamma(LDA)
   and quasiparticle self-consistency shift IPs and EAs by roughly the same
   magnitude, but with opposite sign for IPs and the same sign for EAs.
   G(0)W(0) and QSGW Gamma(LDA) are more accurate for IPs, while
   G(0)W(0)Gamma(LDA) and QSGW are best for EAs. For optical excitations,
   we find that perturbative GW-BSE underestimates the singlet excitation
   energy, while self-consistent GW-BSE results in good agreement with
   previous best-estimate values for both valence and Rydberg excitations.
   Finally, our work suggests that a hybrid approach, in which G0W0
   energies are used for occupied orbitals and G(0)W(0)Gamma(LDA) for
   unoccupied orbitals, also yields optical excitation energies in good
   agreement with experiment but at a smaller computational cost.}},

Title = {{Fluids with competing interactions. II.Validating a free energy model
   for equilibrium cluster size}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Using computer simulations, we validate a simple free energy model that
   can be analytically solved to predict the equilibrium size of
   self-limiting clusters of particles in the fluid state governed by a
   combination of short-range attractive and long-range repulsive pair
   potentials. The model is a semi-empirical adaptation and extension of
   the canonical free energy-based result due to Groenewold and Kegel
   {[}J.Phys. Chem. B 105, 11702-11709 (2001)], where we use new computer
   simulation data to systematically improve the cluster-size scalings with
   respect to the strengths of the competing interactions driving
   aggregation. We find that one can adapt a classical nucleation like
   theory for small energetically frustrated aggregates provided one
   appropriately accounts for a size-dependent, microscopic energy penalty
   of interface formation, which requires new scaling arguments. This
   framework is verified in part by considering the extensive scaling of
   intracluster bonding, where we uncover a superlinear scaling regime
   distinct from ( and located between) the known regimes for small and
   large aggregates. We validate our model based on comparisons against
   approximately 100 different simulated systems comprising compact
   spherical aggregates with characteristic (terminal) sizes between six
   and sixty monomers, which correspond to wide ranges in experimentally
   controllable parameters.}},

Title = {{Fluids with competing interactions. I. Decoding the structure factor to
   detect and characterize self-limited clustering}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{We use liquid state theory and computer simulations to gain insights
   into the shape of the structure factor for fluids of particles
   interacting via a combination of short-range attractions and long-range
   repulsions. Such systems can reversibly morph between homogeneous phases
   and states comprising compact self-limiting clusters. We first highlight
   trends with respect to the presence and location of the
   intermediate-range order (IRO) pre-peak in the structure factor, which
   is commonly associated with clustering, for wide ranges of the tunable
   parameters that control interparticle interactions (e.g., Debye
   screening length). Next, for approximately 100 different cluster phases
   at various conditions (where aggregates range in size from six to sixty
   monomers), we quantitatively relate the shape of the structure factor to
   physical characteristics including intercluster distance and cluster
   size. We also test two previously postulated criteria for identifying
   the emergence of clustered phases that are based on IRO peak-height
   and-width, respectively. We find that the criterion based on peak-width,
   which encodes the IRO thermal correlation length, is more robust across
   a wide range of conditions and interaction strengths but nonetheless
   approximate. Ultimately, we recommend a hybrid heuristic drawing on both
   pre-peak height and width for positively identifying the emergence of
   clustered states.}},

Title = {{Theoretical modeling and experimental observations of the atomic layer
   deposition of SrO using a cyclopentadienyl Sr precursor}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{First-principle calculations are used to model the adsorption and
   hydration of strontium bis(cyclopentadienyl) {[}Sr(Cp)(2)] on
   TiO2-terminated strontium titanate, SrTiO3 (STO), for the deposition of
   strontium oxide, SrO, by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The Sr(Cp)(2)
   precursor is shown to adsorb on the TiO2-terminated surface, with the Sr
   atom assuming essentially the bulk position in STO. The C-Sr bonds are
   weaker than in the free molecule, with a Ti atom at the surface bonding
   to one of the C atoms in the cyclopentadienyl rings. The surface does
   not need to be hydrogenated for precursor adsorption. The calculations
   are compared with experimental observations for a related Sr
   cyclopentadienyl precursor, strontium bis(triisopropylcyclopentadienyl)
   {[}Sr((Pr3Cp)-Pr-i)(2)], adsorbed on TiO2-terminated STO.
   High-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low-energy ion
   scattering spectroscopy show adsorption of the Sr precursor on the
   TiO2-terminated STO after a single precursor dose. This study suggests
   that ALD growth from the strontium precursors featuring cyclopentadienyl
   ligands, such as Sr(Cp)(2), may initiate film growth on non-hydroxylated
   surfaces. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The volume fraction of red blood cells (RBCs) in a capillary affects the
   degree to which platelets are promoted to marginate to near a vessel
   wall and form blood clots. In this work we investigate the relationship
   between RBC hematocrit and platelet adhesion activity. We perform
   experiments flowing blood samples through a microfluidic channel coated
   with type 1 collagen and observe the rate at which platelets adhere to
   the wall. We compare these results with three-dimensional boundary
   integral simulations of a suspension of RBCs and platelets in a periodic
   channel where platelets can adhere to the wall. In both cases, we find
   that the rate of platelet adhesion varies greatly with the RBC
   hematocrit. We observe that the relative decrease in platelet activity
   as hematocrit falls shows a similar profile for simulation and
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Thin films comprised of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) nanocrystals
   are attractive for a number of optoelectronic applications. However, it
   is often observed that the conductivity of such films is very low when
   they are in contact with air. It has recently been demonstrated,
   somewhat surprisingly, that filling in initially insulating films
   comprised of TCO nanocrystals with another insulator by atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) dramatically increases the conductivity by many orders
   of magnitude. This work aims to elucidate the mechanism by which the ALD
   coating increases conductivity. We examined the effect of removing two
   adsorbed oxygen species (physisorbed molecular water and chemisorbed
   hydroxide) on sheet resistance and compared this result to the results
   with thin films comprised of ZnO nanocrystals coated with Al2O3 and also
   HfO2 by ALD. Although both insulating infills decrease the sheet
   resistance and increase the stability of the films, there is a stark
   discrepancy between the two. From the in situ measurements, it was found
   that coating with Al2O3 removes both physisorbed water and chemisorbed
   hydroxide, resulting in a net reduction of the ZnO nanocrystals. Coating
   with HfO2 removes only physisorbed water, which was confirmed by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy. A similar phenomenon was observed when
   thin films comprised of Sn-doped In2O3 nanocrystals were coated,
   suggesting Al2O3 can be used to reduce and stabilize metal oxide
   nanocrystals in general.}},

Title = {{Designing convex repulsive pair potentials that favor assembly of kagome
   and snub square lattices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Building on a recently introduced inverse strategy, isotropic and convex
   repulsive pair potentials were designed that favor assembly of particles
   into kagome and equilateral snub square lattices. The former
   interactions were obtained by a numerical solution of a variational
   problem that maximizes the range of density for which the ground state
   of the potential is the kagome lattice. Similar optimizations targeting
   the snub square lattice were also carried out, employing a constraint
   that required a minimum chemical potential advantage of the target over
   select competing structures. This constraint helped to discover
   isotropic interactions that meaningfully favored the snub square lattice
   as the ground state structure despite the asymmetric spatial
   distribution of particles in its coordination shells and the presence of
   tightly competing structures. Consistent with earlier published results
   {[}W. Pineros et al., J. Chem. Phys. 144, 084502 (2016)], enforcement of
   greater chemical potential advantages for the target lattice in the
   interaction optimization led to assemblies with enhanced thermal
   stability. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{What is the thermal conductivity limit of silicon germanium alloys?}},

Pages = {{19544-19548}},

Abstract = {{The lowest possible thermal conductivity of silicon-germanium (SiGe)
   bulk alloys achievable through alloy scattering, or the so-called alloy
   limit, is important to identify for thermoelectric applications.
   However, this limit remains a subject of contention as both
   experimentally-reported and theoretically-predicted values tend to be
   widely scattered and inconclusive. In this work, we present a possible
   explanation for these discrepancies by demonstrating that the thermal
   conductivity can vary significantly depending on the degree of
   randomness in the spatial arrangement of the constituent atoms. Our
   study suggests that the available experimental data, obtained from alloy
   samples synthesized using ball-milling techniques, and previous
   first-principles calculations, restricted by small supercell sizes, may
   not have accessed the alloy limit. We find that low-frequency anharmonic
   phonon modes can persist unless the spatial distribution of Si and Ge
   atoms is completely random at the atomic scale, in which case the lowest
   possible thermal conductivity may be achieved. Our theoretical analysis
   predicts that the alloy limit of SiGe could be around 1-2 W m(-1) K-1
   with an optimal composition around 25 at\% Ge, which is substantially
   lower than previously reported values from experiments and
   first-principles calculations.}},

Title = {{Effect of polydopamine deposition conditions on polysulfone
   ultrafiltration membrane properties and threshold flux during oil/water
   emulsion filtration}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{247-257}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Surface modification of porous membranes for water filtration has been
   extensively reported in the literature to improve fouling resistance.
   However, surface modification can significantly change the membrane
   filtration properties, sometimes resulting in more severe fouling than
   with the original, unmodified membrane. This study focused on
   demonstrating surface modification strategies and membrane comparison
   strategies to better understand the complex, competing phenomena
   occurring when membranes are surface modified. Polysulfone
   ultrafiltration membranes were modified with polydopamine (PDA) at
   different initial dopamine concentrations and deposition times. Membrane
   properties, including surface hydrophilicity, roughness, and zeta
   potential, were characterized. PDA coatings significantly increased
   surface hydrophilicity, but they did not markedly change the surface
   roughness or zeta potential. The threshold flux during oil/water
   emulsion filtration was determined and used as a fouling parameter for
   membranes modified with PDA at various modification conditions. The
   threshold flux increased when PDA was deposited at low initial dopamine
   concentrations or short coating times. However, PDA deposition at high
   initial dopamine concentrations or long coating times decreased the
   threshold flux, suggesting that a tradeoff exists between increased
   hydrophilicity and reduced pore size due to surface modification. An
   increase in membrane surface hydrophilicity was observed at all PDA
   deposition conditions, which tends to reduce foulant adhesion and
   increase threshold flux. However, extensive PDA coating significantly
   decreased membrane pure water permeance, suggesting that some membrane
   pores may have been narrowed or blocked, increasing local permeate flux
   through the remaining pores in the PDA-modified membranes. This higher
   local flux would exacerbate fouling and decrease threshold flux.
   Comparing unmodified and PDA-modified membranes having similar pure
   water permeance values, the PDA-modified membranes had higher threshold
   fluxes than the unmodified membranes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To date, decoding accuracy of actual or imagined pointing movements to
   targets in 3D space from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals has
   remained modest. The reason may pertain to the fact that these movements
   activate essentially the same neural networks. In this study, we aimed
   at testing whether repetitive pointing movements to each of the targets
   promotes the development of segregated neural patterns, resulting in
   enhanced decoding accuracy. Six human subjects generated slow or fast
   repetitive pointing movements with their right dominant arm to one of
   five targets distributed in 3D space, followed by repetitive imagery of
   movements to the same target or to a different target. Nine naive
   subjects generated both repetitive and non-repetitive slow actual
   movements to each of the five targets to test the effect of block design
   on decoding accuracy. In order to assure that base line drift and low
   frequency motion artifacts do not contaminate the data, the data were
   high-pass filtered in 4-30 Hz, leaving out the delta and gamma band. For
   the repetitive trials, the model decoded target location with 81\%
   accuracy, which is significantly higher than chance level. The average
   decoding rate of target location was only 30\% for the non-repetitive
   trials, which is not significantly different than chance level. A subset
   of electrodes, mainly over the contralateral sensorimotor areas, was
   found to provide most of the discriminative features for all tested
   conditions. Time proximity between trained and tested blocks was found
   to enhance decoding accuracy of target location both by target
   non-specific and specific mechanisms. Our findings suggest that movement
   repetition promotes the development of distinct neural patterns,
   presumably by the formation of target-specific kinesthetic memory. (C)

Abstract = {{The design of surfactants for stabilizing CO2-in-water (brine) (C/W)
   foams at high temperature is challenging given the low density (solvent
   strength) of CO2, limited surfactant solubility in brine, and a lack of
   knowledge of the interfacial and rheological properties. Herein, the
   tail length of trimethylammonium cationic surfactants was optimized to
   provide the desired phase behavior and interfacial properties for
   formation and stabilization of the C/W foams. The headgroup was properly
   balanced with a C12-14 hydrocarbon tail to achieve aqueous solubility in
   22\% total dissolved solids (TDS) brine up to 393 K (120 degrees C)
   along with high surfactant adsorption (area/surfactant molecule of 154
   angstrom(2)) at the CO, water (C-W) interface which reduced the
   interfacial tension from similar to 40 mN/m to similar to 6 mN/m. For
   C12-14N(CH3)(3)Cl, these properties enabled stabilization of a C/W foam
   with an apparent viscosity of 14 mPa.s at 393 K in both a crushed
   calcium carbonate packed bed (75 mu m(2) or 76 Darcy) and a capillary
   tube downstream of the bed. In addition, the partition coefficient of
   the surfactant between oil and 22\% TDS (255 kg/m(3)) brine was less
   than 0.15, which would be beneficial for minimizing the loss of the
   surfactant to an oil phase in applications including enhanced oil
   recovery and hydraulic fracturing.}},

Abstract = {{Single-well-partitioning-tracer tests (SWTTs) are used to measure the
   saturation of oil or water near a wellbore. If used before and after
   injection of enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) fluids, they can evaluate EOR
   flood performance in a so-called one-spot pilot. Four
   alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) one-spot pilots were recently
   completed in Kuwait's Sabriyah-Mauddud (SAMA) reservoir, a thick,
   heterogeneous carbonate operated by Kuwait Oil Company (KOC). UTCHEM
   (Delshad et al. 2013), the University of Texas chemical-flooding
   reservoir simulator, was used to interpret results of two of these
   one-spot pilots performed in an unconfined zone within the thick SAMA
   formation. These simulations were used to design a new method for
   injecting partitioning tracers for one-spot pilots. The recommended
   practice is to inject the tracers into a relatively uniform confined
   zone, but, as seen in this work, that is not always possible, so an
   alternative design was needed to improve the accuracy of the test.
   The simulations showed that there was a flow-conformance problem when
   the partitioning tracers were injected into a perforated zone without
   confinement after the viscous ASP and polymer- drive solutions. The
   water-conveyed-tracer solutions were being partially diverted outside of
   the ASP-swept zone where they contacted unswept oil. Because of this
   problem, the initial interpretation of the performance of the chemicals
   was pessimistic, overestimating the chemical residual oil saturation
   (ROS) by up to 12 saturation units. Additional simulations indicated
   that the oil saturation in the ASP-swept zone could be properly
   estimated by avoiding the post-ASP waterflood and injecting the post-ASP
   tracers in a viscous polymer solution rather than in water. An ASP
   one-spot pilot using the new SWTT design resulted in an estimated ROS of
   only 0.06 after injection of chemicals (Carlisle et al. 2014). These
   saturation values were obtained by history matching tracer-production
   data by use of both traditional continuously- stirred-tank (CSTR) models
   and compositional, reactive-transport reservoir models.
   The ability of the simulator to model every phase of the one-spot pilot
   operation was crucial to the insight of modified SWTT design. The
   waterflood, first SWTT, ASP flood, and the final SWTT were simulated
   using a heterogeneous permeability field representative of the Mauddud
   formation. Laboratory data, field-ASP quality-control information, and
   injection strategy were all accounted for in these simulations. We
   describe the models, how they were used, and how the results were used
   to modify the SWTT design. We further discuss the implications for other
   SWTTs.
   The advantage of mechanistic simulation of multiple aspects of a
   one-spot pilot is an important theme of this study. Because the pore
   space investigated by the SWTTs can be affected by the previously
   injected EOR fluids (and vice versa), these interactions should be
   accounted for. This simulation approach can be used to identify and
   mitigate design problems during each phase of a challenging one-spot
   pilot.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes a general four-phase model developed for
   gas/oil/water/microemulsion (ME) coexisting at local equilibrium. The
   original framework of a chemical reservoir simulator is used to
   implement the model. This model represents a new method to couple the
   black-oil model with surfactant-phase behavior {[}i.e., the Hand (1939)
   rule]. The Hand (1939) rule is used to capture the equilibrium among
   surfactant, oil, and water species as a function of salinity and species
   concentrations for oil/water/ME phases. The interphase-mass transfer
   between gas/oil in the presence of the ME phase is calculated at the
   equilibrium between phases. For this purpose, a new volume-balance
   equation is derived to consider the pressure equation for compressible
   and real mixing in such a model. Hence, the pressure equation is derived
   by extending the black-oil model to a pseudocompositional model for a
   wide range of components (water, oil, surfactant, polymer, anion,
   cation, alcohol, and gas). Mass-balance equations are then solved for
   the components to calculate the concentration. Finally, we implemented
   the coupled surfactant and black-oil phase-behavior models and the
   fluid-flow formulations in an implicit-pressure/explicit-concentration
   (IMPEC) chemical-flooding simulator: UTCHEM (2011) four-phase.
   The results were verified against existing reservoir simulators for two
   different three-phase test cases comprising gas/oil/water and
   oil/water/ME. Then, the performance of the model in the presence of four
   phases was tested and validated against coreflood experimental data. The
   results showed that the new phase behavior and the fluid-flow equations
   are consistent with three-phase reservoir simulators for the case
   studies.
   In addition, the findings of this work can be used to model and capture
   the mechanisms behind processes such as micellar slug foam and alkaline
   and surfactant flooding into saturated (gas cap) reservoirs as well as
   alternating or coinjection of surfactant and gas processes. Modeling of
   such processes is far from satisfactory in existing phase behavior and
   fluid-flow simulators.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to systematically study the effect of
   wettability alteration and foaming, either acting individually or
   synergistically, on tertiary oil recovery in oil-wet carbonate cores.
   Three types of anionic-surfactant formulations were used: alkyl propoxy
   sulfate (APS), which exhibited low interfacial tension (IFT),
   wettability alteration, and weak foaming; alpha-olefin sulfonate (AOS),
   which showed no wettability alteration but good foaming; and a blend of
   APS, AOS, and a zwitterionic-foam booster, which showed low IFT,
   wettability alteration, and good foaming. First, contact-angle
   experiments were conducted on oil-wet calcite plates to evaluate their
   wettability-altering capabilities. Second, spontaneous imbibitions in a
   microchannel were performed to study the role of IFT reduction and
   wettability alteration by these formulations. Third, static foam tests
   were conducted to evaluate their foaming performance in bulk. Fourth,
   foam-flow experiments were conducted in cores to evaluate potential
   synergism between the anionic-surfactant AOS and the zwitterionic
   surfactants in stabilizing foam in the absence of crude oil. Finally,
   oil-displacement experiments were performed by use of a vuggy, oil-wet,
   dolomite core saturated with a crude oil. After secondary waterfloods,
   surfactant solutions were coinjected with methane gas at a fixed foam
   quality (gas-volume fraction). Contact-angle and spontaneous-imbibition
   experiments showed that AOS can act as a wettability-altering surfactant
   in the presence of sodium carbonate, but not alone. No synergy was
   observed in foam stabilization by means of the blend of zwitterionic
   surfactant and AOS solution (1: 1) in a water-wet carbonate core.
   Oil-displacement experiments in oil-wet carbonate core revealed that
   coinjection of wettability-altering surfactant and gas can recover a
   significant amount of oil {[}33\% original oil in place (OOIP)] over
   waterflood. During foam flooding, with AOS as the foaming agent, only a
   weak foam was propagated in a carbonate core, irrespective of the core
   wettability. A blend of wettability-altering surfactant, AOS, and
   zwitterionic surfactant not only altered the wettability of carbonate
   core from oil-wet to water-wet, but also significantly increased the
   foam-pressure gradient in the presence of crude oil.}},

Abstract = {{The low viscosity and density of carbon dioxide (CO2) usually result in
   the poor sweep efficiency in CO2-flooding processes, especially in
   heterogeneous formations. Foam is a promising method to control the
   mobility and thus reduce the CO2 bypass because of the gravity override
   and heterogeneity of formations. A switchable surfactant, Ethomeen C12,
   has been reported as an effective CO2-foaming agent in a sandpack with
   low adsorption on pure-carbonate minerals. Here, the low mobility of
   Ethomeen C12/CO2 foam at high temperature (120 degrees C), high pressure
   (3,400 psi), and high salinity {[}22 wt\% of total dissolved solids
   (TDS)] was demonstrated in Silurian dolomite cores and in a wide range
   of foam qualities. The influence of various parameters, including
   aqueous solubility, thermal and chemical stability, flow rate, foam
   quality, salinity, temperature, and minimum-pressure gradient (MPG), on
   CO2 foam was discussed. A local-equilibrium foam model, the dry-out foam
   model, was used to fit the experimental data for reservoir simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer flooding is one of the most widely used chemical
   enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) methods because of its simplicity and low
   cost. To achieve high oil recoveries, large quantities of polymer
   solution are often injected through a small wellbore. Sometimes, the
   economic success of the project is only feasible when injection rate is
   high for high-viscosity solution. However, injection of viscous polymer
   solutions has been a concern for the field application of polymer
   flooding.
   The pressure increase in polymer injectors can be attributed to
   (1) formation of an oil bank, (2) polymer rheology (shear-thickening
   behavior near wellbore), and (3) plugging of the reservoir pores by
   insoluble polymer molecules or suspended particles in the water.
   In this paper, a new model to history match field injection-rate/
   pressure data is proposed. The pertinent equations for deep-bed
   filtration and external-cake buildup in radial coordinates were coupled
   to the viscoelastic polymer rheology to capture important mechanisms.
   Radial coordinates were selected to minimize the velocity/shear-rate
   errors caused by gridblock size in the Cartesian coordinates.
   The filtration theory was used and the field data history matched
   successfully. Systematic simulations were performed, and the impact of
   adsorption (retention), shear thickening, deep-bed filtration, and
   external-cake formation was investigated to explain the well-injectivity
   behavior of polymer. The simulation results indicate that the gradual
   increase in bottomhole pressure (BHP) during early times is attributed
   to the shear-thickening rheology at high velocities experienced by
   viscoelastic hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymers around the
   wellbore and the permeability reduction caused by polymer adsorption and
   internal filtration of undissolved polymer. However, the linear
   impedance during external-cake growth is responsible for the sharper
   increase in injection pressure at the later times.
   One can use the proposed model to calculate the injectivity of the
   polymer-injection wells, understand the contribution of different
   phenomena to the pressure rise in the wells, locate the plugging or
   damage that may be caused by polymer, and accordingly design the
   chemical stimulation if necessary.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a hydraulic-fracturing simulator that implicitly couples
   fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation in large,
   complex, 3D discrete-fracture networks (DFNs). The code is efficient
   enough to perform field-scale simulations of hydraulic fracturing in
   DFNs containing thousands of fractures, without relying on
   distributed-memory parallelization. The simulator can describe
   propagation of hydraulic fractures and opening and shear stimulation of
   natural fractures. Fracture elements can open or slide, depending on
   their stress state, fluid pressure, and mechanical properties. Fracture
   sliding occurs in the direction of maximum resolved shear stress.
   Nonlinear empirical equations are used to relate normal stress, fracture
   opening, and fracture sliding to fracture aperture and transmissivity.
   Fluid leakoff is treated with a semianalytical 1D leakoff model that
   accounts for changing pressure in the fracture over time. Fracture
   propagation is modeled with linear-elastic fracture mechanics. The
   Forchheimer equation (Forchheimer 1901) is used to simulate nonDarcy
   pressure drop in the fractures because of high flow rate. A crossing
   criterion is implemented that predicts whether propagating hydraulic
   fractures will cross natural fractures or terminate against them,
   depending on orientation and stress anisotropy. Height containment of
   propagating hydraulic fractures between bedding layers can be modeled
   with a vertically heterogeneous stress field or by explicitly imposing
   hydraulic-fracture-height containment as a model assumption. Limitations
   of the model are that all fractures must be vertical; the mechanical
   calculations assume a linearly elastic and homogeneous medium; proppant
   transport is not included; and the locations of potentially forming
   hydraulic fractures must be specified in advance. Simulations were
   performed of a single propagating hydraulic fracture with and without
   leakoff to validate the code against classical analytical solutions.
   Field-scale simulations were performed of hydraulic fracturing in a
   densely naturally fractured formation. The simulations demonstrate how
   interaction with natural fractures in the formation can help explain the
   high net pressures, relatively short fracture lengths, and broad regions
   of microseismicity that are often observed in the field during
   stimulation in low-permeability formations, and that are not predicted
   by classical hydraulic-fracturing models. Depending on input parameters,
   our simulations predicted a variety of stimulation behaviors, from long
   hydraulic fractures with minimal leakoff into surrounding fractures to
   broad regions of dense fracturing with a branching network of many
   natural and newly formed fractures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the fracture-compliance method, a technique
   for estimating the closure pressure from diagnostic fractureinjection
   tests (DFITs). The method is based on the observation that fractures
   retain a finite aperture after asperities come into contact (mechanical
   closure). An empirical, nonlinear joint-closure law is used to relate
   the after-closure fracture aperture and stiffness (the reciprocal of
   compliance) to effective normal stress. Fracture closure increases
   fracture stiffness, which, in low-permeability formations, causes an
   increase in the pressure derivative. On the basis of these insights, we
   propose the fracture-compliance method, which consists of picking
   closure at the first point of deviation from linearity on a plot of
   pressure or G x dP/dG vs. G-time (after the end of the very-early-time
   transient associated with wellbore and near-wellbore friction and
   fracture tip-extension). The contribution of this paper is to provide
   theoretical justification for why closure is best picked with the
   fracture-compliance method, and not with other widely used methods. We
   provide a series of numerical DFIT simulations to demonstrate the
   sensitivity of the pressure transient to input parameters. Governing
   equations are derived and used to demonstrate the effect of changing
   fracture aperture after closure. A field DFIT data set is analyzed with
   the new method. Finally, a field example is presented in which downhole
   tiltmeter measurements provide an independent estimate of the minimum
   principal stress.}},

Title = {{Directional-Permeability Assessment in Formations With Complex Pore
   Geometry With a New Nuclear-Magnetic-Resonance-Based Permeability Model}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new method for directional-permeability assessment
   with nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements. Conventional
   techniques for permeability assessment from NMR measurements include
   empirical correlations such as SDR (Schlumberger-Doll-Research) and
   Coates models. However, carbonate rocks are known for lack of good
   correlations between pore-body-size and pore-throat-size, which makes it
   challenging and often unreliable to estimate permeability from NMR T2
   (spinspin relaxation time) distribution in carbonate formations with
   complex pore structure. It also was proposed that conventional
   permeability models can be improved by incorporating an estimated
   pore-connectivity factor. However, none of the previously introduced
   techniques reflects the anisotropic characteristics of rock
   permeability.
   The new NMR-based directional-permeability model, introduced in this
   paper, incorporates a directional pore-connectivity factor into a
   conventional NMR-based permeability model. We introduce two approaches
   to quantify the directional pore-network connectivity of rock samples
   with pore-scale images. The first approach calculates directional pore
   connectivity in 3D pore-scale images with a topological technique. The
   second approach combines image analysis and electrical formation factor.
   The new NMR-based permeability model enables assessment of rock
   permeability in any desired direction.
   We successfully calibrated and tested the introduced NMRbased
   permeability model on carbonate, sandstone, and sandpack samples with
   complex pore geometry or anisotropic permeability. The anisotropic
   permeability used for calibration and test purposes was obtained by the
   lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) simulations on microcomputed tomography
   (CT) images of rock samples. The comparison between the permeability
   estimates with our new NMR model and conventional NMR models (e. g., SDR
   and Coates models) demonstrated that the NMR-based
   directional-permeability model significantly improves assessment of rock
   permeability, by reflecting rock's anisotropic characteristics and
   minimizing calibration efforts. The outcomes of this research can
   significantly improve permeability assessment in complex carbonate
   reservoirs and anisotropic sandstone reservoirs, and can be extended
   further to organic-rich mudrock formations.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we describe a protocol to perform long-term co-culture of
   multi-species human gut microbiome with microengineered intestinal villi
   in a human gut-on-a-chip microphysiological device. We recapitulate the
   intestinal lumen-capillary tissue interface in a microfluidic device,
   where physiological mechanical deformations and fluid shear flow are
   constantly applied to mimic peristalsis. In the lumen microchannel,
   human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells are cultured to form a
   `germ-free' villus epithelium and regenerate small intestinal villi.
   Pre-cultured microbial cells are inoculated into the lumen side to
   establish a host-microbe ecosystem. After microbial cells adhere to the
   apical surface of the villi, fluid flow and mechanical deformations are
   resumed to produce a steady-state microenvironment in which fresh
   culture medium is constantly supplied and unbound bacteria ( as well as
   bacterial wastes) are continuously removed. After extended co-culture
   from days to weeks, multiple microcolonies are found to be randomly
   located between the villi, and both microbial and epithelial cells
   remain viable and functional for at least one week in culture. Our
   co-culture protocol can be adapted to provide a versatile platform for
   other host-microbiome ecosystems that can be found in various human
   organs, which may facilitate in vitro study of the role of human
   microbiome in orchestrating health and disease.}},

Abstract = {{A new cloaking mechanism, which makes enclosed objects invisible to
   diffusive photon density waves, is proposed. First, diffusive scattering
   from a basic core-shell geometry, which represents the cloaked

   quasi-static scattering regime are derived. These allow for tailoring
   the diffusivity constant of the shell enclosing the object so that the
   fields scattered from the shell and the object cancel each other. This
   means that the photon flow outside the cloak behaves as if the cloaked
   object were not present. Diffusive light invisibility may have potential
   applications in hiding hot spots in infrared thermography or tissue
   imaging.}},

   SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{472}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{An approximate homogenization technique is presented for generally
   anisotropic elastic metamaterials consisting of an elastic host material
   containing randomly distributed heterogeneities displaying
   frequency-dependent material properties. The dynamic response may arise
   from relaxation processes such as viscoelasticity or from dynamic
   microstructure. A Green's function approach is used to model elastic
   inhomogeneities embedded within a uniform elastic matrix as force
   sources that are excited by a time-varying, spatially uniform
   displacement field. Assuming dynamic subwavelength inhomogeneities only
   interact through their volume-averaged fields implies the macroscopic
   stress and momentum density fields are functions of both the microscopic
   strain and velocity fields, and may be related to the macroscopic strain
   and velocity fields through localization tensors. The macroscopic and
   microscopic fields are combined to yield a homogenization scheme that
   predicts the local effective stiffness, density and coupling tensors for
   an effective Willis-type constitutive equation. It is shown that when
   internal degrees of freedom of the inhomogeneities are present,
   Willis-type coupling becomes necessary on the macroscale. To demonstrate
   the utility of the homogenization technique, the effective properties of
   an isotropic elastic matrix material containing isotropic and
   anisotropic spherical inhomogeneities, isotropic spheroidal
   inhomogeneities and isotropic dynamic spherical inhomogeneities are
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of rock mechanical properties in organic-rich mudrocks is
   challenging because of their heterogeneity, anisotropy, and complex
   lithology. Hence, geomechanical analysis should include a complete
   definition of the anisotropic elastic stiffness coefficients for stress
   prediction. Furthermore, typical assumptions made for poroelastic
   parameters, such as assuming that Biot's parameter is equal to one, can
   result in unreliable geomechanical evaluation for stress prediction and
   failure in completion design. Our objectives included estimating (1)
   anisotropic elastic properties and (2) anisotropic poroelastic
   parameters and minimum horizontal stresses, using laboratory
   measurements and well logs, in organic-rich mudrocks with different
   levels of mechanical anisotropy and vertical heterogeneity. We have
   performed mechanical tests on core plugs and obtained correlations
   between the dynamic and static elastic stiffness coefficients. We have
   analyzed advanced acoustic well logs, as well as laboratory
   geomechanical measurements, to estimate dynamic elastic stiffness
   coefficients of the formations under investigation. The estimates of
   mineral composition, in conjunction with the estimates of elastic
   stiffness coefficients, yielded the anisotropic poroelastic parameters.
   Finally, we have estimated the stress profile under the assumption of
   transverse isotropy. We have quantified the impact of anisotropic
   elastic rock properties and poroelastic parameters on stress prediction
   in the lower Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and upper Wolfcamp Formations. The
   estimated minimum horizontal stress gradient, assuming anisotropic
   elastic properties and anisotropic poroelastic parameters, varied by
   approximately 30\% (relative difference) compared with the case in which
   these parameters were assumed to be equal to one. This variation
   decreased to approximately 15\% and 6\% when the poroelastic parameters
   were assumed to be equal to 0.7 in formations with high and relatively
   low levels of heterogeneity and mechanical anisotropy, respectively. The
   results confirmed that transversely isotropic media require a thorough
   depth-by-depth estimation of anisotropic poroelastic parameters to
   estimate stress profile accurately. We have also determined the
   importance of integrated interpretation of petrophysical, compositional,
   and mechanical properties in geomechanical evaluation in organic-rich
   mudrocks.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Traditional metrics for evaluating the severity of psoriasis
   are subjective, which complicates efforts to measure effective
   treatments in clinical trials.
   Methods: We collected images of psoriasis plaques and calibrated the
   coloration of the images according to an included color card. Features
   were extracted from the images and used to train a linear discriminant
   analysis classifier with cross-validation to automatically classify the
   degree of erythema. The results were tested against numerical scores
   obtained by a panel of dermatologists using a standard rating system.
   Results: Quantitative measures of erythema based on the digital color
   images showed good agreement with subjective assessment of erythema
   severity (kappa = 0.4203). The color calibration process improved the
   agreement from kappa = 0.2364 to kappa = 0.4203.
   Conclusion: We propose a method for the objective measurement of the
   psoriasis severity parameter of erythema and show that the calibration
   process improved the results.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) nanocrystals are relatively strong light emitters, but are
   weak light absorbers as a result of their indirect band gap. One way to
   enhance light absorption is to functionalize the nanocrystals with
   chromophores that are strong light absorbers. By designing systems that
   enable efficient energy transfer from the chromophore to the Si
   nanocrystal, the brightness of the nanocrystals can be significantly
   increased. There have now been a few experimental systems in which
   covalent attachment of chromophores, efficient energy transfer and
   significantly increased brightness have been demonstrated. This review

Abstract = {{This paper provides an overview of the various field trials performed by
   the US Federal Highway Administration aimed at mitigating the effects of
   alkali-silica reaction on highway concrete elements, including
   pavements, bridges and barriers. The different methods used to attempt
   to reduce the expansion and cracking of affected concrete are described,
   including the use of sealings and coatings, the application of lithium
   nitrate and the application of external confinement. The field trials
   were conducted and monitored between 2005 and 2014, and the overall
   findings from each trial are briefly summarised. The use of silane
   products was found to be the most effective means of reducing the
   expansion and cracking due to alkali-silica reaction, with the most
   significant improvement seen in highway barriers. Topical and vacuum
   application of lithium compounds showed little or no benefit in reducing
   expansion and cracking, mainly due to the lack of lithium penetration.
   Electrochemical application of lithium nitrate was more effective in
   driving the lithium into the affected concrete, but had a negligible
   impact on the expansion and cracking induced by alkali-silica reaction.
   Owing to the limited time that was available to monitor most of the
   field trials, future monitoring is essential to delineate the efficacy
   of the various treatments.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the elastic anisotropy of porcine corneas at
   different intraocular pressures (IOPs) using a noncontact optical
   coherence elastography (OCE) technique.
   METHODS: A focused air-pulse induced low amplitude (<= 10 mu m) elastic
   waves in fresh porcine corneas (n = 7) in situ in the whole eye globe
   configuration. A home-built phase-stabilized swept source optical
   coherence elastography (PhS-SSOCE) system imaged the elastic wave
   propagation at different stepped radial directions. A closed-loop
   feedback system was used to artificially control the IOP and the OCE
   measurements were repeated as the IOP was incrementally increased from
   15 to 30 mm Hg in 5-mm Hg increments.
   RESULTS: The OCE measurements demonstrated that the stiffness of the
   cornea increased as a function of IOP and elastic anisotropy of the
   cornea became more pronounced at higher IOPs. The standard deviation of
   the modified planar anisotropy coefficient increased from 0.72 +/- 0.42
   at an IOP of 15 mm Hg to 1.58 +/- 0.40 at 30 mm Hg.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presented noncontact OCE method was capable of
   detecting and assessing the corneal elastic anisotropy as a function of
   IOP. Due to the noninvasive nature and small amplitude of the elastic
   wave, this method may be able to provide further information about
   corneal health and integrity in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Fast capacity degradation and low sulfur loading hamper lithium-sulfur
   batteries from practical application. We present here a flexible and
   robust paper electrode consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and
   activated carbon nanofibers (ACNF) loaded with MnO2 nanosheets to serve
   as an efficient sulfur host for Li/dissolved polysulfide batteries. This
   integrally-designed flexible host facilitates high sulfur loading,
   improves sulfur utilization, and suppresses effectively the parasitic
   shuttle. Accordingly, the Li/dissolved polysulfide cells with high
   sulfur loading exhibit a high-rate capacity of 780 mAh g(-1) at 2 C rate
   and a high capacity retention of 64\% over 300 cycles, demonstrating
   great promise for practical applications of Li-S batteries. In addition,
   a stable lithium-metal anode resulting from the suppressed shuttle
   effect is also proved to contribute significantly to the promising
   cycling performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Contact with cardiac tissue is an important determinant of
   lesion efficacy during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. The Sensei X
   (TM) robotic navigation system (RNS) (Hansen Medical, Mountain View, CA,
   USA) has been validated for contact force (CF) sensing expressed in
   grams (g). The Thermocool (R) SmartTouch (TM) catheter enables the
   measurement of catheter tip CF and direction inside the heart. We aimed
   to investigate the catheter CF with and without RNS during pulmonary
   vein isolation (PVI) procedures.
   Methods Eighty patients with symptomatic AF (56 males, age 63 +/- 18)
   were enrolled in this study. Fifty-seven patients had paroxysmal AF and
   23 early persistent AF. All procedures were performed with the
   Thermocool (R) SmartTouch (TM) ablation catheter. Forty patients were
   randomized to perform PVI with the Sensei X (TM) RNS (group 1), while in
   the other 40 patients (group 2), PVI was performed without the RNS.
   Results AF ablation was performed successfully in all patients without
   complications, while contact force was kept in the established 10-40 g
   range. A significantly higher CF was documented on the PVs in group 1
   compared to group 2. The 1-year freedom from AF recurrence was higher in
   group 1 compared to group 2 (90 vs. 65 \%, p = 0.04). Moreover, a
   significant reduction of fluoroscopy time was noted in the RNS group (13
   +/- 10 vs. 20 +/- 10 min, respectively, p= 0.05).
   Conclusions The Sensei X (TM) RNS permits a significantly higher CF
   during transcatheter AF ablation with a low rate of AF recurrence at
   clinical follow-up.}},

   images provide revealing geometrical insight into the blade scattering
   phenomenology which is not as apparent in either the range profile or

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a discrete element model (DEM) is developed and
   implemented in the open source flow solver MFiX to simulate the
   effective thermal conductivity of powder beds for selective laser
   sintering (SLS) applications, considering scenarios common in SLS such
   as thin beds, high temperatures, and degrees of powder consolidation.
   Random particle packing structures of spherical particles are generated
   and heat transfer between the particles is calculated. A
   particle-particle contact conduction model, a particle-fluid-particle
   conduction model, and a view factor radiation model using ray-tracing
   for calculation of view factors and assuming optically thick particles
   are used. A nonlinear solver is used to solve for the particle
   temperatures that drive the net heat transfer to zero for a steady state
   solution. The effective thermal conductivity is then calculated from the
   steady state temperature distribution. Results are compared against
   previously published experimental measurements for powder beds and good
   agreement is obtained. Results are developed for the impacts of very
   high temperatures, finite bed depth, consolidation, Young's modulus,
   emissivity, gas conductivity, and polydispersity on effective thermal
   conductivity. Emphasis is placed on uncertainty quantification in the
   predicted thermal conductivity resulting from uncertain inputs. This
   allows SLS practitioners to control the inputs to which the thermal
   response of the process is most sensitive.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of PDC bit ROP models and the effect of rock strength on
   model coefficients}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Current low oil price conditions have renewed the emphasis on drilling
   optimization, in order to save time drilling oil and gas wells and
   reduce operational costs. Rate of penetration (ROP) modeling is a key
   tool in optimizing drilling parameters, namely bit weight and rotary
   speed, for faster drilling processes. With a novel, all-automated data
   visualization and ROP modeling tool developed in Excel VBA, ROP-Plotter,
   this work investigates model performance and the impact of rock strength
   on model coefficients of two different PDC bit ROP models: Hareland and
   Rampersad (1994) and Motahhari et at (2010). These two PDC bit models
   are compared against a base case, general ROP relation developed by
   Bingham (1964) in three different sandstone formations in the vertical
   section of a Bakken shale horizontal well. For the first time, an
   attempt has been made to isolate the effect of varying rock strength on
   ROP model coefficients by investigating lithologies with otherwise
   similar drilling parameters. Additionally, a comprehensive discussion on
   the importance of selecting appropriate model coefficients bounds is
   conducted. Rock strength, accounted for in Hareland's and Motahhari's
   models but not in Bingham's, results in higher values of constant
   multiplier model coefficients for the former models, in addition to an
   increased RPM term exponent for Motahhari's model. Hareland and
   Rampersad's model is shown to perform best out of the three models with
   this particular dataset. The effectiveness and applicability of
   traditional ROP modeling is brought to question, as such models rely on
   a set of empirical coefficients that incorporate the effect of many
   drilling factors not accounted for in the model's formulation and are
   unique to a particular lithology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Static formation temperature (SFT) is required to determine the
   thermophysical properties and production parameters in geothermal and
   oil reservoirs. However, it is not easy to determine SFT by both
   experimental and physical methods. In this paper, a mathematical
   approach to predicting SFT, based on a new model describing the
   relationship between bottom hole temperature (BHT) and shut-in time, has
   been proposed. The unknown coefficients of the model were derived from
   the least squares fit by the particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithm. Additionally, the ability to predict SFT using a few BHT data
   points (such as the first three, four, or five points of a data set) was
   evaluated. The accuracy of the proposed method to predict SFT was
   confirmed by a deviation percentage less than +/- 4\% and a high
   regression coefficient R-2 (>0.98). The proposed method could be used as
   a practical tool to predict SFT in both geothermal and oil wells.}},

Title = {{Multidimensional NMR inversion without Kronecker products: Multilinear
   inversion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{269}},
Pages = {{24-35}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Multidimensional NMR inversion using Kronecker products poses several
   challenges. First, kernel compression is only possible when the kernel
   matrices are separable, and in recent years, there has been an
   increasing interest in NMR sequences with non-separable kernels. Second,
   in three or more dimensions, the singular value decomposition is not
   unique; therefore kernel compression is not welldefined for higher
   dimensions. Without kernel compression, the Kronecker product yields
   matrices that require large amounts of memory, making the inversion
   intractable for personal computers. Finally, incorporating arbitrary
   regularization terms is not possible using the Lawson-Hanson (LH) or the
   Butler Reeds-Dawson (BRD) algorithms. We develop a minimization-based
   inversion method that circumvents the above problems by using
   multilinear forms to perform multidimensional NMR inversion without
   using kernel compression or Kronecker products. The new method is memory
   efficient, requiring less than 0.1\% of the memory required by the LH or
   BRD methods. It can also be extended to arbitrary dimensions and adapted
   to include non-separable kernels, linear constraints, and arbitrary
   regularization terms. Additionally, it is easy to implement because only
   a cost function and its first derivative are required to perform the
   inversion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the conditions for which one-dimensional (1-D)
   nonlinear (NL) site response analysis results are distinct from
   equivalent-linear (EL) results and provides guidance for predicting when
   differences are large enough to be of practical significance. Relative
   differences in spectral accelerations and Fourier amplitudes computed
   from NL and EL analyses are assessed for a range of site conditions and
   for suites of input motions appropriate for active crustal and stable
   continental regions. Among several considered parameters, EL/NL
   differences are most clearly dependent on shear strain index (I-gamma),
   defined as the ratio of input motion peak velocity to time-averaged
   shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m of the soil profile. For small
   I-gamma (generally under 0.03\%), EL and NL results are practically
   identical, whereas at larger strains, differences can be significant for
   frequencies >0.3 Hz. Frequency-dependent I-gamma, values are recommended
   for conditions above which NL analyses are preferred to EL.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel statistical model based control algorithm, called
   Control in the Reliable Region of a Statistical model (CRROS). First,
   CRROS builds a statistical model with Gaussian process regression, which
   provides a prediction function and uncertainty of the prediction. Then,
   CRROS avoids high-uncertainty regions of the statistical model by
   regulating the null space of the pseudo inverse solution. The simulation
   results demonstrate that CRROS drives the states toward high-density and
   low-noise regions of training data, ensuring high reliability of the
   model. The experiments with a robotic finger, called Flex-finger, show
   the potential of CRROS to control robotic systems that are difficult to
   model, contain constrained inputs, and exhibit heteroscedastic noise
   output.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the life-cycle inventory impacts on energy use and
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a result of candidate travelers
   adopting carsharing in US settings. Here, households residing in
   relatively dense urban neighborhoods with good access to transit and
   traveling relatively few miles in private vehicles (roughly 10\% of the
   U.S. population) are considered candidates for carsharing. This analysis
   recognizes cradle-to-grave impacts of carsharing on vehicle ownership
   levels, travel distances, fleet fuel economy (partly due to faster
   turnover), parking demand (and associated infrastructure), and
   alternative modes. Results suggest that current carsharing members
   reduce their average individual transportation energy use and GHG
   emissions by approximately 51\% upon joining a carsharing organization.
   Collectively, these individual-level effects translate to roughly 5\%
   savings in all household transport-related energy use and GHG emissions
   in the U.S. These energy and emissions savings can be primarily
   attributed to mode shifts and avoided travel, followed by savings in
   parking infrastructure demands and fuel consumption. When indirect
   rebound effects are accounted for (assuming travel-cost savings is then
   spent on other goods and services), net savings are expected to be 3\%
   across all U.S. households. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACS CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Urea electrooxidation has attracted considerable interest as an
   alternative anodic reaction in the electrochemical generation of
   hydrogen due to both the lower electrochemical potential required to
   drive the reaction and also the possibility of eliminating a potentially
   harmful substance from wastewater during hydrogen fuel production.
   Nickel and nickel-containing oxides have shown activities comparable to
   those of precious-metal catalysts for the electrooxidation of urea in
   alkaline conditions. Herein, we investigate the use of nanostructured
   LaNiO3 perovskite supported on Vulcan carbon XC-72 as an
   electrocatalyst. This catalyst exhibits an exceptionally high mass
   activity of ca. 371 mA mg(ox)(-1) and specific activity of 2.25 A mg(-1)
   cm(ox)(-2) for the electrooxidation of urea in 1 M KOH, demonstrating
   the potential applications of Ni-based perovskites for direct urea fuel
   cells and low-energy hydrogen production. While LaNiO3 is shown to be
   stable at low overpotentials, through in-depth mechanistic studies the
   catalyst surface was observed to restructure and there was apparent CO2
   poisoning of the LaNiO3 upon extended cycling, a result that may be
   extended to other Ni-based systems.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},

Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We develop a method to measure liquid relative permeability in rocks
   directly from transient in situ saturation profiles during gravity
   drainage experiments. Previously, similar methods have been used for
   sandpacks; here, this method is extended to rocks by applying a slight
   overpressure of gas at the inlet. Relative permeabilities are obtained
   in a 60 cm long vertical Berea sandstone core during gravity drainage,
   directly from the measured unsteady-state in situ saturations along the
   core at different times. It is shown that for obtaining relative
   permeability using this method, if certain criteria are met, the
   capillary pressure of the rock can be neglected. However, it is
   essential to use a correct gas pressure gradient along the core. This
   involves incorporating the pressure drop at the outlet of the core due
   to capillary discontinuity effects. The method developed in this work
   obtains relative permeabilities in unsteady-state fashion over a wide
   range of saturations quickly and accurately. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All
