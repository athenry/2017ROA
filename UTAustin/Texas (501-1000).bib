Title = {{The influence of passive-dynamic ankle-foot orthosis bending axis
   location on gait performance in individuals with lower-limb impairments}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{13-21}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Passive-dynamic ankle-foot orthoses are commonly prescribed
   to augment impaired ankle muscle function, however their design and
   prescription are largely qualitative. One design includes a footplate
   and cuff, and flexible strut connecting the two. During gait, deflection
   occurs along the strut, with the greatest deflection at a central
   bending axis. The vertical location of the axis can affect lower
   extremity biomechanics. The goal of this study was to investigate the
   influence of bending axis location on gait performance.
   Methods: For thirteen participants with unilateral ankle muscle
   weakness, an additive manufacturing framework was used to fabricate
   passive-dynamic ankle-foot orthosis struts with central and off-center
   bending axes. Participants walked overground while electromyographic,
   kinetic and kinematic data were collected for three different bending
   axes: proximal (high), central (middle) and distal (low), and the
   participants indicated their order of bending axis preference after
   testing. Gait measures and preference effect sizes were examined during
   six regions of the gait cycle.
   Findings: A few differences between bending axes were observed: in the
   first double-leg support peak plantarflexion angle, peak dorsiflexion
   moment and positive hip work, in the early single-leg support peak knee
   extension moment and positive ankle and knee work, and in the late
   single-leg support gastrocnemius activity and vertical ground reaction
   force impulse. In addition, preference was strongly related to various
   gait measures.
   Interpretation: Despite the observed statistical differences, altering
   bending axis location did not produce large and consistent changes in
   gait performance. Thus, individual preference and comfort may be more
   important factors guiding prescription. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Pore-scale and continuum simulations of solute transport micromodel
   benchmark experiments}},

Abstract = {{Four sets of nonreactive solute transport experiments were conducted
   with micromodels. Each set consisted of three experiments with one
   variable, i.e., flow velocity, grain diameter, pore-aspect ratio, and
   flow-focusing heterogeneity. The data sets were offered to pore-scale
   modeling groups to test their numerical simulators. Each set consisted
   of two learning experiments, for which all results were made available,
   and one challenge experiment, for which only the experimental
   description and base input parameters were provided. The experimental
   results showed a nonlinear dependence of the transverse dispersion
   coefficient on the Peclet number, a negligible effect of the pore-aspect
   ratio on transverse mixing, and considerably enhanced mixing due to flow
   focusing. Five pore-scale models and one continuum-scale model were used
   to simulate the experiments. Of the pore-scale models, two used a
   pore-network (PN) method, two others are based on a lattice Boltzmann
   (LB) approach, and one used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   technique. The learning experiments were used by the PN models to modify
   the standard perfect mixing approach in pore bodies into approaches to
   simulate the observed incomplete mixing. The LB and CFD models used the
   learning experiments to appropriately discretize the spatial grid
   representations. For the continuum modeling, the required dispersivity
   input values were estimated based on published nonlinear relations
   between transverse dispersion coefficients and Peclet number.
   Comparisons between experimental and numerical results for the four
   challenge experiments show that all pore-scale models were all able to
   satisfactorily simulate the experiments. The continuum model
   underestimated the required dispersivity values, resulting in reduced
   dispersion. The PN models were able to complete the simulations in a few
   minutes, whereas the direct models, which account for the micromodel
   geometry and underlying flow and transport physics, needed up to several
   days on supercomputers to resolve the more complex problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new merit function to provide practical
   information to find optimal wind farm locations and projects based on
   spatial wind farm output prediction, including correlation with other
   wind farms. Our approach can predict what will happen when a new wind
   farm is added at various locations. Spatial power prediction of
   geographically distributed wind farms and their statistics through the
   proposed prediction model based on Kriging techniques will be presented.
   Using the proposed prediction model of wind generating resources, the
   performance of the spatial merit function in the context of the McCamey
   areas of ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) will be provided.
   A new merit function through the prediction of wind farm outputs can
   play a key role to accommodate high wind power penetration from
   spatially distributed wind farms in power system planning models. In
   addition, we also propose the Kriged Wind Farm-SMES (Superconducting
   Magnetic Energy Storage System) hybrid model to enhance the higher wind
   power penetration levels using a new merit function. The proposed merit
   function requires only the existing data of wind generating resources
   around the candidate wind farm sites in order to reduce the time and
   costs for the installation of an anemometry tower as a practical method
   of wind resource assessment study compared to MCP

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an approach for joint rate allocation and
   quality selection for a novel video streaming scheme called
   streamloading. Streamloading is a recently developed method for
   delivering high-quality video without violating copyright enforced
   restrictions on content access for video streaming. In regular streaming
   services, content providers restrict the amount of viewable video that
   users can download prior to playback. This approach can cause inferior
   user experience due to bandwidth variations, especially in mobile
   networks with varying capacity. In streamloading, the video is encoded
   using scalable video coding, and users are allowed to pre-fetch
   enhancement layers and store them on the device, while base layers are
   streamed in a near real-time fashion ensuring that buffering constraints
   on viewable content are met. We begin by formulating the offline problem
   of jointly optimizing rate allocation and quality selection for
   streamloading in a wireless network. This motivates our proposed online
   algorithms for joint scheduling at the base station and segment quality
   selection at receivers. The results indicate that streamloading
   outperforms the state-of-the-art streaming schemes in terms of the
   number of additional streams we can admit for a given video quality.
   Furthermore, the quality adaptation mechanism of our proposed algorithm
   achieves a higher performance than baseline algorithms with no (or
   limited) video-centric optimization of the base station's allocation of
   resources, e.g., proportional fairness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of information symbol availability in
   codes: we refer to a systematic code as code with (r, t)-availability if
   every information (systematic) symbol can be reconstructed from t
   disjoint groups of other code symbols, each of the sizes at most r. This
   paper shows that it is possible to construct codes that can support a
   scaling number of parallel reads while keeping the rate to be an
   arbitrarily high constant. It further shows that this is possible with
   the minimum Hamming distance arbitrarily close to the Singleton bound.
   This paper also presents a bound demonstrating a tradeoff between rate,
   minimum Hamming distance, and availability parameters. Our codes match
   the aforementioned bound, and their constructions rely on certain
   combinatorial structures. Resolvable designs provide one way to realize
   these required combinatorial structures. The two constructions presented
   in this paper require field sizes, which are linear and exponential in
   the code length, respectively. From a practical standpoint, our codes
   are relevant for distributed storage applications involving hot data,
   i.e., the information, which is frequently accessed by multiple
   processes in parallel.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a cellular network with multiantenna base stations (BSs) and
   single-antenna users, multicell cooperation, imperfect channel state
   information (CSI), and directional antennas, each with a vertically
   adjustable beam. We investigate the impact of the elevation angle of the
   BS antenna pattern, which is denoted as tilt, on the performance of the
   considered network when employing either a traditional single-cell
   transmission or a fully cooperative multicell transmission. Using the
   results of this investigation, we propose a novel hybrid multicell
   cooperation technique in which the intercell interference is controlled
   via either cooperative beamforming in the horizontal plane or
   coordinated beamforming in the vertical plane of the wireless channel,
   which is denoted as adaptive multicell 3-D beamforming. The main idea is
   to divide the coverage area into two disjoint vertical regions and adapt
   the multicell cooperation strategy at the BSs when serving each region.
   A fair scheduler is used to share the time slots between the vertical
   regions. It is shown that the proposed technique can achieve performance
   comparable with that of a fully cooperative transmission but with
   significantly lower complexity and signaling requirements. To facilitate
   computationally efficient simulation and design space exploration,
   accurate approximations of the user ergodic rate are proposed for
   different transmission strategies under imperfect CSI.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a downlink cellular network where multi-antenna base
   stations (BSs) transmit data to single-antenna users by using one of two
   linear precoding methods with limited feedback: 1) maximum ratio
   transmission (MRT) for serving a single user or 2) zero forcing (ZF) for
   serving multiple users. The BS and user locations are drawn from a
   Poisson point process, allowing expressions for the
   signal-to-interference coverage probability and the ergodic spectral
   efficiency to be derived as a function of system parameters, such as the
   number of BS antennas and feedback bits, and the pathloss exponent. We
   find a tight lower bound on the optimum number of feedback bits to
   maximize the net spectral efficiency, which captures the overall system
   gain by considering both of downlink and uplink spectral efficiency
   using limited feedback. Our main finding is that, when using MRT, the
   optimum number of feedback bits scales linearly with the number of
   antennas, and logarithmically with the channel coherence time. When
   using ZF, the feedback scales in the same ways as MRT, but also linearly
   with the pathloss exponent. The derived results provide system-level
   insights into the preferred channel codebook size by averaging the
   effects of short-term fading and long-term pathloss.}},

Abstract = {{A fully polarizable implementation of the hybrid quantum
   mechanics/molecular mechanics approach is presented, where the classical
   environment is described through the AMOEBA polarizable force field. A
   variational formalism, offering a self-consistent relaxation of both the
   MM induced dipoles and the QM electronic density, is used for ground
   state energies and extended to electronic excitations in the framework
   of time dependent density functional theory combined with a state
   specific response of the classical part. An application to the
   calculation of the solvatochromism of the pyridinium N-phenolate betaine
   dye used to define the solvent E-T(30) scale is presented. The results
   show that the QM/AMOEBA model not only properly describes specific and
   bulk effects in the ground state but it also correctly responds to the
   large change in the solute electronic charge distribution upon

Abstract = {{The problem of stabilizing rigid-body attitude dynamics in the presence
   of pointwise time delay for the input torque is considered. A
   quaternion-based linear state feedback controller is shown to achieve
   local stability subject to a sufficient condition that depends only on
   the magnitude of the initial angular rates. More specifically, no
   restrictions are imposed on the body initial orientation, which is a
   significant contrast with other results from the literature that adopt
   three-dimensional representations for the attitude kinematics. Using the
   quaternion-based linear feedback structure, the closed-loop system is
   shown to never admit the possibility of finite-time escapes. Although
   the actual magnitude of the time delay can be unknown, an upper bound on
   the delay is assumed to be known. The proof relies on the construction
   of a new functional that does not belong to the family of the strict
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals but shares important features with the
   functionals of this family. The stability conditions and results are
   illustrated through numerical simulations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{234}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a homogenization model for the macroscopic
   rheological behavior of non colloidal suspensions of initially
   spherical, viscoelastic particles in yield stress fluids, which are
   subjected to uniform flow conditions. The constitutive behavior of the
   suspending fluid is characterized by the Herschel-Bulkley (HB) model,
   and the particles are assumed to be neutrally buoyant solids
   characterized by the finite-strain Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model. We
   make use of the ``linear comparison composite{''} variational technique
   of Ponte Castaneda (1991) to approximate the instantaneous response of
   the suspensions of viscoelastic particles in the HB fluid by that of a
   fictitious suspension consisting of the same particles distributed
   identically in a Newtonian fluid with a suitably-chosen viscosity. The
   response of the latter suspension is then estimated by the
   homogenization model recently developed by Avazmohammadi and Ponte
   Castaneda (2015), which, when combined with appropriate evolution laws
   for the relevant microstructural variables, provides a complete
   characterization of the time-dependent response of the actual
   suspensions. With the objective of illustrating the key features of our
   model, we consider the particular case of suspensions of elastic
   particles in HB fluids under shear flow conditions. The results provide
   a broad picture of the influence of the HB fluid and particle
   constitutive properties, as well as of the particle volume fraction on
   the effective time-dependent and steady-state behaviors of the
   suspensions. For the special case of non-deformable particles, our model
   predicts that the suspensions behave like HB fluids with modified
   properties, consistent with the results of Chateau et al. (2008). (C)

Abstract = {{The theoretical development of a magnetic force and an induced motion
   while applying a magnetic field to magnetic nanoparticles in elastic
   media is described. An analytical expression for tissue-surface
   displacement derived from Mindlin's theory of elasticity in

   The initial motion of the magnetic nanoparticles is driven by a constant
   magnetic force that displays a dampened transient motion before
   steady-state movement at twice the modulation frequency of the applied
   sinusoidal magnetic field. The motion of the nanoparticles at double the
   modulation frequency originated from the magnetic force being
   proportional to the product of the magnetic flux density and its
   gradient. Finally, we demonstrate the detection of iron-oxide
   nanoparticles taken up by liver parenchymal Kupffer cells and

Abstract = {{In this experimental study a new flow regime map for gas-liquid

   transient flow pressure signals and utilizing neural networks. In this
   regard, the pressure signals of an air-water two phase flow at different
   location on a vertical pipe with an inside diameter of 50 mm and a total
   length of 6 m are measured. Averaged pressure and pressure fluctuation
   data were analyzed in different flow regimes along the upriser pipe to
   recognize the effects of flow regimes on pressure response. A set of
   pressure parameters are introduced based on averaged pressure data to
   present meaningful criteria for flow regime identification. Pressure
   fluctuations also used for flow regime recognition by applying two
   common signal processing methods. The processed signals are used as the
   inputs of a feed forward back propagation neural network to predict the
   flow regime. The neural network outputs are then used to present a flow
   regime map. The proposed neural network flow map is compared with the
   experimental data by photographic flow visualization technique. This

Abstract = {{Mammalian cell line development requires streamlined methodologies that
   will reduce both the cost and time to identify candidate cell lines.
   Improvements in site-specific genomic editing techniques can result in
   flexible, predictable, and robust cell line engineering. However, an
   outstanding question in the field is the specific site of integration.
   Here, we seek to identify productive loci within the human genome that
   will result in stable, high expression of heterologous DNA. Using an
   unbiased, random integration approach and a green fluorescent reporter
   construct, we identify ten single-integrant, recombinant human cell
   lines that exhibit stable, high-level expression. From these cell lines,
   eight unique corresponding integration loci were identified. These loci
   are concentrated in non-protein coding regions or intronic regions of
   protein coding genes. Expression mapping of the surrounding genes
   reveals minimal disruption of endogenous gene expression. Finally, we
   demonstrate that targeted de novo integration at one of the identified
   loci, the 12(th) exon-intron region of the GRIK1 gene on chromosome 21,
   results in superior expression and stability compared to the standard,
   illegitimate integration approach at levels approaching 4-fold. The
   information identified here along with recent advances in site-specific
   genomic editing techniques can lead to expedited cell line development.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid increases in global energy use and growing environmental concerns
   have prompted the development of clean and sustainable alternative
   energy technologies. Electrical energy storage (EES) is critical for
   efficiently utilizing electricity produced from intermittent, renewable
   sources such as solar and wind, as well as for electrifying the
   transportation sector. Rechargeable batteries are prime candidates for
   EES, but widespread adoption requires optimization of cost, cycle life,
   safety, energy density, power density, and environmental impact, all of
   which are directly linked to severe materials challenges. This article
   presents a brief overview of the electrode materials currently used in
   lithium-ion batteries, followed by the challenges and prospects of
   next-generation insertion-reaction electrodes and conversion-reaction
   electrodes with a Li+ working ion. Finally, we discuss future directions
   involving solid electrolytes, multi-electron transfer hosts, and other
   working ions.}},

   Dysphagia}},
Journal = {{PM\&R}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: For patients with dysphagia due to stroke, in addition to
   compensatory strategies, exercises are used to help improve motor
   function. Biofeedback is used in neuromuscular training and is promising
   for swallowing training.
   Objective: To evaluate the functional value of game-based biofeedback in
   swallowing therapy for patients with poststroke dysphagia.
   Design: A case-control study.
   Setting: Academic tertiary hospital.
   Participants: Subjects with poststroke dysphagia (n = 20) were
   individually matched to 2 separate groups, a game-based biofeedback
   group (n = 10) or a control group (n = 10), for age, gender, duration of
   dysphagia, and dysphagia grades.
   Interventions: Each participant underwent 1-hour sessions 3 times per
   week for a total of 16 treatment sessions. Each session included a
   30-minute session of traditional swallow treatment and a 30-minute
   session of laryngeal elevation exercises. In the experimental group,
   laryngeal elevation exercises were combined with additional game-based
   biofeedback.
   Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes assessed before and after interventions
   included hyoid bone displacement, Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS)
   scores, and nasogastric (NG) tube removal rate.
   Results: Intergroup analyses showed larger differences in hyoid bone
   displacement and FOIS scores (before and after treatment) in the
   experimental group than in the control group, with statistical
   significance (P = .007 and P = .014, respectively). Intergroup analyses
   showed that the hyoid bone displacement change and FOIS scores before
   and after treatment exhibited statistically significant improvement only
   in the experimental group (P = .002 and P = .004, respectively). In all,
   8 of 10 patients (80\%) in the experimental group and 2 of 10 patients
   (20\%) in the control group discontinued NG tube insertion after
   therapy. Participation in the experimental group was associated with an
   increased probability of tube removal (odds ratio = 6.00; 95\%
   confidence interval = 1.08-33.27, P = .009).
   Conclusions: Laryngeal elevation training combined with game-based
   biofeedback augments the change in hyoid bone displacement and FOIS
   scores, and increases the NG tube removal rate in patients with
   poststroke dysphagia.}},

Abstract = {{Coherent thermal phonons (CTPs) play an important role in thermal
   transport in superlattice (SL) structures. To have a profound
   understanding of CTP transport in SL, direct measurement of CTP
   properties is necessary. In this study, coherent phonon spectroscopy has
   been utilized to generate and detect CTP in Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 SL. Phonon
   lifetimes have been extracted from experimental data, with which
   mode-wise thermal conductivities have been calculated. Comparing with
   bulk Bi2Te3, the estimated mode-wise thermal conductivity of
   longitudinal acoustic phonons shifts to higher frequencies, due to
   constructive coherent phonon interference. Our results suggest that it
   is possible to use SL structure to manipulate coherent phonon
   propagation and to tailor thermal conductivity.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We define an adaptive routing problem in a stochastic time-dependent
   transit network in which transit arc travel times are discrete random
   variables with known probability distributions. We formulate it as a
   finite horizon Markov decision process. Routing strategies are
   conditioned on the arrival time of the traveler at intermediate nodes
   and real-time information on arrival times of buses at stops along their
   routes. The objective is to find a strategy that minimizes the expected
   travel time, subject to a constraint that guarantees that the
   destination is reached within a certain threshold. Although this
   framework proves to be advantageous over a priori routing, it inherits
   the curse of dimensionality, and state space reduction through
   preprocessing is achieved by solving variants of the time-dependent
   shortest path problem. Numerical results on a network representing a
   part of the Austin, Texas, transit system indicate a promising reduction
   in the state space size and improved tractability of the dynamic
   program.}},

Abstract = {{BF+ implantation is used for the first time for the formation of

Abstract = {{Interaction between Polyox N12K and Carbopol 907 was pH dependent. A
   hydrogen bond-induced complexation began between pH 5.0 and 6.0 in an
   aqueous medium, and the interpolymer complex started to precipitate when
   the pH fell to 4.0. This complex was amorphous with a glass transition
   temperature of 3.17 degrees C. The molar ratio between ethylene oxide
   and acrylic acid units in the complex was 1.3:1. About 46\% of the COOH
   groups in Carbopol 907 were H bonded to ether oxygen in Polyox.
   Theophylline release from tablets containing both polymers was a
   function of dissolution media pH, due to the pH-dependent interactions.
   In 0.01 N HCl, an insoluble tablet matrix formed in situ. 93\% drug was
   released over 27 h via Fickian diffusion. In acetate buffer pH 4.0, the
   insoluble tablet matrix formed in situ disintegrated into tiny gel
   particles. Gel erosion controlled drug release at pH 4.0. These 2
   polymers were unable to complex in a phosphate buffer pH 6.8. Therefore,
   the tablet matrix dissolved, and drug release followed the anomalous
   transport mechanism at pH 6.8. The release profiles in an acetate buffer
   pH 4.0 and phosphate buffer pH 6.8 were statistically same, and a
   sustained release over 12 h was achieved. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists

Abstract = {{Interlayer tunnel field-effect transistors based on graphene and
   hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently attracted much interest for
   their potential as beyond-CMOS devices. Using a recently developed
   method for fabricating rotationally aligned two-dimensional
   heterostructures, we show experimental results for devices with varying
   thicknesses and stacking order of the graphene electrode layers and also
   model the current voltage behavior. We show that an increase in the
   graphene layer thickness results in narrower resonance. However, due to
   a simultaneous increase in the number of sub-bands and decrease of
   sub-band separation with an increase in thickness, the negative
   differential resistance peaks becomes less prominent and do not appear
   for certain conditions at room temperature. Also, we show that due to
   the unique band structure of odd number of layer Bernal-stacked
   graphene, the number of closely spaced resonance conditions increase,
   causing interference between neighboring resonance peaks. Although this
   can be avoided with even number of layer graphene, we find that in this
   case the bandgap opening present at high biases tend to broaden the
   resonance peaks.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses discourse analysis to explore online science
   communication experiences from the perspectives of 43 female opinion
   leaders. Women described their experiences in terms of their lifelong
   love for science and their ever-growing interest in communication. For
   them, a career in science communication is a conscious career choice
   rather than an alternative career path. Communicators performed various
   functions depending on the sensitivity of their topics and whether their
   communications are self-focused or audience-focused. Accordingly, four
   types of science communicators emerged from the data:
   Expressive/Escapist, Advocate/Normalizer, Edutainer, and
   Performer/Sharer. This diversity challenges societal stereotypes that
   reduce female experiences in science.}},

Abstract = {{Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods are made easily
   implementable using ``broken{''} test spaces, i.e., spaces of functions
   with no continuity constraints across mesh element interfaces. Broken
   spaces derivable from a standard exact sequence of first order
   (unbroken) Sobolev spaces are of particular interest. A characterization
   of interface spaces that connect the broken spaces to their unbroken
   counterparts is provided. Stability of certain formulations using the
   broken spaces can be derived from the stability of analogues that use
   unbroken spaces. This technique is used to provide a complete error
   analysis of DPG methods for Maxwell equations with perfect electric
   boundary conditions. The technique also permits considerable
   simplifications of previous analyses of DPG methods for other equations.
   Reliability and efficiency estimates for an error indicator also follow.
   Finally, the equivalence of stability for various formulations of the
   same Maxwell problem is proved, including the strong form, the ultraweak
   form, and various forms in between. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Semiconductor electrodes capable of using solar photons to drive
   water-splitting reactions, such as haematite (alpha-Fe2O3), have been
   the subject of tremendous interest over recent decades. The surface has
   been found to play a significant role in determining the efficiency of
   water oxidation with haematite; however, previous works have only
   allowed hypotheses to be formulated regarding the identity of relevant
   surface species. Here we investigate the water-oxidation reaction on
   haematite using infrared spectroscopy under photoelectrochemical (PEC)
   water-oxidation conditions. A potential-and light-dependent absorption
   peak at 898 cm(-1) is assigned to a Fe-IV=O group, which is an
   intermediate in the PEC water-oxidation reaction. These results provide
   direct evidence of high-valent iron-oxo intermediates as the product of
   the first hole-transfer reaction on the haematite surface and represent
   an important step in establishing the mechanism of PEC water oxidation
   on semiconductor electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the biomechanical behavior of heart valve leaflet tissues in
   a noninvasive manner remains an important clinical goal. While advances
   in 3D imaging modalities have made in vivo valve geometric data
   available, optimal methods to exploit such information in order to
   obtain functional information remain to be established. Herein we
   present and evaluate a novel leaflet shape-based framework to estimate
   the biomechanical behavior of heart valves from surface deformations by
   exploiting tissue structure. We determined accuracy levels using an
   ``ideal{''} in vitro dataset, in which the leaflet geometry, strains,
   mechanical behavior, and fibrous structure were known to a high level of
   precision. By utilizing a simplified structural model for the leaflet
   mechanical behavior, we were able to limit the number of parameters to
   be determined per leaflet to only two. This approach allowed us to
   dramatically reduce the computational time and easily visualize the cost
   function to guide the minimization process. We determined that the image
   resolution and the number of available imaging frames were important
   components in the accuracy of our framework. Furthermore, our results
   suggest that it is possible to detect differences in fiber structure
   using our framework, thus allowing an opportunity to diagnose
   asymptomatic valve diseases and begin treatment at their early stages.
   Lastly, we observed good agreement of the final resulting stress-strain
   response when an averaged fiber architecture was used. This suggests
   that population-averaged fiber structural data may be sufficient for the
   application of the present framework to in vivo studies, although
   clearly much work remains to extend the present approach to in vivo
   problems.}},

Journal = {{BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Studies have shown that random vibration theory (RVT) site-response
   analysis predicts site amplification at the natural site frequencies
   that are systematically larger than the results obtained from time
   series (TS) analysis using a suite of input TS. A critical part of the
   RVT approach is the peak factor, defined as the ratio of the peak to
   root mean square (rms) value of a signal. This study investigates the
   influence of different peak factor models on the site amplification
   estimated by RVT site-response analysis. It is shown that the use of the
   Vanmarcke (1975) peak factor model rather than the Cartwright and
   Longuet-Higgins (1956) peak factor model predicts site amplification in
   better agreement with those predicted by TS analysis, although some
   differences remain for some cases. Larger differences between the RVT
   and TS results occur for sites with smaller natural frequencies, for
   earthquakes of smaller magnitude, and for sites with larger bedrock
   shear-wave velocities. Accounting for the increase in duration due to
   site response in the RVT analysis minimizes the differences between RVT
   and TS analysis. Recommendations are provided regarding the cases where
   RVT provides site amplification reasonably similar to TS analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This article defines, formulates, and solves a new equilibrium traffic
   assignment problem with side constraintsthe traffic assignment problem
   with relays. The relay requirement arises from the driving situation
   that the onboard fuel capacity of vehicles is lower than what is needed
   for accomplishing their trips and the number and distribution of
   refueling infrastructures over the network are under the expected level.
   We proposed this problem as a modeling platform for evaluating congested
   regional transportation networks that serve plug-in electric vehicles
   (in addition to internal combustion engine vehicles), where
   battery-recharging or battery-swapping stations are scarce.
   Specifically, we presented a novel nonlinear integer programming
   formulation, analyzed its mathematical properties and paradoxical
   phenomena, and suggested a generalized Benders decomposition framework
   for its solutions. In the algorithmic framework, a gradient projection
   algorithm and a labeling algorithm are adopted for, respectively,
   solving the primal problem and the relaxed master problemthe shortest
   path problem with relays. The modeling and solution methods are
   implemented for solving a set of example network problems. The numerical
   analysis results obtained from the implementation clearly show how the
   driving range limit and relay station location reshape equilibrium
   network flows.}},

Title = {{Paradoxes of reservation-based intersection controls in traffic networks}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{14-25}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Reservation-based intersection control is a revolutionary idea for using
   connected autonomous vehicle technologies to improve intersection
   controls. Vehicles individually request permission to follow precise
   paths through the intersection at specific times from an intersection
   manager agent. Previous studies have shown that reservations can reduce
   delays beyond optimized signals in many demand scenarios. The purpose of
   this paper is to demonstrate that signals can outperform reservations
   through theoretical and realistic examples. We present two examples that
   exploit the reservation protocol to prioritize vehicles on local roads
   over vehicles on arterials, increasing the total vehicle delay. A third
   theoretical example demonstrates that reservations can encourage selfish
   route choice leading to arbitrarily large queues. Next, we present two
   realistic networks taken from metropolitan planning organization data in
   which reservations perform worse than signals. We conclude with
   significantly positive results from comparing reservations and signals
   on the downtown Austin grid network using dynamic traffic assignment.
   Overall, these results indicate that network-based analyses are needed
   to detect adverse route choices before traffic signals can be replaced
   with reservation controls. In asymmetric intersections (e.g. local
   road-arterial intersections), reservation controls can cause several
   potential issues. However, in networks with more symmetric intersections
   such as a downtown grid, reservations have great potential to improve
   traffic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pressure-Poisson Boussinesq models of Donahue et al. (2014) are
   extended to the surf zone and tested at O(mu(2)) and O(mu(4)). This
   approach resembles a classic Boussinesq-type model with the exception
   that the dispersive accuracy is obtained through consideration of a
   Boussinesq-scaled Green-Naghdi type approximation to the nonhydrostatic
   pressure profile and solved as a solution to the pressure-Poisson
   equation. The result is a Boussinesq-type model that is similar to the
   shallow water equations (SWE) with a nonhydrostatic pressure term. This
   allows for the straightforward modification of established SWE solvers
   to turn them into fully resolved nearshore models with very little
   structural change to the underlying SWE model and without the need to
   solve mixed space/time derivatives. The excellent hyperbolic properties
   of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method are used to
   solve all terms except pressure and a simple yet accurate finite
   difference approach is used to solve the elliptic pressure equations. A
   straightforward numerics based wave breaking algorithm is employed and
   wave runup is captured using a globally mass conservative wetting/drying
   algorithm specifically designed for DG finite element methods. The
   result is a full surf-zone model capable of capturing the propagation of
   waves offshore, the breaking of waves near shore and full wave runup.
   The model is verified and validated using analytical and experimental
   results for both fully nonlinear O(mu(2)) and weakly nonlinear
   O(mu(4))implementations. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional P- and S-wave velocity profiling of geotechnical sites
   using full-waveform inversion driven by field data}},
Journal = {{SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{63-81}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We discuss the application of a recently developed
   full-waveform-inversion-based technique to the imaging of geotechnical
   sites using field-collected data. Specifically, we address the profiling
   of arbitrarily heterogeneous sites in terms of P- and S-wave velocities
   in three dimensions, using elastic waves as probing agents. We cast the
   problem of finding the spacial distribution of the elastic soil
   properties as an inverse medium problem, directly in the time domain,
   and use perfectly-matched-layers (PMLs) to account for the semi-infinite
   extent of the site under investigation.
   After briefly reviewing the theoretical and computational aspects of the
   employed technique, we focus on the characterization of the George E.
   Brown Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation site in Garner
   Valley, California (NEES@UCSB). We compare the profiles obtained from
   our full-waveform-inversion-based methodology against the profiling
   obtained from the Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface Waves (SASW) method, and
   report agreement. In an attempt to validate our methodology, we also
   compare the recorded field data at select control sensors that were not
   used for the full-waveform inversion, against the response at the same
   sensors, computed based on the full-waveform-inverted profiles. We
   report very good agreement at the control sensors, which is a strong
   indicator of the correctness of the inverted profiles. Overall, the
   systematic framework discussed herein seems robust, general, practical,
   and promising for three-dimensional site characterization purposes. (C)

Title = {{Co-transport of gold nanospheres with single-walled carbon nanotubes in
   saturated porous media}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{7-15}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Porous media transport of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is typically
   assessed in a controlled single particulate environment. Presence of a
   secondary particle (either natural or engineered) in the natural
   environment though likely, is rarely taken into consideration in
   assessing ENMs' transport behavior. This study systematically assesses
   the effect of a secondary ENM (i.e., pluronic acid modified
   single-walled carbon nanotubes, PA-SWNTs) on a primary particle (i.e.,
   gold nanospheres, AuNSs) transport through saturated porous media under
   a wide range of aquatic conditions (1-100 mM NaCl). AuNS
   hetero-dispersions (i.e., with PA-SWNTs) are transported through
   saturated sand columns, and the transport behavior is compared to
   AuNS-only homo-dispersion cases, which display classical ionic strength
   dependent behavior. AuNS hetero-dispersion, however, is highly mobile
   with little to no ionic strength-dependent effects. This study also
   assesses the role of pre-coating of the collectors with PA-SWNTs on
   AuNSs' mobility, thereby elucidating the role played by the order of
   introduction of the secondary particles. Pre-existence of the secondary
   particles in the porous media shows enhanced filtration of primary
   AuNSs. However, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) slightly
   increases AuNS mobility through PA-SWNT coated sand at 10 mM ionic
   strength. The study results demonstrate that the presence and order of
   addition of the secondary particles strongly influence primary
   particles' mobility. Thus ENMs can demonstrate facilitated transport or
   enhanced removal, depending on the presence of the secondary particulate
   matter and background solution chemistry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{502}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{104-125}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new method to compute general cubature formulae. The
   problem is initially transformed into the computation of truncated
   Hankel operators with flat extensions. We then analyze the algebraic
   properties associated to flat extensions and show how to recover the
   cubature points and weights from the truncated Hankel operator. We next
   present an algorithm to test the flat extension property and to
   additionally compute the decomposition. To generate cubature formulae
   with a minimal number of points, we propose a new relaxation hierarchy
   of convex optimization problems minimizing the nuclear norm of the
   Hankel operators. For a suitably high order of convex relaxation, the
   minimizer of the optimization problem corresponds to a cubature formula.
   Furthermore cubature formulae with a minimal number of points are
   associated to faces of the convex sets. We illustrate our method on some
   examples, and for each we obtain a new minimal cubature formula. (C)

   energetically stable clusters agree well with experiment, wherein the

Abstract = {{The functionalization of polyfluorene (PFO) nanoparticles by
   coprecipitation of the conjugated polymer with an amphiphilic comb
   polymer, consisting of a hydrophobic polystyrene backbone with
   hydrophilic, carboxylic acid-terminated polyethylene oxide side-chains
   (PS-PEG-COOH), is investigated. The comb polymer affects the properties
   of the formed hybrid nanoparticles. Non-functionalized particles are
   typically larger (28 nm) than functionalized ones (20 nm); peak molar
   extinction coefficients are found to differ in a similar trend. Zeta
   potentials are negative, consistent with negative surface charge on PFO
   particles due to chemical defect formation, with additional charge on
   functionalized particles due to the pendant carboxylic acid groups.
   Emission quantum yields of functionalized particles are typically
   larger, consistent with lower efficiency of energy transfer to quenchers
   in smaller particles and weaker PFO interchain interactions due to chain
   dilution. The trend in per-particle fluorescence brightness values, as
   confirmed by single particle fluorescence imaging, reflects the
   nanoparticle extinction coefficients. Photostability studies on aqueous
   dispersions of hybrid particles indicate mild photobrightening under
   continuous illumination while PFO particles exhibit slow exponential
   emission decay. Functionalized particles are also resistant to
   aggregation during exposure to adenocarcinoma cells. Generally, the
   hybrid particles exhibit more favorable time-, pH-and medium-dependent
   stabilities, likely due to steric and electrostatic stabilization by
   PEGcarboxylic acid functionalities. Overall, the functionalized
   particles exhibit attractive properties: Reasonably small size, tight
   size distribution, high absorption cross section, radiative rate and
   emission quantum yield, excellent brightness and photostability, and
   good colloidal stability.}},

Abstract = {{In the atmosphere nighttime removal of volatile organic compounds is
   initiated to a large extent by reaction with the nitrate radical (NO3)
   forming organic nitrates which partition between gas and particulate
   phase. Here we show based on particle phase measurements performed at a
   suburban site in the Netherlands that organic nitrates contribute
   substantially to particulate nitrate and organic mass. Comparisons with
   a chemistry transport model indicate that most of the measured
   particulate organic nitrates are formed by NO3 oxidation. Using aerosol
   composition data from three intensive observation periods at numerous
   measurement sites across Europe, we conclude that organic nitrates are a
   considerable fraction of fine particulate matter (PM1) at the
   continental scale. Organic nitrates represent 34\% to 44\% of measured
   submicron aerosol nitrate and are found at all urban and rural sites,
   implying a substantial potential of PM reduction by NOx emission
   control.}},

Title = {{Calculations of oxide formation on low-index Cu surfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Density-functional theory is used to evaluate the mechanism of copper
   surface oxidation. Reaction pathways of O-2 dissociation on the surface
   and oxidation of the sub-surface are found on the Cu(100), Cu(110), and
   Cu(111) facets. At low oxygen coverage, all three surfaces dissociate
   O-2 spontaneously. As oxygen accumulates on the surfaces, O-2
   dissociation becomes more difficult. A bottleneck to further oxidation
   occurs when the surfaces are saturated with oxygen. The barriers for O-2
   dissociation on the O-saturated Cu(100)-c(2x2)-0.5 monolayer (ML) and
   Cu(100) missing-row structures are 0.97 eV and 0.75 eV, respectively;
   significantly lower than those have been reported previously. Oxidation
   of Cu(110)-c(6x2), the most stable (110) surface oxide, has a barrier of
   0.72 eV. As the reconstructions grow from step edges, clean Cu(110)
   surfaces can dissociatively adsorb oxygen until the surface Cu atoms are
   saturated. After slight rearrangements, these surface areas form a ``1
   ML{''} oxide structure which has not been reported in the literature.
   The barrier for further oxidation of this ``1 ML{''} phase is only 0.31
   eV. Finally the oxidized Cu(111) surface has a relatively low reaction
   energy barrier for O-2 dissociation, even at high oxygen coverage, and
   allows for facile oxidation of the subsurface by fast O diffusion
   through the surface oxide. The kinetic mechanisms found provide a
   qualitative explanation of the observed oxidation of the low-index Cu
   surfaces. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{SMALL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{3837-3848}},

Abstract = {{Liposomes and nanoparticles that bind selectively to cell-surface
   receptors can target specific populations of cells. However, chemical
   conjugation of ligands to these particles is difficult to control,
   frequently limiting ligand uniformity and complexity. In contrast, the
   surfaces of living cells are decorated with highly uniform populations
   of sophisticated transmembrane proteins. Toward harnessing cellular
   capabilities, here it is demonstrated that plasma membrane vesicles
   (PMVs) derived from donor cells can display engineered transmembrane
   protein ligands that precisely target cells on the basis of receptor
   expression. These multifunctional targeting proteins incorporate (i) a
   protein ligand, (ii) an intrinsically disordered protein spacer to make
   the ligand sterically accessible, and (iii) a fluorescent protein domain
   that enables quantification of the ligand density on the PMV surface.
   PMVs that display targeting proteins with affinity for the epidermal
   growth factor receptor (EGFR) bind at increasing concentrations to
   breast cancer cells that express increasing levels of EGFR. Further, as
   an example of the generality of this approach, PMVs expressing a
   single-domain antibody against green fluorescence protein (eGFP) bind to
   cells expressing eGFP-tagged receptors with a selectivity of approximate
   to 50:1. The results demonstrate the versatility of PMVs as cell
   targeting systems, suggesting diverse applications from drug delivery to
   tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{This work targets the area selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) of
   TiN onto HfO2 for use as the word line in a memory device. Unlike other
   patterning processes, AS-ALD eliminates etching steps and also allows
   for growth of patterned films with precise thickness control. This study
   investigates how AS-ALD differs on planar and nonplanar surfaces. Using
   a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate a way
   to confer selectivity to a substrate using surface features.
   Self-assembled monolayers form defects at regions of high curvature,
   allowing nucleation of TiN films in ALD. This is in contrast to a
   treated planar surface with no features, which exhibits complete
   blocking of TiN up to a certain limit of ALD cycles.}},

Abstract = {{In recent works, we demonstrated that donor-b-acceptor block copolymer
   compatibilizers can be utilized in donor acceptor blends of conjugated
   homopolymer donors and PCBM acceptors to target equilibrium morphologies
   containing the interconnected, cocontinuous structures that are desired
   for efficient bulk heterojunction devices. In this article, we utilize a
   combination of morphology and device-level simulations to demonstrate
   that by tuning the photo electronic properties of the block copolymer
   additives, the device characteristics of such ternary blend systems can
   be made to outperform the idealized morphologies envisioned in donor
   acceptor systems. Explicitly, we propose that by appropriately choosing
   the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the block copolymer additives, an
   energy cascade can be exploited to reduce charge recombination and
   increase fill factors. The resulting device performance of such ternary
   blends reflects the combined influence of morphology and energy
   cascades, and in some instances, ternary blend morphologies can
   outperform even the idealized columnar morphologies proposed for bulk
   heterojunction devices. Together, our results suggest that the use of
   block copolymer additives in ternary blend systems may represent a
   unique strategy to exploit the combined influence of photoelectronic
   properties and morphology on the device characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of graphene oxide (GO) are of great importance
   for applications in materials engineering. Previous mechanochemical
   studies of GO typically focused on the influence of the degree of
   oxidation on the mechanical behavior. In this study, using density
   functional-based tight binding simulations, validated using density
   functional theory simulations, we reveal that the deformation and
   failure of GO are strongly dependent on the relative concentrations of
   epoxide (-O-) and hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups. Hydroxyl groups
   cause GO to behave as a brittle material; by contrast, epoxide groups
   enhance material ductility through a mechanically driven
   epoxide-to-ether functional group transformation. Moreover, with
   increasing epoxide group concentration, the strain to failure and
   toughness of GO significantly increases without sacrificing material
   strength and stiffness. These findings demonstrate that GO should be
   treated as a versatile, tunable material that may be engineered by
   controlling chemical composition, rather than as a single, archetypical
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Invisibility cloaks have been one of the major breakthroughs in the
   field of metamaterials, and several techniques are currently available
   to suppress the electromagnetic scattering from different objects. So
   far, however, theoretical and experimental results have consistently
   shown fundamental challenges in terms of the bandwidth and size of the
   object to be hidden. Understanding the bandwidth limitations of cloaking
   therefore becomes important to assess the applicability and potential of
   cloaking devices in practical scenarios. While it is generally accepted
   that cloaking is difficult to achieve, no work to date has quantified
   this issue for general invisibility devices. Here, by applying the
   Bode-Fano theory of broadband matching, we derive fundamental bounds on
   bandwidth and performance for general passive cloaking schemes applied
   to planar objects, determined by the properties of the object to be
   hidden, and then explore their implications in three-dimensional
   scenarios. Our results define a general framework to estimate the
   ultimate performance of passive cloaks and suggest that fundamentally
   new directions, involving nonlinearities and active metamaterials,
   become necessary to realize broadband cloaking, opening a new phase in
   the quest for invisibility. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Subwavelength grating waveguide-based micro-ring resonators (SWGMRs) are
   a promising platform for research in light-matter interaction. However,
   it is extremely difficult to achieve small radius SWGMR devices (e.g., 5
   mu m) with satisfying quality factors (e.g., similar to 10,000). One
   major issue is the large bend loss of small radius SWGMRs. In this work,
   we report the use of trapezoidal silicon pillars instead of conventional
   rectangular silicon pillars as building blocks of SWGMRs. We found that
   an asymmetric effective refractive index profile created by trapezoidal
   silicon pillars can significantly reduce the bend loss and therefore
   increase the quality factors of SWGMRs. For the first time to the best
   of our knowledge, we have experimentally demonstrated a 5 mu m radius
   SWGMR made of trapezoidal silicon pillars (T-SWGMR) with an applicable
   quality factor as high as 11,500, 4.6 times of that (similar to 2800)
   offered by a conventional SWGMR made of rectangular silicon pillars,
   which indicates an 81.4\% reduction of the propagation loss. This
   approach can also be readily employed to enhance SWGMRs with larger
   radii. We have also experimentally demonstrated a 10 mu m radius T-SWGMR
   with a quality factor as high as 45,000, which indicates a propagation
   loss as low as 6.07 dB/cm. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Pyrolysis of beech wood (Fagus sylvatica) was investigated based on
   thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared
   spectrometry analysis at heating rates from 20 Kimin to 60 K/min. The
   various activation energies were estimated at different conversions by
   three model-free methods and were in the range of 146.84-174.44 kJ/rnol.
   The peak locations of three main components (hemicellulose, cellulose
   and lignin) were predicted more exactly by the K-K method. The
   absorbance spectra corresponding to the three peak locations were
   basically the same at different heating rates, indicating that the
   heating rate had little influence on the produced composition. During
   the whole pyrolysis process, the evolution of gas components (CO, CO2,
   methane, methanol and formaldehyde) was consistent with the trend of
   derivative thermogravimetric curves, and possible formation pathways of
   main gases were tentatively presented. The amount of these five
   components produced in the order of most to least produced was
   formaldehyde > CO2 or methanol > methane > CO. In particular, the amount
   of formaldehyde was almost triple the amount of methanol and ten times
   the amount of methane at the maximum peak. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We report molecular-fluorescence enhancement via the blue-shifted
   plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) from single Au
   nanorods (AuNRs) to merocyanine (MC) dye molecules. The blue-shifted
   PIRET occurs when there is a proper spectral overlap between the
   scattering of AuNRs and the absorption of MC molecules. Along with the
   quenching of scattering from AuNRs, the blue-shifted PIRET enhances the
   fluorescence of nearby molecules. On the basis of the fluorescence
   enhancement, we conclude that AuNRs can be used as donors with clear
   advantages to excite the fluorescence of molecules as acceptors in AuNR
   molecule hybrids. On the one hand, compared to conventional molecular
   donors in Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), AuNRs have much
   larger absorption cross sections at the plasmon resonance frequencies.
   On the other hand, energy-transfer efficiency of PIRET decreases at a
   lower rate than that of FRET when the donor acceptor distance is
   increased. Besides, the blue-shifted PIRET allows excitation with
   incident light of lower energy than the acceptor's absorption, which is
   difficult to achieve in FRET because of the Stokes shift. With the
   capability of enhancing molecular fluorescence with excitation light of
   low intensity and long wavelength, the blue-shifted PIRET will expand
   the applications of nanoparticle molecule hybrids in biosensing and
   bioimaging by increasing signal-to-noise ratio and by reducing
   photodamage to biological cells and organelles at the targeted areas.}},

Abstract = {{Block copolymer (BCP) blends offer a facile route toward customizable
   nanomaterials. To better understand these systems, the thermodynamics of
   polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) and
   poly(vinylphenol) (PVPH) blends were examined using scattering
   measurements and self-consistent field theory (SCFT). PVPH hydrogen
   bonds to the PMMA block, resulting in the selective infusion into the
   PMMA layer. Measurements on initially disordered blends show that this
   interaction can induce an order disorder transition (ODT). The ODT was
   observed to be a continuous transition, unlike the first-order thermal
   ODT typically observed in BCPs. Free energy curves extracted from SCFT
   simulations also observed a lack of a discontinuity in the first-order
   derivative. Lamellar systems underwent a greater increase in BCP period
   compared to identical athermal systems due to the extension of the PMMA
   chains away from the interface. Comparison with the SCFT models finds
   good agreement in the predicted behavior of the blends using a negative
   chi parameter to model interactions between PVPH and PMMA, including the
   predicted distribution of the PVPH throughout the PMMA layer.}},

Abstract = {{Versatile and spatiotemporally controlled methods for decorating
   surfaces with monolayers of attached polymers are broadly impactful to
   many technological applications. However, current materials are usually
   designed for very specific polymer/surface chemistries and, as a
   consequence, are not very broadly applicable and/or do not rapidly
   respond to high-resolution stimuli such as light. We describe here the
   use of a polymeric adhesion layer, poly(styrene sulfonyl
   azide-alt-maleic anhydride) (PSSMA), which is capable of immobilizing a
   1-7 nm thick monolayer of preformed, inert polymers via photochemical
   grafting reactions. Solubility of PSSMA in very polar solvents enables
   processing alongside hydrophobic polymers or solutions and by extension
   orthogonal spin-coating deposition strategies. Therefore, these
   materials and processes are fully compatible with photolithographic
   tools and can take advantage of the immense manufacturing scalability
   they afford. For example, the thicknesses of covalently grafted
   poly(styrene) obtained after seconds of exposure are quantitatively
   equivalent to those obtained by physical adsorption after hours of
   thermal equilibration. Sequential polymer grafting steps using
   photomasks were used to pattern different regions of surface energy on
   the same substrate. These patterns spatially controlled the
   self-assembled domain orientation of a block copolymer possessing 21 nm
   half periodicity, demonstrating hierarchical synergy with leading-edge
   nanopatterning approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Fast mass transport was identified for gas through nanoscale pores,
   especially those fabricated from carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets.
   Even in porous media such as sedimentary rock, it is commonly believed
   that there exists the well-known Klinkenberg effect due to gas slip.
   Here, we use molecular simulation to show that the flow enhancement of
   methane breaks down in calcite nanopores of shale reservoirs. The
   Klinkenberg effect fails to characterize methane transport through
   interparticle pores of calcites, and the molecules travel even slower
   than the prediction of Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The comparison of
   methane transport in graphene, quartz, and calcite nanopores suggests
   that this behavior arises from the strong attractive potential and the
   lack of atomically ultrasmooth surface in calcite, thus leading to the
   presence of particles sticking at the interface. The Navier-Stokes
   equation, coupled with a negative slip length and bulk viscosity, can
   provide a reasonable description of methane flow through calcite
   nanoslits having apertures greater than 2 nm. Moreover, it is evident
   that as the pore size increases, the confined methane transforms from a
   single-file chain to two symmetrical adsorbed layers (extending to
   similar to 0.8 nm), above which a bulk fluid region is present in the
   central slit. Beyond the theoretical value, the insights gained from
   this study will advance the exploitation of shale resources and shed
   light on, more generally, mass transport in nanoporous media.}},

Title = {{Diffusion and recrystallization of B implanted in crystalline and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},

Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Although the diffusion control and dopant activation of Ge p-type
   junctions are straightforward when using B+ implantation, the use of the
   heavier BF2+ ions or even BF\_ is still favored in terms of shallow
   junction formation and throughput-because implants can be done at higher
   energies, which can give higher beam currents and beam stability-and
   thus the understanding of the effect of F co-doping becomes important.
   In this work, we have investigated diffusion and end-of-range (EOR)
   defect formation for B+, BF+, and BF2+ implants in crystalline and
   pre-amorphized Ge, employing rapid thermal annealing at 600 degrees C
   and 800 degrees C for 10 s. It is demonstrated that the diffusion of B
   is strongly influenced by the temperature, the presence of F, and the
   depth of amorphous/crystalline interface. The B and F diffusion profiles
   suggest the formation of B-F complexes and enhanced diffusion by
   interaction with point defects. In addition, the strong chemical effect
   of F is found only for B in Ge, while such an effect is vanishingly
   small for samples implanted with F alone, or co-implanted with P and F,
   as evidenced by the high residual F concentration in the B-doped samples
   after annealing. After 600 degrees C annealing for 10 s,
   interstitial-induced compressive strain was still observed in the EOR
   region for the sample implanted with BF+, as measured by X-ray
   diffraction. Further analysis by cross-sectional transmission electron
   microscopy showed that the \{311\} interstitial clusters are the
   majority type of EOR defects. The impact of these \{311\} defects on the
   electrical performance of Ge p(+)/n junctions formed by BF+ implantation
   was evaluated. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Quasielastic neutron scattering measurements and molecular dynamics
   simulations were combined to investigate the collective dynamics of
   deuterated methanol, CD3OD. In the experimentally determined dynamic
   structure factor, a slow, non-Fickian mode was observed in addition to
   the standard density-fluctuation heat mode. The simulation results
   indicate that the slow dynamical process originates from the hydrogen
   bonding of methanol molecules. The qualitative behavior of this mode is
   similar to the previously observed alpha-relaxation in supercooled water
   {[}M. C. Bellissent-Funel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 3644 (2000)]
   which also originates from the formation and dissolution of
   hydrogen-bonded associates (supramolecular clusters). In methanol,
   however, this mode is distinguishable well above the freezing
   transition. This finding indicates that an emergent slow mode is not
   unique to supercooled water, but may instead be a general feature of
   hydrogen-bonding liquids and associating molecular liquids.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleation of hydrates involves very long induction times (hours to
   days), which is a challenge for applications requiring rapid hydrate
   formation. This study introduces and analyzes the use of electric fields
   to accelerate and control hydrate nucleation. Experiments with
   tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrates reveal that the induction time can be
   reduced by 100x, by applying an electrical potential across the
   precursor solution. The induction time rapidly decreases with increasing
   voltages and is on the order of a few minutes at 100 V. It is seen that
   voltage-induced current flow in the solution is responsible for
   electronucleation. Very low currents (microamperes) are sufficient for
   electronucleation. Nucleation promotion can be attributed to phenomena
   associated with bubble formation due to chemical reactions at the
   electrodes. Overall, this study lays the foundation for the control and
   promotion of nucleation by electric fields, and enables possibilities
   for instantaneous nucleation.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fullerene (C-60) has emerged at the forefront of nanoscale
   research and application due to its unique properties. As the production
   of this nanoparticle rapidly increases, it can be released into natural
   aquatic environments and can accumulate in biological systems. This
   research examined the effects of humic acid and fetal bovine serum
   (FBS), which are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and representative
   of blood plasma in living organisms, respectively, on bioavailability of
   fullerene. Bioavailability was investigated using in vitro methods for
   lipid membrane accumulation and cellular uptake studies. Humic acid and
   FBS significantly changed the characteristics of fullerene including its
   particle size and surface charge. The effects of humic acid on lipid
   accumulation of fullerene depended on the lipid head charge. FBS also
   significantly decreased the lipid accumulation when positively charged
   and zwitterionic head groups were present on the lipids, possibly due to
   the higher steric repulsion of the protein coated nanoparticles.
   addition, both humic acid and FBS protein effectively lowered the
   amounts of fullerene taken up by Caco-2 cells, which are derived from a
   human colorectal adenocarcinoma and have similar functions to the small
   intestinal epithelium. Results of this study suggest that surface
   modification of fullerene by environmentally relevant matrices can
   significantly affect the biological transport, as well as the possible
   toxicity of this nanomaterial.}},

   (x = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) and LiMn1.75Ni0.25O4 at 25 degrees C were
   measured by high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry and were
   found to be strongly exothermic. Increasing the Cr, Co, and Ni content
   leads to more thermodynamically stable spinels, but increasing the Fe
   content does not significantly affect the stability. The formation
   enthalpies from oxides of the fully substituted spinels, LiMnMO4 (M =
   Cr, Fe and Co), become more exothermic (implying increasing stability)
   with decreasing ionic radius of the metal and lattice parameters of the
   spinel. The trend in enthalpy versus metal content is roughly linear,
   suggesting a close-to-zero heat of mixing in LiMn2O4-LiMnMO4 solid

Abstract = {{Musculoskeletal models and forward dynamics simulations of human
   movement often include foot-ground interactions, with the foot-ground
   contact forces often determined using a constitutive model that depends
   on material properties and contact kinematics. When using soft
   constraints to model the foot-ground interactions, the kinematics of the
   minimum distance between the foot and planar ground needs to be
   computed. Due to their geometric simplicity, a considerable number of
   studies have used point-plane elements to represent these interacting
   bodies, but few studies have provided comparisons between point contact
   elements and other geometrically based analytical solutions. The
   objective of this work was to develop a more general-purpose
   superellipsoid-plane contact model that can be used to determine the
   three-dimensional foot-ground contact forces. As an example application,
   the model was used in a forward dynamics simulation of human walking.
   Simulation results and execution times were compared with a point-like
   viscoelastic contact model. Both models produced realistic ground
   reaction forces and kinematics with similar computational efficiency.
   However, solving the equations of motion with the surface contact model
   was found to be more efficient (\~{}18\% faster), and on average
   numerically \~{}37\% less stiff. The superellipsoid-plane elements are
   also more versatile than point-like elements in that they allow for
   volumetric contact during three-dimensional motions (e.g. rotating,
   rolling, and sliding). In addition, the superellipsoid-plane element is
   geometrically accurate and easily integrated within multibody simulation
   code. These advantages make the use of superellipsoid-plane contact
   models in musculoskeletal simulations an appealing alternative to
   point-like elements.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of user-facing applications is critical to client
   platforms. Many of these applications are event-driven and exhibit
   ``bursty{''} behavior: the application is generally idle but generates
   bursts of activity in response to human interaction. We study one
   example of a bursty application, web-browsers, and produce two important
   insights: (1) Activity bursts contain false parallelism, bringing many
   cores out of a deep sleep to inefficiently render a single webpage, and
   (2) these bursts are highly compute driven, and thus scale nearly
   linearly with frequency. We show average performance gains/energy
   reductions of 14\%/17\% respectively on real hardware by statically
   moving threads from multiple cores to a single core. We then propose
   dynamic hardware driven thread migration and scheduling enhancements
   that detect these bursts, leading to further benefits.}},

Abstract = {{A facile pure sulfur electrode strategy is demonstrated to increase the

   Benefiting from the unique pure sulfur electrode and an upper current
   collector design, the pure sulfur electrode displays low polarization,
   high sulfur utilization, and promising cycling stability even with an
   ultrahigh sulfur loading. A high areal capacity of 19.2 mAh cm(-2) has
   been achieved, which is the highest areal capacity for the reported
   blade-cast sulfur electrodes and 4 times higher than that of available
   lithium-ion battery electrodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use
   of large-sized sulfur particles only slightly decreases the rate of
   conversion from S-8 to S-4(2-) during the initial discharge and has
   negligible impact on subsequent electrochemical performance.}},

Abstract = {{Due to lithium-sulfur battery's high theoretical capacity and energy
   density, Li-S has been considered as a promising candidate for
   next-generation Li batteries. Despite this, Li-S batteries suffer from
   poor electrical conductivity and the shuttle effect, which result in
   loss of active material and active material loading limitation, thus
   hindering the practical application of Li-S. This Letter introduces the
   modified high sulfur-loading electrode (MHSE) with a loading of 10 mg
   cm(-2) which directly addresses these two drawbacks and employs a simple
   production process suitable for mass production through the use of
   elemental sulfur. The MHSE consists of three distinct components which
   provide additional conductivity, mechanical support, and polysulfide
   adsorption ability on each level to enhance electrochemical performance.
   The electrode manifested an initial discharge capacity of 1332 mAh g(-1)
   with a 91\% cycle retention at the end of 50 cycles and cycled with
   stability from 0.1C to 2C during rate capability testing.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen evolution catalysts composed of a metal (Ni, Co, or Fe) and a
   pnictide or chalcogenide (P, S, or Se) counterion are a promising class
   of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an
   important reaction for the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. We
   synthesized a nickel-based oxygen evolution catalyst derived from
   pulse-electrodeposited nickel sulfide. This catalyst was found to
   produce current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) at the relatively low
   overpotential of 320 mV in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH). Importantly,
   we found that the sulfur anion in the nickel sulfide is depleted in the
   active form of the electrocatalyst and that the NiS is converted into an
   amorphous nickel oxide in the potential range where water is oxidized to
   oxygen. The superior catalytic activity of this nickel sulfide is thus
   unrelated to the sulfur anions in the active catalyst but is instead
   related to the metal sulfide's ability to act as a precursor to a highly
   active nickel oxide OER electrocatalyst. The nickel oxide derived from
   nickel sulfide was found to be amorphous with a relatively high surface
   area, two factors that have been previously shown to be important in
   oxygen evolution electrocatalysis.}},

Title = {{Modeling relative permeability of water in soil: Application of

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of the relative permeability to water under
   partially saturated condition has broad applications and has been
   studied intensively since the 1940s by petroleum, chemical, and civil
   engineers, as well as hydrologists and soil scientists. Many models have
   been developed for this purpose, ranging from those that represent the
   pore space as a bundle of capillary tubes, to those that utilize complex
   networks of interconnected pore bodies and pore throats with various
   cross-section shapes. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the
   effective-medium approximation (EMA) and percolation theory in order to
   predict the water relative permeability. The approach is general and
   applicable to any type of porous media. We use the method to compute the
   water relative permeability in porous media whose pore-size distribution
   follows a power law. The EMA is invoked to predict the relative
   permeability from the fully saturated pore space to some intermediate
   water saturation that represents a crossover from the EMA to what we
   refer to as the ``critical region.'' In the critical region below the
   crossover water saturation S-wx, but still above the critical water
   saturation S-wc (the residual saturation or the percolation threshold of
   the water phase), the universal power law predicted by percolation
   theory is used to compute the relative permeability. To evaluate the
   accuracy of the approach, data for 21 sets of undisturbed laboratory
   samples were selected from the UNSODA database. For 14 cases, the
   predicted relative permeabilities are in good agreement with the data.
   For the remaining seven samples, however, the theory underestimates the
   relative permeabilities. Some plausible sources of the discrepancy are
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Scalable subsurface inverse modeling of huge data sets with an
   application to tracer concentration breakthrough data from magnetic
   resonance imaging}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing subsurface properties is crucial for reliable and
   cost-effective groundwater supply management and contaminant
   remediation. With recent advances in sensor technology, large volumes of
   hydrogeophysical and geochemical data can be obtained to achieve
   high-resolution images of subsurface properties. However,
   characterization with such a large amount of information requires
   prohibitive computational costs associated with ``big data'' processing
   and numerous large-scale numerical simulations. To tackle such
   difficulties, the principal component geostatistical approach (PCGA) has
   been proposed as a ``Jacobian-free'' inversion method that requires much
   smaller forward simulation runs for each iteration than the number of
   unknown parameters and measurements needed in the traditional inversion
   methods. PCGA can be conveniently linked to any multiphysics simulation
   software with independent parallel executions. In this paper, we extend
   PCGA to handle a large number of measurements (e.g., 106 or more) by
   constructing a fast preconditioner whose computational cost scales
   linearly with the data size. For illustration, we characterize the
   heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity (K) distribution in a
   laboratory-scale 3-D sand box using about 6 million transient tracer
   concentration measurements obtained using magnetic resonance imaging.
   Since each individual observation has little information on the K
   distribution, the data were compressed by the zeroth temporal moment of
   breakthrough curves, which is equivalent to the mean travel time under
   the experimental setting. Only about 2000 forward simulations in total
   were required to obtain the best estimate with corresponding estimation
   uncertainty, and the estimated K field captured key patterns of the
   original packing design, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a new rock-physics model based on a combination of
   effective medium theories to reconstruct rock fabric, and we have
   estimated the elastic properties of laminated hydrocarbon-bearing
   shales. This innovative model is based on the separate treatment of
   isotropic sandstone and vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) shale
   volumes of each layer; the model reproduces many typical properties of
   laminated shales, such as alignment of cracks, alignment of clay
   platelets, distinction between isolated and connected porosity, and
   presence of fractures. Moreover, the model enables the simulation of
   Stoneley velocity based on the estimated stiffness of the rock in
   addition to compressional and shear velocities commonly calculated with
   rock-physics models. Finally, it is a joint model that also calculates
   vertical and horizontal electrical resistivity while keeping a
   consistent microstructure for the elastic and resistivity simulations,
   thereby decreasing nonuniqueness of the solution. Nonuniqueness is an
   inherent flaw of effective medium modeling and has rarely been addressed
   in previous studies. Our simulations assumed VTI elastic behavior and
   suggested the presence of compliant horizontal pores and natural
   fractures. Our model was then validated by comparing computed properties
   against compressional and shear velocity and, when available, Stoneley
   velocity and resistivity logs. Our simulation method is implemented in
   two wells in the Haynesville Shale and in one well in the Barnett Shale,
   giving rise to accurate estimates of wave velocities, with errors lower
   than 5.9\% for wells in the Haynesville Shale and 3.8\% difference for
   the well in the Barnett Shale. Identification of suitable depth zones to
   drill a horizontal well or to initiate fractures is then based on the
   inferred elastic properties of the rocks.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the ability of low-frequency induction resistivity
   measurements to detect and appraise hydraulic fractures induced near
   vertical boreholes. Integral-equation-based simulations indicate that
   coplanar measurements can detect fractures when they are injected with
   electrically conductive proppant to increase their conductivity contrast
   with the shale background. Specifically, when a logging tool consisting
   of one transmitter and two receivers that are 1.2 and 1.5 m away is used
   to detect fractures with the effective electrical conductivity of 100
   S/m in a homogeneous shale formation of 1/3 S/m conductivity, the
   measurements (1) can indicate the boundary of fractures intersecting
   with vertical boreholes by the signal spikes generated only when the
   tool enters/exits fractures, (2) can detect fractures as small as
   approximately 0.15 m and differentiate fractures up to approximately 10
   m in width, (3) can detect fractures with height as small as 0.3 m, (4)
   can differentiate elliptical and rectangular fractures from each other
   if they exhibit the same width; e.g., they can discriminate if their
   widths are within approximately 0.4-10 m, and (5) are sensitive to the
   effective electrical conductivity of the fracture. A second logging tool
   consisting of one transmitter and two receivers that are 18 and 19.2 m
   away is found to be less useful in the detection and appraisal of
   hydraulic fractures induced near vertical boreholes.}},

Title = {{Epitaxial Growth of Perovskite Strontium Titanate on Germanium via
   Atomic Layer Deposition}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{113}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a commercially utilized deposition
   method for electronic materials. ALD growth of thin films offers
   thickness control and conformality by taking advantage of self-limiting
   reactions between vapor-phase precursors and the growing film.
   Perovskite oxides present potential for next-generation electronic
   materials, but to-date have mostly been deposited by physical methods.
   This work outlines a method for depositing SrTiO3 (STO) on germanium
   using ALD. Germanium has higher carrier mobilities than silicon and
   therefore offers an alternative semiconductor material with faster
   device operation. This method takes advantage of the instability of
   germanium's native oxide by using thermal deoxidation to clean and
   reconstruct the Ge (001) surface to the 2x1 structure. 2-nm thick,
   amorphous STO is then deposited by ALD. The STO film is annealed under
   ultra-high vacuum and crystallizes on the reconstructed Ge surface.
   Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is used during this
   annealing step to monitor the STO crystallization. The thin, crystalline
   layer of STO acts as a template for subsequent growth of STO that is
   crystalline as-grown, as confirmed by RHEED. In situ X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy is used to verify film stoichiometry before and after the
   annealing step, as well as after subsequent STO growth. This procedure
   provides framework for additional perovskite oxides to be deposited on
   semiconductors via chemical methods in addition to the integration of
   more sophisticated heterostructures already achievable by physical
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{The practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries is usually
   hindered by the unstable discharge intermediates and the low
   conductivity of the sulfur cathode. Herein, we propose to improve the
   performance of the sulfur cathode by introducing a built-in carbon
   nanotube network inside a biomass-derived hierarchically porous carbon
   for the subsequent sulfur loading. This balanced structural design of
   the carbon substrate enables effective trapping of active sulfur within
   the cathode and provides a highly efficient pathway for electron
   transmission, contributing to an increased conductivity and structural
   integrity of the cathode. By using a potentiostatic process at the end
   of charge, the reversibility of the electrode reaction of sulfur is
   improved. The sulfur cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of
   1739 mA hg(-1) and reaches a high initial Columbic efficiency of 87.6
   \%, and maintains its efficiency to >97.5\% from the 2nd cycle. It also
   shows admirable cycling and rate performance.}},

Title = {{PARR: Pin-Access Planning and Regular Routing for Self-Aligned Double
   Patterning}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Pin access has become one of the most difficult challenges for detailed
   routing in advanced technology nodes, for example, in 14nm and below,
   for which double-patterning lithography has to be used for manufacturing
   lower metal routing layers with tight pitches, such as M2 and M3.
   Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) provides better control on line
   edge roughness and overlay, but it has very restrictive design
   constraints and prefers regular layout patterns. This article presents a
   comprehensive pin-access planning and regular routing framework (PARR)
   for SADP friendliness. Our key techniques include precomputation of both
   intracell and intercell pin accessibility, as well as local and global
   pin-access planning to enable handshaking between standard cell-level
   pin access and detailed routing under SADP constraints. A pin
   access-driven rip-up and reroute scheme is proposed to improve the
   ultimate routability. Our experimental results demonstrate that PARR can
   achieve much better routability and overlay control compared with
   previous approaches.}},

Title = {{Annual block scheduling for internal medicine residents with 4+1
   templates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{911-927}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Internal Medicine residency programmes have traditionally been
   structured around monthly or 4-week blocks where a different rotation is
   assigned to each block over the year. A subset of those rotations carry
   the requirement of one or two half-day sessions of clinic duty per week.
   In the last several years, a growing number of Internal Medicine
   residency programmes have moved away from this traditional structure and
   have adopted an `X + Y' template, where the resident spends X weeks on a
   rotation without clinic duty and then Y weeks mostly in clinic. This
   paper addresses the `4 + 1' annual block scheduling problem as adopted
   by the Department of Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science
   Center in San Antonio (UTHSC-SA). We believe it is the first attempt to
   investigate the problem formally; specifically, we develop a series of
   optimization models that can be used to construct individual block
   schedules for the academic year and to assign clinic sessions to the
   residents during their ambulatory week. (At UTHSC-SA, Internal Medicine
   residents are divided into five groups to match the 4 + 1 pattern, and
   scheduled so only one group at a time has clinic responsibilities each
   of the 52 weeks.) The objective is to balance the workload during the
   half-day clinic sessions and to ensure that each resident receives
   roughly the same training experiences over their programme. Once the
   blocks and groups are known, a second optimization problem is solved to
   determine individual clinic session assignments. The basic model takes
   the form of a mixed-integer program but was not solvable with commercial
   software. After decomposing it into two parts, we were able to find
   optimal solutions to the original problem. Complexity results are
   provided for the problems solved. Compared with current practice, our
   decomposition approach was seen to offer improved schedules with respect
   to the workload balance objective for each of the five resident groups.}},

Abstract = {{1A computational modeling study of high-voltage nanosecond pulsed

   observed to develop as two streamers originating from the cathode and
   the anode, and propagating toward each other until they merge to form a
   single continuous discharge channel. The peak plasma density obtained in
   the simulations is similar to 10(24) m(-3), i.e., the ionization degree
   of plasma does not exceed 1\%. The influence of the initial gas
   pre-ionization is established. It is seen that an increase in the seeded
   plasma density results in an increase in the streamer propagation
   velocity and an increase in the plasma density obtained after the
   merging of two streamers. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

   Solutions for Enhanced Oil Recovery}},

Abstract = {{Polymer flooding is now considered a technically-and commercially-proven
   method for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The viscosity of the injected
   polymer solution is the key property for successful polymer flooding.
   Given that the viscosity of a polymer solution has a non-linear
   relationship with various influential parameters (molecular weight,
   degree of hydrolysis, polymer concentration, cation concentration of
   polymer solution, shear rate, temperature) and that measurement of
   viscosity based on these parameters is a time-consuming process, the
   range of solution samples and the measurement conditions need to be
   limited and precise. Viscosity estimation of the polymer solution is
   effective for these purposes. An artificial neural network (ANN) was
   applied to the viscosity estimation of Flopaam (TM) 3330S, Flopaam (TM)
   3630S and AN-125 solutions, three commonly-used EOR polymers. The
   viscosities measured and estimated by ANN and the Carreau model using
   Lee's correlation, the only method for estimating the viscosity of an
   EOR polymer solution in unmeasured conditions, were compared. Estimation
   accuracy was evaluated by the average absolute relative deviation, which
   has been widely used for accuracy evaluation of the results of ANN
   models. In all conditions, the accuracy of the ANN model is higher than
   that of the Carreau model using Lee's correlation.}},

Title = {{Diagnosis of Thin-Capped Fibroatheromas in Intravascular Optical
   Coherence Tomography Images Effects of Light Scattering}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Background-Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) images are
   recorded by detecting light backscattered within coronary arteries. We
   hypothesize that non-thin-capped fibroatheroma (TCFA) causes may scatter
   light to create the false appearance of IVOCT TCFA.
   Methods and Results-Ten human cadaver hearts were imaged with IVOCT
   (n=14 coronary arteries). IVOCT and histological TCFA images were
   coregistered and compared. Of 21 IVOCT TCFAs (fibrous cap <65 mu m,
   lipid arc > 1 quadrant), only 8 were true histological TCFA. Foam cell
   infiltration was responsible for 70\% of false IVOCT TCFA and caused
   both thick-capped fibroatheromas to appear as TCFA, and the appearance
   of TCFAs when no lipid core was present. Other false IVOCT TCFA causes
   included smooth muscle cell-rich fibrous tissue (12\%) and loose
   connective tissue (9\%). If the lipid arc >1 quadrant (obtuse) criterion
   was disregarded, 45 IVOCT TCFAs were identified, and sensitivity of
   IVOCT TCFA detection increased from 63\% to 87\%, and specificity
   remained high at 92\%.
   Conclusions-We demonstrate that IVOCT can exhibit 87\% (95\% CI,
   75\%-93\%) sensitivity and 92\% specificity (95\% CI, 86\%-96\%) to
   detect all lipid arcs (both obtuse and acute, <1 quadrant) TCFA, and we
   also propose new mechanisms involving light scattering that explain why
   other plaque components can masquerade as TCFA and cause low positive
   predictive value of IVOCT for TCFA detection (47\% for obtuse lipid
   arcs). Disregarding the lipid arc > 1 quadrant requirement enhances the
   ability of IVOCT to detect TCFA.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a performance analysis of a finite-sized
   co-operative wireless system, where a group of transmitters with
   unreliable backhauls serve a desired receiver using noncoherent joint
   transmission. To facilitate analysis, an analytical expression for the
   distribution of the spatially averaged signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio ( SA-SINR) is derived in terms of key system and channel
   parameters. Leveraging the derived expression, the joint impact of node
   co-operation, backhaul reliability, interference, and communication
   range is investigated in the considered finite-sized co-operative
   system. Furthermore, based on the SA-SINR, closed form expressions for
   the average bit error rate ( ABER) and average spectral efficiency (
   ASE) are derived. Further insights are established by analyzing the
   asymptotic performance in the high transmission power regime. From
   analytical derivations for the outage probability, ABER, and ASE and
   link-level simulations, it is verified that these asymptotic performance
   metrics are exclusively influenced by unreliable backhauls, so that the
   conventional diversity gains are not achievable.}},

Abstract = {{We consider optimization problems whose parameters are known only
   approximately, based on noisy samples. In large-scale applications, the
   number of samples one can collect is typically of the same order of (or
   even less than) the dimensionality of the problem. This so-called
   high-dimensional statistical regime has been the object of intense
   recent research in machine learning and statistics, primarily due to
   phenomena inherent to this regime, such as the fact that the noise one
   sees here often dwarfs the magnitude of the signal itself. While
   relevant in numerous important operations research and engineering
   optimization applications, this setup falls far outside the traditional
   scope of robust and stochastic optimization. We propose three algorithms
   to address this setting, combining ideas from statistics, machine
   learning, and robust optimization. Our algorithms are motivated by three
   natural optimization objectives: minimizing the number of grossly
   violated constraints; maximizing the number of exactly satisfied
   constraints; and, finally, developing algorithms whose running time
   scales with the intrinsic dimension of a problem, as opposed to its
   observed dimension-a mismatch that, as we discuss in detail, can be dire
   in settings where constraints are meant to describe preferences of
   behaviors. The key ingredients of our algorithms are dimensionality
   reduction techniques from machine learning, robust optimization, and
   concentration of measure tools from statistics.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The human intestine is a dynamic organ where the complex host-microbe
   interactions that orchestrate intestinal homeostasis occur. Major
   contributing factors associated with intestinal health and diseases
   include metabolically-active gut microbiota, intestinal epithelium,
   immune components, and rhythmical bowel movement known as peristalsis.
   Human intestinal disease models have been developed; however, a
   considerable number of existing models often fail to reproducibly
   predict human intestinal pathophysiology in response to biological and
   chemical perturbations or clinical interventions. Intestinal organoid
   models have provided promising cytodifferentiation and regeneration, but
   the lack of luminal flow and physical bowel movements seriously hamper
   mimicking complex host-microbe crosstalk. Here, we discuss recent
   advances of human intestinal microphysiological systems, such as the
   biomimetic human ``Gut-on-a-Chip{''} that can employ key intestinal
   components, such as villus epithelium, gut microbiota, and immune
   components under peristalsis-like motions and flow, to reconstitute the
   transmural 3D lumen-capillary tissue interface. By encompassing
   cutting-edge tools in microfluidics, tissue engineering, and clinical
   microbiology, gut-on-a-chip has been leveraged not only to recapitulate
   organ-level intestinal functions, but also emulate the pathophysiology
   of intestinal disorders, such as chronic inflammation. Finally, we
   provide potential perspectives of the next generation microphysiological
   systems as a personalized platform to validate the efficacy, safety,
   metabolism, and therapeutic responses of new drug compounds in the
   preclinical stage.}},

   AlxIn1-xAsySb1-y films and from AlxIn1-xAsySb1-y/GaSb type-II
   superlattices were used to determine the direct bandgap and the band
   offsets as a function of the aluminum fraction. Varying the aluminum
   content tuned the direct bandgap from 0.25 eV (0\% aluminum) to 1.24 eV
   (75\% aluminum), corresponding to photon wavelengths from 5000 to 1000
   nm, with the transition from direct-gap to indirect-gap occurring at
   similar to 1.18 eV (similar to 72\% aluminum), or 1050 nm. This direct
   gap tuning range of 0.93 eV is the largest reported for a III-V alloy

Abstract = {{Methane is a greenhouse gas, and increases in atmospheric methane
   concentration over the past 250 years have driven increased radiative
   forcing of the atmosphere. Increases in atmospheric methane
   concentration since 1750 account for approximately 17\% of increases in
   radiative forcing of the atmosphere, and that percentage increases by
   approximately a factor of 2 if the effects of the greenhouse gases
   produced by the atmospheric reactions of methane are included in the
   assessment. Because of the role of methane emissions in radiative
   forcing of the atmosphere, the identification and quantification of
   sources of methane emissions is receiving increased scientific
   attention. Methane emission sources include biogenic, geogenic, and
   anthropogenic sources; the largest anthropogenic sources are natural gas
   and petroleum systems, enteric fermentation (livestock), landfills, coal
   mining, and manure management. While these source categories are
   well-known, there is significant uncertainty in the relative magnitudes
   of methane emissions from the various source categories. Further, the
   overall magnitude of methane emissions from all anthropogenic sources is
   actively debated, with estimates based on source sampling extrapolated
   to regional or national scale ({''}bottom-up analyses{''}) differing
   from estimates that infer emissions based on ambient data ({''}top-down
   analyses{''}) by 50\% or more.
   To address the important problem of attribution of methane to specific
   sources, a variety of new analytical methods are being employed,
   including high time resolution and highly sensitive measurements of
   methane, methane isotopes, and other chemical species frequently
   associated with methane emissions, such as ethane. This Account
   describes the use of some of these emerging measurements, in both
   top-down and bottom-up methane emission studies. In addition, this
   Account describes how data from these new analytical methods can be used
   in conjunction with chemical mass balance (CMB) methods for source
   attribution. CMB methods have been developed over the past several
   decades to quantify sources of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
   and atmospheric particulate matter. These emerging capabilities for
   making measurements of methane and species coemitted with methane,
   rapidly, precisely, and at relatively low cost, used together with CMB
   methods of source attribution can lead to a better understanding of
   methane emission sources. Application of the CMB approach to source
   attribution in the Barnett Shale oil and gas production region in Texas
   demonstrates both the importance of extensive and simultaneous source
   testing in the region being analyzed and the potential of CMB method to
   quantify the relative strengths of methane emission sources.}},

Abstract = {{Total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation can cause potentially fatal
   Gas Bubble Disease (GBD) in fish and is recognized for its severe
   environmental impact for high-dam operation conditions. The generation
   of supersaturated TDG in high-head hydropower project is substantially
   different from middle- or low-head projects that have been previously
   studied. Although the mechanics of TDG generation in a plunge pool are
   clearly three-dimensional (3D), there are great challenges and
   difficulties of the 3D simulation for high-dam projects. Toward this
   end, a two-dimensional (2D) model of two-phase flow in high-dam plunge
   pool is developed with established computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   software. New simulation modules are developed to account for a normal
   distribution of bubble sizes, which allows the TDG mass transfer from
   bubbles and across the free surface to include bubble size
   nonlinearities that were previously neglected. The model is calibrated
   based on observations from a high-dam hydropower project with a ski-jump
   spillway and deep plunge pool. Characteristics of simulated
   hydrodynamics, air-bubble distribution, and TDG distribution downstream
   of the high dam were analyzed. Results showed that the model achieved
   satisfactory calibrated simulation of dissolved gas behavior and the
   assumption of a bubble normal distribution could properly reflect the
   bubble transfer process. Residence time in the plunge pool appeared to
   be a key factor determining maximum modeled TDG supersaturation levels.

Abstract = {{Gene expression requires the coordination of trans-acting factors and
   cis-DNA elements to initiate transcription. Here we present a
   coordinated approach that combines cis-acting element engineering with
   mutant trans-acting factors to engineer yeast promoters. Specifically,
   we first construct a hybrid promoter based on the ARO9 upstream region
   that exhibits high constitutive and inducible expression with respect to
   exogenous tryptophan. Next, we perform protein engineering to identify a
   mutant Aro80p that affords both high constitutive expression while
   retaining inducible traits. We then use this mutant trans-acting factor
   to drive expression and generate ultra-strong promoters with
   transcriptional output roughly 2 fold higher than TDH3 (GPD), one of the
   strongest promoters to-date. Finally, we used this element to construct
   a modular expression system capable of staged outputs resulting in a
   system with nearly 6-fold, 12-fold and 15-fold expression relative to
   the off-state. This work further highlights the potential of using
   endogenous transcription factors (including mutant factors) along with
   hybrid promoters to expand the yeast synthetic biology toolbox.}},

Title = {{Analysis of steel bolted double angle connections at elevated
   temperatures}},
Journal = {{FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{79-89}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Double angle connections are one of the common simple beam-end framing
   connections used in steel structures, but current building standards do
   not provide much guidance on how to design these connections for fire.
   Development of such design methodologies is particularly hindered by the
   lack of adequate understanding of the strength and deformation
   capacities of double angle connections in fire. To address this issue,
   this paper presents key results of a computational study of the
   influence of fire temperatures on steel double angle connections.
   Computational models for double angle connections are developed in
   Abaqus and evaluated against experimental data from the literature at
   both ambient and elevated temperatures. An extensive study is then
   conducted to investigate different parameters that impact the behavior
   of double angle connection assemblies during a fire. A comparison is
   also made between the performances of double angle and shear tab
   connections at elevated temperatures. Results obtained in this study
   show that the main factors impacting the behavior of double angle
   connections at elevated temperatures are load ratio, initial cooling
   temperature, location of the double angle with respect to the beam
   neutral axis, and the gap distance. In addition, double angle
   connections showed better performance at elevated temperatures when
   compared to shear tab connections. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Various factors influence the rheology of cementitious pastes, with the
   most important being the mixing protocol, mixture proportions, and
   mixture composition. This study investigated the influence of
   ground-granulated blast-furnace slag, on the rheological behavior of
   cementitious pastes. In tandem with the rheological measurements, fresh
   state microstructural measurements were conducted using three different
   techniques: A coupled stroboscope-rheometer, a coupled laser
   backscattering-rheometer, and a conventional laser diffraction
   technique. Laser diffraction and the coupled stroboscope-rheometer were
   not good measures of the in situ state of flocculation of a sample.
   Rather, only the laser backscattering technique allowed for in situ
   measurement on a highly concentrated suspension ( cementitious paste).
   Using the coupled laser backscattering-rheometer technique, a link
   between the particle system and rheological behavior was determined
   through a modeling approach that takes into account agglomeration
   properties. A higher degree of agglomeration was seen in the ordinary
   Portland cement paste than pastes containing the slag and this was
   related to the degree of capillary pressure in the paste systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Nucleation and film growth characteristics are reported during chemical
   vapor deposition of Ru on SiO2 using triruthenium dodecacarbonyl
   {[}Ru-3(CO)(12)] and ruthenium bis(di-t-butylacetamidinate) dicarbonyl
   {[}Ru(Bu-t-Me-amd)(2)(CO)(2)]. Films grown from Ru-3(CO)(12) follow the
   three dimensional (3D) Volmer-Weber growth mode. In contrast, films
   grown from Ru(Bu-t-Me-amd)(2)(CO)(2) follow the pseudo-layer-by-layer
   growth mode with two dimensional wetting layer islands forming before 3D
   particle growth is observed on the islands. A relationship between free
   isolated hydroxyl {[}(SiOH) i] group density and Ru nucleation density
   is found for Ru-3(CO)(12) and is associated with (SiOH) i acting as the
   reaction sites for activation of Ru-3(CO)(12) and in turn generating an
   adjustable adatom concentration. Carbon monoxide and ammonia addition to
   the gas phase during film growth from Ru(Bu-t-Me-amd)(2)(CO)(2) lead to
   smoother films by inducing surface reconstructions during the 3D phase
   of pseudo-layer-by-layer growth; these gases also lead to films with
   lower resistivity and lower crystalline character. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{The smallness of natural molecules and atoms with respect to the
   wavelength of light imposes severe limits on the nature of their optical
   response. For example, the well-known argument of Landau and Lifshitz
   and its recent extensions that include chiral molecules show that the
   electric dipole response dominates over the magneto-electric
   (bianisotropic) and an even smaller magnetic dipole optical response for
   all natural materials. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that both
   these responses can be greatly enhanced in plasmonic nanoclusters. Using
   atomic force microscopy nanomanipulation technique, we assemble a
   plasmonic metamolecule that is designed for strong and simultaneous
   optical magnetic and magneto-electric excitation. Angle-dependent
   scattering spectroscopy is used to disentangle the two responses and to
   demonstrate that their constructive/destructive interplay causes strong
   directional scattering asymmetry. This asymmetry is used to extract both
   magneto-electric and magnetic dipole responses and to demonstrate their
   enhancement in comparison to ordinary atomistic materials.}},

Abstract = {{Substitution of selenium for sulfur in the cathode of a rechargeable

   chemical reaction is characterized by a continuous chain shortening of
   Se-x upon initial discharge before completing the reduction to Na2Se; on
   charge, the reconstituted Se-x molecules retain a smaller x value than
   the original Se-x chain molecule. In both cases, the Se molecules remain
   almost completely confined to the micropore slits to give a long cycle

Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted in which five identical, full-scale
   bulb-T bridge girders were constructed and tested to shear failure.
   Although the shear span was kept the same for all of the tests (a = 3d),
   the distance from the end of the specimen to the center of the support
   bearing (overhang length) was varied. Varying the overhang length
   controlled whether or not the critical section subject to shear fell
   within the transfer length, which affected whether the specimen failure
   was caused by a traditional shear mechanism (web crushing,
   flexure-shear, etc.) or a nontraditional shear mechanism (e.g.,
   horizontal shear or shear failure induced by anchorage zone distress).
   The shear failure values were compared with each other to investigate
   whether nontraditional shear mechanisms result in a lower capacity than
   traditional mechanisms. These values were also compared with nominal
   design capacities related to each different failure mechanism.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents practical guidance and resources for use during the
   construction phase developed by the Construction Industry Institute
   (CII) Research Team (RT) 304, Sustainability Practices and Metrics for
   the Construction Phase of Capital Projects. It introduces 54
   construction phase sustainability actions (CPSAs) that project teams can
   use during project execution to prioritize and carry out sustainability
   solutions. Further, it discusses the results of the sustainability
   survey on current and future capital project implementation of CPSAs,
   with a focus on frequency of use and barriers to deployment. By
   following the guidance provided here for adopting these CPSAs, owners
   and contractors will be better prepared to implement sustainability
   actions during the construction phase of their capital projects. This
   paper's primary contributions are the identification of
   construction-related decisions and actions to advance sustainability
   implementation, the provision of detailed practical guidance for
   effective application, and the validation of the 54 CPSAs in the catalog
   based on the frequency of current and likely future application.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
   method for solving nonlinear Korteweg-de Vries type equations. Similar
   to a standard HDG implementation, we first express the approximate
   variables and numerical fluxes inside each element in terms of the
   approximate traces of the scalar variable (u), and its first derivative
   (u(x)). These traces are assumed to be single-valued on each face. Next,
   we impose the conservation of numerical fluxes via two extra sets of
   equations. Using these global flux conservation conditions and applying
   the Newton-Raphson method, we construct a system of equations that can
   be solely expressed in terms of the increments of approximate traces in
   each iteration. Afterwards, we solve these equations, and substitute the
   approximate traces back into local equations over each element to obtain
   local approximate solutions. As for the time stepping scheme, we use the
   backward difference formulae. The method is proved to be stable for a
   proper choice of stabilization parameters. Through numerical examples,
   we observe that for a mesh with kth order elements, the computed u, p,
   and q show optimal convergence at order k + 1 in both linear and
   nonlinear cases, which improves upon previously employed techniques.}},

   as reservation based intersection controls and dynamic lane reversal. We
   present a cell transmission model formulation for dynamic lane reversal.
   For deterministic demand, we formulate the dynamic lane reversal control
   problem for a single link as an integer program and derive theoretical
   results. In reality, demand is not known perfectly at arbitrary times in
   the future. To address stochastic demand, we present a Markov decision
   process formulation. Due to the large state size, the Markov decision
   process is intractable. However, based on theoretical results from the
   integer program, we derive an effective heuristic. We demonstrate
   significant improvements over a fixed lane configuration both on a
   single bottleneck link with varying demands, and on the downtown Austin
   network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Ontology for Querying Heterogeneous Data Sources in Freight
   Transportation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Navigating through multiple heterogeneous freight data sources to find
   the ones that are relevant to answering a question can be a challenging
   task when performed manually. It is highly dependent on the individual's
   knowledge of all available data sources and the information contained in
   each one. Multiple factors contribute to freight data heterogeneity,
   including differences in data element definitions, level of
   disaggregation, and classification systems. This paper proposes a
   standardized knowledge representation of freight data sources using an
   ontology that both computer systems and domain experts can understand.
   The ontology is developed from a formal representation of data elements
   found to exist in freight data sources. The paper also presents a
   querying algorithm for searching through the ontology and determining
   relevant freight data sources that can be used for answering user
   queries. The proposed ontology and querying algorithm facilitate the
   querying and identification of relevant freight data sources without the
   need for an extensive knowledge of the contents and organization of each
   data source. Issues relating to semantic heterogeneity inherent in
   freight data elements and gaps in existing freight data sources are also
   identified through the use of the ontology and querying algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The solution to a completely hypersensitive optimal control problem may
   shadow trajectories on the stable and unstable manifolds of an
   equilibrium point in the state-costate phase space. If such shadowing
   occurs, the solution of the Hamiltonian boundary value problem, that
   constitutes the first-order necessary conditions for optimality, can be
   approximated as a composite of an initial segment on the stable manifold
   leading to the equilibrium point and a final segment on the unstable
   manifold departing from the equilibrium point. Using a dichotomic basis,
   the Hamiltonian vector field can be decomposed into stable and unstable
   components, and the unspecified boundary conditions for the initial and
   terminal segments can be determined such that the initial and final
   conditions are, respectively, on the stable and unstable manifolds of
   the equilibrium point. In this paper, we propose and justify the use of
   finite-time Lyapunov vectors to construct an approximate dichotomic
   basis and develop a corresponding manifold-following solution
   approximation method. The method is illustrated on two examples and
   shown to be more accurate than a similar method that uses eigenvectors
   of the frozen-time linearized dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging of cellular electric potential via calcium-ion sensitive
   contrast agents is a useful tool, but current techniques lack sufficient
   depth penetration. We explore contrast-enhanced photoacoustic (PA)
   imaging, using Arsenazo III dye, to visualize cardiac myocyte
   depolarization in vitro. Phantom results show strong linearity of PA
   signal with dye concentration (R-2 > 0.95), and agree spectrally with
   extinction measurements with varying calcium concentration. Cell studies
   indicate a significant (>100-fold) increase in PA signal for dye-treated
   cells, as well as a 10-fold increase in peak-to-peak variation during a
   30 s window. This suggests contrast-enhanced PA imaging may have
   sufficient sensitivity and specificity for depth-resolved visualization

Abstract = {{Catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) play an important role
   in fuel cells. Alternative non-precious metal catalysts with comparable
   ORR activity to Pt-based catalysts are highly desirable for the
   development of fuel cells. In this work, we report for the first time a
   spinel MnCo2O4/C ORR catalyst consisting of uniform MnCo2O4
   nanoparticles cross-linked with two-dimensional (2D) porous carbon
   nanosheets (abbreviated as porous MnCo2O4/C nanosheets), in which
   glucose is used as the carbon source and NaCl as the template. The
   obtained porous MnCo2O4/C nanosheets present the combined properties of
   an interconnected porous architecture and a large surface area (175.3
   m(2).g(-1)), as well as good electrical conductivity (1.15 x 10(2)
   S.cm(-1)). Thus, the as-prepared MnCo2O4/C nanosheets efficiently
   facilitate electrolyte diffusion and offer an expedite transport path
   for reactants and electrons during the ORR. As a result, the as-prepared
   porous MnCo2O4/C nanosheet catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity with
   a higher onset potential and current density than those of its
   counterparts, including pure MnCo2O4, carbon nanosheets, and Vulcan
   XC-72R carbon. More importantly, the porous MnCo2O4/C nanosheets exhibit
   a comparable electrocatalytic activity but superior stability and
   tolerance toward methanol crossover effects than a high-performance Pt/C
   catalyst in alkaline medium. The synthetic strategy outlined here can be
   extended to other nonprecious metal catalysts for application in
   electrochemical energy conversion.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Thromboembolic event (TE) risk stratification is performed by
   using CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score. It has been suggested that left atrial
   appendage (LAA) morphology independently influences TE risk in patients
   with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. LAA morphology has been classified
   into 4 types: chicken wing, cauliflower, windsock, and cactus.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine TE risk for each
   LAA morphology in patients with atrial fibrillation with low to
   intermediate TE risk.
   METHODS A systematic review of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase for
   studies that used computed tomography, tridimensional transesophageal
   echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to categorize
   the LAA morphologies with assessment of TE prevalence. Odds ratio (OR)
   and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were measured using the
   Mantel-Haenszel method. The fixed effects model was used, and if
   heterogeneity (I2) was >25\%, effects were analyzed using a random
   model.
   RESULTS Eight studies with 2596 patients were included. Eighty-four
   percent (n=1872) of patients had a CHADS2 score of <2. TE risk was lower
   in chicken wing morphology than in non-chicken wing morphology (OR 0.46;
   95\% CI 0.36-0.58). Likewise, chicken wing morphology had lower TE risk
   than did other morphologies (chicken wing vs cauliflower: OR 0.38; 950/0
   CI 0.26-0.56; chicken wing vs windsock: OR 0.48; 95\% CI 0.31-0.73;
   chicken wing vs cactus: OR 0.49; 95\% CI 0.36-0.66).
   CONCLUSION Patients with chicken wing LAA morphology are less likely to
   develop TE than patients with non-chicken wing morphology. LAA
   morphology may be a valuable criterion in predicting TE and could affect
   the stratification and anticoagulation management of patients with low
   to intermediate TE risk.}},

Title = {{Snap Transitions of Pressurized Graphene Blisters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Blister tests are commonly used to determine the mechanical and
   interfacial properties of thin film materials with recent applications
   for graphene. This paper presents a numerical study on snap transitions
   of pressurized graphene blisters. A continuum model is adopted combining
   a nonlinear plate theory for monolayer graphene with a nonlinear
   traction-separation relation for van der Waals interactions. Three types
   of blister configurations are considered. For graphene bubble blisters,
   snap-through and snap-back transitions between pancake-like and
   dome-like shapes are predicted under pressure-controlled conditions. For
   center-island graphene blisters, snap transitions between donut-like and
   dome-like shapes are predicted under both pressure and volume control.
   Finally, for the center-hole graphene blisters, growth is stable under
   volume or N-control but unstable under pressure control. With a finite
   hole depth, the growth may start with a snap transition under N-control
   if the hole is relatively deep. The numerical results provide a
   systematic understanding on the mechanics of graphene blisters,
   consistent with previously reported experiments. Of particular interest
   is the relationship between the van der Waals interactions and
   measurable quantities in corresponding blister tests, with which both
   the adhesion energy of graphene and the equilibrium separation for the
   van der Waals interactions may be determined. In comparison with
   approximate solutions based on membrane analyses, the numerical method
   offers more accurate solutions that may be used in conjunction with
   experiments for quantitative characterization of the interfacial
   properties of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) membrane
   materials.}},

   It is shown that the smoothness of geometric parametrizations central to

   approximation and numerical integration schemes. The regularization is
   applicable to both singular and hyper-singular integral equations, and

Title = {{Rider perception of a ``light{''} Bus Rapid Transit system - The New
   York City Select Bus Service}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{41-55}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in New York City (NYC), called Select
   Bus Service (SBS), is a ``light{''} BRT system with some but not all BRT
   features. Focusing on it, this study aims to contribute to a better
   understanding of riders' perceptions of BRT service implemented with
   limited space and capital funding. A total of 1700 SBS riders on four
   routes were interviewed using the survey methodology developed in this
   study. Statistical analysis and regression modeling were used to analyze
   rider socio-demographics, investigate the relationship between rider
   satisfaction levels, and the key factors driving them. The results show
   that, while most of them are transit dependent, new SBS riders are
   mainly attracted by better service and accessibility. Riders on
   different routes were found to have different socio-demographics. The
   statistical tests of satisfaction means provide further insight into the
   disparity in service evaluation between/among groups of riders (e.g.
   gender, experience, weather, route, trip purpose). Service frequency,
   speed, and on-time performance were found to have a positive influence
   on rider satisfaction across all routes. Variables related to off-board
   ticket machines and travel information are more valued than others. The
   effects of external factors vary according to characteristics of the
   routes and rider groups. This study suggests potential applications of
   the results for future planning and improvement to increase rider
   satisfaction and thereby retain and increase ridership. (C) 2016

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{34-40}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Of the total electricity-generating capacity in the United States, 20\%
   is dedicated to meet peak loads. Strategies to mitigate volatility in
   energy consumption have the potential to reduce the need for this
   surplus capacity. Here we investigate the potential for residential
   consumers to lower community-level peak demand through home energy
   management systems. We focus on the combination of air-conditioning use
   with the operation of time-shiftable appliances in the southern U.S. A
   centralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme minimizes peak
   air-conditioning (A/C) energy use by altering the thermostat set points
   in individual homes. We simultaneously schedule the operation of
   time-shiftable appliances to further reduce the community peak load. The
   scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program
   (MILP) aimed at minimizing peak load under constraints that reflect the
   start times and allowed delays of individual appliances (e.g.
   dishwashers, washing machines, dryers) in each house. Using sample data
   collected from residential homes and consumer survey data located in
   Austin, TX, USA we show that the proposed integrated control and
   scheduling approach can minimize the peak load for the neighborhood by
   leveraging the physical differences and individual preferences between
   houses. On average, our framework is able to reduce the daily peak load
   for the group of houses by 25.5\% (18.2 kW) when compared with the load
   for individually controlled thermostat settings and appliance start
   times. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The effects of water content and compression level on tissue thermal
   conductivity were studied. These effects are important in
   electrosurgery, as tissue is subjected to both compression and thermal
   heating. Ex vivo canine spleen tissue was used in this study. A thermal
   diffusion probe technique was employed to measure the tissue thermal
   conductivity in three different conditions. First, the tissue thermal
   conductivity with different water content levels was measured. The
   measured thermal conductivity decreased as the percentage of water
   within the tissue decreased. Second, the tissue thermal conductivity
   under compression, up to 77\%, was measured and it showed a 9\%
   reduction as the load was applied. Third, desiccated tissue was
   compressed, and the thermal conductivity was measured. The compression
   effect on thermal conductivity was less prominent in the desiccated
   tissue because less water was squeezed out due to compression. A
   three-phase Maxwell-Eucken model was developed to predict the tissue
   thermal conductivity for varying water content and compression levels.
   The model used the ratio of air, tissue fiber, and water to predict the
   thermal conductivity and showed a good agreement with the experimental
   data.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a simple model of two-phase gas-liquid flow by imposing a
   quasi-equilibrium on the mixture momentum balance of the classical
   transient drift-flux model. This reduces the model to a single
   hyperbolic PDE, describing the void wave, coupled with two static
   relations giving the void wave velocity from the now static momentum
   balance. Exploiting this, the new model uses a single distributed state,
   the void fraction, and with a suggested approximation of the two
   remaining static relations, all closure relations are given explicitly
   in, or as quadrature of functions of, the void fraction and exogenous
   variables. This makes model implementation, simulation and analysis very
   fast, simple and robust. Consequently, the proposed model is well-suited
   for model-based control and estimation applications concerning two-phase
   gas-liquid flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mg-doped composite, Li2.97Mg0.03VO4, with an orthorhombic structure was
   prepared by a sol-gel method. The effects of the Mg doping on the
   structure and electrochemical performance of Li3VO4 were investigated.
   The X-ray diffraction pattern shows that the Mg doping does not change
   the crystal structure of Li3VO4. The EDS mappings indicated the fairly
   uniform distribution of Mg throughout the grains of Li2.97Mg0.03VO4.
   Electronic conductivity of Mg-doped Li3VO4 increased by two orders of
   magnitude compared to that of pure Li3VO4. CV and EIS measurement
   confirms that the Li2.97Mg0.03VO4 sample exhibits a smaller polarization
   and transfer resistance and a higher lithium diffusion coefficient
   compared with the pure Li3VO4. Due to the better electrochemical
   kinetics properties, Mg-doped Li3VO4 showed a significant improved
   performance compared to the pure Li3VO4, especially for the high rate
   capability. At the higher discharge/charge rate (2C), the discharge and
   charge capacities of 415.5 and 406.1 mAh/g have been obtained for the
   Li2.97Mg0.03VO4 which is more than three times higher the
   discharge/charge capacities of Li3VO4. The discharge and charge
   capacities of pure Li3VO4 are only 126.4 and 125.8 mAh/g respectively.
   The excellent electrochemical performance of Li2.97Mg0.03VO4 enables it
   as a promising anode material for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.

Title = {{The Delta Phi Method of Evaluating Overall Film Cooling Performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Film cooling designs are often evaluated experimentally and
   characterized in terms of their spatial distributions of adiabatic
   effectiveness, eta, which is the nondimensionalized form of the
   adiabatic wall temperature, T-aw. Additionally, film cooling may alter
   the convective heat transfer coefficient with the possibility of an
   increase in h that offsets the benefits of reduced T-aw. It is therefore
   necessary to combine these two effects to give some measure of the
   benefit of film cooling. The most frequently used method is the net heat
   flux reduction (NHFR), which gives the fractional reduction in heat flux
   that accompanies film cooling for the hypothetical case of constant wall
   temperature. NHFR is imperfect in part due to the fact that this
   assumption does not account for the primary purpose of film cooling-to
   reduce the metal temperature to an acceptable level. In the present
   work, we present an alternative method of evaluating film cooling
   performance that yields the reduction in metal temperature, or in the
   nondimensional sense, an increase in phi that would be predicted with
   film cooling. This Delta phi approach is then applied using
   experimentally obtained eta and h/h(0) values on a simulated turbine
   blade leading edge region. The delta-phi approach agrees well with the
   legacy NHFR technique in terms of the binary question of whether the
   film cooling is beneficial or detrimental, but provides greater insight
   into the temperature reduction that a film cooling design would provide
   an actual turbine component. For example, instead of giving an
   area-averaged NHFR = 0.67 (indicating a 67\% reduction in heat flux
   through film cooling) on the leading edge region with M = 0.5, the Delta
   phi approach indicates an increase in phi of 0.061 (or a 61 K surface
   temperature decrease with a notional value of T-infinity - T-c = 1000
   K). Alternatively, the technique may be applied to predict the maximum
   allowable increase in T-infinity against which a film cooling scheme
   could protect.}},

Title = {{Glypican-1 nanoliposomes for potentiating growth factor activity in
   therapeutic angiogenesis}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{45-56}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Therapeutic angiogenesis is a highly appealing concept for treating
   tissues that become ischemic due to vascular disease. A major barrier to
   the clinical translation of angiogenic therapies is that the patients
   that are in the greatest need of these treatments often have long term
   disease states and co-morbidities, such as diabetes and obesity, that
   make them resistant to angiogenic stimuli. In this study, we identified
   that human patients with type 2 diabetes have reduced levels of
   glypican-1 in the blood vessels of their skin. The lack of this key
   co-receptor in the tissue may make the application of exogenous
   angiogenic growth factors or cell therapies ineffective. We created a
   novel therapeutic enhancer for growth factor activity consisting of
   glypican-1 delivered in a nanoliposomal carrier (a ``glypisome{''}).
   Here, we demonstrate that glypisomes enhance FGF-2 mediated endothelial
   cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. In addition,
   glypisomes enhance FGF-2 trafficking by increasing both uptake and
   endosomal processing. We encapsulated FGF-2 or FGF-2 with glypisomes in
   alginate beads and used these to deliver localized growth factor therapy
   in a murine hind limb ischemia model. Co-delivery of glypisomes with
   FGF-2 markedly increased the recovery of perfusion and vessel formation
   in ischemic hind limbs of wild type and diabetic mice in comparison to
   mice treated with FGF-2 alone. Together, our findings support that
   glypisomes are effective means for enhancing growth factor activity and
   may improve the response to local angiogenic growth factor therapies for
   ischemia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MICROVASCULAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},

Abstract = {{Cryotherapy is a therapeutic technique using ice or cold water applied
   to the skin to reduce bleeding, inflammation, pain, and swelling
   following soft tissue trauma and injury. While beneficial, there are
   some side effects such as pronounced vasoconstriction and tissue
   ischemia that are sustained for hours post-treatment. This study tested
   the hypothesis that this vasoconstriction is mediated by 1) the
   Rho-kinase pathway and/or 2) elevated oxidative stress. 9 subjects were
   fitted with a commercially available cryotherapy unit with a water
   perfused bladder on the lateral portion of the right calf. Participants
   were instrumented with three microdialysis probes underneath the
   bladder. One site received lactated ringers (control site), one received
   the Rho-Kinase inhibitor Fasudil, and one received Ascorbic Acid. Skin
   temperature (Tskin) and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was
   measured at each site. Subjects had 1 degrees C water perfused through
   the bladder for 30 min, followed by passive rewarming for 90 min. Tskin
   fell from similar to 34 degrees C to similar to 18.0 degrees C during
   active cooling across all sites and this response was similar for all
   sites (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). During passive rewarming Tskin
   rose to a similar degree in all sites (P > 0.05 relative to the end of
   cooling). \%CVC was reduced during active cooling in all sites; however,
   the magnitude of this response was blunted in the Fasudil site relative
   to control (P < 0.001 for all comparisons) and min 25 and 30 of cooling
   in the Ascorbic Acid site (P < 0.05). During passive rewarming \%CVC at
   the control and Ascorbic Acid sites did not change such that values were
   similar to the end of cooling (P > 0.05 for each comparison). \%CVC at
   the Fasudil site remained elevated during passive rewarming such that
   values were higher compared to the control and Ascorbic Acid sites
   throughout the 90 min of passive rewarming (P < 0.001 main effect of
   Fasudil). These findings indicate that the Rho-kinase pathway
   contributes to pronounced vasoconstriction during cryotherapy as well as
   the sustained vasoconstriction during the subsequent rewarming period
   post treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A tunable delivery platform to provide local chemotherapy for pancreatic
   ductal adenocarcinoma}},

Abstract = {{Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most devastating
   and painful cancers. It is often highly resistant to therapy owing to
   inherent chemoresistance and the desmoplastic response that creates a
   barrier of fibrous tissue preventing transport of chemotherapeutics into
   the tumor. The growth of the tumor in pancreatic cancer often leads to
   invasion of other organs and partial or complete biliary obstruction,
   inducing intense pain for patients and necessitating tumor resection or
   repeated stenting. Here, we have developed a delivery device to provide
   enhanced palliative therapy for pancreatic cancer patients by providing
   high concentrations of chemotherapeutic compounds locally at the tumor
   site. This treatment could reduce the need for repeated procedures in
   advanced PDAC patients to debulk the tumor mass or stent the obstructed
   bile duct. To facilitate clinical translation, we created the device out
   of currently approved materials and drugs. We engineered an implantable
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic)-based biodegradable device that is able to
   linearly release high doses of chemotherapeutic drugs for up to 60 days.
   We created five patient-derived PDAC cell lines and tested their
   sensitivity to approved chemotherapeutic compounds. These in vitro
   experiments showed that paclitaxel was the most effective single agent
   across all cell lines. We compared the efficacy of systemic and local
   paclitaxel therapy on the patient-derived cell lines in an orthotopic
   xenograft model in mice (PDX). In this model, we found up to a 12-fold
   increase in suppression of tumor growth by local therapy in comparison
   to systemic administration and reduce retention into off-target organs.
   Herein, we highlight the efficacy of a local therapeutic approach to
   overcome PDAC chemoresistance and reduce the need for repeated
   interventions and biliary obstruction by preventing local tumor growth.
   Our results underscore the urgent need for an implantable drug-eluting
   platform to deliver cytotoxic agents directly within the tumor mass as a
   novel therapeutic strategy for patients with pancreatic cancer. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We extend the reduced basis (RB) accelerated Bayesian inversion methods
   for affine-parametric, linear operator equations which are considered in
   {[}16,17] to non-affine, nonlinear parametric operator equations. We
   generalize the analysis of sparsity of parametric forward solution maps
   in {[}20] and of Bayesian inversion in {[}48,49] to the fully discrete
   setting, including Petrov-Galerkin high-fidelity ({''}HiFi{''})
   discretization of the forward maps. We develop adaptive, stochastic
   collocation based reduction methods for the efficient computation of
   reduced bases on the parametric solution manifold. The nonaffinity and
   nonlinearity with respect to (w.r.t.) the distributed, uncertain
   parameters and the unknown solution is collocated; specifically, by the
   so-called Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM). For the corresponding
   Bayesian inversion problems, computational efficiency is enhanced in two
   ways: first, expectations w.r.t. the posterior are computed by adaptive
   quadratures with dimension-independent convergence rates proposed in
   {[}49]; the present work generalizes {[}49] to account for the impact of
   the PG discretization in the forward maps on the convergence rates of
   the Quantities of Interest (QoI for short). Second, we propose to
   perform the Bayesian estimation only w.r.t. a parsimonious, RB
   approximation of the posterior density. Based on the approximation
   results in {[}49], the infinite-dimensional parametric, deterministic
   forward map and operator admit N-term RB and EIM approximations which
   converge at rates which depend only on the sparsity of the parametric
   forward map. In several numerical experiments, the proposed algorithms
   exhibit dimension-independent convergence rates which equal, at least,
   the currently known rate estimates for N-term approximation. We propose
   to accelerate Bayesian estimation by first offline construction of
   reduced basis surrogates of the Bayesian posterior density. The
   parsimonious surrogates can then be employed for online data
   assimilation and for Bayesian estimation. They also open a perspective
   for optimal experimental design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{63-72}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Although a variety of fundamental mechanical properties of graphene have
   been investigated, the nature of interactions between graphene and other
   materials is not yet fully understood. Here, we report on adhesive
   interactions between diamond indenters and monolayer, bilayer and
   trilayer graphene on silicon oxide as well as bare silicon oxide and
   graphite over relatively small spatial domains. Displacement-controlled
   nanoindentation with an ultralow noise force sensor allowed the complete
   adhesive responses to be observed without the usual instabilities
   associated with nanoindenters that operate in force control. It was
   found that the approach and withdrawal force profiles between diamond
   and graphene depended on the number of layers of graphene. The unloading
   response contained very characteristic features, which were attributed
   to separation between graphene and silicon oxide in subsequent stress
   analyses of the experiments. The numerical stress analyses accounted for
   the interactions between the probe and the graphene as well as between
   graphene and silicon oxide via traction-separation relations which
   included attractive and repulsive interactions. As a result, it was
   possible to extract the energy, strength and range of the interactions
   for all cases, thereby providing a much richer measure of the
   interactions than relying solely on force profiles. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Lithium-rich, Mn-based composites, such as
   Li(Li0.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O-2, retain immense interest for researchers
   and practitioners as one of the most promising candidates for electric
   vehicle applications (EV/HEV/PHEV). Enabling the commercialization of
   this battery system requires reducing intrinsic drawbacks, that is,
   large capacity fading during first cycle or low-rate capability; it is
   of great importance to optimize the composite design of the battery
   cathode. Information about the electronic structure and atomic
   environment of the transition metals (Mn, Co, and Ni) provides crucial
   insight into the structure of high-energy density cathodes. In this
   study, we present precise characterization of the atomic environments of
   each transition metal by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy using
   continuous Cauchy wavelet transform (CCWT) analysis during the first
   electrochemical cycle at the charge rate of 0.5 C. The CCWT
   interpretation provides continuous decomposition of extended X-ray
   absorption fine structure amplitudes and provides new insight into the
   local environment change during charging, which allows the ``atomic
   phase reversibility{''} to be identified by this novel approach.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal assembly is one of the highly active areas in nanoscale
   science and technology as it plays an important role in organizing
   nanoscale building blocks into hierarchical and functional systems for

   increasing trend in conductivity. We propose a ``layer-dependent

   points and possible defects, and the simulated trend of conductivity
   exhibits a corresponding match with experimental measurements. Our study
   serves as an important extension of colloidal assembly in 2D

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to present a simplified method to
   determine the pile foundation system capacity based on the lower bound
   theorem of plasticity. The motivations for determining the lower bound
   capacity are the following: (1) to evaluate the accuracy of solutions
   based on the upper bound method; (2) to provide a conservative and
   efficient solution to the system capacity; and (3) to provide
   information about load distribution among individual piles at the verge
   of failure for the pile system. The failure mechanisms for a single pile
   and for the pile system are assumed to be two-dimensional. For a typical
   long offshore pile, the upper and lower bound analyses produce identical
   lateral capacities. A simplified failure surface for loads at the single
   pile head is proposed and verified through analysis of 16 case study
   piles. With this proposed failure surface for a single pile, the lower
   bound failure load of the pile foundation system is obtained using the
   elastic compensation method enhanced with the linear matching method.
   Comparing with the existing upper bound and finite element solutions,
   the proposed lower bound method is capable of accurately and efficiently
   predicting the ultimate capacity of a pile foundation system. Copyright

Abstract = {{Heart failure remains a major public health concern with a 5-year
   mortality rate higher than that of most cancers. Myocardial disease in
   heart failure is frequently accompanied by impairment of the specialized
   electrical conduction system and myocardium. We introduce an epicardial
   mesh made of electrically conductive and mechanically elastic material,
   to resemble the innate cardiac tissue and confer cardiac conduction
   system function, to enable electromechanical cardioplasty. Our
   epicardium-like substrate mechanically integrated with the heart and
   acted as a structural element of cardiac chambers. The epicardial device
   was designed with elastic properties nearly identical to the epicardial
   tissue itself and was able to detect electrical signals reliably on the
   moving rat heart without impeding diastolic function 8 weeks after
   induced myocardial infarction. Synchronized electrical stimulation over
   the ventricles by the epicardial mesh with the high conductivity of
   11,210 S/cm shortened total ventricular activation time, reduced
   inherent wall stress, and improved several measures of systolic function
   including increases of 51\% in fractional shortening, similar to 90\% in
   radial strain, and 42\% in contractility. The epicardial mesh was also
   capable of delivering an electrical shock to terminate a ventricular
   tachyarrhythmia in rodents. Electromechanical cardioplasty using an
   epicardial mesh is a new pathway toward reconstruction of the cardiac
   tissue and its specialized functions.}},

Abstract = {{Activated carbon fibers (ACFs) with different pore structure have been
   prepared from wood sawdust using the KOH activation method. A study was
   conducted to examine the influence of the activation parameters
   (temperature, alkali/carbon ratio, and time) on the morphology and
   structure of the as-prepared ACFs developed in the process of pore
   generation and evolution. Activation temperature was very essential for
   the formation of utramicropores (<0.6 nm), which greatly contributed to
   the electric double layer capacitance. The significance of metallic
   potassium vapor evolved when the temperature was above 800 degrees C,
   since the generation of 0.8- and 1.1 nm micropores cannot be ignored.
   When the the KOH/fiber ratio was increased and the activation time was
   prolonged, to some extent, the micropores were enlarged to small
   mesopores within 2-5 nm. The sample with the optimal condition exhibited
   the highest specific capacitance (225 F g(-1) at a current density of
   0.5 A g(-1)). Its ability to retain capacitance corresponding to 10 A
   g(-1) and 6 M KOH was 85.3\%, demonstrating a good rate capability. With
   10 000 charge-discharge cycles at 3 A g(-1), the supercapacitor kept
   94.2\% capacity, showing outstanding electrochemical performance as
   promising electrode material.}},

Title = {{Quantitative scanning thermal microscopy of graphene devices on flexible
   polyimide substrates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{A triple-scan scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) method and a zero-heat
   flux laser-heated SThM technique are investigated for quantitative
   thermal imaging of flexible graphene devices. A similar local tip-sample
   thermal resistance is observed on both the graphene and metal areas of
   the sample, and is attributed to the presence of a polymer residue layer
   on the sample surface and a liquid meniscus at the tip-sample junction.
   In addition, it is found that the tip-sample thermal resistance is
   insensitive to the temperature until it begins to increase as the
   temperature increases to 80 degrees C and exhibits an abrupt increase at
   110 degrees C because of evaporation of the liquid meniscus at the
   tip-sample junction. Moreover, the variation in the tip-sample thermal
   resistance due to surface roughness is within the experimental tolerance
   except at areas with roughness height exceeding tens of nanometers.
   Because of the low thermal conductivity of the flexible polyimide
   substrate, the SThM measurements have found that the temperature rise in
   flexible graphene devices is more than one order of magnitude higher
   than those reported for graphene devices fabricated on a silicon
   substrate with comparable dimensions and power density. Unlike a
   graphene device on a silicon substrate where the majority of the
   electrical heating in the graphene device is conducted vertically
   through the thin silicon dioxide dielectric layer to the high-thermal
   conductivity silicon substrate, lateral heat spreading is important in
   the flexible graphene devices, as shown by the observed decrease in the
   average temperature rise normalized by the power density with decreasing
   graphene channel length from about 30 mu m to 10 mu m. However, it is
   shown by numerical heat transfer analysis that this trend is mainly
   caused by the size scaling of the thermal spreading resistance of the
   polymer substrate instead of lateral heat spreading by the graphene. In
   addition, thermoelectric effects are found to be negligible compared to
   Joule heating in the flexible graphene devices measured in this work.

Pages = {{6146-6153}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{In adoption decisions for decentralized sanitation technologies, two
   decision makers are involved: the public utility and the individual
   homeowner. Standard life cycle cost is calculated from the perspective
   of the utility, which uses a market-based discount rate in these
   calculations. However, both decision-makers must be considered,
   including their differing perceptions of the time trade-offs inherent in
   a stream of costs and benefits. This study uses the discount rate as a
   proxy for these perceptions and decision-maker preferences. The results
   in two case studies emphasize the dependence on location of such
   analyses. Falmouth, Massachusetts, appears to be a good candidate for
   incentivizing decentralized sanitation while the Allegheny County
   Sanitary Authority service area in Pennsylvania appears to have no need
   for similar incentives. This method can be applied to any two-party
   decision in which the parties are expected to have different discount
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Chloramines are the second most used secondary disinfectant by United
   States water utilities. However, chloramination may promote nitrifying
   bacteria. Recently, monochloramine cometabolisin by the pure culture
   ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, Nitrosomonas europaea, was shown to increase
   monochloramine demand. The current research investigated monochloramine
   cometabolism by nitrifying mixed cultures grown under more relevant
   drinking water conditions and harvested from sand-packed reactors before
   conducting suspended growth batch kinetic experiments. Four types of
   batch kinetic experiments were conducted: (1) positive controls to
   estimate ammonia kinetic parameters, (2) negative controls to account
   for biomass reactivity, (3) utilization associated product (UAP)
   controls to account for UAP reactivity, and (4) cometabolism experiments
   to estimate cometabolism kinetic parameters. Kinetic parameters were
   estimated in AQUASIM with a simultaneous fit to the experimental data.
   Cometabolism kinetics were best described by a first-order model.
   Monochloramine cometabolism kinetics were similar to those of ammonia
   metabolism, and monochloramine cometabolism accounted for 30\% of the
   observed monochloramine loss. These results demonstrated that
   monochloramine cometabolism occurred in mixed cultures similar to those
   found in drinking water distribution systems; therefore, monochloramine
   cometabolism may be a significant contribution to monochloramine loss
   during nitrification episodes in drinking water distribution systems.}},

Abstract = {{We use ab initio coupled-cluster theory to compute the spectral function
   of the uniform electron gas at a Wigner-Seitz radius of r(s) = 4. The
   coupled-cluster approximations we employ go significantly beyond the

   calculations extensively to GW and GW-plus-cumulant theory, illustrating
   the strengths and weaknesses of these methods in capturing the
   quasiparticle and satellite features of the electron gas. Our accurate
   calculations further allow us to address the long-standing debate over
   the occupied bandwidth of metallic sodium. Our findings indicate that
   the future application of coupled-cluster theory to condensed phase
   material spectra is highly promising.}},

Abstract = {{The TOL plasmid promoters are activated by toluene leading to gene
   expression responsible for the degradation of the environmental signal.
   Benzoate is formed as an intermediate, activating the BenR protein of
   the chromosomal ortho-cleavage pathway that up-regulates the chromosomal
   PbenA promoter and the TOL Pm promoter resulting in cross-talk between
   the two networks. Herein, the transcriptional kinetics of the PbenR and
   PbenA promoters in conjunction with TOL promoters was monitored by
   real-time PCR during toluene biodegradation of different concentrations
   in batch cultures. The cross-talk between the two pathways was indicated
   by the simultaneous maximal expression of the Pm and PbenR promoters, as
   well as the transcriptional activation from PbenA occurring prior to
   PbenR, which indicates the potential up-regulation of PbenA by the TOL
   XylS protein. The repressory effect of toluene on Pr was evident for
   concentrations higher than 0.3 mM suggesting a threshold value for
   restoring the promoter's activity, while all the other promoters
   followed a specific expression pattern, regardless of the initial
   inducer concentration. Induction of the system with higher toluene
   concentrations revealed an oscillatory behaviour of Pm, the expression
   of which remained at high levels until the late exponential phase,
   demonstrating a novel function of this network. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Information processing in the presence of noise has been a key challenge
   in multiple disciplines including computer science, communications, and
   neuroscience. Among such noise-reduction mechanisms, the shift-map code
   represents an analog variable by its residues with respect to distinct
   moduli (that are chosen as geometric scalings of an integer). Motivated
   by the multi-periodic neural code in the entorhinal cortex, i.e., the
   coding mechanism of grid cells, this work extends the shift-map code by
   generalizing the choices of moduli. In particular, it is shown that
   using similarly sized moduli (for instance, evenly and closely spaced
   integers, which tend to have large co-prime factors) results in a code
   whose codewords are separated in an interleaving way such that when the
   decoder has side information regarding the source, then error control is
   significantly improved (compared to the original shift map code). This
   novel structure allows the system to dynamically adapt to the side
   information at the decoder, even if the encoder is not privy to the side
   information. A geometrical interpretation of the proposed coding scheme
   and a method to find such codes are detailed. As an extension, it is
   shown that this novel code also adapts to scenarios when only a fraction
   of codeword symbols is available at the decoder. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{It is well-known that the transport properties of monolayer graphene are
   degraded by charged impurities present between graphene and either a
   given substrate or air. Such impurities cause charge scattering of holes
   and electrons in graphene. In previous work, our group has used both
   fluoropolymer thin films and polar vapor molecules to dramatically
   improve graphene field-effect transistor (FET) device characteristics,
   including Dirac voltage and mobility. We attributed the graphene device
   improvements to mitigation of charged impurities and defects due to
   electrostatic interaction with the dipoles of the applied fluoropolymers
   and polar molecules. In this work, we present theoretical support to
   this hypothesis, in the form of computational chemical simulations
   involving the interaction of polar molecules and impurities on a
   graphene sheet. We examine two types of impurities which may occur at
   graphene interfaces: ionic impurities and molecular dipole impurities.
   Upon introduction of polar vapor molecules to an impurity/graphene
   system, we observed a dramatic reduction in the electrostatic potential
   in the plane of the graphene from the impurity. The magnitude of
   potential reduction scales with the average dipole moment of each polar
   molecule. We were able to determine two separate mechanisms which
   contribute to the total potential reduction, impurity displacement, and
   electrostatic screening of the impurity. The respective impacts of the
   mechanisms vary with distance from the impurity. Additionally, in the
   case of the molecular dipole impurity, the orientation of the impurity
   atop graphene is a key factor that determines the potential impact.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, two Benders decomposition algorithms and a novel
   two-stage integer programming-based heuristic are presented to optimize
   the beam angle and fluence map in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy
   (IMRT) planning. Benders decomposition is first implemented in the
   traditional manner by iteratively solving the restricted master problem
   and then identifying and adding the violated Benders cuts. We also
   implemented Benders decomposition using the ``lazy constraint{''}
   feature included in CPLEX. In contrast, the two-stage heuristic first
   seeks to find a good solution by iteratively eliminating the least used
   angles in the linear programming relaxation solution until the size of
   the formulation is manageable. In the second stage of the heuristic, the
   solution is improved by applying local branching. The various methods
   were tested on real patient data to evaluate their effectiveness and
   runtime characteristics. The results indicated that implementing Benders
   using the lazy constraint usually led to better feasible solutions than
   the traditional approach. Moreover, the LP rounding heuristic was seen
   to generate high-quality solutions within a short amount of time, with
   further improvement obtained with the local branching search. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Inherited retinal dystrophies are a group of genetically heterogeneous
   conditions with broad phenotypic heterogeneity. We analyzed a large
   five-generation pedigree with early-onset recessive retinal degeneration
   to identify the causative mutation. Linkage analysis and homozygosity
   mapping combined with exome sequencing were carried out to map the
   disease locus and identify the p.G178R mutation in the asparaginase
   like-1 gene (ASRGL1), segregating with the retinal dystrophy phenotype
   in the study pedigree. ASRGL1 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the
   hydrolysis of L-asparagine and isoaspartyl-peptides. Studies on the
   ASRGL1 expressed in Escherichia coli and transiently transfected
   mammalian cells indicated that the p.G178R mutation impairs the
   autocatalytic processing of this enzyme resulting in the loss of
   functional ASRGL1 and leaving the inactive precursor protein as a
   destabilized and aggregation-prone protein. A zebrafish model
   overexpressing the mutant hASRGL1 developed retinal abnormalities and
   loss of cone photoreceptors. Our studies suggest that the p.G178R
   mutation in ASRGL1 leads to photoreceptor degeneration resulting in
   progressive vision loss.}},

   product of V-pi x L = 0.282 V x mm measured at 100 KHz is achieved by
   slow-light enhancement, corresponding to an unprecedented record-high
   effective in-device EO coefficient (r(33)) of 1230 pm/V among
   silicon-organic hybrid modulators. Excluding the slow-light effect, the
   actual in-device r(33) is estimated to be 98 pm/V. By engineering the RC
   time constant via silicon doping and also utilizing a backside gate
   technique, the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of the device is measured to be
   15 GHz. In addition, the RF power consumption of the modulator is
   estimated to be 24 mW at 10 GHz, and the estimated energy consumption
   for potential digital modulations is approximately 94.4 fJ/bit at 10
   Gb/s.}},

Abstract = {{We propose to apply the multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO) from
   wireless communication to high density on-chip optical interconnect.
   MIMO makes it possible to reduce the waveguide pitch to subwavelength
   range and uses the crosstalk to improve system performance. The proposed
   NxN on-chip MIMO system consists of transmitter, high-density
   waveguides, homodyne coherent receivers, and electrical signal
   processing components. As an example, a 10 x 10 MIMO system with
   waveguide spacing of 250 nm is simulated. The possibility of data
   transmission at 10 Gb/s/channel fromhigh-densitywaveguide array is
   numerically investigated. The minimum input optical power for the BER of
   10(-12) can reach -18.1 dBm. The BER is better than 10(-12) when there
   is a phase shift of 73.5 degrees. Compared to the conventional parallel
   waveguides with 2-mu m pitch, the bandwidth density can be enhanced from
   5 to 13.33 Gbit/mu m/s at 10 Gb/s by using the MIMO techniques.}},

Abstract = {{We show that electromagnetic plane waves can be fully ``teleported{''}
   through thin, nearly fully reflective sheets, assisted by a pair of
   parity-time-symmetric lossy and active sheets in front and behind the
   screen. The proposed structure is able to almost perfectly absorb
   incident waves over a wide range of frequency and incidence angles,
   while waves having a specific frequency and incidence angle are
   replicated behind the structure in synchronization with the input
   signal. It is shown that the proposed structure can be designed to
   teleport waves at any desired frequency and incidence angle.
   Furthermore, we generalize the proposed concept to the case of
   teleportation of electromagnetic waves over electrically long distances,
   enabling full absorption at one surface and the synthesis of the same
   signal at another point located electrically far away from the first
   surface. The physical principle behind this selective teleportation is
   discussed, and similarities and differences with tunneling and cloaking
   concepts based on PT symmetry are investigated. From the application
   point of view, the proposed structure works as an extremely selective
   filter, both in frequency and spatial domains.}},

Abstract = {{For Gaussian sampling matrices, we provide bounds on the minimal number
   of measurements m required to achieve robust weighted sparse recovery
   guarantees in terms of how well a given prior model for the sparsity
   support aligns with the true underlying support. Our main contribution
   is that for a sparse vector x E RN supported on an unknown set S C \{1,
   . . , N\} with ISM < k, if S has weighted cardinality w(S) :=Sigma(j)is
   an element of sw(j)(2) and if the weights on Se exhibit mild growth,
   w(j)(2) > y log(j/w(S)) for j E SC and y > 0, then the sample complexity
   for sparse recovery via weighted 1-minimization using weights wj is
   linear in the weighted sparsity level, and m = O(w(S)/gamma). This main
   result is a generalization of special cases including a) the standard
   sparse recovery setting where all weights coj 1, and m = O(k log(N/k));
   b) the setting where the support is known a priori, and m = O(k); and c)
   the setting of sparse recovery with prior information, and m depends on
   how well the weights are aligned with the support set S. We further
   extend the results in case c) to the setting of additive noise. Our
   results are nonuniform that is they apply for a fixed support, unknown a
   priori, and the weights on S do not all have to be smaller than the
   weights on SC for our recovery results to hold.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents phase field fracture modeling in heterogeneous porous
   media. We develop robust and efficient numerical algorithms for
   pressure-driven and fluid-driven settings in which the focus relies on
   mesh adaptivity in order to save computational cost for large-scale 3D
   applications. In the fluid-driven framework, we solve for three unknowns
   pressure, displacements and phase field that are treated with a
   fixed-stress iteration in which the pressure and the
   displacement-phase-field system are decoupled. The latter subsystem is
   solved with a combined Newton approach employing a primal-dual active
   set method in order to account for crack irreversibility. Numerical
   examples for pressurized fractures and fluid filled fracture propagation
   in heterogeneous porous media demonstrate our developments. In
   particular, mesh refinement allows us to perform systematic studies with
   respect to the spatial discretization parameter. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A new discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is introduced that seamlessly
   merges exact geometry with high-order solution accuracy. This new method
   is called the blended isogeometric discontinuous Galerkin (BIDG) method.
   The BIDG method contrasts with existing high-order accurate DG methods
   over curvilinear meshes (e.g. classical isoparametric DG methods) in
   that the underlying geometry is exactly preserved at every mesh
   refinement level, allowing for intricate and complicated real-world mesh
   design to be streamlined and automated using computer-aided design (CAD)
   software. The BIDG method is designed specifically for easy
   incorporation into existing code architecture. This paper discusses
   specific details of implementation using two examples: (1) the acoustic
   wave equations, and (2) Maxwell's equations. Basic tests of accuracy and
   stability are demonstrated, including optimal convergence, and
   supplemental theoretical results are provided in the appendix along with
   links to fully operational working code examples. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{During production of concentrated monoclonal antibody formulations by
   tangential flow ultrafiltration (TFF), high viscosities and aggregation
   often cause extensive membrane fouling, flux decay and low product
   yields. To address these challenges, the co-solutes histidine or
   imidazole were added at high concentrations from 250 to 320 mM to reduce
   the viscosity by up to ten-fold relative to conventional low co-solute
   formulations, to as low as 40 cP at 250 mg/mL. At high mAb
   concentrations of up to 280 mg/mL, the transmembrane flux was increased
   threefold by adding high concentrations of co-solutes that also lowered
   the viscosity. Furthermore, the co-solutes also increased the mAb gel
   point concentration c(g) by up to 100 mg/mL mAb and thus enhanced
   concentration polarization-driven back-diffusion of the mAb at the
   membrane wall, which led to increased fluxes. The low viscosity and
   hollow fiber filter modules with straight flow paths enabled more
   uniform TMP and wall shear stress tau(w) profiles, which mitigated the
   reversible flux decay that results from an axial decline in the local
   TMP. The concentrated mAb was stable by SEC before and after extended
   storage at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Exploiting the chemical compatibility of transparent high surface area
   silica aerogels and environmentally benign luminescent silicon
   nanocrystals (SiNCs) opens the door to a new class of silicon based
   hybrid materials. Hydrophilic SiNCs of various sizes and surface groups
   that photoluminesce throughout the visible and NIR spectral regions were
   synthesized and incorporated into a tetramethyl orthosilicate containing
   solution to produce luminescent aerogels of varied transparency.
   Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy performed on solutions and aerogel
   monoliths containing SiNCs reveal that the optical properties of SiNCs
   are dependent on their size and surface chemistry. Furthermore, the
   incorporation of SiNCs into aerogels does not influence their PL
   response. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements indicate that
   the physical properties of aerogels may be tailored by changing the SiNC
   size and surface chemistry. Adding to the appeal of the present work, PL
   quenching of SiNC-loaded aerogel upon exposure to nitrobenzene confirms
   that SiNCs remain chemically accessible.}},

Title = {{The influence of wheelchair propulsion hand pattern on upper extremity
   muscle power and stress}},

Abstract = {{The hand pattern (i.e., full-cycle hand path) used during manual
   wheelchair propulsion is frequently classified as one of four distinct
   hand pattern types: arc, single loop, double loop or semicircular.
   Current clinical guidelines recommend the use of the semicircular
   pattern, which is based on advantageous levels of broad biomechanical
   metrics implicitly related to the demand placed on the upper extremity
   (e.g., lower cadence). However, an understanding of the influence of
   hand pattern on specific measures of upper extremity muscle demand
   (e.g., muscle power and stress) is needed to help make such
   recommendations, but these quantities are difficult and impractical to
   measure experimentally. The purpose of this study was to use
   musculoskeletal modeling and forward dynamics simulations to investigate
   the influence of the hand pattern used on specific measures of upper
   extremity muscle demand. The simulation results suggest that the double
   loop and semicircular patterns produce the most favorable levels of
   overall muscle stress and total muscle power. The double loop pattern
   had the lowest full-cycle and recovery-phase upper extremity demand but
   required high levels of muscle power during the relatively short contact
   phase. The semicircular pattern had the second-lowest full-cycle levels
   of overall muscle stress and total muscle power, and demand was more
   evenly distributed between the contact and recovery phases. These
   results suggest that in order to decrease upper extremity demand, manual
   wheelchair users should consider using either the double loop or
   semicircular pattern when propelling their wheelchairs at a
   self-selected speed on level ground. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study illustrates that amine functional groups on the ends of
   telechelic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) can undergo post-processing
   reactions with surface epoxy groups on graphene oxide (GO) to form a
   robust elastomer during simple heating. In these materials, GO acts both
   as a nanofiller which reinforces the mechanical properties and
   participates as a multifunctional crosslinker, thereby promoting elastic
   properties. Experiments indicate that the telechelic PDMS/GO elastomer
   is highly crosslinked (e.g., more than 75 wt \% is a non-dissolving
   crosslinked gel) but highly flexible such that it can be stretched up to
   300\% of its original length. Finally, the PDMS/GO elastomer was tested
   as a single gas barrier membrane and gas permeability was decreased
   similar to 45\% by incorporating 1 wt \% (0.43 vol \%) of GO, thereby
   highlighting its potential use in practical applications. (C) 2016

Title = {{Tunable scattering cancellation cloak with plasmonic ellipsoids in the
   visible}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{The scattering cancellation technique is a powerful tool to reduce the
   scattered field from electrically small objects in a specific frequency
   window. The technique relies on covering the object of interest with a
   shell that scatters light into a far field of equal strength as the
   object but with a phase shift of pi. The resulting destructive
   interference prohibits its detection in measurements that probe the
   scattered light. Whereas at radio or microwave frequencies feasible
   designs have been proposed that allow us to tune the operational
   frequency upon request, similar capabilities have not yet been explored
   in the visible. However, such an ability is necessary to capitalize on
   the technique in many envisioned applications. Here, we solve the
   problem and study the use of small metallic nanoparticles with an
   ellipsoidal shape as the material from which the shell is made to build
   an isotropic geometry. Changing the aspect ratio of the ellipsoids
   allows us to change the operational frequency. The basic functionality
   is explored with two complementary analytical approaches. Additionally,
   we present a powerful multiscattering algorithm that can be used to
   perform full-wave simulations of clusters of arbitrary particles. We
   utilize this method to analyze the scattering of the presented designs
   numerically. Herein we provide useful guidelines for the fabrication of
   this cloak with self-assembly methods by investigating the effects of
   disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of solar irradiation into chemical fuels such as hydrogen
   with the use of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell is an attractive
   strategy for green energy. The promising technique of incorporating
   metal nanoparticles (NPs) in the photoelectrodes is being explored to
   enhance the performance of the photoelectrodes. In this work, we
   developed Au-NPs-functionalized nanoporous BiVO4 photoanodes, and
   utilized the plasmonic effects of Au NPs to enhance the photoresponse.
   The plasmonic enhancement leads to an AM 1.5 photocurrent of 5.1 +/- 0.1
   mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus a reverse hydrogen electrode. We observed an
   enhancement of five times with respect to pristine BiVO4 in the
   photocurrent with long-term stability and high energy-conversion
   efficiency. The overall performance enhancement is attributed to the
   synergy between the nanoporous architecture of BiVO4 and the plasmonic
   effects of Au NPs. Our further study reveals that the commendable
   photoactivity arises from the different plasmonic effects and
   co-catalyst effects of Au NPs.}},

   goal configuration while avoiding collision with other agents,
   obstacles, and the boundary of the work area. The control scheme employs
   an avoidance strategy that ensures that the agents are never trapped at

   function-based approaches. A numerical simulation is presented to
   demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed control

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the portable electronics
   industry and solid-state electrochemical research and development for
   the past two decades. In light of possible concerns over the cost and
   future availability of lithium, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and other
   new technologies have emerged as candidates for large-scale stationary
   energy storage. Research in these technologies has increased
   dramatically with a focus on the development of new materials for both
   the positive and negative electrodes that can enhance the cycling
   stability, rate capability, and energy density. Two-dimensional (2D)
   materials are showing promise for many energy-related applications and
   particularly for energy storage, because of the efficient ion transport
   between the layers and the large surface areas available for improved
   ion adsorption and faster surface redox reactions. Recent research
   highlights on the use of 2D materials in these future
   `beyond-lithium-ion' battery systems are reviewed, and strategies to
   address challenges are discussed as well as their prospects.}},

Abstract = {{Alkoxy-terminated silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) were synthesized via
   hydrosilylation of aliphatic ketones on hydride-terminated SiQD (H-SiQD)
   surfaces under microwave-irradiation. Aromatic ketones undergo
   hydrosilylation on H-SiQD surfaces at room temperature without requiring
   any catalyst. The alkoxy-terminated SiQDs are soluble in organic
   solvents, colloidally stable, and show bright and size dependent
   photoluminescence (PL). The alkoxy-functionalized silicon surfaces were
   used as reactive platform for further functionalization via
   unprecedented ligand exchange of the alkoxy-surface groups with alkyl or
   alkenyl-surface groups in the presence of BH3 center dot THF. Proton
   nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR),
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectroscopy confirmed
   alkoxy-terminated surfaces and their ligand exchange reactions in the
   presence of various alkenes and alkynes.}},

   the bubbles considered in the cluster which is possible because the

Abstract = {{Rapid reduction of aqueous ClO4- to Cl- by H-2 has been realized by a
   heterogeneous Re(hoz)(2)-Pd/C catalyst integrating Re(O)(hoz)(2)Cl
   complex (hoz = oxazolinyl-phenolato bidentate ligand) and Pd
   nanoparticles on carbon support, but ClOx- intermediates formed during
   reactions with concentrated ClO4- promote irreversible Re complex
   decomposition and catalyst deactivation. The original catalyst design
   mimics the microbial ClO4- reductase, which integrates Mo(MGD)(2)
   complex (MGD = molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) for oxygen atom
   transfer (OAT). Perchlorate reducing microorganisms employ a separate
   enzyme, chlorite dismutase, to prevent accumulation of the destructive
   ClO2- intermediate. The structural intricacy of MGD ligand and the
   two-enzyme mechanism for microbial ClO4- reduction inspired us to
   improve catalyst stability by rationally tuning Re ligand structure and
   adding a ClOx- scavenger. Two new Re complexes, Re(O)(htz)(2)Cl and
   Re(O)(hoz)(htz)Cl (htz = thiazolinylphenolato bidentate ligand),
   significantly mitigate Re complex decomposition by slightly lowering the
   OAT activity when immobilized in Pd/C. Further stability enhancement is
   then obtained by switching the nanoparticles from Pd to Rh, which
   exhibits high reactivity with ClOx- intermediates and thus prevents
   their deactivating reaction with the Re complex. Compared to
   Re(hoz)(2)-Pd/C, the new Re(hoz)(htz)-Rh/C catalyst exhibits similar
   ClO4- reduction activity but superior stability, evidenced by a decrease
   of Re leaching from 37\% to 0.25\% and stability of surface Re
   speciation following the treatment of a concentrated ``challenge{''}
   solution containing 1000 ppm of ClO4-. This work, demonstrates the
   pivotal roles of coordination chemistry control and tuning of individual
   catalyst components for achieving both high activity and stability in
   environmental catalyst applications.}},

Title = {{Residential energy retrofits in a cooling climate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{112-118}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this analysis we calculate the effect of energy retrofits in almost
   500 homes in Austin, TX. We used measured daily energy use data (kW
   h/day) from before and after the homes received energy retrofits. These
   retrofits included attic insulation, new heating, ventilation, and
   air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, window screen/film, new windows, new
   ducts, and added duct insulation. We used a mixed effects regression
   model (with and without interaction terms) to identify the impact of
   each type of retrofit, as many homes received multiple measures. We used
   both utility rebates (to the homeowner) and total retrofit cost
   information to find the levelized avoided cost (\$/kW h) of energy
   consumption to both the rebate issuing entity (in this case, Austin
   Energy - the local municipally owned electric utility) and the
   homeowner. Results indicate that, at current rebate levels, all ``rebate
   costs{''} incurred by the utility are less than the average cost to
   procure energy on the wholesale market (\$0.035/kW h). Thus the utility
   could make a profit by forgoing energy sales to local residential
   customers and instead selling into the market. Regression results show
   that increasing attic insulation, replacing older heating, ventilation,
   and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, and replacing duct systems will
   most likely be cost effective for the homeowner at the current time,
   i.e. the costs are less than the current electricity rate (about
   \$0.11/kW h), but replacing windows might not. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   ruptured during the stamping process by shear stresses. Through
   analytical modeling, this paper reveals the membrane stress in the
   nanomembrane induced by stamp compression as a function of the stamp and
   nanomembrane property and geometry, as well as the traction-separation
   relation between the nanomembrane and the donor substrate. While
   membrane stress in the nanomembrane increases monotonically with the
   compressive loading applied on the stamp, an abrupt increase appears
   when nanomembrane-substrate interface starts to fail. While the stamp is
   assumed to be incompressible material in the main text, more general
   solutions for compressible stamps are offered in the supplementary
   material (see Appendix B). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Approximate computing trades off accuracy of results for resources such
   as energy or computing time. There is a large and rapidly growing
   literature on approximate computing that has focused mostly on showing
   the benefits of approximate computing. However, we know relatively
   little about how to control approximation in a disciplined way.
   In this paper, we address the problem of controlling approximation for
   non-streaming programs that have a set of ``knobs{''} that can be dialed
   up or down to control the level of approximation of different components
   in the program. We formulate this control problem as a constrained
   optimization problem, and describe a system called Capri that uses
   machine learning to learn cost and error models for the program, and
   uses these models to determine, for a desired level of approximation,
   knob settings that optimize metrics such as running time or energy
   usage. Experimental results with complex benchmarks from different
   problem domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete-element-method (DEM) simulations were shown to be useable for
   selecting screens with simple geometries (e.g., wire-wrap screens) under
   prepack test conditions (Mondal et al. 2011). Metal mesh screens (MMSs)
   (commonly referred to as premium screens) can have multiple (sometimes
   sintered) layers with different weave patterns. Any model for estimating
   sand production in such screens must account for these complexities. The
   objective of this paper is to explore different techniques to create
   accurate representations of complex filter media and to use them in
   numerical simulations and/or analytical models for improved screen
   selection.
   In this paper, we used computed-tomography (CT) images of real-screen
   coupons to construct 3D replicas of two MMS types: plain square mesh
   (PSM) and plain Dutch weave (PDW). An entirely computer-based method of
   creating 3D screen assemblies is also presented. These virtual screens
   were compared and validated against those generated from the CT images.
   We conducted DEM simulations of prepack tests through these multilayer
   MMS assemblies. The retention efficiency of MMSs for different particle
   sizes was also calculated for better slurry-test modeling. We
   quantitatively showed that the effective size of MMS assemblies can be
   significantly lower than the nominal rating of the filter layer.
   This paper augments the prepack-test and slurry-test models for
   mesh-type screens presented earlier (Mondal et al. 2012; Chanpura et al.
   2013). Determination of the retention efficiency of MMSs, which is
   currently characterized by a single filter-cut point, is also a step
   forward in quality assurance and quality control of these screens.
   Finally, we demonstrate that one can conduct in-depth screen design and
   optimization studies with virtual meshes in a consistent way and at a
   fraction of the cost and time that would be required otherwise by use of
   conventional experimental techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture-initiation pressure (FIP) and fracture-propagation pressure
   (FPP) are both important considerations for preventing and mitigating
   lost circulation. For significant fluid loss to occur, a fracture must
   initiate on an intact wellbore or reopen on a wellbore with pre-existing
   fractures, and then propagate into the far-field region.
   Wellbore-strengthening operations are designed to increase one or both
   of these two pressures to combat lost circulation. Currently, some
   theoretical models assume that FIPs and FPPs are only functions of
   in-situ stress and rock-mechanical properties. However, as demonstrated
   by numerous field and laboratory observations, they are also highly
   related to drilling-fluid properties and to interactions between the
   drilling fluid and formation rock.
   This paper discusses the mechanisms of lost circulation and wellbore
   strengthening, with an emphasis on factors that can affect FIP and FPP.
   These factors include microfractures on the wellbore wall,
   in-situ-stress anisotropy, pore pressure, fracture toughness,
   filter-cake development, fracture bridging/plugging, bridge location,
   fluid leakoff, rock permeability, pore size of rock, mud type, mud solid
   concentration, and critical capillary pressure. The conclusions of this
   paper include information seldom considered in lost-circulation studies,
   such as the effect of microfractures on FIP and the effect of capillary
   forces on FPP. Research results described in this paper may be useful
   for lost-circulation mitigation and wellbore-strengthening design, as
   well as hydraulic- fracturing design and leakoff-test (LOT)
   interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Low-salinity-water injection (LSWI) is an emerging way to improve
   waterflood performance at low cost under certain conditions. The effect
   of LSWI on the oil recovery from carbonate formations has been
   well-documented in the laboratory and to a limited extent in the field.
   In this study, a mechanistic geochemical model is proposed that
   addresses the effect on oil recovery of different geochemical reactions
   resulting from LSWI. The proposed model was used to history match
   recently published core-floods by use of the UTCHEM (2000) mechanistic
   reservoir simulator. Moreover, other sets of corefloods were chosen to
   validate the proposed LSWI mechanistic model. The geochemical model in
   the UTCHEM simulator was modified to calculate the molar Gibbs free
   energy of the brine. In the proposed LSWI mechanistic model, the
   relative permeability curves, including the residual oil saturation
   (ROS), are functions of the molar Gibbs free energy. Coreflood
   experiments were simulated and history matched by use of the proposed
   model. The proposed LSWI mechanistic model was further extended to
   include weakly oilwet to mixed-wet carbonate rocks. The mechanistic
   model captures the effects on oil recovery of both wettability
   alteration and/or dissolution/fines migration through changes in the
   molar Gibbs free energy. This model can now be used for oil-recovery
   predictions and optimization of LSWI field applications.}},

Abstract = {{We have applied UTCHEM-IPhreeqc to investigate low-salinity (LS)
   waterflooding and LS surfactant (LSS) flooding. Numerical-simulation
   results were compared with laboratory experiments reported by Alagic and
   Skauge (2010). UTCHEM-IPhreeqc combines the UTCHEM numerical
   chemical-flooding simulator with IPhreeqc, the United States Geological
   Survey geochemical model. The IPhreeqc model was coupled to UTCHEM to
   model LS waterflooding as a function of geochemical reactions. The
   surfactant coreflood experiments were performed in vertical cores
   without using polymer or other mobility-control agents. These
   experiments were performed at a velocity greater than the critical
   velocity for a gravity-stable flood. After history matching the
   experiments, additional numerical simulations of surfactant floods at
   the critical velocity were run to estimate the performance under stable
   conditions. We also simulated a surfactant flood at higher salinity with
   lower interfacial tension (IFT) and compared the results with the LSS
   flood. These results provide new insights into LS waterflooding and
   surfactant flooding. Addition of surfactants prevents the retrapping of
   oil that was initially mobilized using LS-brine injection. The results
   show that the proper selection of surfactant and the design of the
   surfactant flood might surpass the potential benefits of LS
   waterflooding in terms of both higher oil recovery and lower cost.
   Specially, a more-effective method is expected in a stable design with
   no preflood.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic simulation study of gravity-stable surfactant flooding was
   performed to understand the conditions under which it is practical and
   to optimize its performance. Different optimization schemes were
   introduced to minimize the effects of geologic parameters and to improve
   the performance and the economics of surfactant floods. The simulations
   were carried out by use of horizontal wells in heterogeneous reservoirs.
   The results show that one can perform gravity-stable surfactant floods
   at a reasonable velocity and with very-high sweep efficiencies for
   reservoirs with high vertical permeability. These simulations were
   carried out with a 3D fine grid and a third-order finite-difference
   method to accurately model fingering. A sensitivity study was conducted
   to investigate the effects of heterogeneity and well spacing. The
   simulations were performed with realistic surfactant properties on the
   basis of laboratory experiments. The critical velocity for a stable
   surfactant flood is a function of the microemulsion (ME) viscosity, and
   it turns out there is an optimum value that one can use to significantly
   increase the velocity and still be stable. One can optimize the salinity
   gradient to gradually change the ME viscosity. Another alternative is to
   inject a low-concentration polymer drive following the surfactant slug
   (without polymer). Polymer complicates the process and adds to its cost
   without a significant benefit in most gravity-stable surfactant floods,
   but an exception is when the reservoir is highly layered. The effect of
   an aquifer on gravity-stable surfactant floods was also investigated,
   and strategies were developed for minimizing its effect on the process.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon production from unconventional resources such as shale
   usually entails stimulation by hydraulic fracturing, which results in
   nonplanar (curved) fractures. However, most reservoir models assume that
   the induced fractures are planar for the sake of simplicity. Considering
   the growing interest of the petroleum industry in better understanding
   production from these resources, we develop a fracture-cell model to
   capture the effects of fracture nonplanarity on transport properties.
   To build a realistic reservoir model for a fractured formation, we must
   account for three types of interactions: matrix-matrix (M-M),
   matrix-fracture (M-F), and fracture-fracture (F-F). The transport
   properties of the M-M interaction are based on laboratory measurements.
   In this study, we analytically determine the transport properties of the
   two other types of interactions (M-F and F-F). For this purpose, we
   account for the aperture size and spatial location of the fracture. As a
   result, we provide effective porosity and effective anisotropic
   permeabilities for a reservoir cell that contains a fracture inside it.
   The reservoir cell with transport properties that are modified is a
   fracture cell.
   We implement the fracture-cell model in a reservoir simulator and
   perform analyses for a single fracture and for multiple intersecting
   fractures; these fractures are nonplanar. The analyses include both
   single-and multiphase flow models and show that the hydrocarbon pressure
   inside the reservoir is strongly dependent on the fracture geometry when
   the matrix permeability is smaller than 1 mu d. Thus, it is crucial to
   model the fracture geometry more accurately in unconventional reservoirs
   with ultralow permeabilities such as shale.
   One can easily implement the developed fracture-cell model in reservoir
   simulators, and there is no local refinement around the fracture. The
   main advantage of the proposed model is its simplicity, conjoined with
   its ability to capture the nonplanarity of the fracture. The developed
   model has major applications for understanding production from
   formations that are heavily fractured.}},

   phase-field approach to model fracture propagation in a porous medium.
   This approach is thermodynamically consistent and captures several
   characteristic features of crack propagation such as joining, branching,
   and nonplanar propagation as a result of heterogeneous material
   properties. We describe two different phase-field fracture-propagation
   models and then present a technique for coupling these to a
   fractured-poroelastic-reservoir simulator. The proposed coupling
   approach can be adapted to existing reservoir simulators. We present 2D
   and 3D numerical tests to benchmark, compare, and demonstrate the
   predictive capabilities of the fracture-propagation model as well as the
   proposed coupling scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous multiple-fracture treatments in horizontal wellbores are
   becoming a prevalent approach to economically develop unconventional
   resources in shale reservoirs. One challenge to efficiently use the
   technique is the generation of effective hydraulic fractures from all
   perforation clusters. In this work, we conducted a fundamental study of
   physical mechanisms controlling simultaneous multiple-fracture
   propagation and discussed the potential approaches to improve nonuniform
   development of multiple fractures. This study was investigated by our
   recently developed 3D fracture-propagation model that captures the
   coupled elastic deformation of the rock with fluid flow in the
   horizontal wellbore and within the fractures. The model demonstrated
   that fracture geometry was controlled by both the stress-shadow effects
   and dynamic partitioning of flow rate. The analysis results indicated
   that the nonuniform development of a multiple-fracture array, for
   example, a three-fracture array in this study, was induced by the uneven
   partitioning of flow rate into each fracture, which was dependent on the
   flow resistance from wellbore friction, perforation friction, and
   fracture propagation. Furthermore, the stress shadowing from the
   exterior fractures exerted additional stress on the interior fractures
   and increased the resistance of fracture propagation, resulting in the
   interior fractures receiving much less fluid. To minimize the negative
   effects of stress shadowing and favor more-uniform fracture growth, we
   investigated potential approaches to promote uniform partitioning of
   flow rate through adjusting the flow resistance between multiple
   fractures. The results showed that adjusting perforation friction can
   provide an effective way to modify the partitioning of flow rate and
   mitigate the negative effects of stress shadowing. The mechanisms
   investigated in this study are consistent with field observations. Our
   approach can help field operators to improve the effectiveness of
   multiple fracturing treatments and maximize the production.}},

Title = {{A Semianalytical Model for Production Simulation From Nonplanar
   Hydraulic-Fracture Geometry in Tight Oil Reservoirs}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1028-1040}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Two key technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic
   fracturing have led to the economic production of unconventional
   resources such as shale gas and tight oil. In reality, a nonplanar
   hydraulic-fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture
   permeability is created during the hydraulic-fracturing process.
   However, it is challenging to simulate well performance from the
   nonplanar fracture geometry. For the sake of simplicity, the nonplanar
   fracture geometry is often represented by ideal planar fracture geometry
   with constant fracture width, which one can easily handle analytically,
   semianalytically, and numerically. However, such ideal fracture geometry
   is inadequate to capture the physics of the transient flow behavior of
   the nonplanar fracture geometry. Although significant efforts were made
   in recent years to numerically model well performance from the complex
   fracture geometry, these approaches are still challenging to model the
   nonplanar fracture geometry with varying width because of a large
   considerable fracture-gridding issues and an expensive computation cost.
   In addition, the effect of nonplanar fracture geometry on well
   productivity and transient flow behavior was not reported in the
   literature. Hence, a model to handle the nonplanar fracture geometry by
   considering varying fracture width and fracture permeability is still
   lacking in the petroleum industry. Zhou et al. (2014) proposed a
   semianalytical model to handle the complex fracture geometry with
   constant fracture width. However, the semianalytical model did not
   consider the effects of stress-dependent fracture conductivity and the
   nonplanar fracture geometry as well as planar fracture geometry with
   varying fracture width along the fracture. In this work, we extended the
   semianalytical model to simulate production from the nonplanar fracture
   geometry as well as planar fracture geometry with varying width. In
   addition, the effect of stress-dependent fracture conductivity was
   implemented in the model. We verified the semianalytical model against a
   numerical reservoir simulator for single planar fracture with constant
   width. We performed two case studies. The first case contains a
   comparison of two planar fractures, one with constant fracture width and
   another with varying fracture width. In the second study, we compared
   two fractures with different fracture geometries such as planar fracture
   geometry and nonplanar fracture geometry, which were generated from the
   fracture-propagation model. In addition, transient flow regimes were
   investigated on the basis of a log-log graph of the dimensionless
   pressure drop and pressure-drop derivative vs. the dimensionless time.
   This work can provide critical insights into understanding the well
   performance from tight oil reservoirs with the nonplanar
   hydraulic-fracture geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles such as liposomes may be used as drug delivery vehicles
   for brain tumor therapy. Particle geometry and electrostatic properties
   have been hypothesized to be important determinants of effective tumor
   targeting after intraarterial injection. In this study, we investigate
   the combined roles of liposome size and surface charge on the
   effectiveness of delivery to gliomas after intraarterial injection.
   Intracarotid injection of liposomes was performed in separate cohorts of
   both healthy and C6 glioma-bearing Sprague Dawley rats after induction
   of transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Large (200 nm) and small (60-80 nm)
   fluorescent dyeloaded liposomes that were either cationic or neutral in
   surface charge were utilized. Delivery effectiveness was quantitatively
   measured both with real-time, in vivo and postmortem diffuse reflectance
   spectroscopy. Semi-quantitative multispectral fluorescence imaging was
   also utilized to assess the pattern and extent of liposome targeting
   within tumors. Large cationic liposomes demonstrated the most effective
   hemispheric and glioma targeting of all the liposomes tested. Selective
   large cationic liposome retention at the site of glioma growth was
   observed. The liposome deposition pattern within tumors after
   intraarterial injection was variable with both core penetration and
   peripheral deposition observed in specific tumors. This study provides
   evidence that liposome size and charge are important determinants of
   effective brain and glioma targeting after intraarterial injection. Our
   results support the future development of 200-nm cationic liposomal
   formulations of candidate intraarterial anti-glioma agents for further
   pre-clinical testing.}},

Abstract = {{In several data center settings, each arriving job may only be served by
   one of a subset of servers. Such a graph constraint can arise due to
   several reasons. One is locality of the data needed by a job; for
   example, in content farms (e.g., in Netflix or YouTube) a video request
   can only be served by a machine that possesses a copy. Motivated by
   this, we consider a setting where each job, on arrival, reveals a
   deadline and a subset of servers that can serve it. The job needs to be
   immediately allocated to one of these servers, and cannot be moved
   thereafter. Our objective is to maximize the fraction of jobs that are
   served before their deadlines. For this online load balancing problem,
   we prove an upper bound of on the competitive ratio of nonpreemptive
   online algorithms for systems with a large number of servers. We propose
   an algorithm-INSERT RANKING-which achieves this upper bound. The
   algorithm makes decisions in a correlated random way and it is inspired
   by the work of Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani on online matching for
   bipartite graphs. We also show that two more natural algorithms, based
   on independent randomness, are strictly suboptimal, with a competitive
   ratio of 1/2.}},

Abstract = {{Web computing is gradually shifting toward mobile devices, in which the
   energy budget is severely constrained. As a result, Web developers must
   be conscious of energy efficiency. However, current Web languages
   provide developers little control over energy consumption. In this
   paper, we take a first step toward language-level research to enable
   energy-efficient Web computing. Our key motivation is that mobile
   systems can wisely budget energy usage if informed with user
   quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. To do this, programmers need new
   abstractions. We propose two language abstractions, QoS type and QoS
   target, to capture two fundamental aspects of user QoS experience. We
   then present Green Web, a set of language extensions that empower
   developers to easily express the QoS abstractions as program
   annotations. As a proof of concept, we develop a GreenWeb runtime, which
   intelligently determines how to deliver specified user QoS expectation
   while minimizing energy consumption. Overall, GreenWeb shows significant
   energy savings (29.2\% similar to 66.0\%) over Android's default
   Interactive governor with few QoS violations. Our work demonstrates a
   promising first step toward language innovations for energy-efficient
   Web computing.}},

Abstract = {{Oil and gas companies are drilling and developing fields in the Arctic
   Ocean, which is an environment with ice floes. These companies must
   protect their platforms from ice floe collisions. One proposal is to use
   a system that consists of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and
   docking stations. The AUVs measure the under-water topography of the ice
   floes, while the docking stations launch the AUVs and recharge their
   batteries. Given resource constraints, we optimize locations and
   quantities for the docking stations and the AUVs, as well as the AUV
   scheduling policies, to maximize security of the platform. We model the
   system using a multistage stochastic facility location problem to
   optimize the docking station locations, the AUV allocations, and the
   scheduling policies of the AUVs. A two-stage stochastic facility
   location problem and two efficient online scheduling heuristics provide
   lower bounds and upper bounds for the multistage model. Even though the
   model is motivated by an oil industry project, most of the modeling and
   optimization methods apply more broadly to two-dimensional radial
   detection.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Interference management has the potential to improve spectrum efficiency
   in current and next generation wireless systems ( e.g., 3GPP LTE and
   IEEE 802.11). Recently, new paradigms for interference management have
   emerged to tackle interference in a general class of wireless networks:
   interference shaping and interference exploitation. Interference shaping
   is a technique that creates a particular linear combination of
   interference signals when transmitters propagate signals to minimize the
   aggregated interference effect at each receiver. Interference
   exploitation is a method that harnesses interference in decoding as side
   information to improve data rates. Both approaches offer better
   performance in interference-limited communication regimes than
   traditionally thought possible. This article provides a high-level
   overview of several different interference shaping and exploitation
   techniques for single-hop, multihop, and multi-way network architectures
   with graphical illustrations. The article concludes with a discussion of
   practical challenges associated with adopting sophisticated interference
   management strategies in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This study involved the development of a model for evaluating the
   potential costs and benefits of ozone control by activated carbon
   filtration in single-family homes. The modeling effort included the
   prediction of indoor ozone with and without activated carbon filtration
   in the HVAC system. As one application, the model was used to predict
   benefit-to-cost ratios for single-family homes in 12 American cities in
   five different climate zones. Health benefits were evaluated using
   disability-adjusted life-years and included city-specific age
   demographics for each simulation. Costs of commercially available
   activated carbon filters included capital cost differences when compared
   to conventional HVAC filters of similar particle removal efficiency,
   energy penalties due to additional pressure drop, and regional utility
   rates. The average indoor ozone removal effectiveness ranged from 4 to
   20\% across the 12 target cities and was largely limited by HVAC system
   operation time. For the parameters selected in this study, the mean
   predicted benefit-to-cost ratios for 1-inch filters were >1.0 in 10 of
   the 12 cities. The benefits of residential activated carbon filters were
   greatest in cities with high seasonal ozone and HVAC usage, suggesting
   the importance of targeting such conditions for activated carbon filter
   applications.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Productivity and project performance can be improved through
   implementing best practices. This paper describes the development of a
   best productivity practices implementation index (BPPII) for
   infrastructure projects. The index is a checklist of practices that are
   considered to have a positive influence on labor productivity at the
   project level for infrastructure projects. These practices have been
   grouped together into a formalized set of categories, sections, and
   elements. Each practice and its planning and implementation levels were
   defined and assigned a relative weight on the basis of its importance in
   affecting labor productivity. The productivity factor (PF), defined as a
   ratio of estimated productivity and actual productivity, was used as a
   metric to collect information about labor productivity to validate the
   accuracy of the BPPII for infrastructure projects. Data were collected
   for infrastructure projects in regards to their planning and
   implementation level of practices in addition to their PF and project
   schedule performance. The statistical tests confirmed that the higher
   implementation of best practices as defined in the index have a strong
   positive relationship with the PF and project schedule performance.
   Projects that have a high level of implementation of practices
   experienced better productivity and schedule performance than those
   having low implementation. This research contributes new insight into
   the relationships between sets of practices and project performance as
   well as a tool for planning practice implementation on infrastructure
   projects. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{BLIS is a new software framework for instantiating high-performance

   demonstrate the framework include state-of-the-art general-purpose,
   low-power, and many-core architectures. We show, with very little
   effort, how the BLIS framework yields sequential and parallel
   implementations that are competitive with the performance of ATLAS,
   OpenBLAS (an effort to maintain and extend the GotoBLAS), and commercial
   vendor implementations such as AMD's ACML, IBM's ESSL, and Intel's MKL
   libraries. Although most of this article focuses on single-core
   implementation, we also provide compelling results that suggest the
   framework's leverage extends to the multithreaded domain.}},

Abstract = {{Since introduced by Allen J. Bard and co-workers in 1986, scanning
   electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has been used as a powerful scanning
   probe technique in wide variety of fields, such as metal anti-corrosion,
   material characterization, biomedicine and new energy technology. In
   recent years, SECM plays a. more and more important role in the field of
   photoelectrochemical energy research. In this paper, we introduce the
   basic principle as well as feedback and generation-collection
   operation-modes of SECM and highlight some of the recent advances on
   SECM applied to studies of solar cell and solar water splitting. SECM
   coupling with light source used as an effective tool for investigating
   interfacial charge transfer process and the regeneration kinetics of
   dyes in dye-sensitized solar cell are described. Additionally, SECM used
   as a powerful screening technique for developing efficient
   photocatalysts is discussed. Furthermore, we provide a brief research
   example that related SECM used as a combinatorial screening technique to
   investigate III A, IV A and V A group metal ions as dopants for WO3 for
   photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This work has been conducted in
   our group recently, and it is reported for the first time. The details
   of this work are presented, including preparing doped WO, arrays on FTO
   glass substrate, setting up SECM testing system, photoelectrochemical
   scanning doped WO, arrays, screening scan results and proving scan
   results on scaled-up films. The SECM screening results show that 2\%
   similar to 4\% In doped WO3, 2\% similar to 4\% Sn4+ doped WO3 and 4\%
   6\% Sb5+ doped WO, have higher photoelectrochemical activity than
   un-doped WO3. On the basis of research results, it is concluded that
   SECM is a convenient and efficient screening technique, has a promising
   application prospect in the development of photocatalysts. Finally, we
   briefly describe and forecast the development trend of SECM in the field
   of photoelectrochemical energy research.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce noncontact optical microscopy and optical scattering to
   characterize asphalt binder microstructure at temperatures ranging from
   15 degrees C to 85 degrees C for two compositionally different asphalt
   binders. We benchmark optical measurements against rheometric
   measurements of the magnitude of the temperature-dependent bulk complex
   shear modulus vertical bar G{*}(T)vertical bar. The main findings are:
   (1) Elongated (similar to 5 x 1 mu m), striped microstructures (known
   from AFM studies as `bees' because they resemble bumble-bees) are
   resolved optically, found to reside primarily at the surface and do not
   reappear immediately after a single heating-cooling cycle. (2) Smaller
   (similar to 1 mu m(2)) microstructures with no observable internal
   structure (hereafter dubbed `ants'), are found to reside primarily in
   the bulk, to persist aftermultiple thermal cycles and to scatter light
   strongly. Optical scattering from `ants' decreases to zero with heating
   from 15 degrees C to 65 degrees C, but recovers completely upon cooling
   back to 15 degrees C, albeit with distinct hysteresis. (3) Rheometric
   measurements of vertical bar G{*}(T)vertical bar reveal hysteresis that
   closely resembles that observed by optical scatter, suggesting that
   thermally driven changes in microstructure volume fraction cause
   corresponding changes in vertical bar G{*}(T)vertical bar.}},

Abstract = {{The use of cylindrical elastic shells as elements in acoustic
   metamaterial devices is demonstrated through simulations and underwater
   measurements of a cylindrical-to-plane wave lens. Transformation
   acoustics of a circular region to a square dictate that the effective
   density in the lens remain constant and equal to that of water.
   Piecewise approximation to the desired effective compressibility is
   achieved using a square array with elements based on the elastic shell
   metamaterial concept developed by Titovich and Norris {[}J. Acoust. Soc.
   Am. 136(4), 1601-1609 (2014)]. The sizes of the elements are chosen
   based on availability of shells, minimizing fabrication difficulties.
   The tested device is neutrally buoyant comprising 48 elements of nine
   different types of commercial shells made from aluminum, brass, copper,
   and polymers. Simulations indicate a broadband range in which the device
   acts as a cylindrical to plane wave lens. The experimental findings
   confirm the broadband quadropolar response from approximately 20 to 40
   kHz, with positive gain of the radiation pattern in the four plane wave
   directions. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Title = {{Floquet topological insulators for sound}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The unique conduction properties of condensed matter systems with
   topological order have recently inspired a quest for the similar effects
   in classical wave phenomena. Acoustic topological insulators, in
   particular, hold the promise to revolutionize our ability to control
   sound, allowing for large isolation in the bulk and broadband one-way
   transport along their edges, with topological immunity against
   structural defects and disorder. So far, these fascinating properties
   have been obtained relying on moving media, which may introduce noise
   and absorption losses, hindering the practical potential of topological
   acoustics. Here we overcome these limitations by modulating in time the
   acoustic properties of a lattice of resonators, introducing the concept
   of acoustic Floquet topological insulators. We show that acoustic waves
   provide a fertile ground to apply the anomalous physics of Floquet
   topological insulators, and demonstrate their relevance for a wide range
   of acoustic applications, including broadband acoustic isolation and
   topologically protected, nonreciprocal acoustic emitters.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Optical activity and circular dichroism are fascinating physical
   phenomena originating from the interaction of light with chiral
   molecules or other nano objects lacking mirror symmetries in
   three-dimensional (3D) space. While chiral optical properties are weak
   in most of naturally occurring materials, they can be engineered and
   significantly enhanced in synthetic optical media known as chiral
   metamaterials, where the spatial symmetry of their building blocks is
   broken on a nanoscale. Although originally discovered in 3D structures,
   circular dichroism can also emerge in a two-dimensional (2D)
   metasurface. The origin of the resulting circular dichroism is rather
   subtle, and is related to non-radiative (Ohmic) dissipation of the
   constituent metamolecules. Because such dissipation occurs on a
   nanoscale, this effect has never been experimentally probed and
   visualized. Using a suite of recently developed nanoscale-measurement
   tools, we establish that the circular dichroism in a nanostructured
   metasurface occurs due to handedness-dependent Ohmic heating.}},

Abstract = {{Ternary two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide compounds
   exhibit a tunable electronic structure allowing for control of the
   interlayer and the intralayer atomic displacement to efficiently tune
   their physical and electronic properties. Using a diamond anvil cell,
   hydrostatic pressure was applied to Mo0.5W0.5S2 up to 40 GPa in order to
   study the optical phonon vibrational modes. Analysis of the
   high-pressure Raman spectra shows that the two in-plane Egg modes
   resembling that of pristine MoS2 and WS2, as well as disorder-activated
   longitudinal acoustic phonon mode, are hardened and suppressed as
   pressure increases. The two Aig modes of the ternary compound that
   resemble the Ai g modes of pristine MoS2 and WS2, displayed similar
   Raman shifts to the pristine compounds as pressure increases. A Raman
   peak at 470 cm(-1) that is close to Aig peaks emerges at 8 GPa, which
   represents a disorder-activated pressure-induced out-of-plane Raman mode
   observed only in the ternary compound under high pressure. At pressures
   above 30 GPa, a Raman peak at approximately 340 cm(-1) is observed,
   signifying additional disorder-activated vibration mode. Our results
   reveal the enhanced interactions in the structural and vibrational
   behavior of the MoS2 and WS2 domains in the Mo0.5W0.5S2 compound under
   hydrostatic pressure. These results could have implications in
   understanding the electronic, optical, and structural properties of the
   new 2D ternary compound materials under extreme mechanical conditions.}},

   Nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{A new, metastable polymorph of V2O3 with a bixbyite structure was
   recently stabilized in colloidal nanocrystal form. Here, we report the
   reversible incorporation of oxygen in this material, which can be
   controlled by varying temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Based on
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis, we find that
   oxygen occupies interstitial sites in the bixbyite lattice. Two oxygen
   atoms per unit cell can be incorporated rapidly and with minimal changes
   to the structure while the addition of three or more oxygen atoms
   destabilizes the structure, resulting in a phase change that can be
   reversed upon oxygen removal. Density functional theory (DFT) supports
   the reversible occupation of interstitial sites in bixbyite by oxygen,
   and the 1.1 eV barrier to oxygen diffusion predicted by DFT matches the
   activation energy of the oxidation process derived from observations by
   in situ XRD. The observed rapid oxidation kinetics are thus facilitated
   by short diffusion paths through the bixbyite nanocrystals. Due to the
   exceptionally low temperatures of oxidation and reduction, this earth
   abundant material is proposed for use in oxygen storage applications.}},

Title = {{Stiffness Behavior of Cross Frames in Steel Bridge Systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cross frames are critical structural elements in both straight and
   horizontally curved steel bridges. In order to properly size the brace
   for the strength and stiffness demands of the superstructure, an
   accurate model of the elements comprising the cross frame is required.
   Conventional details most commonly used for cross frames consist of
   single-angle members connected to form a truss system linking adjacent
   girders together. Most analyses of the bridges treat the cross frames as
   truss elements that primarily resist applied forces through the axial
   stiffness of the members. This paper documents the results of a research
   study that included full-scale laboratory tests to measure the stiffness
   and strength of cross frames utilizing both conventional and new
   details. The tests showed that analytical solutions, as well as computer
   models, that are routinely used to model the cross frames in analysis
   software can overestimate the in-plane stiffness of the brace by more
   than 100\%. The primary reason for the discrepancy in the stiffness
   models was identified to be connection eccentricities that exist in
   cross frames comprised of single-angle members welded to a gusset plate
   through only one leg of the angle. Overestimating the stiffness of the
   braces during construction can lead to unsafe conditions, as well as
   errors in the geometry of the constructed bridge, resulting from
   underpredictions of deformations during concrete placement. Extensive
   parametric analyses were carried out using validated finite-element
   models to develop correction factors that can be applied to analytical
   and computer models to significantly improve the accuracy of the
   simplified models that are used for the cross-frame systems. The
   correction factors allow a designer to utilize a computationally
   efficient model for the cross frame while also including the reduction
   in stiffness that is caused by connection eccentricities. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Anticoagulation for Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation
   IntroductionAppropriate activated clotting time (ACT) during catheter
   ablation of atrial fibrillation (CA-AF) is essential to minimize
   periprocedural complications.
   Methods and ResultsAn electronic search was performed using major
   databases. Outcomes were thromboembolic (TE) and bleeding complications
   according to ACT levels (seconds). Heparin dose (U/kg) and time
   (minutes) to achieve the target ACT was compared among patients
   receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) versus non-VKA oral anticoagulants
   (NOAC). Nineteen studies involving 7,150 patients were identified.
   Patients with ACT > 300 had less TE (OR, 0.51; 95\% CI 0.35-0.74) and
   bleeding (OR, 0.70; 95\% CI 0.60-0.83) compared to ACT < 300, when using
   any type of oral anticoagulation. The use of VKA was associated with
   reduced heparin requirements (mean dose: 157 U/kg vs. 209 U/kg, P <
   0.03; SDM -0.86 {[}95\% CI -1.39 to -0.33]), and with lower time to
   achieve the target ACT (mean time: 24 minutes vs. 49 minutes, P < 0.03;
   SDM -11.02 {[}95\% CI -13.29 to -8.75]) compared to NOACs. No
   significant publication bias was found.
   ConclusionsPerforming CA-AF with a target ACT > 300 decreases the risk
   of TE without increasing the risk of bleeding. Patients receiving VKAs
   required less heparin and reached the target ACT faster compared to
   NOACs.}},

   optimization. We introduce biomechanical, morphological, and controller
   measures to optimize the exoskeleton performance. A major advantage of
   the framework is that it provides a platform for carrying out
   hypothesis-driven virtual experiments to quantify device performance and

Abstract = {{This paper applies a novel decision making methodology to a case study
   involving choices leading to the transition from the current
   once-through light water reactor fuel cycle to one relying on continuous
   recycle of plutonium and minor actinides in fast reactors in the face of
   uncertain fast reactor capital costs. Unique to this work is a
   multi-stage treatment of a range of plausible trajectories for the
   evolution of fast reactor capital costs over time, characterized by
   first-of-a-kind penalties as well as time- and unit-based learning. The
   methodology explicitly incorporates uncertainties in key parameters into
   the decision making process by constructing a stochastic model and
   embedding uncertainties as bifurcations in the decision tree.
   ``Hedging{''} strategies are found by applying a choice criterion to
   select courses of action which mitigate ``regrets{''}. These regrets are
   calculated by evaluating the performance of all possible transition
   strategies for every feasible outcome of the uncertain parameter. The
   hedging strategies are those that preserve the most flexibility for

Abstract = {{Monoclonal antibody-based drugs continue to be one of the most rapidly
   growing classes of therapeutic molecules. At present, the majority of
   approved therapeutic antibodies are of the human IgG1 format, which can
   elicit immune effector functions (e.g., antibody-dependent cellular
   cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and complement
   dependent cytotoxicity). However, there is a wealth of functional
   diversity that is present in other isotypes and IgG subclasses that can
   be exploited to improve clinical safety and performance by increasing
   stability, reduction of adverse events, modulation of effector
   functions, and by the engagement of two antigens by a single antibody.
   This review presents an overview of the different antibody isotypes and
   subclasses and details how exchanging amino acids between different
   isotypes (Le., `cross-isotypes') can be exploited to generate novel
   therapeutic platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The Standard Simplex Conjecture and the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture
   are two conjectures stating that certain partitions are optimal with
   respect to Gaussian and discrete noise stability respectively. These two
   conjectures are natural generalizations of the Gaussian noise stability

   Here we show that the standard simplex is not the most stable partition
   in Gaussian space and that Plurality is not the most stable low
   influence partition in discrete space for every number of parts k a
   parts per thousand yen 3, for every value rho not equal 0 of the noise
   and for every prescribed measure for the different parts as long as they
   are not all equal to 1/k. Our results do not contradict the original
   statements of the Plurality is Stablest and Standard Simplex Conjectures
   in their original statements concerning partitions to sets of equal
   measure. However, they indicate that if these conjectures are true,
   their veracity and their proofs will crucially rely on assuming that the
   sets are of equal measures, in stark contrast to Borell's result, the
   Majority is Stablest Theorem and many other results in isoperimetric
   theory. Given our results it is natural to ask for (conjectured)

Abstract = {{Technological advances are bringing connected and autonomous vehicles
   (CAVs) to the ever-evolving transportation system. Anticipating public
   acceptance and adoption of these technologies is important. A recent
   internet-based survey polled 347 Austinites to understand their opinions
   on smart-car technologies and strategies. Results indicate that
   respondents perceive fewer crashes to be the primary benefit of
   autonomous vehicles (AVs), with equipment failure being their top
   concern. Their average willingness to pay (WTP) for adding full (Level
   4) automation (\$7253) appears to be much higher than that for adding
   partial (Level 3) automation (\$3300) to their current vehicles.
   Ordered probit and other model specifications estimate the impact of
   demographics, built-environment variables, and travel characteristics on
   Austinites' WTP for adding various automation technologies and
   connectivity to their current and coming vehicles. It also estimates
   adoption rates of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) under different
   pricing scenarios (\$1, \$2, and \$3 per mile), choice dependence on
   friends' and neighbors' adoption rates, and home-location decisions
   after AVs and SAVs become a common mode of transport. Higher-income,
   technology-savvy males, who live in urban areas, and those who have
   experienced more crashes have a greater interest in and higher WTP for
   the new technologies, with less dependence on others' adoption rates.
   Such behavioral models are useful to simulate long-term adoption of CAV
   technologies under different vehicle pricing and demographic scenarios.
   These results can be used to develop smarter transportation systems for
   more efficient and sustainable travel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Boundary layer flashback of swirling turbulent lean-premixed
   methane-hydrogen-air flames is investigated in a model combustor
   featuring a mixing tube with center body. The focus of our work is on
   improving the understanding of the flow-flame interaction during
   flashback. We combine high-speed chemiluminescence imaging, stereoscopic
   and tomographic particle image velocimetry, and a three-dimensional
   flame front reconstruction technique to reveal the time-resolved,
   volumetric velocity field in the vicinity of the flame front during
   flashback. We find two different ways in which a flame front propagates
   upstream along the center body wall. The first mode concerns small-scale
   bulges counter propagating into the approach flow, similar to
   channel-flow flashback, but is found not to be a dominant propagation
   mechanism. Instead, flashback occurs primarily in the form of
   large-scale flame tongues swirling in the bulk flow direction as they
   propagate upstream. The approach flow is modified significantly in both
   cases, but the scale and nature of the resulting velocity fields differ
   fundamentally. A key characteristic of the approach flow found
   previously, both in channel and swirl flame flashback, is regions of
   negative axial velocity upstream of the flame front. We reveal, however,
   that in the case of swirl flames the region of negative axial velocity
   is the result of a primarily swirling motion ahead of the leading flame
   tongue in contrast to the reverse flow pockets ahead of small-scale
   bulges. The boundary layer neither separates nor does fluid recirculate
   in the negative axial velocity region upstream of the flame tongues.
   Instead, flame tongues impose a local blockage effect causing
   significant deflection of the approach flow, which results in a constant
   region of negative axial velocity for the leading side of the flame
   tongue to propagate into. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf

Abstract = {{The use of geosynthetic reinforcements placed underneath asphalt
   overlays, which has been typically used to minimise problems associated
   with reflective cracking, is evaluated in this study as an approach to
   improve pavement structural capacity. Whereas geosynthetics have been
   used to increase the pavement structural performancewhen used to
   reinforce the base aggregate, as reported in numerous laboratory and
   evaluations experiments, such improvement has not been evaluated for the
   case of geosynthetics within asphalt layers. Accordingly, this paper
   presents the results of large model tests involving both reinforced and
   unreinforced hot mix asphalt overlays. Cyclic wheel loads were applied
   using an accelerated pavement test facility that was specifically
   developed for this research. A number of pavement sections were
   constructed using a polyvinyl alcohol geogrid as reinforcement
   inclusions. The results show a considerable increase in pavements
   structural performance, as quantified by reduction of strains in the
   asphalt concrete layers, in the vertical stresses within the pavement
   layers and in the resilient displacements at the wearing surface. The
   use of geogrid reinforcements was also found to lead to reduce rutting
   and permanent lateral movements in the surface layer. Overall, the use
   of geogrids within asphalt overlays was found to act as a reinforcement
   element that provide enhanced structural capacity to flexible pavements.}},

Abstract = {{Strong interaction of graphene with light accounts for one of its most
   remarkable properties: the ability to absorb 2.3\% of the incident
   lights energy within a single atomic layer. Free carrier injection via
   field-effect gating can dramatically vary the optical properties of
   graphene, thereby enabling fast graphene-based modulators of the light
   intensity. However, the very thinness of graphene makes it difficult to
   modulate the other fundamental property of the light wave: its optical
   phase. Here we demonstrate that considerable phase control can be
   achieved by integrating a single-layer graphene (SLG) with a resonant
   plasmonic metasurface that contains nanoscale gaps. By concentrating the
   light intensity inside of the nanogaps, the metasurface dramatically
   increases the coupling of light to the SLG and enables control of the
   phase of the reflected mid-infrared light by as much as 55 degrees via
   field-effect gating. We experimentally demonstrate graphene-based phase
   modulators that maintain the amplitude of the reflected light
   essentially constant over most of the phase tuning range. Rapid
   nonmechanical phase modulation enables a new experimental technique,
   graphene-based laser interferometry, which we use to demonstrate motion
   detection with nanoscale precision. We also demonstrate that by the
   judicious choice of a strongly anisotropic metasurface the
   graphene-controlled phase shift of light can be rendered
   polarization-dependent. Using the experimentally measured phases for the
   two orthogonal polarizations, we demonstrate that the polarization state
   of the reflected light can be by modulated by carrier injection into the
   SLG. These results pave the way for novel high-speed graphene-based
   optical devices and sensors such as polarimeters, ellipsometers, and
   frequency modulators.}},

Abstract = {{Doped semiconductor nanocrystals are an emerging class of materials
   hosting localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) over a wide optical
   range. Studies so far have focused. on tuning LSPR frequency by
   controlling the dopant and carrier concentrations in diverse
   semiconductor materials. However, the influence of anisotropic
   nano-crystal shape and of intrinsic crystal structure on LSPR remain
   poorly explored. Here, we illustrate how these two factors collaborate
   to determine, LSPR characteristics in hexagonal cesium-doped tungsten
   oxide nanocrystals. The effect of shape anisotropy is systematically
   analyzed via synthetic control of nanocrystal aspect ratio (AR), from
   disks to nanorods. We demonstrate the dominant influence of crystalline
   anisotropy, which uniquely causes strong LSPR band-splitting into two
   distinct peaks with comparable intensities. Modeling typically used to
   rationalize particle shape effects is refined by taking into account the
   anisotropic dielectric function due to crystalline anisotropy, thus
   fully accounting for the AR-dependent evolution of multiband LSPR
   spectra. This new insight into LSPR Of semiconductor nanocrystals
   provides a novel strategy for an exquisite tuning of LSPR line shape.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterials made of nanoscale inclusions or artificial unit cells
   exhibit exotic optical properties that do not exist in natural
   materials. Promising applications, such as super-resolution imaging,
   cloaking, hyperbolic propagation, and ultrafast phase velocities have
   been demonstrated based on mostly micrometer-scale metamaterials and few
   nanoscale metamaterials. To date, most metamaterials are created using
   costly and tedious fabrication techniques with limited paths toward
   reliable large-scale fabrication. In this work, we demonstrate the
   one-step direct growth of self-assembled epitaxial metal oxide
   nanocomposites as a drastically different approach to fabricating
   large-area nanostructured metamaterials. Using pulsed laser deposition,
   we fabricated nanocomposite films with vertically aligned gold (Au)
   nanopillars (similar to 20 nm in diameter) embedded in various oxide
   matrices with high epitaxial quality. Strong, broad absorption features
   in the measured absorbance spectrum are clear signatures of plasmon
   resonances of Au nanopillars. By tuning their densities on selected
   substrates, anisotropic optical properties are demonstrated via angular
   dependent and polarization resolved reflectivity measurements and
   reproduced by full-wave simulations and effective medium theory. Our
   model predicts exotic properties, such as zero permittivity responses
   and topological transitions. Our studies suggest that these
   self-assembled metal oxide nanostructures provide an exciting new
   material platform to control and enhance optical response at nanometer
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{T cells recognize and kill amyriad of pathogen-infected or cancer cells
   using a diverse set of T cell receptors (TCRs). The affinity of TCR to
   cognate antigen is of high interest in adoptive T cell transfer
   immunotherapy and antigen-specific T cell repertoire immune profiling
   because it is widely known to correlate with downstream T cell
   responses. We introduce the in situ TCR affinity and sequence test
   (iTAST) for simultaneous measurement of TCR affinity and sequence from
   single primary CD8(+) T cells in human blood. We demonstrate that the
   repertoire of primary antigen-specific T cells from
   pathogen-inexperienced individuals has a surprisingly broad affinity
   range of 1000-fold composed of diverse TCR sequences. Within this range,
   samples from older individuals contained a reduced frequency of
   high-affinity T cells compared to young individuals, demonstrating an
   age-related effect of T cell attrition that could cause holes in the
   repertoire. iTAST should enable the rapid selection of high-affinity
   TCRs ex vivo for adoptive immunotherapy and measurement of T cell
   response for immune monitoring applications.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major limitations of tissue-engineered cartilage is poor
   integration of chondrocytes and scaffold structures with recipient
   tissue. To overcome this limitation, an expandable scaffold with a
   honeycomb-like structure has been developed using microfluidic
   technology. In this study, we evaluated the performance of this
   expandable gelatin scaffold seeded with rabbit chondrocytes in vivo. The
   chondrocyte/ scaffold constructs were implanted into regions of
   surgically introduced cylindrical osteochondral defects in rabbit
   femoral condyles. At 2, 4, and 6 months postsurgery, the implanted
   constructs were evaluated by gross and histological examinations. As
   expected, the osteochondral defects, which were untreated or
   transplanted with blank scaffolds, showed no signs of repair, whereas
   the defects transplanted with chondrocyte/ scaffold constructs showed
   significant cartilage regeneration. Furthermore, the expandable
   scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes had more regenerated cartilage tissue
   and better integration with the recipient tissue than autologous
   chondrocyte implantation. Biomechanical tests revealed that the
   chondrocyte/ scaffold group had the highest compressive strength among
   all groups at all three time points and endured a similar compressive
   force to normal cartilage after 6 months of implantation. Histological
   examinations revealed that the chondrocytes were distributed uniformly
   within the scaffolds, maintained a normal phenotype, and secreted
   functional components of the extracellular matrix. Histomorphometric
   assessment showed a remarkable total interface of up to 87\% integration
   of the expandable scaffolds with the host tissue at 6 months
   postoperation. In conclusion, the expandable scaffolds improved
   chondrocyte/ scaffold construct integration with the host tissue and
   were beneficial for cartilage repair.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolution of solid grains in a porous medium is important in many
   applications, such as groundwater transport, carbon storage, mineral
   systems, formation of geologic features, and enhancement of
   near-wellbore permeability in carbonate reservoirs. Many models for
   dissolution in porous media are continuum-scale descriptions, but the
   flow, reactive transport, and subsequent increase in porosity and
   permeability occur at the pore scale. Thus, proper inclusion of
   parametric inputs is challenging. We present a single-phase, 3D, pore
   network model of dissolution for porous media in the
   mass-transfer-limited regime. A novel mass transfer coefficient
   correlation and pore-merging criterion are developed from finite element
   simulations that greatly improve the pore-scale physics and the
   quantitative accuracy of the network. The optimal Damkohler number
   determined from our network simulations closely matches the optimum of
   0.29 reported experimentally for mass transfer dissolution in porous
   media.}},

Abstract = {{The oral administration of hematological factor IX (FIX) can offer a
   convenient prophylactic treatment for hemophilia B patients.
   pH-Responsive hydrogels based on poly(methacrylic
   acid)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (P(MAA-g-EG)) have been engineered
   as delivery vehicles for FIX. In oral delivery, such hydrogel carriers
   protected FIX from the gastric environment and released it under
   intestinal conditions as demonstrated by evaluation of the loading and
   release of FIX. Tailoring of the hydrogel networks improved the loading
   of FIX within the microcarriers, which is critical for minimizing
   protein degradation. Optimizing the loading conditions by increasing the
   incubation time and using a reduced ionic strength buffer further
   improved the delivery potential of the microcarriers. The presence of
   the microcarriers significantly enhanced the oral absorption of FIX in
   vitro. As shown in this work, P(MAA-g-EG) microcarriers are promising
   candidates for the oral delivery of FIX.}},

Abstract = {{Goal: Dermoscopy images often suffer from blur and uneven illumination
   distortions that occur during acquisition, which can adversely influence
   consequent automatic image analysis results on potential lesion objects.
   The purpose of this paper is to deploy an algorithm that can
   automatically assess the quality of dermoscopy images. Such an algorithm
   could be used to direct image recapture or correction. Methods: We
   describe an application-driven no-reference image quality assessment
   (IQA) model for dermoscopy images affected by possibly multiple
   distortions. For this purpose, we created a multiple distortion dataset
   of dermoscopy images impaired by varying degrees of blur and uneven
   illumination. The basis of this model is two single distortion IQA
   metrics that are sensitive to blur and uneven illumination,
   respectively. The outputs of these two metrics are combined to predict
   the quality of multiply distorted dermoscopy images using a fuzzy neural
   network. Unlike traditional IQA algorithms, which use human subjective
   score as ground truth, here ground truth is driven by the application,
   and generated according to the degree of influence of the distortions on
   lesion analysis. Results: The experimental results reveal that the
   proposed model delivers accurate and stable quality prediction results
   for dermoscopy images impaired by multiple distortions. Conclusion: The
   proposed model is effective for quality assessment of multiple distorted
   dermoscopy images. Significance: An application-driven concept for IQA
   is introduced, and at the same time, a solution framework for the IQA of
   multiple distortions is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to its high carrier mobility, conductivity, flexibility and
   optical transparency, graphene is a versatile material in micro- and
   macroelectronics. However, the low density of electrochemically active
   defects in graphene synthesized by chemical vapour deposition limits its
   application in biosensing. Here, we show that graphene doped with gold
   and combined with a gold mesh has improved electrochemical activity over
   bare graphene, sufficient to form a wearable patch for sweat-based
   diabetes monitoring and feedback therapy. The stretchable device
   features a serpentine bilayer of gold mesh and gold-doped graphene that
   forms an efficient electrochemical interface for the stable transfer of
   electrical signals. The patch consists of a heater, temperature,
   humidity, glucose and pH sensors and polymeric microneedles that can be
   thermally activated to deliver drugs transcutaneously. We show that the
   patch can be thermally actuated to deliver Metformin and reduce blood
   glucose levels in diabetic mice.}},

Abstract = {{Global navigation satellite signals can be spoofed by false signals, but
   special receivers can provide defenses against such attacks. The
   development of good spoofing defenses requires an understanding of the
   possible attack modes of a spoofer and the properties of those modes
   that can be exploited for defense purposes. Sets of attack methods and
   defense methods are described in detail. An attack/defense matrix is
   developed that documents which defense techniques are effective against
   the various attack techniques. Recommendations are generated to improve
   the offerings of commercial off-the-shelf receivers from the current
   situation, a complete lack of spoofing defenses, to a situation in which
   various levels of defense are present, some that add significant
   security for relatively little additional cost and others that add more
   security at costs that start to become appreciable.}},

Journal = {{SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear site response analyses are generally preferred over equivalent
   linear analyses for soft soil sites subjected to high-intensity input
   ground motions. However, both nonlinear (NL) and equivalent linear (EQL)
   analyses often result in large shear strain estimates (3-10\%) at soft
   sites, and these large strains may generate unusual characteristics in
   the predicted surface ground motions, such as irregular time histories
   and atypical spectral shapes. One source of unusual ground motion
   predictions may be attributed to unrealistically low shear strengths
   implied by commonly used modulus reduction curves. Therefore, modulus
   reduction and damping curves can be modified at shear strains greater
   than approximately 0.1\% to provide a more realistic soil model for site
   response. However, even after these modifications, nonlinear and
   equivalent linear site response analyses still may generate unusual
   surface acceleration time histories and Fourier amplitude spectra at
   soft soil sites when subjected to high intensity input ground motions.
   In this study, we use equivalent linear and nonlinear 1D site response
   analyses for the well-known Treasure Island site to demonstrate
   challenges associated with accurately modeling large shear strains, and
   subsequent surface response, at soft soil sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended in
   patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, but use of this
   strategy is variable.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether TEE is necessary before AF ablation in
   patients treated with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs).
   METHODS We performed a prospective multicenter registry of AF patients
   undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation on uninterrupted NOACs
   (apixaban and rivaroxaban). All patients were on NOACs for at least 4
   weeks before ablation. Heparin bolus was administered to all patients
   before transseptal catheterization to maintain a target activated
   dotting time above 300 seconds. A subset of 86 patients underwent brain
   diffuse magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to detect silent cerebral
   ischemia (SCI).
   RESULTS A total of 970 patients (514 {[}53\%] apixaban patients and 456
   {[}47\%] rivaroxaban patients) were enrolled for this study. The mean
   age was 69.5 9.0 years, with 824 patients (85\%) having nonparoxysmal
   AF, and 636 patients (65.6\%) were male. The average CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc
   score was 3.01 +/- 1.3 and CHADS(2) score was >= 2 in 609 patients
   (62.8\%). Intracardiac echocardiogram ruled out left atrial appendage
   thrombus in all patients whose left atrial appendage was visualized
   (692, 71\%), and detected ``smoke{''} in 407 patients (42\%). SCI at
   postprocedure dMRI was detected in 2.3\% (2/86). One thromboembolic
   event (transient ischemic attack) (0.10\%) with positive dMRI occurred
   in a patient on uninterrupted rivaroxaban with longstanding persistent
   AF.
   CONCLUSION Our study illustrates that performing AF ablation while on
   uninterrupted apixaban and rivaroxaban without TEE is feasible and safe.
   This finding has important clinical and economic relevance.}},

Title = {{CO2 storage potential and trapping mechanisms in the H-59 block of Jilin

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{267-280}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A CO2 EOR and storage pilot test have been conducted in the H-59 block
   of Jilin oilfield China for well seven years. It is important to track
   the CO2 storage and distribution in the reservoir, which can provide
   valuable guidance for the operation in the next stage of the project. In
   this paper, the CO2 storage capacity in the H-59 block was calculated by
   considering various CO2 trapping mechanisms, and the distribution and
   trapping status of the stored CO2 were evaluated by using the reservoir
   simulation method. The effective CO2 storage capacity in the H-59 block
   is estimated to be 26.37 x 104 ton by incorporating the CO2 sweep
   efficiency and neglecting the mineral trapping. Up to June 2014, 21.08 x
   104 ton of CO2 has been injected with over 95\% stored. The geological
   structure of the H-59 block controls most of the injected CO2 moving
   only along the horizontal direction in the thin oil layers. The shape
   and size of the CO2 plume are mainly determined by the reservoir
   heterogeneity, well pattern and injected CO2 amount. According to the
   assessment results, the CO2 sweep efficiency within each well group
   varies from 20\% to 80\%. About 42.68-60.15\% of the stored CO2 has been
   trapped at supercritical state accompanied with 24.85-41.8\% and 15\% of
   the stored CO2 dissolved in residual oil and water, respectively. The
   H-59 block still has a potentially remaining capacity of 6.25 x 104 ton
   of CO2 for the future storage. Necessary engineering measures might be
   taken to further increase the sweep and displacement efficiencies of CO2
   to achieve this purpose. (C)2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During the operation of a geological carbon storage project, it is
   crucial to estimate the uncertainty in the flow characteristics of
   injected CO2. However, because a large suite of geological models are
   probable given sparse static data, it is impractical to conduct full
   physics flow simulations in the entire suite in order to quantify the
   uncertainty in CO2 plume migrations. We propose a fast connectivity
   based proxy that approximates a CO2 plume migration in a 3-dimensional
   heterogeneous reservoir during an injection period where viscous forces
   are dominant over capillary forces. The geological models are ranked
   based on the extent of the approximated CO2 plumes. By selecting a
   representative group of models among the ranked models, the uncertainty
   in the spatial and temporal characteristics of the CO2 plume migrations
   can be quickly quantified. We saved about 90\% of the computational cost
   of quantifying the uncertainty in the extent of CO2 plumes using the
   connectivity based proxy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{It is expected that a non-trivial percentage of small bodies that future
   missions may visit are in non-principal axis rotation (i.e.
   ``tumbling{''}). The primary contribution of this paper is the
   application of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Simultaneous
   Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method to estimate the small body spin
   state, mass, and moments of inertia; the spacecraft position and
   velocity; and the surface landmark locations. The method uses optical
   landmark measurements, and an example scenario based on the Rosetta
   mission is used. The SLAM method proves effective, with order of
   magnitude decreases in the spacecraft and small body spin state errors
   after less than a quarter of the comet characterization phase. The SLAM
   method converges nicely for initial small body angular velocity errors
   several times larger than the true rates (effectively having no a priori
   knowledge of the angular velocity). Surface landmark generation and
   identification are not treated in this work, but significant errors in
   the initial body-fixed landmark positions are effectively estimated. The
   algorithm remains effective for a range of different truth spin states,
   masses, and center of mass offsets that correspond to expected tumbling
   small bodies throughout the solar system.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of communication technologies, the main intelligence
   challenge has shifted from collecting data to efficiently processing it

   adversaries (eg terrorists) and benign participants. We propose a

   intercepted communications. Besides addressing a real and urgent problem
   that has attracted little attention in the open literature thus far, the
   main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we develop a novel
   knowledge accumulation model for intelligence processors, which
   addresses both the nodes of the social network (the participants) and
   its edges (the communications). Second, we propose efficient
   prioritization algorithms that utilize the processor's accumulated

Abstract = {{Pavement management systems rely on accurate distress measurements to
   support transportation agency officials in making decisions on budget
   planning and allocation as well as on the design of maintenance and
   rehabilitation strategies. Errors in distress data measurements lead to
   inappropriate project prioritization and increased maintenance and
   rehabilitation costs. This paper presents an independent evaluation of
   the accuracy and precision of high-speed field measurements of pavement
   cracking taken by three different automatic three-dimensional (3D)
   systems that represent the state of the practice. Cracking data were
   collected from a field experiment designed to represent typical
   conditions encountered in Texas highway network and comprised twenty
   550-ft pavement sections. Three vendors participated in the experiment;
   two of them used the same hardware (i.e., INO LCMS sensors) but
   different proprietary algorithms to detect and quantify surface
   distresses. The third vendor used PaveVision sensors. The high-speed
   measurements were compared to manual measurements taken statically by
   experienced certified raters. Further, each service provider was asked
   to report their results with different levels of manual intervention in
   order to capture the change in accuracy due to manual postprocessing of
   the data. The large number of false positives and low overall accuracy
   and precision showed by the three automated systems highlights the need
   for improvements on the available high-speed data collection
   technologies. The accuracy, along with the amount of false positives,
   significantly improved after applying manual postprocessing. The
   precision, on the other hand, was similar. In addition, a weak
   association between cracking measurement accuracy and surface texture
   was observed for every automated system. (C) 2016 American Society of

Abstract = {{Glass curtain-wall systems are extensively used in modern construction.
   They can be manufactured as building facades with high-efficiency
   properties prescribed by the designer; among these properties, the most
   important are high strength-to-self-weight ratio, serviceability
   requirements, recyclability of the constituent parts, as well as
   transparency and overall aesthetic characteristics. The structural
   performance of curtain-wall systems has to be meticulously analysed and
   designed to fulfil structural Eurocodes requirements because facades
   are, in most cases, subjected to strong environmental actions. In
   addition, as a second design step, by applying advanced finite-element
   analysis schemes and taking into account structural design criteria, an
   optimal structural design of the glass curtain-wall system has to be
   carried out to achieve cost minimisation once structural integrity and
   serviceability requirements have been fulfilled. The optimal structural
   design approach proposed in this paper leads to significant conclusions
   that can be used for the selection of mullions, transoms, anchoring
   details and glass panels with reference to the predominant environmental
   actions of wind and earthquake. The proposed methodology is illustrated
   by means of a numerical application to a typical building facade case

Journal = {{WIND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{261-269}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study describes a framework for estimation of structural damage to
   offshore wind plants during hurricanes. Related risk assessment is
   fundamentally dependent on the estimation of hurricane-generated wind
   speed exceedance probabilities at selected hub heights of wind turbines
   in the plant and on estimation of associated wind turbine loads. As part
   of a framework for risk assessment introduced here, synthetic storm
   tracks are first simulated over the ocean using available historical
   tropical storm data; then, a hurricane intensity evolution model based
   on thermodynamic and atmospheric environmental variables is developed
   for each simulated track as it approaches the chosen wind plant site.
   Based on this intensity model, a turbulent wind field can be simulated
   at any location of interest along the hurricane track. The simulated
   turbulent wind field can then be used to estimate wind speed exceedance
   probability distributions and, when combined with partially correlated
   waves, it can also be used in analyzing the response of individual
   turbines in a wind plant. A framework for the overall risk assessment is

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rock permeability has been actively investigated over the past several
   decades by the geosciences community. However, its accurate estimation
   still presents significant technical challenges, particularly in
   spatially complex rocks. In this short communication, we apply critical
   path analysis (CPA) to estimate permeability in porous rocks from
   measured mercury intrusion porosimetry and electrical conductivity data.
   Theoretical estimations of various CPA-based models are then compared to
   experimental measurements using eighteen tight-gas sandstones. Except
   for two of the samples, we find permeability estimations performed with
   the Skaggs model (assuming pore diameter independent of its length) more
   accurate than other models, within a factor of two of the measured
   permeabilities. We discuss some plausible sources of the uncertainties.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{647-657}},

Abstract = {{In matrix factorization problems, one seeks to decompose a data matrix
   into a product of two matrices-frequently, one captures meaningful
   information contained in the data, and the other specifies how this
   information is combined to generate the data matrix. In this paper,
   matrix factorization that arises in haplotype assembly, an important
   NP-hard problem in genomics, is studied. Haplotypes are sequences of
   chromosomal variations in an individual's genome, which are of critical
   importance for understudying the individual's susceptibility to various
   diseases. A novel formulation of haplotype assembly as the partially
   observed low-rank matrix factorization problem is proposed and
   efficiently solved via a modified gradient descent method that exploits
   salient structural properties of sequencing data. In particular, the
   observed matrix in the problem at hand contains noisy samples of the
   product of an informative matrix with rows having entries from a finite
   alphabet and a matrix with rows that are standard unit basis.
   Convergence of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and its performance
   tested on both synthetic and experimental data. The results demonstrate
   superior accuracy and speed of the proposed method as compared to
   state-of-the-art haplotype assembly techniques.}},

   density extracted from high resolution topography data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{537}},
Pages = {{271-282}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mark Melton in 1957 found that climate, basin morphometry, and surficial
   variables control drainage density (D-d), but differences observed
   between field surveyed channels and those mapped on topographic contours
   or blue lines left doubts on these results. Later, several landscape
   evolution model and observational studies analyzed the behavior of D-d.
   However, only a few studies have been performed over a large number of
   landscapes of different characteristics and have relied on high
   resolution topography data.
   We revisit Melton's hypothesis by using meter-resolution digital terrain
   models (DTMs) in 101 sub-basins in the USA. We first propose a
   dimensionless drainage density (D-dd) metric based on the ratio of
   likely channelized pixels to total number of basin pixels, which has the
   advantage of eliminating the computation of the channel network. Our
   analysis shows that D-dd is a weak scaling function of the input DTM
   resolution compared to the classic dimensional D-d metric (ratio of
   total channel length to total basin area). We analyze the correlation of
   D-dd and mean annual precipitation (MAP) with a Gaussian mixture model
   which identifies two sub-groups displaying different correlation;
   negative in arid and semi-arid environments, and positive in humid
   environments. The transition in correlation is around 1100 +/- 100 mm/yr
   of MAP and is accompanied by the occurrence of thick soil layers and
   high available water capacity that promote dense vegetation cover
   (V-cov) and low D-dd. While small variation in D-dd is observed across
   vegetation types, increasing V-cov corresponds to decreasing D-dd. We
   also explore the relationship between D-dd and relief R, and D-dd and
   lithology. D-dd and R are weakly correlated in arid and semiarid
   environments, while they have strong positive correlation in humid
   environments. No significant correlation is found between D-dd and
   lithology although the results are likely affected by our sample choice.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{177-187}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Ion exchange (IX) is the most common approach to treating
   nitrate-contaminated drinking water sources, but the cost of salt to
   make regeneration brine, as well as the cost and environmental burden of
   waste brine disposal, are major disadvantages. A hybrid ion
   exchange-catalyst treatment system, in which waste brine is
   catalytically treated for reuse, shows promise for reducing costs and
   environmental burdens of the conventional IX system. An IX model with
   separate treatment and regeneration cycles was developed, and ion
   selectivity coefficients for each cycle were separately calibrated by
   fitting experimental data. Of note, selectivity coefficients for the
   regeneration cycle required fitting the second treatment cycle after
   incomplete resin regeneration. The calibrated and validated model was
   used to simulate many cycles of treatment and regeneration using the
   hybrid system. Simulated waste brines and a real brine obtained from a
   California utility were also evaluated for catalytic nitrate treatment
   in a packed-bed, flow-through column with 0.5 wt\%Pd-0.05

   and no apparent catalyst deactivation were observed over 23 d (synthetic
   brine) and 45 d (real waste brine) of continuous-flow treatment. Ion
   exchange and catalyst results were used to evaluate treatment of 1
   billion gallons of nitrate-contaminated source water at a 0.5 MGD water
   treatment plant. Switching from a conventional IX system with a two bed
   volume regeneration to a hybrid system with the same regeneration length
   and sequencing batch catalytic reactor treatment would save 76\% in salt
   cost. The results suggest the hybrid system has the potential to address
   the disadvantages of a conventional IX treatment systems. (C) 2016

Title = {{A parallel and adaptive hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method for

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{304}},
Pages = {{118-139}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion equation in anisotropic and nonhomogeneous media arises in
   the study of flow through porous media with sharp material interfaces.
   We discuss the solution of this problem by a hybrid discontinuous
   Galerkin (HDG) method. The method can be applied in three steps. First,
   we use a condensation technique to derive the scalar variable and the
   flux inside each element in terms of the numerical trace on the faces of
   that element. Then we form a global system of equations to solve for
   these numerical traces. We then solve the equation inside each element
   for the internal unknowns using the obtained numerical traces in the
   global solve step. Similar to other DG variants, HDG is a locally
   conservative method, and a noticeable share of calculations are
   performed independently within each element. In a mesh with pth order
   elements (p >= 0), this method gives p + 1 order of accuracy for smooth
   solutions for both the scalar variable and the flux. Moreover, by using
   a simple post-processing technique, one can reach an accuracy of order p
   + 2 for the scalar variable. To be able to handle problems with sharp
   material discontinuities, we use an adaptive refinement strategy, with
   octree grid structure. Hence, we avoid a larger global system which
   would arise from a fine uniform grid. In this process, we refine those
   elements with highest gradient of flux, at two sides of their faces. We
   have also utilized shared and distributed memory parallelism to enhance
   the performance of the method. The method is implemented using different
   modules of deal. II (Bangerth and Kanschat, 1999), PETSc (Balay et al.,
   2015), p4est (Burstedde et al., 2011) and Hypre (Falgout and Yang,
   2002). To demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and
   flexibility of the method, several two and three dimensional numerical
   experiments are studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of engineering education research provides an opportunity
   for cross-fertilisation of ideas and creativity, but it also can result
   in fragmentation of the field and duplication of effort. One solution is
   to establish a standardised taxonomy of engineering education terms to
   map the field and communicate and connect research initiatives. This
   report describes the process for developing such a taxonomy, the EER
   Taxonomy. Although the taxonomy focuses on engineering education
   research in the United States, inclusive efforts have engaged 266
   individuals from 149 cities in 30 countries during one multiday
   workshop, 7 conference sessions, and several other virtual and in-person
   activities. The resulting taxonomy comprises 455 terms arranged in 14
   branches and 6 levels. This taxonomy was found to satisfy four criteria
   for validity and reliability: (1) keywords assigned to a set of
   abstracts were reproducible by multiple researchers, (2) the taxonomy
   comprised terms that could be selected as keywords to fully describe 243
   articles in 3 journals, (3) the keywords for those 243 articles were
   evenly distributed across the branches of the taxonomy, and (4) the
   authors of 31 conference papers agreed with 90\% of researcher-assigned
   keywords. This report also describes guidelines developed to help
   authors consistently assign keywords for their articles by encouraging
   them to choose terms from three categories: (1) context/focus/topic, (2)
   purpose/target/motivation, and (3) research approach.}},

Abstract = {{In large polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell stacks, monitoring
   and control of the local changes in membrane humidity inside the cathode
   channel is critical. In this study, a control-oriented dynamic model
   capable of describing the spatial distribution of voltage and relative
   humidity (RH) in a large fuel cell stack is developed and experimentally
   validated. The model tracks energy and mass flow inside the cathode,
   anode, and coolant channels, as well as the fuel cell stack body.
   Validation tests show that the model agrees well with the experimental
   data. The new modeling framework developed in this study can be used to
   predict the localized effects of humidity on the performance of a fuel
   cell stack. Also, given its accurate prediction of RH in the stack, this
   model can be used as an observer to predict local humidity variations
   that are, otherwise, not available. This capability would allow PEM fuel
   cells to avoid membrane damage due to low operating humidities as well
   as efficiency losses due to catalyst layer flooding.}},

   is popularly believed, when subjected to a high mixing intensity, the
   rheological properties of cement paste can increase once a certain
   threshold mixing intensity is achieved. This increase in rheological

Abstract = {{Beam theories have been extensively studied for applications in
   structural engineering. Space curved beams with large displacements,
   however, have been explored to a much less extent, not to mention
   explicit solutions concerning instabilities and critical loadings. In
   this paper, by carefully accounting for geometric nonlinearity and
   different scalings of kinematic variables, we present a variational
   framework for large-displacement space curved beams. We show that the
   variational formulation is consistent with the classic field equations,
   derive the appropriate boundary value problems for a variety of loading
   conditions and kinematic constraints, and generalize the Kirchhoff's
   helical solutions. Explicit planar solutions for semi-circular arches
   are obtained upon linearization. Further, two nonlinear asymptotic
   theories are proposed to address ribbon-like and moderately deformed
   curved beams, respectively. Based on the method of trial solutions, we
   obtain explicit approximate solutions to critical loadings for
   semi-circular arches losing stabilities due to twisting and out-of-plane
   displacement. The variational framework, nonlinear asymptotic theories,
   stability analysis and explicit solutions{''} are anticipated to have
   novel applications in stretchable electronics and biological

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{36-45}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the mechanisms and factors which impact foam
   flooding in tight formations. It focuses on oil/water miscible methods -
   titled `Low-Tension-Gas (LTG)' in this manuscript - for mobilizing and
   displacing the remaining crude oil after waterflood. This manuscript
   builds on previous work establishing Low-Tension-Gas (LTG) as an
   effective method for (oil to gas) sub-miscible tertiary recovery in
   tight sandstone and carbonate reservoirs (Szlendak et al., 2013). Such
   work determined that a high tertiary recovery of 75-90\% could be
   demonstrated with many of the same process attributes of Alkali
   Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) flooding but without many of the limitations
   associated with polymer application in tight formations.
   To better understand actual displacement phenomenon, where gas
   fractional flow can substantially vary, this paper presents two sets of
   data that empirically express LTG behavior. The first dataset was
   performed at differing (but constant) gas fractional flow
   (co-injection). Results show substantially higher oil recovery for
   floods with higher gas fractional flow (50\% and 85\%) during
   co-injection. The second dataset was performed at (cycle dependent)
   changing gas fractional flow (SAG). Comparison to co-injection results
   indicates that surfactant-alternating-gas (SAG) injection demonstrated
   improved displacement and overall recovery versus co-injection at the
   same overall average gas fractional flow (50\%). Finally, a mechanism
   for the displacement of in-situ fluids in tight formations during LTG
   injection is presented. It is based upon: the strong correlation between
   flood evolution and recovery attributes; and the high and consistent
   mobility reduction observed during extended liquid cycling in SAG
   injection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hard-carbon materials are considered as one of the most promising anodes
   for the emerging sodium-ion batteries. Here, we report a low-cost,
   scalable waste tire-derived carbon as an anode for sodium-ion batteries
   (SIBs). Tire-derived carbons obtained by pyrolyzing acid-treated tire at
   1100 degrees C, 1400 degrees C and 1600 degrees C show capacities of
   179,185 and 203 mAh g(-1), respectively, after 100 cycles at a current
   density of 20 mA g(-1) in sodium-ion batteries with good electrochemical
   stability. The portion of the low-voltage plateau region in the
   charge-discharge curves increases as the heat-treatment temperature
   increases. The low-voltage plateau is beneficial to enhance the energy
   density of the full cell. This study provides a new pathway for
   inexpensive, environmentally benign and value-added waste tire-derived
   products towards large-scale energy storage applications. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper describes the addition of spatially dependent power sharing
   to a methodology used for calculating the input and output isotopics and
   burnup of nuclear reactors within a nuclear fuel cycle simulator.
   Neutron balance and depletion calculations are carried out using
   pre-calculated fluence-based libraries. These libraries track the
   transmutation and neutron economy evolution of unit masses of nuclides
   available in input fuel. The work presented in the paper generalizes the
   method to simulate reactors that contain more than one type of fuel as
   well as strong spatial and flux heterogeneities, for instance breeders
   with a driver-blanket configuration. To achieve this, spatial flux
   calculations are used to determine the fluence-dependent relative
   average fluxes inside macroscopic spatial regions. These fluxes are then
   used to determine the average power of macroscopic spatial regions as
   well as to more accurately calculate region-specific transmutation
   rates. The paper presents several cases where the fluence based approach
   alone would not have been sufficient to determine results. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) test procedures use saturated
   concrete samples to (ostensibly) avoid the effect of moisture content.
   Concrete is a porous material, and internal water pressure develops in
   saturated concrete when subjected to temperature change due to the
   difference in CTE between liquid and solid phases. The measured CTE is
   affected by the internal water pressure development in saturated
   concrete samples. This paper represents an analytical model that was
   developed based on the poromechanical phenomenon of concrete to
   determine the time dependent internal water pressure and axial strain
   development. Material properties including, CTE, moduli of liquid and
   solid phase of concrete, as well as porosity and permeability of
   concrete samples have influence on the internal water pressure
   development. The predicted axial strain from the proposed numerical
   model for saturated concrete samples subjected to temperature changes
   were consistent with the experimental results. Predicted internal water
   pressure of the hardened concrete cylinder was as high as 700 psi (4.8
   MPa), which is sufficiently high to potentially induce microcracking.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the finite volume
   method (FVM) are coupled to solve transient conduction and radiation
   heat transfer problems. They are used to solve the energy equation and
   get the radiative heat source, respectively. To avoid additional
   interpolations between these two solvers when adding the radiative heat
   source to the energy equation, we propose to use the same grid systems
   for the LBM and FVM. This is achieved by adopting a half way bounce back
   boundary scheme for LBM. Good agreement with available literature is
   obtained for both 1D and 2D conditions. Effects of conduction-radiation
   parameter and scattering albedo on the transient temperature
   distribution are presented and discussed. The method proposed by this
   study is efficiently able to solve combined conduction and radiation

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{Parity-time symmetry has raised a great deal of attention in optics in
   recent years, yet its application has been so far hindered by the
   stringent requirements on coherent gain balanced with loss. In this
   paper, we show that the conditions to enable parity and time symmetry
   can be simultaneously satisfied for a pair of modes with mixed
   frequencies interacting in a nonlinear medium, without requiring the
   presence of material gain. First, we consider a guided wave structure
   with second order nonlinearity and we derive the PT-symmetric
   Hamiltonian that governs the interaction of two waves of mixed
   frequencies when accompanied by a high intensity pump beam at the sum
   frequency. We also extend the results to an array of coupled nonlinear
   waveguide channels. It is shown that the evolution dynamics of the
   low-frequency waves is associated with a periodic PT-symmetric lattice
   while the phase of the pump beams can be utilized as a control parameter
   to modify the gain and loss distribution, thus realizing different PT
   lattices by design. Our results suggest that nonlinear wave mixing
   processes can form a rich platform to realize PT-symmetric Hamiltonians
   of arbitrary dimensions in optical systems, without requiring material
   gain.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and study numerically a tunable and reconfigurable
   metamaterial based on coupled split-ring resonators (SRRs) and plasma
   discharges. The metamaterial couples the magnetic-electric response of
   the SRR structure with the electric response of a controllable plasma
   slab discharge that occupies a volume of the metamaterial. Because the
   electric response of a plasma depends on its constitutive parameters
   (electron density and collision frequency), the plasma-based
   metamaterial is tunable and active. Using three-dimensional numerical
   simulations, we analyze the coupled plasma-SRR metamaterial in terms of
   transmittance, performing parametric studies on the effects of electron
   density, collisional frequency, and the position of the plasma slab with
   respect to the SRR array. We find that the resonance frequency can be
   controlled by the plasma position or the plasma-to-collision frequency
   ratio, while transmittance is highly dependent on the latter. Published

Abstract = {{Tunable aliovalent doping is critical to controlling the optoelectronic
   properties of semiconductor nanocrystal systems. However, unintentional
   dopant-induced shape evolution and kinetically limited doping reactions
   in low temperature nanocrystal syntheses make it difficult to
   independently control shape and incorporate dopants in colloidal metal
   oxide nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy for
   achieving simultaneous control of both nanorod shape and dopant
   concentration in colloidal zinc oxide nanorods. We show that this
   approach succeeds in doping zinc oxide nanorods using Group III dopants
   (indium or aluminum) in varying concentrations, and we quantify the
   effects of dopant incorporation on the structural, optical, and
   plasmonic properties of the nanorods. The synthesis of undoped zinc
   oxide nanorod templates and subsequent addition of dopant salts to the
   ongoing reaction enables both shape retention and dopant incorporation.
   Subsequent growth of an undoped shell on the nanorods incorporates
   surface segregated dopants with high efficiency. This ``core/shell{''}
   doping strategy presents a general route to achieving controlled dopant
   incorporation and morphological retention in anisotropic metal oxide
   nanocrystal systems.}},

Abstract = {{We present the optimized design of an antireflection coating to
   efficiently couple an incident plane wave into a metamaterial with a
   complex field profile. We show that such an antireflection coating must
   enable spatial engineering of the field profiles at the
   coating/metamaterial interface to achieve high transmission, and
   therefore it is required to be inhomogeneous. As a demonstration, we
   investigate theoretically a waveguide-based negative-index metamaterial,
   which under normal incidence cannot be excited due to the antisymmetric
   propagating eigenmode. Through careful engineering of the field profile,
   lateral position, and thickness of the coating layer, we enhance the
   transmission under normal incidence from 0\% to 100\%. This principle
   may generally be applied to overcome low coupling efficiency between
   incident plane waves and complex mode profiles in metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and
   clinical implications of leaks (acute incomplete occlusion, early and
   late reopenings) following LAA ligation with the LARIAT device.
   BACKGROUND Percutaneous LAA ligation with the LARIAT device may
   represent an alternative for stroke prevention in high-risk patients
   with atrial fibrillation with contraindications to oral anticoagulation.
   METHODS This was a retrospective, multicenter study of 98 consecutive
   patients undergoing successful LAA ligation with the LARIAT device.
   Leaks were defined as the presence of flow as evaluated by
   transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). TEE was performed during the
   procedure, at 6 and 12 months, and after thromboembolic events.
   RESULTS Leaks were detected in 5 (5\%), 14 (15\%), and 19 (20\%)
   patients at the 3 time points. During follow-up, 5 patients developed
   neurological events (4 strokes and 1 transient ischemic attack). Two
   occurred early (1 fatal stroke and 1 stroke with multiple recurrences in
   the following months), and TEE was not repeated after the events. The
   remaining 3 occurred late (after 6 months) and were associated with
   small leaks (<5 mm). In 2 of 3 cases, such a small leak was missed by
   the standard evaluation on 2-dimensional TEE, being evident only with
   the aid of 3-dimensional imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS Incomplete occlusion of the LAA after LARIAT ligation is
   relatively common and may be associated with thromboembolic events.
   Proper long-term surveillance with careful TEE should be considered to
   detect leaks, which can be managed with either resumption of oral
   anticoagulation or percutaneous transcatheter closure. (C) 2016 by the

Abstract = {{We extend our assessment of the potential of perturbative coupled
   cluster (CC) expansions for a test set of open-shell atoms and organic
   radicals to the description of quadruple excitations. Namely, the
   second-through sixth-order models of the recently proposed CCSDT(Q-n)
   quadruples series {[}J. J. Eriksen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108
   (2014)] are compared to the prominent CCSDT(Q) and.CCSDT(Q) models. From
   a comparison of the models in terms of their recovery of total CC
   singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples (CCSDTQ) energies, we find
   that the performance of the CCSDT(Q-n) models is independent of the
   reference used (unrestricted or restricted (open-shell) Hartree-Fock),
   in contrast to the CCSDT(Q) and.CCSDT(Q) models, for which the accuracy
   is strongly dependent on the spin of the molecular ground state. By
   further comparing the ability of the models to recover relative CCSDTQ
   total atomization energies, the discrepancy between them is found to be
   even more pronounced, stressing how a balanced description of both
   closed-and open-shell species-as found in the CCSDT(Q-n) models-is
   indeed of paramount importance if any perturbative CC model is to be of
   chemical relevance for high-accuracy applications. In particular, the
   third-order CCSDT(Q-3) model is found to offer an encouraging
   alternative to the existing choices of quadruples models used in modern
   computational thermochemistry, since the model is still only of moderate
   cost, albeit markedly more costly than, e.g., the CCSDT(Q) and.CCSDT(Q)
   models. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy at which total energies of open-shell atoms and organic
   radicals may be calculated is assessed for selected coupled cluster
   perturbative triples expansions, all of which augment the coupled
   cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) energy by a non-iterative correction
   for the effect of triple excitations. Namely, the second-through
   sixth-order models of the recently proposed CCSD(T-n) triples series {[}
   J. J. Eriksen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108 (2014)] are compared to
   the acclaimed CCSD(T) model for both unrestricted as well as restricted
   open-shell Hartree-Fock (UHF/ROHF) reference determinants. By comparing
   UHF- and ROHF-based statistical results for a test set of 18
   modest-sized open-shell species with comparable RHF-based results, no
   behavioral differences are observed for the higher-order models of the
   CCSD(T-n) series in their correlated descriptions of closed-and
   open-shell species. In particular, we find that the convergence rate
   throughout the series towards the coupled cluster singles, doubles, and
   triples (CCSDT) solution is identical for the two cases. For the CCSD(T)
   model, on the other hand, not only its numerical consistency, but also
   its established, yet fortuitous cancellation of errors breaks down in
   the transition from closed-to open-shell systems. The higher-order
   CCSD(T-n) models (orders n > 3) thus offer a consistent and significant
   improvement in accuracy relative to CCSDT over the CCSD(T) model,
   equally for RHF, UHF, and ROHF reference determinants, albeit at an
   increased computational cost. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We use a real-space implementation of pseudopotentials within the
   density functional theory to investigate the structural and magnetic
   properties of cobalt clusters with up to 365 atoms. We find from
   structural optimization that hcp and icosahedral clusters are lower in
   energy than bcc and fcc clusters. The calculated magnetic moments
   generally decrease as a function of increasing cluster size. For
   clusters of several hundred atoms the bulk limit becomes apparent.
   However, the decrease is not monotonic. It depends on the details of the
   interior structure of the cluster and the corresponding surface
   geometry. By analyzing the detailed evolution of the local magnetic
   moment, we find the spin moment is bulklike in the cluster interior and
   increases in the vicinity of the surface and can be correlated with
   coordination. The calculated behavior accounts for the observed
   variations in the measured moments.}},

Abstract = {{Implantable electronic devices for recording electrophysiological
   signals and for stimulating muscles and nerves have been widely used
   throughout clinical medicine. Mechanical mismatch between conventional
   rigid biomedical devices and soft curvilinear tissues, however, has
   frequently resulted in a low signal to noise ratio and/or mechanical
   fatigue and scarring. Multi-functionality ranging from various sensing
   modalities to therapeutic functions is another important goal for
   implantable biomedical devices. Here, a stretchable and transparent
   medical device using a cell-sheet-graphene hybrid is reported, which can
   be implanted to form a high quality biotic/abiotic interface. The hybrid
   is composed of a sheet of C2C12 myoblasts on buckled, mesh-patterned
   graphene electrodes. The graphene electrodes monitor and actuate the
   C2C12 myoblasts in vitro, serving as a smart cell culture substrate that
   controls their aligned proliferation and differentiation. This
   stretchable and transparent cell-sheet-graphene hybrid can be
   transplanted onto the target muscle tissue, to record
   electromyographical signals, and stimulate implanted sites electrically
   and/or optically in vivo. Additional cellular therapeutic effect of the
   cell-sheet-graphene hybrid is obtained by integrated myobalst cell
   sheets. Any immune responses within implanted muscle tissues are not
   observed. This multifunctional device provides many new opportunities in
   the emerging field of soft bioelectronics.}},

Title = {{Thermal and thermoelectric transport measurements of an individual boron
   arsenide microstructure}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{Recent first principles calculations have predicted that boron arsenide
   (BAs) can possess an unexpectedly high thermal conductivity that depends
   sensitively on the crystal size and defect concentration. However, few
   experimental results have been obtained to verify these predictions. In
   the present work, we report four-probe thermal and thermoelectric
   transport measurements of an individual BAs microstructure that was
   synthesized via a vapor transport method. The measured thermal
   conductivity was found to decrease slightly with temperature in the
   range between 250 K and 350 K. The temperature dependence suggests that
   the extrinsic phonon scattering processes play an important role in
   addition to intrinsic phonon-phonon scattering. The room temperature
   value of (186 +/- 46) Wm(-1) K-1 is higher than that of bulk silicon but
   still a factor of four lower than the calculated result for a
   defect-free, non-degenerate BAs rod with a similar diameter of 1.15 mu
   m. The measured p-type Seebeck coefficient and thermoelectric power
   factor are comparable to those of bismuth telluride, which is a commonly
   used thermoelectric material. The foregoing results also suggest that it
   is necessary to not only reduce defect and boundary scatterings but also
   to better understand and control the electron scattering of phonons in
   order to achieve the predicted ultrahigh intrinsic lattice thermal
   conductivity of BAs. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Adsorptive-mechanical properties of reconstituted granular coal:
   Experimental characterization and poromechanical modeling}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{158-168}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The understanding of transport and mechanical processes in rocks with a
   tight matrix, such as coal, is important to assess unconventional
   hydrocarbon-bearing geological formations. Whenever coal cores cannot be
   recovered to be studied in the laboratory, reconstituted coal samples
   from crushed granular coal can help estimate the coal matrix transport
   and adsorptive-mechanical properties. In fact, the use of crushed
   granular coal is advantageous to measure coal adsorption isotherms
   quickly. Yet, reconstituted coal specimens have an intergranular
   porosity system and a mechanical behavior that significantly differ from
   the in-situ coal seam. We apply a double porosity poromechanical model
   that captures the influence of the coal matrix adsorptive-mechanical
   properties on the overall response of reconstituted granular coal
   specimens. Two laboratory examples provide evidence for (1)
   adsorption-induced swelling stress during constrained CO2 adsorption and
   (2) desorption upon mechanical loading at constant CO2 pressure. Results
   show that the magnitude of adsorption-mechanical couplings in
   reconstituted granular coal specimens is extremely sensitive to the
   compaction of the granular specimen. High initial compaction, high
   effective stress during testing, and relatively low fluid pressure
   facilitate identifying the impact of the coal matrix adsorption and
   swelling on the overall specimen response. Yet, creep and elastic
   nonlinearities may hinder sorption-induced strains and stresses. Well
   designed experiments and application of a double porosity model are
   critical to obtain a robust interpretation and understanding of the
   adsorptive mechanical properties of reconstituted granular coal.
   Conclusions from our findings, however, discourage the use of
   reconstituted granular coal to quantify swelling strains and stresses
   and their potential impact on reservoir permeability. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Phase behavior and interfacial properties of a switchable ethoxylated
   amine surfactant at high temperature and effects on CO2-in-water foams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{470}},
Pages = {{80-91}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The interfacial properties for surfactants at the supercritical
   CO2-water (C-W) interface at temperatures above 80 degrees C have very
   rarely been reported given limitations in surfactant solubility and
   chemical stability. These limitations, along with the weak solvent
   strength of CO2, make it challenging to design surfactants that adsorb
   at the C-W interface, despite the interest in CO2-in-water (C/W) foams
   (also referred to as macroemulsions). Herein, we examine the
   thermodynamic, interfacial and rheological properties of the surfactant
   C12-14N(EO)(2) in systems containing brine and/or supercritical CO2 at
   elevated temperatures and pressures. Because the surfactant is
   switchable from the nonionic state to the protonated cationic state as
   the pH is lowered over a wide range in temperature, it is readily
   soluble in brine in the cationic state below pH 5.5, even up to 120
   degrees C, and also in supercritical CO2 in the nonionic state. As a
   consequence of the affinity for both phases, the surfactant adsorption
   at the CO2-water interface was high, with an area of 207
   angstrom(2)/molecule. Remarkably, the surfactant lowered the interfacial
   tension (IFT) down to similar to 5 mN/m at 120 degrees C and 3400 psia
   (23 MPa), despite the low CO2 density of 0.48 g/ml, indicating
   sufficient solvation of the surfactant tails. The phase behavior and
   interfacial properties of the surfactant in the cationic form were
   favorable for the formation and stabilization of bulk C/W foam at high
   temperature and high salinity. Additionally, in a 1.2 Darcy glass bead
   pack at 120 degrees C, a very high foam apparent viscosity of 146 cP was
   observed at low interstitial velocities given the low degree of shear
   thinning. For a calcium carbonate pack, C/W foam was formed upon
   addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the feed brine to keep the pH below 4, by
   the common ion effect, in order to sufficiently protonate the
   surfactant. The ability to form C/W foams at high temperatures is of
   interest for a variety of applications in chemical synthesis,
   separations, materials science, and subsurface energy production. (C)

   sequenced the paired heavy-and light-chain variable regions (VH and VL,

   computational modeling of antibody structures to evaluate sequence and
   structural features of human antibody repertoires at unprecedented
   depth. Analysis of a dataset comprising 55,000 antibody clusters from

   CD19(+)CD20(+)CD27(+) antigen-experienced B cells, and >2,000
   RosettaAntibody-predicted structural models across three healthy donors
   led to a number of key findings: (i) VH and VL gene sequences pair in a
   combinatorial fashion without detectable pairing restrictions at the
   population level; (ii) certain VH: VL gene pairs were significantly
   enriched or depleted in the antigen-experienced repertoire relative to
   the naive repertoire; (iii) antigen selection increased antibody
   paratope net charge and solvent-accessible surface area; and (iv) public
   heavy-chain third complementarity-determining region (CDR-H3) antibodies
   in the antigen-experienced repertoire showed signs of convergent paired
   light-chain genetic signatures, including shared light-chain third
   complementarity-determining region (CDR-L3) amino acid sequences and/or
   V kappa,lambda-J kappa,lambda genes. The data reported here address
   several longstanding questions regarding antibody repertoire selection

Title = {{Chemical-sensitive graphene modulator with a memory effect for

Journal = {{MICROSYSTEMS \& NANOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Modern internet of things (IoTs) and ubiquitous sensor networks could
   potentially take advantage of chemically sensitive nanomaterials and
   nanostructures. However, their heterogeneous integration with other
   electronic modules on a networked sensor node, such as silicon-based
   modulators and memories, is inherently challenging because of
   compatibility and integration issues. Here we report a novel paradigm
   for sensing modulators: a graphene field-effect transistor device that
   directly modulates a radio frequency (RF) electrical carrier signal when
   exposed to chemical agents, with a memory effect in its electrochemical
   history. We demonstrated the concept and implementation of this
   graphene-based sensing modulator through a frequency-modulation (FM)
   experiment conducted in a modulation cycle consisting of alternating
   phases of air exposure and ethanol or water treatment. In addition, we
   observed an analog memory effect in terms of the charge neutrality point
   of the graphene, V-cnp, which strongly influences the FM results, and
   developed a calibration method using electrochemical gate-voltage pulse
   sequences. This graphene-based multifunctional device shows great
   potential for use in a simple, low-cost, and ultracompact
   nanomaterial-based nodal architecture to enable continuous, real-time
   event-based monitoring in pervasive healthcare IoTs, ubiquitous security
   systems, and other chemical/molecular/gas monitoring applications.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies have reported
   distinct features in regions with little electron density for various
   organic systems. These unexpected features have been proposed to be a
   direct visualization of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Here, we apply
   a computational method using ab initio real-space pseudopotentials along
   with a scheme to account for tip tilting to simulate AFM images of the
   8-hydroxyquinoline dimer and related systems to develop an understanding
   of the imaging mechanism for hydrogen bonds. We find that contrast for
   the observed ``hydrogen bond{''} feature comes not from the
   electrostatic character of the bonds themselves but rather from
   repulsive tip tilting induced by neighboring electron-rich atoms.

Abstract = {{Ozone (O-3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are valence isoelectronic species,
   yet their properties and reactivities differ dramatically. In
   particular, O-3 is highly reactive, whereas SO2 is chemically relatively
   stable. In this paper, we investigate serial addition of hydrogen atoms
   to both the terminal atoms of O-3 and SO2 and to the central atom of
   these species. It is well-known that the terminal atoms of O-3 are much
   more amenable to bond formation than those of SO2. We show that the
   differences in the electronic structure of the pi systems in the parent
   triatomic species account for the differences in the addition of
   hydrogen atoms to the terminal atoms of O-3 and SO2. Further, we find
   that the pi system in SO2, which is a recoupled pair bond dyad,
   facilitates the addition of hydrogen atoms to the sulfur atom, resulting
   in stable HSO2 and H2SO2 species.}},

Title = {{Geometrical tuning art for entirely subwavelength grating waveguide
   based integrated photonics circuits}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{Subwavelength grating (SWG) waveguide is an intriguing alternative to
   conventional optical waveguides due to the extra degree of freedom it
   offers in tuning a few important waveguide properties, such as
   dispersion and refractive index. Devices based on SWG waveguides have
   demonstrated impressive performances compared to conventional
   waveguides. However, the high loss of SWG waveguide bends jeopardizes
   their applications in integrated photonic circuits. In this work, we
   propose a geometrical tuning art, which realizes a pre-distorted
   refractive index profile in SWG waveguide bends. The pre-distorted
   refractive index profile can effectively reduce the mode mismatch and
   radiation loss simultaneously, thus significantly reduce the bend loss.
   This geometry tuning art has been numerically optimized and
   experimentally demonstrated in present study. Through such tuning, the
   average insertion loss of a 5 mu m SWG waveguide bend is reduced
   drastically from 5.43 dB to 1.10 dB per 90 degrees bend for quasi-TE
   polarization. In the future, the proposed scheme will be utilized to
   enhance performance of a wide range of SWG waveguide based photonics
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) are versatile
   inorganic-organic hybrid building blocks that have potential
   applications as reinforcement nanofillers, thermal stabilizers, and
   catalyst supports for metal nano particles. However, fabrication of
   fibrous materials with high POSS content has been a challenge because of
   the aggregation and solubility limits of POSS units. In this paper, we
   describe a robust and environmentally friendly fabrication approach of
   inorganic-organic hybrid POSS fibers by integrating UV initiated
   thiol-ene polymerization and centrifugal fiber spinning. The use of
   monomeric liquids in this approach not only reduces the consumption of
   heat energy and solvent, but it also promotes homogeneous mixing of
   organic and inorganic components that allows integration of large amount
   of POSS (up to 80 wt \%) into the polymer network. The POSS containing
   thiol-ene fibers exhibited enhanced thermomechanical properties compared
   to purely organic analogs as revealed by substantial increases in
   residual weight and a factor of 4 increase in modulus after thermal
   treatment at 1000 degrees C. This simple fabrication approach combined
   with the tunability in fiber properties afforded by tailoring monomer
   composition make POSS containing thiol-ene fibers attractive candidates
   for catalyst supports and filtration media, particularly in
   high-temperature and harsh environments.}},

Title = {{Extraordinary wavelength reduction in terahertz graphene-cladded
   photonic crystal slabs}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Photonic crystal slabs have been widely used in nanophotonics for light
   confinement, dispersion engineering, nonlinearity enhancement, and other
   unusual effects arising from their structural periodicity. Sub-micron
   device sizes and mode volumes are routine for silicon-based photonic
   crystal slabs, however spectrally they are limited to operate in the
   near infrared. Here, we show that two single-layer graphene sheets allow
   silicon photonic crystal slabs with submicron periodicity to operate in
   the terahertz regime, with an extreme 100x wavelength reduction from
   graphene's large kinetic inductance. The atomically thin graphene
   further leads to excellent out-of-plane confinement, and consequently
   photonic-crystal-slab band structures that closely resemble those of
   ideal two-dimensional photonic crystals, with broad band gaps even when
   the slab thickness approaches zero. The overall photonic band structure
   not only scales with the graphene Fermi level, but more importantly
   scales to lower frequencies with reduced slab thickness. Just like ideal
   2D photonic crystals, graphene-cladded photonic crystal slabs confine
   light along line defects, forming waveguides with the propagation
   lengths on the order of tens of lattice constants. The proposed
   structure opens up the possibility to dramatically reduce the size of
   terahertz photonic systems by orders of magnitude.}},

   electromagnetic waves in the few-THz regime on nanoscale graphene and
   copper transmission lines. Conventionally, such propagation has been
   considered to be highly dispersive, due to the RC time constant-driven
   voltage diffusion below 1 THz and plasmonic effects at higher optical
   frequencies. Our numerical modeling across the microwave, THz, and
   optical frequency ranges reveals that the conductor kinetic inductance
   creates an ultra-broadband linear-dispersion and constant-attenuation
   region in the THz regime. This so-called LC region is an ideal
   characteristic that is known to be absent in macro-scale transmission
   lines. The kinetic-LC frequency range is dictated by the structural
   dimensionality and the free-carrier scattering rate of the conductor
   material. Moreover, up to 40x wavelength reduction is observed in
   graphene transmission lines.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of prestress loss is required for design and analysis of
   prestressed concrete bridges and buildings. A proper balance must be
   struck between accuracy, precision, and conservatism for prestress loss
   estimation in order to safely and efficiently design prestressed
   concrete members. An extensive research project was undertaken in which
   30 full-scale bridge girders with a variety of applicable design
   parameters were instrumented, constructed, monitored, and tested; a
   comprehensive experimental database containing data from 140 full-scale
   bridge girders was assembled; and an extensive analytical program was
   conducted to investigate the sensitivity of current estimation methods
   and implications of loss estimation on final designs. Through the work
   of this project, a prestress loss estimation procedure was developed
   that is simple to use, precise, and offers an appropriate level of
   conservatism. This procedure can be used for both time-dependent and
   final prestress loss estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable rock classification is the key to identify target zones for
   successful hydraulic fracturing stimulation treatment in unconventional
   reservoirs such as organic-rich mudrocks. Such a rock classification
   scheme should take into account geologic attributes, petrophysical, and
   geomechanical properties (i.e., in situ stress gradient and elastic
   properties) to improve the likelihood of successful fracture treatment.
   However, conventional rock classification methods do not take into
   account stress gradients in the formation. We have developed a new rock
   classification technique that integrates four rock classification
   schemes based on the (1) geologic facies, (2) reservoir quality, (3)
   stress profile, and (4) completion quality. The techniques applied in
   these classification schemes include core description and thin section
   analysis, well-log-based depth-by-depth petrophysical and compositional
   characterization, and analysis of geomechanical measurements.
   Geomechanical analysis of core measurements and well logs provide a
   depth-by-depth assessment of minimum horizontal stress assuming vertical
   transverse isotropy in the formation. We have performed the geologic
   facies and reservoir quality classifications using an artificial neural
   network analysis, in which well logs and well-log-based estimates of the
   petrophysical and compositional properties were inputs to the network.
   Our technique was applied to a well located in the Wolfcamp Shale in the
   Delaware Basin. Based on the integrated rock classification results, we
   recommend the middle of the upper Wolfcamp and the bottom of the lower
   Wolfcamp depth intervals as the best candidates for fracture initiation
   and fracture containment zones, respectively. The selection of these
   zones was based on the reservoir quality and average minimum horizontal
   stress gradient calculated in these intervals. Our integrated rock
   classification technique can improve the planning and execution of
   completions design for hydraulic fracture treatments.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Neutron logs are routinely expressed as apparent neutron porosity based
   on the assumption of a freshwater-saturated homogeneous formation with
   solid composition equal to either sandstone, limestone, or dolomite.
   Rock formations are often extremely heterogeneous and consist of
   different minerals and fluids in varying proportions, which cause
   simultaneous matrix and fluid effects on neutron logs. Detailed
   quantification of formation mineral composition enables the correction
   of matrix effects on measured neutron logs to unmask fluid effects; this
   in turn enables accurate quantification of porosity and water
   saturation. Neutron-induced gamma-ray spectroscopy is one of the most
   direct means available to quantify in situ formation mineralogy but
   available spectroscopy-based interpretation methods are usually tool
   dependent and incorporate empirical correlations. We have developed a
   new interpretation method to quantify mineral concentrations through the
   joint nonlinear matrix inversion of measured spectroscopy elemental
   weight concentrations and matrix-sensitive logs, such as gamma ray,
   matrix photoelectric factor, matrix sigma (neutron capture cross
   section), and matrix density. The estimated mineralogy was used in the
   correction of matrix effects on porosity logs and subsequent calculation
   of true formation porosity. The water saturation was quantified through
   joint petrophysical interpretation of matrix-corrected porosities and
   resistivity measurements using an appropriate saturation model. The
   developed inversion-based interpretation method is applicable to a wide
   range of formation lithologies, well trajectories, and borehole
   environments (including open and cased hole environments), and it is
   independent of tool and neutron source type. Verification results with
   synthetic and field cases confirm that the spectroscopy-based algorithm
   is reliable and accurate in the quantification of mineral
   concentrations, matrix properties, porosity, and hydrocarbon saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonate formations consist of a wide range of pore types with
   different shapes, pore-throat sizes, and varying levels of pore-network
   connectivity. Such heterogeneous pore-network properties affect the
   fluid flow in the formation. However, characterizing pore-network
   properties (e.g., effective porosity and permeability) in carbonate
   formations is challenging due to the heterogeneity at different scales
   and complex pore structure of carbonate rocks. We have developed an
   integrated technique for multiscale characterization of carbonate pore
   structure based on mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP)
   measurements, X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) 3D rock images,
   and well logs. We have determined pore types based on the pore-throat
   radius distributions obtained from MICP measurements. We developed a new
   method for improved assessment of effective porosity and permeability in
   the well-log domain using pore-scale numerical simulations of fluid flow
   and electric current flow in 3D micro-CT core images obtained in each
   pore type. Finally, we conducted petrophysical rock classification based
   on the depth-by-depth estimates of effective porosity, permeability,
   volumetric concentrations of minerals, and pore types using an
   unsupervised artificial neural network. We have successfully applied the
   proposed technique to three wells in the Scurry Area Canyon Reef
   Operators Committee (SACROC) Unit. Our results find that electrical
   resistivity measurements can be used for reliable characterization of
   pore structure and assessment of effective porosity and permeability in
   carbonate formations. The estimates of permeability in the well-log
   domain were cross-validated using the available core measurements. We
   have observed a 34\% improvement in relative errors in well-log-based
   estimates of permeability, as compared with the core-based
   porosity-permeability models.}},

Abstract = {{Rock typing is critical in deepwater reservoir characterization to
   construct stratigraphic models populated with static and dynamic
   petrophysical properties. Rock typing based on multiple well logs is
   subject to large uncertainty in thinly bedded reservoirs because true
   physical properties cannot be resolved by low-resolution logging tools
   due to shoulder-bed effects. We have introduced a new Bayesian approach
   that inherently adopts the scientific method of iterative hypothesis
   testing to perform rock typing by simultaneously honoring different
   logging-tool physics in a multilayered earth model. In addition to
   estimating the vertical distribution of rock types with maximum
   likelihood, the Bayesian method quantifies the uncertainty of rock types
   and the associated petrophysical properties layer by layer. Bayesian
   rock classification is performed with a fast sampling technique based on
   the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method, thereby enabling an efficient
   search of rock types to obtain the final results. We have used a fast
   linear iterative refinement method to simulate nuclear logs and a 2D
   forward modeling code to simulate array-induction resistivity logs. A
   rock-type distribution hypothesis is considered acceptable only when all
   the observed well logs are reproduced with forward modeling. In a field
   case of offshore deltaic gas reservoir, the Bayesian method
   differentiates rock types that exhibit subtle petrophysical variations
   due to grain size change. The new method provides more than 77\%
   agreement between log-and corederived rock types, whereas conventional
   deterministic methods achieve only 60\% agreement due to the presence of
   thin beds and laminations. Even though large uncertainty is observed in
   thinly bedded and laminated zones, the Bayesian rock-typing method still
   yields rock types and petrophysical properties that agree well with
   core-plug measurements acquired in these layers. As a result, the
   overall correlation between log-derived permeability and core-measured
   permeability is improved by approximately 16\% when compared with
   conventional deterministic methods.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear magnetic resonance has been applied in well logging to
   investigate pore size distribution with high resolution and accuracy
   based on the relaxation time distribution. However, due to the
   heterogeneity of natural rock, pore surface relaxivity, which links
   relaxation time and pore size, varies within the pore system. To analyze
   and alter pore surface relaxivity, we saturated Boise sandstone cores
   with positively charged zirconia nanoparticle dispersions in which
   nanoparticles can be adsorbed onto the sandstone pore wall, while
   negatively charged zirconia nanoparticles dispersions were used as a
   control group to provide the baseline of nanoparticle retention due to
   nonelectrostatic attraction. We have performed core flushing with
   deionized water, pure acid, and alkali with different pH values;
   compared properties of zirconia nanoparticles before and after exposure
   to Boise sandstone; analyzed the portion of zirconia nanoparticles
   retained in the rock; altered pore surface relaxivity; and linked the
   adsorbed nanoparticle concentration on the pore surface to the modified
   surface relaxivity. Our work has indicated that after two pore volumes
   of core flooding, there was approximately 1\% of negatively charged
   nanoparticles trapped in the Boise sandstone core, whereas approximately
   8\%-11\% of positively charged nanoparticles was retained in the Boise
   sandstone cores. Our results indicated that besides van der Waals
   attraction, electrostatic attraction was the driving force for retention
   of nanoparticles with a positive surface charge in sandstone cores. The
   attachment of nanoparticles onto sandstone surfaces changed the mineral
   surface relaxivity. Exposure to acidic or strong alkaline conditions
   increased the Boise sandstone surface relaxivity. After contact with
   Boise sandstone, the nanoparticles themselves exhibited increased
   relaxivity due to interactions between nanoparticles dispersion and
   mineral surface under different pH conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon production from mudrock or shale reservoirs typically
   exceeds estimates based on mudrock laboratory permeability measurements,
   with the difference attributed to natural fractures. However, natural
   fractures in these reservoirs are frequently completely cemented and
   thus assumed not to contribute to flow. We quantify the permeability of
   nanoscale grain boundary channels with mean apertures of 50-130 nm in
   otherwise completely cemented natural fractures of the Eagle Ford
   Formation and estimate their contribution to production. Using scanning
   electron imaging of grain boundary channel network geometry and a
   digital rock physics workflow of image reconstruction and direct flow
   modeling, we estimate cement permeability to be 38-750 nd, higher than
   reported permeability of Eagle Ford host rock (similar to 2 nd) based on
   laboratory measurements. Our results suggest that effective
   fracture-parallel mudrock permeability can exceed laboratory values by
   upward of 1 order of magnitude in shale reservoirs of high macroscopic
   cemented fracture volume fraction.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies allow fast and affordable
   sequencing of individual genomes and thus enable unprecedented studies
   of genetic variations. Information about variations in the genome of an
   individual is provided by haplotypes, ordered collections of single
   nucleotide polymorphisms. Knowledge of haplotypes is instrumental in
   finding genes associated with diseases, drug development, and
   evolutionary studies. Haplotype assembly from high-throughput sequencing
   data is challenging due to errors and limited lengths of sequencing
   reads. The key observation made in this paper is that the minimum
   error-correction formulation of the haplotype assembly problem is
   identical to the task of deciphering a coded message received over a
   noisy channel-a classical problem in the mature field of communication
   theory. Exploiting this connection, we develop novel haplotype assembly
   schemes that rely on the bit-flipping and belief propagation algorithms
   often used in communication systems. The latter algorithm is then
   adapted to the haplotype assembly of polyploids. We demonstrate on both
   simulated and experimental data that the proposed algorithms compare
   favorably with state-of-the-art haplotype assembly methods in terms of
   accuracy, while being scalable and computationally efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging nanoscale applications in energy, electronics, and medicine
   require high throughput patterning with complex shape control at the
   nanoscale that is beyond the capabilities of optical lithography and
   block copolymer-based self-assembly. We introduce a technique for
   creating precise two-dimensional nanoshapes with sharp corners by
   imprint lithography, and apply it to enable shaped silicon nanowire
   capacitors that significantly exceed standard nanowire capacitor
   performance due to relative increase in surface area per unit projected
   area. The patterning technique employs atomic layer deposition to
   fabricate a template with diamond-like shapes consisting of corners with
   2 nm radii of curvature. Template materials and chemical staining of the
   imprint polymer enable precise imaging of the template and replicated
   resist. Continuum mechanics appears no longer applicable at the length
   scale of similar to 3 nm. A systematic increase in the radius of the
   imprinted corner is observed contrary to predictions by a linear elastic
   continuum model shedding new light on shape relaxation of polymers, and
   on the limits of nanoshape replicability by imprint lithography. Novel
   diamond-shaped silicon nanowires (100-nm half-pitch) have been
   fabricated using nanoshape imprint followed by metal-assisted chemical
   etching, and have been incorporated into shaped nanowire capacitors that
   exceed standard nanowire capacitors performance by similar to 90\%. The
   3-nm resolution limit does not degrade the performance of the shaped
   capacitor. This increased capacitance validates the ability to preserve
   nanoshape cross section during patterning and deep etching over large
   areas. Lithographic scaling to 10-nm half-pitch has the potential to
   further increase capacitance by a factor of 10.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been explored as an alternative to
   graphene as an electrode material for use in supercapacitors, which thus
   enables highly scalable solution-based processing. To understand the
   performance of rGO electrodes in supercapacitors, we theoretically
   investigate model systems by considering OH-functionalized graphene
   immersed in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
   (EMIM/FSI) ionic liquid. Our specific interest is to understand the
   influence of varying the hydroxyl content (or O/C ratio) on both the
   quantum (C-Q) and electric double-layer (C-D) capacitances. Ultimately,
   the total interfacial capacitance is found to be sensitive to O/C, but
   is optimized when the suppression of C-D is most effectively mitigated
   by the enhancement in C-Q. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the use
   of GO materials has the potential to enhance supercapacitor performance
   significantly but will require careful control of both the concentration
   and composition of oxygen functional groups along the basal surface.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the use of ammonia to inhibit the growth of
   previously nucleated ruthenium islands and force the nucleation of
   additional islands such that thinner films form as the islands coalesce
   with continued growth. Ruthenium films are grown at 448K in a chemical
   vapor deposition process on SiO2/Si(001) using triruthenium
   dodecacarbonyl, Ru-3(CO)(12), with and without a constant partial
   pressure of ammonia. Film growth was performed at a Ru-3(CO)(12)/Ar
   pressure of 47.2 mTorr. The ammonia partial pressure varied from 0 to
   27.8 mTorr. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the
   samples in situ. Ex situ characterization included scanning electron
   microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray diffraction and x-ray
   reflectivity. Nucleation studies limited to the first 10min of growth
   revealed the maximum nanoparticle (island) density of 8.1 x 10(11)
   cm(-2) occurred at an intermediate ammonia pressure (5.25 mTorr)
   compared to a density of 3.1 x 10(11) cm(-2) for no ammonia addition.
   Extending film growth to 120 min and varying the ammonia partial
   pressure during the first 10min followed by 5.25 mTorr ammonia pressure
   for the final 110 min reveals the importance of nucleation on film
   smoothness. A model describing the inhibition effects of ammonia during
   nucleation and growth is presented. (C) 2016 American Vacuum Society.}},

Title = {{Real-time estimation of reservoir influx rate and pore pressure using a

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{The ability to perform accurate pore pressure and reservoir inflow
   estimation during a kick incident is necessary, particularly when
   drilling in formations with narrow pressure margins. Currently available
   techniques for pore pressure estimation and reservoir characterization
   either rely on empirical correlations requiring access to well logging
   data and other petrophysical information, or require downhole pressure
   sensing and advanced flow metering capabilities. This paper introduces a
   model-based estimation technique which uses surface measurements
   commonly available in a Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) system, coupled
   With a simplified transient two-phase model. This model is capable of
   representing essential dynamics during a gas kick with reduced
   computational overhead, but without sacrificing significant modeling
   accuracy. First, the model is validated in a gas kick scenario against
   experimental data, showing good agreement between key measured
   parameters and the model predictions, and thereby justifying the model
   applicability to field operations. Next, data generated from a
   commercial simulator test case is used to evaluate the proposed
   estimation methodology. The estimated pore pressure and reservoir
   productivity are close to their respective values from the commercial
   simulator, and the flow out rate and surface back-pressure predicted by
   the simplified two-phase model yield very good match against the
   simulator results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Mach-scale rotor system, 2.03 m in diameter, was built and hover
   tested in three configurations: two-bladed single rotor, four-bladed
   single rotor, and two-bladed coaxial counter-rotating rotor. The blades
   were untwisted with a VR-12 airfoil profile and a constant chord of 76.2
   mm with a 3.8 mm trailing-edge tab. The hubs were rigid and had a
   vertical spacing of 13.8\% rotor radius. Individual rotor steady and
   vibratory hub loads as well as lower-rotor pushrod loads were measured
   for several blade loadings up to 0.095. Mean loads were used to analyze
   rotor performance with an analytical momentum theory model as well as to
   validate an in-house, free-vortex wake model. Statistical analysis of
   the measured data revealed clear trends with a known confidence level.
   Because of mutual interference, the upper and lower rotors of the
   coaxial configuration consumed 18 and 49\% more induced power than that
   of an isolated two-bladed rotor. The coaxial counter-rotating
   configuration was found to consume 6\% less induced power than an
   isolated four-bladed single rotor of equal solidity. While
   torque-balanced, the upper rotor was found to produce 54\% of the total
   system thrust regardless of blade loading. Rotor performance was not
   affected with an unbalanced torque of up to 5\%. The free-vortex wake
   model was used to gain insight into the flow physics responsible for the
   interference effects by exploring the radial inflow and thrust
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Risk management plans improve the likelihood of mission success by
   identifying potential failures early and planning mitigation methods to
   circumvent any issues. However, in the aerospace industry to date, risk
   management plans have typically only been used for larger and more
   expensive satellites and have rarely been applied to lower-cost
   satellites such as CubeSats. Furthermore, existing risk management plans
   typically require experienced personnel and significant time to perform
   the analysis. The CubeSat Decision Advisor tool uses components of
   decision theory such as decision trees, multi-attribute utility theory,
   and utility elicitation methods to determine the expected utilities of
   proposed mitigation techniques to a mission risk. Based on the user's
   value preference system, assessment of success probabilities, and
   resources required for a given mitigation technique, the tool suggests
   the course of action that will normatively yield the most value for the
   COST, people, and time resources required. This research creates a risk
   management software tool never before available that is easily
   accessible and usable for low-cost small satellite missions due to its
   construction in Microsoft Excel. A demonstration analysis is conducted
   on a university CubeSat mission as a case study. The target audience for
   this tool is primarily university labs, which could not otherwise afford
   expensive software packages. However, the tool is broadly applicable to
   all organizations, including government, academic, and corporate, and is
   not constrained to university small satellite mission architectures.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model of the internal flow in a duct rotating about one end
   is described. One-dimensional Euler equations are solved inside the duct
   using a finite volume formulation in which the advective fluxes are
   calculated using the advection upwind splitting method. The model was
   developed as a fast design tool for helicopter rotor blades with
   internal spanwise flow. To this end, centrifugal as well as Coriolis
   effects, frictional losses, duct sweep, and time-dependent duct boundary
   conditions are modeled, and a spanwise flow control valve can be
   included. The model is used to explore the behavior of a 2-m-long duct
   with a circular cross section, rotating at tip speeds of up to 260 m/s.
   The effects of centrifugal pumping, duct friction, duct sweep, and a
   flow control valve on the spanwise pressure and velocity distribution,
   mass flow rate of air through the duct, and torque required to spin the
   duct are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate matter was measured in Conroe, Texas (similar to 60 km north
   of downtown Houston, Texas) during the September 2013 DISCOVER-AQ
   campaign to determine the sources of particulate matter in the region.
   The measurement site is influenced by high biogenic emission rates as
   well as transport of anthropogenic pollutants from the Houston
   metropolitan area and is therefore an ideal location to study
   anthropogenic-biogenic interactions. Data from an Aerosol Chemical
   Speciation Monitor (ACSM) suggest that on average 64 percent of
   non-refractory PM1 was organic material, including a high fraction
   (27\%-41\%) of organic nitrates. There was little diurnal variation in
   the concentrations of ammonium sulfate; however, concentrations of
   organic and organic nitrate aerosol were consistently higher at night
   than during the day. Potential explanations for the higher organic
   aerosol loadings at night include changing boundary layer height,
   increased partitioning to the particle phase at lower temperatures, and
   differences between daytime and nighttime chemical processes such as
   nitrate radical chemistry. Positive matrix factorization was applied to
   the organic aerosol mass spectra measured by the ACSM and three factors
   were resolved-two factors representing oxygenated organic aerosol and
   one factor representing hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol. The factors
   suggest that the measured aerosol was well mixed and highly processed,
   consistent with the distance from the site to major aerosol sources, as
   well as the high photochemical activity.}},

Abstract = {{A pulsed ultrawideband (UWB) transceiver with four-element receiver
   beamforming is described. Multiband signaling with frequency hopping is
   employed to efficiently utilize spectrum from 6 to 8.5 GHz to achieve a
   high data rate of 1 Gbps. A pulse-based signaling approach with low
   implementation complexity is utilized. Frequency-hopping reduces the
   overhead for multiband implementation by sharing multiple circuit blocks
   in the transmitter and receiver paths. The sinusoids for pulse-shaping
   and single-sideband mixing are synthesized using multiphase LOs to avoid
   high-speed DACs. The receiver channelizes the spectrum with cascaded
   mixers for which the LO signals are derived from a single PLL. A
   single-input multi-output (SIMO) beamforming architecture is employed to
   increase the sensitivity of the receiver. Beamforming is performed at
   baseband to avoid the requirement for a wideband delay circuit. The
   prototype is implemented in 65 nm CMOS and meets the ECC mask. The
   measured power dissipation of the transmitter is 221 mW, while that of
   the receiver is 211 mW. A receiver sensitivity of -69 dBm is achieved
   and Gbps communication over 2 m is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that graphene placed on top of curved substrates offers a
   novel approach for trapping and guiding surface plasmons. Monolayer
   graphene with a spatially varying curvature exhibits an effective
   trapping potential for graphene plasmons near curved areas such as

   such localized channel plasmons guided by curved graphene and validate
   our theory by first-principle numerical simulations. The proposed
   confinement mechanism enables plasmon guiding by the regions of maximal
   curvature, and it offers a versatile platform for manipulating light in
   planar landscapes. In addition, isolated deformations of graphene such
   as bumps are shown to support localized surface modes and resonances,
   suggesting a new way to engineer graphene-based metasurfaces.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},

Abstract = {{A technique is developed that uses planar laser-induced fluorescence
   (PLIF) of sublimated gas-phase naphthalene to visualize the transport of
   ablation products in a high-speed turbulent boundary layer. The
   naphthalene is molded into a rectangular insert that is mounted flush
   with the floor of a Mach 5 wind tunnel, where the test gas is air. The
   naphthalene fluorescence is excited with 266 nm laser light, and
   broadband detection of the emitted light is used. Using spectroscopic
   data from a previous study and a first-order approximation for the mean
   temperature profile across the boundary layer, naphthalene PLIF images
   collected in a Mach 5 turbulent boundary layer are converted into
   two-dimensional fields of naphthalene mole fraction with an
   instantaneous uncertainty of +/-20 \%. These quantitative naphthalene
   PLIF images in the Mach 5 boundary layer reveal large-scale naphthalene
   vapor structures that are regularly ejected out to wall distances of
   approximately y/delta = 0.6 for a field of view that spans 3 delta-5
   delta downstream of the trailing edge of the naphthalene insert. The
   magnitude of the calculated naphthalene mole fraction in these
   structures at y/delta = 0.2 ranges from approximately 1 to 6 \% of the
   saturation mole fraction at the wind tunnel recovery temperature and
   static pressure. Mean mole fraction profiles taken at different
   streamwise locations collapse into one ``universal{''} mole fraction
   profile when properly normalized and are in agreement with previous
   scalar dispersion measurements. The results indicate that PLIF of
   sublimating naphthalene can be an effective tool for studying scalar
   transport in supersonic and hypersonic flows.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Novel approaches are needed for discovery of targeted
   therapies for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that are specific to
   certain patients. Whole genome RNAi screening of lung cancer cell lines
   provides an ideal source for determining candidate drug targets.
   Results: Unsupervised learning algorithms uncovered patterns of
   differential vulnerability across lung cancer cell lines to loss of
   functionally related genes. Such genetic vulnerabilities represent
   candidate targets for therapy and are found to be involved in splicing,
   translation and protein folding. In particular, many NSCLC cell lines
   were especially sensitive to the loss of components of the LSm2-8
   protein complex or the CCT/TRiC chaperonin. Different vulnerabilities
   were also found for different cell line subgroups. Furthermore, the
   predicted vulnerability of a single adenocarcinoma cell line to loss of
   the Wnt pathway was experimentally validated with screening of
   small-molecule Wnt inhibitors against an extensive cell line panel.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid analog/digital precoding offers a compromise between hardware
   complexity and system performance in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems.
   This type of precoding allows mmWave systems to leverage large antenna
   array gains that are necessary for sufficient link margin, while
   permitting low cost and power consumption hardware. Most prior work has
   focused on hybrid precoding for narrow-band mmWave systems, with perfect
   or estimated channel knowledge at the transmitter. MmWave systems,
   however, will likely operate on wideband channels with frequency
   selectivity. Therefore, this paper considers wideband mmWave systems
   with a limited feedback channel between the transmitter and receiver.
   First, the optimal hybrid precoding design for a given RF codebook is
   derived. This provides a benchmark for any other heuristic algorithm and
   gives useful insights into codebook designs. Second, efficient hybrid
   analog/digital codebooks are developed for spatial multiplexing in
   wideband mmWave systems. Finally, a low-complexity yet near-optimal
   greedy frequency selective hybrid precoding algorithm is proposed based
   on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. Simulation results show that the
   developed hybrid codebooks and precoder designs achieve very-good
   performance compared with the unconstrained solutions while requiring
   much less complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a spatial general equilibrium model to explore the
   land use effects of three roadway congestion pricing strategies in both
   monocentric and polycentric city settings, where household and firm
   locations and wage rates are endogenously determined. Simulation results
   show how marginal cost pricing (MCP) of travel in the polycentric
   setting can cause many jobs (16\% in this example) to leave the central
   business district (CBD) and relocate to a relatively dense but suburban
   ring. To achieve city-wide welfare gains, efficient land use regulations
   should permit such job decentralization. Simulations also illuminate how
   simple, distance-based tolls generate lower welfare improvements, but
   stimulate similar land use effects. A cordon toll imposed in monocentric
   cities may agglomerate all firms in a smaller CBD or re-agglomerate
   parts of firms in a sub-center ring of development. Overall, results
   highlight how an urban economic model enabling endogenous business and
   household decisions can illuminate various travel, congestion pricing,
   and land use connections. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In reservoir simulation, compositional modeling is one of the most
   commonly used approaches for enhanced oil recovery processes. The
   methods used to solve the equations arising from the modeling of fluid
   flow in the reservoirs involve the degree of implicitness and the
   selection of the primary and secondary equations; primary and secondary
   variables have a great impact on the computational time. In this work,
   we implement and compare two fully implicit methods based on volume
   balance approach. The two methods share the same set of primary
   variables: pressure and total number of moles of each component. The
   total number of moles of each component is solved with use its material
   balance equation, whereas the pressure is solved with use of a volume
   balance equation. The difference between the two methods is in the
   nature of the volume balance equation. Whereas for one of the
   formulations the volume balance equation is the volume constraint and
   hence the only terms that appear in the Jacobian matrix are those from
   the volume in which the volume balance is evaluated, the second
   formulation considers an expanded form of the volume constraint. The
   main advantage of this expanded equation is that the Jacobian matrix
   involves information from the volume in which the balance is performed
   and from all neighboring volumes. The element-based finite-volume method
   in conjunction with unstructured grids for 2D and 3D reservoirs is used
   to discretize the material and volume balance equations. For two
   dimensions, quadrilateral and triangular elements are considered,
   whereas for three dimensions, hexahedral, prismatic, tetrahedral, and
   pyramidal elements are considered. The implementations were performed
   with the UT COMP simulator developed at the University of Texas at
   Austin. We compare the performance of the two above-mentioned fully
   implicit formulations with the implicit pressure explicit composition
   (IMPEC) formulation of the UTCOMP simulator. The results of several case
   studies are compared in terms of volumetric oil and gas rates and the
   total CPU time. The results show good agreement between the production
   rates and saturation fields for all formulations. Additionally, the
   performance of the fully implicit methods was superior to that of the
   IMPEC method as a larger number of grid blocks were used in the
   simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Lyapunov-based approach is presented to design finite-thrust
   closed-loop guidance schemes in a two-body model, to perform any general
   orbit transfer. The design is performed in the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (KS)
   model, a regularized two-body framework. The KS model aids in the design
   of the guidance schemes, but the new guidance solutions can be
   explicitly characterized in the regular two-body model. The control
   scheme covers two main phases: first, a matching of the semi-major axis
   of the target orbit; and second, a matching of the remaining desired

Abstract = {{Calcium carbonate biomineralization is a bio-chemical process in which
   calcium carbonate precipitation is obtained by leveraging the metabolic
   activity of microorganisms. Studies have shown that biomineralization
   can be used to repair surface cracks in cement-based materials. One of
   the challenges in determining whether biomineralization is a feasible
   option for internal crack repair pertains to how to monitor and quantify
   self healing of internal microcracks. In this study, mortar samples with
   and without microcracks and microorganisms were cured in different
   environments until 50 days. Coda wave interferometry measurements, a
   nondestructive method that is very sensitive to small changes in
   material, were conducted on these samples to evaluate the extent of
   self-healing during the entire curing period. Compressive strength tests
   were performed after 7 and 28 days of curing. The results indicated that
   the cracked mortar samples with microorganisms showed significantly
   higher strength development and higher relative velocity change than
   samples without microorganisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To enable commercial use of alkali-activated fly ash concrete, its
   durability must be better understood. Alkali-silica reaction is a
   primary concern since highly alkaline solutions are generally used for
   activation. This study investigated the effect of NaOH activating
   solution concentration on pore solution alkalinity and subsequent
   alkali-silica reaction in alkali-activated fly ash concrete. It was
   found that pore solution alkalinity increased with increasing activating
   solution NaOH concentration, and this effect was amplified at
   concentrations above an optimum, defined as the concentration that
   resulted in the highest mortar compressive strength. Expansion of
   concrete prisms containing highly reactive fine aggregate and activating
   solution concentrations above the optimum concentration was
   approximately three times that of concrete with optimum activating
   solution concentrations, but only about 5\% of the expansion observed in
   the ordinary portland cement control. The low expansion may be
   attributed to the low calcium levels in the alkali-activated fly ash
   concrete. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Correlation between blood pressure (BP) and target organ damage,
   vascular risk and long-term patient prognosis is greater for
   measurements derived from around-the-clock ambulatory BP monitoring than
   in-clinic daytime ones. Numerous studies consistently substantiate the
   asleep BP mean is both an independent and a much better predictor of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than either the awake or 24 h means.
   Sleep-time hypertension is much more prevalent than suspected, not only
   in patients with sleep disorders, but also among those who are elderly
   or have type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease or resistant
   hypertension. Hence, cost-effective adequate control of sleep-time BP is
   of marked clinical relevance. Ingestion time, according to circadian
   rhythms, of hypertension medications of six different classes and their
   combinations significantly affects BP control, particularly sleep-time
   BP, and adverse effects. For example, because the high-amplitude
   circadian rhythm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activates
   during nighttime sleep, bedtime vs. morning ingestion of
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
   blockers better reduces the asleep BP mean, with additional benefit,
   independent of medication terminal half-life, of converting the 24 h BP
   profile into more normal dipper patterning. The MAPEC (Monitorizacion
   Ambulatoria para Prediccion de Eventos Cardiovasculares) study, first
   prospective randomized treatment-time investigation designed to test the
   worthiness of bedtime chronotherapy with >= 1 conventional hypertension
   medications so as to specifically target attenuation of asleep BP,
   demonstrated, relative to conventional morning therapy, 61\% reduction
   of total CVD events and 67\% decrease of major CVD events, that is, CVD
   death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. The
   MAPEC study, along with other earlier conducted less refined trials,
   documents the asleep BP mean is the most significant prognostic marker
   of CVD morbidity and mortality; moreover, it substantiates attenuation
   of the asleep BP mean by a bedtime hypertension treatment strategy
   entailing the entire daily dose of >= 1 hypertension medications
   significantly reduces CVD risk in both general and more vulnerable
   hypertensive patients, that is, those diagnosed with chronic kidney
   disease, diabetes and resistant hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{A new virtual metrology (VM) method for estimation of product quality
   characteristics will be presented using the recently introduced growing
   structure multiple model system (GSMMS) approach for modeling of
   non-linear dynamic systems. The underlying concept of local linear
   models enables representation of non-linear dependencies with
   non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise characteristics. In addition,
   localized analysis of VM inputs within the GSMMS framework enables
   detection of situations when the model is not adequate and needs to be
   improved. The newly proposed method was applied to an extensive dataset
   gathered from a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition tool operating
   in a major semiconductor manufacturing fab, with tool signatures being
   used to predict the mean film thicknesses on the wafers. The GSMMS-based
   VM significantly decreased the number of measurements necessary for
   prediction, while improving VM accuracy, as compared to several linear
   and nonlinear benchmark VM methodologies. These beneficial results are
   credited to the GSMMS being able to store local models within its
   growing network of local VM models corresponding to various operating
   regimes of the underlying manufacturing machine, as well as to recognize
   situations when new physical measurements need to be taken and when new
   local VM models need to be added.}},

Abstract = {{The spinel Li{[}Mn-2]O-4 is a candidate cathode for a Li-ion battery,
   but its capacity fades over a charge/discharge cycle of Li1-x{[}Mn-2]O-4
   (0 < x < 1) that is associated with a loss of Mn to the organic-liquid
   electrolyte. It is known that the disproportionation reaction 2Mn(3+) =
   Mn2+ = Mn4+ occurs at the surface of a Mn spinel, and it is important to
   understand the atomic structure and composition of the surface of
   Li{[}Mn-2]O-4 in order to understand how Mn loss occurs. We report a
   study of the surface reconstruction of Li{[}Mn-2]O-4 by
   aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. The
   atomic structure coupled with Mn-valence and the distribution of the
   atomic ratio of oxygen obtained by electron energy loss spectroscopy
   reveals a thin, stable surface layer of Mn3O4, a subsurface region of
   Li1+x{[}Mn-2]O-4 with retention of bulk Li{[}Mn-2]O-4. This observation
   is compatible with the disproportionation reaction coupled with oxygen
   deficiency and a displacement of surface Li+ from the Mn3O4 surface
   phase. These results provide a critical step toward understanding how Mn
   is lost from Li{[}Mn-2]O-4, once inside a battery.}},

Abstract = {{We present an efficient first-principles method for simulating
   noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) images using a ``frozen
   density{''} embedding theory. Frozen density embedding theory enables
   one to efficiently compute the tip-sample interaction by considering a
   sample as a frozen external field. This method reduces the extensive
   computational load of first principles AFM simulations by avoiding
   consideration of the entire tip-sample system and focusing on the tip
   alone. We demonstrate that our simulation with frozen density embedding
   theory accurately reproduces full density functional theory simulations
   of freestanding hydrocarbon molecules while the computational time is
   significantly reduced. Our method also captures the electronic effect of
   a Cu(111) substrate on the AFM image of pentacene and reproduces the
   experimental AFM image of Cu2N on a Cu(100) surface. This approach is
   applicable for theoretical imaging applications on large molecules,
   two-dimensional materials, and materials surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Organic electroactive materials represent a new generation of
   sustainable energy storage technology due to their unique features
   including environmental benignity, material sustainability, and highly
   tailorable properties. Here a carbonyl-based organic salt Na2C6O6,
   sodium rhodizonate (SR) dibasic, is systematically investigated for
   high-performance sodium-ion batteries. A combination of structural
   control, electrochemical analysis, and computational simulation show
   that rational morphological control can lead to significantly improved
   sodium storage performance. A facile antisolvent method was developed to
   synthesize microbulk, microrod, and nanorod structured SRs, which
   exhibit strong size-dependent sodium ion storage properties. The SR
   nanorod exhibited the best performance to deliver a reversible capacity
   of similar to 190 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C with over 90\% retention after 100
   cycles. At a high rate of 10 C, 50\% of the capacity can be obtained due
   to enhanced reaction kinetics, and such high electrochemical activity
   maintains even at 80 degrees C. These results demonstrate a generic
   design route toward high-performance organic-based electrode materials
   for beyond Li-ion batteries. Using such a biomass-derived organic
   electrode material enables access to sustainable energy storage devices
   with low cost, high electrochemical performance and thermal stability.}},

Journal = {{NANO LETTERS}},

Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Defects may tend to make crystals interesting but they do not always
   improve performance. In doped metal oxide nanocrystals with localized
   surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), aliovalent dopants and oxygen
   vacancies act as centers for ionized impurity scattering of electrons.
   Such electronic damping leads to lossy, broadband LSPR with low quality
   factors, limiting applications that require near-field concentration of
   light. However, the appropriate dopant can mitigate ionized impurity
   scattering. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a
   novel doped metal oxide nanocrystal material, cerium-doped indium oxide
   (Ce:In2O3). Ce:In2O3 nanocrystals display tunable mid-infrared LSPR with
   exceptionally narrow line widths and the highest quality factors
   observed for nanocrystals in this spectral region. Drude model fits to
   the spectra indicate that a drastic reduction in ionized impurity
   scattering is responsible for the enhanced quality factors, and high
   electronic mobilities reaching 33 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) are measured
   optically, well above the optical mobility for tin-doped indium oxide
   (ITO) nanocrystals. We investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying
   this enhanced mobility with density functional theory calculations,
   which suggest that scattering is reduced because cerium orbitals do not
   hybridize with the In orbitals that dominate the bottom of the
   conduction band. Ce doping may also reduce the equilibrium oxygen
   vacancy concentration, further enhancing mobility. From the absorption
   spectra of single Ce:In2O3 nanocrystals, we determine the dielectric
   function and by simulation predict strong near-field enhancement of
   mid-IR light, especially around the vertices of our synthesized
   nanocubes.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Infrared-responsive doped metal oxide nanocrystals are an emerging class
   of plasmonic materials whose localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR)
   can be resonant with molecular vibrations. This presents a distinctive
   opportunity to manipulate light-matter interactions to redirect chemical
   or spectroscopic outcomes through the strong local electric fields they
   generate. Here we report a technique for measuring single nanocrystal
   absorption spectra of doped metal oxide nanocrystals, revealing
   significant spectral inhomogeneity in their mid-infrared LSPRs. Our
   analysis suggests dopant incorporation is heterogeneous beyond
   expectation based on a statistical distribution of dopants. The broad
   ensemble linewidths typically observed in these materials result
   primarily from sample heterogeneity and not from strong electronic
   damping associated with lossy plasmonic materials. In fact, single
   nanocrystal spectra reveal linewidths as narrow as 600 cm(-1) in
   aluminium-doped zinc oxide, a value less than half the ensemble
   linewidth and markedly less than homogeneous linewidths of gold
   nanospheres.}},

Title = {{Oxygen-activated growth and bandgap tunability of large single-crystal
   bilayer graphene}},

Abstract = {{Bernal (AB)-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) is a semiconductor whose
   bandgap can be tuned by a transverse electric field, making it a unique
   material for a number of electronic and photonic devices(1-3). A
   scalable approach to synthesize high-quality BLG is therefore critical,
   which requires minimal crystalline defects in both graphene layers(4,5)
   and maximal area of Bernal stacking, which is necessary for bandgap
   tunability(6). Here we demonstrate that in an oxygen-activated chemical
   vapour deposition (CVD) process, half-millimetre size, Bernal-stacked
   BLG single crystals can be synthesized on Cu. Besides the traditional
   `surface-limited' growth mechanism for SLG (1st layer), we discovered
   new microscopic steps governing the growth of the 2nd graphene layer
   below the 1st layer as the diffusion of carbon atoms through the Cu bulk
   after complete dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon molecules on the Cu
   surface, which does not occur in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, we
   found that the efficient diffusion of the carbon atoms present at the
   interface between Cu and the 1st graphene layer further facilitates
   growth of large domains of the 2nd layer. The CVD BLG has superior
   electrical quality, with a device on/off ratio greater than 10(4), and a
   tunable bandgap up to similar to 100 meV at a displacement field of 0.9
   V nm(-1).}},

Title = {{Distributed partitioning algorithms for multi-agent networks with
   quadratic proximity metrics and sensing constraints}},
Journal = {{SYSTEMS \& CONTROL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{36-42}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We consider a class of Voronoi-like partitioning problems, in which a
   multi-agent network seeks to subdivide a subset of an affine space into
   a finite number of cells in the presence of Sensing constraints. The
   cell of this subdivision that is assigned to a particular agent consists
   exclusively of points that can be sensed by this agent and are closer to
   it than to any other agent that can also sense them. The proximity
   between an agent and an arbitrary point is measured in terms of a
   non-homogeneous quadratic (generalized) distance function, which does
   not, in general, enjoy the triangle inequality and the symmetry
   property. One of the consequences of this fact is that the structure of
   the sublevel sets of the utilized proximity metric does not conform with
   that of the sensing region of an agent. Due to this mismatch, it is
   possible that a point may be assigned to an agent which is different
   from its ``nearest{''} agent simply because the nearest agent cannot
   sense this point, unless special care is taken. We propose a distributed
   partitioning algorithm that enables each agent to compute its own cell
   independently from the other agents when the only information available
   to it is the positions and the velocities of the agents that lie inside
   its sensing region. The algorithm is based on an iterative process that
   adjusts the size of the sensing region of each agent until the
   associated cell of the latter corresponds to the intersection of its
   sensing region with the cell that would have been assigned to it in the
   absence of sensing constraints. The correctness of the proposed
   distributed algorithm, which successfully handles the aforementioned
   issues, is studied in detail. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Few studies on naphthalene vapor fluorescence have been conducted at low
   temperature and pressure conditions. The current study focuses on
   conducting measurements of naphthalene quenching and absorption cross
   section in a temperature-and pressure-regulated test cell with 266 nm
   laser excitation. The test-cell measurements were of the
   naphthalene-fluorescence lifetime and integrated fluorescence signal
   over the temperature range of 100 to 525 K and pressure range of 1 to 40
   kPa in air. These data enabled the calculation of
   naphthalene-fluorescence quantum yield and absorption cross section over
   the range of temperatures and pressures tested, which were then fit to
   simple functional forms for future use in the calibration of naphthalene
   laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements. Furthermore, the
   variation of naphthalene-fluorescence signal with respect to temperature
   was investigated for four different excitation wavelengths,
   demonstrating that a two-line naphthalene LIF thermometry technique may
   be feasible. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of tissues can provide valuable information
   about tissue integrity and health and can assist in detecting and
   monitoring the progression of diseases such as keratoconus. Optical
   coherence elastography (OCE) is a rapidly emerging technique, which can
   assess localized mechanical contrast in tissues with micrometer spatial
   resolution. In this paper, we present a noncontact method of OCE to
   evaluate the changes in the mechanical properties of the cornea after
   UV-induced collagen crosslinking. A focused air-pulse induced a
   low-amplitude (micrometer scale) elastic wave, which then propagated
   radially and was imaged in three dimensions by a phase-stabilized
   swept-source optical coherence tomography system. The elastic wave
   velocity was translated to Young's modulus in agar phantoms of various
   concentrations. Additionally, the speed of the elastic wave
   significantly changed in porcine cornea before and after UV-induced
   corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL). Moreover, different layers of the
   cornea, such as the anterior stroma, posterior stroma, and inner region,
   could be discerned from the phase velocities of the elastic wave.
   Therefore, because of noncontact excitation and imaging, this method may
   be useful for in vivo detection of ocular diseases such as keratoconus
   and evaluation of therapeutic interventions such as CXL.}},

Abstract = {{Adders are the most fundamental arithmetic units, and often on the
   timing critical paths of microprocessors. Among various adder
   configurations, parallel prefix adders provide the best performance vs.
   power/area trade-off, especially for higher bit-widths. With aggressive
   technology scaling, the performance of a parallel prefix adder, in
   addition to the dependence on the logic-level, is determined by
   wire-length and congestion which can be mitigated by adjusting fan-out.
   This paper proposes a polynomial-time algorithm to synthesize n bit
   parallel prefix adders targeting the minimization of the size of the
   prefix graph with log(2) n logic level and any arbitrary fan-out
   restriction. A structure aware prefix node cloning is then applied to
   the resultant prefix adder solutions to further optimize the size of the
   prefix graphs. The design space exploration by our approach provides a
   set of pareto-optimal solutions for delay vs. power trade-off, and these
   pareto-optimal solutions can be used in high-performance designs instead
   of picking from a fixed library (Kogge-Stone, Sklansky, etc.).
   Experimental results demonstrate that our approach: 1) excels highly
   competitive industry standard Synopsys design compiler adder, regular
   adders such as Sklansky adder and Kogge-Stone adder, and a highly
   run-time/memory intensive recent algorithm in 32 nm technology node and
   2) improves performance/area over even 64 bit custom designed adders
   targeting 22 nm technology library and implemented in an industrial
   high-performance design.}},

Abstract = {{Consider the recovery of an unknown signal x from quantized linear
   measurements. In the one-bit compressive sensing setting, one typically
   assumes that x is sparse, and that the measurements are of the form
   sign(< a(i), x >) is an element of \{+/- 1\}. Since such measurements
   give no information on the norm of x, recovery methods typically assume
   that parallel to x parallel to(2) = 1. We show that if one allows more
   generally for quantized affine measurements of the form sign(< a(i), x >
   + b(i)), and if the vectors a(i) are random, an appropriate choice of
   the affine shifts b(i) allows norm recovery to be easily incorporated
   into existing methods for one-bit compressive sensing. In addition, we
   show that for arbitrary fixed x in the annulus r <= parallel to x
   parallel to(2) <= R, one may estimate the norm parallel to x parallel
   to(2) up to additive error delta from m greater than or similar to
   R(4)r(-2)delta(-2) such binary measurements through a single evaluation
   of the inverse Gaussian error function. Finally, all of our recovery
   guarantees can be made universal over sparse vectors in the sense that
   with high probability, one set of measurements and thresholds can
   successfully estimate all sparse vectors x in a Euclidean ball of known
   radius.}},

Abstract = {{Wind power ramp events have become one of the major challenges of power
   balance in power systems with high wind power penetration. Conventional
   thermal or hydro units have to be dispatched, shut down or started up
   more frequently to keep the balance between generation and load. This
   paper proposes a wind power ramp control method with energy storage
   system (ESS) based on wind power ramp event forecast. An optimization
   model is established to optimize the output power of ESS and the wind
   curtailment to meet a hybrid wind power ramp limit. Three types of wind
   power ramp scenarios are presented based on the ramp event forecast,
   including normal scenario, positive ramp scenarios, and negative ramp
   scenarios. In each scenario, the optimization model is modified with
   scenario switching adjustment (SSA) to reduce the capacity demand of ESS
   and the curtailed wind energy. While the parameters for modification are
   obtained by different fuzzy logic systems (FLS). Finally, the
   effectiveness of the proposed wind power ramp control method is verified
   through case studies.}},

Title = {{Integration N-1 of Contingency Analysis With Systematic Transmission
   Capacity Expansion Planning: ERCOT Case Study}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a method for N - 1 contingency constrained
   transmission capacity expansion planning (TCEP), which is formulated as
   a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. In relatively well-designed
   power systems, a single outage of a majority of lines will not usually
   cause overload on other lines in most loading conditions. Thus they will
   not affect the feasible region and the optimal answer of the TCEP
   optimization problem, and can be safely removed from contingency
   analysis if we can identify them. A contingency identification index is
   developed to detect these lines and create variable contingency lists
   (VCL) for different network loading conditions. In our proposed method,
   we use results of a relaxed version of the original problem as a lower
   bound answer in the first step, and integrate contingencies into TCEP in
   the next steps to solve this optimization problem faster while still
   satisfying N - 1 criterion. For solving TCEP with contingencies, two
   options are offered, i. e., option A that uses an updated system as its
   base case (original existing network together with selected lines by the
   relaxed problem) and option B that uses the original existing network as
   its base case (without results of the relaxed problem). Option A is
   faster than option B because it usually should select fewer new lines
   compared to B, but cannot guarantee optimality. Option B provides the
   optimal answer while taking more computational time. An ERCOT case study
   is used to show capabilities of the proposed method for solving large
   scale problems, and the numerical result demonstrates this method is
   much faster than the integrated MIP method that directly incorporates
   all contingencies.}},

Abstract = {{Grid security and open markets are two major smart grid goals.
   Transparency of market data facilitates a competitive and efficient
   energy environment. But it may also reveal critical physical system
   information. Recovering the grid topology based solely on publicly
   available market data is explored here. Real-time energy prices are
   typically calculated as the Lagrange multipliers of network-constrained
   economic dispatch; that is, via a linear program (LP) typically solved
   every 5 min. Since the grid Laplacian matrix is a parameter of this LP,
   someone apart from the system operator could try inferring this
   topology-related matrix upon observing successive LP dual outcomes. It
   is first shown that the matrix of spatio-temporal prices can be factored
   as the product of the inverse Laplacian times a sparse matrix.
   Leveraging results from sparse matrix decompositions, topology recovery
   schemes with complementary strengths are subsequently formulated.
   Solvers scalable to high-dimensional and streaming market data are
   devised. Numerical validation using synthetic and real-load data on the
   IEEE 30-bus grid provide useful input for current and future market
   designs.}},

   developed and experimentally verified. The correction circuit is
   implemented in a 0.13-mu m CMOS technology and occupies an area of 0.011
   mm(2). It corrects to a residual error of less than 1\%. The extent of
   correction is limited by the technology at higher frequencies.}},

Title = {{Using Metal Deck Forms for Construction Bracing in Steel Bridges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Metal deck forms are frequently used in the steel building and bridge
   industries as formwork for the wet concrete slab. Although the forms are
   often relied on for stability bracing during construction in buildings,
   conventional connection details between the forms and girder top flanges
   in the bridge industry possess an eccentricity that limits the bracing
   performance of the forms. A research study to assess and improve the
   bracing potential of permanent metal deck forms (PMDFs) used in bridge
   applications was conducted. Recommendations from the research study were
   implemented on two steel I-girder bridges located on the IH-610 north
   loop in Houston. The use of the PMDF bracing resulted in the elimination
   of 680 intermediate diaphragms from the bridges. Before the
   implementation project, laboratory buckling tests were conducted on a
   twin-girder system with members and bracing that were identical to those
   used in the implementation project. To the authors' knowledge, this
   project represents the first time that metal deck forms were relied on
   for stability bracing of steel I girders in the bridge industry. This
   paper documents laboratory testing, design, and construction of the two
   bridges in which PMDFs were used as construction bracing for the steel I
   girders in the bridge superstructure. Laboratory test results showed
   that the forming system, which was at the lower span limit of PMDF
   systems frequently used in steel bridge systems, could provide suitable
   bracing for the two implementation bridges. Using metal deck forms for
   bracing, the bridges were designed with no intermediate diaphragms/cross
   frames. A total of 680 intermediate diaphragms that would have been
   required in a bridge with conventional bracing were eliminated. The
   implementation of the research recommendations in the design of steel
   bridges can result in substantial improvements on the efficiency and
   economics of bracing systems for steel bridge superstructures.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The fundamental purpose of any construction specification is to ensure
   the expected long-term performance of the final product. A construction
   project that fails to meet the required quality level should always
   result in reduced payment to the contractor in order to recover the
   future costs that the highway agency will incur for additional
   maintenance. However, a superior-quality project must be rewarded based
   on actual savings to the agency that correspond with the improvement in
   performance due to higher construction quality. Performance-related
   specification (PRS) incorporates the economic implications associated
   with superior or inferior pavement construction practices. In general,
   earlier PRS development studies were based on performance data collected
   from either pilot pavement construction projects or models built based
   on experimental pavement sections. This study primarily focuses on
   constructing a pay adjustment framework utilizing field performance data
   and actual quality control measurements obtained during road
   construction projects. An econometric modeling approach for establishing
   the relationship between quality control parameters and the
   corresponding pavement performance (in terms of early deterioration
   rate) is proposed. Laboratory density of plant-mix, placement density of
   compacted pavement, and as-constructed ride quality are identified as
   performance-sensitive parameters. A performance-related, pay adjustment
   scheme that is governed by performance-sensitive quality control
   parameters is also developed. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{An offshore wind turbine supported by a spar buoy floating platform is
   the subject of this study on tower and rotor extreme loads. The

   with the mooring system consisting of three catenary lines, chosen for
   loads modeling, is based on the ``Hywind{''} floating wind turbine
   concept. Our interest lies in gaining an understanding of the dynamic
   coupling between the support platform motion and the turbine loads. We
   first investigate short-term response statistics using stochastic
   simulation for a range of different environmental wind and wave

Abstract = {{We report an inkjet-printed microscale magnetic structure that can be
   integrated on regular glass slides for the immunomagnetic screening of
   rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs). CTCs detach from the primary tumor
   site, circulate with the bloodstream, and initiate the cancer metastasis
   process. Therefore, a liquid biopsy in the form of capturing and
   analyzing CTCs may provide key information for cancer prognosis and
   diagnosis. Inkjet printing technology provides a non-contact,
   layer-by-layer and mask-less approach to deposit defined magnetic
   patterns on an arbitrary substrate. Such thin film patterns, when placed
   in an external magnetic field, significantly enhance the attractive
   force in the near-field close to the CTCs to facilitate the separation.
   We demonstrated the efficacy of the inkjet-print micromagnet array
   integrated immunomagnetic assay in separating COLO205 (human colorectal
   cancer cell line) from whole blood samples. The micromagnets increased
   the capture efficiency by 26\% compared with using plain glass slide as

Abstract = {{We examine the growth of cracks under mixed-mode I + III loading

   identify that crack front fragmentation occurs through nucleation of
   nearly regularly spaced daughter cracks, and that coarsening of this

   It is shown further that linkage of the daughter cracks does not occur
   concurrently with the formation of the primary system of daughter
   cracks, but at a later stage of the growth of the daughter cracks. A
   mechanism of the combined growth of the parent and daughter cracks under

Abstract = {{The discovery of topological photonic states has revolutionized our
   understanding of electromagnetic propagation and scattering. Endowed
   with topological robustness, photonic edge modes are not reflected from
   structural imperfections and disordered regions. Here we demonstrate
   robust propagation along reconfigurable pathways defined by synthetic
   gauge fields within a topological photonic metacrystal. The flow of
   microwave radiation in helical edge modes following arbitrary contours
   of the synthetic gauge field between bianisotropic metacrystal domains
   is unimpeded. This is demonstrated in measurements of the spectrum of
   transmission and time delay along the topological domain walls. These
   results provide a framework for freely steering electromagnetic

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Different ventilation strategies can have an enormous impact on both
   exposures to contaminants of concern (COCs) and energy use in retail
   buildings. We applied a multi-contaminant model of an area normalized
   retail store, and developed estimates for distributions of model inputs.
   We then used these distributions in a Monte Carlo simulation for six
   cities to compare the impacts of the ASHRAE 62.1-2013 ventilation rate
   procedure (VRP), demand controlled ventilation (DCV), and indoor air
   quality procedure (IAQP), with or without using a high particulate
   efficiency filter. Results showed that for cities where outdoor PM2.5
   concentration is low, adopting the IAQP with low efficiency PM2.5 filter
   in grocery stores and the VRP with high PM2.5 efficiency in non-grocery
   stores yielded the greatest exposure benefits. For cities with high
   outdoor PM2.5 concentration, adopting the VRP with high PM2.5 efficiency
   for all store types yielded the greatest exposure benefits. However,
   these exposure benefits also caused an increase in energy consumption,
   and the magnitude depends on the city's climate, outdoor PM2.5
   concentration and the retail store type. We propose a new pollutant
   exposure control ventilation (PECV) strategy, where ventilation rates
   are weighed against exposure to different COCs, and the ventilation rate
   that is most climatically advantageous is chosen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Mixed-mode traction-separation relations between graphene and copper by
   blister tests}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{147-159}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{A blister test with associated analysis was developed to characterize
   the traction-separation relations associated with interactions between
   graphene and a copper substrate to which it had been transferred.
   Graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition was backed by a photoresist
   film and transferred to a highly polished copper substrate from its seed
   copper foil. The graphene/photoresist composite film was then
   pressurized with deionized water through a hole in the substrate. The
   blister profiles and normal crack opening displacements (NCOD) were
   measured by two microscopes with synchronized cameras. Different
   mixed-mode conditions were achieved by varying the thickness of the
   backing layers. The measured adhesion energy for the graphene/copper and
   photoresist/copper interfaces showed a strong dependence on the
   mode-mix. Cohesive zone models associated with traction-separation
   relations were then developed to study the damage initiation and crack
   propagation under various mixed-mode conditions. The numerical solutions
   for the resistance curves, pressure vs. deflection, and NCOD were in
   good agreement with measurements. The cohesive zone model was extended
   to a wider range of mode-mixes by making use of the asperity locking
   model which had provided a mechanism for the observed toughening effect.
   The interactions between graphene and copper were found to be stronger
   in all respects than those associated with photoresist and copper.
   Because the monolayer graphene was sandwiched between photoresist and
   copper, this result suggests that graphene was not transparent to
   interactions between photoresist and copper, but opaque. The use of
   pressure could provide another approach to transfer large-scale
   graphene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Time delay is a common phenomenon in robotic systems due to
   computational requirements and communication properties between or
   within high-level and low-level controllers as well as the physical
   constraints of the actuator and sensor. It is widely believed that
   delays are harmful for robotic systems in terms of stability and
   performance; however, we propose a different view that the time delay of
   the system may in some cases benefit system stability and performance.
   Therefore, in this paper, we discuss the influences of the
   displacement-feedback delay (single delay) and both displacement and
   velocity feedback delays (double delays) on robotic actuator systems by
   using the cluster treatment of characteristic roots (CTCR) methodology.
   Hence, we can ascertain the exact stability interval for single-delay
   systems and the rigorous stability region for double-delay systems. The
   influences of controller gains and the filtering frequency on the
   stability of the system are discussed. Based on the stability
   information coupled with the dominant root distribution, we propose one
   nonconventional rule which suggests increasing time delay to certain
   time windows to obtain the optimal system performance. The computation
   results are also verified on an actuator testbed.}},

Title = {{Application of magnetic nanoparticles mixed with propping agents in
   enhancing near-wellbore fracture detection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{133-143}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Reliable evaluation of proppant placement in hydraulic fractures is
   challenging because there are environmental and regulatory concerns
   about existing techniques which use radioactive tracers. Recent research
   investigations have shown the potential for the application of
   nanoparticles as contrast agents for reservoir characterization and
   advanced reservoir surveillance. This paper demonstrates a new technique
   for using nanoparticles as contrast agents mixed with proppants that can
   enhance borehole geophysical measurements, such as magnetic
   susceptibility, thereby improving the near-wellbore detection of prop
   pants in hydraulic fractures. The methods used in this paper include
   both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The experimental
   approach consists of (a) synthesizing paramagnetic nanoparticles and (b)
   carrying out a series of magnetic susceptibility core logging
   measurements, in the presence of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles
   (i.e., with a core/shell structure with size of 60-70 nm) mixed with
   proppants. Numerical simulations are performed simultaneously to confirm
   that the nanoparticles remain concentrated in hydraulic fractures as is
   demonstrated in the experimental work. We developed a two-phase flow
   model to investigate the spatial distribution of nanoparticles when they
   are injected into a hydraulically fractured porous media, in which the
   hydraulic fractures are filled with propping agents. Furthermore, we
   used numerical simulations to investigate the effects of heterogeneity
   as well as rock and fracture properties on spatial distribution of
   nanoparticles in the porous media.
   The results of laboratory experiments showed that the relative
   enhancement of the volume susceptibility of the fractured zones depend
   on factors such as the type of proppants (e.g., magnetic versus
   nonmagnetic proppants), the concentration of nanoparticles in the
   injected solution, and the volume of nanoparticle solution and
   proppants. The use of magnetic nanoparticles lead to a significant
   enhancement in the detection of fractures, even with widths as small as
   0.3 cm. The numerical simulations on synthetic examples show that the
   nanoparticle concentration in hydraulic fractures is significantly
   higher than that in the surrounding porous rock in the case of tight
   formations. We have then illustrated from the experimental and numerical
   methods that the superparamagnetic nanoparticles, which are mainly
   concentrated in the fractures can be used as contrast agents mixed with
   the proppants to highlight the fractures and detect the location of
   proppants. This detection technique can be applied in the field by using
   the borehole magnetic susceptibility tools for pre-fracturing and
   post-fracturing measurements in open-hole wells. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Experiments in the context of block copolymer electrolyte materials have
   observed intriguing dependence of the ionic conductivities upon the
   polymer molecular weight and the degree of segregation between the
   blocks. Such results have been partly rationalized by invoking the
   spatial extent of dynamical inhomogeneities that manifest in ordered
   phases of block copolymers comprised of a rubbery and a glassy block.
   Motivated by such observations, we use molecular dynamics simulations to
   study the extent of spatial inhomogeneities in segmental dynamics of
   lamellar diblock copolymer systems where the blocks possess different
   mobilities. We probed the local average relaxation times and the
   dynamical heterogeneities as a function of distance from the interface.
   Our results suggest that the relaxation times of rubbery segments are
   strongly influenced by both the spatial proximity to the interface and
   the relative mobility of the glassy segments. Scaling of our results
   indicate that the interfacial width of the ordered phases serves as the
   length scale underlying the spatial inhomogeneities in segmental
   dynamics of the fast monomers. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In recent works, we demonstrated the achievement of bicontinuous
   donor/acceptor morphologies by the addition of conjugated block
   copolymers to a blend of conjugated homopolymer donors and fullerene
   acceptors. However, the domain sizes resulting in experiments were much
   larger than those of interest for high-performance organic solar cells.
   Moreover, a significant concentration of fullerene acceptors was present
   in the donor domains. Here, we utilize simulations to study the
   bicontinuous donor/acceptor morphologies that result for different
   parametric conditions. Using such results, we provide guidelines for how
   to blend polymer materials to give rise to bicontinuous phases with the
   smaller and more compositionally pure domains that are desirable for
   organic photovoltaic applications. Our results can be generalized to
   treat a large range of donor and acceptor monomers. (C) 2016 Wiley

Volume = {{157}},

Abstract = {{For unconventional resources exploration and development, hydraulic
   fracture pattern and associated dimensions are critical in determining
   well stimulation efficiency and ultimate recovery. When creating arrays
   of hydraulic fractures along horizontal wells, stress field changes
   induced by hydraulic fractures themselves can lead to fracture
   interference and coalescence. The resulting complex fracture geometry
   may compromise or improve the effectiveness of the stimulation job,
   depending on the nature of the context. Currently, the prevailing
   approach for hydraulic fracture modeling also relies on Linear Elastic
   Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), which uses stress intensity factor at the
   fracture tip as fracture propagation criteria. Even though LEFM can
   predict hard rock hydraulic fracturing processes reasonably, but often
   fails to give accurate predictions of fracture geometry and propagation
   pressure in quasi -brittle and ductile rocks, such as poorly
   consolidated sands and clay-rich shales. In this study, a fully coupled
   hydraulic fracture propagation model based on the Extended Finite
   Element Method (XFEM), Cohesive Zone Method (CZM) and Mohr-Coulomb
   theory of plasticity is presented, to investigate the interference and
   coalescence of fluid -driven hydraulic fractures that initiated from
   horizontal wells. The results indicate that fracture spacing and the
   relative timing of fracture initiation control whether the fractures
   compete against each other to form a divergent pattern or coalesce into
   a single, primary fracture. Fracture growth can be arrested after
   fracture tips pass by when simultaneously fracturing adjacent horizontal
   wells. Even though the in-elastic rock deformation due to shear failure
   can strongly impact fracture geometry and fracturing pressure, it has
   limited influence on hydraulic fracture interaction patterns. (C) 2016

Title = {{Onto resolving spurious wave reflection problem with changing

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{86-122}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this work an effective method was proposed in order to resolve the
   wave reflection problems between local/nonlocal models as well as
   multiple nonlocal models with varying nonlocality. Spurious wave
   reflection has been a primary concern in developing a robust
   multiscale-multiresolution model. In the current work a power-law based
   nonlocal peridynamic model has been proposed in order to mitigate this
   issue in a versatile manner. The fractional power-law eliminates the
   spurious wave reflection at the interfaces between local/nonlocal
   regions or regions with different nonlocalities. By controlling the
   exponent of the power-law it is possible to vary the frequency
   components of short or long waves without requiring a large handshake
   region. Using this underlying idea, 1/vertical bar x-x'vertical
   bar(1+alpha), for all 0 < alpha < 2 can be used as a kernel function in
   order to define nonlocal interaction between x and x'. It was shown that
   by controlling alpha it is possible to change the nature of nonlocal
   interaction within any given cutoff range. Besides power law, Gaussian
   kernel is another good choice in minimizing the wave reflection issue.
   However, Gaussian function has some limitations with large variation in
   nonlocality or waves with higher frequency. In that context the proposed
   model demonstrated its effectiveness by removing any spurious wave
   reflections originated in various cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Today's fast-changing markets often require the granularity of
   production schedules to be refined to time scales comparable to the time
   constants of a chemical process. Consequently, the process dynamics must
   be considered explicitly in production scheduling. High dimensionality,
   nonlinearity, and the associated computational complexity make
   incorporating dynamic models in scheduling calculations challenging. We
   propose a novel scheduling approach based on scheduling-oriented
   low-order dynamic models identified from historical process operating
   data. We introduce a methodology for selecting scheduling-relevant
   variables and identify empirical models that capture their dynamic
   response to production target changes imposed at the scheduling level.
   The optimal scheduling calculation is then formulated as a dynamic
   optimization aimed at minimizing operating cost. We apply these concepts
   to an industrial-size model of an air separation unit operating under
   time-sensitive electricity prices. Our approach reduces computational
   effort considerably while preserving essential information required for
   the optimal schedule to be feasible from a dynamic point of view.
   Extensive simulations show that significant savings can be derived from
   operating in a transient regime, where the production rate is increased
   when energy prices are low, and reduced during peak price periods, while
   taking advantage of available storage capacity.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 capture by absorption using amine solvents has the potential to
   significantly reduce the CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel power plants.
   One of the major costs of this technology is the energy required for
   solvent regeneration. Complex process configurations claim to have
   promising potential to reduce the energy required for solvent
   regeneration. In this work, the effect of flow-sheet complexity is
   explored by studying two advanced stripping flow sheets: an advanced
   flash stripper and an advanced reboiled stripper. Both advanced
   configurations recover the stripping steam heat by means of a heat
   integration comprised of cold- and warm-rich solvent bypasses. The
   advanced configurations are simulated and optimized in Aspen Plus V.8.4
   using 7 m monoethanolamine (MEA) with lean loading from 0.15 to 0.38
   (mol CO2/mol MEA). The rich loading associated with each lean loading is
   determined by simulating the absorber providing 90\% capture from flue
   gas with 4 mol \% CO2, typical of a natural gas-fired turbine. The
   results are compared to a simple stripper in terms of total equivalent
   work. Both the advanced reboiled stripper and the advanced flash
   stripper require 12\% less equivalent work than a simple stripper. The
   associated cold-rich and warm-rich bypasses for the optimum cases are,
   respectively, 20\% and 50\% for the advanced reboiled stripper and 15\%
   and 35\% for the advanced flash stripper.}},

Abstract = {{Tight integration between the amine scrubbing plant, coal-fired power
   plant, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) facility creates process design
   and control challenges for post-combustion CO2 capture. A dynamic model
   of an advanced amine scrubbing process and a steady state model of a 550
   MWe power plant were used to examine four bounding cases that represent
   different system components dominating the regulatory process control
   strategy. Satisfying the operational and economic objectives of one
   system component resulted in unfavorable dynamic performance for the
   remainder of the system. When a step change decrease occurred in either
   the CO2 delivery rate from the capture plant to the EOR facility or the
   steam extraction rate from the power plant to the capture plant, more
   than 3 h was required for the amine plant to reach a new steady state.
   Attempting to control the CO2 removal rate from the flue gas can not be
   satisfactorily achieved through regulatory control alone. Controlling
   stripper temperature and pressure brought all manipulated variables to
   within 5\% of their final steady state value in less than 2 h in
   response to a decrease in power plant load. The design of process
   equipment, specifically the CO2 stripper and steam extraction valve,
   depends heavily on the desired process control strategy. The solvent
   surge tank should be placed in the flow of the rich solvent to allow for
   tighter control of absorber removal, although the difference in system
   performance between rich and lean surge tanks was found to be negligible
   when the surge tank inventory was small.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured conductive polymers have been widely researched for
   various applications such as energy storage and conversion,
   chemical/biological sensors, and biomedical devices. Recently, novel
   synthetic methods which adopt doping molecules as cross-linker have been
   developed to prepare conductive polymer gels (CPGs) with cross-linked
   network and 3D hierarchically porous nanostructures. The CPGs, as well
   as their derived carbon frameworks, exhibit high electrical
   conductivity, large surface area, structural tunability, and
   hierarchical porosity for rapid mass/charge transport, which contribute
   to their high performance when applied for energy storage and conversion
   devices. This Perspective highlights the key features of CPGs and their
   derived carbon frameworks, discusses their possibilities in terms of
   rational synthesis and energy related applications, and proposes future
   directions for their technological development.}},

Abstract = {{Background Whether catheter ablation (CA) is superior to amiodarone
   (AMIO) for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in
   patients with heart failure is unknown.
   Methods and Results This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group,
   multicenter study. Patients with persistent AF, dual-chamber implantable
   cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy
   defibrillator, New York Heart Association II to III, and left
   ventricular ejection fraction <40\% within the past 6 months were
   randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo CA for AF (group 1, n=102) or
   receive AMIO (group 2, n=101). Recurrence of AF was the primary end
   point. All-cause mortality and unplanned hospitalization were the
   secondary end points. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 24
   months. At the end of follow-up, 71 (70\%; 95\% confidence interval,
   60\%-78\%) patients in group 1 were recurrence free after an average of
   1.40.6 procedures in comparison with 34 (34\%; 95\% confidence interval,
   25\%-44\%) in group 2 (log-rank P<0.001). The success rate of CA in the
   different centers after a single procedure ranged from 29\% to 61\%.
   After adjusting for covariates in the multivariable model, AMIO therapy
   was found to be significantly more likely to fail (hazard ratio, 2.5;
   95\% confidence interval, 1.5-4.3; P<0.001) than CA. Over the 2-year
   follow-up, the unplanned hospitalization rate was (32 {[}31\%] in group
   1 and 58 {[}57\%] in group 2; P<0.001), showing 45\% relative risk
   reduction (relative risk, 0.55; 95\% confidence interval, 0.39-0.76). A
   significantly lower mortality was observed in CA (8 {[}8\%] versus AMIO
   (18 {[}18\%]; P=0.037).
   Conclusions This multicenter randomized study shows that CA of AF is
   superior to AMIO in achieving freedom from AF at long-term follow-up and
   reducing unplanned hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart
   failure and persistent AF.

Abstract = {{We propose the concept and design of a transparent, flexible, and
   self-powered wireless sensor comprising a graphene-based
   sensor/frequency-modulator circuitry and a graphene antenna. In this
   allgraphene device, the multilayered-graphene antenna receives the
   fundamental tone at C band and retransmits the frequency-modulated
   sensed signal (harmonic tone) at X band. The frequency orthogonality
   between the received/re-transmitted signals may enable high-performance
   sensing in severe interference/clutter background. Here, a fully
   passive, quad-ring frequency multiplier is proposed using graphene
   field-effect transistors, of which the unique ambipolar charge
   transports render a frequency doubling effect with conversion gain being
   chemically sensitive to exposed gas/molecular/chemical/infectious
   agents. This transparent, light-weight, and self-powered system may
   potentially benefit a number of wireless sensing and diagnosis
   applications, particularly for smart contact lenses/glasses and

Abstract = {{The influence of field emission of electrons from surfaces on the fast
   ionization wave (FIW) propagation in high-voltage nanosecond pulse
   discharge in the atmospheric-pressure nitrogen is studied by a
   one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Collisions model. A strong
   influence of field emission on the FIW dynamics and plasma parameters is
   obtained. Namely, the accounting for the field emission makes possible
   the bridging of the cathode-anode gap by rather dense plasma (similar to
   10(13) cm(-3)) in less than 1 ns. This is explained by the generation of
   runaway electrons from the field emitted electrons. These electrons are
   able to cross the entire gap pre-ionizing it and promoting the
   ionization wave propagation. We have found that the propagation of
   runaway electrons through the gap cannot be accompanied by the streamer
   propagation, because the runaway electrons align the plasma density
   gradients. In addition, we have obtained that the field enhancement
   factor allows controlling the speed of ionization wave propagation.

Abstract = {{We use atomistic simulations to probe the ion conductivities and
   mechanical properties of polyethylene oxide electrolytes containing
   Al2O3 nanoparticles. We specifically study the influence of repulsive
   polymer-nanoparticle and ion-nanoparticle interactions and compare the
   results with those reported for electrolytes containing the polymorph
   beta-Al2O3 nanoparticles. We observe that incorporating repulsive
   nanoparticle interactions generally results in increased ionic
   mobilities and decreased elastic moduli for the electrolyte. Our results
   indicate that both ion transport and mechanical properties are
   influenced by the polymer segmental dynamics in the interfacial zones of
   the nanoparticle in the ion-doped systems. Such effects were seen to be
   determined by an interplay between the nanoparticle-polymer,
   nanoparticle-ion, and ion-polymer interactions. In addition, such
   interactions were also observed to influence the number of dissociated
   ions and the resulting conductivities. Within the perspective of the
   influence of nanoparticles on the polymer relaxation times in ion-doped
   systems, our results in the context of viscoelastic properties were
   consistent with the ionic mobilities. Overall, our results serve to
   highlight some issues that confront the efforts to use nanoparticle
   dispersions to simultaneously enhance the conductivity and the

Abstract = {{A Zeno line is a straight line in a fluid's temperature-density plane
   where the compressibility factor equals unity and stretches from
   supercritical to subcritical regimes. A second unexpected linearity also
   occurs in liquids in their normal liquid range (NLR) where the
   compressibility factor approaches zero. This Zeno-like line includes
   liquids as diverse as monatomic and diatomic elements to hydrogen
   bonding liquids, with water and helium being the only currently known
   exceptions. Remarkably, this second linearity is also present in
   polymeric liquids, molten metals, and salts, i.e., it is a generic
   characteristic of liquids with negligible or low vapor pressures. This
   observation yields the following new corresponding states principle:
   Saturated liquid densities are a linear function of temperature in the
   NLR for molecular, polymeric, inorganic, ionic, and metallic liquids and
   superpose to form a single master curve. Another Zeno-like linearity in
   the NLR has also been identified for the configurational energy of many
   liquids. Extension of this line to zero temperature defines the ground
   state configurational energy of the hypothetical disordered liquid
   (glass).}},

   electron beam or gamma radiation. After the fabrics were dried and
   weighed to determine the degree of grafting (DoG), the presence of
   oxalate in the fabrics was verified using XPS. Zeta potential
   measurements showed the fabric surfaces to be negatively charged. The
   fabrics were tested by rotating them for 7 days in a rotary agitator
   with actual seawater spiked with 0.2 or 1.0 mg.L-1 uranium. The fraction
   of uranium in the solution which was removed due to uptake on the
   fabrics was found to rise with increasing DoG at both uranium
   concentrations. EDS measurements were used to map the distribution of
   adsorbed uranium on the polymeric fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Alkaline conditioning of the amidoxime based adsorbents is a significant
   step in the preparation of the adsorbent for uranium uptake from
   seawater. The effects of various alkaline conditioning parameters such
   as the type of alkaline reagent, reaction temperature, and reaction time
   were investigated with respect to uranium adsorption capacity from
   simulated seawater (spiked with 8 ppm uranium) and natural seawater
   (from Sequim Bay, WA). An adsorbent (AF1) was prepared at the Oak Ridge
   National Laboratory by radiation-induced graft polymerization (RIGP)
   with acrylonitrile and itaconic acid onto high-surface area polyethylene
   fibers. For the AF1 adsorbent, sodium hydroxide emerged as a better
   reagent for alkaline conditioning over potassium hydroxide, which has
   typically been used in previous studies, because of higher uranium
   uptake capacity and lower cost over the other candidate alkaline
   reagents investigated in this study. Use of sodium hydroxide in place of
   potassium hydroxide is shown to result in a 21-30\% decrease in the cost
   of uranium recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to optimize the design and deployment
   conditions utilized by a technology for passively collecting uranium
   from seawater in order to achieve the minimum uranium production cost.
   Given the complicated empirically driven nature of the cost calculation,
   which uses discounted cash flow techniques to follow the life cycle
   costs of a unit mass of adsorbent, the cost calculation tool is treated
   as a black box model, and thus the minimization employs a derivative
   free optimization method, chosen to be the Nelder-Mead simplex method.
   By use of an illustrative base case, the uranium production cost is
   minimized, resulting in a 20\% savings. From there, sensitivity analyses
   are considered in order to provide insight as to how the optimal
   deployment conditions are determined and to shed light on significant
   cost drivers. It is determined that optimizing the deployment conditions
   and improving the uranium binding kinetics can significantly decrease
   production cost. The results presented in this paper can inform the
   direction of future research. Furthermore, as the technology continues
   to evolve, the methodology developed for this optimization will remain
   relevant and the optimization can continue to be used to guide design
   and R\&D decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Lipid rafts are thought to be key organizers of membrane protein
   complexes in cells. Many proteins that interact with rafts have bulky
   polymeric components such as intrinsically disordered protein domains
   and polysaccharide chains. Therefore, understanding the interaction
   between membrane domains and membrane-bound polymers provides insights
   into the roles rafts play in cells. Multiple studies have demonstrated
   that high concentrations of membrane-bound polymeric domains create
   significant lateral steric pressure at membrane surfaces. Furthermore,
   our recent work has shown that lateral steric pressure at membrane
   surfaces opposes the assembly of membrane domains. Building on these
   findings, here we report that membrane-bound polymers are potent
   suppressors of membrane phase separation, which can destabilize lipid
   domains with substantially greater efficiency than globular domains such
   as membrane-bound proteins. Specifically, we created giant vesicles with
   a ternary lipid composition, which separated into coexisting liquid
   ordered and disordered phases. Lipids with saturated tails and
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains conjugated to their head groups were
   included at increasing molar concentrations. When these lipids were
   sparse on the membrane surface they partitioned to the liquid ordered
   phase. However, as they became more concentrated, the fraction of GUVs
   that were phase-separated decreased dramatically, ultimately yielding a
   population of homogeneous membrane vesicles. Experiments and physical
   modeling using compositions of increasing PEG molecular weight and lipid
   miscibility phase transition temperature demonstrate that longer
   polymers are the most efficient suppressors of membrane phase separation
   when the energetic barrier to lipid mixing is low. In contrast, as the
   miscibility transition temperature increases, longer polymers are more
   readily driven out of domains by the increased steric pressure.
   Therefore, the concentration of shorter polymers required to suppress
   phase separation decreases relative to longer polymers. Collectively,
   our results demonstrate that crowded, membrane bound polymers are highly
   efficient suppressors of phase separation and suggest that the ability
   of lipid domains to resist steric pressure depends on both their lipid
   composition and the size and concentration of the membrane-bound
   polymers they incorporate.}},

Title = {{Formation and effect of orientation domains in layered oxide cathodes of

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},

Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{264-270}},

Abstract = {{We show that in layered oxides that are employed as cathodes in
   lithium-ion batteries, the cation layers can order on different
   \{111\}(Nacl) planes within a single particle, which makes the lithium
   layer discontinuous across a particle. The findings challenge previous
   assertions that lithium undergoes 2-D diffusion in layered oxides and
   the data provide new insights into the decrease in rate capabilities for
   some layered oxides. Therefore, it is critically important to understand
   how these discontinuities form and how the loss of 2-D diffusion impacts
   the overall performance of the layered oxide cathode materials.
   Employing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and aberration-corrected scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we find that as the material
   transitions from a disordered to an ordered state, it forms four
   orientation variants corresponding to the four \{111\}(Nacl) planes.
   This transition is not intrinsic to all layered oxides and appears to be
   more strongly affected by nickel. Furthermore, with energy dispersive
   spectroscopy (EDS), we show that there is an increase in the nickel
   concentration at the interface between each orientation variant. This
   reduces the rate of lithium diffusion, negatively affects the rate
   capability, and could be contributing to the overall capacity fade.

Abstract = {{The extended scaled boundary finite element method (X-SBFEM) based on
   the level set method (LSM) is proposed in this paper to combine the
   advantages of the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) and the
   extended finite element method (XFEM). The level set method (LSM)
   algorithm is applied to further develop the X-SBFEM, especially for the
   crack propagation problem. The Heaviside enrichment function is used to
   represent a jump across a discontinuity surface in a split element, and
   the non-smooth behavior around the crack tip is described using the
   semi-analytical SBFEM. The stiffness of the region containing the crack
   tip is computed directly, and the generalized stress intensity factors
   of many types of singularities are obtained directly from their
   definitions using consistent formulas. In the numerical simulations, a
   square plate with an edge crack under tension, a three-point bending
   beam, a four point shear beam and a dam (the Koyna dam) with a single
   propagating crack are modeled. The results show that the proposed
   X-SBFEM is capable of calculating the stress intensity factors of cracks
   and predicting crack trajectories and load-displacement relations
   accurately. An analysis of the sensitivity of the parameters is employed
   to demonstrate that various mesh densities and crack propagation step
   lengths led to consistent results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We study mathematical and computational models for computing the
   deformation of fiber-reinforced polymers due to external forces. A
   thorough study requires an understanding of both micro-structural
   effects and uncertainty/variability in the manufacturing process, such
   as uncertainty in the size and distribution of fibers and variability in
   material properties and fracture parameters. We first show that the
   present uncertainties/variabilities, which are of both random and
   non-random types, cannot be accurately characterized by current
   stochastic multiscale models based on precise probability theory, such
   as stationary random fields. Next, we present a new hybrid
   fuzzy-stochastic model, which can more accurately describe
   uncertainties/variabilities in fiber composites. The new model, which is
   referred to as a fuzzy-stationary random field, consists of a random
   field with fuzzy moments. We then construct a global-local multiscale
   algorithm in a fuzzy-stochastic framework for efficiently computing
   output quantities of interest, such as displacements and stresses, in
   regions of relatively small size, e.g. hot spots. The algorithm utilizes
   the concept of representative volume elements and homogenization and
   constructs a global solution to compute a local approximation that
   captures the microscale features of the problem. The results are based
   on and backed by real experimental data through a calibration-validation

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been identified as extremely promising
   candidates for gas capture and storage. Therefore, an understanding of
   the adsorption mechanisms is crucial to the improvement of CNT
   applications. In this work, grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations and
   analytical models are used to study, at the temperature of T = 303 K,
   the adsorption and condensation of SO2 in hexagonal arrays of
   double-walled CNTs of different inner nanotube radii R-in and intertube
   distances d. For both the inner and the outer adsorption, type I and
   type IV adsorption isotherms (IUPAC classification) are observed; they
   can be described adequately by analytical models. At a given pressure,
   the maximum adsorption among different CNT geometries depends strongly
   on the applied pressure. For the inner adsorption, three stages of
   adsorption are identified with increasing pressures. At low pressures,
   only one monolayer is formed, where the adsorption energy dominates the
   adsorption. At intermediate and high pressures, multilayers are formed
   until finally condensation is achieved; now it is the surface area or
   the available volume per CNT mass unit that dominates the adsorption.
   The nonlinear dependence of the outer adsorption on R-in and d can be
   explained by similar arguments as adopted for the inner adsorption. The
   effective number density of SO2 molecules and isosteric heat of
   adsorption are also analyzed to deepen our understanding of the
   adsorption behavior.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH IN THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new formulation for integrating over smooth curves and
   surfaces that are described by their closest point mappings. Our method
   is designed for curves and surfaces that are not defined by any explicit
   parameterization and is intended to be used in combination with level
   set techniques. However, contrary to the common practice with level set
   methods, the volume integrals derived from our formulation coincide
   exactly with the surface or line integrals that one wishes to compute.
   We study various aspects of this formulation and provide a geometric
   interpretation of this formulation in terms of the singular values of
   the Jacobian matrix of the closest point mapping. Additionally, we
   extend the formulation-initially derived to integrate over manifolds of
   codimension one-to include integration along curves in three dimensions.
   Some numerical examples using very simple discretizations are presented
   to demonstrate the efficacy of the formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Invasin is a key adhesin displayed on the outer membrane of Yersinia
   enterocolitica and Y pseudotuberculosis that mediates the initial stages
   of infection. Invasin specifically targets microfold (M) cells in the
   small intestine by binding beta(1) integrins and is sufficient to
   trigger eukaryotic uptake of invasin-coated particles, including
   Yersinia, Escherichia coli, and latex beads. As a result, invasin has
   generated interest to mediate oral delivery of vaccines and other
   biologics. Integrin binding affinity has been shown to correlate with
   particle uptake; thus we hypothesized that invasin variants with higher
   affinity would confer enhanced internalization. We first performed
   alanine scanning of surface-exposed tyrosine residues to identify those
   contributing to integrin binding. We identified two residues, which,
   when substituted with alanine, reduced binding to soluble
   alpha(5)beta(1), integrin. Next, we constructed four targeted
   mutagenesis libraries spanning these and other residues known to
   contribute to binding, followed by enrichment of variants able to
   mediate Caco-2 cellular invasion and to bind soluble alpha(5)beta(1)
   integrin. We identified three amino acid substitutions that increased
   alpha(5)beta(1) integrin binding affinity as measured by flow cytonietry
   and ELISA assays, two of which created a novel RGD motif surrounding the
   D911 residue critical for binding. This variant confers enhanced
   internalization into CHO cells but not Caco-2 cells when expressed on
   the E. coli surface. Further analysis showed that inclusion of an RGD
   expands invasin-integrin specificity, thereby impacting cellular
   selectivity. This work provides a molecular explanation for the lack of
   an RGD motif in invasin that is present in many other adhesins.}},

Abstract = {{We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the normal mode dynamics
   and frequency dependent dielectric relaxation spectra of diblock
   copolymers in lamellar phases. In contrast to previous works which have
   relied on the applicability of Rouse modes, we effect an explicit
   normal-mode analysis of the chain dynamics in the ordered phases in the
   directions parallel and perpendicular to the lamellar plane. We
   considered two models to isolate the specific effects arising from the
   morphological ordering and mobility disparities between the blocks. For
   systems with no mobility disparity between the blocks, our analysis
   demonstrates that both the normal modes and their relaxation dynamics in
   the planes parallel and perpendicular to the lamella exhibit deviations
   from the Rouse modes. For systems in which the mobility of one of the
   blocks was frozen in the lamellar phase, the normal modes closely
   resembled the Rouse modes for tethered polymers. However, the relaxation
   dynamics of such modes exhibited deviations from expectations for
   tethered chains. The changes in the normal mode dynamics manifest as
   shifts and broadening of the normal dielectric spectra. Together, our
   results serve to clarify the dielectric spectra effects resulting from
   the ordering of diblock copolymers into self-assembled morphologies.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur batteries with a high energy density are being considered
   a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage. However,
   realization of Li-S batteries is plagued by poor sulfur utilization due
   to the shuttle of intermediate lithiation products between electrodes
   and its dynamic redistribution. To optimize the sulfur utilization, an
   understanding of its redox behavior is essential. Herein, we report a
   gel cathode consisting of a polysulfide-impregnated O- and N-doped
   porous carbon and an independent, continuous, and highly conducting
   3-dimensional graphite film as the charge-transfer network. This design
   decouples the function of electron conduction and polysulfide
   absorption, which is beneficial for understanding the sulfur redox
   behavior and identifying the dominant factors leading to cell failure
   when the cells have high sulfur content and insufficient electrolyte.
   This design also opens up new prospects of tuning the properties of Li-S
   batteries via separately designing the material functions of electron
   conduction and polysulfide absorption.}},

   unusual properties. As opposed to their linear counterparts, these
   nonlinear states decay to a plateau of nonzero amplitude inside the

   distribution in centrifugal spinning of photocurable monomers}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{102-111}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the key factors for controlling the average fiber
   diameter and diameter distribution of fibers made via simultaneous
   centrifugal spinning and UV initiated polymerization are elucidated.
   Through systematic investigation, it was found that the average fiber
   diameter has a strong dependence on monomer delivery rate through the
   orifice, which can be intuitively linked to both the orifice diameter
   and monomer mixture viscosity. On the other hand, the breadth of the
   fiber diameter distribution can be controlled by the spin speed of the
   rotating spinneret. Carefully tuning these process parameters allows
   near independent control of average fiber diameter and its distribution,
   which could provide access to a widely tailorable range of fibers
   appropriate for different applications. Finally, under optimized process
   conditions, crosslinked fibers with average diameters of approximately
   1.5 mu m can be produced, which are one to two orders of magnitude
   smaller than photocured fibers fabricated in previous reports and
   comparable with the smallest melt blown nonwoven fibers produced
   commercially. Coupled with the advantages of cross-linked fibers made by
   in-situ photopolymerization, the capability to produce small fibers with
   tailored diameter distributions by centrifugal spinning could further
   establish this technology as a competitive alternative to existing
   approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aggregation kinetics of nC(60) and higher order fullerene (HOF)
   clusters, i.e., nC(70), nC(76), and nC(84), was systematically studied
   under a wide range of mono- (NaCl) and divalent (CaCl2) electrolytes and
   using time-resolved dynamic light scattering. Suwanee River Humic Acid
   (SRHA) was also used to determine the effect of natural macromolecules
   on nHOF aggregation. An increase in electrolyte concentration resulted
   in electrical double-layer compression of the negatively charged
   fullerene clusters, and the nC(60)s and nHOFs alike displayed classical
   Derjaguin Landau Verwey Overbeek (DLVO) type interaction. The critical
   coagulation concentration (CCC) displayed a strong negative correlation
   with the carbon number in fullerenes and was estimated as 220, 150, 100,
   and 70 mM NaCl and 10, 12, 6, and 7.5 mM CaCl2 for nC(60), nC(70),
   nC(76), and nC(84), respectively. The aggregation mechanisiin. (i.e.,
   van der Waals interaction domination) was enumerated via molecular
   dynamics simulation and modified DLVO model. The presence of SRHA. (2.5
   mg TOC/L) profoundly influenced the aggregation behavior by stabilizing
   all fullerene clusters, even at a 100 mM NaCl concentration. The results
   from this study can be utilized to predict aggregation kinetics of nHOF
   clusters other than the ones studied here. The scaling factor for van
   der Waals interaction can also be used to model nHOF duster interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Wide-scale exploitation of renewable energy requires low-cost efficient
   energy storage devices. The use of metal-free, inexpensive redox-active
   organic materials represents a promising direction for
   environmental-friendly, cost-effective sustainable energy storage. To
   this end, a liquid battery is designed using hydroquinone (H(2)BQ)
   aqueous solution as catholyte and graphite in aprotic electrolyte as
   anode. The working potential can reach 3.4V, with specific capacity of
   395mAhg(-1) and stable capacity retention about 99.7\% per cycle. Such
   high potential and capacity is achieved using only C, H and O atoms as
   building blocks for redox species, and the replacement of Li metal with
   graphite anode can circumvent potential safety issues. As H(2)BQ can be
   extracted from biomass directly and its redox reaction mimics the
   bio-electrochemical process of quinones in nature, using such a
   bio-inspired organic compound in batteries enables access to greener and
   more sustainable energy-storage technology.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, two types of ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   chloride (BMIMCl) and ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate
   (EMIMAc), were used as recyclable solvents for dissolving raw cellulose
   in the spinning of micron- and nano-scale regenerated cellulose fiber.
   The approach for preparing the cellulose solution using these ionic
   liquids is described. A comparative study was also conducted on
   cellulose solubility, the spinning method, and cellulose fiber
   properties produced with each solvent. The experimental fibers are
   characterized in terms of fiber diameter, strength, thermal property,
   crystallinity, and content of solvent residual, using tensile test,
   thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, and mass spectrometry. The study concluded that there was a
   significant difference in the tensile strength, but not in the
   elongation and modulus of the fibers regenerated from BMIMCl and EMIMAc.
   For crystal size, crystal orientation, and crystallinaty index, the
   BMIMCl-generated fiber had higher values than the EMIMAc-regenerated
   fiber. For the thermal property, EMIMAc fiber was more stable at higher
   temperatures than BMIMCl fiber. It was also revealed that the EMIMAc
   fiber had significantly less solvent residual content than the BMIMCl
   fiber.}},

Abstract = {{An instability in the stable operation of microdischarges sustained at

   microplasma. For an operating frequency of 9 GHz, and electrode gap of
   60 mu m, the field emission (FE) is not active at the breakdown voltage.
   However, once a stable dense plasma is produced post-breakdown, a strong

   for FE causing a runaway in the electron generation in the plasma.}},

Abstract = {{Production from shale-gas reservoirs plays an important role in
   natural-gas supply in the United States. Horizontal drilling and
   multistage hydraulic fracturing are the two key enabling technologies
   for the economic development of these shale-gas reservoirs. It is
   believed that gas in shale reservoirs is mainly composed of free gas
   within fractures and pores and adsorbed gas in organic matter (kerogen).
   It is generally assumed in the literature that the monolayer Langmuir
   isotherm describes gas-adsorption behavior in shale-gas reservoirs.
   However, in this work, we analyzed four experimental measurements of
   methane adsorption from the Marcellus Shale core samples that deviate
   from the Langmuir isotherm, but obey the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   isotherm. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to find
   that methane adsorption in a shale-gas reservoir behaves similar to
   multilayer adsorption. Consequently, investigation of this specific
   gas-desorption effect is important for accurate evaluation of well
   performance and completion effectiveness in shale-gas reservoirs on the
   basis of the BET isotherm. The difference in calculating original gas in
   place (OGIP) on the basis of both isotherms is discussed. We also
   performed history matching with one production well from the Marcellus
   Shale and evaluated the contribution of gas desorption to the well's
   performance. History matching shows that gas adsorption obeying the BET
   isotherm contributes more to overall gas recovery than gas adsorption
   obeying the Langmuir isotherm, especially at early time in production.
   This work provides better understanding of gas desorption in shale-gas
   reservoirs and updates our current analytical and numerical models for
   simulation of shale-gas production.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of condensate in fractures is one of the challenges of
   producing gas from gas/condensate reservoirs. When the bottomhole
   pressure drops to less than the dewpoint, condensate forms in and around
   fractures and causes a significant drop in the gas relative
   permeability, which leads to a decline in the gas-production rate. This
   reduction of gas productivity is in addition to the reduction because of
   water blocking by the fracturing water. Solvents can be used to remove
   liquid blocks and increase gas- and condensate-production rates. In this
   paper, dimethyl ether (DME) is introduced as a novel solvent for this
   purpose. In addition to good partitioning into condensate/gas/aqueous
   phases, DME has a high vapor pressure, which improves the flowback after
   the treatment. We compare its behavior with both methanol (MeOH) and
   ethanol (EtOH) solvents.}},

   nineteenth century and the rate of rise may be increasing. Several
   studies that attempt to explain the long-term trend of GMSL during the
   instrumental record share the common assumption that this trend is
   deterministic in nature and different from natural variations. Here we
   show that the trend can alternatively be explained, at least in part, as
   being caused by random variations within the coupled
   ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere system, and hence not having a deterministic
   origin. These random trends, which add to externally forced changes
   (e.g., through anthropogenic climate change), are a consequence of the
   integrated character of GMSL, which is the cumulative addition of
   temporal contributions that exhibit random character, and whose
   integration results in GMSL variations with persistence on
   decadal-centennial time scales. The generation of trends by integration
   of random stationary noise (i.e., even in a constant climate) is a
   robust and fundamental feature of stochastically forced systems with
   memory. The integrated character of GMSL results in an intrinsic
   difficulty in distinguishing internal from externally forced trends.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, unstructured grids have been a very important step
   in the development of petroleum reservoir simulators. In fact, the
   so-called third generation simulators are based on Perpendicular
   Bisection (PEBI) unstructured grids. Nevertheless, the use of PEBI grids
   is not very general when full anisotropic reservoirs are modeled.
   Another possibility is the use of the Element based Finite Volume Method
   (EbFVM). This approach has been tested for several reservoir types and
   in principle has no limitation in application. In this paper, we
   implement this approach in an in-house simulator called UTCOMP using
   four element types: hexahedron, tetrahedron, prism, and pyramid. UTCOMP
   is a compositional, multiphase/multicomponent simulator based on an
   Implicit Pressure Explicit Composition (IMPEC) approach designed to
   handle several hydrocarbon recovery processes. All properties, except
   permeability and porosity, are evaluated in each grid vertex. In this
   work, four case studies were selected to evaluate the implementation,
   two of them involving irregular geometries. Results are shown in terms
   of oil and gas rates and saturated gas field.}},

Abstract = {{Approximate computing trades off accuracy of results for resources such
   as energy or computing time. There is a large and rapidly growing
   literature on approximate computing that has focused mostly on showing
   the benefits of approximate computing. However, we know relatively
   little about how to control approximation in a disciplined way.
   In this paper, we address the problem of controlling approximation for
   non-streaming programs that have a set of ``knobs{''} that can be dialed
   up or down to control the level of approximation of different components
   in the program. We formulate this control problem as a constrained
   optimization problem, and describe a system called Capri that uses
   machine learning to learn cost and error models for the program, and
   uses these models to determine, for a desired level of approximation,
   knob settings that optimize metrics such as running time or energy
   usage. Experimental results with complex benchmarks from different
   problem domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Mudrocks and shales contain pores within the size range of 2-100 nm.
   Flow of supercritical gas in these pores at reservoir
   pressure-temperature conditions falls within the slip-flow and early
   transition-flow regime (0.001 < Kn < 1.0). Currently, the description of
   supercritical gas flow in these flow regimes is mostly limited to simple
   tube and channel geometries that are of limited applicability to the
   sponge-like or platy nanoporous geometry in organic matter or clays.
   Here, we present a local-effective-viscosity multi-relaxation-time
   lattice Boltzmann model (LEV-LBM) designed to simulate gas flow in the
   slip- and early-transition-flow regimes in complex geometries. The
   LEV-LBM is informed with local effective viscosities at each node to
   capture the variance of the mean free path of gas molecules in a bounded
   system. The corrected mean free path for each lattice node is determined
   using a three-dimensional wall function adaptable to complex pore
   geometries. To enforce a non-zero slip velocity at solid boundaries, a
   combined diffusive bounce-back scheme is applied to the pore-walls. The
   LEV-LBM is first validated in simple tube geometries, where good
   agreement is found for Knudsen numbers up to 1.0. We then use the
   LEV-LBM to quantify the finite tube length effect and comment on the
   implications for pore-network models. We finally demonstrate the utility
   of the LEV-LBM by simulating pure methane flow in digital
   reconstructions of nanoporous organic matter at reservoir conditions,
   and compare the results to bundle of tubes models. We show that the
   bundle of tubes models overestimate apparent permeability by factors
   between 1.52 and 153, due to the non-trivial dependence of flow on pore
   space connectivity and shape. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Robotic hands are typically too rigid to react against unexpected
   impacts and disturbances in order to prevent damage. Human hands have
   great versatility and robustness due, in part, to the passive compliance
   at the hand joints. In this paper, we present a novel design for joint
   with passive compliance that is inspired by biomechanical properties of
   the human hands. The design consists of a compliant material and a set
   of pulleys that rotate and stretch the material as the joint rotates. We
   created six different compliant materials, and we optimized the joint
   design to match the desired humanlike compliance. We present two design
   features that allow for the tuning of the joint torque profile, namely,
   a pretension mechanism to increase pretension of the compliant material,
   and a design of varying pulley configuration. We built a prototype for
   the new joint by using additive manufacturing to fabricate the design
   components and built a test-bed with a force sensor and a servo motor.
   Experimental results show that the joint exhibits a nonlinear, double
   exponential joint compliance with all six compliant materials. The
   design feature involving variable pulley configurations is effective in
   adjusting the slope of joint torque during the joint rotation while the
   pretension mechanism showed only a limited effect on increasing the
   torque amplitude. Overall, with its small size, light weight, low
   friction, and humanlike joint compliance, the presented joint design is
   ready for implementation in robotic hands.}},

   or a responsive interfacial surface to patterned radiation, precise
   control over placement, orientation, alignment, and selective

Abstract = {{We propose an approach to synthesize control protocols for autonomous
   systems that account for uncertainties and imperfections in interactions
   with human operators. As an illustrative example, we consider a scenario
   involving road network surveillance by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   that is controlled remotely by a human operator but also has a certain
   degree of autonomy. Depending on the type (i.e., probabilistic and/or
   nondeterministic) of knowledge about the uncertainties and imperfections
   in the human-automation interactions, we use abstractions based on
   Markov decision processes and augment these models to stochastic
   two-player games. Our approach enables the synthesis of
   operator-dependent optimal mission plans for the UAV, highlighting the
   effects of operator characteristics (e.g., workload, proficiency, and
   fatigue) on UAV mission performance. It can also provide informative
   feedback (e.g., Pareto curves showing the trade-offs between multiple
   mission objectives), potentially assisting the operator in
   decision-making. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via a
   detailed UAV mission planning case study.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the problem of
   synthesizing operator-dependent optimal mission plans for unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs) that take into account a variety of operator
   performance characteristics (e.g., workload, proficiency, and fatigue).
   While the proposed approach is demonstrated in the domain of
   human-automation UAV mission planning, in general it can be applied
   towards the design of control protocols (i.e., behaviors taken in
   response to external inputs) for any autonomous system that interacts
   with human operators. The benefit of this approach is that it directly
   considers human factors in the synthesis of autonomous control
   protocols, while existing approaches either synthesize control protocols
   without considering human factors or treat human-automation interactions
   as a post-design concern. In order to take human factors into
   consideration, the proposed approach uses abstractions that represent
   the effects of human performance characteristics on human-automation
   interactions. These abstractions are then integrated with formal models
   of the autonomous system under consideration, and reactive synthesis
   techniques are applied to generate autonomous control protocols given a
   specification for overall performance. To demonstrate this concept, we:
   1) develop an example scenario based on a UAV road surveillance mission;
   2) propose a hypothetical model for human operator behavior and
   performance that takes into account characteristics such as workload,
   proficiency, and fatigue; and 3) synthesize UAV control protocols and
   perform numerical experiments using tools for probabilistic model
   checking and two-player stochastic games. Based on the example scenario
   and hypothetical human model, experimental results suggest that this
   approach may be feasible for synthesizing control protocols for
   autonomous systems that account for uncertainties and imperfections in
   interactions with human operators.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an overlay device-to-device network, where each
   multiple-antenna transmitter sends data to a designated single-antenna
   receiver by using maximum ratio transmission based on limited feedback,

   We obtain a lower bound on the optimum number of feedback bits that
   maximizes net spectral efficiency, capturing the overall system gain of
   using limited feedback. Our main finding is that the optimum number of
   feedback bits scales linearly with the number of transmit antennas and
   logarithmically with the channel coherence time and the inverse of the

Abstract = {{The powerful tools of transformation optics (TO) allow an effective
   distortion of a region of space by carefully engineering the material
   inhomogeneity and anisotropy, and have been successfully applied in
   recent years to control electromagnetic fields in many different
   scenarios, e.g., to realize invisibility cloaks and planar lenses. For
   various field transformations, it is not necessary to use volumetric
   inhomogeneous materials, and suitably designed ultrathin metasurfaces
   with tailored spatial or spectral responses may be able to realize
   similar functionalities within smaller footprints and more robust
   mechanisms. Here, inspired by the concept of metamaterial TO lenses, we
   discuss field transformations enabled by parity-time (PT) symmetric
   metasurfaces, which can emulate negative refraction. We first analyze a
   simple realization based on homogeneous and local metasurfaces to
   achieve negative refraction and imaging, and we then extend our results
   to arbitrary PT-symmetric two-port networks to realize aberration-free
   planar imaging.}},

Volume = {{112}},

Abstract = {{We report experimental three-phase oil relative permeability in two
   water-wet media (a sandpack and a Berea sandstone core) along different
   saturation paths. Three oils with different viscosities, compositions,
   and spreading coefficients were used in the measurements. The data show
   that oil relative permeability can vary significantly along different
   saturation paths. Most importantly, we find that despite the significant
   (orders of magnitude) variation of oil relative permeability along
   different saturation paths, the oil relative permeability in each medium
   can be collapsed into a single relative permeability curve, once they
   are plotted as a function of mobile oil saturation. However, this
   collapsed curve varies depending on the porous media. We show that the
   same behavior occurs in the relative permeability data published over
   the past 50 years. These observations indicate that the key factor in
   differences between oil permeabilities in the same porous media is
   changes in the residual oil saturation. We examine the performance of
   most commonly used relative permeability models, i.e., Corey,
   Saturation-Weighted Interpolation (SWI), and Stone against our data.
   Given the importance of residual oil saturation, we fit the experimental
   data along different saturation paths by treating the residual oil
   saturation in these models as the fitting parameter while keeping the
   other parameters constant. We find that the Corey and SWI models fit the
   data very well while the Stone model performs poorly at low saturations.
   We find that residual oil saturation is a nonlinear function of
   gas/water saturation as opposed to linear relationship previously
   suggested by others.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconducting nanowires (NWs) are becoming essential nanobuilding
   blocks for advanced devices from sensors to energy harvesters, however
   their full technology penetration requires large scale materials
   synthesis together with efficient NW assembly methods. We demonstrate a
   scalable one-step solution process for the direct selection, collection,
   and ordered assembly of silicon NWs with desired electrical properties
   from a poly disperse collection of NWs obtained from a supercritical
   fluid liquid solid growth process. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) combined with
   impedance spectroscopy provides a selection mechanism at high signal
   frequencies (>500 kHz) to isolate NWs with the highest conductivity and
   lowest defect density. The technique allows simultaneous control of five
   key parameters in NW assembly: selection of electrical properties,
   control of NW length, placement in predefined electrode areas, highly
   preferential orientation along the device channel, and control of NWs
   deposition density from few to hundreds per device. Direct correlation
   between DEP signal frequency and deposited NWs conductivity is confirmed
   by field-effect transistor and conducting AFM data. Fabricated NW

Abstract = {{This study reports a Pickering emulsion flooding system, in which the
   oil-water interface is structurally stabilized by a complex colloidal
   layer consisting of silica nanoparticles, dodecyltrimethylammonium
   bromide (DTAB), and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium
   salt (PSS-co-MA). The colloidal layer was generated by adsorption of
   PSS-co-MA on the silica nanoparticles as a result of the van der Waals
   attraction and by adsorption of DTAB onto the PSS-co-MA layer as a
   result of the electrostatic attraction, thus providing the mechanically
   robust, stable interface. To demonstrate a practical applicability to
   the enhanced oil recovery, the complex colloidal dispersion fluid was
   injected into the Berea sandstone for a core flooding experiment. The
   result revealed that the colloidal dispersion significantly increased
   the oil recovery by similar to 4\% compared to the case of flooding
   water. This means that the emulsion drops in situ produced in the core
   could readily flow through the rock pores. We attribute this to the fact
   that the oil-water interface made with the complex colloidal phase not
   only increased the structural stability of the emulsion drops but also
   provided them deformability without any drop breakup or coalescence.}},

Abstract = {{Communication at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies is defining a new
   era of wireless communication. The mmWave band offers higher bandwidth
   communication channels versus those presently used in commercial
   wireless systems. The applications of mmWave are immense: wireless local
   and personal area networks in the unlicensed band, 5G cellular systems,
   not to mention vehicular area networks, ad hoc networks, and wearables.
   Signal processing is critical for enabling the next generation of mmWave
   communication. Due to the use of large antenna arrays at the transmitter
   and receiver, combined with radio frequency and mixed signal power
   constraints, new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication
   signal processing techniques are needed. Because of the wide bandwidths,
   low complexity transceiver algorithms become important. There are
   opportunities to exploit techniques like compressed sensing for channel
   estimation and beamforming. This article provides an overview of signal
   processing challenges in mmWave wireless systems, with an emphasis on
   those faced by using MIMO communication at higher carrier frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of full-duplex
   multiuser relay networks employing opportunistic scheduling with noisy
   and compressive feedback. Specifically, two feedback techniques based on
   compressive sensing (CS) theory are introduced and their effect on the
   system performance is analyzed. The problem of joint user identity and
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation at the base-station is casted as
   a block sparse signal recovery problem in CS. Using existing CS block
   recovery algorithms, the identity of the strong users is obtained and
   their corresponding SNRs are estimated using the best linear unbiased
   estimator (BLUE). To minimize the effect of feedback noise on the
   estimated SNRs, a backoff strategy that optimally backsoff on the noisy
   estimated SNRs is introduced, and the error covariance matrix of the
   noise after CS recovery is derived. Finally, closed-form expressions for
   the end-to-end SNRs of the system are derived. Numerical results show
   that the proposed techniques drastically reduce the feedback air-time
   and achieve a rate close to that obtained by scheduling techniques that
   require dedicated error-free feedback from all network users. Key
   findings of this paper suggest that the choice of half-duplex or
   full-duplex SNR feedback is dependent on the channel coherence interval,
   and on low coherence intervals, full-duplex feedback is superior to the
   interference-free half-duplex feedback.}},

Abstract = {{A simple, inexpensive flow-focusing device has been developed to make
   uniform droplets for biochemical reactions, such as in vitro
   transcription and cell-free protein synthesis. The device was fabricated
   from commercially available components without special equipment. Using
   the emulsion droplets formed by the device, a class I ligase ribozyme,
   bcI 23, was successfully synthesized from DNA attached to magnetic
   microbeads by 17 RNA polymerase. It was also ligated with an RNA
   substrate on the same microbeads, and detected using flow cytometry with
   a fluorescent probe. In addition, a single-chain derivative of the
   lambda Cro protein was expressed using an Escherichia coli cell-free
   protein synthesis system in emulsion, which was prepared using the
   flow-focusing device. In both emulsified reactions, usage of the flow
   focusing device was able to greatly reduce the coefficient of variation
   for the amount of RNA or protein displayed on the microbeads,
   demonstrating the device is advantageous for quantitative analysis in
   high-throughput screening. (C) 2015, The Society for Biotechnology,

Abstract = {{Astaxanthin, a kind of photosynthetic pigment, was employed for gold
   nanoparticle formation. Nanoparticles were characterized using
   Ulteraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, transmission electron

   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The cytotoxic effect of synthesized
   nanoparticles was evaluated against MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer
   cells) using a tetrazolium-based assay, and synthesized nanoparticles
   exhibited dose-dependent toxicity. The morphology upon cell death was
   differentiated through fluorescent microscopy using different stains
   that predicted apoptosis. The synthesized nanoparticles were applied in
   ultrasound-coupled photoacoustic imaging to obtain good images of
   treated cells. Astaxanthin-reduced gold nanoparticle has the potential
   to act as a promising agent in the field of photo-based diagnosis and

Abstract = {{Management of Tamponade Following AF Ablation With FXaI. Introduction:
   Because of the absence of a dedicated reversal agent, the outcome of
   pericardial effusion (PE) following procedures performed with
   uninterrupted apixaban or rivaroxaban is unknown. We report the
   characteristics of PEs presenting with tamponade in patients undergoing
   AF ablation with uninterrupted factor Xa inhibition (FXaI) to understand
   their management and prognosis.
   Methods and Results: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional survey
   in 10 centers across the United States. Patient data were obtained by
   chart review. In all patients the procedure was performed with
   uninterrupted FXaI. A total of 16 PEs requiring intervention were
   reported from 5 centers. Two patients were on apixaban 5 mg BD, the
   remaining on rivaroxaban 20 mg OD. Eleven PEs occurred in the
   periprocedural setting, and 5 PEs occurred from 1 to 28 days after the
   procedure. Pericardiocentesis and drainage were performed in all cases.
   Protamine and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) were
   given in all periprocedural cases. Two patients required surgery: in one
   case coagulation of the pericardial blood prevented effective drainage,
   and in the other bleeding was secondary to a steam pop-induced atrial
   tear. None of the postprocedural cases required FXaI reversal and the
   dose of rivaroxaban was temporarily reduced. No fatal outcomes or
   thromboembolic events were reported.
   Conclusion: Pericardiocentesis and drainage with FXaI reversal proved
   effective in the management of acute PEs with tamponade occurring
   periprocedurally in patients undergoing AF ablation with uninterrupted
   FXaI. Early postprocedural effusions can be treated with
   pericardiocentesis without the need of a reversal agent.}},

Abstract = {{Amateur baseball contests, particularly those involving young players,
   often feature a run limit, which establishes a maximum number of runs
   that may be scored in a half-inning of play. Although conventional
   wisdom can be used for designing the batting order under standard
   baseball rules, the composition of the optimal lineup under run limit is
   still unclear, and the best batting order could differ significantly
   from the traditional ordering. In this paper, we consider the impact of
   run limits on the design of the optimal batting order, by developing a
   Markov chain model for calculating the expected number of runs scored
   (ENRS) under 3- and 5-run limits. We apply this model to both a
   high-quality and a lower-quality team, using the data from the 2011
   Little League World Series, and illustrate the effect of run limit on
   the ENRS and the optimal batting order.}},

   Network Classifier}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A set-based approach is presented for exploring multilevel design
   problems. The approach is applied to design negative stiffness
   metamaterials with mechanical stiffness and loss properties that surpass
   those of conventional composites. Negative stiffness metamaterials
   derive their properties from their internal structure, specifically by
   embedding small volume fractions of negative stiffness inclusions in a
   continuous host material. Achieving high stiffness and loss from these
   materials by design involves managing complex interdependencies among
   design variables across a range of length scales. Hierarchical material
   models are created for length scales ranging from the structure of the
   microscale negative stiffness inclusions to the effective properties of
   mesoscale metamaterials to the performance of an illustrative macroscale
   component. Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) are used to map promising
   regions of the design space at each hierarchical modeling level, and the
   maps are intersected to identify sets of multilevel solutions that are
   likely to provide desirable system performance. The approach is
   particularly appropriate for highly efficient, top-down,
   performance-driven, multilevel design, as opposed to bottom-up,
   trial-and-error multilevel modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Black phosphorus (BP) has attracted rapidly growing attention for high
   speed and low power nanoelectronics owing to its compelling combination
   of tunable bandgap (0.3 to 2 eV) and high carrier mobility (up to
   similar to 1000 cm(2)/V-s) at room temperature. In this work, we report
   the first radio frequency (RF) flexible top-gated (TG) BP thin-film
   transistors on highly bendable polyimide substrate for GHz
   nanoelectronic applications. Enhanced p-type charge transport with
   low-field mobility similar to 233 cm(2)/V.s and current density of
   similar to 400 mu A/mu m at V-DS = -2 V were obtained from flexible BP
   transistor at a channel length L = 0.5 mu m. Importantly, with optimized
   dielectric coating for air-stability during microfabrication, flexible
   BP RF transistors afforded intrinsic maximum oscillation frequency
   f(MAX) similar to 14.5 GHz and unity current gain cutoff frequency f(T),
   similar to 17.5 GHz at a channel length of 0.5 mu m. Notably, the
   experimental f(T) achieved here is at least 45\% higher than prior
   results on rigid substrate, which is attributed to the improved
   air-stability of fabricated BP devices. In addition, the high-frequency
   performance was investigated through mechanical bending test up to
   similar to 1.5\% tensile strain, which is ultimately limited by the
   inorganic dielectric film rather than the 2D material. Comparison of BP
   RF devices to other 2D semiconductors clearly indicates that BP offers
   the highest saturation velocity, an important metric for high-speed and
   RF flexible nanosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a method for super resolution ultrasound imaging,

   stationary, temporally transient microbubbles provide high ultrasound
   contrast for several to hundreds of milliseconds before recondensing to
   their native liquid nanodroplet state. By capturing high frame rate
   ultrasound images of blinking LANDs, we demonstrate the ability to
   detect individual recondensation events. Then we apply a newly developed
   super-resolution image processing algorithm to localize the LAND
   positions in vivo almost an order of magnitude better than conventional
   ultrasound imaging. These results pave the way for high resolution
   molecular imaging deep in tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrathin plasmonic metasurfaces have proven their ability to control
   and manipulate light at unprecedented levels, leading to exciting
   optical functionalities and applications. Although to date metasurfaces
   have mainly been investigated from an electromagnetic perspective, their
   ultrathin nature may also provide novel and useful mechanical
   properties. Here we propose a thin piezoelectric plasmonic metasurface
   forming the resonant body of a nanomechanical resonator with
   simultaneously tailored optical and electromechanical properties. We
   experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to achieve high
   thermomechanical coupling between electromagnetic and mechanical
   resonances in a single ultrathin piezoelectric nanoplate. The
   combination of nanoplasmonic and piezoelectric resonances allows the
   proposed device to selectively detect long-wavelength infrared radiation
   with unprecedented electromechanical performance and thermal
   capabilities. These attributes lead to the demonstration of a fast,
   high-resolution, uncooled infrared detector with similar to 80\%

Abstract = {{The enhancement of Pt nanoparticle anchoring strength and dispersion on
   carbon supports is highly desirable in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cells (PEMFCs) as well as in other catalysis processes. Presented here
   is a comprehensive study of the interaction between catalyst
   nanoparticles and carbon supports in terms of the electronic structure
   change and its effects on the electrocatalytic performance of supported
   catalysts. Graphene was chosen as an ideal model support because the
   unique 2-D structure allows the direct investigation of the interaction
   with supported metal nanoparticles at their interface. We developed a
   facile strategy to covalently graft p-phenyl SO3H or p-phenyl NH2-groups
   onto the graphene surface. The functional groups were found to not only
   facilitate the homogeneous distribution of Pt nanoparticles on the
   surface of graphene supports and reduce the Pt average particle size but
   also strengthen the interaction of the Pt atoms with the functional
   groups and, consequently, minimize the migration/coalescence of the Pt
   nanoparticles in the course of accelerated durability tests. The
   experimental results from both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate the electron density

Abstract = {{Modern variable speed wind turbines operate within a large range of wind
   speeds. Control of such a turbine is partitioned in two modes: a low
   wind speed mode and a high wind speed mode. Depending on the prevailing
   wind speed, a turbine is controlled to switch between these two modes.
   During mode switching, critical dynamics of the turbine such as the
   output power and mechanical loads can experience steep, large changes
   even though the switching action is Lyapunov as well as input-output
   stable. In this work, a new control technique is presented to attenuate
   the steep and large volatile dynamics during turbine switching while
   preserving the original system structure so that the established system
   stability still holds. An algorithm that modifies the generator torque
   control law in the low wind speed mode is developed to reduce the steep
   change of turbine power and torque. A Proportional-integral (PI) control
   of blade pitch angle in the high wind speed mode is proposed to optimize
   the system power variation and power generation. Simulations conducted
   under various wind speed classes demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed control design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a power-based network-constrained unit commitment
   (UC) model as an alternative to the traditional deterministic UCs to
   deal with wind generation uncertainty. The formulation draws a clear
   distinction between power-capacity and ramp-capability reserves to deal
   with wind production uncertainty. These power and ramp requirements can
   be obtained from wind forecast information. The model is formulated as a
   power-based UC, which schedules power-trajectories instead of the
   traditional energy-blocks and takes into account the inherent startup
   and shutdown power trajectories of thermal units. These characteristics
   allow a correct representation of unit's ramp schedule which define
   their ramp availability for reserves. The proposed formulation
   significantly decreases operation costs compared to traditional
   deterministic and stochastic UC formulations while simultaneously
   lowering the computational burden. The operation cost comparison is made
   through 5-min economic dispatch simulation under hundreds of
   out-of-sample wind generation scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The spin-helical Dirac fermion topological surface states in a
   topological insulator nanowire or nanoribbon promise novel topological
   devices and exotic physics such as Majorana fermions. Here, we report
   local and non-local transport measurements in Bi2Te3 topological
   insulator nanoribbons that exhibit quasi-ballistic transport over
   similar to 2 mu m. The conductance versus axial magnetic flux F exhibits
   Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with maxima occurring alternately at
   half-integer or integer flux quanta (Phi(0) = h/e, where h is Planck's
   constant and e is the electron charge) depending periodically on the
   gate-tuned Fermi wavevector (k(F)) with period 2 pi/C (where C is the
   nanoribbon circumference). The conductance versus gate voltage also
   exhibits k(F)-periodic oscillations, anti-correlated between Phi = 0 and
   Phi(0)/2. These oscillations enable us to probe the Bi2Te3 band
   structure, and are consistent with the circumferentially quantized
   topological surface states forming a series of one-dimensional subbands,
   which undergo periodic magnetic field-induced topological transitions
   with the disappearance/appearance of the gapless Dirac point with a

Journal = {{NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{182}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{502-522}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new methodology for explicitly incorporating
   uncertainties in key parameters into decision making regarding the
   transition between various nuclear fuel cycles. These key
   uncertainties-in demand growth rates, technology availability, and
   technology costs, among others-are unlikely to be resolved for several
   decades and invalidate the concept of planning for a unique optimal
   transition strategy. Past time-dependent analyses of the nuclear fuel
   cycle have confronted uncertainties by using a scenario-based approach
   where key variables are parametrically varied, which gives rise to
   inflexible courses of action associated with optima for each scenario.
   Instead, this work selects hedging strategies through a decision making
   under uncertainty framework. These strategies are found by applying a
   choice criterion to select courses of action that mitigate regrets.
   These regrets are calculated by evaluating the performance of all
   possible transition strategies for every feasible outcome of the
   uncertain parameter(s). The methodology is applied to a case study
   involving transition from the current once-through light water reactor
   fuel cycle to one relying on continuous recycle in fast reactors, and
   the effect of choice criterion is explored. Hedging strategies are found
   that preserve significant flexibility to allow alteration of the fuel
   cycle strategy once these uncertainties are resolved. This work may
   provide guidance for agent-based, behavioral modeling in fuel cycle
   simulators as well as decision making in real-world applications.}},

Abstract = {{La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM), a promising electrolyte material
   for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, can be sintered to
   a fully dense state by a flash-sintering technique. In this work, LSGM
   is sintered by the current-limiting flash-sintering process at 690
   degrees C under an electric field of 100 V cm (1), in comparison with up
   to 1400 degrees C or even higher temperature in conventional furnace
   sintering. The resultant LSGM samples are investigated by scanning
   electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy. The SEM images exhibit well-densified microstructures
   while XRD results show that the perovskite structure after
   flash-sintering does not changed. EIS results show that the conductivity
   of LSGM sintered by the current-limiting flash-sintering process
   increases with sintering current density value. The conductivity of
   samples sintered at 120 mA mm(-2) reaches 0.049 s cm(-1) at 800 degrees
   C, which is approximate to the value of conventional sintered LSGM
   samples at 1400 degrees C. Additionally, the flash-sintering process is
   interpreted by Joule heating theory. Therefore, the current-limiting
   flash-sintering technique is proved to be an energy-efficient and
   eligible approach for the densification of LSGM and other materials
   requiring high sintering temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{coupling the tools of synthetic biology with traditional molecular
   genetic techniques can enable the rapid prototyping and optimization of
   yeast strains. While the era of yeast synthetic biology began in the
   well-characterized model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is
   swiftly expanding to include non conventional yeast production systems
   such as Hansenula polymorpha, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia pas torts,
   and Yarrowia lipolytica. These yeasts already have roles in the
   manufacture of vaccines, therapeutic proteins, food additives, and
   biorenewable chemicals, but recent synthetic biology advances have the
   potential to greatly expand and diversify their impact on biotechnology.
   In this review, we summarize the development of synthetic biological
   tools (including promoters and terminators) and enabling molecular
   genetics approaches that have been applied in these four promising
   alternative biomanufacturing Platforms. An emphasis is placed on
   synthetic parts and genome editing tools. Finally, we discuss examples
   of synthetic tools developed in other organisms that can be adapted or
   optimized for these hosts in the near future. (C)2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We have achieved 140-nm channel length graphene thin-film transistors
   (TFTs) on flexible glass with a 95-GHz intrinsic cutoff frequency and
   greater than 30-GHz intrinsic power frequency after standard
   de-embedding. The flexible glass substrate offers subnanometer surface
   smoothness as well as high thermal conductivity, 1 W/m . K, which can
   prevent thermomechanical failure, which is a limitation of plastic and
   rubber substrates. In addition, we developed a flexible 60-nm polyimide
   thin film as gate dielectric with low surface roughness less than 0.35
   nm for optimal carrier transport and facilitate edge-injection contacts
   for low contact resistance. The maximum electron (hole) mobility is 4540
   (1100) cm(2)/V . s, and the extracted contact resistance in the electron
   (hole) branch is 1140 (720) Omega . mu m. The intrinsic cutoff frequency
   is 196\% higher than our previous results on polymeric substrates.
   Importantly, the experimental saturation velocity of the graphene TFT is
   the highest for any flexible transistor on any material system reported
   so far.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a large database of n data items that need to be stored using m
   servers. We study how to encode information so that a large number k of
   read requests can be performed in parallel, while the rate remains
   constant (and ideally approaches one). This problem is equivalent to the
   design of multiset batch codes introduced by Ishai et al. We give the
   families of multiset batch codes with asymptotically optimal rates of
   the form 1-1/poly(k) and a number of servers m scaling polynomially in
   the number of read requests k. An advantage of our batch code
   constructions over most previously known multiset batch codes is
   explicit and deterministic decoding algorithms and asymptotically
   optimal fault tolerance. Our main technical innovation is a
   graphtheoretic method of designing multiset batch codes using dense
   bipartite graphs with no small cycles. We modify prior graph
   constructions of dense, high-girth graphs to obtain our batch code
   results. We achieve close-to-optimal tradeoffs between the parameters
   for bipartite graph-based batch codes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate an energy-reduction strategy that
   overcomes the stochastic switching characteristics of the
   spin-torque-transfer magnetic-RAM (STT-RAM) write operation and propose
   a write completion circuit needed for it. In contrast to the traditional
   worst case approach, which fixes the write duration for all cells, the
   proposed write technique terminates the write pulse after a write
   process finishes by monitoring the state of a cell. Since the average
   write duration is far shorter than the worst case duration, the average
   write energy is significantly reduced by the proposed architecture. We
   developed a write completion circuit for state change detection and
   bitline termination, and evaluated it using a compact STT-RAM model
   targeting an implementation in a 16-nm technology node. We also
   developed a variation-tolerant version of the design specifically suited
   for handling significant variation in process parameters for both FETs
   and magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), and the low value of tunnel
   magnetoresistance of practical MTJs. Analysis indicates that at the
   required write-error rate, the proposed architecture reduces write
   energy by 36\%-97\% compared with the conventional designs relying on
   the worst case approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers important insights on the development of the
   microstructure in asphalt binders as a function of the treatment
   temperature. Different treatment temperatures are useful to understand
   how dispersed domains form when different driving energies for the
   mobility of molecular species are provided. Small and flat dispersed
   domains, with average diameter between 0.02 and 0.70 m, were detected on
   the surface of two binders at room temperature, and these domains were
   observed to grow with an increase in treatment temperature (up to over 2
   m). Bee-like structures started to appear after treatment at or above
   100 degrees C. Moreover, the effect of the binder thickness on its
   microstructure at room temperature and at higher treatment temperatures
   was investigated and is discussed in this paper. At room temperature,
   the average size of the dispersed domains increased as the binder
   thickness decreased. A hypothesis that conciliates current theories on
   the origin and development of dispersed domains is proposed. Small
   dispersed domains (average diameter around 0.02 m) are present in the
   bulk of the binder, whereas larger domains and bee-like structures
   develop on the surface, following heat treatment or mechanical
   disturbance that reduces the film thickness. Molecular mobility and
   association are the key factors in the development of binder
   microstructure.}},

Title = {{Reducing synuclein accumulation improves neuronal survival after spinal

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},

Volume = {{278}},
Pages = {{105-115}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Spinal cord injury causes neuronal death, limiting subsequent
   regeneration and recovery. Thus, there is a need to develop strategies
   for improving neuronal survival after injury. Relative to our
   understanding of axon regeneration, comparatively little is known about
   the mechanisms that promote the survival of damaged neurons. To address
   this, we took advantage of lamprey giant reticulospinal neurons whose
   large size permits detailed examination of post-injury molecular
   responses at the level of individual, identified cells. We report here
   that spinal cord injury caused a select subset of giant reticulospinal
   neurons to accumulate synuclein, a synaptic veside-associated protein
   best known for its atypical aggregation and causal role in
   neurodegeneration in Parkinson's and other diseases. Post-injury
   synuclein accumulation took the form of punctate aggregates throughout
   the somata and occurred selectively in dying neurons, but not in those
   that survived. In contrast, another synaptic vesicle protein,
   synaptotagmin, did not accumulate in response to injury. We further show
   that the post-injury synuclein accumulation was greatly attenuated after
   single dose application of either the ``molecular tweezer{''} inhibitor,
   CLR01, or a translation-blocking synuclein morpholino. Consequently,
   reduction of synuclein accumulation not only improved neuronal survival,
   but also increased the number of axons in the spinal cord proximal and
   distal to the lesion. This study is the first to reveal that reducing
   synuclein accumulation is a novel strategy for improving neuronal
   survival after spinal cord injury. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM)-guided ablation
   targets sites that are thought to sustain atrial fibrillation (AF).
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute and
   mid-term outcomes of FIRM -guided only ablation in patients with
   nonparoxysmal AF.
   METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients with persistent and
   long-standing persistent (LSP) AF at three centers to undergo FIRM
   guided only ablation. We evaluated acute procedural success (defined as
   AF termination, organization, or >= 10\% slowing), safety (incidence of
   periprocedural complications), and long-term success (single-procedure
   freedom from atrial tachycardia {[}AT]/AF off antiarrhythmic drugs
   {[}AAD] after a 2-month blanking period).
   RESULTS Twenty-nine patients with persistent (N = 20) and LSP (N = 9) AF
   underwent FIRM mapping. Rotors were presents in all patients, with a
   mean of 4 +/- 1.2 per patient (62\% were left atrial); 1 focal impulse
   was identified. All sources were successfully ablated, and overall acute
   success rate was 41\% (0 AF termination, 2 AF slowing, 10 AF
   organization). There were no major procedure related adverse events.
   After a mean 5.7 months of follow-up, single-procedure freedom from
   AT/AF without AADs was 17\%.
   CONCLUSION In nonparoxysmal AF patients, targeted ablation of
   FIRM-identified rotors is not effective in obtaining AF termination,
   organization, or slowing during the procedure. After mid-term follow-up,
   the strategy of ablating FIRM-identified rotors alone did not prevent
   recurrence from AT/AF.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its high modularity and carry-free addition, a redundant binary
   (RB) representation can be used when designing high performance
   multipliers. The conventional RB multiplier requires an additional RB
   partial product (RBPP) row, because an error-correcting word (ECW) is
   generated by both the radix-4 Modified Booth encoding (MBE) and the RB
   encoding. This incurs in an additional RBPP accumulation stage for the
   MBE multiplier. In this paper, a new RB modified partial product
   generator (RBMPPG) is proposed; it removes the extra ECW and hence, it
   saves one RBPP accumulation stage. Therefore, the proposed RBMPPG
   generates fewer partial product rows than a conventional RB MBE
   multiplier. Simulation results show that the proposed RBMPPG based
   designs significantly improve the area and power consumption when the
   word length of each operand in the multiplier is at least 32 bits; these
   reductions over previous NB multiplier designs incur in a modest delay
   increase (approximately 5 percent). The power-delay product can be
   reduced by up to 59 percent using the proposed RB multipliers when
   compared with existing RB multipliers.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation has been identified as
   a novel method to improve durability and remediate cracks in concrete.
   One way to introduce microorganisms to concrete is by replacing the
   mixing water with a bacterial culture in nutrient medium. In the
   literature, yeast extract often has been used as a carbon source for
   this application; however, severe retardation of hydration kinetics has
   been observed when yeast extract is added to cement. This study
   investigates the suitability of alternative carbon sources to replace
   yeast extract for microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation in
   cement-based materials. A combination of meat extract and sodium acetate
   was identified as a suitable replacement in growth medium for
   Sporosarcina pasteurii; this alternative growth medium reduced
   retardation by 75 \% (as compared to yeast extract) without compromising
   bacterial growth, urea hydrolysis, cell zeta potential, and ability to
   promote calcium carbonate formation.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Glioblastoma is an aggressive and highly infiltrative brain
   cancer. Standard surgical resection is guided by enhancement on
   postcontrast T1-weighted (T1) magnetic resonance imaging, which is
   insufficient for delineating surrounding infiltrating tumor.OBJECTIVE:To
   develop imaging biomarkers that delineate areas of tumor infiltration
   and predict early recurrence in peritumoral tissue. Such markers would
   enable intensive, yet targeted, surgery and radiotherapy, thereby
   potentially delaying recurrence and prolonging
   survival.METHODS:Preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance images
   (T1, T1-gadolinium, T2-weighted, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion
   recovery, diffusion tensor imaging, and dynamic susceptibility
   contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images) from 31 patients were
   combined using machine learning methods, thereby creating predictive
   spatial maps of infiltrated peritumoral tissue. Cross-validation was
   used in the retrospective cohort to achieve generalizable biomarkers.
   Subsequently, the imaging signatures learned from the retrospective
   study were used in a replication cohort of 34 new patients. Spatial maps
   representing the likelihood of tumor infiltration and future early
   recurrence were compared with regions of recurrence on postresection
   follow-up studies with pathology confirmation.RESULTS:This technique
   produced predictions of early recurrence with a mean area under the
   curve of 0.84, sensitivity of 91\%, specificity of 93\%, and odds ratio
   estimates of 9.29 (99\% confidence interval: 8.95-9.65) for tissue
   predicted to be heavily infiltrated in the replication study. Regions of
   tumor recurrence were found to have subtle, yet fairly distinctive
   multiparametric imaging signatures when analyzed quantitatively by
   pattern analysis and machine learning.CONCLUSION:Visually imperceptible
   imaging patterns discovered via multiparametric pattern analysis methods
   were found to estimate the extent of infiltration and location of future
   tumor recurrence, paving the way for improved targeted
   treatment.ABBREVIATIONS:AUC, area under the curveBBB, blood-brain

Abstract = {{As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and
   environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in
   importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather
   than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each
   of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality,
   efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The CYCLUS nuclear
   fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate
   modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to
   solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis
   can be better addressed. A summary of the CYCLUS fuel cycle simulator
   framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the
   implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating
   challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current
   capabilities of CYCLUS are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel
   cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{While it has become axiomatic that mechanical signals promote in vitro
   engineered tissue formation, the underlying mechanisms remain largely
   unknown. Moreover, efforts to date to determine parameters for optimal
   extracellular matrix (ECM) development have been largely empirical. In
   the present work, we propose a two-pronged approach involving novel
   theoretical developments coupled with key experimental data to develop
   better mechanistic understanding of growth and development of dense
   connective tissue under mechanical stimuli. To describe cellular
   proliferation and ECM synthesis that occur at rates of days to weeks, we
   employ mixture theory to model the construct constituents as a
   nutrient-cell-ECM triphasic system, their transport, and their
   biochemical reactions. Dynamic conditioning protocols with frequencies
   around 1 Hz are described with multi-scale methods to couple the
   dissimilar time scales. Enhancement of nutrient transport due to pore
   fluid advection is upscaled into the growth model, and the spatially
   dependent ECM distribution describes the evolving poroelastic
   characteristics of the scaffold-engineered tissue construct. Simulation
   results compared favorably to the existing experimental data, and most
   importantly, distinguish between static and dynamic conditioning
   regimes. The theoretical framework for mechanically conditioned tissue
   engineering (TE) permits not only the formulation of novel and
   better-informed mechanistic hypothesis describing the phenomena
   underlying TE growth and development, but also the
   exploration/optimization of conditioning protocols in a rational manner.}},

Abstract = {{Despite various research efforts focusing on the development of an
   effective measurement system, most project performance metrics were
   designed for post evaluation of processes and practices after project
   completion. This paper presents performance metrics tailored to
   phase-based benchmarking, which can be utilized as both leading and
   lagging indicators. Built upon industry experts' input and an extensive
   review of existing metrics, a framework for performance metrics was
   developed to evaluate performance outcomes for five major phases; front
   end planning/programming, design/engineering, procurement, construction,
   and startup/commissioning. Within this framework, phase-wise and
   phase-specific metrics were created under the categories of cost,
   schedule, efficiency, staffing, procurement, and safety performance. The
   results show that the framework and metrics are effective for the
   evaluation of project performance throughout capital project delivery.
   By employing the benchmarking process during the course of the project,
   industry practitioners can improve project performance and develop
   proactive strategies for subsequent phases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM

Title = {{Conformability of a Thin Elastic Membrane Laminated on a Soft Substrate
   With Slightly Wavy Surface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{When laminating a thin elastic membrane on a substrate with surface
   roughness, three scenarios can happen: fully conformed (FC), i.e., the
   membrane completely follows the surface morphology of the substrate
   without any interfacial gap, nonconformed (NC), i.e., the membrane
   remains flat if gravity is not concerned, and partially conformed (PC).
   Good conformability can enhance effective membrane-to-substrate adhesion
   strength and can facilitate signal/heat/mass transfer across the
   interface, which are of great importance to soft electronics laminated
   on rough bio-tissues. To reveal governing parameters in this problem and
   to predict conformability, energy minimization is implemented after
   successfully finding the substrate elastic energy under partially
   conformable contact. Four dimensionless governing parameters involving
   the substrate roughness, membrane thickness, membrane and substrate
   elastic moduli, and membrane-to-substrate intrinsic work of adhesion
   have been identified to analytically predict the conformability status
   and the area of contact. The analytical prediction has found excellent
   agreement with experimental observations. In summary, an experimentally
   validated quantitative guideline for the conformability of elastic
   membrane on soft corrugated substrate has been established in the

Title = {{Factors influencing soil surface seismic hazard curves}},
Journal = {{SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{180-190}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Performance-based seismic design of important structures requires design
   ground motions from probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) that
   incorporate the effects of local site conditions. Seismic hazard curves
   incorporating site-specific soil conditions can be generated through the
   convolution of rock hazard curves with statistical models for
   site-specific ground motion amplification factors (AF). The AF
   relationships are developed from a series of site response analyses. The
   goal of this study is to evaluate how the AF relationships and the
   resulting surface hazard curves are influenced by different approaches
   in the site response analysis, specifically the time series (TS) vs.
   random vibration theory (RVT) approaches, and by different levels of
   shear wave velocity variability introduced in the site response
   analysis. The results show that the median AF relationships derived from
   TS and RVT analyses are similar, except at periods near the site period,
   where RVT analysis may predict larger AF. Including the effect of shear
   wave velocity variability reduces the median AF and increases the
   standard deviation associated with the AF relationship (sigma(lnAF)).
   Generally, the soil hazard curve derived by the AF relationship with the
   largest sigma(lnAF) generates the largest ground motions, and this
   effect is most significant at small annual frequencies of exceedance.
   The effect of sigma(lnAF) on soil hazard curves is larger than the
   effect of different median AF relationships. The value of sigma(lnAF) is
   influenced significantly by the variability in the shear wave velocity
   and therefore proper specification of this variability is critical when
   developing soil hazard curves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of system configurations, distributed expertise
   requirements and various constraints, coordination of mechanical,
   electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems is considered by many construction
   professionals one of the most challenging tasks in the delivery process
   of construction projects. MEP coordination is an iterative and
   experience-driven process, which entails considerable time and human
   resources. While this process is repeated in every project, there is
   seldom a systematic way to capture and store the information produced in
   the process to formalize lessons learned and to support future decision
   making. This paper presents a formalized schema that can be used to
   capture clash features and associated solutions during MEP coordination.
   This representation schema provides a formalized structure for clash
   documentation to support management of coordination and, more
   importantly, to capture experiential knowledge to support future
   decision making. The presented schema integrates findings from previous
   research, observations from two field studies and a laboratory
   experiment. The results were validated using project data. (C) 2016

Journal = {{GEOTEXTILES AND GEOMEMBRANES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{188-200}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a centrifuge study performed to
   investigate the time-dependent behavior of geotextile-reinforced soil
   walls. To this effect, reduced-scale centrifuge models were built using
   nonwoven fabrics as reinforcement elements and Monterey no. 30 sand as
   backfill. Digital image analysis techniques were used to quantify the
   internal displacements within the reinforced zone, where sand markers
   had been placed along the reinforcement layers. A sigmoid function was
   found to provide adequate fit to raw displacement data, allowing
   estimation of the strain distribution along the reinforcement layers.
   This investigation includes an initial series of centrifuge models
   designated as ``Short-term{''} tests, which were loaded to failure by
   continuously increasing the acceleration imparted to them. In addition,
   a series of models designated as ``Long-term{''} tests were conducted by
   subjecting them to constant accelerations corresponding to 25\%, 40\%,
   60\% and 80\% of the g-level at failure obtained from the
   ``Short-term{''} tests. The results revealed that walls subjected to
   constant acceleration showed a time dependent behavior that adversely
   affected their stability. Considerable time-dependent deformations were
   observed to occur during the ``Long-term{''} tests. That is,
   time-dependent deformations in the reinforcements, quantified using
   geosynthetic samples tested in isolation, were found to also develop
   under confinement in the centrifuge models. In particular, creep failure
   was observed in the ``Long-term{''} models subjected to comparatively
   high levels of constant acceleration. The time-dependent deformations
   from confined geotextiles tested in the centrifuge testing program were
   compared against the results from unconfined geotextiles tested in a
   conventional creep testing program. The time to failure defined using
   data from centrifuge tests was found to be consistent with that obtained
   from conventional creep tests. The soil used in the centrifuge models in
   this study, frequently considered as having negligible creep, was
   ultimately found not to prevent the development of time-dependent
   deformations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years decreasing hardware costs have driven down the installed
   price of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and spurred adoption. However,
   system cost is not the only barrier faced by solar adopters. Potential
   adopters also face various informational barriers, leading to high
   indirect costs during the information search process. There is a
   significant gap in the literature for empirical work on solar adoption
   linking how the information context (installer marketing; neighbors with
   solar, i.e., peer effects; etc.) interacts with a potential adopter's
   motivations to impact decision outcomes. To address this gap we present
   results of a new survey on the decision-making process of residential PV
   adopters in northern California. The main aspects of our analysis
   include: salient motivating factors, information gathering process, peer
   effects, role of installers, and factors driving the choice of outright
   purchase versus third-party ownership (e.g., leasing) modes of adoption.
   We find that installers and neighbors play important, but often
   supplementary, roles throughout the decision-making process and have
   influence on both the decision to adopt as well as on the mode of
   adoption. Furthermore, expected financial returns and concerns about
   operations and maintenance are the main determining factors for the mode
   of adoption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{263}},

Abstract = {{Based on density functional theory calculations, we present that pairs
   of 1st nearest Pd monomers play an important role in significantly
   enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the AuPd(100) surface.
   While the catalytic ORR activity tends to be sensitive to the surface
   atomic ordering, we find that the Pd monomer pairs lead to a substantial
   reduction in the activation barrier for O/OH hydrogenation with no
   significant suppression of O-O bond scission, thereby considerably
   lowering the overall activation energy for the ORR as compared to the
   case of pure Pd(100). On the other hand, an isolated Pd monomer tends to
   greatly suppress the O-O bond cleavage reaction, which in turn slows
   down the ORR kinetics. Unlike the monodentate adsorption of O-2 on an
   isolated Pd monomer, the pairing of Pd monomers allows O-2 adsorption in
   a bidentate configuration and consequently facilitating O-O bond
   scission. However, the barrier for OH hydrogenation at each Pd site
   shows no significant change between the isolated and paired cases, while
   it is noticeably lower than the pure Pd case. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Time-reversal symmetries impose stringent constraints on emission and
   absorption. Antennas, from radiofrequencies to optics, are bound to
   transmit and receive signals equally well from the same direction,
   making a directive antenna prone to receive echoes and reflections.
   Similarly, in thermodynamics Kirchhoff's law dictates that the
   absorptivity and emissivity are bound to be equal in reciprocal systems
   at equilibrium, e(omega,theta)=a(omega,theta), with important
   consequences for thermal management and energy applications. This bound
   requires that a good absorber emits a portion of the absorbed energy
   back to the source, limiting its overall efficiency. Recent works have
   shown that weak time modulation or mechanical motion in suitably
   designed structures may largely break reciprocity and time-reversal
   symmetry. Here we show theoretically and experimentally that a
   spatiotemporally modulated device can be designed to have drastically
   different emission and absorption properties. The proposed concept may
   provide significant advances for compact and efficient radiofrequency
   communication systems, as well as for energy harvesting and thermal
   management when translated to infrared frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the vibrational properties and Raman spectra of Si-Ge
   core-shell nanostructures using real-space pseudopotentials constructed
   within density functional theory. Our method uses no empirical
   parameters, unlike many popular methods for predicting Raman spectra for
   nanocrystals. We find the dominant features of the Raman spectrum for
   the Si-Ge core-shell structure to be a superposition of the Raman
   spectra of the Ge and Si nanocrystals with optical peaks around 300 and
   500 cm(-1), respectively. We also find a Si-Ge ``interface{''} peak at
   400 cm(-1). The Ge shell causes the Si core to expand from the
   equilibrium structure. This strain induces significant redshift in the
   Si contribution to the vibrational and Raman spectra, while the Ge shell
   is largely unstrained and does not exhibit this shift. We find that the
   ratio of peak heights is strongly related to the relative size of the
   core and shell regions. This finding suggests that Raman spectroscopy
   may be used to characterize the size of the core and shell in these
   structures. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy has been widely used to measure thermal conductivity
   (kappa) of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene. This method
   is based on a well-accepted assumption that different phonon
   polarizations are in near thermal equilibrium. However, in this paper,
   we show that, in laser-irradiated single-layer graphene, different
   phonon polarizations are in strong nonequilibrium, using predictive
   simulations based on first principles density functional perturbation
   theory and a multitemperature model. We first calculate the electron
   cooling rate due to phonon scattering as a function of the electron and
   phonon temperatures, and the results clearly illustrate that optical
   phonons dominate the hot electron relaxation process. We then use these
   results in conjunction with the phonon scattering rates computed using
   perturbation theory to develop a multitemperature model and resolve the
   spatial temperature distributions of the energy carriers in graphene
   under steady-state laser irradiation. Our results show that electrons,
   optical phonons, and acoustic phonons are in strong nonequilibrium, with
   the flexural acoustic (ZA) phonons showing the largest nonequilibrium to
   other phonon modes, mainly due to their weak coupling to other carriers
   in suspended graphene. Since ZA phonons are the main heat carriers in
   graphene, we estimate that neglecting this nonequilibrium leads to
   underestimation of thermal conductivity in experiments at room
   temperature by a factor of 1.35 to 2.6, depending on experimental
   conditions and assumptions used. Underestimation is also expected in
   Raman measurements of other 2D materials when the optical-acoustic
   phonon coupling is weak.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a unified framework to address the problem of
   optimal nonlinear analysis and feedback control for partial stability
   and partial-state stabilization. Partial asymptotic stability of the
   closed-loop nonlinear system is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov
   function that is positive definite and decrescent with respect to part
   of the system state, which can clearly be seen to be the solution to the
   steady-state form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and hence
   guaranteeing both partial stability and optimality. The overall
   framework provides the foundation for extending optimal linear-quadratic
   controller synthesis to nonlinear nonquadratic optimal partial-state
   stabilization. Connections to optimal linear and nonlinear regulation
   for linear and nonlinear time-varying systems with quadratic and
   nonlinear nonquadratic cost functionals are also provided. Finally, we
   also develop optimal feedback controllers for affine nonlinear systems
   using an inverse optimality framework tailored to the partial-state
   stabilization problem and use this result to address polynomial and
   multilinear forms in the performance criterion. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Abstract = {{In this article we describe the unique insights into the electronic
   structure of molecules provided by generalized valence bond (GVB)
   theory. We consider selected prototypical hydrocarbons as well as a
   number of hypervalent molecules and a set of first- and second-row
   valence isoelectronic species. The GVB wave function is obtained by
   variationally optimizing the orbitals and spin coupling in the valence
   bond wave function. The GVB wave function is a generalization of the
   Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function, lifting the double occupancy
   restriction on a subset of the HF orbitals as well as the associated
   orthogonality and spin coupling constraints. The GVB wave function
   includes a major fraction (if not all) of the nondynamical correlation
   energy of a molecule. Because of this, GVB theory properly describes
   bond formation and can answer one of the most compelling questions in
   chemistry: How are atoms changed by molecular formation? We show that
   GVB theory provides a unified description of the nature of the bonding
   in all of the above molecular species as well as contributing new
   insights into the well-known, but poorly understood, first-row anomaly.}},

Abstract = {{Nature has engineered universal, catechol-containing adhesives which can
   be synthetically mimicked in the form of polydopamine (PDA). In this
   study, PDA was exploited to enable the formation of block copolymer
   (BCP) nanopatterns on a variety of soft material surfaces. While
   conventional PDA coating times (1 h) produce a layer too rough for most
   applications of BCP nanopatterning, we found that these substrates could
   be polished by bath sonication in a weakly basic solution to form a
   conformal, smooth (root-mean-square roughness similar to 0.4 nm), and
   thin (3 nm) layer free of large prominent granules. This chemically
   functionalized, biomimetic layer served as a reactive platform for
   subsequently grafting a surface neutral layer of
   poly(styrene-random-methyl methacrylate-random-glycidyl methacrylate) to
   perpendicularly orient lamellae-forming poly(styrene-block-methyl
   methacrylate) BCP. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy observations
   confirmed that a BCP nanopattem on a poly(ethylene terephthalate)
   substrate was not affected by bending with a radius of similar to 0.5
   cm. This procedure enables nondestructive, plasma-free surface
   modification of chemically inert, low-surface energy soft materials,
   thus overcoming many current chemical and physical limitations that may
   impede high throughput, roll-to-roll nanomanufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Hydration is central to mitigating surface fouling by oil and
   microorganisms. Immobilization of hydrophilic polymers on surfaces
   promotes retention of water and a reduction of direct interactions with
   potential foulants. While conventional surface modification techniques
   are surface-specific, mussel-inspired adhesives based on dopamine
   effectively coat many types of surfaces and thus hold potential as a
   universal solution to surface modification. Here, a facile, one-step
   surface modification strategy is described that affords hydrophilic, and
   underwater superoleophobic, coatings by the simultaneous deposition of
   polydopamine (PDA) with poly(methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)
   (polyMPC). The resultant composite coating features enhanced
   hydrophilicity (i.e., water contact angle of approximate to 10 degrees
   in air) and antifouling performance relative to PDA coatings. PolyMPC
   affords control over coating thickness and surface roughness and results
   in a nearly tenfold reduction in Escherichia coli adhesion relative to
   unmodified glass. The substrate-independent nature of PDA coatings
   further promotes facile surface modification without tedious surface
   pretreatment and offers a robust template for codepositing polyMPC to
   enhance biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and fouling resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The loss of centrosymmetry via oxygen octahedral rotations is
   demonstrated in the n = 2 Dion-Jacobson family of layered oxide
   perovskites, A'LaB2O7 (A' = Rb, Cs; B = Nb, Ta). Ab initio density
   functional theory calculations predict that all four materials should
   adopt polar space groups, in contrast to the results of previous
   experimental studies that have assigned these materials to the
   centrosymmetric P4/mmm space group. Optical second harmonic generation
   experiments confirm the presence of a noncentrosymmetric phase at
   ambient temperature. Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments also
   show that this phase is piezoelectric. To elucidate the
   symmetry-breaking and assign the appropriate space groups, the crystal
   structure of CsLaNb2O7 is refined as a function of temperature from
   synchrotron X-ray diffraction data. Above 550 K, CsLaNb2O7 adopts the
   previously determined centrosymmetric P4/mmm space group. Between 550
   and 350 K, the symmetry is lowered to the noncentrosymmetric space group
   Amm2. Below 350 K, additional symmetry lowering is observed as peak
   splitting, but the space group cannot be unambiguously identified.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to enlarge the normal spinel phase diagram for the

   temperatures (150-210 degrees C) of layered Li-0.5(Ni1-y-zMnyCoz)O-2 (R

   of lithium from Li-0.5(Ni1-y-zMnyCoz)O-2, into normal spinel-like (Fd
   (3) over barm) Li(Ni1-y-zMnyCoz)(2)O-4 has been investigated. The
   phase-conversion mechanism has been studied by joint time-of-flight
   (TOF) neutron and X-ray diffractions, thermogravimetric analysis, and
   bond valence sum map. The ionic diffusion of lithium (3a, 6c) and nickel
   (3a, 3b) ions has been quantified as a function of temperature. The
   investigated spinel phases are metastable, and they are subject to
   change into rock-salt phases at higher temperatures. The phases have
   been characterized as cathodes in lithium-ion cells. The study may serve
   as a strategic model to access other metastable phases by
   low-temperature synthesis approaches.}},

Title = {{Aliovalent Substitution of V3+ for Co2+ in LiCoPO4 by a Low-Temperature

Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Electrical and ionic conductivity has proven to be a major limiting
   factor in the adoption of high-voltage polyanion cathode materials,
   specifically LiMPO4 (M = Mn, Co, Ni). While the aliovalent substitution
   of V3+ for Fe2+ in LiFePO4 has been shown recently, no conclusive
   evidence is available for aliovalent substitutions in the analogous
   LiCoPO4. This study presents a low-temperature microwave-assisted
   solvothermal synthesis and characterization of aliovalently substituted
   LiCo1-3sx/2Vx square x/2PO4 for x <= 0.07. The as synthesized
   LiCo1-3x/2Vx square x/2PO4 samples belonging to the Pn2(1)a space group
   are transformed to the Pnma polymorph via calcination in an inert
   atmosphere at 525 degrees C. The LiCo1-3x/2Vx square x/2PO4 samples are
   characterized with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction,
   Rietveld refinement, inductively coupled plasma optical emissions
   spectroscopy, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, galvanostatic
   charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic
   voltammetry. Unlike the prior reports of aliovalent substitution via
   high-temperature methods, the LiCo1-3x/2Vx square x/2PO4 samples
   presented here experienced a systematic decrease in the unit cell volume
   with increasing vanadium substitution. The electrochemical performance
   and cyclability of LiCo1-3x/2Vx square x/2PO4 is greatly improved
   compared to the unsubstituted LiCoPO4.}},

Title = {{Size-dependent properties of silica nanoparticles for Pickering
   stabilization of emulsions and foams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are a promising alternative to surfactants to stabilize
   emulsions or foams in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes due to their
   effectiveness in very harsh environments found in many of the oilfields
   around the world. While the size-dependent properties of nanoparticles
   have been extensively studied in the area of optics or cellular uptake,
   little is known on the effects of nanoparticle size on emulsion/foam
   generation, especially for EOR applications. In this study, silica
   nanoparticles with four different sizes (5, 12, 25, and 80 nm nominal
   diameter) but with the same surface treatment were employed to test
   their emulsion or foam generation behavior in high-salinity conditions.
   The decane-in-brine emulsion generated by sonication or flowing through
   sandpack showed smaller droplet size and higher apparent viscosity as
   the nanoparticle size decreased. Similarly, the CO2-in-brine foam
   generation in sandstone or sandpacks was also significantly affected by
   the nanoparticle size, exhibiting higher apparent foam viscosity as the
   nanoparticle size decreased. In case of foam generation in sandstone
   cores with 5 nm nanoparticles, a noticeable hysteresis occurred when the
   flow velocity was initially increased and then decreased, implying a
   strong foam generation initially; and then the trapping of the generated
   foam in the rock pores, as the flow velocity decreased. On the other
   hand, weak foams stabilized with larger nanoparticles indicated a rapid
   coalescence of bubbles which prevented foam generation. Overall, stable
   emulsions/foams were achievable by the smaller particles as a result of
   greater diffusivity and/or higher number concentration, thus allowing
   more nanoparticles with higher surface area to volume ratio to be
   adsorbed at the fluid/fluid interfaces of the emulsion/foam dispersion.}},

Abstract = {{Elucidating the relationship between chemical structure, morphology, and
   ionic conductivity is essential for designing novel high-performance
   materials for electrochemical applications. In this work, the effect of
   lamellar domain spacing (d) on ionic conductivity (sigma) is
   investigated for a model system of hydrated diblock copolymer based on a
   protic polymerized ionic liquid. We present a strategy that allows for
   the synthesis of a well-defined series of narrowly dispersed PS-b-PIL
   with constant volume fraction of ionic liquid moieties (f(IL)
   approximate to 0.39) and with two types of mobile charge carriers:
   trifluoroacetate anions and protons. These materials self-assemble into
   ordered lamellar morphologies with variable domain spacing (ca. 20-70
   nm) as demonstrated by small-angle X-ray scattering. PS-b-PIL membranes
   exhibit ionic conductivities above 10(-4) S/cm at room temperature,
   which are independent of domain spacing consistent with their nearly
   identical water content. The conductivity scaling relationship
   demonstrated in this paper suggests that a mechanically robust membrane
   can be designed without compromising its ability to transport ions. In
   addition, PIL-based membranes exhibit low water uptake (lambda
   approximate to 10) in comparison with many proton-conducting systems
   reported elsewhere. The low water content of the materials described
   herein makes them promising candidates for electrochemical devices
   operating in aqueous electrolytes at low current densities where
   moderate ion conduction and low product crossover are required.}},

Title = {{Effect of UV irradiation and physical aging on O-2 and N-2 transport

Abstract = {{Modification of membranes to improve gas separation properties has been
   of considerable interest. Crosslinking is one route to modify membranes,
   but such studies need to be performed on thin membranes to quantify the
   impact of such modifications at thicknesses relevant to industrial
   membranes. In this study, the influences of UV irradiation and physical
   aging on O-2 and N-2 gas permeation properties of thin (similar to 150
   nm) glassy, amorphous poly(arylene ether ketone) (PAEK) copolymer films
   at 35 degrees C and 2 atm were investigated. Thin PAEK copolymer films,
   prepared from tetramethyl bisphenol A (TMBPA) and
   4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (DFBP), were UV irradiated on both sides in
   air or N-2 at 254 nm or 365 nm, which induced crosslinking and, in some
   cases, photooxidation. Gas permeability decreased and O-2/N-2
   selectivity increased as UV irradiation and aging time increased. At 254
   nm, samples irradiated in air have lower permeability coefficients and
   higher selectivities than samples irradiated in N-2,N- which was
   ascribed to additional decreases in free volume due to photooxidation in
   samples irradiated in air. Additionally, samples irradiated in air at
   254 nm exhibit less physical aging than uncrosslinked and samples
   irradiated in N-2 at 254 nm, possibly due to interactions among
   photooxidative polar products that may restrict polymer chain mobility,
   thereby lowering the aging rate. The influence of water vapor on
   physical aging of samples irradiated in air was examined. Finally,
   irradiation at 254 nm leads to more extensive crosslinking and/or
   photooxidation than irradiation at 365 nm, possibly due to greater UV
   absorption by the polymer and the higher probability of radical
   formation at the lower wavelength. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Achieving damage-free, uniform, abrupt, ultra-shallow junctions while
   simultaneously controlling the doping concentration on the nanoscale is
   an ongoing challenge to the scaling down of electronic device
   dimensions. Here, we demonstrate a simple method of effectively doping
   III-V compound semiconductors, specifically InGaAs, by a solid phase
   doping source. This method is based on the in-diffusion of oxygen and/or
   silicon from a deposited non-stoichiometric silicon dioxide (SiOx) film
   on InGaAs, which then acts as donors upon activation by annealing. The
   dopant profile and concentration can be controlled by the deposited film
   thickness and thermal annealing parameters, giving active carrier
   concentration of 1.4 x 10(18) cm(-3). Our results also indicate that
   conventional silicon based processes must be carefully reviewed for
   compound semiconductor device fabrication to prevent unintended doping.

Abstract = {{Gradient metasurfaces have recently been demonstrated to provide control
   of the phase of scattered fields over sub-wavelength scales, enabling a
   broad range of linear optical components in a flat, ultrathin,
   integrable platform. Additionally, the development of nonlinear
   metasurfaces has disrupted conventional nonlinear optical device design
   by relaxing phase matching constraints, reducing size and
   dimensionality, and providing record values of localized nonlinear
   responses. However, extending the ``flat optics{''} paradigm to the
   nonlinear case faces important challenges, since we are required to
   simultaneously achieve efficient frequency conversion and
   sub-diffractive phase control. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
   continuous phase control of the giant nonlinear second harmonic optical
   response from metasurfaces tied to intersubband transitions in
   semiconductor multi-quantum wells, establishing an exciting path toward
   realizing the vision of flat, nonlinear optics. (C) 2016 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Engineering a bimetallic system with complementary chemical properties
   can be an effective way of tuning catalytic activity. In this work, CO
   oxidation on CeO2(111)-supported Pd-based bimetallic nanorods was
   investigated using density functional theory calculations corrected by
   on-site Coulomb interactions. We studied a series of CeO2(111)-supported
   Pd-based bimetallic nanorods (Pd-X, where X = Ag, Au, Cu, Pt, Rh, Ru)
   and found that Pd-Ag/CeO2 and Pd-Cu/CeO2 are the two systems where the
   binding sites of CO and O-2 are distinct; that is, in these two systems,
   CO and O-2 do not compete for the same binding sites. An analysis of the
   CO oxidation mechanisms suggests that the Pd-Ag/CeO2 system is more
   effective for catalyzing CO oxidation as compared to Pd-Cu/CeO2 because
   both CeO2 lattice oxygen atoms and adsorbed oxygen molecules at Ag sites
   can oxidize CO with low energy barriers. Both the Pd-Ag and PdCeO2
   interfaces in Pd-Ag/CeO2 were found to play important roles in CO
   oxidation. The Pd-Ag interface, which combines the different chemical
   nature of the two metals, not only separates the binding sites of CO and
   O-2 but also opens up active reaction pathways for CO oxidation. The
   strong metal-support interaction at the Pd-CeO2 interface facilitates CO
   oxidation by the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Our study provides
   theoretical guidance for designing highly active metal/oxide catalysts
   for CO oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, Ni-doped manganite perovskite oxides
   (La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xNixO3, x = 0.2 and 0.4) and undoped La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 were
   synthesized via a general and facile sol gel route and used as
   bifunctional catalysts for oxygen cathode in rechargeable lithium air
   batteries. The structural and compositional characterization results
   showed that the obtained La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xNixO3 (x = 0.2 and 0.4)
   contained more oxygen vacancies than did the undoped La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 as
   well as a certain amount of Ni3+ (e(g) = 1) on their surface. The
   Ni-doped La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xNixO3 (x = 0.2 and 0.4)-was provided with higher
   bifunctional catalytic activities than that of the undoped La0
   8Sr0.2MnO3. In particular, the La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.6Ni0.4O3 had a lower total
   over potential between the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen
   reduction reaction than that of the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, and the value is
   even comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C yet is provided with a
   much reduced cost. In the lithium air battery, oxygen cathodes
   containing the La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.6Ni0.4O3 catalyst delivered the optimized
   electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity and cycle
   life, and a reasonable reaction mechanism was given to explain the
   improved performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the change of light transmittance and light
   scattering dispersion by colloidal suspensions of magnetic
   nanoparticles. Optical changes were observed during the application of
   transversal magnetic fields to magnetic nanoparticles and nanowires at
   concentrations spanning from 20 mu g/mL to 2 ng/mL. Results show that
   light scattering modulation is a simple, fast and inexpensive method for
   detection of magnetic nanoparticles at low concentrations. Frequency and
   time response of the optical modulation strongly depends on the geometry
   of the particles. In this regard, light transmittance and scattering
   measurements may prove useful in characterizing the morphology of
   suspended nanoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mantle cloaking for co-site radio-frequency antennas}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{108}},

Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{We show that properly designed mantle cloaks, consisting of patterned
   metallic sheets placed around cylindrical monopoles, allow tightly
   packing the same antennas together in a highly dense telecommunication
   platform. Our experimental demonstration is applied to the relevant
   example of two cylindrical monopole radiators operating for 3G and 4G
   mobile communications. The two antennas are placed in close proximity,
   separated by 1/10 of the shorter operational wavelength, and, after
   cloaking, are shown to remarkably operate as if isolated in free-space.
   This result paves the way to unprecedented co-siting strategies for
   multiple antennas handling different services and installed in
   overcrowded platforms, such as communication towers, satellite payloads,
   aircrafts, or ship trees. More broadly, this work presents a significant
   application of cloaking technology to improve the efficiency of modern
   communication systems. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur batteries offer high energy density, but their practical
   utility is plagued by the fast decay of lithium-metal anode upon
   cycling. To date, a fundamental understanding of the degradation
   mechanisms of lithium-metal anode is lacking. It is shown that (i) by
   employing a specifically designed electrolyte, the lithium-metal anode
   degradation can be significantly reduced, resulting in a superior,
   high-rate battery performance and (ii) by combining advanced, 3D
   chemical analysis with X-ray diffraction, the properties of the
   lithium-metal anode can be effectively monitored as a function of
   cycling, which is critical in understanding its degradation mechanisms.
   These findings suggest that the crystallinity of the impurity phases
   formed in the lithium-metal anode via chemical reactions with the
   electrolyte is the dominant degradation factor. It is shown both
   experimentally and by computational modeling that by employing
   electrolyte additives containing metal ions that have lower reactivity
   with sulfur than lithium (e.g., copper, silver, and gold), the
   crystallinity of the impurity phases can be significantly reduced,
   resulting in a stable lithium-metal anode. A pathway to develop a
   practical, affordable, environmentally compatible, rechargeable Li-S
   battery system is offered, and insights to develop other
   high-energy-density battery systems based on the high-capacity
   lithium-metal anode are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadyl phosphates (VOPO4) represent a class of attractive cathodes in
   lithium-ion batteries. However, the exploration of this type of
   materials in sodium-ion batteries is rare. Here, we report for the first
   time the synthesis of orthorhombic beta-NaVOPO4 by first chemically
   extracting lithium from beta-LiVOPO4 and then inserting sodium into the
   obtained beta-VOPO4 by a microwave-assisted solvothermal process with
   NaI, which serves both as a reducing agent and sodium source.
   Intermediate NaxVOPO4 compositions with x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 have also
   been obtained by controlling the amount of NaI in the reaction mixture.
   Joint Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   neutron diffraction confirms that the fully sodiated beta-NaVOPO4 is
   isostructural with the lithium counterpart beta-LiVOPO4. Bond valence
   sum maps suggest that sodium ions possibly diffuse along the {[}010]
   direction in the lattice, similar to the ionic conduction pathway in
   beta-LiVOPO4. Although the initial discharge capacity is low due to the
   protons in the structure, it steadily increases with cycling with a long
   plateau at 3.3 V. Ex situ XRD data of cycled beta-VOPO4 and beta-NaVOPO4
   electrodes confirm the reversible reaction in sodium cells involving the
   V4+/V5+ redox couple.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops synthetic strategies for N,N-trans and N,N-cis

   coordination spheres and ligand structures on ancillary ligand exchange
   dynamics and catalytic perchlorate reduction activities of the
   corresponding {[}Re(O)(LO-N)(2)](+) cations. The
   2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxazoline (Hhoz) and
   2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-thiazoline (Hhtz) ligands are used to prepare
   homoleptic N,N-trans and N,N-cis isomers of both Re(O)(hoz)(2)Cl and
   Re(O)(htz)(2)Cl and one heteroleptic N,N-trans Re(O)(hoz)(htz)Cl.
   Selection of hoz/htz ligands determines the preferred isomeric
   coordination sphere, and the use of substituted pyridine bases with
   varying degrees of steric hindrance during complex synthesis controls
   the rate of isomer interconversion. The five corresponding
   {[}Re(O)(LO-N)(2)](+) cations exhibit a wide range of solvent exchange
   rates (1.4 to 24,000 s(-1) at 25 degrees C) and different LO-N movement
   patterns, as influenced by the coordination sphere of Re (trans/cis),
   the noncoordinating heteroatom on LO-N ligands (O/S), and the
   combination of the two LO-N ligands (homoleptic/heteroleptic). Ligand
   exchange dynamics also correlate with the activity of catalytic
   reduction of aqueous ClO4- by H-2 when the Re(O)(LO-N)(2)Cl complexes
   are immobilized onto Pd/C. Findings from this study provide novel
   synthetic strategies and mechanistic insights for innovations in
   catalytic, environmental, and biomedical research.}},

   in these systems, which constitute a simple model for the behavior of
   glasses and some biomaterials. Even though there are significant
   computational challenges present in these systems due to the large
   number of metastable states, the Milestoning method is able to compute
   their kinetic and thermodynamic properties exactly. We observe two
   clearly distinguished regimes in the overall kinetics: one in which
   diffusive behavior dominates and another that follows an Arrhenius law
   (despite the absence of a dominant barrier). We compare our results with
   those obtained with an exactly-solvable one-dimensional model, and with
   the results from the rough one-dimensional energy model introduced by

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{623-634}},

Abstract = {{We address a minimum-time problem that constitutes an extension of the
   classical Zermelo navigation problem in higher dimensions. In
   particular, we address the problem of steering a self-propelled particle
   to a prescribed terminal position with free terminal velocity in the
   presence of a spatiotemporal flow field. Furthermore, we assume that the
   norm of the rate of change of the particle's velocity relative to the
   flow is upper bounded by an explicit upper bound. To address the
   problem, we first employ Pontryagin's minimum principle to parameterise
   the set of candidate time-optimal control laws in terms of a parameter
   vector that belongs to a compact set. Subsequently, we develop a simple
   numerical algorithm for the computation of the minimum time-to-come
   function that is tailored to the particular parametrisation of the set
   of the candidate time-optimal control laws of our problem. The proposed
   approach bypasses the task of converting the optimal control problem to
   a parameter optimisation problem, which can be computationally intense,
   especially when one is interested in characterising the optimal
   synthesis of the minimum-time problem. Numerical simulations that
   illustrate the theoretical developments are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Germanium (Ge)-based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
   are a promising candidate for high performance, low power electronics at
   the 7 nm technology node and beyond. However, the availability of high
   quality gate oxide/Ge interfaces that provide low leakage current
   density and equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), robust scalability, and
   acceptable interface state density (D-it,) has emerged as one of the
   most challenging hurdles in the development of such devices. Here we
   demonstrate and present detailed electrical characterization of a
   high-kappa epitaxial oxide gate stack based on crystalline SrHfO3 grown
   on Ge (001) by atomic layer deposition. Metal-oxide-Ge capacitor
   structures show extremely low gate leakage, small and scalable EOT, and
   good and reducible D-it. Detailed growth strategies and postgrowth
   annealing schemes are demonstrated to reduce D-it. The physical
   mechanisms behind these phenomena are studied and suggest approaches for
   further reduction of D-it.}},

Abstract = {{The anchorage of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips using
   CFRP anchors is gaining acceptance in strengthening applications of
   concrete members. CFRP anchors can fully develop the strength of CFRP
   strips when adequately detailed. However, parameters that influence the
   behavior and strength of CFRP strips and anchors are not well
   understood. In this study, 26 tests on concrete beams were conducted to
   study the influence of five key parameters on CFRP anchor effectiveness:
   1) the width of the anchored CFRP strip; 2) the material ratio of CFRP
   anchor to CFRP strip; 3) the concrete strength; 4) the length/angle of
   anchor fan; and 5) the bond condition between a CFRP strip and concrete.
   Results indicate that narrow anchored CFRP strips developed higher
   stresses at fracture than wide strips and required smaller anchor
   material ratios to be fully developed. Test results provide valuable
   data for designing anchored CFRP strengthening systems.}},

   upturn in the middle and late sections, and the curves turn more upward
   with the severer of the variable-permeability effect. The severer the
   non-Darcy effect is, the less obviously the curve upturns caused by
   boundary effect. Furthermore, the boundary effect is increased by
   increasing the number of impermeable boundaries or decreasing the

Title = {{Cryotherapy-Induced Persistent Vasoconstriction After Cutaneous Cooling:

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to investigate the persistence of
   cold-induced vasoconstriction following cessation of active skin-surface
   cooling. This study demonstrates a hysteresis effect that develops
   between skin temperature and blood perfusion during the cooling and
   subsequent rewarming period. An Arctic Ice cryotherapy unit (CTU) was
   applied to the knee region of six healthy subjects for 60 min of active
   cooling followed by 120 min of passive rewarming. Multiple laser Doppler
   flowmetry perfusion probes were used to measure skin blood flow
   (expressed as cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC)). Skin surface
   cooling produced a significant reduction in CVC (P < 0.001) that
   persisted throughout the duration of the rewarming period. In addition,
   there was a hysteresis effect between CVC and skin temperature during
   the cooling and subsequent rewarming cycle (P < 0.01). Mixed model
   regression (MMR) showed a significant difference in the slopes of the
   CVC-skin temperature curves during cooling and rewarming (P < 0.001).
   Piecewise regression was used to investigate the temperature thresholds
   for acceleration of CVC during the cooling and rewarming periods. The
   two thresholds were shown to be significantly different (P = 0.003). The
   results show that localized cooling causes significant vasoconstriction
   that continues beyond the active cooling period despite skin
   temperatures returning toward baseline values. The significant and
   persistent reduction in skin perfusion may contribute to nonfreezing
   cold injury (NFCI) associated with cryotherapy.}},

Title = {{Inversion-based interpretation of borehole sonic measurements using

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{D111-D124}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in the interpretation of sonic logs is the
   presence of bed-boundary (shoulder-bed) effects, which can decrease the
   accuracy of the estimated elastic properties due to spatial averaging
   caused by the sonic receiver array across thin beds. A reliable approach
   to account for shoulder-bed effects in the interpretation of sonic logs
   is the implementation of forward modeling and inversion techniques. We
   have developed an efficient inversion-based interpretation method for
   the estimation of in situ rock formation elastic properties from sonic
   logs acquired in vertical wells. The method uses semianalytical spatial
   sensitivity functions for fast forward modeling of sonic-slowness logs
   and estimates formation elastic properties by iteratively matching the
   available logs with numerical simulations. Due to the intrinsic vertical
   resolution limits of sonic logs, the inversion method requires
   predefined bed boundaries using other high-resolution well logs. We
   first developed a workflow to estimate shear slowness of thin beds from
   flexural mode dispersions measured at multiple discrete frequencies.
   Then, we extended the method to estimate layer-by-layer compressional
   and shear slownesses by combining the slowness logs of nondispersive P-
   and S-waves. The method was first successfully verified using data
   numerically simulated for synthetic rock formations consisting of
   multiple thin beds and exhibiting large elastic property contrasts.
   Maximum relative errors and maximum uncertainty in the estimates were
   less than 2\% and 6\%, respectively. Field data acquired in wells
   penetrating multiple horizontal thin beds were also used to appraise the
   reliability and resolution improvement of the method in the estimation
   of formation compressional and shear slownesses. Our results indicated
   that our inversion-based interpretation method improved the vertical
   resolution of sonic logs by 70\%. The new inversion-based interpretation
   method opens up the possibility of integrating modern borehole acoustic
   measurements with nuclear and resistivity logs for improved poroelastic
   and petrophysical interpretations.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon-bearing conventional formations, mudrock formations, and
   source-rock formations generally contain clays, pyrite, magnetite,
   graphitelike carbon, and/or other electrically conductive mineral
   inclusions. Under redox-inactive conditions, these inclusions give rise
   to perfectly polarized interfacial polarization (PPIP) when subjected to
   an external electric field. Effective electrical conductivity and
   dielectric permittivity of geomaterials containing such inclusions are
   frequency-dependent properties due to the electric-field-induced
   interfacial polarization and associated charge relaxation around
   host-inclusion interfaces. Existing resistivity interpretation
   techniques do not account for PPIP phenomena, and hence they can lead to
   inaccurate estimation of water saturation, total organic content, and
   conductivity of formation water based on subsurface galvanic
   resistivity, electromagnetic (EM) induction, and EM propagation
   measurements in the presence of conductive mineral inclusions. In the
   first paper of our two-part publication series, we derived a mechanistic
   electrochemical model, the PPIP model, and we validated a coupled model
   that integrates the PPIP model with a surface-conductance-assisted
   interfacial polarization (SCAIP) model to quantify the
   frequency-dependent electrical complex conductivity of geomaterials. We
   have used the PPIP-SCAIP model to evaluate the dependence of effective
   complex-valued conductivity of geologic mixtures on (1) frequency, (2)
   conductivity of the host medium, and (3) material, size, and the shape
   of inclusions. Notably, we have used the PPIP-SCAIP model to identify
   rock conditions that give rise to significant differences in effective
   conductivity and effective relative permittivity of
   conductive-inclusion-bearing mixtures from those of
   conductive-inclusion-free homogeneous media. For a mixture containing as
   low as a 5\% volume fraction of disseminated conductive inclusions, the
   low-frequency effective conductivity of the mixture is in the range of
   -30\% to +100\% with respect to the host conductivity for frequencies
   between 100 Hz and 100 kHz. Further, the high-frequency effective
   relative permittivity of that mixture is in the range of -10\% to +90\%
   with respect to the host relative permittivity for frequencies between
   100 kHz and 10 MHz.}},

Title = {{Interfacial polarization of disseminated conductive minerals in absence

Abstract = {{Electrically conductive mineral inclusions are commonly present in
   organic-rich mudrock and source-rock formations such as veins,
   laminations, rods, grains, flakes, and beds. Laboratory and subsurface
   electromagnetic (EM) measurements performed on geomaterials containing
   electrically conductive inclusions generally exhibit frequency
   dispersion due to interfacial polarization phenomena at host-inclusion
   interfaces. In the absence of redox-active species, surfaces of
   electrically conductive mineral inclusions are impermeable to the
   transport of charge carriers, inhibit the exchange of charges and behave
   as perfectly polarized (PP) interfaces under the influence of an
   externally applied EM field. Interfacial polarization phenomena
   involving charge separation, migration, accumulation/depletion, and
   relaxation around PP interfaces is referred to as PP interfacial
   polarization; it influences the magnitude and direction of the electric
   field and charge carrier migration in the geomaterial. We have developed
   a mechanistic model to quantify the complex-valued electrical
   conductivity response of geomaterials containing electrically conductive
   mineral inclusions, such as pyrite and magnetite, uniformly distributed
   in a fluid-filled, porous matrix made of nonconductive grains possessing
   surface conductance, such as silica and clay grains. The model first
   uses a linear approximation of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations of
   dilute solution theory to determine the induced dipole moment of a
   single isolated conductive inclusion and that of a single isolated
   nonconductive grain surrounded by an electrolyte. A consistent
   effective-medium formulation was then implemented to determine the
   effective complex-valued electrical conductivity of the geomaterial.
   Model predictions were in good agreement with laboratory measurements of
   multifrequency complex-valued electrical conductivity, relaxation time,
   and chargeability of mixtures containing electrically conductive
   inclusions.}},

Title = {{Controlling sound with acoustic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Acoustic metamaterials can manipulate and control sound waves in ways
   that are not possible in conventional materials. Metamaterials with
   zero, or even negative, refractive index for sound offer new
   possibilities for acoustic imaging and for the control of sound at
   subwavelength scales. The combination of transformation acoustics theory
   and highly anisotropic acoustic metamaterials enables precise control
   over the deformation of sound fields, which can be used, for example, to
   hide or cloak objects from incident acoustic energy. Active acoustic
   metamaterials use external control to create effective material
   properties that are not possible with passive structures and have led to
   the development of dynamically reconfigurable, loss-compensating and
   parity-time-symmetric materials for sound manipulation. Challenges
   remain, including the development of efficient techniques for
   fabricating large-scale metamaterial structures and converting
   laboratory experiments into useful devices. In this Review, we outline
   the designs and properties of materials with unusual acoustic parameters
   (for example, negative refractive index), discuss examples of extreme
   manipulation of sound and, finally, provide an overview of future
   directions in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since the inception of mobile telephony, the downlink and uplink of
   cellular networks have been coupled, that is, mobile terminals have been
   constrained to associate with the same base station in both the downlink
   and uplink directions. New trends in network densification and mobile
   data usage increase the drawbacks of this constraint, and suggest that
   it should be revisited. In this article we identify and explain five key
   arguments in favor of downlink/uplink decoupling based on a blend of
   theoretical, experimental, and architectural insights. We then overview
   the changes needed in current LTE-A mobile systems to enable this
   decoupling, and then look ahead to fifth generation cellular standards.
   We demonstrate that decoupling can lead to significant gains in network
   throughput, outage, and power consumption at a much lower cost compared
   to other solutions that provide comparable or lower gains.}},

   low-pressure plasma}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The influence of emitter temperature on the energy deposition into
   low-pressure plasma is studied by the self-consistent one-dimensional
   Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Collisions model. Depending on the emitter
   temperature, different modes of discharge operation are obtained. The
   mode type depends on the plasma frequency and does not depend on the
   ratio between the densities of beam and plasma electrons. Namely, plasma
   is stable when the plasma frequency is small. For this plasma, the
   energy transfer from emitted electrons to plasma electrons is
   inefficient. The increase in the plasma frequency results first in the
   excitation of two-stream electron instability. However, since the
   thermal velocity of plasma electrons is smaller than the electrostatic
   wave velocity, the resonant wave-particle interaction is inefficient for
   the energy deposition into the plasma. Further increase in the plasma
   frequency leads to the distortion of beam of emitted electrons. Then,
   the electrostatic wave generated due to two-stream instability decays
   into multiple slower waves. Phase velocities of these waves are
   comparable with the thermal velocity of plasma electrons which makes
   possible the resonant wave-particle interaction. This results in the
   efficient energy deposition from emitted electrons into the plasma. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel design for a fused floating-point four-term
   dot product unit. The dot product is one of the most frequently used
   operations for a wide variety of graphics, digital signal processing
   (DSP) and statistical applications. The proposed design computes the
   four-term dot product in a single unit to achieve better performance and
   accuracy compared to a network of traditional floating-point multipliers
   and adders, which is referred to as a discrete design. In order to
   further improve the performance of the fused floating-point four-term
   dot product unit, a new exponent compare and significand alignment
   scheme, dual-reduction, early normalization, four-input Leading Zero
   Anticipation (LZA), and compound addition and rounding are applied. The
   proposed design is implemented for both single and double precision and
   synthesized with a 45 nm CMOS standard-cell library. In order to
   evaluate the improvement of the proposed design, the area, latency, and
   power consumption are investigated. The proposed design reduces the
   area, power consumption and latency by about 40\% compared to the
   discrete design.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to their roles in protein biosynthesis, components of
   cellular ribosomes perform roles that contribute to a number of
   important cellular processes. Exploitation of processes has led to the
   use of ribosomal parts as solubility enhancer partners and purification
   matrices in protein expression. In this work, an engineered version of
   the E. coli ribosomal protein L29 (L4H2) as a fusion partner for
   enhancing cellular expression of proteins that are poorly expressed in
   bacteria was exploited. It was demonstrated that a chimeric fusion of
   L4H2 with various Fc receptors increases total expression up to
   3.2-fold, relative to Fc receptors expressed without the fusion.
   Mechanistic insights using a novel application of in vivo ribosome
   display suggested that, although total cellular mRNA levels of L4H2-Fc
   receptor remained unchanged relative to wild-type Fc receptors, mRNA
   levels of actively translated L4H2-Fc transcript increased about
   3.8-fold relative to actively translated levels of wild-type Fc
   transcript. Similar increases in protein expression in the context of
   the other proteins tested, showing the generality of this approach for
   proteins beyond human receptors was observed. These results extended the
   number of potential schemes by which orthogonal ribosomal parts can be
   used to enhance complex protein expression in bacterial platforms.
   Within a larger scope, this study features the possibility of
   engineering 5 tags that enhance mRNA affinity to ribosomes as strategies
   to augment translation. It was envisioned that the successful
   application of profiling active ribosomes in a highly targeted manner
   could be beneficial for mechanistic translation studies concerning
   synthesis of target proteins. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying fluid flow through porous media hinges on the description of
   permeability, a property of considerable importance in many fields
   ranging from oil and gas exploration to hydrology. A common building
   block for modeling porous media permeability is consideration of fluid
   flow through tubes with circular cross section described by Poiseuille's
   law in which flow discharge is proportional to the fourth power of the
   tube's radius. In most natural porous media, pores are neither
   cylindrical nor smooth; they often have an irregular cross section and
   rough surfaces. This study presents a theoretical scaling of
   Poiseuille's approximation for flow in pores with irregular rough cross
   section quantified by a surface fractal dimension D-s2. The flow rate is
   a function of the average pore radius to the power 2(3-D-s2) instead of
   4 in the original Poiseuille's law. Values of D-s2 range from 1 to 2,
   hence, the power in the modified Poiseuille's approximation varies
   between 4 and 2, indicating that flow rate decreases as pore surface
   roughness (and surface fractal dimension D-s2) increases. We also
   proposed pore length-radius relations for isotropic and anisotropic
   fractal porous media. The new theoretical derivations are compared with
   standard approximations and with experimental values of relative
   permeability. The new approach results in substantially improved
   prediction of relative permeability of natural porous media relative to
   the original Poiseuille equation.}},

Abstract = {{Physical adsorption and mechanical entrapment are two major causes of
   polymer retention in porous media. Physical adsorption is considered an
   equilibrium process and is often modeled by assuming a Langmuir
   isotherm. The outcome is a steady state pressure response because the
   permeability reduction is also accounted for by adsorption. However,
   some experimental data show gradual increase of pressure with time,
   implying that polymer retention is a time-dependent process. We discuss
   simultaneous effect of sorption and mechanical entrapment on the polymer
   retention in porous media. An exact solution for 1-D flow problem for
   the case of constant filtration coefficient and Langmuir-sorption
   isotherm, including explicit formulae for breakthrough concentration and
   pressure drop across the core is derived. The general model with a
   varying filtration coefficient was successfully matched with
   experimental data confirming the occurrence of simultaneous sorption
   with deep-bed filtration during polymer flow in porous media. In the
   absence of mechanical entrapment, the physical adsorption causes delay
   in the polymer front and does not affect the polymer concentration
   behind the front. Addition of mechanical entrapment results in slow
   recovery of the injected concentration at the outlet (for a varying
   filtration coefficient) or reaching to a steady state concentration,
   which is only a fraction of the injected concentration (for a constant
   filtration coefficient). Accurate assessment and quantification of the
   polymer retention requires both pressure and effluent concentration data
   at the outlet of the porous medium.}},

Title = {{Compensatory strategies during manual wheelchair propulsion in response
   to weakness in individual muscle groups: A simulation study}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{34-41}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The considerable physical demand placed on the upper
   extremity during manual wheelchair propulsion is distributed among
   individual muscles. The strategy used to distribute the workload is
   likely influenced by the relative force-generating capacities of
   individual muscles, and some strategies may be associated with a higher
   injury risk than others. The objective of this study was to use forward
   dynamics simulations of manual wheelchair propulsion to identify
   compensatory strategies that can be used to overcome weakness in
   individual muscle groups and identify specific strategies that may
   increase injury risk. Identifying these strategies can provide rationale
   for the design of targeted rehabilitation programs aimed at preventing
   the development of pain and injury in manual wheelchair users.
   Methods: Muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations of manual
   wheelchair propulsion were analyzed to identify compensatory strategies
   in response to individual muscle group weakness using individual muscle
   mechanical power and stress as measures of upper extremity demand.
   Findings: The simulation analyses found the upper extremity to be robust
   to weakness in any single muscle group as the remaining groups were able
   to compensate and restore normal propulsion mechanics. The rotator cuff
   muscles experienced relatively high muscle stress levels and exhibited
   compensatory relationships with the deltoid muscles.
   Interpretation: These results underline the importance of strengthening
   the rotator cuff muscles and supporting muscles whose contributions do
   not increase the potential for impingement (i.e., the thoracohumeral
   depressors) and minimize the risk of upper extremity injury in manual
   wheelchair users. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effect of eccentricity and spatiotemporal energy on motion silencing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The now well-known motion-silencing illusion has shown that salient
   changes among a group of objects' luminances, colors, shapes, or sizes
   may appear to cease when objects move rapidly (Suchow \& Alvarez, 2011).
   It has been proposed that silencing derives from dot spacing that causes
   crowding, coherent changes in object color or size, and flicker
   frequencies combined with dot spacing (Choi, Bovik, \& Cormack, 2014;
   Peirce, 2013; Turi \& Burr, 2013). Motion silencing is a peripheral
   effect that does not occur near the point of fixation. To better
   understand the effect of eccentricity on motion silencing, we measured
   the amount of motion silencing as a function of eccentricity in human
   observers using traditional psychophysics. Fifteen observers reported
   whether dots in any of four concentric rings changed in luminance over a
   series of rotational velocities. The results in the human experiments
   showed that the threshold velocity for motion silencing almost linearly
   decreases as a function of log eccentricity. Further, we modeled the
   response of a population of simulated V1 neurons to our stimuli. We
   found strong matches between the threshold velocities on motion
   silencing observed in the human experiment and those seen in the energy
   model of Adelson and Bergen (1985). We suggest the plausible explanation
   that as eccentricity increases, the combined motion-flicker signal falls
   outside the narrow spatiotemporal frequency response regions of the
   modeled receptive fields, thereby reducing flicker visibility.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorene is a new two-dimensional material which is commonly prepared
   by exfoliation from black phosphorus bulk crystals that historically
   have been synthesized from white phosphorus under high-pressure
   conditions. The few layers of. phosphorene have a direct band gap in the
   range of 0.3-2 eV and high mobility at room temperature comparable to
   epitaxial graphene. These characteristics. can be used for the design of
   high speed digital circuits, radio frequency circuits, flexible and
   printed systems, and optoelectronic devices. In this work, we
   synthesized black phosphorus from red phosphorus, which is a safer solid
   precursor, using sonochemistry. Furthermore, via a variety of microscopy
   and spectroscopy techniques, we report characterization results of the
   sonochemically synthesized black phosphorus in addition to the
   commercial black phosphorus. Finally, we describe the air stability of
   black phosphors and the crystalline structure of the synthesized
   material. This is the first result of sonochemical or solution-based
   synthesis of black phosphorus based on readily available low-cost red
   phosphorus. This solution-based synthesis of black phosphorus is

Title = {{ControlIt! A Software Framework for Whole-Body Operational Space Control}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANOID ROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Whole Body Operational Space Control (WBOSC) enables floating-base
   highly redundant robots to achieve unified motion/force control of one
   or more operational space objectives while adhering to physical
   constraints. It is a pioneering algorithm in the field of human-centered
   Whole-Body Control (WBC). Although there are extensive studies on the
   algorithms and theory behind WBOSC, limited studies exist on the
   software architecture and APIs that enable WBOSC to perform and be
   integrated into a larger system. In this paper, we address this by
   presenting ControlIt!, a new open-source software framework for WBOSC.
   Unlike previous implementations, ControlIt! is multi-threaded to
   increase maximum servo frequencies using standard PC hardware. Anew
   parameter binding mechanism enables tight integration between ControlIt!
   and external processes via an extensible set of transport protocols. To
   support a new robot, only two plugins and a URDF model is needed - the
   rest of ControlIt! remains unchanged. New WBC primitives can be added by
   writing Task or Constraint plugins. ControlIt!'s capabilities are
   demonstrated on Dreamer, a 16-DOF torque controlled humanoid upper body
   robot containing both series elastic and co-actuated joints, and using
   it to perform a product disassembly task. Using this testbed, we show
   that ControlIt! can achieve average servo latencies of about 0.5 ms when
   con figured with two Cartesian position tasks, two orientation tasks,
   and a lower priority posture task. This is 10 times faster than the 5 ms
   that was achieved using UTA-WBC, the prototype implementation of WBOSC
   that is both application and platform-specific. Variations in the
   product's position is handled by updating the goal of the Cartesian
   position task. ControlIt!'s source code is released under LGPL and we
   hope it will be adopted and maintained by the WBC community for the long
   term as a platform for WBC development and integration.}},

Abstract = {{The past three decades have seen numerous advances in tissue engineering
   and regenerative medicine (TERM) therapies. However, despite the
   successes there is still much to be done before TERM therapies become
   commonplace in clinic. One of the main obstacles is the lack of
   knowledge regarding complex tissue engineering processes. Imaging
   strategies, in conjunction with exogenous contrast agents, can aid in
   this endeavor by assessing in vivo therapeutic progress. The ability to
   uncover real-time treatment progress will help shed light on the complex
   tissue engineering processes and lead to development of improved,
   adaptive treatments. More importantly, the utilized exogenous contrast
   agents can double as therapeutic agents. Proper use of these
   Monitoring/Imaging and Regenerative Agents (MIRAs) can help increase
   TERM therapy successes and allow for clinical translation. While other
   fields have exploited similar particles for combining diagnostics and
   therapy, MIRA research is still in its beginning stages with much of the
   current research being focused on imaging or therapeutic applications,
   separately. Advancing MIRA research will have numerous impacts on
   achieving clinical translations of TERM therapies. Therefore, it is our
   goal to highlight current MIRA progress and suggest future research that
   can lead to effective TERM treatments.}},

Title = {{Flared natural gas-based onsite atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) for
   oilfield operations}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Natural gas worth tens of billions of dollars is flared annually, which
   leads to resource waste and environmental issues. This work introduces
   and analyzes a novel concept for flared gas utilization, wherein the gas
   that would have been flared is instead used to condense atmospheric
   moisture. Natural gas, which is currently being flared, can
   alternatively power refrigeration systems to generate the cooling
   capacity for large scale atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). This
   approach solves two pressing issues faced by the oil-gas industry,
   namely gas flaring, and sourcing water for oilfield operations like
   hydraulic fracturing, drilling and water flooding. Multiple technical
   pathways to harvest atmospheric moisture by using the energy of natural
   gas are analyzed. A modeling framework is developed to quantify the
   dependence of water harvest rates on flared gas volumes and ambient
   weather. Flaring patterns in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and the
   Bakken Shale in North Dakota are analyzed to quantify the benefits of
   AWH. Overall, the gas currently flared annually in Texas and North
   Dakota can harvest enough water to meet 11\% and 65\% of the water
   consumption in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, respectively. Daily
   harvests of upto 30 000 and 18 000 gallons water can be achieved using
   the gas currently flared per well in Texas and North Dakota,
   respectively. In fifty Bakken sites, the water required for fracturing
   or drilling a new well can be met via onsite flared gas-based AWH in
   only 3 weeks, and 3 days, respectively. The benefits of this concept are
   quantified for the Eagle Ford and Bakken Shales. Assessments of the
   global potential of this concept are presented using data from countries
   with high flaring activity. It is seen that this waste-to-value
   conversion concept offers significant economic benefits while addressing
   critical environmental issues pertaining to oil-gas production.}},

Title = {{A Continuous Formulation for Logical Decisions in Differential Algebraic
   Systems using Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints}},
Journal = {{PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a methodology to represent logical decisions in
   differential algebraic equation simulation and constrained optimization
   problems using a set of continuous algebraic equations. The formulations
   may be used when state variables trigger a change in process dynamics,
   and introduces a pseudo-binary decision variable, which is continuous,
   but should only have valid solutions at values of either zero or one
   within a finite time horizon. This formulation enables dynamic
   optimization problems with logical disjunctions to be solved by
   simultaneous solution methods without using methods such as mixed
   integer programming. Several case studies are given to illustrate the
   value of this methodology including nonlinear model predictive control
   of a chemical reactor using a surge tank with overflow to buffer
   disturbances in feed flow rate. Although this work contains novel
   methodologies for solving dynamic algebraic equation (DAE) constrained
   problems where the system may experience an abrupt change in dynamics
   that may otherwise require a conditional statement, there remain
   substantial limitations to this methodology, including a limited domain
   where problems may converge and the possibility for ill-conditioning.
   Although the problems presented use only continuous algebraic equations,
   the formulation has inherent non-smoothness. Hence, these problems must
   be solved with care and only in select circumstances, such as in
   simulation or situations when the solution is expected to be near the
   solver's initial point.}},

Abstract = {{Laser speckle contrast imaging has become a ubiquitous tool for imaging
   blood flow in a variety of tissues. However, due to its widefield
   imaging nature, the measured speckle contrast is a depth integrated
   quantity and interpretation of baseline values and the depth dependent
   sensitivity of those values to changes in underlying flow has not been
   thoroughly evaluated. Using dynamic light scattering Monte Carlo
   simulations, the sensitivity of the autocorrelation function and speckle
   contrast to flow changes in the cerebral cortex was extensively
   examined. These simulations demonstrate that the sensitivity of the
   inverse autocorrelation time, 1/tau(c), varies across the field of view:
   directly over surface vessels 1/tau(c) is strongly localized to the
   single vessel, while parenchymal ROIs have a larger sensitivity to flow
   changes at depths up to 500 mu m into the tissue and up to 200 mu m
   lateral to the ROI. It is also shown that utilizing the commonly used
   models the relate 1/tau(c) to flow resulted in nearly the same
   sensitivity to the underlying flow, but fail to accurately relate
   speckle contrast values to absolute 1/tau(c). (C) 2016 Optical Society

Abstract = {{In this article, we provide the details of the predictive simulations

   The methods used are an adaptation of those used in the first SFC.
   Specifically, the material constitutive model was calibrated using
   tensile and shear test data through an inverse method. A
   strain-to-failure criterion was postulated using the loading history
   from the first point to fail in both a tension and shear test. These
   models are then embedded in a highly refined finite element simulation
   to perform a blind prediction of the failure behavior for the SFC2
   geometry. These results are compared with experiments performed by
   Sandia National Laboratories and additional experiments that were

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{A Focus on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias VT ablation is
   based on percutaneous catheter insertion under fluoroscopic guidance to
   selectively destroy (i.e., ablate) myocardial tissue regions responsible
   for the initiation or propagation of ventricular arrhythmias. Although
   the last decade has witnessed a rapid evolution of ablation equipment
   and techniques, the control over catheter movement during manual
   ablation has remained largely unchanged. Moreover, the procedures are
   long, and require ergonomically unfavorable positions, which can lead to
   operator fatigue. In an attempt to overcome these constraints, several
   technical advancements, including remote magnetic navigation (RMN), have
   been developed. RMN utilizes a magnetic field to remotely manipulate
   specially designed soft-tip ablation catheters anywhere in the x, y, or
   z plane inside the patient's chest. RMN also facilitates titration of
   the contact force between the catheter and the myocardial tissue, which
   may reduce the risk of complications while ensuring adequate lesion
   formation. There are several non-randomized studies showing that RMN has
   similar efficacy to manual ablation, while complication rates and total
   radiation exposure appears to be lower. Although these data are
   promising, larger randomized studies are needed to prove that RMN is
   superior to manual ablation of VT.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective of this study was to conduct a usability
   evaluation of mobile apps for supporting education and training in
   radiologic diagnostic decision-making processes.
   Methods: Of 381 mobile apps available at two major stores (Google Play
   and iTunes), eight iOS apps were selected for laboratory-based usability
   tests. Six staff radiologists completed eight app-specific task sets,
   using a think-aloud strategy. The triangular methods approach included
   quantitative performance measures, System Usability Scale (SUS), and
   qualitative thematic analysis using heuristic usability principles of
   usability issues.
   Results: Overall, radiologists achieved higher than 70\% success, with
   favorable SUS scores, in completing the tasks for seven of the eight
   apps. However, task success rate and SUS score had a weak relation (r =
   0.23), indicating that the perceived usability may not reflect the
   holistic usability of the app. Task analysis and self-report revealed
   108 usability issues, which were condensed to 55 unique issues and
   categorized by nine usability themes and mapped to ten usability
   heuristics. Nonintuitive functionality (eg, nonintuitive or misleading
   labels) was the most frequent theme observed, leading to inefficient
   navigation. These usability findings were consistent with the 13
   improvements the radiologists suggested.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of usability
   evaluation of radiology mobile apps and suggests potential improvements
   in the development of radiology mobile apps. This study also suggests
   that proficiency with mobile devices may not be equivalent to being an
   expert user, proficient in using the apps.}},

Abstract = {{The design of drug delivery systems capable of efficiently delivering
   poorly soluble drugs to target sites still remains a major challenge.
   Such materials require several different functionalities; typically,
   these materials should be biodegradable and nontoxic, nonimmunogenic,
   responsive to their environment, and soluble in aqueous solution while
   retaining the ability to solubilize hydrophobic drugs. Here, a
   polypeptide-polymer hybrid of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) and
   poly(2-oxazoline)s (POx) is reported. This paper describes the chemical
   synthesis, physical characteristics, and drug loading potential of these
   novel hybrid macromolecules. A novel method is introduced for terminal
   functionalization of POx with protected maleimide moieties. Following
   recovery of the maleimide group via a retro Diels-Alder reaction, the
   consecutive Michael addition of thiol-functionalized ELPs yields the
   desired protein-polymer conjugate. These conjugates form nanoparticles
   in aqueous solution capable of solubilizing the anti-cancer drug
   paclitaxel with up to 8 wt\% loading.

Title = {{Water electrolysis on La1-xSrxCoO3-delta perovskite electrocatalysts}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Perovskite oxides are attractive candidates as catalysts for the
   electrolysis of water in alkaline energy storage and conversion systems.
   However, the rational design of active catalysts has been hampered by
   the lack of understanding of the mechanism of water electrolysis on
   perovskite surfaces. Key parameters that have been overlooked include
   the role of oxygen vacancies, B-O bond covalency, and redox activity of
   lattice oxygen species. Here we present a series of cobaltite
   perovskites where the covalency of the Co-O bond and the concentration
   of oxygen vacancies are controlled through Sr2+ substitution into La1 -
   xSrxCoO3 - delta. We attempt to rationalize the high activities of La1 -
   xSrxCoO3 - delta through the electronic structure and participation of
   lattice oxygen in the mechanism of water electrolysis as revealed
   through ab initio modelling. Using this approach, we report a material,
   SrCoO2.7, with a high, room temperature-specific activity and mass
   activity towards alkaline water electrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces VEGAS, a lightweight and fast-executing fuel cycle
   simulator primarily intended to augment higher-fidelity fuel cycle
   simulators. VEGAS can act as a preconditioner as well as a platform for
   implementing endogenous decision making within these simulators. In
   preconditioner mode, VEGAS offers an iterative method for accelerating
   the convergence of fuel cycle optimization problems while ensuring that
   material balance and other constraints are met. The methodology utilized
   by VEGAS, particularly its mass balance and reactor deployment
   algorithms, is presented here. Unique to the VEGAS simulator is a
   rollback feature that undoes reactor build decisions if material balance
   constraints are violated. Included in the VEGAS code is an economics
   package, also documented here, that calculates the evolving levelized
   cost of electricity. Benchmark comparisons against the VISION
   (Verifiable Fuel Cycle Simulation Model) simulator are also presented,
   along with an example of VEGAS'S preconditioning capability in which the
   objective is to achieve a target system transuranics inventory while
   installing as little reprocessing capacity as possible.}},

Title = {{Enzyme- and pH-Responsive Microencapsulated Nanogels for Oral Delivery
   of siRNA to Induce TNF-alpha Knockdown in the Intestine}},
Journal = {{BIOMACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) manifest from excessive intestinal
   inflammation. Local delivery of siRNA that targets these inflammatory
   cytokines would provide a novel treatment approach. Micro encapsulated
   nanogels are designed and validated as platforms for oral delivery of
   siRNA targeting TNF-alpha, a common clinical target of IBD treatments.
   The preferred platform was designed to (i) protect siRNA-loaded nanogels
   from the harsh acidic environment of the upper GI tract and (ii)
   enzymatically degrade and release the nanogels once the carrier has
   reached the intestinal region. This platform consists of microgels
   composed of poly(methacrylic acid-co-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)
   (P{[}MAA-co-NVP]) cross-linked with a trypsin-degradable peptide linker.
   The P(MAA-co-NVP) backbone is designed to collapse around and protect
   encapsulated nanogel from degradation at the low pH levels seen in the
   stomach (pH 2-4). At pH levels of 6-7.5, as typically observed in the
   intestine, the P(MAA-co-NVP) matrix swells, potentially facilitating
   diffusion of intestinal fluid and degradation of the matrix by
   intestinal enzymes such as trypsin, thus ``freeing{''} the therapeutic
   nanogels for delivery and cellular uptake within the intestine.
   TNF-alpha siRNA-loaded nanogels released from this platform were capable
   of inducing potent knockdown of secreted TNF-alpha levels in murine
   macrophages, further validating the potential for this approach to be
   used for the treatment of IBD.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered nanoparticles have been proposed for use as contrast agents
   to enhance geophysical characterization of oil and gas reservoirs. Under
   saline conditions and in the presence of fine materials, nanoparticle
   mobility in porous media can be severely limited. To address this issue,
   a series of column experiments was performed to evaluate the ability of
   selected polymers and surfactants to enhance the transport of magnetite
   nanoparticles (nMag) coated with cross-linked polymers in the presence
   of American Petroleum Institute (API) brine (8 wt \% NaCl + 2 wt \%
   CaCl2). Aqueous suspensions containing nMag and API brine were injected
   at pore-water velocities of 2 +/- 0.04 m/day or 10 +/- 0.40 m/day
   through columns packed with either 40-50 mesh Ottawa sand or 60-170 mesh
   crushed Berea sandstone. When nMag (2500 mg/L) was introduced into
   Ottawa sand, 97\% of the injected mass was recovered in the column
   effluent, indicating high mobility under saline conditions. However, the
   injection of nMag (2500 mg/L) into crushed Berea sandstone resulted in
   >60\% nMag retention within the column. In order to improve delivery,
   nMag (2500 mg/L) was co-injected with 1000 mg/L hydroxyethyl cellulose
   (HEC-10), which increased nMag mobility 2-fold (78\% effluent recovery).
   Co-injection of nMag with 1000 mg/L Gum Arabic or Calfax 16L-35, an
   anionic surfactant, resulted in slightly lower effluent recoveries of
   72\% and 69\%, respectively. A preflood with 1000 mg/L HEC-10, followed
   by the injection of nMag alone (2500 mg/L), yielded an additional 20\%
   improvement in nMag mobility (93\% effluent recovery), suggesting that
   HEC-10 screened nMag attachment sites. A multisite nanoparticle
   transport model that accounts for heterogeneous mineralogy with variable
   attachment kinetics was able to accurately reproduce the effluent
   concentration data. Coupled with the observed 7-fold reduction in
   maximum retention capacity, the model parameter fits provide further
   evidence to support a site-blocking mechanism. These findings
   demonstrate the potential for relatively small additions (0.1\%) of
   commercially available polymers and surfactants to greatly improve nMag
   mobility in porous media.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer FETs generally have a wide subthreshold regime due to a lot of
   disorder, mainly originated from domain/grain boundaries. Deep state's
   charge transport of polymer transistors has not been investigated due to
   the difficulty in determining the field-effect mobility in the
   subthreshold region. In this paper, the features of the charge transport
   in deep and shallow states of polymer transistors will be discussed in
   detail through an accurate modeling and an analysis of subthreshold
   behavior in transistors. Charge transport in shallow states can be
   described by multiple trap and release transport, while hopping
   transport models, such as variable range hopping or Gaussian
   disorder-based model, describe well the deeper state's charge transport.
   In addition, the transition between the conduction regimes is a function
   of temperature and carrier density.}},

Title = {{Thickness ratio and d(33) effects on flexible piezoelectric unimorph
   energy conversion}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Piezoelectric unimorphs are bilayer structures where a blanket
   piezoelectric film (with top and bottom electrodes) is uniformly
   laminated on an inactive but flexible substrate. Because of their simple
   construction and flexibility, unimorphs are widely used as a key element
   in flexible sensors and actuators. The response of a unimorph is
   governed by the material properties of the film and the substrate as
   well as their geometric parameters. For low frequency biological energy
   harvesting, structural optimization is critical due to the dimensional
   confinement imposed by curvilinear and deformable bio-tissues. Here we
   report a comprehensive theoretical framework to investigate the effects
   of the film-to-substrate thickness ratio on voltage, charge, and energy
   outputs when the unimorph is subjected to eight different
   boundary/loading conditions. A broad class of power generators can be
   designed using such a framework under the assumption that the unimorph
   length is very large compared to its thickness, where the only
   dimensionless variable is the film-to-substrate thickness ratio. We show
   that the analytical and finite element modeling results are in excellent
   agreement. For not so thin unimorphs, there is non-zero normal stress in
   the thickness direction (sigma(3)) and d(33) can play a significant role
   in this case. Non-monotonic dependence of voltage and energy generation
   on thickness ratio has been found in some cases and optimum thickness
   ratio for unimorph generator can be predicted. When the unimorph is
   actuated by voltage applied across the piezo-film thickness,
   non-monotonic maximum deflection versus thickness ratio is also found.
   This work provides new physical insights on unimorphs and analytical
   solutions that can be used for the structural design and optimization of
   unimorphs under different boundary/loading conditions.}},

Title = {{Phase-field modeling of ferroelectric to paraelectric phase boundary
   structures in single-crystal barium titanate}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ferroelectric perovskite materials have been shown to exhibit a large
   electrocaloric effect near phase transitions. We develop a computational
   model based on a phase-field approach to characterize the structure of
   ferroelectric to paraelectric phase boundaries for planar configurations
   under generalized plane strain with temperatures near the Curie
   temperature. A nonlinear finite element method is used to solve for the
   phase boundary structure of a representative unit cell with a 180
   degrees ferroelectric laminate for a range of domain widths. The
   temperature at which the phase boundary can be found increases with
   domain width, approaching the Curie temperature asymptotically. The
   excess free energy density per unit area of the boundary increases with
   domain width. As expected, closure domains form between the
   ferroelectric and paraelectric phase, and the shape of the closure
   domains evolves from triangular to needle-shaped as the domain width
   increases. The entropy jump across the phase boundary is quantified and
   is shown to increase with domain width as well. A planar configuration
   with a 90 degrees ferroelectric laminate is investigated, but shown to
   be physically unlikely due to the high stress levels required to achieve
   strain compatibility between the phases. Possible three-dimensional
   structures of the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase boundary are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we study the ion
   diffusivities and conductivities of polyethylene oxide polymer
   electrolytes doped with LiBF4 salt and containing dispersed Al2O3
   nanoparticles. We consider nanoparticles of two different surface
   chemistries: (a) containing acid rich surface sites (alpha-Al2O3): (b)
   containing roughly equal acidic and basic surface sites (gamma-Al2O3).
   We compare the,ionic diffusivities and conductivities of such systems
   with our earlier results {[}Mogurampelly et al. Macromolecules 2015, 48,
   27732786] for systems containing basic surface sites on the
   nanoparticles (beta-Al2O3). In the presence of alpha-Al2O3 and
   gamma-Al2O3 nanoparticles, we observe a monotonic decrease of ionic
   conductivities and mobilities with particle loading. These results are
   consistent with our earlier findings in the context of beta-Al2O3
   nanoparticles. Our analysis identifies that the ionic mobilities and
   conductivities correlate with the combined effects of the changes in
   polymer segmental dynamics and the modifications in the local
   environment of ionic species arising from the introduction of
   nanoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Jilin Oilfield is conducting a large-scale demonstration project on CO2
   FOR (enhanced oil recovery) and storage in China. CO2 separated from a
   nearby natural gas reservoir (15-30 mol\% CO2) is injected into the
   northern part of H59 oil block with permeability and porosity of 3.5 mD
   and 12.7\%, respectively. After about six years of operation, nearly
   0.26 million tons of CO2 (0.32 HCPV (hydrocarbon pore volume)) has been
   injected into the thin oil layers with well-developed natural fractures.
   In order to track the movement of CO2 in the oil reservoir, a
   microseismic monitoring program has been implemented to map the CO2 flow
   anisotropy and estimate its sweeping efficiency. Gas tracer testing has
   also been conducted to examine the inter-well connectivity. The temporal
   change of produced CO2 has been analyzed in a real-time mode to monitor
   the dynamic response in production wells. It is demonstrated that the
   migration of CO2 in the thin oil layers can be successfully detected by
   the microseismic technique, and the sweeping profiles of CO2 obtained
   from the inverted microseismic are in good agreement with the produced
   CO2 rate from production wells as well as the reservoir's petrophysical
   properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents a convex-optimization-based real-time control
   allocation algorithm to optimally utilize multiple actuators on a
   momentum control system while explicitly considering actuator
   constraints. The primary objective of the allocation is to minimize
   torque error and improve performance when the system saturates or
   becomes singular. As a secondary objective, internal bearing and gear
   friction are exploited to reduce power usage without the need for
   accurate friction models. The algorithm exploits the fact that redundant
   control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) and the rotors of reaction wheel
   assemblies (RWAs) have nonsingleton minimum torque error solutions.
   Thus, friction in the rotors and gimbals of the CMG and RWA can be used
   to find a minimum power solution among the set of minimum torque error
   solutions. The convex optimization framework enables real-time
   implementable algorithms, which fully utilize control authority without
   requiring tuning for changes in the number or the configuration of
   actuators.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of the radioxenon isotopes Xe-133 and Xe-135 were
   measured as they were released from the stack at the Chalk River medical
   isotope production facility and were then measured at various sites in
   the Ottawa River Valley. Dispersion modeling was then used to model the
   local transport of these radioxenon isotopes between the production
   facility and the sampling locations. The ratio of Xe-135/Xe-133 was also
   examined using an ORIGEN-ARP model was used to understand what factors
   played a role in the Xe-135/Xe-133 ratio at the time of release by
   considering irradiation time, flux, and decay time prior to
   fractionation.}},

Abstract = {{Radioactive noble gases radioxenon and radioargon constitute the primary
   smoking gun of an underground nuclear explosion. The aim of subsurface
   sampling of soil gas as part of an on-site inspection (OSI) is to search

   hypothesized that atmospheric gas can disturb soil gas concentrations
   and therefore potentially add to problems in civilian source

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A technique capable of detecting the instantaneous, time-resolved, 3D
   flame topography is successfully demonstrated in a lean-premixed swirl
   flame undergoing flashback. A simultaneous measurement of the volumetric
   velocity field is possible without the need for additional hardware.
   Droplets which vaporize in the preheat zone of the flame serve as the
   marker for the flame front. The droplets are illuminated with a laser
   and imaged from four different views followed by a tomographic
   reconstruction to obtain the volumetric particle field. Void regions in
   the reconstructed particle field, which correspond to regions of burnt
   gas, are detected with a series of image processing steps. The interface
   separating the void region from regions filled with particles is defined
   as the flame surface. The velocity field in the unburnt gas is measured
   using tomographic PIV. The resulting data include the simultaneous 3D
   flame front and 3D volumetric velocity field at 5 kHz. The technique is
   applied to a lean-premixed (phi = 0.8), swirling methane-air flame and
   validated against simultaneously acquired planar measurements. The mean
   error associated with the reconstructed 3D flame topography is about 0.4
   mm, which is smaller than the flame thickness under the studied
   conditions. The mean error associated with the volumetric velocity field
   is about 0.2 m s(-1).}},
