Abstract = {{Phase-field models based on the variational formulation for brittle
   fracture have recently been gaining popularity. These models have proven
   capable of accurately and robustly predicting complex crack behavior in
   both two and three dimensions. In this work we propose a fourth-order
   model for the phase-field approximation of the variational formulation
   for brittle fracture. We derive the thermodynamically consistent
   governing equations for the fourth-order phase-field model by way of a
   variational principle based on energy balance assumptions. The resulting
   model leads to higher regularity in the exact phase-field solution,
   which can be exploited by the smooth spline function spaces utilized in
   isogeometric analysis. This increased regularity improves the
   convergence rate of the numerical solution and opens the door to
   higher-order convergence rates for fracture problems. We present an
   analysis of our proposed theory and numerical examples that support this
   claim. We also demonstrate the robustness of the model in capturing
   complex three-dimensional crack behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Modeling the Time-Varying Subjective Quality of HTTP Video Streams With

Abstract = {{Newly developed hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)-based video streaming
   technologies enable flexible rate-adaptation under varying channel
   conditions. Accurately predicting the users' quality of experience (QoE)
   for rate-adaptive HTTP video streams is thus critical to achieve
   efficiency. An important aspect of understanding and modeling QoE is
   predicting the up-to-the-moment subjective quality of a video as it is
   played, which is difficult due to hysteresis effects and non-linearities
   in human behavioral responses. This paper presents a Hammerstein-Wiener
   model for predicting the time-varying subjective quality (TVSQ) of
   rate-adaptive videos. To collect data for model parameterization and
   validation, a database of longer duration videos with time-varying
   distortions was built and the TVSQs of the videos were measured in a
   large-scale subjective study. The proposed method is able to reliably
   predict the TVSQ of rate adaptive videos. Since the Hammerstein-Wiener
   model has a very simple structure, the proposed method is suitable for
   online TVSQ prediction in HTTP-based streaming.}},

Title = {{An Experimental Investigation of the Effectiveness of Empathic
   Experience Design for Innovative Concept Generation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An important part of designing successful products is building empathy
   for the people for whom the product is intended. Despite recent interest
   in empathic design techniques, they remain confined primarily to
   customer needs analysis and design problem definition activities, and
   much of the evidence for their impact on engineering designs is
   anecdotal. In this paper, empathic design techniques are formally
   integrated into the conceptual design process, and their effectiveness
   is investigated with a controlled idea generation experiment. Empathic
   experience design (EED) is a structured conceptual design method focused
   on stimulating creative, user-centered concept generation by engaging
   designers in empathic experiences as part of concept generation.
   Empathic experiences are demanding product interaction tasks that are
   intended to help a design engineer empathize with customers who use a
   product under a variety of sometimes challenging conditions. Empathic
   experiences can represent either actual disabilities or situational
   disabilities, which are experienced by lead users who push a product to
   its extremes and experience needs prior to the general population. In
   some cases, these empathic experiences amplify the situational
   disability as a means of highlighting the challenges of interacting with
   a particular product or system. A representative example is the use of
   thick gloves to limit a designer's dexterity and thereby highlight the
   challenges associated with either actual disabilities, such as
   arthritis, or situational disabilities, such as extreme cold or fatigue
   that make it difficult to move one's fingers freely. The EED method
   precedes concept generation activities with a series of these empathic
   experiences involving a baseline product to be redesigned. Many
   professional designers incorporate empathy and empathic experiences into
   their design practices, but evidence of their impact on resulting
   designs has been largely anecdotal. In this paper, their effectiveness
   is investigated formally with strategically designed experiments. The
   research hypothesis is that empathic experiences, when coupled with
   concept generation activities, lead to designs that are more original,
   especially with respect to features that enhance product-user
   interactions. To test this hypothesis, experiments were conducted on two
   example problems in which participants were asked to develop concepts
   for a next-generation product. Experimental groups completed a
   controlled concept generation task after engaging in empathic
   experiences with a prototype product to be redesigned. Control groups
   completed an identical concept generation task after interacting with
   the prototype products freely. Resulting concepts were analyzed for
   their originality, technical feasibility, and embodiment of a specific
   set of innovation characteristics. Results indicate that the
   experimental participants who were exposed to empathic experiences prior
   to concept generation produced concepts with significantly higher rates
   of original product-user interaction features without any sacrifice in
   technical feasibility. The overall originality of the concepts is also
   higher for redesign problems with an abundance of existing solutions,
   indicating that the EED method also helps alleviate design fixation.}},

Abstract = {{The bicuspid aortic valve (AV) is the most common cardiac congenital
   anomaly and has been found to be a significant risk factor for
   developing calcific AV disease. However, the mechanisms of disease
   development remain unclear. In this study we quantified the structure of
   human normal and bicuspid leaflets in the early disease stage. From
   these individual leaflet maps average fiber structure maps were
   generated using a novel spline based technique. Interestingly, we found
   statistically different and consistent regional structures between the
   normal and bicuspid valves. The regularity in the observed
   microstructure was a surprising finding, especially for the pathological
   BAV leaflets and is an essential cornerstone of any predictive
   mathematical models of valve disease. In contrast, we determined that
   isolated valve interstitial cells from BAV leaflets show the same in
   vitro calcification pathways as those from the normal AV leaflets. This
   result suggests the VICs are not intrinsically different when isolated,
   and that external features, such as abnormal microstructure and altered
   flow may be the primary contributors in the accelerated calcification
   experienced by BAV patients.}},

Pages = {{1847-1858}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on stretch-induced wrinkling of thin
   polyethylene sheets when subjected to uniaxial stretch with two clamped
   ends. Three-dimensional digital image correlation was used to measure
   the wrinkling deformation. It was observed that the wrinkle amplitude
   increased as the nominal strain increased up to around 10\%, but then
   decreased at larger strain levels. This behavior is consistent with
   results of finite element simulations for a hyperelastic thin sheet
   reported previously (Nayyar et al., 2011). However, wrinkles in the
   polyethylene sheet were not fully flattened out at large strains (>30\%)
   as predicted for the hyperelastic sheet, but exhibited a residual
   wrinkle whose amplitude depended on the loading rate. This is attributed
   to the viscoelastic response of the material. Two different viscoelastic
   models were adopted in finite element simulations to study the effects
   of viscoelasticity on wrinkling and to improve the agreement with the
   experiments, including residual wrinkles and rate dependence. It is
   found that a parallel network model of nonlinear viscoelasticity is
   suitable for simulating the constitutive behavior and stretch-induced
   wrinkling of the polyethylene sheets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) is an industrial metallurgical process widely
   used throughout the specialty metals industry to cast large alloy
   ingots. The final ingot grain structure is strongly influenced by the
   molten metal pool profile, which in turn depends on the temperature
   distribution in the ingot. A reduced-order model of the solidifying
   ingot was developed specifically for dynamic control and estimation of
   the depth of molten liquid pool atop the ingot in a VAR process. This
   model accounts only for the thermal aspects of the system ignoring other
   physical domains such as fluid flow and electromagnetic effects.
   Spectral methods were used to obtain a set of nonlinear dynamic
   equations which capture the transient characteristics of liquid pool
   profile variations around a quasi-steady operating condition. These
   nonlinear equations are then linearized and further simplified by
   suppressing fast modes. The resulting system was used to construct a
   linear-quadratic-gaussian (LQG) controller which was tested in a
   laboratory-scale furnace showing a good performance. A high-fidelity
   physics-based model is used in real-time to provide information about
   the solidifying ingot and potential solidification defects.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the release of heat
   from a thermal storage unit, which we refer to as a hot thermal battery.
   The battery is composed of a hexagonal arrangement of parallel tubes
   through which a heat absorbing fluid flows, surrounded by phase change
   material (PCM) that fills spaces between adjacent tubes. The simulations
   implemented, aimed to optimize the battery such that it meets a total
   volume constraint while ensuring a critical power output before the
   phase change fronts of the PCM surrounding two adjacent heat transfer
   tubes merge-indicating the PCM is completely solidified-after which,
   only sensible heat can be released by the battery. It was found that the
   PCM latent heat has negligible impact on the optimal heat exchanger
   (HEx) design. In comparison, increasing either the flow velocity of the
   heat transfer fluid in the tubes or PCM thermal conductivity can
   significantly reduce the needed volume of heat exchanger. Additionally,
   a novel closed loop control modeling approach is proposed to dynamically
   tune the heat transfer fluid flow rate such that the thermal battery
   yields a constant power output. The flow tuning results indicate the
   optimal dynamic HTF velocity curve shape, obtained from closed-loop
   method, is unique and this optimal flow velocity is dependent on the
   location of the phase change front. Numerical results were also compared
   against hot battery discharge experiments, using both constant and
   dynamically tuned flow rates, indicating a good agreement for both
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{Managers, typically, are unaware of the significant impact their
   decisions could have on the random mechanism driving a data generating
   process. Here, a new parametric Bayesian technique is introduced that
   would allow managers to obtain an estimate of the impact of their
   decisions on the stochastic process driving the data; this, in turn,
   should enhance a company's overall decision-making capabilities. This
   general approach to modeling decision-dependency is carried out via an
   efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo method. A simulated example, and a
   real-life example, using historical maintenance and failure time data
   from a system at the South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company,
   exemplifies the paper's theoretical contributions. Conclusive evidence
   of decision dependence in the failure time distribution is reported,
   which in turn points to an optimal maintenance policy that results in
   potentially large financial savings to the Texas-based company. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Partial oxidation of alcohols is a topic of great interest in the field
   of gold catalysis. In this work, we provide evidence that the partial
   oxidation of allyl alcohol to its corresponding aldehyde, acrolein, over
   oxygen-precovered gold surfaces occurs via multiple reaction pathways.
   Utilizing temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) with isotopically
   labeled water and oxygen species, reactive molecular beam scattering,
   and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that
   the reaction mechanism for allyl alcohol oxidation is influenced by the
   relative proportions of atomic oxygen and hydroxyl species on the gold
   surface. Both atomic oxygen and hydroxyl species are shown to be active
   for allyl alcohol oxidation, but each displays a different pathway of
   oxidation, as indicated by TPD measurements and DFT calculations. The
   hydroxyl hydrogen of allyl alcohol is readily abstracted by either
   oxygen adatoms or adsorbed hydroxyl species on the gold surface to
   generate a surface-bound allyloxide intermediate, which then undergoes
   alpha-dehydrogenation via interaction with an oxygen adatom or surface
   hydroxyl species to generate acrolein. Mediation of a second allyloxide
   with the hydroxyl species lowers the activation barrier for the
   alpha-dehydrogenation process. A third pathway exists in which two
   hydroxyl species recombine to generate water and an oxygen adatom, which
   subsequently dehydrogenates allyloxide. This work may aid in the
   understanding of oxidative catalysis over gold and the effect of water
   therein.}},

Abstract = {{We study the influence of block copolymer (BCP) compatibilizers on the
   domain and interfacial characteristics of the equilibrium morphological
   structures of semiflexible polymer/solvent blends. Our study is
   motivated by the question of whether block copolymer compatibilizers can
   be used to influence the phase separation morphologies resulting in
   conjugated polymer/fullerene blends. Toward this objective, we use a
   single chain in mean field Monte Carlo simulations for the phase
   behavior of semiflexible polymer/solvent blends and study the influence
   of BCP compatibilizers on the morphologies. Our results reveal a range
   of blend compositions and molecular chemistries that result in
   equilibrium structures with domain sizes on the order of 5-20 nm. To
   elucidate the morphological characteristics of these structures, we
   first present a series of ternary phase diagrams and then present
   results demonstrating that the blend composition, semiflexible chain
   rigidity, BCP composition, and component miscibility each provide unique
   handles to control the phase separation morphologies and interfacial
   characteristics in such blends.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of the atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor
   bis(N-tert-butyl-N'-ethylpropionamidinato) cobalt(II) (CoAMD) on SiO2,
   carbon-doped oxide (CDO), and Cu is reported. Adsorption was performed
   under ALD cycling conditions with and without H-2 coreactant to mimic
   the first and second ALD half reactions on the substrates. Resultant
   surface chemistries were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   Adsorption of CoAMD proved self-limiting and the precursor reduced
   readily on Cu with and without H-2 coreactant to form Co-0. Residual C
   and N signals on Cu suggest that amidinate ligands and decomposition
   fragments from CoAMD adsorb on the Cu surface. On SiO2 and CDO, CoAMD
   chemisorbs on O containing moieties, primarily OH, to form Co2+.
   Accumulation of Co after three ALD cycles was greatest on Cu and least
   on CDO.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we have fabricated nanometer-scale channel length
   quantum-well (QW) metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors
   (MOSFETs) incorporating beryllium oxide (BeO) as an interfacial layer.
   BeO has high thermal stability, excellent electrical insulating
   characteristics, and a large band-gap, which make it an attractive
   candidate for use as a gate dielectric in making MOSFETs. BeO can also
   act as a good diffusion barrier to oxygen owing to its small atomic
   bonding length. In this work, we have fabricated In0.53Ga0.47As MOS
   capacitors with BeO and Al2O3 and compared their electrical
   characteristics. As interface passivation layer, BeO/HfO2 bilayer gate
   stack presented effective oxide thickness less 1 nm. Furthermore, we
   have demonstrated In0.7Ga0.3As QW MOSFETs with a BeO/HfO2 dielectric,
   showing a sub-threshold slope of 100 mV/dec, and a transconductance
   (g(m, max)) of 1.1 mS/mu m, while displaying low values of gate leakage
   current. These results highlight the potential of atomic layer deposited
   BeO for use as a gate dielectric or interface passivation layer for
   III-V MOSFETs at the 7 nm technology node and/or beyond. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Phthalate emission from vinyl floorings was measured in specially
   designed stainless steel chambers. Phthalate concentrations increased
   and reached steady state after 2 to 5 days for all experiments. By
   having a high ratio of emission surface to sorption surface, avoiding
   mass loss of phthalates onto sampling pathways, and improving air mixing
   inside the chamber, the time to reach steady state was significantly
   reduced, compared to previous studies (I to 5 months). An innovative
   approach was developed to determine y(0), the gas-phase concentration of
   phthalates in equilibrium with the material phase, which is the key
   parameter controlling phthalate emissions. Target phthalate
   material-phase concentration (C-0) and vapor pressure (V-p) were
   explicitly measured and found to have great influences on the yo value.
   For low phthalate concentrations in materials, a simple partitioning
   mechanism may linearly relate y(0) and C-0, but cannot be evoked for
   high-weight phthalate percentages. In addition, the sorption kinetics
   and adsorption isotherm of phthalates on stainless steel chamber
   surfaces were determined experimentally. Independently measured or
   calculated parameters were used to validate a semivolatile organic
   compounds (SVOCs) emission model, with excellent agreement between model
   predictions and the observed chamber concentrations in gas and stainless
   steel phases. With the knowledge of y(0) and emission mechanisms, human
   exposure to phthalates from tested floorings was assessed; the levels
   were comparable to previous studies. This work developed a rapid, novel
   method to measure phthalate emissions; emission measurement results can
   be connected to exposure assessment and help health professionals
   estimate screening-level exposures associated with SVOCs and conduct
   risk-based prioritization for SVOC chemicals of concern.}},

Abstract = {{Use of reclaimed water-municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent-in
   nonpotable applications can be a sustainable and efficient water
   management strategy. One such nonpotable application is at
   thermoelectric power plants since these facilities require cooling,
   often using large volumes of freshwater. To evaluate the geographic,
   technologic, and economic feasibility of using reclaimed water to cool
   thermoelectric power plants, we developed a spatially resolved model of
   existing power plants. Our model integrates data on power plant and
   municipal wastewater treatment plant operations into a combined
   geographic information systems and optimization approach to evaluate the
   feasibility of cooling system retrofits. We applied this broadly
   applicable methodology to 125 power plants in Texas as a test case.
   Results show that sufficient reclaimed water resources exist within 25
   miles of 92 power plants (representing 61\% of capacity and 50\% of
   generation in our sample), with most of these facilities meeting both
   short-term and long-term water conservation cost goals. This retrofit
   analysis indicates that reclaimed water could be a suitable cooling
   water source for thermoelectric power plants, thereby mitigating some of
   the freshwater impacts of electricity generation.}},

Abstract = {{We study the spectral approximation properties of finite element and
   NURBS spaces from a global perspective. We focus on eigenfunction
   approximations and discover that the L-2-norm errors for finite element
   eigenfunctions exhibit pronounced ``spikes{''} about the transition
   points between branches of the eigenvalue spectrum. This pathology is
   absent in NURBS approximations. By way of the Pythagorean eigenvalue
   error theorem, we determine that the squares of the energy-norm errors
   of the eigenfunctions are the sums of the eigenvalue errors and the
   squares of the L-2-norm eigenfunction errors. The spurious behavior of
   the higher eigenvalues for standard finite elements is well-known and
   therefore inherited by the energy-norm errors along with the spikes in
   the L-2-norm of the eigenfunction errors. The eigenvalue pathology is
   absent for NURBS. The implications of these results to the corresponding
   elliptic boundary-value problem and parabolic and hyperbolic
   initial-value problems are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A mechanism-dependent material model for the effects of grain growth and
   anisotropy on plastic deformation of magnesium alloy AZ31 sheet at 450
   degrees C}},

Abstract = {{Utilization of wrought magnesium sheet alloys for structural components
   in transportation industries has been severely limited by poor
   room-temperature formability, a result of the slip behaviors inherent to
   Mg's hexagonal close-packed crystal structure. Today, the only
   production technology to clearly overcome this limitation uses hot
   forming to activate additional (non-basal) slip systems in Mg alloy
   sheet. The absence of an accurate material constitutive model that
   captures the complex mechanical response of Mg sheet alloys at elevated
   temperatures has been a persistent barrier to accurate forming
   simulations. This study addresses that issue using experimental
   measurements and mechanism-based modeling. The mechanisms of plastic
   deformation in a Mg AZ31 wrought alloy sheet at 450 degrees C across
   strain rates from 10(-4) to 10(-1) s(-1) are identified as
   grain-boundary-sliding (GBS) creep and five-power dislocation-climb (DC)
   creep. GBS creep is subject to hardening from grain growth, and DC creep
   produces texture-dependent plastic anisotropy. Based on these
   mechanisms, a new material constitutive model for Mg AZ31 at 450 degrees
   C is constructed to predict plastic response under general multiaxial
   loading. A unique aspect of this new model is that it accounts for
   hardening and plastic anisotropy by linking these effects to the two
   mechanisms controlling deformation. The model is validated against
   independent experimental data and provides accurate predictions for hot
   forming of a simple test shape. The new material model is the first for
   Mg AZ31 sheet that accurately predicts deformation at an elevated
   temperature under both uniaxial and biaxial stress states. (C) 2014 Acta

Title = {{Where does solar-aided seawater desalination make sense? A method for
   identifying sustainable sites}},

Volume = {{339}},

Abstract = {{Global water planners are increasingly considering seawater desalination
   as an alternative to traditional freshwater supplies. Since desalination
   is both expensive and energy intensive, taking advantage of favorable
   natural and societal conditions while siting desalination facilities can
   provide significant financial and environmental returns. Currently,
   policy makers do not use a location-specific integrated analytical
   framework to determine where natural and societal conditions are
   conducive to desalination. This analysis seeks to fill that gap by
   demonstrating a multi-criteria, geographically-resolved methodology for
   identifying suitable regions for desalination infrastructure where 1)
   available renewable resources can offset part of the fossil energy load;
   2) feedwater characteristics reduce the total energy needed for
   desalination; and 3) human populations have capacity and willingness to
   pay for desalinated water. This work demonstrates the method with a
   quantitative global analysis that identifies favorable sites for
   solar-aided seawater reverse osmosis desalination (SWRO) based on
   specific target criteria. Location-based data about natural conditions
   (solar insolation, ocean salinity, and ocean temperature) are integrated
   and mapped with social indicators (water stress, prevailing water
   prices, and population) to identify regions where solar-aided SWRO has
   the highest potential. This work concludes that water-stressed tropical
   and subtropical cities show the highest potential for economically
   sustainable solar-aided SWRO. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Cognitive analysis techniques to document field personnel's knowledge
   have been a recent topic of interest in construction. However, the
   decision to utilize such techniques remains a difficult one, given their
   perceived complexity, their variety of scopes and means and their
   expected limitations for utilization in jobsites. This paper presents a
   critical review of cognitive analysis techniques to analyze their value
   for construction management research. The evaluation is geared towards
   identifying the function of different types of techniques as well as
   constraints for their implementation in construction environments. In
   the evaluation, the components of techniques are dissected to uncover
   their individual capabilities and applications, while also providing
   insight into the actual difficulties to collect and represent knowledge.
   This analysis is complemented by the authors' experience in previous
   cognitive analysis studies, which helps produce a set of recommendations
   about the practical challenges and implications of deploying specific
   techniques in construction jobsites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We propose an ultra-thin elastic cloak to control the scattering of
   bending waves in isotropic heterogeneous thin plates. The cloak design
   makes use of the scattering cancellation technique applied, for the
   first time, to the biharmonic operator describing the propagation of
   bending waves in thin plates. We first analyze scattering from hard and
   soft cylindrical objects in the quasistatic limit, then we prove that
   the scattering of bending waves from an object in the near and far-field
   regions can be suppressed significantly by covering it with a suitably
   designed coating. Beyond camouflaging, these findings may have potential
   applications in protection of buildings from earthquakes and isolating
   structures from vibrations in the motor vehicle industry.}},

Abstract = {{The disposal of acid gas (CO2/H2S mixtures) is a critical aspect in the
   production of hydrocarbons from sour gas fields. The increasing emphasis
   on CO2 sequestration has also renewed interest in the disposal of flue
   gas mixtures (primarily containing CO2 and H2S). A common strategy for
   safe disposal, in either case, is to inject the acid gas in aquifers
   close to production plants. These strategies rely on solubility
   calculations at different pressures and temperatures, governed by the
   field operating conditions. We present a comprehensive approach using
   Gibbs free energy minimization to calculate acid gas solubility in water
   at high temperatures (298-393 K) and pressures (0.1-80 MPa). The
   advantage of this approach is the flexibility to use different
   thermodynamic models for different phases. The proposed model uses the
   Peng-Robinson (PR) Equation of State (EOS) description for gas
   components while the liquid components are described using the ideal
   assumption for the temperature range 298-323 K and the Nonrandom
   Two-Liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model at temperatures greater
   than 323 K. The model predictions compare well with experimental data
   for binary (CO2-H2O and H2S-H2O) and ternary mixtures (CO2-H2S-H2O). The
   model can also be easily extended to predict the solubility of any gas
   in water as well as brine containing ions to incorporate geochemical
   reactions.}},

   designed antenna is fabricated and its circular polarisation performance
   is verified in the far field. The power transfer efficiency is then
   examined in the near field via simulation and measurement. It is shown
   that the designed circularly polarised antenna is effective in
   mitigating orientation dependence down to a distance of 0.2 lambda.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on layered perovskites has established the group theoretical
   guidelines under which a combination of octahedral distortions and
   cation ordering can break inversion symmetry, leading to polar
   structures. The microscopic mechanism of this form of
   ferroelectricity-so-called hybrid-improper ferroelectricity-has been
   elucidated in two families of layered perovskites: AA'B2O6 double
   perovskites and Ruddlesden-Popper phases. In this work, we use symmetry
   principles, crystal chemical models, and first-principles calculations
   to unravel the crystal chemical origin of ferroelectricity in the Dion
   Jacobson phases, and show that the hybrid improper mechanism can provide
   a unifying explanation for the emergence of polar structures in this
   family of materials. We link trends in the magnitude of the induced
   polarizations to changes in structure and composition and discuss
   possible phase-transition scenarios. Our results suggest that the
   structures of several Dion Jacobson phases that have previously been
   characterized as centrosymmetric should be re-examined. Our work adds
   new richness to theories of how polar structures emerge in layered

Abstract = {{Background: The endothelial glycocalyx extends into the arterial lumen
   and experiences shear forces from blood flow. Results: The loss of
   syndecan-1 results in a pro-inflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells
   with an altered response to atheroprotective flow. Conclusion:
   Syndecan-1 plays an important role in maintaining healthy endothelial
   phenotype. Significance: Therapies that retain syndecan-1 on endothelial
   cells may have the potential to reduce the progression of vascular
   disease.
   Fluid shear stresses are potent regulators of vascular homeostasis and
   powerful determinants of vascular disease progression. The glycocalyx is
   a layer of glycoaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins that
   lines the luminal surface of arteries. The glycocalyx interacts directly
   with hemodynamic forces from blood flow and, consequently, is a prime
   candidate for the mechanosensing of fluidic shear stresses. Here, we
   investigated the role of the glycocalyx component syndecan-1 (sdc-1) in
   controlling the shear stress-induced signaling and flow-mediated
   phenotypic modulation in endothelial cells. We found that knock-out of
   sdc-1 abolished several key early signaling events of endothelial cells
   in response to shear stress including the phosphorylation of Akt, the
   formation of a spatial gradient in paxillin phosphorylation, and the
   activation of RhoA. After exposure to atheroprotective flow, we found
   that sdc-1 knock-out endothelial cells had a phenotypic shift to an
   inflammatory/pro-atherosclerotic phenotype in contrast to the
   atheroprotective phenotype of wild type cells. Consistent with these
   findings, we found increased leukocyte adhesion to sdc-1 knock-out
   endothelial cells in vitro that was reduced by re-expression of sdc-1.
   In vivo, we found increased leukocyte recruitment and vascular
   permeability/inflammation in sdc-1 knock-out mice. Taken together, our
   studies support a key role for sdc-1 in endothelial mechanosensing and
   regulation of endothelial phenotype.}},

   spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry depth
   profiling reveal that a finite amount of Cu continuously segregates to

Abstract = {{Catalytic plate microchannel reactors (CPRs) are one of the most
   successful implementations of the process intensification philosophy,
   and have been recognized as an important contributor in the path toward
   monetizing distributed natural gas resources through localized,
   small-scale processing. While their reduced geometric dimensions lead to
   well-documented energy efficiency gains and lower capital costs, they
   also give rise to specific control and operation challenges,
   particularly in terms of preventing temperature excursions and the
   formation of hotspots that can compromise the integrity of the reactor.
   In conventional reactors, such issues are typically addressed through
   external cooling and by judiciously distributing the feed streams along
   the reactor to modulate the release of reaction heat. Owing to the
   difficulty of implementing distributed sensors and actuators at a small
   scale, this solution is not readily applicable to the design and
   operation of microchannel reactors. As a consequence, in this paper, we
   propose a novel approach to modulation of heat generation in
   microchannel reactors, via a segmented catalyst macromorphology
   consisting of alternating catalytically active and inactive
   ({''}blank{''}) reactor sections. We also introduce a novel
   optimization-based strategy for determining the number, length, and
   axial location of the active sections based on closely tracking a
   desirable, optimized temperature profile. Using the detailed model of an
   autothermal methane-steam reforming reactor, we demonstrate the efficacy
   of the optimized segmented macromorphology in ensuring a uniform axial
   temperature profile. Further, we demonstrate through simulations that,
   at the optimum, the temperature and conversion profiles resulting from
   the proposed segmented macromorphology are similar to those obtained in
   a microchannel reactor with multiple axially distributed reactant feed
   points.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated virtual metrology (VM) and quality
   excursion detection framework for online implementation on a plasma etch
   tool. Traditional external metrology have inherent delays and are
   sparingly performed only on the most critical steps of manufacturing. To
   reduce metrology delay and limit the impact of quality excursion wafers,
   VM models can be used predict relevant quality outputs using process
   variables such as chamber pressure, gas flow rate, power level, and
   other plasma measurements. Although existing VM methods work well using
   off-line data sets, they face online implementation challenges, such as
   outliers and process drifts that degrade model accuracy. To develop an
   efficient and reliable framework for online VM monitoring, we combine
   data pretreatment using total partial least-squares projection, model
   updating with moving window PLS, and model feature selection using PLS
   variable importance in projections core filtering. The combined model
   can be implemented with low memory footprint and is also shown to be
   robust against drifts and disturbances. Modeling results from industrial
   data sets are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{High-mix manufacturing in the semiconductor industry has driven the
   development of several nonthreaded state estimation methods. These
   methods share information among different manufacturing contexts and
   avoid data segregation that threaded methods require. However, existing
   nonthreaded methods consider either white noise disturbance or
   integrated white noise disturbance. In this work, we derive the
   state-space representation of the nonthreaded state estimation problem.
   The derivation considers an integrated moving average (IMA) disturbance,
   which is more realistic than white noise or integrated white noise
   disturbance for most semiconductor processes. In addition, the
   derivation considers the fact that if a context item is not involved in
   a process run, then its state does not change. Finally, we propose an
   improved nonthreaded state estimation method based on the Kalman filter.
   Simulations examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the
   proposed method, which is also compared with the existing Kalman filter
   approach, which considers integrated white noise only. A practical
   modification of the improved Kalman filter is also proposed to
   significantly simplify the implementation while providing comparable
   state estimation performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a model-based detection and isolation (FDI) system

   the FDI objectives. A better understanding of the residual trends,
   calculated from the difference between measurements and the EKF
   estimates, can be obtained when a fault occurs by developing a model
   that is able to predict the behavior of the residuals. This model is
   utilized as the basis for detection and isolation of single and multiple
   faults. Comparisons with data driven techniques, specifically principal
   component analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA, show superior isolation
   results, having the advantage of distinguishing single and multiple
   faults from a diverse array of possible faults, a common occurrence in

Abstract = {{Retail stores contain a wide range of products that can emit a variety
   of indoor pollutants. Among these chemicals, phthalate esters and
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are two important categories,
   because they are extensively used as additives in consumer products and
   associated with serious health concerns. This study measured six
   phthalate and 14 PBDE compounds inside of 12 retail stores in Texas and
   Pennsylvania, U.S. Phthalates and PBDEs were widely found in the retail
   environment, indicating that they are ubiquitous indoor air pollutants.
   DEP. DnBP, and DEHP were the most abundant phthalates, with DnBP showing
   the highest concentration (0.23 +/- 0.36 mu g m(-3)). PBDEs were
   dominated by BDE-28, -99, and -209, having concentrations as high as
   0.85 +/- 1.99 ng m(-3) (BDE-99). The levels of phthalates and PBDEs
   measured in this study are comparable to concentrations found in
   previous investigations of residential buildings, with phthalates
   showing lower concentrations and PBDEs exhibiting higher concentrations
   in retail stores. The potential co-occurrence of phthalates was not as
   strong as that of PBDEs, suggesting that phthalates might have more
   diverse sources. Whole building emission rates were calculated and
   showed similar patterns of variations as indoor air concentrations,
   suggestion the diversity of indoor sources of phthalates and PBDEs in
   retail environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor phthalate levels were investigated in 28 buildings, including 14
   office and 14 residential buildings in Xi'an, China. Phthalate esters in
   the gas-, particle-, and dust- phase were measured separately. Four
   phthalates including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diisobutyl phthalate
   (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
   (DEHP) were detected. The detection frequency of DnBP and DEHP was more
   than 90\%. The concentrations of total phthalate esters ranged from 0.20
   to 8.29 mu g m(-3) for the gas-phase, from 0.09 to 14.77 mu g m(-3) for
   the particle- phase and from 123 to 9504 mu g g(-1) for the dust- phase.
   The individual phthalate with the highest concentrations of 6.17 mu g
   m(-3), 7.97 mu g m(-3) and 7228 mu g g(-1) respectively for gas-,

   median concentration of the gas- and particle-phase DiBP (0.52 and 0.72

   was also found that the average concentrations of individual phthalates

   correlation analysis indicated that DiBP, DnBP and DEHP might come from
   the same sources. Based on the gas- and particle-phase concentrations
   measured, the particle-air partition coefficients of phthalates were
   estimated, and their logarithm values were found to be linearly
   correlated with the logarithm values of their octanol-air partition
   coefficients. Finally, the total daily exposure to indoor phthalates in

Title = {{Estimating CO2 Fluxes Along Leaky Wellbores}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is likely to
   bring CO2 plumes into contact with a large number of existing wellbores.
   The flux of CO2 along a leaking wellbore requires a model of fluid
   properties and of transport along the leakage pathway. Knowing the range
   of effective permeability of faulty cement is essential for estimating
   the risk of CO2 leakage. The central premise of this paper is that the
   leakage pathway in wells that exhibit sustained casing pressure (SCP) is
   analogous to the rate-limiting part of the leakage pathway in any
   wellbore that CO2 might encounter. Thus, field observations of SCP can
   be used to estimate transport properties of a CO2-leakage pathway.
   Uncertainty in the estimate can be reduced by accounting for constraints
   from well-construction geometry and from physical considerations. We
   then describe a simple CO2-leakage model. The model accounts for
   variation in CO2 properties along the leakage path and allows the path
   to terminate in an unconfined (constant-pressure) exit. The latter
   assumption provides a worst-case leakage flux.
   By use of pathway permeabilities consistent with observations in SCP
   wells, we obtain a range of CO2 fluxes for the cases of buoyancy-driven
   (post-injection) and pressure-driven (during injection) leakage.
   Assuming the frequency distribution is representative of SCP wells, we
   observe that in leakage pathways corresponding to the slow but
   nonnegligible buildup of casing pressure (several psi/D), the effective
   permeability of the leakage path is in the range of microdarcies to
   hundreds of microdarcies, and the corresponding CO2 fluxes are
   comparable with naturally occurring background fluxes observed at the
   ground surface. In pathways corresponding to intermediate and fast
   buildup rate of casing pressure (tens to hundreds of psi/D), the
   effective permeability is in the range of tenths to tens of
   millidarcies, and the CO2 fluxes are comparable with surface flux
   measurements at the Illinois basin and at the natural seep at Crystal
   Geyser (Utah). In pathways corresponding to very fast buildup rate
   (thousands of psi/D), the effective permeability is from tens to
   hundreds of millidarcies and the CO2 fluxes are up to three orders of
   magnitude higher than those measured at Crystal Geyser.}},

Abstract = {{The current approach to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from
   pulverized-coal-fired power plants is not economically viable without
   either large subsidies or a very high price on carbon. Current schemes
   require roughly one-third of a power-plant's energy for carbon dioxide
   (CO2) capture and pressurization. The production of energy from
   geopressured aquifers has evolved as a separate, independent technology
   from the sequestration of CO2 in deep, saline aquifers. A game-changing
   new idea is described here that combines the two technologies and adds
   another-the dissolution of CO2 into extracted brine that is then
   reinjected. A systematic investigation covering a range of conditions
   was performed to explore the best strategy for the coupled process of
   CO2 sequestration and energy production. Geological models of
   geopressured/geothermal aquifers were developed with available data from
   studies of Gulf Coast aquifers. These geological models were used to
   perform compositional reservoir simulations of realistic processes with
   coupled aquifer and wellbore models.}},

Title = {{Switchable Nonionic to Cationic Ethoxylated Amine Surfactants for CO2
   Enhanced Oil Recovery in High-Temperature, High-Salinity Carbonate
   Reservoirs}},

Abstract = {{To improve sweep efficiency for carbon dioxide (CO2) enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR) up to 120 degrees C in the presence of high-salinity
   brine (182 g/L NaCl), novel CO2/water (C/W) foams have been formed with
   surfactants composed of ethoxylated amine headgroups with cocoalkyl
   tails. These surfactants are switchable from the nonionic (unprotonated
   amine) state in dry CO2 to cationic (protonated amine) in the presence
   of an aqueous phase with a pH less than 6. The high hydrophilicity in
   the protonated cationic state was evident in the high cloudpoint
   temperature up to 120 degrees C. The high cloud point facilitated the
   stabilization of lamellae between bubbles in CO2/water foams. In the
   nonionic form, the surfactant was soluble in CO2 at 120 degrees C and
   3,300 psia at a concentration of 0.2\% (w/w). C/W foams were produced by
   injecting the surfactant into either the CO2 phase or the brine phase,
   which indicated good contact between phases for transport of surfactant
   to the interface. Solubility of the surfactant in CO2 and a favorable
   C/W partition coefficient are beneficial for transport of surfactant
   with CO2-flow pathways in the reservoir to minimize viscous fingering
   and gravity override. The ethoxylated coco-amine with two ethylene oxide
   (EO) groups was shown to stabilize C/W foams in a 30-darcy sandpack with
   NaCl concentrations up to 182 g/L at 120 degrees C and 3,400 psia, and
   foam qualities from 50 to 95\%. The foam produces an apparent viscosity
   of 6.2 cp in the sandpack and 6.3 cp in a 762-mu m-inner-diameter
   capillary tube (downstream of the sandpack) in contrast with values well
   below 1 cp without surfactant present. Moreover, the cationic headgroup
   reduces the adsorption of ethoxylated alkyl amines on calcite, which is
   also positively charged in the presence of CO2 dissolved in brine. The
   surfactant partition coefficients (0 to 0.04) favored the water phase
   over the oil phase, which is beneficial for minimizing losses of
   surfactant to the oil phase for efficient surfactant usage. Furthermore,
   the surfactant was used to form C/W foams, without forming
   stable/viscous oil/water (O/W) emulsions. This selectivity is desirable
   for mobility control whereby CO2 will have low mobility in regions in
   which oil is not present and high contact with oil at the displacement
   front. In summary, the switchable ethoxylated alkyl amine surfactants
   provide both high cloudpoints in brine and high interfacial activities
   of ionic surfactants in water for foam generation, as well as
   significant solubilities in CO2 in the nonionic dry state for surfactant
   injection.}},

Title = {{Development of an Efficient Embedded Discrete Fracture Model for 3D
   Compositional Reservoir Simulation in Fractured Reservoirs}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Many naturally fractured reservoirs around the world have depleted
   significantly, and improved-oil-recovery (IOR) processes are necessary
   for further development. Hence, the modeling of fractured reservoirs has
   received increased attention recently. Accurate modeling and simulation
   of naturally fractured reservoirs (NFRs) is still challenging because of
   permeability anisotropies and contrasts. Nonphysical abstractions
   inherent in conventional dual-porosity and dual-permeability models make
   them inadequate for solving different fluid-flow problems in fractured
   reservoirs. Also, recent technologies for discrete fracture modeling may
   suffer from large simulation run times, and the industry has not used
   such approaches widely, even though they give more-accurate
   representations of fractured reservoirs than dual-continuum models.
   We developed an embedded discrete fracture model (DFM) for an in-house
   compositional reservoir simulator that borrows the dual-medium concept
   from conventional dual-continuum models and also incorporates the effect
   of each fracture explicitly. The model is compatible with existing
   finite-difference reservoir simulators. In contrast to dual-continuum
   models, fractures have arbitrary orientations and can be oblique or
   vertical, honoring the complexity of a typical NFR. The accuracy of the
   embedded DFM is confirmed by comparing the results with the fine-grid,
   explicit-fracture simulations for a case study including orthogonal
   fractures and a case with a nonaligned fracture. We also perform a
   grid-sensitivity study to show the convergence of the method as the grid
   is refined. Our simulations indicate that to achieve accurate results,
   the embedded discrete fracture model may only require moderate mesh
   refinement around the fractures and hence offers a computationally
   efficient approach. Furthermore, examples of waterflooding, gas
   injection, and primary depletion are presented to demonstrate the
   performance and applicability of the developed method for simulating
   fluid flow in NFRs.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Recently, tie-simplex-based phase-behavior modeling in reservoir
   simulators has been applied and investigated as a potential method for
   improving the computational speed of equation-of-state (EOS)-based
   reservoir simulators. We implemented compositional-space adaptive
   tabulation (CSAT), the most promising tie-simplex-based method, in
   UTCOMP, the University of Texas' in-house IMPEC compositional reservoir
   simulator, to investigate its computational efficiency compared with the
   phase-behavior algorithm in UTCOMP. The results show that applying CSAT
   only to skip stability analysis does improve computational time, but
   only when a significant portion of the gridblocks are in the
   single-phase region and no other technique for avoiding stability
   analysis is used. However, in most cases, there is little or no
   computational advantage to use of CSAT when the simple option in UTCOMP
   is used where stability analysis is skipped for blocks surrounded by
   single-phase regions. We explore in detail the performance of CSAT,
   which depends significantly on the specific gas flood modeled, and the
   number of tie-lines generated during adaptive tabulation. The results
   shed light on applicability of CSAT in the IMPEC-type compositional
   reservoir simulators and show that the advantages of CSAT in this type
   of simulator are not as great as are reported in the literature for
   fully implicit or adaptive implicit formulations.}},

Abstract = {{The use of bubble resonance effects to attenuate low-frequency
   underwater sound was investigated experimentally in a large water tank.
   A compact electromechanical sound source was used to excite standing
   wave fields at frequencies ranging between 50 and 200 Hz in the tank.
   The source was then surrounded by a stationary array of tethered
   encapsulated air bubbles, and reduction in standing wave amplitude by as
   much as 26 dB was observed. The bubbles consisted of either thin-shelled
   latex balloons with approximately 5 cm radii or thicker-shelled vinyl
   boat fenders with 6.9 cm radii. The effects of changing the material and
   thickness of the bubble shells were found to be in qualitative agreement
   with predictions from Church's model for sound propagation in a liquid
   containing encapsulated bubbles {[}J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 97, 1510-1521
   (1995)]. Although demonstrated here for low frequency noise abatement
   within a tank, which is useful for quieting acoustic test facilities and
   large tanks used for marine life husbandry, the eventual aim of this
   work is to use stationary arrays of large tethered encapsulated bubbles
   to abate low frequency underwater noise from anthropogenic sources in

Abstract = {{We measured nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation times on samples
   from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 333 Sites C0011,
   C0012, and C0018. We compared our results to permeability, grain size,
   and specific surface measurements, pore size distributions from mercury
   injection capillary pressure, and mineralogy from X-ray fluorescence. We
   found that permeability could be predicted from NMR measurements by
   including grain size and specific surface to quantify pore networks and
   that grain size is the most important factor in relating NMR response to
   permeability. Samples within zones of anomalously high porosity from
   Sites C0011 and C0012 were found to have different NMR-permeability
   relationships than samples from outside these zones, suggesting that the
   porosity anomaly is related to a fundamental difference in pore
   structure. We additionally estimated the size of paramagnetic sites that
   cause proton relaxation and found that in most of our samples,
   paramagnetic material is present mainly as discrete, clay-sized grains.
   This distribution of paramagnetic material may cause pronounced
   heterogeneity in NMR properties at the pore scale that is not accounted
   for in most NMR interpretation techniques. Our results provide important
   insight into the microstructure of marine sediments in the Nankai

Abstract = {{Owing to the increasingly large volume and complexity of captured
   videos, renewable energy systems based on solar energy are of particular
   interest in the design of energy harvesting (EH) wireless visual sensor
   networks (WVSNs). Since additional energy consumption following image
   capture occurs owing to image processing, mote operation, data
   transmission, and reception, the capture rate significantly affects the
   lifetime of a node. To this end, we explore a novel energy-efficient
   framework for EH-WVSN design by developing an optimal algorithm named
   capture rate and pervasive network control for multicamera networks
   where the quality of service is maximized by obtaining optimal values
   for the capture rate, allocated energy, and transmit power, based on
   field of view-based networking in the presence of event and power
   acquisition patterns. Through simulations, we demonstrate the
   feasibility of EH-WVSNs in terms of energy consumption, energy
   allocation, and capture rate in a realistic scenario (parking

Abstract = {{We describe a new 3D saliency prediction model that accounts for diverse
   low-level luminance, chrominance, motion, and depth attributes of 3D
   videos as well as high-level classifications of scenes by type. The
   model also accounts for perceptual factors, such as the nonuniform
   resolution of the human eye, stereoscopic limits imposed by Panum's
   fusional area, and the predicted degree of (dis) comfort felt, when
   viewing the 3D video. The high-level analysis involves classification of
   each 3D video scene by type with regard to estimated camera motion and
   the motions of objects in the videos. Decisions regarding the relative
   saliency of objects or regions are supported by data obtained through a
   series of eye-tracking experiments. The algorithm developed from the
   model elements operates by finding and segmenting salient 3D space-time
   regions in a video, then calculating the saliency strength of each
   segment using measured attributes of motion, disparity, texture, and the
   predicted degree of visual discomfort experienced. The saliency energy
   of both segmented objects and frames are weighted using models of human
   foveation and Panum's fusional area yielding a single predictor of 3D
   saliency.}},

Abstract = {{Smoking is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cardiac
   patients. However, data on the prognostic impact of smoking in heart
   failure (HF) patients on cardiac resynchronization therapy with
   defibrillator (CRT-D) are absent. We investigated the effects of smoking
   on all-cause mortality and on a composite endpoint (all-cause
   death/appropriate device therapy), appropriate and inappropriate device
   therapy, in 649 patients with HF who underwent CRT-D between January
   2003 and October 2011 in 6 Centers (4 in Italy and 2 in USA). 68
   patients were current smokers, 396 previous-smokers (patients who had
   smoked in the past but who had quit before the CRT-D implant), and 185
   had never smoked. The risk of each endpoint by smoking status was
   evaluated with both Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazard analysis.
   After adjusting for age, left ventricular ejection fraction, QRS width
   and ischemic etiology, both current and previous smoking were
   independent predictors of all-cause death {[}HR = 5.07 (95 \% CI
   2.68-9.58), p < 0.001 and HR = 2.43 (95 \% CI 1.38-4.29), p = 0.002,
   respectively) and of composite endpoint {[}HR = 1.63 (1.04-2.56); p =
   0.033 and HR = 1.46 (1.04-2.04) p = 0.027]. In addition, current smokers
   had a significantly higher rate of inappropriate device therapy compared
   to never smokers {[}HR = 21.74 (4.53-104.25), p = 0.005]. Our study
   indicates that in patients with HF who received a CRT-D device, current
   and previous smoking increase the event rate per person-time of death
   and of appropriate and inappropriate ICD therapy more than other known
   negative prognostic factors such as age, left ventricular dysfunction,
   prolonged QRS duration and ischemic etiology.}},

Abstract = {{The stable ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formed between the
   Lactococcus lactis group II intron and its self-encoded LtrA protein is
   essential for the intron's genetic mobility. In this study, we report
   the biochemical, compositional, hydrodynamic and structural properties
   of active group II intron RNP particles (+A) isolated from its native
   host using a novel purification scheme. We employed small-angle X-ray
   scattering to determine the structural properties of these particles as
   they exist in solution. Using sucrose as a contrasting agent, we derived
   a two-phase quaternary model of the protein-RNA complex. This approach
   revealed that the spatial properties of the complex are largely defined
   by the RNA component, with the protein dimer located near the center of
   mass. A transfer RNA fusion engineered into domain II of the intron
   provided a distinct landmark consistent with this interpretation.
   Comparison of the derived +A RNP shape with that of the previously
   reported precursor intron (Delta A) particle extends previous findings
   that the loosely packed precursor RNP undergoes a dramatic
   conformational change as it compacts into its active form. Our results
   provide insights into the quaternary arrangement of these RNP complexes
   in solution, an important step to understanding the transition of the
   group II intron from the precursor to a species fully active for DNA
   invasion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a decentralized observer with a consensus filter for
   the state observation of discrete-time linear distributed systems. Each
   agent in the distributed system has an observer with a model of the
   plant that utilizes the set of locally available measurements, which may
   not make the full plant state detectable. This lack of detectability is
   overcome by utilizing a consensus filter that blends the state estimate
   of each agent with its neighbors' estimates. It is proven that the state
   estimates of the proposed observer exponentially converge to the actual
   plant states under arbitrarily changing, but connected, communication
   and pseudo-connected sensing graph topologies. Except these connectivity
   properties, full knowledge of the sensing and communication graphs is
   not needed at the design time. As a byproduct, we obtained a result on
   the location of eigenvalues, i.e., the spectrum, of the Laplacian for a
   family of graphs with self-loops. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The rise of plasmonic metamaterials in recent years has unveiled the
   possibility of revolutionizing the entire field of optics and photonics,
   challenging well-established technological limitations and paving the
   way to innovations at an unprecedented level. To capitalize the
   disruptive potential of this rising field of science and technology, it
   is important to be able to combine the richness of optical phenomena
   enabled by nanoplasmonics in order to realize metamaterial components,
   devices, and systems of increasing complexity. Here, we review a few
   recent research directions in the field of plasmonic metamaterials,
   which may foster further advancements in this research area. We will
   discuss the anomalous scattering features enabled by plasmonic
   nanoparticles and nanoclusters, and show how they may represent the
   fundamental building blocks of complex nanophotonic architectures.
   Building on these concepts, advanced components can be designed and
   operated, such as optical nanoantennas and nanoantenna arrays, which, in
   turn, may be at the basis of metasurface devices and complex systems.
   Following this path, from basic phenomena to advanced functionalities,
   the field of plasmonic metamaterials offers the promise of an important
   scientific and technological impact, with applications spanning from
   medical diagnostics to clean energy and information processing.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the transport of surface-treated superparamagnetic
   iron-oxide nanoparticles in Boise-sandstone rocks by injecting aqueous
   dispersions of the particles into core plugs. Several different surface
   treatments yield stable dispersions of these particles, but provide very
   different transport characteristics. Effluent concentration histories
   are measured to obtain the particle retention in the rock. The results
   are used to optimize the particle surface coating so that the reservoir
   application requirements for the functional nanoparticles can be
   achieved. The application of interest here requires the nanoparticles to
   adsorb to oil/water interfaces.
   Our earlier experiments (Yu et al., 2010) showed that the paramagnetic
   nanoparticles stabilized with small negatively-charged citrate ligands
   have little retention in sedimentary rocks, but their preferred
   adsorption at the oil/water interfaces in rock pores was not achieved. A
   major improvement in surface coating optimization is achieved by
   creating a crosslinked polymer film that wraps around the nanoparticle
   so that it does not detach from the particle surface even under the
   harsh reservoir conditions. To fine-tune the coating to satisfy the
   reservoir application requirements, co-polymers and ter-polymers with
   different constituent monomers are employed. Nanoparticles stabilized
   with (polystyrene sulfonate-alt-maleic acid) coating show a good
   adsorption tendency at the oil/water interfaces, while with very low
   adsorption at rock surface (similar to 0.02 mg/m(2)). The dispersion
   also has long-term stability even at high salinity (8 wt\% NaCl). Other
   polymers, such as (polyacrylic acid-r-butyl acrylate), (polyacrylic
   acid-b-styrene sulfonic acid), and (polyacrylic acid-r-butyl
   acrylate-b-styrene sulfonic acid), were also tested. The coating with
   the last polymer (PAA-PBA-PSS) provides a very low retention of
   particles in the rock, but only marginal preferred adsorption at
   oil/water interfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We show how both the tridiagonal and bidiagonal QR algorithms can be
   restructured so that they become rich in operations that can achieve
   near-peak performance on a modern processor. The key is a novel,
   cache-friendly algorithm for applying multiple sets of Givens rotations
   to the eigenvector/singular vector matrix. This algorithm is then
   implemented with optimizations that: (1) leverage vector instruction
   units to increase floating-point throughput, and (2) fuse multiple
   rotations to decrease the total number of memory operations. We
   demonstrate the merits of these new QR algorithms for computing the
   Hermitian eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and singular value
   decomposition (SVD) of dense matrices when all eigenvectors/ singular
   vectors are computed. The approach yields vastly improved performance
   relative to traditional QR algorithms for these problems and is
   competitive with two commonly used alternatives-Cuppen's
   Divide-and-Conquer algorithm and the method of Multiple Relatively
   Robust Representations-while inheriting the more modest O(n) workspace
   requirements of the original QR algorithms. Since the computations
   performed by the restructured algorithms remain essentially identical to
   those performed by the original methods, robust numerical properties are
   preserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new orthochelated salt, lithium bis(monofluoromalonato)borate
   (LiBFMB), is synthesized and purified for application in lithium-ion
   batteries. The presence of fluorine in the borate anion of LiBFMB
   increases its oxidation potential and also facilitates ion dissociation,
   as reflected by the ratio of ionic conductivity (sigma(exp)) and ion
   diffusivity coefficients (sigma(NMR)). Half-cell tests using 5.0 V
   lithium nickel manganese oxide (LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4) as a cathode and
   ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/diethyl carbonate
   (DEC)as a solvent reveals that the impedance of the LiBFMB cell is much
   larger than those of LiPF6- and lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB)-based
   cells, which results in lower capacity and poor cycling performance of
   the former. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results for the
   cycled cathode electrode suggest that because of the stability of the
   LiBFMB salt, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the
   cathode surface is significantly different from those of LiPF6 and LiBOB
   based electrolytes, resulting in more solvent decomposition and a
   thicker SEI layer. Initial results also indicate that using a high
   dielectric constant solvent, propylene carbonate, alters the surface
   chemistry, reduces the interfacial impedance, and enhances the
   performance of LiBFMB-based 5.0 V cell.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate various numerical strategies to compute
   the direct space polarization energy and associated forces in the
   context of the point dipole approximation (including damping) used in
   polarizable molecular dynamics. We present a careful mathematical
   analysis of the algorithms that have been implemented in popular
   production packages and applied to large test systems. We show that the
   classical Jacobi Over-Relaxation method (JOR) should not be used as its
   convergence requires a proper value of the relaxation parameter, whereas
   other strategies should be preferred. On a single. node, Preconditioned
   Conjugate Gradient methods (PCG) and Jacobi algorithm coupled with the
   Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (JI/DIIS) provide reliable
   stability/convergence and are roughly twice as fast as JOR. Moreover,
   both algorithms are suitable for massively parallel implementations. The
   lower requirements in terms of processes communications make JI/DIIS the
   method of choice for MPI and hybrid OpenMP/MPI paradigms for real life
   tests. Furthermore, using a predictor step as a guess along a molecular
   dynamics simulation provides another inexpensive, yet very effective,
   form of convergence acceleration. Overall, two to three orders of
   magnitude in time can be gained compared to the initial JOR single node
   approach to the final PGC or JI/DIIS parallel one combined with the.
   predictors MD refinements. Such a speedup traces a new route for the
   high performance implementation of polarizable molecular dynamics and
   therefore extends the applicability of the technique as it will
   facilitate future multiscale QM/MM/continuum computations.}},

Abstract = {{Although various ophthalmic imaging methods, including fundus
   photography and optical coherence tomography, have been applied for
   effective diagnosis of ocular diseases with high spatial resolution,
   most of them are limited by shallow imaging penetration depth and a
   narrow field of view. Also, many of those imaging modalities are
   optimized to provide microscopic anatomical information, while
   functional or cellular information is lacking. Compared to other ocular
   imaging modalities, photoacoustic imaging can achieve relatively deep
   penetration depth and provide more detailed functional and cellular data
   based on photoacoustic signal generation from endogenous contrast agents
   such as hemoglobin and melanin. In this paper, array-based ultrasound
   and photoacoustic imaging was demonstrated to visualize pigmentation in
   the eye as well as overall ocular structure. Fresh porcine eyes were
   visualized using a real-time ultrasound micro-imaging system and an
   imaging probe supporting laser pulse delivery. In addition, limited
   photoacoustic imaging field of view was improved by an imaging probe
   tilting method, enabling visualization of most regions of the retina
   covered in the ultrasound imaging.}},

Title = {{Influence of polyimide precursor synthesis route and ortho-position

Abstract = {{Thermal rearrangement of polyimides with ortho-position groups to
   polybenzoxazoles and related structures has been of recent interest for
   producing gas separation membranes. This study explores the influence of
   synthesis route and ortho-position functional group on the thermal
   rearrangement process and the fractional free volume of thermally
   rearranged (TR) polymers produced from polyimides derived from
   3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-biphenyl and 2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)
   hexafluoropropane dianhydride (HAB-6FDA). Acetate, propanoate, and
   pivalate ortho-position functional groups were considered.
   Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to study thermal rearrangement
   at temperatures between 350 and 450 degrees C, and evolved gases from
   TGA were analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize the byproducts
   of thermal rearrangement and thermal degradation. CO2 was the major
   byproduct of thermal rearrangement for all samples, and its evolution
   began well before the onset of thermal degradation. When non-hydroxyl
   ortho-position groups were present in the polymers, several byproducts
   other than CO2 were also observed due to the loss of these
   ortho-position groups before thermal rearrangement. Free volume
   generally increased with increasing extent of thermal rearrangement, but
   precise values of free volume could not be accurately determined for
   polymers with propanoate and pivalate ortho-position functional groups
   due to uncertainties in the chemical structure of partially converted
   materials. For polymers with acetate and hydroxyl ortho-position groups,
   free volume could be determined within the uncertainty of density
   measurements. Thermal rearrangement behavior and free volume results for
   acetate containing polymers synthesized via different routes were very
   similar. Based on these results, the chemical structure of the
   ortho-position functional group has a larger impact on TR polymer
   properties than the polyimide precursor synthesis route. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We study the efficacy of utilizing a powerful image descriptor, the
   curvelet transform, to learn a no-reference (NR) image quality
   assessment (IQA) model. A set of statistical features are extracted from
   a computed image curvelet representation, including the coordinates of
   the maxima of the log-histograms of the curvelet coefficients values,
   and the energy distributions of both orientation and scale in the
   curvelet domain. Our results indicate that these features are sensitive
   to the presence and severity of image distortion. Operating within a
   2-stage framework of distortion classification followed by quality
   assessment, we train an image distortion and quality prediction engine
   using a support vector machine (SVM). The resulting algorithm, dubbed
   CurveletQA for short, was tested on the LIVE IQA database and compared
   to state-of-the-art NR/FR IQA algorithms. We found that CurveletQA
   correlates well with human subjective opinions of image quality,
   delivering performance that is competitive with popular full-reference
   (FR) IQA algorithms such as SSIM, and with top-performing NR IQA models.
   At the same time, CurveletQA has a relatively low complexity.(c) 2014

Abstract = {{A conundrum exists in the US Pacific Northwest (PNW) whereby
   increasingly stringent federal environmental regulations governing the
   discharge of nutrients from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) to low
   order streams may negatively impact salmonid species listed under the US
   Endangered Species Act (ESA). We examined baseflow, water chemistry,
   benthic algal biomass, macroinvertebrate diversity, and steelhead in the
   West Fork Little Bear Creek (WFLBC), Idaho, USA, above and below the
   city of Troy WWTP to explain why this creek is the most productive
   juvenile steelhead stream in the Potlatch River drainage. Discharge from
   the WWTP maintained 6 km of perennial flow during summer. Dissolved
   oxygen (DO) levels indicate that nitrification depressed DO below the
   Idaho state standard of 6 mg/L within the first 200 m downstream of the
   discharge. Because of rapid re-aeration, DO concentrations recovered by
   1.3 km. Despite high nitrate (0.12 - 4.3 mg/L) and total phosphorus
   (0.11 - 0.60 mg/L) concentrations 2.5 km downstream, benthic algal
   biomass remained below the US Environmental Protection Agency's nuisance
   algae' level (i.e., 150 mg/m(2)) throughout the stream. Family biotic
   index indicated good water quality conditions above and 2.5 km
   downstream of the discharge, although fairly poor condictions were found
   200 m downstream from the effluent. The WFLBC ecosystem appears to have
   the capacity to accept and actually benefit from high nutrient loads
   from a WWTP. This work emphasizes the importance of developing a
   thorough understanding of the site-specific biochemical functioning of
   an ecosystem before selecting and applying standard management
   practices. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Wax crystallization is a serious problem because it may result in the
   plugging of wellbores, production facilities, and transportation
   pipelines during oil production. This study describes the use of a novel
   high-pressure ultrasonic detection system as a reliable technique to
   evaluate the wax appearance temperature (WAT) and the wax precipitated
   curve (WPC) of both crude oil {[}stock tank oil (STO)] and live oil at
   pressures up to 22.87 MPa. The oil sample was from Kingfisher ((F)
   oilfield, which is a typical high waxy reservoir. Transit time and
   amplitude were demonstrated to be good indicators for WAT determination
   with the ultrasonic method, which could not only self-verify but also
   distinguish the different stages of the complex process of wax
   crystallization. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   and the rheometry method under ambient pressure were also presented to
   match the ultrasonic method. The obtained WAT data are comparable to
   results from DSC and rheometry, which could be used to further optimize
   the modeling of wax deposition. Moreover, the amount of wax precipitated
   could also be estimated by the ultrasonic method, and the WPC is very
   close to the curve obtained by DSC. It is also concluded that WAT
   experiments on live oils must be conducted because the measured dead oil
   WAT may provide too conservative and unrealistic estimates because of
   the composition and pressure difference. Thus, for oil production and
   transportation, the addition of solution gas or just to maintain the
   dissolution gas in contact with the crude oil may reduce the risk of wax
   precipitation and then drop all of the costs related to wax removal. For
   high-waxy oilfields, such as KF reservoirs, multiphase production and
   transport may be an economic solution.}},

Abstract = {{Prohibitive simulation time with pre-silicon design models and
   unavailability of proprietary target applications make microprocessor
   design very tedious. The framework proposed in this paper is the first
   attempt to automatically generate synthetic benchmark proxies for real
   world multithreaded applications. The framework includes metrics that
   characterize the behavior of the workloads in the shared caches,
   coherence logic, out-of-order cores, interconnection network and DRAM.
   The framework is evaluated by generating proxies for the workloads in
   the multithreaded PARSEC benchmark suite and validating their fidelity
   by comparing the microarchitecture dependent and independent metrics to
   that of the original workloads. The average error in IPC is 4.87 percent
   and maximum error is 10.8 percent for Raytrace in comparison to the
   original workloads. The average error in the power-per-cycle metric is
   2.73 percent with a maximum of 5.5 percent when compared to original
   workloads. The representativeness of the proxies to that of the original
   workloads in terms of their sensitivity to design changes is evaluated
   by finding the correlation coefficient between the trends followed by
   the synthetic and the original for design changes in IPC, which is 0.92.
   A speedup of four to six orders of magnitude is achieved by using the
   synthetic proxies over the original workloads.}},

   negative compressibility in MoS2. We are able to interpret our
   measurements quantitatively by accounting for disorder and using the
   random phase approximation (RPA) for the exchange and correlation
   energies of both Dirac and parabolic-band two-dimensional electron
   gases. This interpretation allows us to extract the energetic offset

Abstract = {{The development of rotary nanomotors is crucial for advancing
   nanoelectromechanical system technology. In this work, we report design,
   assembly and rotation of ordered arrays of nanomotors. The nanomotors
   are bottom-up assembled from nanoscale building blocks with nanowires as
   rotors, patterned nanomagnets as bearings and quadrupole microelectrodes
   as stators. Arrays of nanomotors rotate with controlled angle, speed
   (over 18,000 r.p.m.), and chirality by electric fields. Using analytical
   modelling, we reveal the fundamental nanoscale electrical, mechanical
   and magnetic interactions in the nanomotor system, which excellently
   agrees with experimental results and provides critical understanding for
   designing metallic nanoelectromechanical systems. The nanomotors can be
   continuously rotated for 15 h over 240,000 cycles. They are applied for
   controlled biochemical release and demonstrate releasing rate of
   biochemicals on nanoparticles that can be precisely tuned by mechanical
   rotations. The innovations reported in this research, from concept,
   design and actuation to application, are relevant to
   nanoelectromechanical system, nanomedicine, microfluidics and

   A correlation was drawn between addition of nanoparticles and degree of

   property termed the ``reinforcement gap.{''} This gap has been
   associated with TPU dripping behavior at high temperatures. It is

Abstract = {{High quality Cu2ZnSn(SSe)(4) (CZTSSe) for solar cells can be fabricated
   with Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals, followed by a selenization process.
   However, the use of toxic and environmentally unfriendly solvents such
   as toluene or hexanethiol to disperse the nanocrystals and the use of
   the harsh selenization process to promote the grain growth are not
   environmentally benign. We present here an environmentally friendly,
   sustainable, and scalable route to fabricate CZTSSe with Cu2ZnSnSe4
   (CTZSe) nanocrystals by a sulfurization process. The CZTSSe film has
   been doped with S to optimize the device performance, exhibiting an
   enhancement in the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and short circuit current
   density (J(sc)). In addition, by developing a robust precursor film with
   the addition of ethyl cellulose, the loss of Sn associated with the
   conversion of CZTSe to CZTSSe during the grain growth process has been
   mitigated, leading to an increase in the conversion efficiency compared
   to that of the precursor film without using ethyl cellulose. Such an
   improvement can provide insight into the grain growth of CZTSSe during
   the sulfurization process and thereby enhance the feasibility of
   sustainable high efficiency CZTSSe solar devices. KEYWORDS: Solar cells,

Abstract = {{An effective way to tailor the physicochemical properties of graphene
   film is developed by combining colloidal suspensions of reduced graphene
   oxide (rG-O) nanosheets and exfoliated layered titanate nanosheets for
   the fabrication of freestanding hybrid films comprised of stacked and
   overlapped nanosheets. A flow-directed filtration of such mixed
   colloidal suspensions yields freestanding hybrid films comprised of
   strongly-coupled rG-O and titanate nanosheets with tunable chemical
   composition. This is the first example of highly flexible hybrid films
   composed of graphene and metal oxide nanosheets. The intimate
   incorporation of layered titanate nanosheets into the graphene film
   gives rise not only to an increase of mechanical strength but also to
   increased surface roughness, chemical stability, and hydrophilicity;
   thus, the physicochemical properties of the graphene film can be tuned
   by hybridization with inorganic nanosheets. These freestanding hybrid
   films of rG-O-layered titanate show unprecedentedly high antibacterial
   property, resulting in the complete sterilization of Escherichia coli
   O157:H7 (approximate to 100\%) in the very short time of 15 min. The
   antibacterial activity of the hybrid film is far superior to that of the
   pure graphene film, underscoring the beneficial effect of the layered
   metal oxide nanosheets in improving the functionality of the graphene
   film.}},

Abstract = {{The classic and Taylor series of Keplerian motion are extended to solve
   the Stark problem and to use the generalized Sundman transformation.
   Exact recursion formulas for the series coefficients are derived, and
   the method is implemented to high order via a symbolic manipulator. The
   results lead to fast and accurate propagation models with efficient
   discretizations. The new and Stark series solutions are compared to the
   Modern Taylor Series (MTS) and 8th order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF8)
   solutions. In terms of runtime, the and approach is shown to compare
   favorably to the MTS method up to order 20, and both Taylor series
   methods enjoy approximate order of magnitude speedups compared to RKF8
   implementations. Actual runtime is shown to vary with eccentricity,
   perturbation size, prescribed accuracy, and the Sundman power law. The
   method and results are valid for both the Stark and the Kepler problems.
   The effects of the generalized Sundman transformation on the accuracy of
   the propagation are analyzed. The Taylor series solutions are shown to
   be exceptionally efficient when the unity power law from the classic
   Sundman transformation is applied. An example low-thrust trajectory
   propagation demonstrates the utility of the and Stark series solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Small scale lean combustors, in conjunction with mechanical and
   electrical conversion devices, have the potential to meet increasing
   portable power needs. This study examines the combustion of lean
   premixed fuels in a mesoscale, heat-recirculating parallel-plate
   counter-flow reactor. The reactor utilizes internal heat recirculation
   to produce temperatures in excess of the adiabatic flame temperature,
   known as superadiabatic combustion. As a result of these elevated
   temperatures, burning velocities above adiabatic values and extension of
   flammability limits, including stable operation at very lean equivalence
   ratios, may be attained. Combustor stability and emissions of carbon
   monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbons have been
   previously studied for lean combustion of methane in the counter-flow
   reactor. This study examines lean combustion of two increasingly complex
   fuels, propane and heptane, due to the logistical importance of both
   gaseous and liquid fuels. Stability ranges and emissions measurements
   are presented for the counter-flow reactor operating on these fuels, and
   the results are compared to previously measured emissions for lean
   methane. Stability ranges of the counter-flow reactor operating on lean
   propane and heptane are also compared to those in the rich regime.
   Further analysis of the results for lean methane, propane and heptane
   combustion utilizes peak reactor wall temperatures as an indicator of
   favorable operating conditions, and highlights the importance of
   superadiabatic operation for achieving large turn-down ratios and low
   levels of emissions. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Title = {{Sensitivity of dipole magnetic tomography to magnetic nanoparticle
   injectates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{199-214}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We compare the sensitivity of magnetic field measurements to
   perturbations of magnetic permeability with the field sensitivity to
   conductivity alterations. The conductivity perturbations can be caused
   by the different conductivity of the injected and formation resident
   fluid and the magnetic permeability perturbations by injecting magnetic
   nanopartides. We devise a simple method for calculating the magnetic
   permeability sensitivity required to solve parametric inverse problems
   in electromagnetic (EM) tomography involving magnetic permeability
   perturbations. We apply the method in 3D and 2D axisymmetric to both
   crosswell and single-well configurations in a homogeneous background.
   The emphasis of this paper is on measurements acquired at very low
   induction numbers (kr << 1; k being the wave number and r the distance)
   where the wave length or the skin depth becomes an irrelevant scale.
   The sensitivity to magnetic permeability perturbations is significantly
   higher than conductivity perturbations at low frequencies. Furthermore,
   at the low-frequency regime, the magnetic permeability sensitivity is
   largely independent of frequency, unlike the conductivity sensitivity
   which improves with frequency, consistent with quasi-static dipole
   magnetics. The sensitivity patterns for conductivity and magnetic
   permeability are quite different. The four lobes with opposite signs
   surrounding the source and receiver in case of magnetic permeability
   provide opportunities for vertical discrimination of magnetic
   measurements. In the case of a single-well configuration, the
   sensitivity to magnetic permeability perturbation is larger close to the
   wellbore than conductivity. Also, the sign reversals of both real and
   imaginary parts of the magnetic permeability enhance the horizontal
   sensitivity of the magnetic measurements.
   The geometry of the problem also affects the sensitivities quite
   significantly. Both 3D and 2D axisymmetric are considered in this study.
   The geometrical spreading of the perturbed region in the axisymmetric
   case suppresses the sensitivity value for both conductivity and magnetic
   permeability.
   The magnetic permeability perturbations exhibit a higher sensitivity
   when the magnetic contrast agents are in the proximity of the source and
   receivers (or near the wellbore in case of single-well). On the other
   hand, EM measurements are more sensitive to conductivity perturbations
   in the interwell region in the case of a crosswell and off-wellbore in
   the case of a single-well system at moderate and high frequencies. (C)

Abstract = {{Conventional large-core multimode fibers (MMFs) are preferred for use in
   short to medium haul optical fiber links, owing to their tolerance to
   misalignment and low deployment costs; however, data rates through MMFs
   are limited by modal dispersion. Digital signal processing with
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques has offered promising
   solutions to overcome the dispersion limitations of MMFs, but the impact
   of the geometry of laser and detector arrays on the achievable data rate
   is not established. To this end, we use a field-propagation-based model
   to gauge the impact the geometry of lasers and detectors can have on the
   achievable ergodic and outage rates of incoherent MIMO-MMF links. Laser
   and detector array geometries were investigated using a grid-based
   method to optimize the positions of lasers and detectors for a 1km
   MIMO-MMF link. Simulations reveal that systems with appropriately
   designed laser/detector geometries could improve the achievable rate
   over the fiber by more than 200\% over random laser/detector arrays. The
   grid-based search technique, however, is limited due to high
   computational requirements for fine grids. As an alternative, we
   developed a suboptimal ``greedy{''} selection approach to design
   detector geometries, which produces detector geometries that attain more
   than 90\% of the rate obtained with an exhaustive search, while
   requiring less than 0.2\% of the computation. The low computation
   requirements and high performance of the greedy selection approach also
   motivate the use of dynamically reconfigurable detector arrays to
   achieve high data rates with reduced signal processing complexity.
   Methods are also presented for clustering detector elements to obtain
   more consolidated segmented detectors with better fill factors, while
   still offering significant data rate benefits. The achievable ergodic
   rate using these systems is verified to be close to the link's ergodic
   capacity.}},

Title = {{Effect of pore structure on the producibility of tight-gas sandstones}},
Journal = {{AAPG BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{663-694}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) is one of the most significant
   properties of tight-gas sandstone reservoirs, but it remains difficult
   to predict. Estimated ultimate recovery is dependent on the success of
   stimulation by hydraulic fracturing, the existence and connectivity of
   natural fractures, and as illustrated in this article, the pore
   structure of the matrix. Here, we analyze the lab measurements that are
   indicative of the pore structure, and then we predict the effect of pore
   structure on producibility. We develop a relationship between the EUR of
   tight-gas sandstones and their petrophysical properties measured by
   drainage and imbibition tests (mercury intrusion, withdrawal, and porous
   plate) and by resistivity analyses. We use the ratio of residual mercury
   saturation after mercury withdrawal (S-gr) to initial mercury saturation
   (S-gi), which is the saturation at the start of withdrawal, as,a measure
   of gas likely to be trapped in the matrix during production and, hence,
   a proxy for EUR. A multi-type pore space model is required to explain
   mercury intrusion capillary pressures in these rocks. Implications of
   this model are supported by other available laboratory measurements. The
   model comprises a conventional network model and a treelike pore
   structure (an acyclic network) that mimic the intergranular and
   intragranular void spaces, respectively. The notion of the treelike pore
   structure is introduced here for the first time in the context of
   tight-gas sandstones. Applying the multi-type model to porous plate
   data, we classify the pore spaces of rocks into intergranular dominant,
   intermediate, and intragranular dominant. This pore space classification
   is topological and is not based on scale or size. These classes have
   progressively less drainage and imbibition hysteresis, which leads to
   the prediction that significantly more hydrocarbon is recoverable from
   intragranular porosity than intergranular porosity. Available field data
   (production logs) corroborate the higher producibility of intervals with
   intragranular porosity, although the data are not sufficient to
   eliminate the possible contribution of other factors such as size and
   shape of the volume contacted by hydraulic fractures or the presence and
   attributes of natural fractures. The superior recovery of hydrocarbon
   from intragranular-dominant pore structures is despite its inferior
   initial production rate.}},

   healthy subjects. Angular momentum was calculated using a 13-segment
   whole-body model. GRFs, externalmoment arms and net joint moments were
   used to interpret the angular momentum results. The range of frontal
   plane angular momentum was greater for stair ascent relative to level
   walking. In the transverse and sagittal planes, the range of angular
   momentum was smaller in stair ascent and descent relative to level
   walking. Significant differences were also found in the ground reaction
   forces, external moment arms and net joint moments. The sagittal plane
   angular momentum results suggest that individuals alter angular momentum
   to effectively counteract potential trips during stair ascent, and
   reduce the range of angular momentum to avoid falling forward during
   stair descent. Further, significant differences in joint moments suggest
   potential neuromuscular mechanisms that account for the differences in
   angular momentum between walking conditions. These results provide a
   baseline for comparison to impaired populations that have difficulty
   maintaining dynamic balance, particularly during stair ascent and
   descent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy in the molecular fingerprint region
   is widely used for chemical identification and quantitative analysis
   employing infrared absorption spectra databases. The ability to perform
   mid-infrared spectroscopy with nanometre spatial resolution is highly
   desirable for applications in materials and life sciences. At present,
   scattering near-field scanning optical microscopy(1-6) is considered to
   be the most sensitive technique for nanoscale mid-infrared spectroscopy
   under ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate that nanoscale
   mid-infrared spectra can be obtained with comparable or higher
   sensitivity by detecting mechanical forces exerted by molecules on the
   atomic force microscope tip on light excitation. The mechanical approach
   to mid-infrared nanospectroscopy results in a simple optical set-up
   that, unlike scattering near-field scanning optical microscopy, requires
   no cryogenically cooled mid-infrared detectors, is easy to align, and is
   not affected by sample scattering.}},

Abstract = {{Spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging is an emerging biomedical
   imaging modality which can be used to simultaneously identify multiple
   optical absorbers in tissue. With current technology, the image
   acquisition time is limited primarily by the laser repetition rate, and
   sPA image acquisition can take seconds to minutes, depending on the
   system and imaging volume. We have developed an algorithm that can be
   used to eliminate extraneous wavelengths and decrease image acquisition
   time while maintaining image quality. Here, we show the effect the
   wavelength selection has on in vivo sPA imaging. As an example, dye
   draining to the lymph node of a mouse was imaged. We demonstrate that
   sPA image quality is more accurately preserved when wavelengths are
   chosen based on the spectral features of the absorbers compared to
   often- used selection of evenly spaced wavelengths. In fact, only three
   wavelengths are needed to accurately spectrally unmix the dye from
   oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{The reference rock site condition has two important applications for
   ground-motion prediction in the stable continental region of central and
   eastern North America (CENA). (1) It represents the site condition for
   which ground motions are computed using semiempirical ground-motion
   prediction equations. In addition, (2) it represents the site condition
   to which site amplification factors, which are used to modify
   ground-motion intensity measures for softer site condition, are
   referenced (i. e., site amplification is unity for reference rock). We
   define reference rock by its shear (S)and compression (P)-wave
   velocities, as well as a site attenuation parameter (kappa(0)), which is
   used in stochastic ground-motion simulation methods. Prior definitions
   of reference rock conditions in CENA were based mostly on indirect
   large-scale crustal velocity inversions and judgment. We compile and
   interpret a unique database of direct velocity measurements to develop
   criteria for assessing the presence of reference rock site condition
   based on measured seismic velocities and their gradient with respect to
   depth. We apply the criteria to available profiles and perform rigorous
   statistical analysis from which we recommend S-and P-wave velocities of
   3000 and 5500 m/s, respectively, for the reference rock condition. We
   recommend that, for practical applications, use ranges of reference
   S-and P-wave velocities of 2700-3300 m/s and 5000-6100 m/s,
   respectively. The ranges are based on a +/- 5\% change in amplification
   using quarterwavelength theory. We do not find evidence for regional
   dependence of the reference velocities, which are derived principally
   from three general geographic regions: (1) Atlantic coast, (2)
   continental interior, and (3) Appalachian Mountains. Our data do not
   provide reference velocities for the Gulf Coast region. The recommended
   velocity-compatible reference rock site kappa is 0.006 s.}},

Abstract = {{A weakly singular symmetric Galerkin boundary element method (SGBEM) is
   developed for analysis of fractures in two-dimensional multi-field
   media. Specialization for the cases of anisotropic linear elasticity,
   piezoelectricity and magnetoelectroelasticity is considered. The basis
   for the method is a pair of weak-form integral equations for
   `generalized' displacement and traction that involve only (at most)
   weakly singular kernels of order In r. Standard C degrees elements are
   employed everywhere except at the crack tips. A special crack-tip
   element is developed to properly model the asymptotic behavior of the
   relative crack-face displacements. Extra degrees of freedom at the tip
   node are incorporated in the crack-tip element so that the `generalized'
   stress intensity factors are directly obtained from the solution to the
   system of discretized equations. Various examples for cracks in both
   infinite and finite domains are examined. Highly accurate results are
   obtained with relatively coarse meshes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3752-3759}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{We study the effect of pH-dependent adsorption and hydrodynamic
   dispersion on cation transport through a reactive porous medium with a
   hydrophilic surface. We investigate how competitive adsorption between a
   proton and a metal (which in some situations of practical interest may
   also be a radionuclide) can facilitate the migration of a certain
   fraction of the latter. We performed laboratory experiments using a
   chromatographic column filled with silica beads coated with iron oxide
   and flooded initially with an acidic solution (pH approximate to 3) and
   then with an alkaline solution (pH > 7) containing either sodium,
   potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, or barium. The composition of
   each injected solution was chosen to represent one of two possible
   theoretical predictions, either a retarded shock and a fast pulse, that
   is, traveling at the interstitial fluid velocity, or only a retarded
   shock. Highly resolved breakthrough curves measured with inline ion
   chromatography allowed us to observe in all cases agreement with
   theoretical predictions, including numerous observations of a fast
   pulse. The fast pulse is the result of the interaction between
   pH-dependent adsorption and hydrodynamic dispersion and has previously
   been observed in systems with strontium. Here, we show the fast pulse
   arises also in the case of other cations allowing a generalization of
   the physical mechanism underlying this phenomenon and consideration of
   it as a new fast transport behavior. A one-dimensional reactive
   transport model for an incompressible fluid was developed combining
   surface complexation with mass conservation equations for a solute and
   the acidity (difference between the total proton and hydroxide
   concentration). In all cases, the model agrees with the measurements
   capturing the underlying physics of the overall transport behavior. Our
   results suggest that the interplay between pH-dependent adsorption and
   hydrodynamic dispersion can give rise to the rapid migration of metals
   through reactive porous media with potential effects on, for example,
   the performance of subsurface engineering infrastructures for pollutant
   containment, the mobilization of metal contaminants by brine acidified
   upon contact with CO2 during geologic carbon storage, and the
   chromatographic separation processes in industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptive immune system confers protection by generating a diverse
   repertoire of antibody receptors that are rapidly expanded and
   contracted in response to specific targets. Next-generation DNA
   sequencing now provides the opportunity to survey this complex and vast
   repertoire. In the present work, we describe a set of tools for the
   analysis of antibody repertoires and their application to elucidating
   the dynamics of the response to viral vaccination in human volunteers.
   By analyzing data from 38 separate blood samples across 2 y, we found
   that the use of the germ-line library of V and J segments is conserved
   between individuals over time. Surprisingly, there appeared to be no
   correlation between the use level of a particular VJ combination and
   degree of expansion. We found the antibody RNA repertoire in each
   volunteer to be highly dynamic, with each individual displaying
   qualitatively different response dynamics. By using combinatorial phage
   display, we screened selected VH genes paired with their corresponding
   VL library for affinity against the vaccine antigens. Altogether, this
   work presents an additional set of tools for profiling the human
   antibody repertoire and demonstrates characterization of the fast
   repertoire dynamics through time in multiple individuals responding to
   an immune challenge.}},

Title = {{A perspective on the high-voltage LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel cathode for
   lithium-ion batteries}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel is an attractive cathode candidate for next
   generation lithium-ion batteries as it offers high power capability with
   an operating voltage of similar to 4.7 V and a capacity of similar to
   135 mA h g(-1). However, its commercialization is plagued by severe
   capacity fade, particularly at elevated temperatures, in full cells
   employing a graphite anode. This perspective article provides an
   overview of the recent developments on understanding various factors
   that influence the electrochemical performance of the high-voltage
   spinel cathodes. The factors include the degree of cation ordering, Mn3+
   content, morphology, and surface planes/compositions in contact with the
   electrolyte, which are influenced by synthesis and annealing conditions
   as well as cation doping. For example, samples with a \{111\} family of
   surface planes show superior performance. Recent magnetic measurements
   and examination of discharge profiles below 3 V have become valuable to
   get a more precise measure of the degree of cation ordering. Also,
   surface modifications and electrolyte additives have shown marginal
   gains. Although acceptable performances have been obtained in half-cells
   with a metallic lithium anode, capacity fade is seen in full cells with
   a graphite anode due to metal dissolution at the high operating voltage
   of 4.7 V and Li+ consumption by the steadily forming solid-electrolyte
   interphase (SEI) layer promoted by Mn/Ni deposition on the graphite
   surface. Based on the current understanding, future directions are
   pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{The computation of the sparse principal component of a matrix is
   equivalent to the identification of its principal submatrix with the
   largest maximum eigenvalue. Finding this optimal submatrix is what
   renders the problem NP-hard. In this paper, we prove that, if the matrix
   is positive semidefinite and its rank is constant, then its sparse
   principal component is polynomially computable. Our proof utilizes the
   auxiliary unit vector technique that has been recently developed to
   identify problems that are polynomially solvable. In addition, we use
   this technique to design an algorithm which, for any sparsity value,
   computes the sparse principal component with complexity O(ND+1), where N
   and D are the matrix size and rank, respectively. Our algorithm is fully
   parallelizable and memory efficient.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Warping restraining devices can result in substantial improvements in
   the girder elastic buckling capacity; however, calculating this increase
   can be complex. This paper presents a simplified method to evaluate the
   increase in elastic buckling strength and corresponding unbraced length
   due to improved warping restraint provided by split pipe stiffeners
   located at the ends of doubly symmetric W-shapes. The solution is based
   on analytical studies and results from a finite-element parametric study
   validated using large-scale laboratory tests. The laboratory tests
   include specimens exposed to concentrated loads with split pipe
   warp-restraining devices and others with standard plate stiffeners. The
   proposed analytic method is based on uniform moment and shows that
   warping restraint can increase the elastic buckling capacity of a girder
   by 30-100\%. The improved warping stiffness can result in increases in
   the unbraced length in the range of 20-35\% compared with systems with

Journal = {{OCEAN MODELLING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{43-58}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Coastal ocean models play a major role in forecasting coastal inundation
   due to extreme events such as hurricanes and tsunamis. Additionally,
   they are used to model tides and currents under more moderate
   conditions. The models numerically solve the shallow water equations,
   which describe conservation of mass and momentum for processes with
   large horizontal length scales relative to the vertical length scales.
   The bottom stress terms that arise in the momentum equations can be
   defined through the Manning's n formulation, utilizing the Manning's n
   coefficient. The Manning's n coefficient is an empirically derived,
   spatially varying parameter, and depends on many factors such as the
   bottom surface roughness. It is critical to the accuracy of coastal
   ocean models, however, the coefficient is often unknown or highly
   uncertain. In this work we reformulate a statistical data assimilation
   method generally used in the estimation of model state variables to
   estimate this model parameter. We show that low-dimensional
   representations of Manning's n coefficients can be recovered by
   assimilating water elevation data. This is a promising approach to
   parameter estimation in coastal ocean modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{An augmented-Lagrangian method for the phase-field approach for
   pressurized fractures}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{271}},
Pages = {{69-85}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{In the modeling of pressurized fractures using phase-field approaches,
   the irreversibility of crack growth is enforced through an inequality
   constraint on the temporal derivative of the phase-field function. In
   comparison to the classical case in elasticity, the presence of the
   pressure requires the additional constraint and makes the problem much
   harder to analyze. After temporal discretization, this induces a
   minimization problem in each time step over a solution dependent
   admissible set. To avoid solving the resulting variational inequality
   corresponding to the first order necessary conditions, a penalization
   approach is used, commonly, to remove the inequality constraint. It is
   well-known that for large penalty parameters the algorithm suffers from
   numerical instabilities in the solution process. Consequently, to avoid
   such a drawback, we propose an augmented Lagrangian algorithm for the
   discrete in time and continuous in space phase-field problems. The final
   set of equations is solved in a decoupled fashion. The proposed method
   is substantiated with several benchmark and prototype tests in two and
   three dimensions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{330-343}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Solar Community Organizations (SCOs) are formal or informal
   organizations and citizen groups that help to reduce the barriers to the
   adoption of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) by (1) providing access
   to credible and transparent information about the localized benefits of
   residential PV and (2) actively campaigning to encourage adoption within
   their operational boundaries. We study the peer effect, or social
   interaction, process catalyzed by SCOs to understand the impact of these
   organizations on the residential PV market. Using a standardized search
   methodology across spatial scales (state; city; neighborhoods), we
   identify and characterize the operations of 228 SCOs formed in the U.S.
   between 1970 and 2012. We also present case studies of four successful
   SCOs and find that a common thread of why these SCOs are successful
   involves effectively leveraging trusted community networks combined with
   putting together a complete information and financial-tools package for
   use by interested communities. Finally, our findings suggest that
   empirical studies that attempt statistical identification and estimation
   of peer effects should pay close attention to the role of SCOs, as the
   social interactions engendered by SCOs may be correlated both with the
   level of social learning and the socio-demographic characteristics of
   the communities of interest. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate stereoscopic perception of

   Review Board exempt study, craniocaudal breast tomosynthesis cases (N =
   47), consisting of 23 biopsy-proven malignant mass cases and 24 normal
   cases, were retrospectively reviewed. A stereoscopic pair comprised of
   two projection images that were +/- 4A degrees apart from the zero angle
   projection was displayed on a Planar PL2010M stereoscopic display
   (Planar Systems, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA). An experienced breast imager
   verified the truth for each case stereoscopically. A two-phase blinded
   observer study was conducted. In the first phase, two experienced breast
   imagers rated their ability to perceive 3D information using a scale of
   1-3 and described the most suspicious lesion using the BI-RADSA (R)
   descriptors. In the second phase, four experienced breast imagers were
   asked to make a binary decision on whether they saw a mass for which
   they would initiate a diagnostic workup or not and also report the
   location of the mass and provide a confidence score in the range of
   0-100. The sensitivity and the specificity of the lesion detection task
   were evaluated. The results from our study suggest that radiologists who
   can perceive stereo can reliably interpret breast tomosynthesis
   projection images using stereoscopic viewing.}},

   grouting. While the groutability criteria based on the relative grain
   size of the soil and the grout have been widely used for particulate
   grouts, such criteria do not account for the change in groutability of
   soils due to chemical modifications of the grouts. Moreover, the
   bentonite grout has different physicochemical properties such as
   particle size and pH from those in the cement-based grout, resulting in
   different filtration character, and thus different groutability of
   soils. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the existing criteria
   developed for the cement-based grout to the bentonite grout. In this
   study, the apparent viscosities of various bentonite grouts (5, 7.5, 10,
   and 12 \%, wt/wt \%) with 0-4 \% SPP were measured using an advanced
   rheometer. The grouts were injected through sand columns having
   different effective particle sizes (0.2, 0.28, and 0.31 mm) under two
   constant pressures (35 and 140 kPa). A 1D filtration model was utilized
   to simulate the grout flow through the sand columns. A lumped parameter
   that accounts for physicochemical properties of bentonite grouts was
   evaluated by calibrating the model with the experimental data. The
   results showed that the apparent viscosity of 7.5, 10, and 12 \%
   bentonite suspensions decreased approximately 50 \% with the SPP
   concentrations of 1, 3, and 4 \%, respectively. Moreover, the lumped
   parameter increased with the decrease in the effective grain size of the
   sand and decreased with the decrease in the apparent viscosity of the
   grout. This implies that filtration during the grout flow was reduced
   with the SPP modification. The parameter also decreased with the
   increase in injection pressure and relative density. A new groutability
   criterion for bentonite grout was proposed based on the relationship
   between the injected pore volume and the lumped parameter. The criterion
   was compared to the existing criteria, leading to more accurate
   prediction of groutability in the tested sands. The proposed
   groutability criterion will be beneficial to design grouting works by
   more accurately predicting the groutability of granular soils for SPP
   modified bentonite grouts than the existing criteria.}},

Abstract = {{A blister test and associated analysis was developed to characterize the
   interfacial adhesion between graphene and substrates to which it has
   been transferred. In this study, chemical vapor deposition grown
   graphene had been transferred to a highly polished copper substrate from
   its seed foil. The graphene/photoresist composite film was pressurized
   with deionized water through a nominally 1-mm hole in the copper and the
   deflection of the membrane was measured by a full field interference
   method. The deflection profiles compared well with those obtained from a
   linear plate model that accounted for the initial strain in the membrane
   and a relaxed boundary condition at the edge of the blister. This was
   used to calculate the energy release rate as a function of delamination
   growth to obtain fracture resistance curves for the graphene/copper
   interface. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
   measurements of fracture resistance curves for adhesive interactions
   between transferred graphene and a copper substrate. The delamination
   path of the graphene/photoresist sample was confirmed by Raman
   spectroscopy. The measured adhesion energy for the graphene/copper
   interface was higher than that of a photoresist/ copper interface, but
   slightly lower than previous measurements for as-grown graphene on
   copper foil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal radiation transfer in one-dimensional parallel plates and
   two-dimensional rectangle enclosures filled with non-gray gases, namely
   CO2, H2O, or their mixtures, is calculated using the spectral
   collocation method with full spectrum k-distribution model (SCM-FSK).
   The k-distribution model is a promising model for treating the spectral
   properties of an absorbing-emitting medium, representing an alternative
   to line-by-line calculations which reduces the number of radiative
   transfer equation (RTE) evaluations from the order of a million to the
   order of ten without any significant loss of accuracy. Moreover, the
   full spectrum k-distribution model, as a global model, can be easily
   combined with other numerical methods to solve the RTE. The spectral
   collocation method (SCM) which is used to solve partial differential
   equations is combined with FSK for the present problems. In order to
   test the accuracy and efficiency of SCM-FSK, several gas radiation
   transfer problems involving isothermal/non-isothermal and
   homogeneous/inhomogeneous non-gray gases are examined. The results
   obtained by SCM-FSK are assessed by comparing the predictions with line
   by line results. These comparisons indicate that SCM-FSK is sufficiently
   accurate and convenient for engineering calculations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Analysis of Crash Data Using Quantile Regression for Counts}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Statistical models that describe the relationship between crash
   frequency and its influencing factors have been widely studied for the
   last three decades. Most of the existing methodologies use these models
   with count data and their variants to study the mean effects of
   covariates on crash frequency. This study seeks to explore the use of
   quantile regression for counts as a methodological alternative in
   analyzing crash frequency. Compared with existing models, the proposed
   model provides a fuller and more robust analysis of crash data for at
   least two reasons. First, crash data usually follow typical count
   distributions with a large proportion of zeros, and the remaining values
   highly skew toward the right. This nature of crash data makes quantile
   regression appealing because it can provide more comprehensive
   information about the effects of covariates on crash frequency rather
   than just the mean because quantile regression allows various quantiles
   of a population to be estimated. Second, as a semiparametric technique,
   quantile regression for counts allows researchers to relax restrictions
   in the form of the distribution function of the response variable,
   resulting in more robust estimation. In addition, two prediction methods
   are proposed to take advantage of such analysis results to yield better
   point prediction. To illustrate the application of quantile regression,
   crash data for interstate highways in urban areas in Washington State in
   2002 were extracted from the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS)
   and analyzed with the proposed model. The analysis results and
   prediction performance were then compared with those from the negative
   binomial regression model. The numerical case study shows that although
   the significance and signs of the effects derived from both models are
   consistent, the proposed quantile regression model reveals more detailed
   information on the marginal effects of covariates change across the
   conditional distribution of the response variable and provides more
   robust and accurate predictions on crash counts.}},

Abstract = {{A novel fabrication process of small pore-size nickel foams has been
   developed using electroless plating of solid-state foamed immiscible
   polymer blends. Ethylene acrylic acid (EAA) and polystyrene (PS) were
   melt-blended with extrusion to obtain a dual phase cocontinuous
   morphology. Gas saturation and foaming studies were performed to
   determine appropriate process conditions for foaming of the two-phase
   material. Open-celled polymer templates were obtained by extracting the
   PS phase with dichloromethane (DCM). The templates were subsequently
   used for nickel foam plating in ethanol-based electroless plating
   solutions. Nickel foams with pore sizes on the level of tens of
   micrometers and porosity above 90\% were fabricated. It was found that
   gas concentration and foaming temperature were major process variables
   significantly affecting the foam porosity. Foaming allowed faster PS
   extraction and higher porosity of the nickel plating templates. Because
   of the small pore size, ethanol-based solutions need to be used to
   ensure the infiltration of plating solutions. The developed process is a
   bulk method and can be used for large-scale fabrication of small
   pore-size nickel foams with high porosity.}},

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A finite element analysis of quasi-static, steady-state crack growth in
   pseudoelastic shape memory alloys is carried out for plane strain, mode
   I loading. The crack is assumed to propagate at a critical level of the
   crack-tip energy release rate. Results pertaining to the influence of
   forward and reverse phase transformation on the near-tip mechanical
   fields and fracture toughness are presented for a range of
   thermomechanical parameters and temperature. The fracture toughness is
   obtained as the ratio of the far-field applied energy release rate to
   the crack-tip energy release rate. A substantial fracture toughening is
   observed, in accordance with experimental observations, associated with
   the energy dissipated by the transformed material in the wake of the
   growing crack. Reverse phase transformation, being a dissipative process
   itself, is found to increase the levels of toughness enhancement.
   However, higher nominal temperatures tend to reduce the toughening of an
   SMA alloy-although the material's tendency to reverse transform in the
   wake of the advancing crack tip increases-due to the higher stress
   levels required for initiation of forward transformation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new model and solution methodology for the problem
   faced by companies that provide rehabilitative services to clinic and
   home-bound patients. Given a set of multi-skilled therapists and a group
   of geographically dispersed patients, the objective is to construct
   weekly tours for the therapists that minimize the travel, treatment, and
   administrative costs while ensuring that all patients are seen within
   their time windows and that a host of labor laws and contractual
   agreements are observed. The problem is complicated by three factors
   that prevent a daily decomposition: (i) overtime rates kick in only
   after 40 regular hours are worked during the week, (ii) new patients
   must be seen by a licensed therapist on their first visit, and (iii) for
   some patients only the frequency and not the actual days on which they
   are to be seen is specified. The problem is formulated as a
   mixed-integer linear program but after repeated attempts to solve small
   instances with commercial software failed, we developed an adaptive
   sequential greedy randomized adaptive search procedure. The phase I
   logic of the procedure builds one daily schedule at a time for each
   therapist until all patients are routed. In phase II, several
   neighborhoods are explored to arrive at a local optimum. Extensive
   testing with both real data provided by a U.S. rehab company and
   datasets derived from them demonstrated the value of the purposed
   procedure with respect to current practice. The results indicated that
   cost reductions averaging over 18.09 \% are possible.}},

   include the point of interest, a high order function value can be
   reconstructed using only positive linear weights. The re-averaging
   technique is applied to define two variants of a classic CWENO3 scheme
   that combines two linear polynomials to obtain formal third order
   accuracy. Such a scheme cannot otherwise be defined, due to the
   nonexistence of linear weights for third order reconstruction at the
   center of a grid element. The new scheme uses a compact stencil of three
   solution averages, and only positive linear weights are used. The scheme
   extends easily to problems in higher space dimensions, essentially as a
   tensor product of the one-dimensional scheme. The scheme maintains
   formal third order accuracy in higher dimensions. Numerical results show
   that this CWENO3 scheme is third order accurate for smooth problems and
   gives good results for non-smooth problems, including those with shocks.

Abstract = {{A strong adhesion force between resist and underlayer materials was
   employed to reduce resist pattern peeling generated from de-molding in

   surface with fluorinated surfactants. The reduction in resist pattern
   peeling by the interaction between the fluorinated SiO2 resist with
   epoxy groups and UV reactive underlayer materials with epoxy groups
   during UV irradiation was investigated. An optimized resist material
   formulation and high adhesion strength between resist and underlayer
   materials led to the well-patterned 80 nm resist lines on an underlayer
   for 100 imprints. The underlayer material was modified by a thermal
   crosslinking reaction of the aminoplast at 130 degrees C before
   nanoimprinting and, in conjunction with a cationic epoxy chemical
   reaction between the resist and the underlayer during UV irradiation
   before de-molding, proved to be quite effective for SFIL defect
   reduction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1375-1383}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{The surfaces of polysulfone and polyethersulfone ultrafiltration
   membranes were coated with polydopamine, yielding hydrophilic membranes
   that, under constant transmembrane pressure fouling conditions, have
   previously shown enhanced flux relative to unmodified membranes. When
   evaluated under constant permeate flux fouling, however, modified
   membranes exhibited higher transmembrane pressures than their unmodified
   analogs. This increased transmembrane pressure in the coated membranes
   was ascribed to the decrease in membrane permeance resulting from
   applying the polydopamine coating. The membrane permeance could be tuned
   by varying polydopamine deposition time and, even at the shortest
   deposition times studied here, a few minutes, a substantial increase in
   membrane hydrophilicity could be achieved. Therefore, polydopamine was
   deposited on a membrane of relatively high permeance until the pure
   water permeance of the modified membrane matched that of a membrane
   having lower native permeance, permitting a comparison of the fouling
   performance of a modified and unmodified membrane with the same pure
   water permeance. This approach was repeated, using a single, high
   permeance membrane as the base membrane for modification, to produce a
   family of modified membranes having the same initial pure water
   permeances as lower permeance, unmodified membranes. When unmodified and
   modified membranes of the same initial permeance were compared at
   constant flux fouling conditions, the modified membranes consistently
   exhibited lower transmembrane pressures and similar organic rejections
   to the unmodified membranes. Because many porous water purification
   membranes are operated at constant flux in industrial settings, an
   interesting methodology for membrane surface modification may be to
   surface-modify a membrane of high permeance until the desired permeance
   is achieved, rather than by surface modification of a membrane that
   natively has the desired water transport characteristics, since the
   surface modification procedures almost invariably lead to lower pure
   water permeance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) (BPS) random copolymers,
   prepared from a sulfonated monomer, have been considered for use as
   membrane materials for various applications in water purification and
   power generation. These membranes can be melt-processed to avoid the use
   of hazardous solvent-based processes with the aid of a plasticizer, a
   low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). PEG was used to modify
   the glass transition temperature and melt rheology of BPS to enable
   coextrusion with polypropylene (PP). Our previous paper discussed the
   miscibility of BPS with PEG and the influence of PEG on the glass
   transition of BPS. In this study, the rheological properties of
   disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)s plasticized with poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG) are investigated to identify coextrusion processing
   conditions with candidate PPs. The effects of various factors including
   PEG molecular weight, PEG concentration, temperature and BPS molecular
   weight on blend viscosity were studied. The rheological data effectively
   lie on the same master curve developed by Bueche and Harding for
   non-associating polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and
   polystyrene (PS). Although sulfonated polysulfone contains ionic groups,
   the form of its viscosity versus shear rate (or frequency) behavior
   appears to be dominated by the relaxation of polymer entanglements. (c)

   atmospheric entry of large vehicles with an ablative thermal protection
   system. The Favre-averaged thermochemical nonequilibrium Navier Stokes
   equations with Spalart Allmaras turbulence closure, thermodynamic,

   numerical method is based on a streamline upwind Petrov Galerkin (SUPG)
   stabilized finite element formulation. The formulation and
   implementation of the finite element approximation are discussed in
   detail. The performance of the scheme is investigated through a series
   of increasingly complex applications, culminating in the simulation of a

Title = {{Differences in the composition of the human antibody repertoire by B
   cell subsets in the blood}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{at The vast initial diversity of the antibody repertoire is generated
   centrally by means of a complex series of V(D)J gene rearrangement
   events, variation in the site of gene segment joining, and TdT catalyzed
   N-region addition. Although the diversity is great, close inspection has
   revealed distinct and unique characteristics in the antibody repertoires
   expressed by different B cell developmental subsets. In order to
   illustrate our approach to repertoire analysis, we present an in-depth
   comparison of V(D)J gene usage, hydrophobicity, length, D-H reading
   frame, and amino acid usage between heavy chain repertoires expressed by
   immature, transitional, mature, memory IgD+, memory IgD-, and
   plasmacytes isolated from the blood of a single individual. Our results
   support the view that in both human and mouse, the H chain repertoires
   expressed by individual, developmental B cell subsets appear to differ
   in sequence content. Sequencing of unsorted B cells from the blood is
   thus likely to yield an incomplete or compressed view of what is
   actually happening in the immune response of the individual. Our
   findings support the view that studies designed to correlate repertoire
   expression with diseases of immune function will likely require deep
   sequencing of B cells sorted by subset.}},

Abstract = {{Infants spend most of their time sleeping and are likely to be exposed
   to elevated concentrations of chemicals released from their crib
   mattresses. Small-scale chamber experiments were conducted to determine
   the area-specific emission rates (SERs) of volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs) in a collection of twenty new and used crib mattresses. All
   mattress samples were found to emit VOCs and the mean values of total
   VOC (TVOC) SERs were 56 mu g/m(2)h at 23 degrees C and 139 mu g/m(2)h at
   36 degrees C. TVOC SERs were greater for new Mattresses compared to used
   ones and were influenced by the type of foam material and the presence
   of mattress cover layer. A variety of VOCs were identified, with
   polyurethane foam releasing a greater diversity of VOCs compared to
   polyester foam. Large-scale chamber experiments were conducted with an
   infant thermal manikin. TVOC concentrations sampled in the breathing
   zone and interior pore air of the crib mattress foam were found to be
   greater than the bulk room air by factors in the range of 1.8 to 2.4 and
   7.5 to 21, respectively. The results suggest that crib mattresses are an
   important source of VOCs and infant exposure to VOCs are possibly
   elevated in their sleep microenvironments.}},

Title = {{Model Studies Studies with Gold: A Versatile Oxidation and Hydrogenation
   Catalyst}},

Abstract = {{Historically, scientists have considered gold an inert catalyst
   constituent However, in recent decades, chemists have discovered that
   nanoscale gold shows exceptional activity for many chemical reactions.
   They have investigated model gold surfaces in order to obtain
   fundamental understanding of catalytic properties. In this Account, we
   present our current understanding of oxidation and hydrogenation
   reactions on the Au(111) single crystal as a planar representative of
   gold catalysts, revealing the interesting surface chemistry of gold.
   We begin by comparing two inverse reactions, alcohol oxidation and
   aldehyde hydrogenation, on a Au(111) surface. Beyond the expected
   different chemistry, we observe intriguing similarities since the same
   surface is employed. First, both molecular oxygen and hydrogen have high
   barriers to dissociation on Au(111), and frequently chemists study
   reactions here by using atomic 0 and H to populate the surfaces.
   Recombinative desorption features of oxygen and hydrogen are apparent at
   similar to 500 and similar to 110 K, lower than other transition metals.
   These results indicate that oxygen and hydrogen have low desorption
   activation energies and weakly chemisorb on the surface, likely leading
   to selective reactions. On the oxygen-precovered Au(111) surface,
   alcohols are selectively oxidized to aldehydes. Similarly, weakly bound
   hydrogen atoms on Au(111) also show chemoselective reactivity for
   hydrogenation of propionaldehyde and acetone.
   The second similarity is that the gold surface activates self-coupling
   of alcohol or aldehyde with oxygen or hydrogen, resulting in the
   formation of esters and ethers, respectively, in alcohol oxidation and
   aldehyde hydrogenation. During these two reactions, both alkoxy groups
   and alcohol-like species show up as intermediates, which likely play a
   key role In the formation of coupling products. In addition, the cross
   coupling reaction between alcohol and aldehyde occurs on both O- and
   H-modified surfaces, yielding the production of esters and ethers,
   respectively. Thus, we can tune the molecular structure of both esters
   and ethers by selecting the corresponding aldehyde and alcohol for the
   coupling reaction.
   These studies indicate that gold is a versatile active catalyst for
   various reactions, including oxidation and hydrogenation
   transformations. Despite the very different chemistry for these two
   reactions, we can establish an intrinsic relationship due to the
   distinct catalytic properties of gold. It can show activity for
   selective reactions on both O-and H-covered Au(111) and further Induce
   the coupling reaction between surface reactants and adsorbed O/H to
   produce esters and ethers. This comparison demonstrates the unique
   surface chemistry of gold and enhances understanding of its catalytic
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and
   safety of uninterrupted rivaroxaban therapy during atrial fibrillation
   (AF) ablation.
   Background Optimal periprocedural anticoagulation strategy is essential
   for minimizing bleeding and thromboembolic complications during and
   after AF ablation. The safety and efficacy of uninterrupted rivaroxaban
   therapy as a periprocedural anticoagulant for AF ablation are unknown.
   Methods We performed a multicenter, observational, prospective study of
   a registry of patients undergoing AF ablation in 8 centers in North
   America. Patients taking uninterrupted periprocedural rivaroxaban were
   matched by age, sex, and type of AF with an equal number of patients
   taking uninterrupted warfarin therapy who were undergoing AF ablation
   during the same period.
   Results A total of 642 patients were included in the study, with 321 in
   each group. Mean age was 63 +/- 10 years, with 442 (69\%) males and 328
   (51\%) patients with paroxysmal AF equally distributed between the 2
   groups. Patients in the warfarin group had a slightly higher mean HAS-
   BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding
   history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio,
   elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly) score (1.70 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.47 +/-
   0.9, respectively; p = 0.032). Bleeding and embolic complications
   occurred in 47 (7.3\%) and 2 (0.3\%) patients (both had transient
   ischemic attacks) respectively. There were no differences in the number
   of major bleeding complications (5 {[}1.6\%] vs. 7 {[}1.9\%],
   respectively; p = 0.772), minor bleeding complications (16 {[}5.0\%] vs.
   19 {[}5.9\%], respectively; p = 0.602), or embolic complications (1
   {[}0.3\%] vs. 1 {[}0.3\%], respectively; p = 1.0) between the
   rivaroxaban and warfarin groups in the first 30 days.
   Conclusions Uninterrupted rivaroxaban therapy appears to be as safe and
   efficacious in preventing bleeding and thromboembolic events in patients
   undergoing AF ablation as uninterrupted warfarin therapy. (C) 2014 by

Title = {{A condition-specific codon optimization approach for improved
   heterologous gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Heterologous gene expression is an important tool for
   synthetic biology that enables metabolic engineering and the production
   of non-natural biologics in a variety of host organisms. The
   translational efficiency of heterologous genes can often be improved by
   optimizing synonymous codon usage to better match the host organism.
   However, traditional approaches for optimization neglect to take into
   account many factors known to influence synonymous codon distributions.
   Results: Here we define an alternative approach for codon optimization
   that utilizes systems level information and codon context for the
   condition under which heterologous genes are being expressed.
   Furthermore, we utilize a probabilistic algorithm to generate multiple
   variants of a given gene. We demonstrate improved translational
   efficiency using this condition-specific codon optimization approach
   with two heterologous genes, the fluorescent protein-encoding eGFP and
   the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene CatA, expressed in S. cerevisiae. For
   the latter case, optimization for stationary phase production resulted
   in nearly 2.9-fold improvements over commercial gene optimization
   algorithms.
   Conclusions: Codon optimization is now often a standard tool for protein
   expression, and while a variety of tools and approaches have been
   developed, they do not guarantee improved performance for all hosts of
   applications. Here, we suggest an alternative method for
   condition-specific codon optimization and demonstrate its utility in
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a proof of concept. However, this technique
   should be applicable to any organism for which gene expression data can
   be generated and is thus of potential interest for a variety of
   applications in metabolic and cellular engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Contact resistance (R-c) can substantially obscure the extracted
   mobility based on standard transconductance or two-point conductance
   measurements of field-effect devices especially for low density of
   states materials such as MoS2 or similar atomic crystals. Currently,
   there exists a pressing need for a routine technique that can decouple
   mobility extraction from R-c. By combining experiments and analysis, we
   show that the Y-function method offers a robust route for evaluating the
   low-field mobility, threshold voltage and R-c even when the contact is a
   Schottky-barrier as is common in two-dimensional transistors. In
   addition, an independent modified transfer length method evaluation
   corroborates the Y-function analysis. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Comparison of membrane fouling at constant flux and constant
   transmembrane pressure conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{454}},
Pages = {{505-515}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Membrane fouling is often characterized in the laboratory by flux
   decline experiments, where an increase in transport resistance due to
   accumulation of foulants on and/or in a membrane is manifested as a
   decrease in permeate flux with filtration time at fixed transmembrane
   pressure. However, many industrial microfiltration and ultrafiltration
   applications operate at constant permeate flux, and there are Few
   reports comparing these modes of operation. In this study, emulsified
   oil fouling of polysullone ultrafiltration membranes was studied using
   both constant permeate flux and constant transmembrane pressure
   experiments. Mass transfer resistance changes during fouling were
   compared between constant Flux experiments and constant transmembrane
   pressure experiments performed at an initial flux equal to the flux
   imposed during the constant flux experiment. At low fluxes, the
   transport resistance and its change with permeate volume per unit area
   agreed within experimental error regardless of operational mode. In
   contrast, at high fluxes, the change in membrane resistance with
   permeate volume per unit area was much higher in constant flux than in
   constant transmembrane pressure experiments. The threshold flux, defined
   recently as the flux at which the rate of fouling begins to increase
   rapidly, separates the regimes of good and poor agreement between the
   two types of experiments. The weak form of the critical flux, below
   which spontaneous adsorption is the only significant resistance imposed
   by foulant, was also observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Surface complexation modeling of Hg(II) adsorption at the goethite/water
   interface using the Charge Distribution Multi-Site Complexation
   (CD-MUSIC) model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{418}},
Pages = {{147-161}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Previous attempts to describe Hg(II) adsorption onto mineral
   surfaces using surface complexation models (SCMs) have proven
   unsuccessful and/or require the use of hypothetical surface species.
   Given that metal ion adsorption at the mineral-water interface is
   greatly influenced by mineral surface heterogeneity and the presence of
   competing adsorbates in solution, it stands to reason that estimating
   the crystal face composition (CFC) of the mineral surface and the extent
   of carbonate contamination in the experimental system will improve SCM
   predictions.
   Experiments: The Charge Distribution Multi-Site Complexation (CD-MUSIC)
   model was used to simulate experimental Hg(II) adsorption data,
   collected on the iron hydroxide mineral goethite, in the presence and
   absence of competing adsorbates and complexing ligands as a function of
   pH and ionic strength. The CFC of each goethite sample studied was
   predicted using a newly discovered relationship between goethite's
   proton reactive site density (N-H) and specific surface area (SSA).
   Carbonate's presence in the experimental systems was determined
   utilizing a novel methodology developed in this work.
   Findings: The CD-MUSIC model developed in this study accurately
   predicted Hg(II) adsorption onto goethite over the entire range of
   experimental conditions investigated while only employing surface
   species consistent with spectroscopic evidence. (C) 2014 Published by

Title = {{A peridynamic formulation of pressure driven convective fluid transport
   in porous media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{261}},
Pages = {{209-229}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{A general state-based peridynamic formulation is presented for
   convective single-phase flow of a liquid of small and constant
   compressibility in heterogeneous porous media. In addition to local
   fluid transport, possible anomalous diffusion due to non-local fluid
   transport is considered and simulated. The governing integral equations
   of the peridynamic formulation are computationally easier to solve in
   domains with discontinuities than the traditional conservation models
   containing spatial derivatives. A bond-based peridynamic formulation is
   also developed and demonstrated to be a special case of the state-based
   formulation. The non-local model does not assume continuity in the field
   variables, satisfies mass conservation over an arbitrary bounded body
   and approaches the corresponding local model as the non-local region
   goes to zero. The exact solution of the local model closely matches the
   non-local model for a classical two-dimensional flow problem with fluid
   sources and sinks and for both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary
   conditions. The model is shown to capture arbitrary flow
   discontinuities/heterogeneities without any fundamental changes to the
   model and with small incremental computational costs. Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{We propose a method for computing the activation barrier for chemical
   reactions involving molecules subjected to mechanical stress. The method
   avoids reactant and transition-state saddle optimizations at every force
   by, instead, solving the differential equations governing the force
   dependence of the critical points (i.e., minima and saddles) on the
   system's potential energy surface (PES). As a result, only zero-force
   geometry optimization (or, more generally, optimization performed at a
   single force value) is required by the method. In many cases, minima and
   transition-state saddles only exist within a range of forces and
   disappear beyond a certain critical point. Our method identifies such
   force-induced instabilities as points at which one of the Hessian
   eigenvalues vanishes. We elucidate the nature of those instabilities as
   fold and cusp catastrophes, where two or three critical points on the
   force-modified PES coalesce, and provide a classification of various
   physically distinct instability scenarios, each illustrated with a
   concrete chemical example. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Amine scrubbing is the most mature CO2 capture technology for fossil
   fuel power plants, but the energy use for CO2 regeneration and
   compression will be 20 to 25\% of the power plant output. The objective
   of this work is to develop alternative stripper configurations that
   reduce the energy use of CO2 capture. The advanced stripper
   configurations were modeled and optimized using Aspen Plus. Total
   equivalent work was used as an indicator of overall energy performance
   accounting for reboiler duty, compression work, and pump work. The rich
   exchanger bypass recovers stripping steam heat by using an exchanger. To
   get better energy performance, this strategy was applied to advanced
   configurations including a reboiler-based stripper, an interheated
   stripper, and a flash stripper. Both 9 m monoethanolamine (MEA) and 8 m
   piperazine (PZ) were investigated. The best energy performance was
   obtained from the stripper with a warm rich bypass and a rich exchanger
   bypass, which provides 10\% less equivalent work for PZ and 6\% less for
   MEA compared to the simple stripper. A flash stripper with a warm rich
   bypass and rich exchanger bypass uses 9\% less energy with PZ and 5\%
   less with MEA With the warm rich bypass and rich exchanger bypass, MEA
   can provide 8\% less equivalent work at 135 degrees C with acceptable
   thermal degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Localized surface plasmon resonance phenomena have recently been

   and chalcogenide semiconductors doped with high concentrations of free
   carriers. We synthesize colloidal nanocrystals of CsxWO3, a tungsten
   bronze in which electronic charge carriers are introduced by
   interstitial doping. By using varying ratios of oleylamine to oleic
   acid, we synthesize three distinct shapes of these nanocrystals
   hexagonal prisms, truncated cubes, and pseudospheres which exhibit
   strongly shape-dependent absorption features in the near-infrared
   region. We rationalize these differences by noting that lower symmetry
   shapes correlate with sharper plasmon resonance features and more
   distinct resonance peaks. The plasmon peak positions also shift
   systematically with size and with the dielectric constant of the
   surrounding media, reminiscent of typical properties of plasmonic metal
   nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Multilayered gas separation membranes with alternating layers of beta
   crystalline polypropylene and PEBAX copolymers were produced via
   coextrusion and biaxial stretching for potential applications in
   modified atmosphere packaging. The number of layers and PEBAX
   compositions were varied to study the effect of various membrane
   configurations on pore formation in the polypropylene layers, which
   ideally serve as a mechanical support for the selective PEBAX layers.
   Gas permeabilities of multilayered films were compared to control PEBAX
   films using a simple model, which allowed inferences about the
   completeness of pore formation to be drawn. Preliminary results show
   that increasing the layer count degrades membrane throughput and
   separation capability, while varying PEBAX composition results in a
   tradeoff between these properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Shale-gas production has gained worldwide attention over the past
   several years. Production from shale-gas reservoirs requires horizontal
   drilling with multiple hydraulic fracturing to obtain the most
   economical production. However, there are high cost and uncertainty
   because of many inestimable and uncertain parameters (e.g., reservoir
   permeability, porosity, fracture spacing, fracture half-length, fracture
   conductivity, gas desorption, geomechanics, and existing natural
   fractures). Therefore, the development of a way to quantify
   uncertainties and optimization of shale-gas production in an efficient
   and practical method is clearly desirable.
   In this paper, we present a user-friendly and efficient framework to
   obtain the optimal gas-production scenario by optimizing the uncertain
   factors by integrating several commercial simulators, an economic model,
   design of experiment (DoE), and response-surface methodology (RSM) with
   a global optimization search engine. Specifically, we use factorial
   design to screen insignificant factors and find the most influential
   design and uncertain factors; then, we use RSM to design over those most
   influential factors to fit a response surface using net present value
   (NPV) as the objective function; finally, we identify the most
   economical production scenario under conditions of uncertainty. Eight
   uncertain parameters {[}i.e., porosity, permeability, reservoir
   thickness, reservoir pressure, bottomhole pressure (BHP), fracture
   spacing, fracture half-length, and fracture conductivity] with a
   reasonable range on the basis of Barnett-shale information are
   investigated. Also, different gas prices are considered for the
   optimization process.
   This framework is effective and efficient for
   hydraulic-fracturing-treatment design and production-scheme optimization
   in unconventional gas reservoirs. It can contribute to providing
   guidance for engineers to modify the design of a hydraulic-fracture
   treatment before the actual fracture treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of proteins play an important role in their
   biological function. For example, microtubules carry large loads to
   transport organelles inside the cell, and virus shells undergo changes
   in shape and mechanical properties during maturation which affect their
   infectivity. Various theoretical models including continuum elasticity
   have been applied to study these structural properties, and a
   significant success has been achieved. But, the previous frameworks lack
   a connection between the atomic and continuum descriptions. Here this is
   accomplished through the development of a meshfree framework based on
   reproducing kernel shape functions for the large deformation mechanics
   of protein structures. The framework is validated by comparing thermal
   fluctuations of small proteins against well established elastic network
   model. To demonstrate the usability of this framework, solutions to
   several other problems are presented. The response of virus shells to
   indentation under atomic force microscope tip is simulated and compared
   to the finite element results. Finally, the large scale conformational
   changes of viruses are analyzed by computing the deformations/strains
   associated with the conformational motions. Excellent agreement with the
   previously published results is observed while increasing the efficiency
   of numerical analysis. Furthermore, the results provide insights into
   the continuum behavior of proteins and the optimum amount of geometric
   details necessary for calculating their mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to solve the minimum time rendezvous
   problem of multiple spacecraft using differential drag. The problem is
   to rendezvous any number of vehicles using only the relative aerodynamic
   drag between the vehicles. Each vehicle is equipped with drag plates
   that can be opened or closed, thus modulating the drag force acting on
   the vehicle. By actuating the drag plates, the aerodynamic drag becomes
   the control used to accomplish the rendezvous. The optimal control
   problem is relaxed to a convex problem, and it is proved that a solution
   of the relaxed problem exists that is also a solution of the original
   problem. This process is called lossless convexification, and it leads
   to a solution method based on solving a finite number of linear
   programming problems. This method offers guaranteed convergence to the
   global minimum in polynomial time and does not require an initial guess.
   Two examples are solved with two and five vehicles and the results are
   compared with existing technologies. Because the method is fast and
   globally convergent, it is well suited for real-time use onboard a
   vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{We present the concept and practical design of nonreciprocal optical

   compact optical isolators exhibiting arbitrarily large isolation and low
   transmission loss, achieved by properly selecting the quality factor of
   the nanoring, the amount of angular momentum bias, and the gaps between
   ring and channel/drop waveguides. A practical implementation based on
   stepwise modulation and pin junctions is explored, showing strong
   nonreciprocal response in a simple, integrated design. These findings

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{Carbon sequestration is a big environmental issue these days. For
   geologic sequestration of CO2 accurate and time-efficient estimation of
   phase equilibrium between CO2 and brine is an important concern. As we
   know any phase equilibrium or mutual solubility calculations require
   iterations in order to attain desired convergence in fugacity
   measurements from which equilibrium compositions are obtained. In this
   paper a fully non-iterative technique is proposed for calculating phase
   equilibrium compositions of CO2 in brine water and that of H2O in CO2
   rich phase for the temperature and pressures ranges of 20-40 degrees C,
   1-400 bar, respectively. Brine salinity is tested up to 4. molality. As
   an essential part of this computation process, an empirical volume
   explicit equation for CO2 having only 8 parameters is presented. The
   volumetric data and calculated results of phase compositions using this
   equation are compared with the literature values. They exhibit good
   agreement with less than 2\% deviation. A modified scheme of CO2+ brine
   density calculation is also shown. More so, computational efficiency
   following the non-iterative technique against using Equation of State
   (EoS) in reservoir simulation is compared. This shows that the proposed
   technique can be even more than 1000 times faster than conventional
   phase equilibrium computation after integrating with numerical
   simulation of CO2 flow in reservoir. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Oxygen Limitation within a Bacterial Aggregate}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Cells within biofilms exhibit physiological heterogeneity, in part
   because of chemical gradients existing within these spatially structured
   communities. Previous work has examined how chemical gradients develop
   in large biofilms containing >10(8) cells. However, many bacterial
   communities in nature are composed of small, densely packed aggregates
   of cells (<= 10(5) bacteria). Using a gelatin-based three-dimensional
   (3D) printing strategy, we confined the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   within picoliter-sized 3D ``microtraps{''} that are permeable to
   nutrients, waste products, and other bioactive small molecules. We show
   that as a single bacterium grows into a maximally dense (10(12) cells
   ml(-1)) clonal population, a localized depletion of oxygen develops when
   it reaches a critical aggregate size of similar to 55 pl. Collectively,
   these data demonstrate that chemical and phenotypic heterogeneity exists
   on the micrometer scale within small aggregate populations.
   IMPORTANCE Before developing into large, complex communities, microbes
   initially cluster into aggregates, and it is unclear if chemical
   heterogeneity exists in these ubiquitous micrometer-scale aggregates. We
   chose to examine oxygen availability within an aggregate since oxygen
   concentration impacts a number of important bacterial processes,
   including metabolism, social behaviors, virulence, and antibiotic
   resistance. By determining that oxygen availability can vary within
   aggregates containing <= 10(5) bacteria, we establish that physiological
   heterogeneity exists within P. aeruginosa aggregates, suggesting that
   such heterogeneity frequently exists in many naturally occurring small
   populations.}},

Title = {{Well permeability estimation and CO2 leakage rates}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{77-87}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The risk of leakage along existing wellbores associated with CO2
   sequestration depends strongly upon the leakage path permeabilities.
   Assuming the gas migration path through leaky wellbores in hydrocarbon
   reservoirs is analogous to the leakage path for CO2 plumes, the
   distribution of inferred permeabilities enables quantitative estimation
   of CO2 leakage rates. We estimate the effective permeabilities of about
   300 wellbores in six different fields that exhibit sustained casing
   pressure (SCP) or surface casing vent flow (SCVF). Uncertain parameters
   that affect the estimated permeability, such as the location of the leak
   source, are accounted for by a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, yielding
   an expected value of leakage path permeability for each measurement of
   SCP or SCVF. The expected permeabilities along most of the leaky
   wellbores are between 10 mu d and 10 md. We further use a data mining
   approach to seek correlations between the permeabilities and wellbore
   characteristics. Using the wellbore permeabilities to estimate the
   aperture of the leakage pathways, we estimate the capillary pressure and
   hence the minimum CO2 plume heights required for CO2 to enter the
   leakage paths. We compute worst-case steady CO2 leakage fluxes, finding
   that over 90\% of the fluxes are less than 0.1 ton/m(2)/yr, which are
   smaller than large persistent fluxes observed in nature. The majority of
   the leakage rates along the wellbores are less than 1 kg/yr, and the
   highest rates are less than 0.1 ton/yr. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Unlike discrete testing methods, the rolling dynamic deflectometer (RDD)
   performs continuous measurements. Thus, it is a powerful screening and
   evaluation tool for quickly characterizing large sections of highway and
   airfield pavements with little danger of missing critical pavement
   features. RDD testing applications have involved (1) pavement forensic
   investigations, (2) delineations of areas to be repaired, (3) selections
   of rehabilitation treatments, measurements of relative improvements due
   to the rehabilitation, and (4) monitoring of changes with time
   (trafficking and environmental loading). This paper discusses the
   efforts to improve the velocity of RDD testing up to 5 mph (8.0 km/h)
   while minimizing the accuracy and resolution of deflection data. The
   research consisted of the development of a velocity-improved rolling
   sensor and the field evaluation of its new sensor system. The velocity-
   improved rolling sensor and the enhanced data processing were tested in
   both flexible and rigid pavements at varied velocities. The enhanced RDD
   system potentially enabled testing velocities of up to 5 mph (8.0 km/h)
   in thin flexible pavements (i.e., farm-to-market roads) and up to 3 mph
   (4.8 km/h) in rigid pavements.}},

Title = {{A Mean-Risk Model for the Traffic Assignment Problem with Stochastic
   Travel Times}},
Journal = {{OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{366-382}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Heavy and uncertain traffic conditions exacerbate the commuting
   experience of millions of people across the globe. When planning
   important trips, commuters typically add an extra buffer to the expected
   trip duration to ensure on-time arrival. Motivated by this, we propose a
   new traffic assignment model that takes into account the stochastic
   nature of travel times. Our model extends the traditional model of
   Wardrop competition when uncertainty is present in the network. The
   focus is on strategic risk-averse users who capture the trade-off
   between travel times and their variability in a mean-standard deviation
   objective, defined as the mean travel time plus a risk-aversion factor
   times the standard deviation of travel time along a path. We consider
   both infinitesimal users, leading to a nonatomic game, and atomic users,
   leading to a discrete finite game.
   We establish conditions that characterize an equilibrium traffic
   assignment and find when it exists. The main challenge is posed by the
   users' risk aversion, since the mean-standard deviation objective is
   nonconvex and nonseparable, meaning that a path cannot be split as a sum
   of edge costs. As a result, even an individual user's subproblem-a
   stochastic shortest path problem-is a nonconvex optimization problem for
   which no polynomial time algorithms are known. In turn, the mathematical
   structure of the traffic assignment model with stochastic travel times
   is fundamentally different from the deterministic counterpart. In
   particular, an equilibrium characterization requires exponentially many
   variables, one for each path in the network, since an edge flow has
   multiple possible path-flow decompositions that are not equivalent.
   Because of this, characterizing the equilibrium and the socially optimal
   assignment, which minimizes the total user cost, is more challenging
   than in the traditional deterministic setting. Nevertheless, we prove
   that both can be encoded by a representation with just polynomially many
   paths.
   Finally, under the assumption that the standard deviations of travel
   times are independent from edge loads, we show that the worst-case ratio
   between the social cost of an equilibrium and that of an optimal
   solution is not higher than the analogous ratio in the deterministic
   setting. In other words, uncertainty does not further degrade the system
   performance in addition to strategic user behavior alone.}},

Title = {{A streamline splitting pore-network approach for computationally

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Several approaches have been developed in the literature for solving
   flow and transport at the pore scale. Some authors use a direct modeling
   approach where the fundamental flow and transport equations are solved
   on the actual pore-space geometry. Such direct modeling, while very
   accurate, comes at a great computational cost. Network models are
   computationally more efficient because the pore-space morphology is
   approximated. Typically, a mixed cell method (MCM) is employed for
   solving the flow and transport system which assumes pore-level perfect
   mixing. This assumption is invalid at moderate to high Peclet regimes.
   In this work, a novel Eulerian perspective on modeling flow and
   transport at the pore scale is developed. The new streamline splitting
   method (SSM) allows for circumventing the pore-level perfect-mixing
   assumption, while maintaining the computational efficiency of
   pore-network models. SSM was verified with direct simulations and
   validated against micromodel experiments; excellent matches were
   obtained across a wide range of pore-structure and fluid-flow
   parameters. The increase in the computational cost from MCM to SSM is
   shown to be minimal, while the accuracy of SSM is much higher than that
   of MCM and comparable to direct modeling approaches. Therefore, SSM can
   be regarded as an appropriate balance between incorporating detailed
   physics and controlling computational cost. The truly predictive
   capability of the model allows for the study of pore-level interactions
   of fluid flow and transport in different porous materials. In this
   paper, we apply SSM and MCM to study the effects of pore-level mixing on
   transverse dispersion in 3-D disordered granular media.

Abstract = {{Incorporation of thermally reduced graphene oxide (RG-O) into the metal
   oxide semiconductor BiVO4 improves its photoactivity by about three
   times for sulfite oxidation. The enhancement of photoactivity is
   attributed to reduced electron-hole recombination of BiVO4 using the
   RG-O as a conductive matrix in the composite photocatalyst.
   Photoelectrochemical behavior of the BiVO4 and RG-0/BiVO4 composite
   electrodes were simulated using finite element analysis to obtain the
   carrier mobility and its lifetime in the photoelectrodes. In contrast
   with sulfite oxidation, the improvement of photocurrent for water
   oxidation of RG-0/BiVO4 composite electrode was not significant because
   of the slower kinetics for water oxidation. To address the kinetic
   limitations, platinum (Pt) as an effective electrocatalyst was
   photodeposited on the RG-0/BiVO4 electrode. Addition of the Pt
   significantly improved water oxidation photocurrent of the Pt/RG-O/BiVO4
   electrode. RG-O/W-Mo-doped BiVO4 composite electrodes were also prepared
   to investigate a further enhancement of photoactivity of W-Mo-doped

Abstract = {{The shear-wave velocity and associated small-strain shear modulus of
   municipal solid waste (MSW) are important engineering parameters in
   evaluating the seismic response of MSW landfills as well as in
   characterizing the waste material and its response to static loads.
   Semiempirical and empirical models for the shear-wave velocity are
   presented. The semiempirical model is a more comprehensive model that
   aims to separately capture the effect of waste density and confining
   stress on the shear-wave velocity of MSW. It is based on similar models
   for soils, and its mathematical expression is formulated using data
   generated from large-scale laboratory studies on reconstituted MSW. The
   empirical model has a simpler mathematical expression that is a function
   of depth only. The parameters of both models are derived by calibrating
   them against a total of 49 in situ shear-wave velocity profiles at 19
   MSW landfills, i.e., 13 profiles from four landfills in Michigan
   generated as part of this study and 36 additional shear-wave velocity
   profiles from 15 landfills available in the literature. The models can
   be used to estimate the shear-wave velocity of MSW and to evaluate the
   seismic response of landfills. Also, in the absence of in situ data, the
   models can be used at existing MSW landfills for preliminary design
   purposes. The models are not intended to replace in situ data and do not
   predict abrupt changes in the shear-wave velocity profile as a result of
   abrupt changes in waste type and composition.}},

Title = {{Estimating uncertainties in statistics computed from direct numerical
   simulation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Rigorous assessment of uncertainty is crucial to the utility of direct
   numerical simulation (DNS) results. Uncertainties in the computed
   statistics arise from two sources: finite statistical sampling and the
   discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Due to the presence of
   non-trivial sampling error, standard techniques for estimating
   discretization error (such as Richardson extrapolation) fail or are
   unreliable. This work provides a systematic and unified approach for
   estimating these errors. First, a sampling error estimator that accounts
   for correlation in the input data is developed. Then, this sampling
   error estimate is used as part of a Bayesian extension of Richardson
   extrapolation in order to characterize the discretization error. These
   methods are tested using the Lorenz equations and are shown to perform
   well. These techniques are then used to investigate the sampling and
   discretization errors in the DNS of a wall-bounded turbulent flow at
   Re-tau approximate to 180. Both small (L-x/delta x L-z/delta = 4 pi x 2
   pi) and large (L-x/delta x L-z/delta = 12 pi x 4 pi) domain sizes are
   investigated. For each case, a sequence of meshes was generated by first
   designing a ``nominal{''} mesh using standard heuristics for
   wall-bounded simulations. These nominal meshes were then coarsened to
   generate a sequence of grid resolutions appropriate for the Bayesian
   Richardson extrapolation method. In addition, the small box case is
   computationally inexpensive enough to allow simulation on a finer mesh,
   enabling the results of the extrapolation to be validated in a weak
   sense. For both cases, it is found that while the sampling uncertainty
   is large enough to make the order of accuracy difficult to determine,
   the estimated discretization errors are quite small. This indicates that
   the commonly used heuristics provide adequate resolution for this class
   of problems. However, it is also found that, for some quantities, the
   discretization error is not small relative to sampling error, indicating
   that the conventional wisdom that sampling error dominates
   discretization error for this class of simulations needs to be
   reevaluated. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports a combined experimental and numerical study on the
   efficient operation of Porous Substrate Bioreactors. A comprehensive
   model integrating light transport, mass transport, and algal growth
   kinetics was used to understand the productivity of photosynthetic
   biofilms in response to delivery rates of photons and nutrients. The
   reactor under consideration was an evaporation driven Porous Substrate
   Bioreactor (PSBR) cultivating the cyanobacteria Anabaena variabilis as a
   biofilm on a porous substrate which delivers water and nutrients to the
   cells. In an unoptimized experimental case, this reactor was operated
   with a photosynthetic efficiency of 2.3\%, competitive with conventional
   photobioreactors. Moreover, through a scaling analysis, the location at
   which the phosphate delivery rate decreased the growth rate to half of
   its uninhibited value was predicted as a function of microorganism and
   bioreactor properties. The numerical model along with the flux balancing
   techniques presented herein can serve as tools for designing and
   selecting operating parameters of biofilm based cultivation systems for

Abstract = {{A diverse spectrum of technology drivers such as improved thermal
   barriers, higher efficiency thermoelectric energy conversion,
   phase-change memory, heat-assisted magnetic recording, thermal
   management of nanoscale electronics, and nanoparticles for thermal
   medical therapies are motivating studies of the applied physics of
   thermal transport at the nanoscale. This review emphasizes developments
   in experiment, theory, and computation in the past ten years and
   summarizes the present status of the field. Interfaces become
   increasingly important on small length scales. Research during the past
   decade has extended studies of interfaces between simple metals and
   inorganic crystals to interfaces with molecular materials and liquids
   with systematic control of interface chemistry and physics. At
   separations on the order of similar to 1 nm, the science of radiative
   transport through nanoscale gaps overlaps with thermal conduction by the
   coupling of electronic and vibrational excitations across weakly bonded
   or rough interfaces between materials. Major advances in the physics of
   phonons include first principles calculation of the phonon lifetimes of
   simple crystals and application of the predicted scattering rates in
   parameter-free calculations of the thermal conductivity. Progress in the
   control of thermal transport at the nanoscale is critical to continued
   advances in the density of information that can be stored in phase
   change memory devices and new generations of magnetic storage that will
   use highly localized heat sources to reduce the coercivity of magnetic
   media. Ultralow thermal conductivity-thermal conductivity below the
   conventionally predicted minimum thermal conductivity-has been observed
   in nanolaminates and disordered crystals with strong anisotropy.
   Advances in metrology by time-domain thermoreflectance have made
   measurements of the thermal conductivity of a thin layer with
   micron-scale spatial resolution relatively routine. Scanning thermal
   microscopy and thermal analysis using proximal probes has achieved
   spatial resolution of 10 nm, temperature precision of 50 mK, sensitivity
   to heat flows of 10 pW, and the capability for thermal analysis of
   sub-femtogram samples. (C) 2014 Author(s). All article content, except

Abstract = {{In this work, we develop and evaluate polycationic nanoparticles for the
   delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Delivery remains a major
   challenge for translating siRNA to the clinic, and overcoming the
   delivery challenge requires effective siRNA delivery vehicles that meet
   the demands of the specific delivery strategy. Cross-linked polycationic
   nanoparticle formulations were synthesized using ARGET ATRP or
   UV-initiated polymerization. The one-step, one-pot,
   surfactant-stabilized monomer-in-water synthesis technique may provide a
   simpler and faster alternative to complicated, multistep techniques and
   an alternative to methods that rely on toxic organic solvents. The
   polymer nanoparticles were synthesized using the cationic monomer
   2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate, the hydrophobic monomer tert-butyl
   methacrylate to tune pH responsiveness, the hydrophilic monomer
   poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate to improve
   biocompatibility, and cross-linking agent tetraethylene glycol
   dimethacrylate to enhance colloidal stability. Four formulations were
   evaluated for their suitability as siRNA delivery vehicles in vitro with
   the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T or the murine macrophage
   cell line RAW264.7. The polycationic nanoparticles demonstrated
   efficient and rapid loading of the anionic siRNA following complexation.
   Confocal microscopy as well as flow cytometry analysis of cells treated
   with polycationic nanoparticles loaded with fluorescently labeled siRNA
   demonstrated that the polycationic nanoparticles promoted cellular
   uptake of fluorescently labeled siRNA. Knockdown experiments using
   polycationic nanoparticles to deliver siRNA demonstrated evidence of
   knockdown, thus demonstrating potential as an alternative route to
   creating polycationic nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of pore size and porosity on the performance of phase change
   material (PCM) infiltrated metal foams, especially when the pore size
   reduces to less than 100 gm, is investigated in this study. A three
   dimensional finite element model was developed to consider both the
   metal and PCM domains, with heat exchange between them. The pore size
   and porosity effects were studied along with other system variables
   including heat generation and dissipation of the PCM-based thermal
   management system. It is shown that both porosity and pore size have
   strong effects on the heating of PCM. At a fixed porosity, a smaller
   pore size results in a lower temperature at the heat source for a longer
   period of time. The effects of pore size and porosity were more
   pronounced at high heat generation and low convective cooling
   conditions, representing the situation of portable electronics. There is
   an optimal porosity for the PCM-metal foam system; however, the optimal
   value only occurs at high cooling conditions. The net effective thermal
   conductivity of a PCM-microcellular metal foam system could be doubled
   by reducing the pore size from 100 mu m to 25 mu m. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In order to respond to the challenge of climate change, similar to other
   countries, Korea has announced various policies to vitalize the
   development and uptake of renewable energy. The Renewable Portfolio
   Standard (RPS) is the most striking example of a policy in this area.
   This study employs a conjoint survey and Bayesian mixed logit model to
   analyze consumer preferences for specific attributes of the RPS policy.
   It analyzes households' marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for the RPS
   with specific attributes and simulates the degree of household
   acceptability of the policy through a scenario analysis. Comparison
   between costs and benefits of implementing the policy is also attempted
   by analyzing the households' MWTP with the actual transition expense of
   RPS implementation incurred by electricity supply companies. The
   simulation results provide implications for improving RPS policy
   implementation; households consider the creation of new jobs as the most
   important policy attribute, followed by increase in electricity prices,
   damage to forests, reduction in CO2 emissions, and length of power
   outages. Moreover, the Korean household is willing to accept an increase
   of up to 1.39\% in its electricity prices (relative to 2012), and the
   median MWTP of each household for RPS implementation is KRW 734.99/month
   (USD 0.67/month). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For thermophysical energy storage with phase change materials (PCMs),
   the power capacity is often limited by the low PCM thermal conductivity
   (kappa(PCM)). Though dispersing high-thermal conductivity nanotubes and
   graphene flakes increases kappa(PCM), the enhancement is limited by
   interface thermal resistance between the nanofillers, among other
   factors such as detrimental surface scattering of phonons. Here, we
   demonstrate that embedding continuous ultrathin-graphite foams (UGFs)
   with volume fractions as low as 0.8-1.2 vol\% in a PCM can increase
   kappa(PCM) by up to 18 times, with negligible change in the PCM melting
   temperature or mass specific heat of fusion. The increase in kappa(PCM),
   thermal cycling stability, and applicability to a diverse range of PCMs
   suggests that UGF composites are a promising route to achieving the high
   power capacity targets of a number of thermal storage applications,
   including building and vehicle heating and cooling, solar thermal
   harvesting, and thermal management of electrochemical energy storage and

Abstract = {{Modern space situational awareness encompasses the detection, tracking,
   identification, and characterization of resident space objects. As the
   population density of Earth orbiting objects continues to increase, the
   goal of maintaining accurate space situational awareness grows ever more
   challenging. Tracking a population of this magnitude when the objects
   are sizeable enough for ground-based sensors to monitor is sufficiently
   challenging on its own. Additional complexities arise when objects below
   a certain size are considered, in the nano- and picosatellite range, for
   instance. As miniaturized satellite hardware continues to evolve, the
   density of objects in this range becomes a concern because, though
   small, they can still present a threat to orbiting assets. In this case,
   it is useful to supplement ground-sensor capabilities with orbiting
   platforms to support situational awareness goals. This study is focused
   on the application of numerical techniques, leveraging concepts from
   computer graphics, to develop a coverage model for the planar
   above-the-horizon coverage case. The model is general in that sensor and
   target regions may be heterogeneous and of any planar shape. The ensuing
   time-invariant and time-varying examples demonstrate approaches to
   numerically address the problem of optimal constellation design for
   space situational awareness applications.}},

Abstract = {{The growing number of resident space objects in Earth orbit has made
   effective monitoring a formidable task. Supplementing the capabilities
   of ground-based sensor networks with on-orbit sensing platforms would
   dramatically enhance the ability of such systems to detect, track,
   identify, and characterize resident space objects. To facilitate
   constellation design that promotes these goals, an optimization approach
   is selected, which inherently requires a predefined mathematical
   representation of a cost index or measure of merit. Such representations
   are often analytically available, but when considering optimal
   constellation design for space-based space situational awareness
   applications, a closed-form expression for the cost index is only
   available under certain assumptions. The present study focuses on a
   subset of cases that admit exact representations. In this case,
   geometrical arguments are employed to establish an analytical
   formulation for the coverage area provided as well as for certain
   coverage multiplicities. These analytical results are essential in
   validating numerical approximations that are able to simulate more
   complex configurations. Benefits of the cost index are also investigated
   by demonstrating in tradeoff studies that a significant reduction in the
   optimal number of satellites can be achieved compared to that predicted
   by the traditional streets-of-coverage technique.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As chamber conditions gradually change with wafer processing, periodic
   wet cleaning is an inevitable event in semiconductor manufacturing.
   Since the chamber conditions are initialized during the wet cleaning, a
   chamber conditioning process called chamber seasoning follows the wet
   cleaning step. In this paper, a systematic procedure to optimize chamber
   seasoning for plasma etching is proposed, and the effectiveness is
   demonstrated in a semiconductor manufacturing environment. In order to
   quantitatively analyze plasma conditions for chamber seasoning and to
   achieve the optimum conditions objectively, a normalization technique
   for optical emission spectroscopy called a self-background normalization
   technique and a computational optimization process is suggested. By
   applying the optimized chamber seasoning conditions, a plasma reactor
   which is suffering from a serious etch rate drift after wet cleaning
   returns to a production ready status. Also, the etch rate of Si, which
   is an index for production readiness, is perfectly matched to 37.8A/s
   for production. Hopefully, the proposed methodology in this paper will
   be disseminated to semiconductor manufacturers who experience similar
   issues after wet cleaning. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{1-13}},

Abstract = {{Carsharing programs that operate as short-term vehicle rentals (often
   for one-way trips before ending the rental) like Car2Go and ZipCar have
   quickly expanded, with the number of US users doubling every 1-2 years
   over the past decade. Such programs seek to shift personal
   transportation choices from an owned asset to a service used on demand.
   The advent of autonomous or fully self-driving vehicles will address
   many current carsharing barriers, including users' travel to access
   available vehicles.
   This work describes the design of an agent-based model for shared
   autonomous vehicle (SAV) operations, the results of many case-study
   applications using this model, and the estimated environmental benefits
   of such settings, versus conventional vehicle ownership and use. The
   model operates by generating trips throughout a grid-based urban area,
   with each trip assigned an origin, destination and departure time, to
   mimic realistic travel profiles. A preliminary model run estimates the
   SAV fleet size required to reasonably service all trips, also using a
   variety of vehicle relocation strategies that seek to minimize future
   traveler wait times. Next, the model is run over one-hundred days, with
   driverless vehicles ferrying travelers from one destination to the next.
   During each 5-min interval, some unused SAVs relocate, attempting to
   shorten wait times for next-period travelers.
   Case studies vary trip generation rates, trip distribution patterns,
   network congestion levels, service area size, vehicle relocation
   strategies, and fleet size. Preliminary results indicate that each SAV
   can replace around eleven conventional vehicles, but adds up to 10\%
   more travel distance than comparable non-SAV trips, resulting in overall
   beneficial emissions impacts, once fleet-efficiency changes and embodied
   versus in-use emissions are assessed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The microscopic response characteristics of nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) are widely used for characterizing complex pore structures of
   rocks. Due to the prohibitive NMR experiment cost, numerical simulation
   was employed as an alternative approach to verify some theoretical
   aspects of NMR responses. Firstly, the basic principles of pore-scale
   NMR simulation based on random-walk method (RWM) were introduced. The
   RWM-simulated results were benchmarked with the analytical results for
   an ideal spherical pore model. Then, the effects of two numerical
   parameters, namely diffusion radius and walk numbers, were studied on
   the simulation accuracy. The simulation method is then applied to
   various pore models with different pore sizes and pore shapes filled
   with different fluids to study the microscopic NMR response
   characteristics. The numerical experiments are useful for understanding
   and interpreting NMR measurements and the simulation code provides a
   numerical tool to perform pixel-based digital rock analysis.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{12-19}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the capability of a roof based, passive,
   evaporative pumping system to lessen thermal loadings imposed on the
   interior of a building thus reducing air conditioning energy
   consumption. To do so, an instrumented experimental setup was
   constructed wherein a porous membrane rested on top of an air cooled
   copper plate while heated by a halogen lamp from above. From the
   membrane, water evaporated while drawing replenishment from a separated
   reservoir. The tests aimed to determine the ability of such a system to
   lessen roof temperatures and heat fluxes into the building compared to
   traditional (e.g., dark ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)) and
   non-traditional roofs (e.g., white). The results indicated that the
   evaporation system considered kept the plate temperature of the test
   section considerably lower than competing options, for a typical summer
   day in Austin, TX. Additionally, with the use of reclaimed water in
   mind, the system's performance was evaluated under membrane fouling
   conditions, which was shown to affect the evaporation rate of the porous
   membrane. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel receiver for orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions in impulsive noise environments.
   Impulsive noise arises in many modern wireless and wireline
   communication systems, such as Wi-Fi and powerline communications, due
   to uncoordinated interference that is much stronger than thermal noise.
   We first show that the bit-error-rate optimal receiver jointly estimates
   the propagation channel coefficients, the noise impulses, the
   finite-alphabet symbols, and the unknown bits. We then propose a
   near-optimal yet computationally tractable approach to this joint
   estimation problem using loopy belief propagation. In particular, we
   merge the recently proposed ``generalized approximate message
   passing{''} (GAMP) algorithm with the forward-backward algorithm and
   soft-input soft-output decoding using a ``turbo{''} approach. Numerical
   results indicate that the proposed receiver drastically outperforms
   existing receivers under impulsive noise and comes within 1 dB of the
   matched-filter bound. Meanwhile, with tones, the proposed
   factor-graph-based receiver has only O(N log N) complexity, and it can
   be parallelized.}},

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{HVAC filters are commonly used to decrease exposure to particulate
   matter, yet little is known about the energy impacts and air quality
   consequences of high efficiency filters installed in commercial
   buildings. To explore these effects, system airflow, filter and coil
   pressure drop, fan pressure rise, and power draw were measured, and
   cooling capacity and compressor power were modeled for at least four
   filter pressure drops in 15 rooftop units equipped with and without fan
   speed control. Energy implications and clean-air-delivery-rate were
   estimated for a large dataset of filters divided into four efficiency
   (MERV) categories. Field measurements conducted on units without fan
   speed control showed that increased filter pressure drop decreased flow,
   cooling capacity, and power. For a unit with fan speed control, the same
   increase in pressure drop resulted in the same magnitude change of fan
   power but in the opposite direction, and other parameters were
   unchanged. Replacing MERV 8 with MERV 13/14 resulted in higher energy
   consumption (2-4\%) during cooling mode for both unit types, energy
   savings during fan-only mode (8-13\%) in units without fan speed
   control, and increased energy consumption in fan-only mode (11-18\%) in
   the unit with fan speed control. Energy consumption increases were
   offset by improvement in clean-air-delivery-rate, especially for PM2.5
   (2.9-3.8 times increase going from MERV 8 to MERV 13/14), with larger
   benefits achieved for the unit with fan speed control. A comprehensive
   understanding of the impact of filtration is essential to selecting the
   appropriate efficiency of filters that ensures low-energy use and a
   healthy indoor environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Class-D line driver that utilizes a phase-locked loop (PLL) for PWM
   generation is presented. The principle of operation and implementation
   details relating to loop stability, linearity and noise performance are
   analyzed. An implementation is presented in a 130 nm CMOS process. The
   amplifier can deliver 1.2 W into a 6.8 Omega load with a 4.8 V power
   supply. The architecture eliminates the requirements for a high-quality
   carrier generator and a high-speed voltage comparator that are often
   required in PWM implementations. It can achieve a THD of -65 dB, for a
   sinusoidal input with a frequency of 60 kHz, while employing a switching
   frequency that can be as high as 20 MHz. The peak efficiency is 83\% for
   output power larger than 1 W for a switching frequency of 10 MHz. The
   die area is 2.25 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels have been widely used for 3-dimensional (3D) cell culture and
   tissue regeneration due to their tunable biochemical and physicochemical
   properties as well as their high water content, which resembles the
   aqueous microenvironment of the natural extracellular matrix. While many
   properties of natural hydrogel matrices are modifiable, their intrinsic
   isotropic structure limits the control over cellular organization, which
   is critical to restore tissue function. Here we report a generic
   approach to incorporate alignment topography inside the hydrogel matrix
   using a combination of electrical and mechanical stretching. Hydrogel
   fibres with uniaxial alignment were prepared from aqueous solutions of
   natural polymers such as alginate, fibrin, gelatin, and hyaluronic acid
   under ambient conditions. The unique internal alignment feature
   drastically enhances the mechanical properties of the hydrogel
   microfibres. Furthermore, the facile, organic solvent-free processing
   conditions are amenable to the incorporation of live cells within the
   hydrogel fibre or on the fibre surface; both approaches effectively
   induce cellular alignment. This work demonstrates a versatile and
   scalable strategy to create aligned hydrogel microfibres from various
   natural polymers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The screening of new active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) has become
   more streamlined and as a result the number of new drugs in the pipeline
   is steadily increasing. However, a major limiting factor of new API
   approval and market introduction is the low solubility associated with a
   large percentage of these new drugs. While many modification strategies
   have been studied to improve solubility such as salt formation and
   addition of cosolvents, most provide only marginal success and have
   severe disadvantages. One of the most successful methods to date is the
   mechanical reduction of drug particle size, inherently increasing the
   surface area of the particles and, as described by the Noyes-Whitney
   equation, the dissolution rate. Drug micronization has been the gold
   standard to achieve these improvements; however, the extremely low
   solubility of some new chemical entities is not significantly affected
   by size reduction in this range. A reduction in size to the nanometric
   scale is necessary. Bottom-up and top-down techniques are utilized to
   produce drug crystals in this size range; however, as discussed in this
   review, top-down approaches have provided greater enhancements in drug
   usability on the industrial scale. The six FDA approved products that
   all exploit top-down approaches confirm this. In this review, the
   advantages and disadvantages of both approaches will be discussed in
   addition to specific top-down techniques and the improvements they
   contribute to the pharmaceutical field.}},

Title = {{Determination of isotopic ratios of uranium samples using passive gamma

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{299}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Uranium samples of various enrichments have been passively counted on
   the University of Texas detector gamma-gamma coincidence system. By
   observing gamma rays emitted from U-235 and its daughters compared to
   gamma rays emitted by U-238 daughters and comparing the data to
   standards of known enrichments, a technique has been developed to take a
   uranium sample of unknown enrichment and passively count it to determine
   its uranium isotopic concentration. Because the gamma rays from U-235
   are generally in the low-energy regime, there is a strong susceptibility
   to background interferences, especially from the Compton background
   produced from higher energy gamma rays. Other interferences, such as
   those from the decay series of uranium also exist for U-235 gamma rays.
   In this light, we have collected data using list-mode to produce
   two-dimensional gamma-gamma coincidence spectra, which allows us to gate
   the low-energy gamma rays from U-235 with gamma rays that are in
   coincidence. In doing this, much of the low energy interferences are
   reduced, and one can analyze the U-235 gamma rays with high precision.
   Because of the high density of uranium, self-shielding has significant
   effects especially in the low-energy regime. To correct for this
   attenuation the detector system has been modeled by MCNP and
   self-shielding factors have been calculated across the energy spectrum.
   A big advantage to this method is the capability of performing this
   analysis with small (<1 g) samples in a non-destructive and relatively
   inexpensive manner. If necessary, this analysis can be performed within
   24 h if an urgent nuclear forensics scenario arises.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{359-384}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic simulation of turbulent inflow fields commonly used in wind
   turbine load computations is unable to account for contrasting states of
   atmospheric stability. Flow fields in the stable boundary layer, for
   instance, have characteristics such as enhanced wind speed and
   directional shear; these effects can influence loads on utility-scale
   wind turbines. To investigate these influences, we use large-eddy
   simulation (LES) to generate an extensive database of high-resolution
   (approximate to 10m), four-dimensional turbulent flow fields. Key
   atmospheric conditions (e.g.,geostrophic wind) and surface conditions
   (e.g.,aerodynamic roughness length) are systematically varied to
   generate a diverse range of physically realizable atmospheric
   stabilities. We show that turbine-scale variables (e.g.,hub height wind
   speed, standard deviation of the longitudinal wind speed, wind speed
   shear, wind directional shear and Richardson number) are strongly
   interrelated. Thus, we strongly advocate that these variables should not
   be prescribed as independent degrees of freedom in any synthetic
   turbulent inflow generator but rather that any turbulence generation
   procedure should be able to bring about realistic sets of such
   physically realizable sets of turbine-scale flow variables. We
   demonstrate the utility of our LES-generated database in estimation of
   loads on a 5-MW wind turbine model. More importantly, we identify
   specific turbine-scale flow variables that are responsible for large
   turbine loadse.g., wind speed shear is found to have a greater influence
   on out-of-plane blade bending moments for the turbine studied compared
   with its influence on other loads such as the tower-top yaw moment and
   the fore-aft tower base moment.Overall, our study suggests that LES may
   be effectively used to model inflow fields, to study characteristics of
   flow fields under various atmospheric stability conditions and to assess
   turbine loads for conditions that are not typically examined in design
   standards. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and implementation of a Meshless
   two-phase incompressible fluid flow solver and its acceleration using
   the graphics processing unit (GPU). The solver is formulated as a
   Localized Radial-Basis Function Collocation Meshless Method and the
   interface of the two-phase flow is captured using an implementation of
   the Level-Set method. The Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)
   language for general-purpose computing on the CPU is used to accelerate
   the solver. Through the combined use of the LRC Meshless method and GPU
   acceleration this paper seeks to address the issue of robustness and
   speed in computational fluid dynamics. Traditional mesh-based methods
   require extensive and time-consuming user input for the generation and
   verification of a computational mesh. The LRC meshless method seeks to
   mitigate this issue through the use of a set of scattered points that
   need not meet stringent geometric requirements like those required by
   finite-volume and finite-element methods, such as connectivity and
   poligonalization. The method is shown to render very accurate and stable
   solutions and the implementation of the solver on the CPU is shown to
   accelerate the solution by several orders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND During radiofrequency ablation, effective contact is crucial
   in determining lesions efficacy.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare operators' ability to
   assess contact pressure using visual and tactile feedbacks together or
   alone in an experimental model.
   METHODS In a in vitro experimental setup replicating manual catheter
   manipulation and recording the applied force, evaluators were asked to
   identify three Levels of force (first, ablation, and maximum contact) as
   the catheter contacted the tissue model using (1) visual feedback only
   by fluoroscopy, ``blinded{''} to touch; (2) tactile feedback only,
   blinded to fluoroscopy; and (3) both tactile and visual feedback
   together. The Latter was regarded as reference. The experiment was
   repeated using a catheter force sensing technology during robotic
   navigation.
   RESULTS During manual navigation, tighter association was shown for the
   visual method than for the tactile method: median difference with
   reference: first contact -1 (P =.97) vs -2 (P =.90); ablation contact 2
   (P =.1) vs -7 (P =.03); maximum contact 2 (P =.06) vs -28 (P =.02).
   Bland-Altman plot and Deming regression confirmed for the visual method
   the good agreement with reference and the absence of bias at any level
   and showed for the tactile higher values and proportional bias that
   reached statistical significance at ablation and maximum contact. During
   robotic navigation, agreement was higher for the tactile than for the
   visual only method.
   CLUSION During manual navigation, visual feedback alone is in better
   agreement with the reference compared to the tactile only approach.
   During robotic navigation, agreement is Looser for the visual only
   approach. More objective feedback of contact pressure during ablation
   procedures is desirable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a network information flow problem for a
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian wireless network with K
   users and a single intermediate relay having M antennas. In this
   network, each user sends a multicast message to all other users while
   receiving K - 1 independent messages from the other users via an
   intermediate relay. This network information flow is termed a MIMO
   Gaussian K-way relay channel. For this channel, it is shown that the
   optimal sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) is KM/K - 1, assuming that all
   nodes have global channel knowledge and operate in full-duplex. A
   converse argument is derived by cut-set bounds. The achievability is
   shown by a repetition coding scheme with random beamforming in encoding
   and a zero-forcing method combined with self-interference cancelation in
   decoding. Furthermore, under the premise that all nodes have local
   channel state information at the receiver only and operate in
   half-duplex mode, it is shown that a total K/2 DoF is achievable when
   M=K-1. The key to showing this result is a novel encoding and decoding
   scheme, which creates a set of network code messages with a chain
   structure during the multiple access phase and performs successive
   interference cancelation using side-information for the broadcast phase.
   One major implication of the derived results is that efficient
   exploitation of the transmit message as sideinformation leads to an
   increase in the sum-DoF gain in a multiway relay channel with multicast
   messages.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we provide the details of the predictive simulations
   performed by the University of Texas team in response to the 2012 Sandia
   Fracture Challenge (Boyce et al. in The Sandia Fracture challenge: blind
   predictions of ductile tearing. Int J Fract. doi:
   10.1007/10704-013-9904-6, 2013). The material constitutive model was
   calibrated using the tensile test data through an optimization scheme. A
   modified Johnson-Cook failure criterion was also partially calibrated
   using the material characterization data obtained from a tension test
   and a compact-tension fracture test. These models are then embedded in a
   highly refined finite element simulation to perform a blind prediction
   of the failure behavior of the Sandia Fracture Challenge geometry. These
   results are compared with experiments performed by Sandia National
   Laboratories and additional experiments that were performed at the
   University of Texas at Austin with full-field three-dimensional digital
   image correlation in order to explore the different failure modes. It is
   demonstrated that a well-calibrated model that captures the essential
   elasticplastic constitutive behavior is necessary to confidently capture
   the elasto-plastic response of challenging structural geometries; it is
   also shown that a simple ductile failure model can be used to predict
   ductile failure correctly, when proper calibration of the material model
   is established.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Patients with bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are predisposed
   to developing ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) at an earlier
   age than patients who develop degenerative TAAs and have a tricuspid
   aortic valve (TAV). The hypothesis tested is that BAV-associated
   aortopathy is mediated by a mechanism of matrix remodeling that is
   distinct from that seen in TAAs of patients with tricuspid aortic
   valves.
   Methods: Aortic specimens were collected during ascending aortic
   replacement, aortic valve replacement, and heart transplants from
   nonaneurysmal (NA) donors and recipients. Matrix architecture of the
   aortic media was assessed qualitatively using multiphoton microscopy
   followed by quantification of collagen and elastin fiber orientation.
   a-Elastin was determined and matrix maturity was assessed by quantifying
   immature and mature collagen and lysyl oxidase (Lox) expression and
   activity in aortic specimens. Matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 activity was
   quantified in aortic smooth muscle cells.
   Results: Elastin and collagen fibers were more highly aligned in BAV-NA
   and BAV-TAA cases than in TAV-TAA cases, whereas TAV-TAA cases were more
   disorganized than TAV-NA cases. a-Elastin content was unchanged.
   Immature collagen was reduced in BAV-NA and BAV-TAA cases when compared
   with TAV-NA and TAV-TAA cases. Mature collagen was elevated in TAV-TAA
   cases compared with TAV-NA and BAV-TAA cases. There was a trend toward
   elevated Lox gene expression and activity and matrix
   metalloproteinase-2/9 activity for TAV-TAA, BAV-NA, and BAV-TAA
   specimens.
   Conclusions: The highly aligned matrix architecture in patients with
   BAVs indicates that wall remodeling is distinct from TAV-TAA. Altered
   matrix architecture and reduced collagen maturity suggest that the
   effector molecules mediating the remodeling of TAAs are different in BAV
   and TAV cases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the second in the series of three addressing the problem
   of how to deal with uncertainties in the modelings of engineering
   problems using only available data. The problem of the heat exchanger
   was selected as the example because it is sufficiently complex but still
   simple so that the difficulties and ideas will be apparent. There are
   various theories on how to treat the uncertainties in the first paper.
   In the series we use only the fuzzy set, respectively the possibility
   theory. In this paper we use the fuzzy approach for some model
   parameters and the probability approach for the others. The third paper
   will use the Bayesian theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Discontinuous Galerkin methods with nodal and hybrid modal/nodal
   triangular, quadrilateral, and polygonal elements for nonlinear shallow
   water flow}},

Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive assessment of nodal and hybrid modal/nodal
   discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element solutions on a range of
   unstructured meshes to nonlinear shallow water flow with smooth
   solutions. The nodal DG methods on triangles and a tensor-product nodal
   basis on quadrilaterals are considered. The hybrid modal/nodal DG
   methods utilize two different synergistic polynomial bases on polygons
   in realizing the DG discretization; orthogonal basis functions
   constructed by the Gram-Schmidt process are used as trial and test
   functions in a DG weak formulation; and a nodal basis is used as an
   efficient means for area integration. These are implemented on
   triangular, quadrilateral, and polygonal elements. In addition, we
   discuss aspects to be considered in order to achieve the so-called
   well-balanced property that preserves steady state at rest with a
   spatially varying bed. The performance in terms of accuracy and
   computational cost is demonstrated using h and p convergence studies on
   a nonlinear problem with a manufactured solution and the nonlinear
   Stommel problem with flat and non-flat beds. To assess the performance
   of quadrilateral and polygonal elements in comparison to triangular
   elements, we consider a setting in which a quadrilateral mesh, a mixed
   triangular-quadrilateral mesh, and polygonal mesh are derived from a
   given triangular mesh and vice versa. The tests conducted reveal the
   merit of using the quadrilateral elements in terms of computational cost
   per accuracy and computing time. More importantly, the numerical results
   clearly show that high order schemes significantly improve the cost
   performance for a given level of accuracy, with cubic or bi-cubic
   interpolants particularly achieving dramatic improvements in accuracy as
   compared to linear and quadratic interpolants, with diminishing benefit
   as p > 3. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a blind (no reference or NR) video quality evaluation model
   that is nondistortion specific. The approach relies on a spatio-temporal
   model of video scenes in the discrete cosine transform domain, and on a
   model that characterizes the type of motion occurring in the scenes, to
   predict video quality. We use the models to define video statistics and
   perceptual features that are the basis of a video quality assessment
   (VQA) algorithm that does not require the presence of a pristine video
   to compare against in order to predict a perceptual quality score. The
   contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) We propose a
   spatio-temporal natural scene statistics (NSS) model for videos. 2) We
   propose a motion model that quantifies motion coherency in video scenes.
   3) We show that the proposed NSS and motion coherency models are
   appropriate for quality assessment of videos, and we utilize them to
   design a blind VQA algorithm that correlates highly with human judgments
   of quality. The proposed algorithm, called video BLIINDS, is tested on
   the LIVE VQA database and on the EPFL-PoliMi video database and shown to
   perform close to the level of top performing reduced and full reference
   VQA algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Using a silicon nitride cantilever with an integral silicon tip and a
   microfabricated platinum-carbon resistance thermometer located close to
   the tip, a method is developed to concurrently measure both the heat
   transfer through and adhesion energy of a nanoscale point contact formed
   between the sharp silicon tip and a silicon substrate in an ultrahigh
   vacuum atomic force microscope at near room temperature. Several models
   are used to evaluate the contact area critical for interpreting the
   interfacial resistance. Near field-thermal radiation conductance was
   found to be negligible compared to the measured interface thermal
   conductance determined based on the possible contact area range. If the
   largest possible contact area is assumed, the obtained thermal interface
   contact resistance can be explained by a nanoconstriction model that
   allows the transmission of phonons from the whole Brillouin zone of bulk
   Si with an average finite transmissivity larger than 0.125. In addition,
   an examination of the quantum thermal conductance expression suggests
   the inaccuracy of such a model for explaining measurement results
   obtained at above room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{We study a stochastic interdiction model of Morton et al. IIE
   Transactions, 39 (2007):3-14 that locates radiation sensors at border
   crossings to detect and prevent the smuggling of nuclear material. In
   this model, an interdictor places sensors at customs checkpoints to
   minimize a potential smuggler's maximum probability of crossing a border
   undetected. We focus on a model variant in which the interdictor has
   different, and likely more accurate, perceptions of the system's
   parameters than the smuggler does. We introduce a model that is tighter
   and uses fewer constraints than that of Morton et al. We also develop a
   class of valid inequalities along with a corresponding separation
   procedure that can be used within a cutting-plane approach to reduce
   computational effort. Computational results demonstrate the

Title = {{Enhanced traffic information dissemination to facilitate toll road
   utilization: a nested logit model of a stated preference survey in Texas}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of the provision of traffic
   information on toll road usage based on a stated preference survey
   conducted in central Texas. Although many researchers have studied
   congestion pricing and traffic information dissemination extensively,
   most of them focused on the effects that these instruments individually
   produce on transportation system performance. Few studies have been
   conducted to elaborate on the impacts of traffic information
   dissemination on toll road utilization. In this study, 716 individuals
   completed a survey to measure representative public opinions and
   preferences for toll road usage in support of various traffic
   information dissemination classified by different modes, contents, and
   timeliness categories. A nested logit model was developed and estimated
   to identify the significant attributes of traffic information
   dissemination, traveler commuting patterns, routing behavior, and
   demographic characteristics, and analyze their impacts on toll road
   utilization. The results revealed that the travelers using dynamic
   message sign systems as their primary mode of receiving traffic
   information are more likely to choose toll roads. The potential toll
   road users also indicated their desire to obtain traffic information via
   internet. Information regarding accident locations, road hazard
   warnings, and congested roads is frequently sought by travelers.
   Furthermore, high-quality congested road information dissemination can
   significantly enhance travelers' preferences of toll road usage.
   Specifically the study found that travelers anticipated an average
   travel time saving of about 11.3 min from better information; this is
   about 30 \% of travelers' average one-way commuting time. The mean value
   of the time savings was found to be about \$11.82 per hour, close to
   A1/2 of the average Austin wage rate. The model specifications and
   result analyses provide in-depth insights in interpreting travelers'
   behavioral tendencies of toll road utilization in support of traffic
   information. The results are also helpful to shape and develop future
   transportation toll system and transportation policy.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-based materials have been proposed as promising electrodes for
   electric double layer capacitors. Recently, it has been found that one
   of the limitations of graphene electrodes is the finite quantum
   capacitance at low applied voltage. In this work, we investigate the
   impact of having point-like topological defects in graphene on the
   electronic structure and quantum capacitance. Our results clearly show
   that the presence of defects, such as Stone Wales, di-vacancies, and
   di-interstitials, can substantially enhance the quantum capacitance when
   compared to pristine graphene, which is found to be due to
   defect-induced quasi-localized states near the Fermi level. In addition,
   the charging behavior tends to be asymmetric around the neutrality
   point. We also discuss the possibility of tuning the electronic
   structure and capacitance through mixtures of these defects. Our
   findings suggest that graphene-based electrodes with topological defects
   may demonstrate noteworthy capacitance but should be carefully selected
   for use as either the positive or negative electrode. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{FePt nanoparticles (NPs)/reduced graphene oxide (rG-O) composites have

   Monodisperse FePt NPs were homogenously loaded onto rG-O sheets. By

   FePt flower-like nanoclusters can be obtained. FePt/rG-O composites
   exhibited exceptionally high electrocatalytic performance in the
   activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), much
   superior to that of the commercial Pt/C (60\%). The straightforward
   synthesis of FePt/rG-O composites provides a low-cost and high

Abstract = {{A foamed polymer nanocomposite system is developed as an ablative for

   better thermal properties with the inherent benefit of being
   lightweight. In this study, Polyetherimide (PEI) was compounded with

   elastomer, Kraton, was added to improve the mechanical strain. Samples
   with various compositions of nanoclay and Kraton were foamed using a
   batch solid-state foaming process. The thermal protection performance of
   the material system was characterized with an oxyacetylene flame
   ablation test. It is shown that foaming helped reduce the mass loss of
   the samples during the ablation test. The loadings of nanoclay and
   Kraton and the foam density can be used to optimize the thermal
   protection performance. The foams obtained in this study had a graded

Abstract = {{With a huge increase in demand for various kinds of compute-intensive
   applications in electronic systems, researchers have focused on
   coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures because of their advantages:
   high performance and flexibility. This paper presents FloRA, a
   coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture with floating-point support.
   A two-dimensional array of integer processing elements in FloRA is
   configured at run-time to perform floating-point operations as well as
   integer operations. Fabricated using 130 nm process, the total area
   overhead due to additional hardware for floating-point operations is
   about 7.4\% compared to the previous architecture which does not support
   floating-point operations. The fabricated chip runs at 125 MHz clock
   frequency and 1.2 V power supply. Experiments show 11.6 x speedup on
   average compared to ARM9 with a vector-floating-point unit for
   integer-only benchmark programs as well as programs containing
   floating-point operations. Compared with other similar approaches
   including XPP and Butter, the proposed architecture shows much higher
   performance for integer applications, while maintaining about half the
   performance of Butter for floating-point applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We develop a preconditioned Bayesian regression method that enables
   sparse polynomial chaos representations of noisy outputs for stochastic
   chemical systems with uncertain reaction rates. The approach is based on
   the definition of an appropriate multiscale transformation of the state
   variables coupled with a Bayesian regression formalism. This enables
   efficient and robust recovery of both the transient dynamics and the
   corresponding noise levels. Implementation of the present approach is
   illustrated through applications to a stochastic Michaelis-Menten
   dynamics and a higher dimensional example involving a genetic positive
   feedback loop. In all cases, a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) is
   used to compute the system dynamics. Numerical experiments show that
   Bayesian preconditioning algorithms can simultaneously accommodate large
   noise levels and large variability with uncertain parameters, and that
   robust estimates can be obtained with a small number of SSA
   realizations.}},

Abstract = {{Biological processes such as protein degradation and mitochondrial
   protein import require protein passage, or translocation, across narrow
   pores. In addition to its biological significance, protein translocation
   through biological or engineered nanopores offers a powerful analytic
   tool for biophysics and nanotechnology. This mini-review discusses the
   physical mechanisms of protein translocation, as revealed by
   computational and theoretical studies. A simple, simulation-based model
   of translocation is presented, which provides a comprehensive
   description of this process and allows one to estimate experimentally
   observable quantities such as the dwell time of a protein inside the
   pore and the frequency of translocation events. Limitations of this
   model are further described and possible strategies to overcome them are
   outlined. Recent simulation studies are beginning to provide insights
   into the physical mechanisms that drive protein translocation in living
   systems, which are also discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{Sequentially coupled advanced oxidation-biodegradation systems have
   proven effective for treating a variety of wastewaters, but in several
   cases the pretreatment did not improve, or even hindered, subsequent
   biodegradation. Therefore, investigating the relationship between
   advanced oxidation pretreated effluent and subsequent bioreactor
   performance can help to optimize these systems. Here, a photocatalytic
   reactor was used to produce four unique effluents from
   2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP) by varying light wavelength, catalyst
   presence, and reaction time, demonstrating that the conditions of
   photocatalytic pretreatment can be tuned to achieve a variety of
   treatment objectives. The photocatalytic effluents were characterized
   for chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride release, aromaticity, and
   residual TCP concentration. The four effluents were normalized to 40 mg
   COD/L, combined with biological medium components, and fed to continuous
   bioreactors. Bioreactors were assayed for COD removal, TCP removal,
   optical density (OD), and microbial diversity via denaturing gradient
   gel electrophoresis. In general COD removal in the bioreactors increased
   as aromatic character of the photoeffluent decreased, but the least
   aromatic effluent performed poorly indicating the nuanced relationship
   between photoreactor effluent composition and bioreactor performance.
   While neither indicator of community diversity, richness nor evenness,
   correlated with COD removal or biomass accumulation, each effluent
   produced a unique community as indicated through similarity indices. All
   conditions demonstrated strong overall TCP removal. After two weeks at
   steady state, the reactors were perturbed with a 120-mu M spike of TCP.
   Overall the most aromatic photoeffluent produced the most resistant
   community to the perturbation, while the optimum effluents at steady
   state produced communities with poor resistance in terms of biomass
   accumulation and COD removal. These results highlight the tradeoffs
   between steady state performance and resistance to perturbation that are
   necessary to optimize a combined advanced oxidation-biodegradation
   treatment strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The 2009 Roadmap for Additive Manufacturing is a 92-page research agenda
   looking ahead 10-15 years. It was the result of a two-day meeting on
   March 30-31, 2009, in Washington, D.C., funded by the National Science
   Foundation and the Office of Naval Research. The objective was to
   develop and articulate a roadmap for research in the area of additive
   manufacturing for the next 10-12 years. The report addressed the needs
   and opportunities for technological advance in five areas: design;
   process modeling and control; materials, processes, and machines;
   biomedical applications; and energy and sustainability. There have been
   over 9,000 downloads of the roadmap report. The purpose of this article
   is to list the main findings of the report and to describe some of the
   significant impacts the report has had on the advancement of additive
   manufacturing technology.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing (AM) enables fabrication of complex structures,
   ranging from the overall geometry of a part to the topology of its
   internal architecture to the spatial distribution of its material

   representing and optimizing intricate geometries and functionally graded
   structures, incorporating Design for AM knowledge into the design
   process, and making Design for AM tools and knowledge more accessible to
   a broad range of expert and novice designers. Researchers are actively

Journal = {{CANCERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{545-579}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is an electrokinetic method that allows
   intrinsic dielectric properties of suspended cells to be exploited for
   discrimination and separation. It has emerged as a promising method for
   isolating circulation tumor cells (CTCs) from blood. DEP-isolation of
   CTCs is independent of cell surface markers. Furthermore, isolated CTCs
   are viable and can be maintained in culture, suggesting that DEP methods
   should be more generally applicable than antibody-based approaches. The
   aim of this article is to review and synthesize for both oncologists and
   biomedical engineers interested in CTC isolation the pertinent
   characteristics of DEP and CTCs. The aim is to promote an understanding
   of the factors involved in realizing DEP-based instruments having both
   sufficient discrimination and throughput to allow routine analysis of
   CTCs in clinical practice. The article brings together: (a) the
   principles of DEP; (b) the biological basis for the dielectric
   differences between CTCs and blood cells; (c) why such differences are
   expected to be present for all types of tumors; and (d) instrumentation
   requirements to process 10 mL blood specimens in less than 1 h to enable
   routine clinical analysis. The force equilibrium method of
   dielectrophoretic field-flow fractionation (DEP-FFF) is shown to offer
   higher discrimination and throughput than earlier DEP trapping methods
   and to be applicable to clinical studies.}},

Abstract = {{As I mentioned in my editorial, soft robotics is a highly collaborative
   field that relies on successful innovation in very diverse fields. Even
   the construction of a simple modest device might involve research
   spanning materials science, control theory, sensing, energy storage,
   flexible electronics, and a host of breakthroughs in more than one of
   these fields. Most researchers I know are fully engaged in the
   advancements within their own field and often lack the opportunity to
   discuss their projects and their project needs with experts in other
   disciplines. It is also a challenge for researchers with different
   backgrounds to communicate effectively and to be aware of new
   developments in distantly related technologies. A goal of Soft Robotics
   is to bridge such communication gaps and to share these collaborative
   discussions with you.
   To those ends, I have asked each of the following experts to comment on
   the state of their particular field: Randy H. Ewoldt, Design of
   Rheologically Complex Materials; Hod Lipson, Evolutionary Robotics;
   Mirko Kovac, Biomimetic Robots; Mohsen Shahinpoor, Soft Actuators;
   Nanshu Lu, Flexible Electronics, and Carmel Majidi, Soft Robotics. These
   insightful perspectives will be followed up by a lively discussion among
   the participants.}},

   analysis for glassy gas separation membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{453}},
Pages = {{71-83}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Prior analyses of the upper bound of permselectivity versus
   permeability, both theoretical and empirical, have assumed that this
   relationship is a consequence of the dependence of gas diffusion
   coefficients on the molecular diameter of the gases of interest. The
   solubility selectivity has been assumed to be invariant with
   permeability (and free volume). However, a few literature sources note
   that the solubility coefficient for specific families of glassy polymers
   correlate with free volume. A large database of permeability,
   diffusivity and solubility coefficients for glassy polymers was compiled
   to investigate this hypothesis. A critical analysis of the data
   demonstrates a modest solubility selectivity contribution to
   permselectivity as a function of free volume and, thus, permeability.
   The solubility selectivity (S-i/S-j) generally decreases with increasing
   permeability (and free volume) when the diameter of gas j is larger than
   that of gas i. This empirical trend is likely a consequence of larger
   gas molecules having less access than smaller molecules to sorption
   sites as the polymer packing density increases and free volume
   decreases. The diffusion data permit determination of a diffusivity
   upper bound, which is modestly different from the permeability-based
   upper bound relationship. The diffusion data analysis allows a
   determination of a new set of gas diameters more appropriate for gas
   diffusion in polymers than prior correlations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{453}},
Pages = {{425-434}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A series of sulfonated styrenic pentablock copolymers was characterized
   using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS).
   Ortho-positronium (o-Ps) lifetime was measured as a function of the
   polymer's degree of sulfonation and the environment in which the polymer
   was equilibrated. Samples ranged horn an un-sulfonated styrenic
   pentablock copolymer to one with an ion exchange capacity (IEC) of 2.0
   meq/g(dry polymer), and the samples were equilibrated in either air
   having 50\% relative humidity, de-ionized (DI) water, or 2000 mg L-1
   aqueous NaCl solution environments. The o-Ps lifetime, and thus, the
   average free volume element size, decreased as the polymer's degree of
   sulfonation increased and as the amount of water sorbed into the polymer
   increased, similar to reported decreases in o-Ps lifetime accompanying
   increased water sorption in uncharged cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol)
   hydrogels. The o-Ps lifetimes of the DI water equilibrated acid
   counter-ion form polymers were quite similar to those of the salt
   solution equilibrated sodium counter-ion form polymers, suggesting that
   the PALS data are not particularly sensitive to the counter-ion form of
   these hydrated polymers. Previously reported water and salt permeability
   data in polymers were correlated with the PALS data. Correlating water
   and salt permeability with free volume data, estimated using o-Ps
   lifetime, was complicated by the micro-phase separated nature of the
   block copolymers. The water permeability of polymers whose hydrophilic
   micro-domains are believed to be well connected correlated with free
   volume data, based on o-Ps lifetime. Salt permeability, however, did not
   correlate with free volume data estimated from o-Ps lifetime, according
   to free volume theory, in general, contributions of the hydrophobic
   micro-domain free volume to the PALS measurement frustrate the
   correlation of water and salt transport properties with PALS parameters
   in a manner that is not observed in other sulfonated and uncharged
   polymers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafast pulsed lasers can be used to achieve remarkable precision
   during surgical ablation. Through nonlinear interactions with tissue,
   ultrafast lasers can provide a largely non-thermal mechanism of ablation
   and a unique ability to create targeted damage within bulk tissue. These
   advantages have made ultrafast lasers the ideal surgical tool for
   various novel applications in ophthalmology. Clinical adoption of
   ultrafast lasers in other surgical applications remains limited in part
   due to the lack of a means for fiber delivery of ultrafast laser pulses
   as a flexible, hand-held surgical endoscope. This review provides an
   overview of the recent advances in bringing this unique surgical tool
   into the clinic. We discuss fundamental mechanisms and limitations of
   ultrafast laser ablation, novel techniques for overcoming these
   limitations, the current state of clinical applications, and conclude
   with our recent efforts in developing fiber-coupled probes for flexible

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have concluded that it is possible to interrupt the
   vision of human subjects using infrared (IR) light through an effect
   known as thermal lensing. While these experiments successfully
   demonstrated the influence of thermal lensing on an Amsler grid target,
   little has been done to quantify the amount of visual disruption
   resulting from this phenomenon. Therefore, an artificial eye system was
   configured to better quantify the refractive power of the thermal lens
   generated within the human eye. The influence of 1319 nm energy with
   power levels from 220 to 630 mW and exposure durations between 0.25 and
   1.00 s was evaluated based on changes induced within a visible probe
   beam (542 nm). Results showed up to a -2.0 D blur could be induced in
   human subjects using these energy levels. Results also established a
   relationship between the peak IR power and exposure durations used to
   determine the strength of the thermal lens.}},

Abstract = {{Determining accurate dissociation constants for equilibrium processes
   involving a fluorescent mechanism can prove to be quite challenging.
   Typically, titration curves and nonlinear least squares fitting of the
   data using computer programs are employed to obtain such constants.
   However, these approaches only consider the total fluorescence signal
   and often ignore other energy transfer processes within the system. The
   current model considers the impact on fluorescence from equilibrium
   binding (viz., metal-ligand, ligand-substrate, etc.), quenching, and
   resonance energy transfer. This model should provide more accurate
   binding constant as well as insights into other photonic processes. The
   equations developed for this model are discussed and are applied to
   experimental data from titrimetric experiments. Since the experimental
   data are generally in excess of the number of parameters that are needed
   to define the system, fitting is operated in an overdetermined mode and
   employs error minimization (either absolute or relative) to define
   goodness of fit. Examples of how changes in certain parameters affect
   the shape of the titrimetric curve are also presented. The current model
   does not consider chelation-enhanced fluorescence. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Syndecan-1 Regulates Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotype}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We examined the role of syndecan-1 in modulating the
   phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells in the context of endogenous
   inflammatory factors and altered microenvironments that occur in disease
   or injury-induced vascular remodeling.
   Methods and Results: Vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) display a
   continuum of phenotypes that can be altered during vascular remodeling.
   While the syndecans have emerged as powerful and complex regulators of
   cell function, their role in controlling vSMC phenotype is unknown.
   Here, we isolated vSMCs from wild type (WT) and syndecan-1 knockout
   (S1KO) mice. Gene expression and western blotting studies indicated
   decreased levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), calponin, and
   other vSMC-specific differentiation markers in S1KO relative to WT
   cells. The spread area of the S1KO cells was found to be greater than WT
   cells, with a corresponding increase in focal adhesion formation, Src
   phosphorylation, and alterations in actin cytoskeletal arrangement. In
   addition, S1KO led to increased S6RP phosphorylation and decreased AKT
   and PKC-alpha phosphorylation. To examine whether these changes were
   present in vivo, isolated aortae from aged WT and S1KO mice were stained
   for calponin. Consistent with our in-vitro findings, the WT mice aortae
   stained higher for calponin relative to S1KO. When exposed to the
   inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, WT vSMCs had an 80\% reduction in
   syndecan-1 expression. Further, with TNF-alpha, S1KO vSMCs produced
   increased pro-inflammatory cytokines relative to WT. Finally, inhibition
   of interactions between syndecan-1 and integrins alpha v beta 3 and
   alpha v beta 5 using the inhibitory peptide synstatin appeared to have
   similar effects on vSMCs as knocking out syndecan-1, with decreased
   expression of vSMC differentiation markers and increased expression of
   inflammatory cytokines, receptors, and osteopontin.
   Conclusions: Taken together, our results support that syndecan-1
   promotes vSMC differentiation and quiescence. Thus, the presence of
   syndecan-1 would have a protective effect against vSMC dedifferentiation
   and this activity is linked to interactions with integrins alpha v beta
   3 and alpha v beta 5.}},

Abstract = {{We report the incorporation of sulfur or iodine into monoclinic tungsten
   trioxide (S:WO3 or I:WO3 respectively), with the aim to improve its
   visible light-harvesting ability. Films were synthesized by spray
   pyrolysis with either ammonium sulfide or iodide added to the aqueous
   WO3 precursor solutions. Red shifts of the absorption spectra were
   observed with S and I incorporation (from similar to 2.7 to 2.6 and 2.1
   eV respectively), likely due to the formation of intragap impurity
   bands. S:WO3 samples exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC)
   performance at low S concentrations, but this quickly deteriorated with
   increasing S content. Incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) data
   showed that this initial improvement was driven by improved collection
   efficiency at longer wavelengths. Conversely, photocurrent decreased at
   all levels of I addition. IPCE measurements for these films showed only
   a marginal increase in efficiency at longer wavelengths, indicating that
   the extra absorbed photons did not contribute significantly to the
   photocurrent. Time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
   depth profiling revealed a uniform distribution of S throughout the
   S:WO3 films, but showed surface segregation of I in the I:WO3 samples.
   Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) showed that S and I
   substituted for oxygen, but in the case of S, other pathways such as
   interstitial incorporation and cation substitution could not be ruled
   out. The complexities of intentionally adding nonmetal impurities to
   metal oxide systems are highlighted in the context of the existing body
   of literature.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of epitaxial c-axis oriented BaTiO3 (BTO)
   on Si(001) using a thin (1.6 nm) buffer layer of SrTiO3 (STO) grown by
   molecular beam epitaxy is reported. The ALD growth of crystalline BTO
   films at 225 degrees C used barium bis(triisopropylcyclopentadienyl),
   titanium tetraisopropoxide, and water as co-reactants. X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) reveals a high degree of crystallinity and c-axis orientation of
   as-deposited BTO films. Crystallinity is improved after vacuum annealing
   at 600 degrees C. Two-dimensional XRD confirms the tetragonal structure
   and orientation of 7-20-nm thick films. The effect of the annealing
   process on the BTO structure is discussed. A clean STO/Si interface is
   found using in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and confirmed by
   cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy. The
   capacitance-voltage characteristics of 7-20nm-thick BTO films are
   examined and show an effective dielectric constant of similar to 660 for
   the heterostructure. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{meta-Aminophenol was used during nucleophilic step copolymerization to
   end-cap partially disulfonated bisphenol A based random copolymers with
   controlled oligomeric molecular weights. The amine end groups were
   thermally reacted with a tetrafunctional epoxy reagent to produce
   networks. Very high gel fractions, up to 99\%, and ductile film
   formation were achieved. The oligomer was further functionalized with
   acryloyl chloride, phenylethynyl phthalic anhydride, and maleic
   anhydride to obtain several novel free radically cross-linkable
   oligomers. The structure and molecular weights (M-n) were established
   with H-1 NMR spectroscopy of the oligomers and end groups. TGA analysis
   demonstrated the high thermal stability of these oligomers; DSC
   investigations showed that the oligomers had curing exotherms from 140
   to 330 degrees C and that residual casting solvent during cross-linking
   was necessary to avoid vitrification during membrane formation. In
   addition to the thermally cross-linkable systems, photocross-linking was
   demonstrated with the telechelic acrylamide functionalized oligomers.
   Two compositions were identified as potential candidates for further
   development. Cross-linking disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)
   copolymers limits the high water sorption and swelling of these
   hydrophilic materials, which enhances several properties for membrane
   applications. Initial transport results indicate that cross-linking
   greatly reduces salt permeability while modestly decreasing water
   permeability, resulting in improved water/NaCl selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Reaching the goal of economical photoelectrochemical (PEC) water
   splitting will likely require the combination of efficient solar
   absorbers with high activity electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and
   oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Toward this goal, we
   synthesized an amorphous FeOOH (a-FeOOH) phase that has not previously
   been studied as an OER catalyst. The a-FeOOH films show activity
   comparable to that of another OER cocatalyst, Co-borate (Co-B-i), in 1 M
   Na2CO3, reaching 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of similar to 550 mV
   for 10 nm thick films. Additionally, the a-FeOOH thin films absorb less
   than 3\% of the solar photons (AM1.5G) with energy greater than 1.9 eV,
   are homogeneous over large areas, and act as a protective layer
   separating the solution from the solar absorber. The utility of a-FeOOH
   in a realistic system is tested by depositing on amorphous Si triple
   junction solar cells with a photovoltaic efficiency of 6.8\%. The
   resulting a-FeOOH/a-Si devices achieve a total water splitting
   efficiency of 4.3\% at 0 V vs RHE in a three-electrode configuration and
   show no decrease in efficiency over the course of 4 h.}},

Abstract = {{We apply a real-space pseudopotential formalism for charged
   one-dimensional periodic systems to examine the binding energies of P
   dopants in Ge{[}110] nanowires with varying periodicities and diameters.
   Binding energies calculated by density functional quasiparticle energies
   of the neutral dopant are severely underestimated whereas those
   calculated by quasiparticle energies of the ionized defect are
   overestimated. We find the best method for determining binding energies
   is to adopt a composite approach that evaluates the total energy
   difference between charged and neutral systems for the ionization energy
   of the P dopant, but uses the quasiparticle energy for the electron
   affinity of the pure Ge nanowire. Our formalism offers a simple density
   functional method for calculating dopant binding energies of small
   nanowire systems without the use of computationally intensive many-body
   perturbation theory calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying air pollutants that pose potential adverse health exposures
   in retail stores will facilitate exposure mitigation. Assessing the role
   of ventilation in mitigating this exposure is important to understand
   the energy implications of maintaining acceptable indoor air quality. In
   this work, we summarize results from 28 papers that report ventilation
   rates and/or pollutant concentrations in retail stores. These results
   were compared to available standards as well as data collected in
   non-retail environments. The findings of this review are: (1) half of
   the stores tested met/exceeded ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 (ASHRAE 2010a;
   or California Code of Regulations Title 24-2010) for ventilation; (2)
   PM2.5, acrolein, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde exceeded their
   established, most conservative limits/reference exposures for a few of
   the stores tested in the United States, and outside the United States,
   researchers reported PM10, benzene, and trichloroethylene as additional
   pollutants found at concentrations that exceeded their limits; (3)
   alternative control methods would be more effective, and possibly more
   economical, than ventilation; (4) meeting or exceeding the ventilation
   requirements does not necessarily negate the presence of pollutants
   above their suggested limits; and (5) using
   disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) as a metric of disease burden, two
   pollutants were identified as priority hazards in retail stores: PM2.5
   and acrolein. Control strategies should focus on decreasing exposure of
   retail employees to these pollutants generated indoors or infiltrated
   from outdoors.}},

Abstract = {{High-frequency performance of graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs)
   has been limited largely by parasitic resistances, including contact
   resistance (R-C) and access resistance (R-A). Measurement of
   short-channel (500 nm) GFETs with short (200 nm) spin-on-doped
   source/drain access regions reveals negligible change in transit
   frequency (f(T)) after doping, as compared to similar to 23\% f(T)
   improvement for similarly sized undoped GFETs measured at low
   temperature, underscoring the impact of R-C on high-frequency
   performance. DC measurements of undoped/doped short and long-channel
   GFETs highlight the increasing impact of R-A for larger GFETs.
   Additionally, parasitic capacitances were minimized by device
   fabrication using graphene transferred onto low-capacitance quartz
   substrates. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Hypervelocity gouging occurs in high speed sliding systems such as
   rocket sled test tracks, light gas guns, and electromagnetic railguns.
   Gouging takes the form of teardrop-shaped craters on the rail surface,
   and occurs above a threshold speed which is dependent on the slider and
   rail materials. In this study, gouging of aluminum railgun armatures on
   flat and indented copper rails was performed to examine the effect of
   macroscopic surface defects on gouge onset velocity and morphology. Both
   galling and gouge craters were shown to initiate at existing macroscopic
   and microscopic defects. Macroscopically flat rail surfaces provide no
   practical advantage over indented surfaces insofar as gouge onset
   velocity is concerned. However, the shape of the resulting gouge craters
   can be significantly affected. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A 16-element optical phased array integrated on chip is presented for
   achieving two-dimensional (2D) optical beam steering. The device is
   fabricated on the silicon-on-insulator platform with a 250 nm silicon
   device layer. Steering is achieved via a combination of wavelength
   tuning and thermo-optic phase shifting with a switching power of P-pi =
   20 mW per channel. Using a silicon waveguide grating with a
   polycrystalline silicon overlay enables narrow far field beam widths
   while mitigating the precise etching needed for conventional shallow
   etch gratings. Using this system, 2D steering across a 20 degrees x 15
   degrees field of view is achieved with a sidelobe level better than 10
   dB and with beam widths of 1.2 degrees x 0.5 degrees. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{We report mass-producible room-temperature electrically-pumped THz

   by a commercial foundry using metal organic vapor phase epitaxy. A
   dual-stack active region possessing giant optical nonlinearity for 3.5
   THz generation and a non-collinear Cherenkov waveguide THz out-coupling
   scheme is employed. Fabry-Perot devices provided broad emission in the
   3-4 THz range with a peak power of 5 mu W. Single color THz sources were
   processed using surface distributed feedback gratings to produce
   narrowband (< 8 GHz) emission at 3.5 THz with nearly 40 mu W of peak
   power and a mid-infrared-to-THz conversion efficiency of 0.36 mW/W-2. To
   better understand the dynamics of the DFG process, time gated spectral
   measurements of the mid-infrared pumps were performed and simultaneous
   lasing over the duration of the applied bias pulse was observed, thereby
   resulting in efficient difference frequency generation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{452}},
Pages = {{171-183}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The surfaces of polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes were modified with
   polydopamine and poly dopamine-g-poly(ethylene glycol) hydrophilic
   coatings. Unmodified and modified membranes were challenged with a
   soybean oil emulsion feed at six different permeate fluxes in constant
   flux crossflow filtration fouling studies. The threshold flux was
   determined for each membrane. Above the threshold Flux, modified
   membranes generally exhibited lower transmembrane pressures than
   unmodified membranes. However, below the threshold flux, modified
   membranes had higher transmembrane pressures than unmodified membranes,
   likely due to a decrease in performance resulting from the surface
   modification. To account for this difference in permeance,
   polydopamine-g-poly(ethylene glycol) modified membranes were compared to
   membranes with a thicker polydopamine coating and to an unmodified
   membrane with a smaller pore size than that used for the surface
   modified membranes; in this way, all three membranes had similar pure
   water permeances. In this case, the unmodified membrane exhibited a much
   higher transmembrane pressure during fouling than the modified
   membranes, so when membranes of the same permeance are compared, the
   surface modifications improved fouling resistance. Therefore, a
   potential strategy to achieve fouling resistance in a membrane of a
   desired flux and rejection is to modify the surface of a more permeable
   (and perhaps lower rejection) membrane, thereby making the resulting
   modified membrane fouling-resistant but leaving it with the desired flux
   and rejection characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights

Abstract = {{Commonly used techniques for cleaning copper substrates before graphene
   growth via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), such as rinsing with
   acetone, nitric, and acetic acid, and high temperature hydrogen
   annealing still leave residual adventitious carbon on the copper
   surface. This residual carbon promotes graphene nucleation and leads to
   higher nucleation density. We find that copper with an oxidized surface
   can act as a self-cleaning substrate for graphene growth by CVD. Under
   vacuum conditions, copper oxide thermally decomposes, releasing oxygen
   from the substrate surface. The released oxygen reacts with the carbon
   residues on the copper surface and forms volatile carbon monoxide and
   carbon dioxide, leaving a clean copper surface free of carbon for
   large-area graphene growth. Using oxidized electropolished copper foil
   leads to a reduction in graphene nucleation density by over a factor of
   1000 when compared to using chemically cleaned oxygen free copper foil.}},

   periodicities L-0 = 18 and 22 nm and
   poly(styrene-block-methyltrimethylsilylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PTMSM) with

Abstract = {{Evolutionary innovations often arise from complex genetic and ecological
   interactions, which can make it challenging to understand
   retrospectively how a novel trait arose. In a long-term experiment,
   Escherichia coli gained the ability to use abundant citrate (Cit(+)) in
   the growth medium after similar to 31,500 generations of evolution.
   Exploiting this previously untapped resource was highly beneficial:
   later Cit(+) variants achieve a much higher population density in this
   environment. All Cit(+) individuals share a mutation that activates
   aerobic expression of the citT citrate transporter, but this mutation
   confers only an extremely weak Cit(+) phenotype on its own. To determine
   which of the other >70 mutations in early Cit(+) clones were needed to
   take full advantage of citrate, we developed a recursive genomewide
   recombination and sequencing method (REGRES) and performed genetic
   backcrosses to purge mutations not required for Cit(+) from an evolved
   strain. We discovered a mutation that increased expression of the dctA
   C-4-dicarboxylate transporter greatly enhanced the Cit(+) phenotype
   after it evolved. Surprisingly, strains containing just the citT and
   dctA mutations fully use citrate, indicating that earlier mutations
   thought to have potentiated the initial evolution of Cit+ are not
   required for expression of the refined version of this trait. Instead,
   this metabolic innovation may be contingent on a genetic background, and
   possibly ecological context, that enabled citT mutants to persist among
   competitors long enough to obtain dctA or equivalent mutations that
   conferred an overwhelming advantage. More generally, refinement of an
   emergent trait from a rudimentary form may be crucial to its
   evolutionary success.}},

Abstract = {{Most vaccines confer protection via the elicitation of serum antibodies,
   yet more than 100 y after the discovery of antibodies, the molecular
   composition of the human serum antibody repertoire to an antigen remains
   unknown. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem MS proteomic
   analyses of serum antibodies coupled with next-generation sequencing of
   the V gene repertoire in peripheral B cells, we have delineated the
   human serum IgG and B-cell receptor repertoires following tetanus toxoid
   (TT) booster vaccination. We show that the TT+ serum IgG repertoire
   comprises similar to 100 antibody clonotypes, with three clonotypes
   accounting for >40\% of the response. All 13 recombinant IgGs examined
   bound to vaccine antigen with K-d similar to 10(-8)-10(-10) M. Five of
   13 IgGs recognized the same linear epitope on TT, occluding the binding
   site used by the toxin for cell entry, suggesting a possible explanation
   for the mechanism of protection conferred by the vaccine. Importantly,
   only a small fraction (< 5\%) of peripheral blood plasmablast clonotypes
   (CD3(-)CD14(-)CD19(+)CD27(++)CD38(++)CD20(-)TT(+)) at the peak of the
   response (day 7), and an even smaller fraction of memory B cells, were
   found to encode antibodies that could be detected in the serological
   memory response 9 mo postvaccination. This suggests that only a small
   fraction of responding peripheral B cells give rise to the bone marrow
   long-lived plasma cells responsible for the production of biologically
   relevant amounts of vaccine-specific antibodies (near or above the K-d).
   Collectively, our results reveal the nature and dynamics of the
   serological response to vaccination with direct implications for vaccine
   design and evaluation.}},

Title = {{An effective procedure for sensor variable selection and utilization in
   plasma etching for semiconductor manufacturing}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{20-29}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Plasma etching processes have a potentially large number of sensor
   variables to be utilized, and the number of the sensor variables is
   growing due to advances in real-time sensors. In addition, the sensor
   variables from plasma sensors require additional knowledge about
   plasmas, which becomes a big burden for engineers to utilize them in
   this filed. Thus an effective procedure for sensor variable selection
   with minimum plasma knowledge is needed to develop in plasma etching.
   The integrated squared response (ISR) based sensor variable selection
   method which facilitates collecting and analyzing sensor data at one
   time with regard to manipulated variables (MVs) is suggested in this
   paper. The reference sensor library as well as sensor ranking tables
   constructed on the basis of ISR can give insight into plasma sensors.
   The ISR based sensor variable selection method is incorporated with
   relative gain array (RGA) or non-square relative gain array (NRGA) for
   effective variable selection in building a virtual metrology (VM) system
   to predict critical dimension (CD) in plasma etching. The application of
   the technique introduced in this paper is shown to be effective in the
   CD prediction in plasma etching for a dynamic random access memory
   (DRAM) manufacturing. The procedure for sensor variable selection
   introduced in this paper can be a starting point for various
   sensor-related applications in semiconductor manufacturing. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We report ambipolar field-effect transistors (FETs) consisting of inkjet
   printed semiconductor bilayer heterostructures utilizing semiconducting
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and amorphous zinc tin oxide

   principally in the amorphous oxide layer and hole transport to occur
   exclusively in the SWCNT layer. This results in balanced electron and
   hole mobilities exceeding 2 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at low operating voltages
   (<5V) in air. We further show that the SWCNT-ZTO hybrid ambipolar FETs
   can be integrated into functional inverter circuits that display high
   peak gain (>10). This work provides a pathway for realizing solution
   processable, inkjet printable, large area electronic devices, and

Abstract = {{We show that obliquely incident, transversely magnetic-polarized plane
   waves can be totally transmitted (with zero reflection) through
   epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) bilayers characterized by balanced loss and gain
   with parity-time (PT) symmetry. This tunneling phenomenon is mediated by
   the excitation of a surface wave localized at the interface separating
   the loss and gain regions. We determine the parameter configurations for
   which the phenomenon may occur and, in particular, the relationship
   between the incidence direction and the electrical thickness. We show
   that, below a critical threshold of gain and loss, there always exists a
   tunneling angle which, for moderately thick (wavelength-sized)
   structures, approaches a critical value dictated by the surface-wave
   phase-matching condition. We also investigate the unidirectional
   character of the tunneling phenomenon, as well as the possible onset of
   spontaneous symmetry breaking, typical of PT-symmetric systems. Our
   results constitute an interesting example of a PT-symmetry-induced
   tunneling phenomenon, and may open up intriguing venues in the
   applications of ENZ materials featuring loss and gain.}},

Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Globular proteins contain cavities/voids that play specific roles in
   controlling protein function. Elongated cavities provide migration
   channels for the transport of ions and small molecules to the active
   center of a protein or enzyme. Using Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics
   on fully atomistic protein/water models, a new computational methodology
   is introduced that takes into account the protein's dynamic structure
   and maps all the cavities in and on the surface. To demonstrate its
   utility, the methodology is applied to study cavity structure in
   myoglobin and five of its mutants. Computed cavity and channel size
   distributions reveal significant differences relative to the wild type
   myoglobin. Computer visualization of the channels leading to the heme
   center indicates restricted ligand access for the mutants consistent
   with the existing interpretations. The new methodology provides a
   quantitative measure of cavity structure and distributions and can
   become a valuable tool for the structural characterization of proteins.}},

   caprylamidopropyl betaine, to generate a high hydrophilic lipophilic
   balance. The weak interaction of the NPs with surfactant was quantified
   with contact angle measurements. Emulsions were characterized by static
   light scattering to determine the droplet size distributions, optical
   photography to quantify phase separation due to creaming, and both
   optical and electron microscopy to determine emulsion microstructure.
   The NPs and surfactant acted synergistically to produce finer emulsions
   with a greater stability to coalescence relative to the behavior with
   either NPs or surfactant alone. As a consequence of the weak adsorption
   of the highly hydrophilic surfactant on the anionic NPs along with the
   high critical micelle concentration, an unusually large surfactant
   concentration was available to adsorb at the oil-water interface and
   lower the interfacial tension. The synergy for emulsion formation and
   stabilization for the two amphiphiles was even greater in the case of a
   high-salinity synthetic seawater aqueous phase. Here, higher NP
   adsorption at the oil-water interface was caused by electrostatic
   screening of interactions between (1) NPs and the anionic oil-water
   interface and (2) between the NPs. This greater adsorption as well as
   partial flocculation of the NPs provided a more efficient barrier to
   droplet coalescence.}},

Abstract = {{Geodetic surveys now provide detailed time series maps of anthropogenic
   land subsidence and uplift due to injection and withdrawal of pore
   fluids from the subsurface. A coupled poroelastic model allows the
   integration of geodetic and hydraulic data in a joint inversion and has
   therefore the potential to improve the characterization of the
   subsurface and our ability to monitor pore pressure evolution. We
   formulate a Bayesian inverse problem to infer the lateral permeability
   variation in an aquifer from geodetic and hydraulic data and from prior
   information. We compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the
   posterior permeability distribution and a Gaussian approximation of the
   posterior. Computing the MAP estimate requires the solution of a
   large-scale minimization problem subject to the poroelastic equations,
   for which we propose an efficient Newton-conjugate gradient optimization
   algorithm. The covariance matrix of the Gaussian approximation of the
   posterior is given by the inverse Hessian of the log posterior, which we
   construct by exploiting low-rank properties of the data misfit Hessian.
   First and second derivatives are computed using adjoints of the
   time-dependent poroelastic equations, allowing us to fully exploit
   transient data. Using three increasingly complex model problems, we find
   the following general properties of poroelastic inversions: Augmenting
   standard hydraulic well data by surface deformation data improves the
   aquifer characterization. Surface deformation contributes the most in
   shallow aquifers but provides useful information even for the
   characterization of aquifers down to 1 km. In general, it is more
   difficult to infer high-permeability regions, and their characterization
   requires frequent measurement to resolve the associated short-response
   timescales. In horizontal aquifers, the vertical component of the
   surface deformation provides a smoothed image of the pressure
   distribution in the aquifer. Provided that the mechanical properties are
   known, coupled poroelastic inversion is therefore a promising approach
   to detect flow barriers and to monitor pore pressure evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The city of Christchurch and the surrounding region on the South Island
   of New Zealand are underlain by large areas of recent alluvial sediments
   and fills that are highly susceptible to liquefaction and seismic ground
   failure. Thus, the widespread liquefaction that occurred following the
   successive large-scale earthquakes, with moment magnitudes (M-W) ranging
   from 6.0 to 7.1 that struck the Canterbury region in 2010-2011 was
   expected. Prior to the series of earthquakes, soil improvement had been
   used at several sites to mitigate the anticipated damage. This paper
   reviews the performance of improved sites during the Canterbury
   earthquake sequence. The existing soil conditions at each site and the
   design of the ground improvement are discussed, together with
   descriptions of the post-earthquake damage observed. Moreover,
   liquefaction assessment within and surrounding a selection of the ground
   improvement zones is presented.}},

Abstract = {{From late-2010 to mid-2011, Christchurch suffered a series of
   earthquakes and aftershocks that affected the city's power supply. The
   most relevant of these events occurred on 4 September 2010, 22 February
   2011, and 13 June 2011. In all these events transmission level power
   restoration occurred rapidly within one day. Except for the second
   event, similar relatively minor damage led to rapid restoration of
   distribution-level power outages. However, extensive damage to
   underground cables during the February 2011 earthquake caused some
   outages that lasted until early March. This damage seems to be amongst
   the only extensively-documented such failures to date. Despite recorded
   strong ground shakings, damage to other power infrastructure facilities
   was moderate to minor. This satisfactory performance of power
   infrastructure is attributed to a program implemented during the decade
   prior to this earthquake sequence to seismically upgrade almost all
   unreinforced masonry substation buildings and reinforce other
   infrastructure elements.}},

Abstract = {{Telecommunication systems generally performed better than other
   lifelines in the Christchurch-area earthquake sequence of 2010-2011;
   however, various service interruptions were a major concern for
   subscribers. Power disruption was the primary reason for service
   interruption in Christchurch, as has been similarly observed in many
   other major earthquakes around the world. Extensive ground failures
   impacted underground cabling, while Central Offices (COs) sustained
   minor damage due to strong shaking. Closure of the Central Business
   District and increased call volumes created additional strain on
   telecommunication service providers to deal with emergency response.
   This paper presents the findings of the post-earthquake lifeline
   performance investigations of both the landline network and the cellular
   network. Voice and data services of these networks are examined and
   commented based on the findings. The authors' view of rendering the
   telecommunication systems more resilient is presented (Eidinger and Tang

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Single-ISA heterogeneous chip multiprocessor (CMP) is not only an
   attractive design paradigm but also is expected to occur as a
   consequence of manufacturing imperfections, such as process variation
   and permanent faults. Process variation could cause cores to have
   different maximum frequencies; whereas permanent faults could cause
   losses of functional units and/or cache banks randomly distributed on
   cores, resulting in fine-grained heterogeneous CMPs. Hence, application
   schedulers for CMPs need to be aware of such heterogeneity to avoid
   pathological scheduling decisions. However, existing heterogeneity-aware
   scheduling schemes rely on either trial runs or offline profiled
   information to schedule the applications, which incur significant
   performance degradation and are impractical to implement. This paper
   presents a dynamic and predictive application scheduler for single-ISA
   heterogeneous CMPs. It uses a set of hardware-efficient online profilers
   and an analytical performance model to simultaneously predict the
   applications performance on different cores. Based on the predicted
   performance, the scheduler identifies and enforces near-optimal
   application assignment for each scheduling interval without any trial
   runs or offline profiling. We demonstrate that, using only a few
   kilo-bytes of extra hardware, the proposed heterogeneity-aware scheduler
   improves the system throughput by an average of 20.8 percent and the
   weighted speedup by 11.3 percent compared with the commodity OpenSolaris
   scheduler. Compared with the best known research scheduler, the proposed
   scheduler also improves the throughput by 11.4 percent and the weighted

Abstract = {{Correlation between blood pressure (BP) target organ damage,
   cardiovascular risk, and long-term prognosis is greater for ambulatory
   monitored (ABPM) than daytime inclinic measurements. Additionally,
   consistent evidence of numerous studies substantiates the
   ABPM-determined asleep BP mean is an independent and stronger predictor
   of risk and incidence of end-organ injury and cardiovascular events than
   the awake or 24-h means. Hence, cost-effective control of sleep-time BP
   is of great clinical relevance. Ingestion time, according to circadian
   rhythms, of hypertension medications of six different classes and their
   combinations significantly impacts beneficial and/or adverse effects.
   For example, because the high-amplitude circadian rhythm of the
   reninangiotensin-aldosterone system activates during nighttime sleep,
   bedtime versus morning ingestion of angiotensinconverting enzyme
   inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers better controls the asleep
   than awake BP means, with additional benefit independent of terminal
   half-life of converting the 24-h BP profile into more normal dipper
   patterning. Recent findings authenticate therapeutic reduction of
   sleep-time BP, best achieved when the full daily dose of >= 1
   hypertension medications is routinely ingested at bedtime, is the most
   significant independent predictor of lowered cardiovascular and
   cerebrovascular risk.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports about a real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) of a

   three-story, three-bay frame is numerically modeled with
   flexibility-based/layered nonlinear elements and over 400 degrees of
   freedom (DOFs), while one of the nonductile base columns is physically
   tested in the laboratory. RTHS is enabled through a new code developed
   by the authors, and these simulation results are compared with those
   obtained from the ST test. The comparison between ST tests and RTHS is
   encouraging, though still not acceptable (within 10\%). Details of the
   simulation are provided, and preliminary results indicate that RTHS may
   be indeed provide the natural path for a gradual substitution of
   physical (and expensive) testing by numerical simulation. This
   contribution offers a small step in that direction.}},

Title = {{3D multifunctional integumentary membranes for spatiotemporal cardiac
   measurements and stimulation across the entire epicardium}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Means for high-density multiparametric physiological mapping and
   stimulation are critically important in both basic and clinical
   cardiology. Current conformal electronic systems are essentially 2D
   sheets, which cannot cover the full epicardial surface or maintain
   reliable contact for chronic use without sutures or adhesives. Here we
   create 3D elastic membranes shaped precisely to match the epicardium of
   the heart via the use of 3D printing, as a platform for deformable
   arrays of multifunctional sensors, electronic and optoelectronic
   components. Such integumentary devices completely envelop the heart, in
   a form-fitting manner, and possess inherent elasticity, providing a
   mechanically stable biotic/abiotic interface during normal cardiac
   cycles. Component examples range from actuators for electrical, thermal
   and optical stimulation, to sensors for pH, temperature and mechanical
   strain. The semiconductor materials include silicon, gallium arsenide
   and gallium nitride, co-integrated with metals, metal oxides and
   polymers, to provide these and other operational capabilities. Ex vivo
   physiological experiments demonstrate various functions and
   methodological possibilities for cardiac research and therapy.}},

Title = {{Insights Into Regional Adaptations in the Growing Pulmonary Artery Using
   a Meso-Scale Structural Model: Effects of Ascending Aorta Impingement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{As the next step in our investigations into the structural adaptations
   of the main pulmonary artery (PA) during postnatal growth, we utilized
   the extensive experimental measurements of the growing ovine PA from our
   previous study (Fata et al., 2013, ``Estimated in vivo Postnatal Surface
   Growth Patterns of the Ovine Main Pulmonary Artery and Ascending
   Aorta,{''} J. Biomech. Eng., 135(7), pp. 71010-71012). to develop a
   structural constitutive model for the PA wall tissue. Novel to the
   present approach was the treatment of the elastin network as a
   distributed fiber network rather than a continuum phase. We then
   utilized this model to delineate structure-function differences in the
   PA wall at the juvenile and adult stages. Overall, the predicted elastin
   moduli exhibited minor differences remained largely unchanged with age
   and region (in the range of 150 to 200 kPa). Similarly, the predicted
   collagen moduli ranged from similar to 1,600 to 2700 kPa in the four
   regions studied in the juvenile state. Interestingly, we found for the
   medial region that the elastin and collagen fiber splay underwent
   opposite changes (collagen standard deviation juvenile = 17 deg to adult
   = 28 deg, elastin standard deviation juvenile 35 deg to adult = 27 deg),
   along with a trend towards more rapid collagen fiber strain recruitment
   with age, along with a drop in collagen fiber moduli, which went from
   2700 kPa for the juvenile stage to 746 kPa in the adult. These changes
   were likely due to the previously observed impingement of the relatively
   stiff ascending aorta on the growing PA medial region. Intuitively, the
   effects of the local impingement would be to lower the local wall
   stress, consistent with the observed parallel decrease in collagen
   modulus. These results suggest that during the postnatal somatic growth
   period local stresses can substantially modulate regional tissue
   microstructure and mechanical behaviors in the PA. We further underscore
   that our previous studies indicated an increase in effective PA wall
   stress with postnatal maturation. When taken together with the fact that
   the observed changes in mechanical behavior and structure in the growing
   PA wall were modest in the other three regions studied, our collective
   results suggest that the majority of the growing PA wall is subjected to
   increasing stress levels with age without undergoing major structural
   adaptations. This observation is contrary to the accepted theory of
   maintenance of homeostatic stress levels in the regulation of vascular
   function, and suggests alternative mechanisms might regulate postnatal
   somatic growth. Understanding the underlying mechanisms will help to
   improve our understanding of congenital defects of the PA and lay the
   basis for functional duplication in their repair and replacement.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of asphalt binders strongly influence the overall
   mechanical response of asphalt mixture composites. A thorough
   understanding of the mechanistic behavior of asphalt binders is
   important in order to fully and accurately characterize the behavior of
   the asphalt mixture. The mechanical properties of the asphalt binder,
   the matrix in the asphalt mixture composite, are time and temperature
   dependent and have a lower stiffness compared to the inclusions
   (aggregate particles). However, computational methods used to model the
   micromechanics of asphalt mixtures typically assume a constant bulk
   modulus or Poisson's ratio for asphalt binders. This research
   investigates the time-dependence of the bulk modulus of asphalt binders.
   Several approaches for measuring the bulk modulus were explored and the
   poker-chip geometry was found to be the most suitable one. The boundary
   value problem for the poker-chip geometry was solved to determine the
   bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio of asphalt binders as a function of
   time. The findings from this research improve our understanding of the
   viscoelastic behavior of asphaltic materials, and also guide important
   assumptions that are typically made during computational modeling of
   asphaltic materials.}},

   Electricity: A Case Study of the Energy-Water Nexus in Texas}},

Abstract = {{Growing populations and periodic drought conditions have exacerbated
   water stress in many areas worldwide. In response, some municipalities
   have considered desalination of saline water as a freshwater supply.
   Unfortunately, desalination requires a sizeable energy investment.
   However, renewable energy technologies can be paired with desalination
   to mitigate concern over the environmental impacts of increased energy
   use. At the same time, desalination can be operated in an intermittent
   way to match the variable availability of renewable resources.
   Integrating wind power and brackish groundwater desalination generates a
   high-value product (drinking water) from low-value resources (saline
   water and wind power without storage). This paper presents a
   geographically-resolved performance and economic method that estimates
   the energy requirements and profitability of an integrated wind-powered
   reverse osmosis facility treating brackish groundwater. It is based on a
   model that incorporates prevailing natural and market conditions such as
   average wind speeds, total dissolved solids content, brackish well
   depth, desalination treatment capacity, capital and operation costs of
   wind and desalination facilities, brine disposal costs, and electricity
   and water prices into its calculation. The model is illustrated using
   conditions in Texas (where there are counties with significant
   co-location of wind and brackish water resources). Results from this
   case study indicate that integrating wind turbines and brackish water
   reverse osmosis (BWRO) systems is economically favorable in a few
   municipal locations in West Texas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper has two objectives: 1) to describe the experimental and data
   collection methods for a large-scale smart grid deployment in Austin,
   Texas, and 2) to provide results based on those data. As of October
   2012, the test bed was comprised of I) 250 homes concentrated in a
   single neighborhood all built after 2007, and 2) 160 homes distributed
   throughout Austin with ages ranging from 10 to 92 years old. This
   experiment includes 200 electric monitoring systems (15-s resolution),
   211 electric monitoring systems (1-min), 182 gas meters (2-cubic foot),
   and 51 water meters (1 gallon) and many of the monitored homes also have
   energy audits and homeowner surveys. The test bed also includes 185
   rooftop PV (photovoltaic) installations and 50 electric vehicles in the
   same neighborhood. Data streams were automated and gathered at a
   supercomputing facility at UT-Austin yielding 250 GB (2.95 x 10(9)
   records) of data in the first year. This paper describes the baseline
   study and monitoring methods, characterizes the study participants, and
   provides some first results about residential energy use. These results
   include a negative correlation between energy use and knowledge about
   energy as well as a possible positive correlation between energy use and
   some rebates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the theory of scaling criteria, a physical experimental model

   similarity, dynamic similarity and characteristic parameters similarity
   was designed. The factors affecting fluid flow and water flooding
   characteristics, and the EOR features of different displacing modes were
   studied by experiments. The experimental results show that: Oil and
   water displacement effect caused by the density difference between oil
   and water is the main mechanism of water flooding; Injection rate has no
   effect on the remaining oil and water-cut; Fracture-vuggy connection is
   the dominant factor controlling water-free recovery, ultimate limit of
   remaining oil and water-cut variation in the fractured-vuggy cell;
   Oil-water viscosity ratio has an important effect on oil production
   rate, oil replacement ratio and economic limit remaining oil; When the
   filling degree is low, it has no effect on remaining oil, but when the
   filling degree is high, the remaining oil contains both ``attic oil{''}
   and the oil existing in porous media; Foam flooding after water flooding
   enhances oil recovery by starting the attic oil at the top of vugs, and
   the remaining oil is in the center of the vugs after foam flooding;
   Polymer flooding after water flooding enhances the economic limit
   recovery by increasing the oil production rate and oil draining ratio,
   but it has no effect on the limit remaining oil of water flooding.}},

Abstract = {{The electrocatalytic activity of the spinel oxide LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 with
   different morphologies (cubic, spherical, octahedral, and truncated
   octahedral) has been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction
   (OER) in alkaline solutions that is of interest for metal-air batteries.
   The OER activity increases in the order truncated octahedral < cubic <
   spherical < octahedral, despite a larger surface area (2.9 m(2) g(-1))
   for the spherical sample compared to nearly similar surface areas
   (0.3-0.7 m(2) g(-1)) for the other three samples. The high activity of
   the octahedral sample is attributed to the regular octahedral shape with
   low-energy \{111\} surface planes, whereas the lowest activity of the
   truncated octahedral sample is attributed to the high-energy \{001\}
   surface planes. The octahedral sample also exhibits the lowest Tafel
   slope of 70 mV dec(-1) with the highest durability whereas the truncated
   octahedral sample exhibits the highest Tafel slope of 120 mV dec(-1)
   with durability similar to the cubic and spherical samples. The study
   demonstrates that the catalytic activities of oxide catalysts could be
   tuned and optimized by controlling the surface morphologies/planes via
   novel synthesis approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Serious concerns have been recently raised about the reliability of the
   siliconepolyurethane copolymer (Optim) lead insulation system. We sought
   to identify insulation defects and Optim-lead failures by systematic
   fluoroscopic and electrical assessment in a prospectively defined cohort
   of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patients.
   Between July 2007 and December 2011, 234 patients were implanted with
   413 optim-coated leads as part of an ICD system at a single centre.
   Fluoroscopic screening with high-resolution cine-fluoroscopy at 30
   frames per second was offered to all patients. In addition, the
   electrical integrity of all implanted leads was assessed. Durata, Riata
   ST Optim, and low-voltage Optim leads were implanted in 199, 26, and 188
   cases, respectively. During a total follow-up of 10 036 lead-months,
   there were 7 Optim-lead failures (defined as electrical malfunction
   resulting in lead replacement) and 31 deaths; no cases of electrical
   noises were encountered. The overall incidence of lead failure was 1.2
   vs. 0.3 per 100 lead-years, for high- and low-voltage leads,
   respectively (P 0.1). One hundred fifty-one patients agreed to undergo
   fluoroscopy screening; none of the 264 analysed Optim leads were found
   to have any fluoroscopically visible structural defects after an average
   of 31 months post-implant.
   This study represents the first systematic screening of Optim-coated
   leads in a large unselected cohort of ICD patients. Over a 5-year period
   few lead failures were observed and normal fluoroscopic appearance was
   present in all patients.}},

   balanced 3-D block decomposition of the scattering volume is used to
   parallelize the correction step. The scalability of the proposed
   parallelization method is investigated theoretically. To compare it with
   competing methods, the concepts of resource constraints, parallel
   efficiency constraints, scalability limits, and acceptable
   parallelization regions are introduced by using N - P plots, where N and
   P denote the number of unknowns and processes, respectively. Using these
   concepts, it is shown that the proposed parallelization of AIM has
   better weak and strong scalability compared to the traditional ones,
   i.e., it enables not only larger problems to be solved but also faster
   solution of a given problem by increasing P.}},

Abstract = {{The parallelization of the adaptive integral method proposed in Part I
   is used to solve 3-D scattering problems pertinent to bioelectromagnetic
   (BIOEM) analysis. Detailed numerical results are presented to quantify
   the computational complexity and parallel efficiency of the method on a
   petascale supercomputing cluster. Boundaries of acceptable
   parallelization regions of the method are identified in the N - P plane
   under realistic resource and efficiency constraints, where N and P
   denote the number of unknowns and processes, respectively. These regions
   are shown to be larger than those of an alternative parallelization
   method for benchmark BIOEM problems. The proposed method is also used to
   compute the power absorbed by an anatomical human body model to
   demonstrate its potential for solving complex BIOEM problems. The
   computations are performed for increasingly higher resolutions of the
   model and the power absorbed by the entire model and specific tissues in
   it are compared to safety standards. The highest resolution body model
   leads to an extreme problem with about 1.2 billion unknowns; the
   absolute parallel efficiency of the power-absorption simulation with
   this model is shown to be approximately 78\% for matrix fill operations,
   66\% for memory requirement, and 30\% for iterative solution on 8192

   backscattering data from several structures of interest, including a

Title = {{Reducing the Error Accumulation in Car-Following Models Calibrated With

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{148-157}},

Abstract = {{With the development of probe vehicle technologies and the emerging
   connected vehicle technologies, applications and models using trajectory
   data for calibration and validation significantly increase. However, the
   error accumulation issue accompanied by the calibration process has not
   been fully investigated and addressed. This paper explores the mechanism
   and countermeasures of the error accumulation problems of car-following
   models calibrated with microscopic vehicle trajectory data. In this
   paper, we first derive the error dynamic model based on an
   acceleration-based generic car-following model formulation. The
   stability conditions for the error dynamic model are found to be
   different from the model stability conditions. Therefore, adjusting
   feasible ranges of model parameters in the car-following model
   calibration to ensure model stability cannot guarantee the error
   stability. However, directly enforcing those error stability conditions
   can be ineffective, particularly when explicit formulations are
   difficult to obtain. To overcome this issue, we propose several
   countermeasures that incorporate error accumulation indicators into the
   error measures used in the calibration. Numerical experiments are
   conducted to compare the traditional and the proposed error measures
   through the calibration of five representative car-following models,
   i.e., General Motors, Bando, Gipps, FREeway SIMulation (FRESIM), and
   intelligent driver model (IDM) models, using field trajectory data. The
   results indicate that the weighted location mean absolute error (MAE)
   and the location MAE with crash rate penalty can achieve the best
   overall error accumulation performance for all five models. Meanwhile,
   traditional error measures, velocity MAE, and velocity Theil's U also
   achieve satisfactory error accumulation performance for FRESIM and IDM
   models, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The observability analysis of a collaborative opportunistic navigation
   (COpNav) environment whose states may be partially known is considered.
   A COpNav environment can be thought of as a radio frequency (RF) signal
   landscape within which one or more RF receivers locate themselves in
   space and time by extracting and, possibly, sharing information from
   ambient signals of opportunity (SOPs). These receivers, whether vehicle
   mounted or integrated into handheld devices, exploit signal diversity to
   improve navigation and timing robustness compared with stand-alone
   Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers in deep urban, indoor, or,
   otherwise, GPS-hostile environments. Available SOPs may have a fully
   known, partially known, or unknown characterization. In this paper, the
   receivers are assumed to draw only pseudorange-type measurements from
   the SOPs. Separate observations are fused to produce an estimate of each
   receiver's position, velocity, and time (PVT). Since not all SOP states
   in the COpNav environment may be known a priori, the receivers must
   estimate the unknown SOP states of interest simultaneously with their
   own PVT. This paper establishes the minimal conditions under which a
   COpNav environment consisting of multiple receivers and multiple SOPs is
   completely observable. Moreover, in scenarios where the COpNav
   environment is unobservable, the unobservable directions in the state
   space are specified. Simulation and experimental results are presented
   to confirm the theoretical observability conditions.}},

Abstract = {{An envelope-tracking hybrid field-circuit simulator is proposed for
   efficiently analyzing narrowband scattering from wire antennas loaded
   with nonlinear devices. The simulator models the interactions of fields
   with wires and lumped elements by coupling and simultaneously solving
   the thin-wire electric field integral equation and Kirchhoff's
   equations, respectively. The coupled nonlinear system of equations is
   iteratively solved by a time marching scheme that represents the fields,
   voltages, and currents of interest (signals) as a truncated series of
   harmonic sinusoids (carriers) multiplied with complex-valued
   time-varying coefficients (envelopes). Unlike time-domain simulators,
   which sample the signals at a rate proportional to their maximum
   frequency content, the proposed envelope-tracking simulator samples the
   envelopes at a rate proportional to their maximum bandwidth; thus, it
   requires significantly fewer time-steps when solving narrowband
   problems. Moreover, the envelope-tracking simulator is generally more
   accurate than its time-domain counterpart because of smaller integration
   and interpolation errors. Numerical results demonstrate that the
   proposed simulator improves the tradeoff between accuracy and
   computation time, especially when analyzing antennas excited by
   narrowband signals or loaded with weakly nonlinear devices.}},

Abstract = {{Gay-Berne anisotropic potential has been widely used to evaluate the
   nonbonded interactions between coarse-grained particles being described
   as elliptical rigid bodies. In this paper, we are presenting a
   coarse-grained model for twenty kinds of amino acids and proteins, based
   on the anisotropic Gay-Berne and point electric multipole (EMP)
   potentials. We demonstrate that the anisotropic coarse-grained model,
   namely GBEMP model, is able to reproduce many key features observed from
   experimental protein structures (Dunbrack Library), as well as from
   atomistic force field simulations (using AMOEBA, AMBER, and CHARMM force
   fields), while saving the computational cost by a factor of about 10-200
   depending on specific cases and atomistic models. More importantly,
   unlike other coarse-grained approaches, our framework is based on the
   fundamental intermolecular forces with explicit treatment of
   electrostatic and repulsion-dispersion forces. As a result, the
   coarse-grained protein model presented an accurate description of
   nonbonded interactions (particularly electrostatic component) between
   hetero/homodimers (such as peptide-peptide, peptide-water). In addition,
   the encouraging performance of the model was reflected by the excellent
   correlation between GBEMP and AMOEBA models in the calculations of the
   dipole moment of peptides. In brief, the GBEMP model given here is
   general and transferable, suitable for simulating complex biomolecular
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to determine the antibody repertoire encoded by B cells in the
   blood or lymphoid organs using high-throughput DNA sequencing
   technologies have been advancing at an extremely rapid pace and are
   transforming our understanding of humoral immune responses. Information
   gained from high-throughput DNA sequencing of immunoglobulin genes
   (Ig-seq) can be applied to detect B-cell malignancies with high
   sensitivity, to discover antibodies specific for antigens of interest,
   to guide vaccine development and to understand autoimmunity. Rapid
   progress in the development of experimental protocols and informatics
   analysis tools is helping to reduce sequencing artifacts, to achieve
   more precise quantification of clonal diversity and to extract the most
   pertinent biological information. That said, broader application of
   Ig-seq, especially in clinical settings, will require the development of
   a standardized experimental design framework that will enable the
   sharing and meta-analysis of sequencing data generated by different
   laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides a noninvasive means to measure
   optical and physiological properties of tissues. To expand on these
   measurements, we have developed a handheld diffuse reflectance spectral
   imaging (DRSi) system capable of acquiring wide field hyperspectral
   images of tissue. The image acquisition time was approximately 50
   seconds for a 50x50 pixel image. A transport model was used to fit each
   spectra for reduced scattering coefficient, hemoglobin concentration and
   melanin concentration resulting in optical property maps. The system was
   validated across biologically relevant levels of reduced scattering
   (5.14\% error) and absorption (8.34\% error) using tissue simulating
   phantoms. DRSi optical property maps of a pigmented skin lesion were
   acquired in vivo. These trends in optical properties were consistent
   with previous observations using point probe devices. (C) 2014 Optical

   multiple rectangular outlets}},
Journal = {{GRANULAR MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{125-132}},

Abstract = {{We present a simulation study on the formation of particle arches
   supported by flying buttresses that arrest the flow of monodisperse
   spherical particles through two adjacent slots (rectangular outlets) in
   a three-dimensional (3D) anisometric flat-bottomed silo discharging
   under gravity. Most previous experimental and simulation studies on the
   jamming of a silo have focused on a single outlet, and have shown that
   the mean number of particles exiting the silo before it jams depends on
   the ratio of outlet size to particle diameter (). In this paper, we look
   at the nature of jamming if there are two adjacent outlets and discover
   some new physical insights on how sand arches are mechanically supported
   and how they interact with each other. For a fixed slot width and
   particle diameter , the distance separating the two openings is varied.
   The distribution of particles exiting the silo before both slots are
   jammed is obtained for each . From these distributions, we show that as
   becomes less than approximately , the particle arches on adjacent
   outlets start affecting each other, and mutually stable arches become
   harder to form. We show that in cases, where for a small orifice ratio a
   single outlet would have easily jammed, two adjacent outlets do not jam.
   We propose that this is due to the importance of stable particles
   resting on the base of the silo adjacent to the arches, which
   redistribute the load much like a flying buttress does in Gothic arches.}},

Abstract = {{Channel statistics based secondary transmission strategy design has been
   studied intensively in the past. In this work, we consider the same
   problem but with a carrier sensing multiple access based primary
   networks, i.e., the primary users that would react to interference. In
   such primary networks, users always need to perform carrier sensing
   before accessing the channel. Such networks include 802.11 WLAN and
   802.15 WPAN. The secondary transmission strategy design when the primary
   network uses carrier sensing based network access differs a lot from
   what has been considered in the literature. Here, we show through
   experiments with 802.11 networks that under secondary interference, the
   primary users can experience not only packet collisions but also
   transmission delay. Under long-term secondary interference, the primary
   users might even choose to transmit in another channel. This phenomenon
   is known as the channel capture effect. Next, with this in mind, we
   formulate a novel transmission strategy design problem that aims to
   maximize secondary transmission time with design constraints on the
   probability of packet collision or delay, as well as the probability
   that the primary user switches channel. Finally, we describe a
   software-defined radio device that we built to execute the designed
   transmission strategies on the 2.4 GHz band. The performance of both the
   primary and secondary users are studied. Results show that our
   consideration for the primary user reactions is necessary. In
   particular, the designed transmission strategy better protects the
   primary user transmission while maintaining secondary user performance.}},

Abstract = {{A lithium-iodine (Li-I-2) cell using the triiodide/iodide (I-3(-)/I-)

Abstract = {{Nitsche's method can be used as a coupling tool for non-matching
   discretizations by weakly enforcing interface constraints. We explore
   the use of weak coupling based on Nitsche's method in the context of
   higher order and higher continuity B-splines and NURBS. We demonstrate
   that weakly coupled spline discretizations do not compromise the
   accuracy of isogeometric analysis. We show that the combination of weak
   coupling with the finite cell method opens the door for a truly
   isogeometric treatment of trimmed B-spline and NURBS geometries that
   eliminates the need for costly reparameterization procedures. We test
   our methodology for several relevant technical problems in two and three
   dimensions, such as gluing together trimmed multi-patches and connecting
   non-matching meshes that contain B-spline basis functions and standard
   triangular finite elements. The results demonstrate that the concept of
   Nitsche based weak coupling in conjunction with the finite cell method
   has the potential to considerably increase the flexibility of the
   design-through-analysis process in isogeometric analysis. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{An isogeometric boundary element method based on T-splines is used to
   simulate acoustic phenomena. We restrict our developments to
   low-frequency problems to establish the fundamental properties of the
   proposed approach. Using T-splines, the computer aided design (CAD) and
   boundary element analysis are integrated without recourse to geometry
   cleanup or mesh generation. A regularized Burton-Miller formulation is
   used resulting in integrals which are at most weakly singular. We employ
   a collocation-based approach to generate the linear system of equations.
   The method is verified against closed-form solutions and direct
   comparisons are made with conventional Lagrangian discretizations. It is
   demonstrated that the superior accuracy of the isogeometric approach
   emanates from the exact geometric description encapsulated in the
   T-spline. The method is then applied to a real-world application to
   illustrate the potential for integrated engineering design and analysis.

Title = {{Efficient Bayesian inference of subsurface flow models using nested

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{An efficient Bayesian calibration method based on the nested sampling
   (NS) algorithm and non-intrusive polynomial chaos method is presented.
   Nested sampling is a Bayesian sampling algorithm that builds a discrete
   representation of the posterior distributions by iteratively re-focusing
   a set of samples to high likelihood regions. NS allows representing the
   posterior probability density function (PDF) with a smaller number of
   samples and reduces the curse of dimensionality effects. The main
   difficulty of the NS algorithm is in the constrained sampling step which
   is commonly performed using a random walk Markov Chain Monte-Carlo
   (MCMC) algorithm. In this work, we perform a two-stage sampling using a
   polynomial chaos response surface to filter out rejected samples in the
   Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method. The combined use of nested sampling and
   the two-stage MCMC based on approximate response surfaces provides
   significant computational gains in terms of the number of simulation
   runs. The proposed algorithm is applied for calibration and model
   selection of subsurface flow models. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The accurate generation and absorption of water waves in phase-resolving
   models are critical issues in representing nearshore processes. Here, we
   present a source function method for combined wave generation and
   absorption using modified sponge layers. This technique can be easily
   adapted to a wide variety of systems, and does not require the solution
   of Green's functions but rather the simpler knowledge of solutions for
   free waves. These solutions may be linear or nonlinear, regular or
   irregular, and generated waves can be made arbitrarily accurate through
   simple selection of sponge layer coefficients. Generating-absorbing
   sponge layer systems are shown to have a close correspondence to
   relaxation zones for wave generation if relaxation coefficients are
   chosen appropriately. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of designing scheduling algorithms for a multichannel (e.g.,
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based) wireless downlink
   network is considered. The classic MaxWeight algorithm, although
   throughput-optimal, results in a very poor per-user delay performance in
   such systems. Hence, an alternate class of algorithms called iterated
   longest queues first (iLQF) is proposed for overcoming this issue. The
   iLQF-class algorithms are analyzed in a number of different system
   configurations. A particular algorithm in this class, called iLQF with
   pullup, is shown to be rate function optimal for the problem in an
   appropriate large deviations setting, and is shown to result in a
   strictly positive value of the rate function for a number of
   modifications to the basic system model. Thus, the proposed algorithm
   yields provable performance guarantees. The analytic results are
   confirmed through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{People experience a variety of 3D visual programs, such as 3D cinema, 3D
   TV and 3D games, making it necessary to deploy reliable methodologies
   for predicting each viewer's subjective experience. We propose a new
   methodology that we call multi-modal interactive continuous scoring of
   quality (MICSQ). MICSQ is composed of a device interaction process
   between the 3D display and a separate device (PC, tablet, etc.) used as
   an assessment tool, and a human interaction process between the
   subject(s) and the separate device. The scoring process is multimodal,
   using aural and tactile cues to help engage and focus the subject(s) on
   their tasks by enhancing neuroplasticity. Recorded human responses to 3D
   visualizations obtained via MICSQ correlate highly with measurements of
   spatial and temporal activity in the 3D video content. We have also
   found that 3D quality of experience (QoE) assessment results obtained
   using MICSQ are more reliable over a wide dynamic range of content than
   obtained by the conventional single stimulus continuous quality
   evaluation (SSCQE) protocol. Moreover, the wireless device interaction
   process makes it possible for multiple subjects to assess 3D QoE
   simultaneously in a large space such as a movie theater, at different
   viewing angles and distances. We conducted a series of interesting 3D
   experiments showing the accuracy and versatility of the new system,
   while yielding new findings on visual comfort in terms of disparity,
   motion and an interesting relation between the naturalness and depth of
   field (DOF) of a stereo camera.}},

Abstract = {{Real-world traffic flow usually contains a mixture of passenger vehicles
   (PV) and heavy vehicles (HV). In this paper, the four types of car truck
   following combinations are considered: the car-following-car case,
   car-following-truck case, truck-following-car case and
   truck-following-truck case. The effect of different combinations on the
   stability of traffic flow is explored by converting the original Bando's
   optimal velocity (OV) model to a heterogeneous form. A new linear
   stability analysis method that can derive the stability criterion of the
   heterogeneous traffic flow mixed by cars and trucks is introduced.
   Moreover, the effect of the proportions of the four car truck following
   combinations on traffic flow is examined through the trajectory
   analysis. It concludes that the linear stability of the car truck mixed
   traffic flow is determined more by the proportions of the different car
   truck following scenarios, rather than the numbers of the cars and
   trucks. Moreover, cars and trucks can both stabilize and destabilize
   traffic flow depending on the density of the traffic flow and the
   parameters of the heterogeneous OV model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of long-term characteristic' loads associated with
   an ultimate limit state for design of a 5-MW bottom-supported offshore
   wind turbine is the focus of this study. Specifically, we focus on
   predicting the long-term fore-aft tower bending moment at the mudline
   and the out-of-plane bending moment at the blade root of a
   monopile-supported shallow-water offshore wind turbine. We employ
   alternative probabilistic predictions of long-term loads using inverse
   reliability procedures in establishing the characteristic loads for
   design. Because load variability depends on the environmental conditions
   (defining the wind speed and wave height), we show that long-term
   predictions that explicitly account for such load variability are more
   accurate, especially for environmental states associated with
   above-rated wind speeds and associated wave heights. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{It is an important task to faithfully evaluate the perceptual quality of
   output images in many applications, such as image compression, image
   restoration, and multimedia streaming. A good image quality assessment
   (IQA) model should not only deliver high quality prediction accuracy,
   but also be computationally efficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is
   becoming particularly important due to the increasing proliferation of
   high-volume visual data in high-speed networks. We present a new
   effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient magnitude similarity
   deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to image
   distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image
   suffer different degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore
   the use of global variation of gradient based local quality map for
   overall image quality prediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient
   magnitude similarity (GMS) between the reference and distorted images
   combined with a novel pooling strategy-the standard deviation of the GMS
   map-can predict accurately perceptual image quality. The resulting GMSD
   algorithm is much faster than most state-of-the-art IQA methods, and
   delivers highly competitive prediction accuracy. MATLAB source code of
   GMSD can be downloaded at http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/similar to

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{151-161}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Turbine inlet cooling (TIC) is a common technology used to increase
   combustion turbine power output and efficiency. The use of mechanical or
   absorption chillers for TIC allows for more air cooling than evaporative
   methods and also imposes a significant parasitic load to the turbine.
   Thermal energy storage (TES) can be used to shift this load to off-peak
   hours. Use of thermal storage increases the flexibility of turbine power
   output, which benefits from the application of optimization tools. This
   paper explores the effect of combining TIC with TES to enhance the
   performance of a district cooling system that includes a gas turbine for
   power generation. The work illustrates how the system's performance can
   be enhanced using optimization. Application of multi-period optimization
   to the system that includes TES brings significant operational cost
   savings when compared with a system without thermal storage. It is also
   shown how TES provides demand-side energy management in the district
   cooling loop and supply-side management through the use of TIC. In
   addition to the optimization study, a thorough literature review is
   included that describes the current body of work on combining TIC with
   TES. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Manifold microchannel heat sink design using optimization under
   uncertainty}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{92-105}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A three-dimensional numerical model is developed and validated to study
   the effect of geometric parameters such as microchannel depth and width,
   manifold depth, and manifold inlet and outlet lengths on the performance
   of a manifold microchannel (MMC) heat sink. The manifold arrangement
   used to distribute the flow through alternating inlet and outlet pairs
   greatly reduces the pressure drop incurred in conventional fluid supply
   arrangements due to its shorter flow paths, while simultaneously
   enhancing the heat transfer coefficient by limiting the growth of
   thermal boundary layers. The computational analysis is performed on a
   simple unit-cell model to obtain an optimized design for uniform thermal
   boundary conditions, as well as on a porous-medium model to obtain a
   complete system-level analysis of multiple microchannels across one
   manifold. The porous-medium approach can be further modified to analyze
   the performance under asymmetrical heating conditions. Along with
   conventional deterministic optimization, a probabilistic optimization
   study is performed to identify the optimal geometric design parameters
   that maximize heat transfer coefficient while minimizing pressure drop
   for an MMC heat sink. In the presence of uncertainties in the geometric
   and operating parameters of the system, this probabilistic optimization
   approach yields a design that is robust and reliable, in addition to
   being optimal. Such an optimization analysis provides a quantitative
   estimate of the allowable uncertainty in input parameters for acceptable
   uncertainties in the relevant output parameters. The approach also
   yields information such as the local and global sensitivities which are
   used to identify microchannel width and manifold inlet length as the
   critical input parameters to which the outputs are most sensitive. The
   deterministic analysis shows that the heat transfer performance of the
   MMC heat sink is optimal at a manifold inlet to outlet length ratio of
   3. A comparison between the deterministic and probabilistic optimization
   approaches is presented for the unit-cell model. A probabilistic
   optimization study is performed for the porous-medium model and the
   results thus obtained are compared with those of the unit-cell model for
   a uniform heat flux distribution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The kinetics of aggregation of silica nanoparticle solutions as a
   function of NaCl and silica concentrations is studied experimentally and
   theoretically. Silica nanoparticles form fractal aggregates due to the
   collapse of the electrical double layer at high salt concentrations and
   resulting reduction in stabilizing repulsive force. We propose a
   convenient model to describe the aggregation of silica nanoparticles and
   the growth of their aggregate size that depends on particle size and
   concentration and salt concentration. The model agrees well with
   experimental data. The aggregation of silica nanoparticles also affects
   the rheology of the suspension. We propose an equilibrium approach for
   sediment volume fraction to determine the maximum effective packing
   fraction. The results for the relative viscosity of silica aggregates
   agree well with the proposed viscosity model, which also collapses onto
   a single master curve.}},

   process. Addressing the need of quantifying the load experienced by a
   typical user, a ``Feller-paradox{''} like relationship is established
   between the area of the association cell containing origin and that of a
   typical association cell. For the specific case of Poisson point process
   and max power/SINR association, the mean association area of each tier
   is derived and shown to increase with channel gain variance and decrease
   in the path loss exponents of the corresponding tier.}},

Abstract = {{Petrophysical rock classification is an important component of the
   interpretation of core data and well logs acquired in complex
   reservoirs. Tight-gas sandstones exhibit large variability in all
   petrophysical properties due to complex pore topology resulting from
   diagenesis. Conventional methods that rely dominantly on hydraulic
   radius to classify and rank reservoir rocks are prone to rock
   misclassification at the low-porosity and low-permeability end of the
   spectrum. We introduce a bimodal Gaussian density function to quantify
   complex pore systems in terms of pore volume, major pore-throat radii,
   and pore-throat radius uniformity. We define petrophysical dissimilarity
   (referred to as orthogonality) between two different pore systems by
   invoking the classic ``bundle of capillary tubes{''} model and
   subsequently classify rocks by clustering an orthogonality matrix
   constructed with all available mercury injection capillary pressure
   data. The new method combines several rock textural attributes including
   porosity, pore-throat radius, and tortuosity for ranking reservoir rock
   quality in terms of flow capacity. We verify the new rock classification
   method with field data acquired in the Cotton Valley tight-gas sandstone
   reservoir located in the East Texas basin. The field case shows that the
   new method consistently identifies and ranks rock classes in various
   petrophysical data domains, including porosity-permeability trends,
   pore-size distribution, mercury injection capillary pressure, and NMR
   transverse relaxation time (T-2) spectra. Relative permeability curves,
   which are difficult to measure in the laboratory for tight rocks, are
   quantified with Corey-Burdine's model using the bimodal Gaussian
   pore-size distribution and are validated with core data.}},

Title = {{Lipid Bilayer Vesicle Generation Using Microfluidic Jetting}},
Journal = {{Jove-Journal of Visualized Experiments}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{84}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Bottom-up synthetic biology presents a novel approach for investigating
   and reconstituting biochemical systems and, potentially, minimal
   organisms. This emerging field engages engineers, chemists, biologists,
   and physicists to design and assemble basic biological components into
   complex, functioning systems from the bottom up. Such bottom-up systems
   could lead to the development of artificial cells for fundamental
   biological inquiries and innovative therapies(1,2). Giant unilamellar
   vesicles (GUVs) can serve as a model platform for synthetic biology due
   to their cell-like membrane structure and size. Microfluidic jetting, or
   microjetting, is a technique that allows for the generation of GUVs with
   controlled size, membrane composition, transmembrane protein
   incorporation, and encapsulation(3). The basic principle of this method
   is the use of multiple, high-frequency fluid pulses generated by a
   piezo-actuated inkjet device to deform a suspended lipid bilayer into a
   GUV. The process is akin to blowing soap bubbles from a soap film. By
   varying the composition of the jetted solution, the composition of the
   encompassing solution, and/or the components included in the bilayer,
   researchers can apply this technique to create customized vesicles. This
   paper describes the procedure to generate simple vesicles from a droplet
   interface bilayer by microjetting.}},

Abstract = {{Flame-based synthesis of nanoparticles is an important chemical process
   used for the manufacturing of metal oxide particles. In this aerosol
   process, nanoparticle precursors are injected into a high-temperature
   flame that causes precursor oxidation, nucleation, and subsequent growth
   of solid particles through a variety of processes. To aid computational
   design of the aerosol process, a large-eddy simulation (LES) based
   computational framework is developed here. A flamelet-based model is
   used to describe both combustion and precursor oxidation. The solid
   phase nanoparticle evolution is described using a bivariate number
   density function (NDF) approach. The high-dimensional NDF transport
   equation is solved using a novel conditional quadrature method of
   moments (CQMOM) approach. Particle phase processes such as
   collision-based aggregation, and temperature-induced sintering are
   included in this description. This LES framework is used to study an
   experimental methane/air flame that used titanium tetrachloride to
   generate titania particles. The simulation results show that the
   evolution process of titania nanoparticles is largely determined by the
   competition between particle aggregation and sintering at downstream
   locations in the reactor. It is shown that the bivariate description
   improves the prediction of particle size characteristics, although the
   large uncertainty in inflow and operating conditions prevent a full
   scale validation. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{258}},

Abstract = {{A Hybrid Nested Sampling (HNS) algorithm is proposed for efficient
   Bayesian model calibration and prior model selection. The proposed
   algorithm combines, Nested Sampling (NS) algorithm, Hybrid Monte Carlo
   (HMC) sampling and gradient estimation using Stochastic Ensemble Method
   (SEM). NS is an efficient sampling algorithm that can be used for
   Bayesian calibration and estimating the Bayesian evidence for prior
   model selection. Nested sampling has the advantage of computational
   feasibility. Within the nested sampling algorithm, a constrained
   sampling step is performed. For this step, we utilize HMC to reduce the
   correlation between successive sampled states. HMC relies on the
   gradient of the logarithm of the posterior distribution, which we
   estimate using a stochastic ensemble method based on an ensemble of
   directional derivatives. SEM only requires forward model runs and the
   simulator is then used as a black box and no adjoint code is needed. The
   developed HNS algorithm is successfully applied for Bayesian calibration
   and prior model selection of several nonlinear subsurface flow problems.

Abstract = {{BeO was investigated as the interface passivation layer (IPL) between a
   high-k dielectric and a III-V compound semiconductor substrate in
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices. One of the critical issues
   facing the fabrication of next generation MOS devices is the
   minimization of damage to the III-V semiconductor substrate during the
   etching of the thin IPL. In this study, atomic layer etching (ALET) was
   investigated for etching of BeO as the IPL on a GaAs substrate to
   control the etch depth precisely and to minimize the damage to the III-V
   semiconductor substrate. By using ALET to etch BeO, which uses BCl3 as
   the adsorption gas for the formation of chloride compounds (Be-Cl and
   BCl-O) and Ar as the desorption gas for the removal of the chloride
   compounds, a self-limited, one-monolayer etch rate of about 0.75
   angstrom/cycle was achieved with no increase of surface roughness and
   without change of surface composition. Moreover, under the BeO ALET
   conditions, which are able to precisely stop etching over the GaAs
   substrate after removing BeO, the exposed GaAs substrate showed surface
   composition and surface roughness similar to those of the as-received
   GaAs substrate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic isolation and nonreciprocal sound transmission are highly
   desirable in many practical scenarios. They may be realized with
   nonlinear or magneto-acoustic effects, but only at the price of high
   power levels and impractically large volumes. In contrast, nonreciprocal
   electromagnetic propagation is commonly achieved based on the Zeeman
   effect, or modal splitting in ferromagnetic atoms induced by a magnetic
   bias. Here, we introduce the acoustic analog of this phenomenon in a
   subwavelength meta-atom consisting of a resonant ring cavity biased by a
   circulating fluid. The resulting angular momentum bias splits the ring's
   azimuthal resonant modes, producing giant acoustic nonreciprocity in a
   compact device. We applied this concept to build a linear, magnetic-free
   circulator for airborne sound waves, observing up to 40-decibel
   nonreciprocal isolation at audible frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Photophysical processes occurring in two-dimensional systems of perylene
   derivatives covalently attached to planar silica surfaces are studied
   using a combination of steady-state and time-resolved measurements.
   Monomeric emission is observed for low fluorophore densities (below 0.15
   nm(-2)). A broad emission feature centered around 530 nm is observed for
   high fluorophore densities (above 0.44 nm(-2)) and is attributed to
   excimer-like emission from partially overlapping perylene moieties. No
   distinct emission feature from the fully relaxed excimer state is
   observed, although the presence of a small fraction of such sites is
   inferred from both steady-state and time-resolved measurements. A
   one-carbon chain is used to anchor the fluorophore to the surface by the
   reaction of perylene-3-methanol with free hydroxyl and strained siloxane
   sites, likely hindering the ability of neighboring molecules to form a
   fully relaxed excimer state. Analysis of fluorescence decay profiles
   indicates energy migration between sites occurs even for low fluorophore
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{Pd-Au bimetallic catalysts have shown potential applications in numerous
   heterogeneous reactions in which hydrogen and CO act as reactants,
   intermediates, or products. A fundamental understanding of the interplay
   between coadsorbed H and CO on the Pd-Au surface is necessary for
   improving the understanding of catalytic performance. In this study, the
   interactions of hydrogen and CO with Pd/Au(111) model surfaces were
   investigated by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and molecular
   beam scattering (MBS) experiments, carried out under ultra-high-vacuum
   conditions. Our results reveal that CO adsorbs competitively on the
   hydrogen-precovered Pd-Au surface, causing surface H adatoms to diffuse
   away from stronger-binding sites (e.g., Pd(111)-like islands) to
   weaker-binding sites (e.g., Pd-Au alloy sites and subsurface), as
   evidenced by a shift of the H-2 desorption feature to lower temperatures
   in TPD measurements. Additionally, evolution of H-2 was observed when a
   CO molecular beam was impinged onto the H-precovered Pd-Au surface,
   providing direct evidence that CO induces recombinative desorption of H
   adatoms. The presence of H adatoms on the Pd-Au surface was found to
   decrease the initial sticking probability of CO during MBS experiments
   but had little influence on CO desorption during subsequent TPD
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{p-Si/W2C photocathodes are synthesized by evaporating tungsten metal in
   an ambient of ethylene gas to form tungsten semicarbide (W2C) thin films
   on top of p-type silicon (p-Si) substrates. As deposited the thin films
   contain crystalline W2C with a bulk W:C atomic ratio of approximately
   2:1. The W2C films demonstrate catalytic activity for the hydrogen
   evolution reaction (HER), and p-Si/W2C photocathodes produce cathodic
   photocurrent at potentials more positive than 0.0 V vs RHE while bare
   p-Si photocathodes do not. The W2C films are an effective support for Pt
   nanoparticles allowing for a considerable reduction in Pt loading.
   p-Si/W2C/Pt photocathodes with Pt nanoparticles achieve photocurrent
   onset potentials and limiting photocurrent densities that are comparable
   to p-Si/Pt photocathodes with Pt loading nine times higher. This makes
   W2C an earth abundant alternative to pure Pt for use as an
   electrocatalyst on photocathodes for the HER.}},

Abstract = {{We show that tri-layer structures combining epsilon-negative and

   photon tunneling phenomena that can discriminate between circularly
   polarized (CP) waves of given handedness impinging from opposite
   directions, or between CP waves with different handedness impinging from

   interpreted in terms of a Fabry-Perot-type resonance, may be utilized to
   design compact optical isolators for CP waves. Within this framework, we
   derive simple analytical conditions and design formulae, and
   quantitatively assess the isolation performance, also taking into

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Minimum mode following algorithms are widely used for saddle point
   searching in chemical and material systems. Common to these algorithms
   is a component to find the minimum curvature mode of the second
   derivative, or Hessian matrix. Several methods, including Lanczos,
   dimer, Rayleigh-Ritz minimization, shifted power iteration, and locally
   optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient, have been proposed for
   this purpose. Each of these methods finds the lowest curvature mode
   iteratively without calculating the Hessian matrix, since the full
   matrix calculation is prohibitively expensive in the high dimensional
   spaces of interest. Here we unify these iterative methods in the same
   theoretical framework using the concept of the Krylov subspace. The
   Lanczos method finds the lowest eigenvalue in a Krylov subspace of
   increasing size, while the other methods search in a smaller subspace
   spanned by the set of previous search directions. We show that these
   smaller subspaces are contained within the Krylov space for which the
   Lanczos method explicitly finds the lowest curvature mode, and hence the
   theoretical efficiency of the minimum mode finding methods are bounded
   by the Lanczos method. Numerical tests demonstrate that the dimer method
   combined with second-order optimizers approaches but does not exceed the
   efficiency of the Lanczos method for minimum mode optimization. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Porous nanotubes comprised of MnO2 nanosheets were fabricated with a

   capacitance in a three-electrode system was 365 F g(-1) at a current
   density of 0.25 A g(-1) with capacitance retention of 90.4\% after 3000
   cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor with porous MnO2 nanotubes as the
   positive electrode and activated graphene as the negative electrode
   yielded an energy density of 22.5 Wh kg(-1) and a maximum power density
   of 146.2 kW kg(-1); these values exceeded those reported for other MnO2
   nanostructures. The supercapacitor performance was correlated with the

Title = {{A Simple Atomic-Level Hydrophobicity Scale Reveals Protein Interfacial

Abstract = {{Many amino acid residue hydrophobicity scales have been created in an
   effort to better understand and rapidly characterize water protein
   interactions based only on protein structure and sequence. There is
   surprisingly low consistency in the ranking of residue hydrophobicity
   between scales, and their ability to provide insightful characterization
   varies substantially across subject proteins. All current scales
   characterize hydrophobicity based on entire amino acid residue units. We
   introduce a simple binary but atomic-level hydrophobicity scale that
   allows for the classification of polar and non-polar moieties within
   single residues, including backbone atoms. This simple scale is first
   shown to capture the anticipated hydrophobic character for those whole
   residues that align in classification among most scales. Examination of
   a set of protein binding interfaces establishes good agreement between
   residue-based and atomic-level descriptions of hydrophobicity for five
   residues, while the remaining residues produce discrepancies. We then
   show that the atomistic scale properly classifies the hydrophobicity of
   functionally important regions where residue-based scales fail. To
   illustrate the utility of the new approach, we show that the
   atomic-level scale rationalizes the hydration of two hydrophobic pockets
   and the presence of a void in a third pocket within a single protein and
   that it appropriately classifies all of the functionally important
   hydrophilic sites within two otherwise hydrophobic pores. We suggest
   that an atomic level of detail is, in general, necessary for the
   reliable depiction of hydrophobicity for all protein surfaces. The
   present formulation can be implemented simply in a manner no more
   complex than current residue-based approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The dynamic structure factor of liquid para-hydrogen and ortho-deuterium
   in corresponding thermodynamic states (T = 20.0 K, n = 21.24 nm(-3)) and
   (T = 23.0 K, n = 24.61 nm(-3)), respectively, has been computed by both
   the Feynman-Kleinert linearized path-integral (FK-LPI) and Ring-Polymer
   Molecular Dynamics (RPMD) methods and compared with Inelastic X Ray
   Scattering spectra. The combined use of computational and experimental
   methods enabled us to reduce experimental uncertainties in the
   determination of the true sample spectrum. Furthermore, the refined
   experimental spectrum of para-hydrogen and ortho-deuterium is
   consistently reproduced by both FK-LPI and RPMD results at momentum
   transfers lower than 12.8 nm(-1). At larger momentum transfers the
   FK-LPI results agree with experiment much better for ortho-deuterium
   than for para-hydrogen. More specifically we found that for k similar to
   20.0 nm(-1) para-hydrogen provides a test case for improved
   approximations to quantum dynamics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A NiSb-Al2O3-C nanocomposite alloy anode has been synthesized by
   high-energy mechanical milling, involving the mechanochemical reduction
   of Sb2O3 by metallic Al and Ni in the presence of acetylene black
   carbon. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm
   the presence of crystalline NiSb and amorphous Al2O3 in the final
   nanocomposite. Transmission electron microscopy analysis shows the
   distribution of nanoscale crystalline NiSb particles in the matrix of
   Al2O3 and carbon. The presence of reinforcing Al2O3 and nanoscale active
   particles give this nanocomposite excellent cycle life with demonstrated
   capacity of 280 mAh g(-1) to 1000 cycles. While the as-synthesized
   sample suffers from low coulombic efficiency of 55\% in the first cycle
   and a large irreversible loss of roughly 350 mAh g(-1),
   post-heat-treatment processes dramatically reduce the irreversible loss
   to 150 mAh g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of 73\%. Combined with good
   rate capability and a tap density of 1.3 g cm(-3), NiSb-Al2O3-C has
   significant potential as an alternative to graphite anodes in Li-ion

Abstract = {{Peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of just over 120\% were
   observed in photovoltaic (PV) devices of CuInSe2 nanocrystals prepared
   with a photonic curing process. The extraction of more than one
   electron/hole pair as a result of the absorption of a single photon can
   occur if multiple excitons are generated and extracted. Multiexciton
   generation (MEG) in the nanocrystal films was substantiated by transient
   absorption spectroscopy. We propose that photonic curing leads to
   sufficient electronic coupling between nanocrystals to enable
   multiexciton extraction under typical solar illumination conditions.
   Under low light conditions, however, the EQE drops significantly,
   indicating that photonic curing-induced ligand desorption creates a
   significant amount of traps in the film that limit the overall power
   conversion efficiency of the device.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, gas separation has become an important step in many
   production process streams and part of final products. Through the use
   of melt co-extrusion and subsequent orientation methods, gas separation
   membranes were produced entirely without the use of solvents, upon which
   current methods are highly dependent. Symmetric three layer membranes
   were produced using poly(ether-block-amide) (PEBA) copolymers, which
   serve as a selective material that exhibits a high CO2 permeability
   relative to O-2. Thin layers of PEBA are supported by a polypropylene
   (PP) layer that is made porous through the use of two methods: (1)
   inorganic fillers or (2) crystal phase transformation. Two membrane
   systems, PEBA/(PP + CaCO3) and PEBA/beta-PP, maintained a high CO2/O-2
   selectivity while exhibiting reduced permeability. Incorporation of an
   annealing step either before or after orientation improves the membrane
   gas flux by 50 to 100\%. The improvement in gas flux was a result of
   either elimination of strain induced crystallinity, which increases the
   selective layer permeability, or improvement of the PP crystal
   structure, which may increase pore size in the porous support layer. (C)

   scattering suppression for each scattering harmonic, providing a tool to
   quantify the performance of furtive sensors, regardless of the applied

   polymers were characterized by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier

   analysis-mass spectrometry, and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. Transport
   properties of the TR membranes were investigated, and effects of the
   linking group and TR conversion rate on the membrane performance were
   discussed. Among the TR polymers studied, those bearing larger linking

   permeability. The membrane permeability to gases increases with TR
   conversion rate and follows the order H-2 > CO2 > O-2 > N-2 > CH4,

Abstract = {{We study resonant tunnelling effects that can occur in trilayer
   structures featuring a dielectric layer sandwiched between two
   magneto-optical(MO)-metal layers. We show that the resonance splitting
   associated with these phenomena can be exploited to enhance Faraday
   rotation at optical frequencies. Our results indicate that, in the
   presence of realistic loss levels, a tri-layer structure of
   subwavelength thickness is capable of yielding sensible (similar to 10
   degrees) Faraday rotation with transmittance levels that are an order of
   magnitude larger than those attainable with a standalone slab of MO
   metal of the same thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation laws in, for example, electromagnetism, solid and fluid
   mechanics, allow an exact discrete representation in terms of line,
   surface and volume integrals. In this paper, we develop high order
   interpolants, from any basis that constitutes a partition of unity,
   which satisfy these integral relations exactly. The resulting gradient,
   curl and divergence conforming spaces have the property that the
   conservation laws become completely independent of the basis functions.
   Hence, they are exactly satisfied at the coarsest level of
   discretization and on arbitrarily curved meshes. As an illustration we
   apply our approach to B-splines and compute a 2D Stokes flow inside a
   lid driven cavity, which displays, amongst others, a point-wise
   divergence-free velocity field. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of film thickness on the thermal rearrangement of an ortho-
   functional polyimide, derived from 2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)
   hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA) and
   3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (NAB), to a polybenzoxazole
   structure was explored over the range from 50 nm to 100 mu m. The rate
   of thermal rearrangement of this ortho-functional polyimide was found to
   be strongly dependent on film thickness. A thin film of 56 rim
   experienced a much more rapid and extensive thermal rearrangement
   process than a thick film of 100 pm as tracked by thermogravimetric
   analysis, TGA. The conversion of the ortho-functional polyimide to
   polybenzoxazole commences at a lower temperature for thinner films than
   for thicker films. isothermal TGA experiments at 370 degrees C showed a
   much larger weight loss, or extent of rearrangement, at a given time for
   thin films compared to thick films. These observations are believed to
   reflect greater chain segmental mobility in the thin films, due to the
   proximity of the free surfaces, and perhaps the reduced diffusional
   resistance for removal of the evolving volatile compounds accompanying
   the rearrangement reaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{380-388}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In a prior paper gas sorption, permeation and diffusion coefficients
   were determined for He, H-2, N-2, O-2, CH4, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and
   C3H8 in PIM-1, a polymer of intrinsic microporosity, at 25 degrees C
   over a range of pressures. Here similar measurements and analyses were
   made at temperatures from 25 to 55 degrees C over a wide range of
   pressure. In all cases, the sorption isotherms were generally consistent
   with the form of the dual-sorption model. For He, H-2, N-2, O-2, CH4 and
   CO2, the effects of plasticization were minimal and the results could be
   effectively analyzed by the dual sorption-dual mobility model, and the
   temperature dependence of the model parameters were analyzed to obtain
   the energetic parameters for the sorption and diffusion processes.
   However, for C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8, plasticization was quite
   significant and temperature dependent; as a result, a similar analysis
   in terms of the dual sorption-dual mobility model could not be
   meaningfully carried out. For all gases, a more phenomenological
   analysis of P, D and S was made in terms of simple Arrhenius and van't
   Hoff relations to obtain energetic parameters that subsequently depend
   on pressure because of some combination of dual mode and/or
   plasticization effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The gas permeation properties from thick (bulk) films have long been
   used as a guide to the performance of asymmetric membranes with a very
   thin selective skin (similar to 100 nm). However, recent research has
   shown that thin films of glassy polymer with a similar thickness undergo
   more rapid physical aging than such thick films, leading to different
   permeation characteristics. Our prior work has dealt with pure gases,
   and most recently, pure CO2 has been used to explore the difference in
   plasticization behavior for thick and thin films. This paper is the
   first effort to look at mixed gases involving CO2 and how thin films
   differ from thick films. Thick and thin films made of Matrimid, an
   important polymide for commercial gas separation membranes, have been
   investigated by monitoring their gas permeability and selectivity
   simultaneously for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 gas mixtures. The effects of film
   thickness, aging time, pressure, gas pair and gas composition on mixed
   gas behavior have been discussed in detail. The pressure dependence of
   pure gas permeability has also been measured as a control. Matrimid
   films become more vulnerable to CO2 plasticization as the thickness is
   reduced to the range of thin selective skins of asymmetric membranes and
   with increasing aging time. Competitive sorption/permeation effects
   appear to be more pronounced and the combined effect of CO2
   plasticization and competitive sorption/permeation on thin Matrimid
   films seems to be more severe for CO2/CH4 feed mixtures than for CO2/N-2
   mixtures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   matrix. A strategy that overcomes many of these difficulties is
   described here with a view towards incorporating MWCNT with carbon black
   or silica for improved elastomer performance in such applications as
   tires. Key issues are control of the MWCNT surface functionality for
   proper individual tube dispersion, their aspect ratio for a balance of
   mechanical performance versus melt processability and an appropriate
   masterbatch concentration for ease of further formulation by rubber
   goods manufacturers. Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), commonly used as a
   tread stock for tires, is employed here as the matrix for creation of a
   masterbatch with oxidized MWCNT (12.3 -15 wt.\%). Masterbatch rheology
   is necessary to understand how to achieve good dispersion and
   conformation of the MWCNT in the final product. Rheological
   characterization of the masterbatch nanocomposites and their dilutions
   over shear rate ranges relevant for processing will be described.
   Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations have
   revealed that this process produces good dispersion of the MWCNT's in
   the SBR matrix. The distribution of diameters, contour lengths, and
   end-to-end distances of the MWCNT in these formulations has also been
   determined. Effective tube aspect ratios for the nanocomposites with
   various MWCNT loadings were estimated by analysis of the rheological
   data for uncured specimens and the dynamic mechanical properties of
   cured composites using the Guth-Gold-Smallwood theory. These materials
   do not show a high level of electrical conductivity as might be expected
   from a percolation concept, signifying excellent tube dispersion and
   formation of a bound rubber layer on the discrete MWCNT. (C) 2013

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Process hardware improvements have significantly increased the amount of
   information collected in industrial facilities, which allows the use of
   tools such as multivariable statistical analysis for process monitoring.
   Nevertheless, such statistical models tend to be static and extremely
   general when implemented in process facilities with several modes of
   operation, as is the case of carbon dioxide removal processes. This work
   demonstrates the use of multivariable statistical analysis for process
   transitions between different modes of operation. Continuous process
   analytics are used to define key variables, named ``state variables{''},
   to determine the current mode of operation. This work also makes use of
   parallel coordinates to illustrate the simultaneous visualization of
   several transition paths and statistical tests. Such tests apply
   confidence limits that are appropriate to the current mode of operation.
   This methodology is successfully tested in the CO2 capture plant at the
   University of Texas in Austin. The results show the effectiveness of
   using this type of application to detect abnormal operating conditions
   at different levels of operations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We describe a seeded hydrothermal process for the growth of unique
   double-sided brush-shaped (DSBS) TiO2 nanostructure assemblies
   consisting of highly ordered rutile nanowires vertically aligned around
   an annealed TiO2 nanoparticle layer. The annealed TiO2 nanoparticle
   layer seeds the nanowire growth and also supports the DSBS structure.
   The morphology of the DSBS TiO2 nanostructure depends on the
   hydrothermal reaction time. The diameter of the nanowires is about 6.6
   nm, and with increasing reaction time from 1 to 8 h the nanowire length
   increases from 0.6 to 6.2 mu m, whereas the thickness of the
   nanoparticle layer decreases from 4.3 to 2.8 mu m. These freestanding
   nanowire arrays provide large internal surface area, which is essential
   for minimizing carrier recombination in high performance photovoltaic
   devices. Furthermore, the nanowire architecture can help increase the
   rate of charge transport as compared to particulate films because of
   lower concentration of grain boundaries. The power conversion efficiency
   of backside (DSBS TiO2/FTO photoanode) illuminated dye-sensitized solar
   cells fabricated using the DSBS TiO2 nanostructure assembly is found to
   be depended on the nanowire length. A cell fabricated using 15.2 mu m
   thick nanostructures sensitized by N719 has a short-circuit current
   density of 12.18 mA cm(-2), 0.78 V open circuit potential, and a 0.59.
   filling factor, yielding a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.61\%

Abstract = {{In this study, we comprehensively evaluate chloride- and
   ionic-strength-mediated changes in the physical morphology, dissolution,
   and bacterial toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which are one of
   the most-used nanomaterials. The findings isolate the impact of ionic
   strength from that of chloride concentration. As ionic strength
   increases, AgNP aggregation likewise increases (such that the
   hydrodynamic radius {[}HR] increases), fractal dimension (D-f) strongly
   decreases (providing increased available surface relative to suspensions
   with higher D-f), and the release of Ag-(aq) increases. With increased
   Ag+ in solution, Escherichia coli demonstrates reduced tolerance to AgNP
   exposure (i.e., toxicity increases) under higher ionic strength
   conditions. As chloride concentration increases, aggregates are formed
   (HR increases) but are dominated by AgCl(s)0 bridging of AgNPs;
   relatedly, D-f increases. Furthermore, AgNP dissolution strongly
   increases under increased chloride conditions, but the dominant,
   theoretical, equilibrium aqueous silver species shift to negatively
   charged AgClx(x-1)- species, which appear to be less toxic to E. coli.
   Thus, E. coli demonstrates increased tolerance to AgNP exposure under
   higher chloride conditions (i.e., toxicity decreases). Expression
   measurements of katE, a gene involved in catalase production to
   alleviate oxidative stress, support oxidative stress in E. coli as a
   result of Ag+ exposure. Overall, our work indicates that the
   environmental impacts of AgNPs must be evaluated under relevant water
   chemistry conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Utilization of exogenous sugars found in lignocellulosic biomass
   hydrolysates, such as xylose, must be improved before yeast can serve as
   an efficient biofuel and biochemical production platform. In particular,
   the first step in this process, the molecular transport of xylose into
   the cell, can serve as a significant flux bottleneck and is highly
   inhibited by other sugars. Here we demonstrate that sugar transport
   preference and kinetics can be rewired through the programming of a
   sequence motif of the general form G-G/F-XXX-G found in the first
   transmembrane span. By evaluating 46 different heterologously expressed
   transporters, we find that this motif is conserved among functional
   transporters and highly enriched in transporters that confer growth on
   xylose. Through saturation mutagenesis and subsequent rational
   mutagenesis, four transporter mutants unable to confer growth on glucose
   but able to sustain growth on xylose were engineered. Specifically,
   Candida intermedia gxs1 Phe(38)Ile(39)Met(40), Scheffersomyces stipitis
   rgt2 Phe(38) and Met(40), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae hxt7
   Ile(39)Met(40)Met(340) all exhibit this phenotype. In these cases,
   primary hexose transporters were rewired into xylose transporters. These
   xylose transporters nevertheless remained inhibited by glucose.
   Furthermore, in the course of identifying this motif, novel wildtype
   transporters with superior monosaccharide growth profiles were
   discovered, namely S. stipitis RGT2 and Debaryomyces hansenii 2D01474.
   These findings build toward the engineering of efficient pentose
   utilization in yeast and provide a blueprint for reprogramming
   transporter properties.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel methodology for predicting human gait pattern
   kinematics based on a statistical and stochastic approach using a method
   called Gaussian process regression (GPR). We selected 14 body parameters
   that significantly affect the gait pattern and 14 joint motions that
   represent gait kinematics. The body parameter and gait kinematics data
   were recorded from 113 subjects by anthropometric measurements and a
   motion capture system. We generated a regression model with GPR for gait
   pattern prediction and built a stochastic function mapping from body
   parameters to gait kinematics based on the database and GPR, and
   validated the model with a cross validation method. The function can not
   only produce trajectories for the joint motions associated with gait
   kinematics, but can also estimate the associated uncertainties. Our
   approach results in a novel, low-cost and subject-specific method for
   predicting gait kinematics with only the subject's body parameters as
   the necessary input, and also enables a comprehensive understanding of
   the correlation and uncertainty between body parameters and gait
   kinematics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this paper was to investigate the impact of
   asphalt chemical composition on the microstructure and performance
   characteristics of asphalt binder. The methods implemented in this study
   include adsorption-desorption chromatography analysis and a range of
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) and chemical force microscopy techniques.
   It was revealed through the study that certain asphalt chemical
   parameters have a consistent and measureable effect on the asphalt
   microstructure that is observed with AFM. Particular microstructures
   that emerged via chemical doping were then discovered to have unique
   chemical polarity, which explicitly impact durability and performance of
   asphalt. In fact, a surprising correlation was found between the
   saturates chemical parameter and the effects of oxidative aging on
   asphalt behaviour. The findings from this research directly contribute
   to the improvement of modelling capability while also creating new
   prospects for enhancing the performance characteristics and durability
   of asphalt binder.}},

Abstract = {{Selective laser sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing technique
   able to rapidly create parts directly from a CAD model using a laser to
   selectively fuse successive layers of powder. However, defects can arise
   in SLS parts due to incomplete fusion of the powder layers or thermal
   stresses introduced by large temperature gradients during the part
   build. Accurate models of the SLS process are needed to ensure that high
   quality parts are produced and to allow new materials and designs to be
   used without requiring extensive experimentation. Most existing models
   of the SLS process are very narrowly focused, predicting the temperature
   history of a single powder layer after a single laser pass or examining
   the impact of a few processing parameters on the properties of the
   produced part. A model capable of predicting a complete temperature
   history during an entire part build does not yet exist. Therefore, a new
   thermal model able to simulate multiple powder layers is proposed.
   A transient, three-dimensional, finite volume model is developed and
   implemented in ANSYS Fluent. A domain of cells representing multiple
   layers of an SLS build is initialized, some with the properties of air
   and some with the properties of powder, depending on cell location. A
   Gaussian heat source representing the laser is applied to the top layer
   of powder cells. The center of the Gaussian is varied with time along an
   established path to simulate the motion of the laser along the powder
   bed. At all times the three-dimensional heat equation is solved to
   produce a temperature profile of the powder bed. When the laser
   completes a full scan of the powder layer, the air cells directly above
   the powder layer are re-initialized as powder cells and re-set to an
   initial temperature, representing the addition of a new powder layer.
   The process is repeated for each new layer. Temperature history results
   from the model are validated against experimental data available in the
   literature and good agreement is obtained. As the model accounts for
   multiple powder layers, it can be used to simulate an entire part build
   and predict the impact of any of the SLS processing parameters on part
   quality and thus enable better control and optimization of the SLS
   process.}},

Abstract = {{We have designed, implemented and deployed a Massive Open Online Class
   (MOOC) with a substantial lab component within the edX platform. If
   MOOCs are truly going to transform the education, then they must be able
   to deliver laboratory classes. This offering goes a long way in
   unraveling the perceived complexities in delivering a laboratory
   experience to tens of thousands of students from all around the globe.
   We believe the techniques developed in this class will significantly
   transform the MOOC environment. Effective education requires students to
   learn by doing. In the traditional academic setting this active learning
   is delivered in a lab format. A number of important factors have
   combined that allow a lab class like this to be taught at this time.
   First, we have significant support from industrial partners ARM Inc and
   Texas Instruments. Second, the massive growth of embedded
   microcontrollers has made the availability of lost-cost development
   platforms feasible. Third, we have assembled a team with the passion,
   patience, and experience of delivering quality lab experiences to large
   classes. Fourth, on-line tools now exist that allow students to interact
   and support each other. We used edX for the delivery of videos,
   interactive animations, text, and quizzes. We used Piazza for discussion
   boards and Zyante for a programming reference. We partnered with
   element-14, Digikey, and Mouser to make sure the lab kit is available
   and low-cost. In this paper we will present best practices, successes
   and limitations of teaching a substantial lab across the globe.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, the primary tools in alleviating the ``Memory Wall{''} have
   been large cache hierarchies and data prefetchers. Both approaches,
   become more challenging in modern, Chip-multiprocessor (CMP) design.
   Increasing the last-level cache (LLC) size yields diminishing returns in
   terms of performance per Watt; given VLSI power scaling trends, this
   approach becomes hard to justify. These trends also impact hardware
   budgets for prefetchers. Moreover, in the context of CMPs running
   multiple concurrent processes, prefetching accuracy is critical to
   prevent cache pollution effects. These concerns point to the need for a
   light-weight prefetcher with high accuracy. Existing data prefetchers
   may generally be classified as low-overhead and low accuracy (Next-n,
   Stride, etc.) or high-overhead and high accuracy (STeMS, ISB). We
   propose B-Fetch: a data prefetcher driven by branch prediction and
   effective address value speculation. B-Fetch leverages control flow
   prediction to generate an expected future path of the executing
   application. It then speculatively computes the effective address of the
   load instructions along that path based upon a history of past register
   transformations. Detailed simulation using a cycle accurate simulator
   shows a geometric mean speedup of 23.4\% for single-threaded workloads,
   improving to 28.6\% for multi-application workloads over a baseline
   system without prefetching. We find that B-Fetch outperforms an existing
   ``best-of-class{''} light-weight prefetcher under single-threaded and
   multiprogrammed workloads by 9\% on average, with 65\% less storage
   overhead.}},

   estimation methods specifically, the dynamic Origin-Destination (OD)
   demand estimation. This chapter investigates the feasibility of using
   VS-LBSN data to estimate dynamic Origin-Destination (OD) travel demand
   for general trips. A combined non-parametric cluster and regression
   model is used to establish the relationship between VS-LBSN data and the
   trip production and attraction. A modified gravity model-based trip
   distribution method with three friction function variations is proposed
   to estimate the 01) matrix. The proposed methods are calibrated and
   evaluated against the ground truth OD data from CMAP (Chicago

Abstract = {{Heart valves control the blood flow and play an extremely important role
   in the functioning of heart. Either due to congenital defects or due to
   the changes with remodeling, the leaflets functionality is altered
   sometimes resulting in less efficient heart output. Such problems are
   difficult to diagnose at an early stage and may lead to heart failure if
   left untreated. In this work, we present a method for determining the
   functional properties of heart valve leaflets from non-invasive imaging
   modules. As a first step, we use in-vitro experimental data from porcine
   bioprosthetic heart valve in a flow loop. We present the details of
   inverse model, its validation against experimental data and sensitivity
   to various input parameters and optimization constraints. In addition,
   we briefly touch upon other components of this in-vivo assessment tool
   -the average fiber architecture and the pre-strain in valve leaflets.
   This information when combined with the inverse model presented in this
   work will lead to an in-vivo assessment tool for heart valves and help
   diagnose problems in the mechanical functionality at an early stage.
   Additionally, this approach will have the potential to serve as a
   general-purpose in-vivo assessment tool for heart valves -for evaluating
   the performance of replaced prosthetic valves as well as monitoring the
   progression of valve diseases.}},

   potentially, to aortic valve (AV) dysfunction. While advances have been
   made toward the understanding of AVIC behavior ex-situ, the AVIC
   physical state in its native tissue microenvironment remains largely
   unknown. We hypothesize that deriving the biomechanical state of AVICs
   in-situ using an inverse modeling approach will reveal more accurate
   information regarding AVIC adaptations to various stimuli. Such an
   approach can reveal important changes resulting from pathological state
   and corresponding pharmaceutical interventions. To achieve this, a

Abstract = {{Over 11,000 people sustain spinal cord injury (SCI) each year in the
   United States {[}1]. Researchers have examined spinal progenitor cell
   implantation into the injury area to encourage axonal regeneration and
   found functional improvement with this treatment {[}2]. However,
   transplanted cell viability was low and there was no scaffold for axonal
   growth within the injured area. By providing a scaffold, cell viability
   should increase and axonal growth through the injury area should be
   supported. Further, the implanted spinal progenitor cells differentiated
   into astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocyte
   progenitors are promising in promoting functional recovery {[}3].
   Oligodendrocytes mature during neonatal development; therefore, cells
   are expected to respond favorably to mechanical properties similar to
   the neonatal environment. The mechanical and extracellular matrix
   properties of the scaffolds described here have been tuned to direct
   spinal progenitor cell differentiation toward oligodendrocytes.
   Thermally gelling systems were developed in 4 combinations: collagen
   alone, collagen and laminin, collagen and high molecular weight
   hyaluronic acid (hHA), and collagen, hHA, and laminin. All of these gel
   types have the same concentration of collagen (1.5 mg/mL), and
   compressive moduli below 2 kPa, which is within range of neural tissue
   (between 0.5-8 kPa) {[}4]. Multi-component hydrogels mimic mechanical
   properties of neonatal neural tissue most closely. After 5 days in
   culture, hydrogels provided an environment that allowed for spinal
   progenitor differentiation into astrocytes, neurons, and
   oligodendrocytes. Collagen-based hydrogels are viable thermally gelling
   systems to direct progenitor differentiation. These gels may promote
   regeneration after SCI in vivo by directing cell differentiation toward
   oligodendrocytes.}},

   levels of wind and wave loads. We assess the reliability of
   bottom-supported offshore wind turbines in ultimate limit states
   associated with the fore-aft tower bending moment at the mudline. We
   compare reliability index estimates for different characteristic load
   definitions and assumed coefficients of variation for wind and wave
   loads, as well as for various hydrodynamic to aerodynamic load
   influences. Effectively, such variations serve to describe different
   sites and turbine designs. Since large-diameter monopile support
   structures are dominated by inertia forces, while jacket or tripod
   support structures with smaller diameter members are dominated by drag
   forces, we extend an available combined wind-wave load effect model for
   offshore wind turbines, to include both drag and inertia forces. We show
   that reasonably uniform reliability levels may be achieved for various
   combinations of wind and wave loads. Results suggest that drag-dominated
   wave load cases result in smaller and less uniform reliability estimates
   than is the case for inertia-dominated wave load cases.}},

Abstract = {{By using a global simulation framework that employs a
   domain-decomposition strategy for computational efficiency, this study
   investigates the effects of fully nonlinear (FNL) waves on the fatigue
   loads exerted on the support structure (monopile) of a fixed-bottom
   offshore wind turbine. A comparison is made with more conventional
   linear wave hydrodynamics. The FNL numerical wave solver is invoked only
   on specific sub-domains where nonlinearities are detected; thus, only
   locally in space and time, a linear wave solution is replaced by the FNL
   results as input to the Morison equation used for the hydrodynamic
   loads. The accuracy and efficiency of this strategy allows long
   time-domain simulations where strongly nonlinear free-surface phenomena,
   like imminent breaking waves, are accounted for in the prediction of
   structural loads. The unsteady nonlinear free-surface problem governing
   the propagation of gravity waves is formulated using potential theory
   and a higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM) is used to discretize
   Laplace's equation. The FNL solver is employed and associated
   hydrodynamic loads are predicted in conjunction with aerodynamic loads
   on the rotor of a 5-MW wind turbine using the NREL open-source software,
   FAST. We assess fatigue loads by means of both time- and
   frequency-domain methods. This study shows that the use of linear
   theory-based hydrodynamics can lead to significant underestimation of
   fatigue loads and damage.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional non-reciprocal devices use ferromagnetic materials and an
   impressed external magnetic bias to break time-reversal symmetry. This
   solution typically leads to impractically large devices, losses and it
   is incompatible with integrated circuit technology. We discuss here a
   different approach to realize non-reciprocal microwave components and
   materials, based on biasing meta-molecules with the angular-momentum
   vector. We show that this solution can provide as large non-reciprocity
   and isolation as magnetically-biased ferrite components, but without
   their drawbacks. In particular, we present the design and realization of
   an integrated, magnetic-free, compact microwave circulator realized with
   conventional circuit components on a dielectric substrate, fully
   compatible with integrated circuit technology. By using appropriate
   spatiotemporal modulation of a magnetic-free distributed-element
   resonating ring, we report over 47 dB isolation and a deeply
   subwavelength size. We also envision the realization of non-reciprocal

   far predicted in one-dimensional (1D) structures, i.e., for planar slabs
   that are reflectionless when excited in one direction, while have strong
   reflections from the other direction. Here we generalize this concept to
   three-dimensional (3D) systems. Contrary to the 1D case, where only two
   directions are relevant, in the 3D case the full 4 pi solid angle needs
   to be considered, making this scenario much richer and with far more
   exciting possibilities. Interestingly enough, we prove that the
   unidirectional invisibility condition derived here for parity-time
   symmetric systems is also the optimal cloaking condition for incidence
   from a particular direction. Our analytical theory is developed for a
   sub-wavelength sphere uniformly surrounded by resonant plasmonic
   nanoparticles with gain and loss. A method for the realization of such
   nanoparticles using a core-shell geometry is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique for topology optimization of fluid
   channels using generative design methods. The proposed method uses the
   generative abilities of graph grammars with simulation and analysis
   power of conventional CFD methods. The graph grammar interpreter
   GraphSynth is used to carry out graph transformations, which define
   different topologies for a given multi-inlet multi-outlet problem. The
   generated graphs are first transformed into meaningful 3D shapes. These
   solutions are then analyzed by a CFD solver to find the optimum. The
   effectiveness of the proposed method is checked by solving a variety of
   available test problems and comparing them with those found in the
   literature. Furthermore by solving complex problems the robustness and
   effectiveness of the method is tested.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research in the field of composite materials has shown that it is
   theoretically possible to produce composite materials with macroscopic
   mechanical stiffness and loss properties that surpass those of
   conventional composites. This research explores the possibility of
   designing and fabricating these composite materials by embedding small
   volume fractions of negative stiffness inclusions in a continuous host
   material. Achieving high stiffness and loss from these materials by
   design, however, is a nontrivial task. This paper presents a
   hierarchical multiscale material model for these materials, coupled with
   a set-based, multilevel design approach based on Bayesian network
   classifiers. Bayesian network classifiers are used to map promising
   regions of the design space at each hierarchical modeling level, and
   then the maps are intersected to identify sets of multilevel or
   multiscale solutions that are likely to provide desirable system
   performance. Length scales range from the behavior of the structured
   microscale negative stiffness inclusions to the effective properties of
   mesoscale composite materials to the performance of an illustrative
   macroscale component--a vibrating beam coated with the high stiffness,
   high loss composite material.}},

Abstract = {{With the increase in computer-controlled hybrid machining (e.g.
   mill-turn machines), one needs to discern what features of a part are
   created during turning (i.e. with a lathe cutter) versus those created
   by milling. Given a generic part shape, it is desirable to extract the
   turnable and non-turnable features in order to obtain feasible machining
   plans. A novel approach for automating this division and for defining
   the resulting turning operations in a hybrid process is proposed in this
   paper. The algorithm is based on identifying the dominant
   rotational-axis and performing several non-uniform lateral
   cross-sections to quickly generate the ``as lathed{''} model. The part
   is then subtracted from the original model to isolate the non-turnable
   features. Next, resulting model and features are translated to a label
   rich graph and fed into a grammar reasoning tool to produce feasible
   manufacturing plans. The setup design is also studied against the
   tolerances specified by the designer. Performance of the algorithm has
   been tested on several examples ranging from simple to complex parts.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of density algorithms (EDAs) have been developed for
   optimization of discrete, continuous, or mixed discrete and continuous
   simulation-based design problems. EDAs construct a probability
   distribution on the set of highest performing designs and sample the
   distribution for the next generation of solutions. In previous work, the
   authors have demonstrated how classifier-guided sampling can also be
   used for discrete variable, discontinuous design space exploration. In
   this paper we develop the rationale for using classifier-guided sampling
   as a simple step beyond EDAs that not only improves the characterization
   of the highest performing designs but also identifies the poorly
   performing designs and exploits that information for faster convergence
   to optimal solutions. The resulting method is novel in its use of
   Bayesian priors to model the inherent uncertainty in a probability
   distribution that is based on a limited number of samples from the
   design space. The new classifier-guided method is applied to several
   example problems and convergence rates are presented that compare
   favorably to random search and a basic EDA implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Early manufacturability feedback is critical for reducing product cost
   and lead-time. This paper describes a new architecture and platform for
   authoring and applying manufacturability rules for design. The key step
   is to define a domain-specific ontology by creating a higher-level
   semantic language that describes design and manufacturing concepts
   relevant to specific manufacturing processes. This language has two
   primary uses; express design in the context of manufacturing and relate
   manufacturing constraints on design as declarative rules. OWL and Jena
   (a reasoning engine) are used in the background to reason about specific
   designs and provide manufacturability feedback in a client-server model.
   The use of Semantic Web technology makes it easier to augment
   manufacturability feedback with a query system for the designer that
   utilizes the same rule knowledge base to answer what-if scenarios. This
   is implemented using SPARQL and using the CAD design context and so
   enhances the user experience. This novel approach makes it easier for
   the domain experts to write or verify rules and the designers to
   validate concepts before changing the CAD model. This helps in
   maintaining the independence between the CAD platform and core
   enterprise knowledge. A pilot study in the sheet metal domain is
   implemented to demonstrate the steps necessary for complete early
   manufacturability analysis software and highlights the benefits of this
   approach.}},

   interesting example of a tunneling phenomenon induced by PT symmetry.
   Overall, the combination of the ENZ and PT -symmetry concepts may

   consider the joint optimization of network resource allocation and video
   quality adaptation. Our objective is to fairly maximize video clients'
   Quality of Experience (QoE) realizing tradeoffs among the mean quality,
   temporal variability in quality, and fairness, incorporating user
   preferences on rebuffering and cost of video delivery. We present a
   simple asymptotically optimal online algorithm, NOVA, to solve the
   problem. NOVA is asynchronous, and using minimal communication,
   distributes the tasks of resource allocation to network controller, and
   quality adaptation to respective video clients. Video quality adaptation
   in NOVA is also optimal for standalone video clients, and is well suited
   for use in the DASH framework. Further, NOVA can be extended for use
   with more general QoE models, networks shared with other traffic loads
   and networks using fixed/legacy resource allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular systems using Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmissions
   leveraging clusters of spatially distributed radio antennas as Virtual
   Base Stations (VBSs) have the potential to realize overall throughput
   gains and, perhaps more importantly, can deliver substantial enhancement
   to poor performing ``edge{''} users. In this paper we propose a novel
   framework aimed at fully exploiting the potential of such systems
   through dynamic radio resource clustering and user scheduling which
   maximize system utility. The dynamic clustering problem is modeled as a
   maximum weight clustering problem which is NP-hard, however, we show
   that by structuring the set of possible VBSs to be ``2-decomposable{''}
   it can be efficiently computed. We also propose to optimize over a class
   of power allocation policies to radio resources, and thus VBSs, which
   allow dynamic user scheduling and flexible power allocations depending
   on instantaneous channel realizations. We use simulation to compare our
   approach with a state-of-the-art baseline which exploits dynamic
   frequency reuse and opportunistic user scheduling, but no clustering,
   and show edge users' throughput gains are as high as 80\% without
   degrading the performance of others.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of external infection sources on phase transitions
   in epidemic processes. In particular, we consider an epidemic spreading
   on a network via the SIS/SIR dynamics, which in addition is aided by
   external agents - sources unconstrained by the graph, but possessing a
   limited infection rate or virulence. Such a model captures many existing
   models of externally aided epidemics, and finds use in many settings -
   epidemiology, marketing and advertising, network robustness, etc. We
   provide a detailed characterization of the impact of external agents on
   epidemic thresholds. In particular, for the SIS model, we show that any
   external infection strategy with constant virulence either fails to
   significantly affect the lifetime of an epidemic, or at best, sustains
   the epidemic for a lifetime which is polynomial in the number of nodes.
   On the other hand, a random external-infection strategy, with rate
   increasing linearly in the number of infected nodes, succeeds under some
   conditions to sustain an exponential epidemic lifetime. We obtain
   similar sharp thresholds for the SIR model, and discuss the relevance of
   our results in a variety of settings.}},

Abstract = {{Assembly planning is an important task for manufacturing industrial
   products. The ability to automate and optimize the process is crucial as
   it can improve the production time, cost and efficiency. In general, the
   planning procedure involves two main reasoning stages, one is based on
   geometric reasoning and the other is based on Al tree-search. In this
   article, a novel approach to automate the geometric reasoning stage for
   large assembly systems is proposed. This technique provides a fast and
   accurate measure of capturing feasible spatial interactions and
   relationships between elements of a CAD assembly with no manual
   interventions. These results are then used by a suite of Al planning
   tools to generate optimal assembly sequences. The algorithm has been
   tested on a variety of examples resembling real products and results
   show the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This research evaluates the feasibility of assisting orthodontists to
   treat irregularities in teeth by computing the geometric transformations
   to move each tooth to its ideal position. The intent is to help
   orthodontists craft a precise and specific treatment plan for each
   patient. The inputs for finding the transformations are the patient's
   teeth mold and dental arch templates. A 3D laser scanner is used to
   generate a point cloud data representation of the patient's teeth mold.
   A commercial solid modeler is used to construct a non-uniform rational
   B-spline surface from this point cloud. Transformations are then
   computed by establishing a multiple scan registration, matching the axis
   of the patient's teeth model and dental arch templates, and computation
   of initial and final positions of the teeth. The steps in the process
   and the algorithms developed were implemented in the scripting language
   of the solid modeler. Details of the algorithms are provided, and a case
   study is presented to demonstrate the process.}},

Abstract = {{Crosslinkable segmented random copolymers are made by synthesizing a
   polyimide in the presence of bisaminopropyl dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   oligomers. The polyimide segments of these materials are composed of two
   different dianhydrides, 2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane
   dianhydride (6FDA), and 3,3', 4,4'-benzophenone tetracarboxylic
   dianhydride (BTDA) with the base diamine,
   2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3-phenylenediamine (DAM). Upon irradiation with UV
   light, the ketone group in BTDA can form radicals that crosslink with
   adjacent benzylic methyl groups on DAM. Thermal analysis reveals that
   siloxane-containing polyimide copolymer films are phase segregated,
   composed of a polyimide-rich continuous phase and dispersed PDMS phase.
   CO2 and N-2 gas permeabilities of uncrosslinked and crosslinked samples
   were measured to investigate the effect of UV crosslinking on
   permeability and permselectivity. Incorporation of PDMS did not
   significantly change the transport properties of the membranes.
   Densification occurred as a result of UV crosslinking, which enhanced
   the size-sieving capability of the poly(imide-siloxane) segmented
   copolymer membrane. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The development of CO2 capture systems has largely focused on single
   separation technologies (absorption, adsorption, membranes, cryogenics,
   etc.). Few studies have examined the merits of combining multiple
   separation technologies into a hybrid capture system. Membrane
   Technology \& Research, Inc. (MTR) and the University of Texas at Austin
   (UT Austin) are collaborating to investigate two variations of a hybrid
   membrane-absorption capture system which combine MTR's air-swept Polaris
   (TM) membrane contactor with UT Austin's 5 m piperazine advanced flash
   stripper (AFS; 5 m PZ-AFS) capture technology with cold and warm-rich
   bypass. In one embodiment, the systems are arranged in series and in
   another, in parallel.
   In the series configuration, the absorber removes approximately half of
   the CO2 in the flue gas, followed by additional separation by the
   membrane contactor to achieve 90\% total removal of CO2 by the hybrid
   capture system. In this arrangement, the absorber operates at a higher
   lean-loading state and also benefits from the ability of the downstream
   membrane to mitigate fugitive amine emissions. In the parallel
   configuration, the flue gas leaving the power plant is split and treated
   by each system in a parallel arrangement. The principal advantage is
   that the absorber can be roughly half the size it would normally be. In
   both configurations, the 5 m PZ-AFS system will treat a more
   concentrated CO2 stream which is a preferred condition. The project team
   found that the minimum O-2 content in the combustion air stream (18\%
   for retrofit, 17\% for Greenfield) acted to limit the potential of the
   hybrid-series configuration. In the best case design of the
   hybrid-parallel arrangement, the 5 m PZ-AFS system treats 53\% of the
   total flue gas volume with a CO2 concentration in the flue gas greater
   than 23\%. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were absorbed into aqueous
   amine to determine the absorbing species, the absorption kinetics, and
   the aqueous products at the ppm-level NOx concentrations typical of flue
   gas from fossil fuel power plants. At flue gas conditions of 0.5-5 ppm
   of NO2, absorption is dominated by free radical absorption of NO2 as
   nitrite. NO2 absorption kinetics are first order in NO2 partial
   pressure, half order in free amine concentration, and fastest in
   methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). The reaction-enhanced liquid mass transfer
   coefficient for NO2 absorption in 8 m piperazine (PZ) at absorber
   conditions is 9.7{*}10(-7) mol/s.m(2).Pa, yielding 92\% NO2 absorption
   at a typical A/G of 3.3{*}10(6) s.Pa.m(2)/mol. Similarly, a 9 m
   monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent will absorb roughly 70\% of the inlet NO2
   while a 7 m MDEA/2 m PZ solvent will absorb over 99\% of the NO2.
   Nitrite and nitrate are the main NOx absorption products in MDEA with
   nitrite dominating at low NO2 partial pressures. In PZ, the amine free
   radical formed during NO2 absorption will react with NO to directly form
   n-nitrosopiperazine (MNPZ) or react with itself to form 2-piperazinol
   (2-PZOH). Typical nitrosamine yields in 5 m PZ are around 15\% of total
   absorbed NOx and can be halved with the addition of 200 mM Inhibitor A,
   a free radical scavenger. Nitrate and nitramine are minor products of
   NOx absorption, accounting for less than 5\% of total absorbed NOx. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent pilot-scale CO2 capture plants have found that amine condensation
   onto seed nuclei results in very high amine emissions which are very
   difficult to characterize and control using traditional aerosol removal
   techniques. Modeling and experiments have shown significant potential to
   efficiently capture high density, submicron particles in packed columns
   by adjusting contactor operating conditions. This study presents the
   influence of operating conditions on total (gas and aerosol) emissions
   of piperazine (PZ) measured by hot-gas Fourier Transform Infrared
   Spectroscopy (FTIR) from a bench-scale CO2 absorber with RSR-0.3 random
   packing using 0.9 m PZ. Aerosols were created by vaporizing and quickly
   condensing 0.5 m PZ and 0.05 vol \% sulfuric acid (H2SO4). PZ was
   inversely proportional to solvent temperature and flowrate, but
   increased independent of the inlet CO2 with PZ/H2O seed nuclei. PZ
   emissions were proportional to flowrate and inversely related to inlet
   CO2 concentration for H2SO4/H2O condensation nuclei. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{An important environmental issue for amine-based post-combustion CO2
   capture is the generation of reclaimer sludge containing degradation
   products and impurities that must be disposed. This paper evaluated the
   environmental fate of reclaimer wastes generated from three amine-based
   solvents (monoethanolamine, piperazine, and a
   methyldiethanolamine/piperazine blend) used for CO2 capture at a
   pulverized coal and a natural-gas combined cycle power plant (900 and
   810 MWe, respectively) with typical flue gas compositions. The solvent
   loss and impurities and degradation accumulation in the CO2 capture
   units were modeled. A techno-economic analysis of different reclaiming
   technologies was conducted. The reclaimer sludge was classified based on
   US and EU regulations for hazardous waste, and alternative options for
   reclaimer sludge disposal were evaluated. (C) 2014 The Authors.

   is an attractive solvent for CO2 capture from coal-fired power plants. A
   rigorous thermodynamic model was developed in Aspen Plus (R) to predict
   properties of PZ/AEP/H2O/CO2, using the electrolyte-Nonrandom Two-Liquid
   (eNRTL) activity coefficient model. A sequential regression was
   performed to represent CO2 solubility, speciation, and amine volatility

   model predicts a CO2 cyclic capacity of 0.86 mol/kg (PZ + AEP + water)
   for 5 m PZ/2 m AEP, compared to 0.50 mol/kg for 7 m MEA and 0.86 mol/kg
   for 8 m PZ. The predicted heat of absorption is 75 to 85 kJ/mol CO2 in
   the operating loading range (0.288-0.380 mol CO2/mol alkalinity).
   Speciation for PZ/AEP/H2O at various CO2 loading and temperature was
   also predicted, from which behavior of CO2 in the amine system was

Abstract = {{The equimolal CO2 solvent, 4 m 2-methylpiperazine (2MPZ)/4 m piperazine
   (PZ), was modeled in Aspen Plus (R) using the eNRTL thermodynamic
   framework. Data were regressed using binary interaction parameters. The
   sequential regression method was used starting from prior PZ and 2MPZ
   models. The model correctly predicts the CO2 equilibrium partial
   pressure from 40-160 degrees C. The average differential heat of
   absorption is close to the expected value of 70 kJ/mol CO2. Newly
   reported data show that previous data overpredicted viscosity.
   Activity-based kinetics were used with pairs of power-law reactions
   representing the forward and reverse reactions. Fluxes measured in a WWC
   for lean to rich loading and for 40 - 5 100 degrees C were matched,
   yielding a SSE of 2.39. The kinetic model used ten different reactions
   along with the diffusivity of amine-products to capture the rate
   behavior. This model can be used for techno-economic assessments, pilot

Abstract = {{There are many correlations of liquid phase mass transfer coefficient
   (kL) for packings in the literature; most were developed without data
   that vary liquid viscosity (pc) significantly (< 5 cP). In CO2 capture
   by amine scrubbing, pc, of aqueous amine may be significantly greater
   than water, which makes it important to know how mass transfer is
   affected by pc. A research plan is proposed to measure the effective
   mass transfer area (as) and kL in a pilot-scale packed column with fic
   from 1 to 100 cP. Glycerol was chosen as the viscosity enhancer for its
   complete solubility in water and the Newtonian behavior of its aqueous
   solution. Models were built to estimate the physical properties (mu(L),
   rho, D-CO2, H-CO2, gamma) of CO2/NaOH/H2O/glycerol based on literature
   data. Kinetic data (kg) for the system were obtained with a wetted wall
   column (WWC). The kinetic data, kg', was found to initially increase
   with glycerol concentration because of the catalytic effect of glycerol,
   then decrease rapidly because of the increase in pc. The overall
   reaction rate constant (kAlk) was determined from kg' data, and was
   found to increase with glycerol concentration until it becomes
   asymptotic. This model for kg' will be used for future measurement of ae

Abstract = {{Post-combustion amine scrubbing is a highly integrated process that uses
   extensive material and energy recycling to reduce costs and increase
   efficiency. As a result, the process variables exhibit a fast time scale
   at the unit level associated with the large recycle flows and a slow
   time scale at the plant level associated with the small feed and product
   flows. A reduced order model was developed for the system, and the
   material balances were demonstrated to be in nonstandard singularly
   perturbed form. Only the stripper vapor mole fractions evolve
   exclusively on the slow time scale in this model form; all other model
   states have both slow and fast components. By applying a variable
   transformation, the model is arranged into standard singularly perturbed
   form. The slow states in this form are the overall process material
   hold-ups as well as the stripper vapor mole fractions. An effective
   control strategy for the process should control the CO2 removal rate and
   overall system inventory on the slow time scale using the small stripper
   overhead flowrate and a cascaded level setpoint controller,
   respectively. We show that attempting to control CO2 removal rate with
   the large solvent recycle rate will likely lead to an ill-conditioned
   controller. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   with membrane technology, the CO2 concentration in the flue gas may be

   CO2 with the Independence model for piperazine (PZ) in Aspen Plus (R). 5
   molal (m) PZ was chosen as the solvent with a solvent rate of 1.1{*}
   L-min. To estimate the absorber performance in this range, a factorial
   design has been used to define the model inputs. Both in-and-out
   intercooling and pump-around intercooling have been simulated for the
   absorber. The model calculates the solvent rate, packing height, rich
   loading, and optimized position of intercooling for each case. Empirical
   correlations for rich loading and a semi-empirical correlation for
   normalized packing have been derived. When estimating real absorber
   performance, K-G equals k(g)(') measured in wetted wall column times a

Abstract = {{Three amines were tested as solvents for CO2 capture:
   monoisopropanolamine (MIPA) and 3 amino 1 propanol (MPA), which are
   primary amines, and diethanolamine (DEA), which is a secondary amine.
   The three amines were tested at 7 molal in water, which corresponds to
   30 wt \% monoethanolamine (MEA). The CO2 absorption rate and solubility
   in the solvents was measured using a bench scale wetted wall column
   (WWC) at 20-100 degrees C and over the range of CO2 loading expected for
   coal flue gas. The experimental data are analyzed to suggest performance
   in a real process. The performance of the three new amines are compared
   against literature results for 7 m MEA and other solvents with amines of
   related structures, such as 10 m Diglycolamine (DGA)(R) and 4.8 m
   2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). The mass transfer performance and the
   CO2 carrying ability of the amine are related to the structural
   hindrance and the pKa. The CO2 absorption rate of 7 m MIPA and 7 m DEA
   are competitive with 7 m MEA. For 7 m MPA, the measured liquid film mass
   transfer coefficient is about 20\% lower than 7 m MEA. The CO2
   solubility data are used to generate a semi-empirical model for each of
   the new solvents. The results for CO2 solubility at 40 degrees C suggest
   that MIPA and MPA have similar CO2 capacity to MEA, whereas DEA has
   double the CO2 capacity of the three primary amines. Based on the
   comparison of data collected in this work and literature results, it is
   generalized for unhindered amines that the overall CO2 mass transfer
   performance of the solvent is inversely related to the pKa of the amine.
   Also, the CO2 capacity of the amine increases with the relative
   hindrance of the nitrogen group in the amine molecule. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{CO2 capture from coal-fired power plants using amine scrubbing typically
   incurs a 20-30\% energy penalty. The major energy requirements are the
   reboiler duty for solvent regeneration and the compression work for CO2
   sequestration. The advanced flash stripper using 8 m PZ was proposed,
   which recovers the stripping steam heat by employing cold and warm rich
   bypasses. The objective of this work is to quantify the benefits of the
   advanced regeneration system as energy and capital cost. The advanced
   flash stripper saves 10\% total equivalent work that includes heat duty
   work, compression work, and pumping work compared to the simple
   stripper. From the economic analysis, it was found that the compressor
   and the cross exchangers are the two major capital costs of the
   regeneration system. By considering the cost of the main heat
   exchangers, the temperature approaches and pressure drops of the cross
   exchanger and the steam heater were optimized. The optimum LMTD of the
   cross exchanger is around 10 K, which saves 8\% regeneration cost
   compared to the base case with 5 K. The annualized regeneration cost of
   the advanced flash stripper is \$ 31/tonne CO2 at the optimum lean
   loading 0.20, providing 15\% cost savings compared to the base case
   simple stripper (5 K cross exchanger LMTD). (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The oxidative degradation of diamines was measured in a stirred reactor
   at 70 degrees C, 98kPa O-2, and 2kPa CO2. Amines studied include
   ethylenediamine (EDA), propylenediamine (PDA), 1,4-diaminobutane
   (putrescine), hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), propanolamine (MPA),
   Diglycolamine (R)(DGA (R)), and bisaminoethyl ether (Jeffamine EDR-104
   (R)). Amine solutions with an initial concentration of 10 m alkalinity,
   an initial loading of 0.4 mol CO2/mol alkalinity, and an initial metals
   concentration of 0.4 mM Fe, 0.2 mM Mn, 0.1 mM Ni, and 0.05 mM Cr were
   oxidatively degraded. The purpose of these experiments was to study the
   structural effect of diamines on their degradation rates.
   At high metals concentration of 4 mM Fe, 2 mM Mn, 1 mM Ni, and 0.5 mM
   Cr, PDA does not show signs of significant degradation. This is also
   true for PDA at the normal metal concentration of 0.4 mM Fe, 0.2 mM Mn,
   0.1 mM Ni, and 0.05 mM Cr. PDA was tested with antifoam and it did not
   show measurable degradation. EDA degradation follows zeroth order
   kinetics with a rate constant of 9.79 mmol/kg-hr and is likely mass
   transfer controlled. Putrescine degradation follows first order kinetics
   with a rate constant of 0.00104 1/hr and is likely kinetically
   controlled at experimental conditions. The degradation of HMDA follows
   first order kinetics with rate constant k = 0.01/hr. The degradation of
   bisaminoethyl ether follows first order kinetics with rate constant k =
   0.023/hr. DGA (R) degradation also follows first order kinetics with
   rate constant k = 0.008/hr. HMDA, Jeffamine EDR-104 (R), and DGA (R)
   degradation are all kinetically controlled. MPA showed negligible
   degradation after 260 hours of run time. There was no significant
   degradation observed for PDA with normal and high metals concentration
   in previous experiments. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A systematic evaluation of the solvent capacity and mass transfer
   benefits of absorber intercooling was conducted for CO2 capture with 8 m
   piperazine (PZ) for three different flue gas sources: NGCC (4.1\% CO2),
   coal-fired boiler (14.7\% CO2), and steel blast furnace (27.4\% CO2).
   The study identified the best intercooling strategy as a function of
   operating conditions (lean loading, liquid to gas ratio (L/G)). For all
   applications, operation at low lean loadings did not require
   intercooling to avoid temperature-related capacity or mass transfer
   penalties. In a broad intermediate loading range, simple in-and-out
   intercooling provided large solvent capacity benefits (measured as
   minimum solvent rate, LMIN) compared to a column without intercooling.
   LMIN was reduced by 71\%, 53\%, and 42\% for NGCC, coal, and steel,
   respectively. Finally, the coal and steel applications had a large L/G
   range at higher loadings where intercooling was once again unnecessary.
   An enhanced intercooling design for NGCC could yield up to 62\%
   reduction in packing and 46\% reduction in solvent capacity at specific
   conditions (benefits for coal and steel were much lower). A recycle
   intercooling design for NGCC was introduced to reduce overall column
   temperatures and enhance mass transfer. For the case evaluated with
   recycle intercooling, the new design achieved significant packing
   reductions (> 50\%) compared to a simple intercooling design and
   approximated the performance of an isothermal column. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. has proposed a hybrid system
   combining amine scrubbing with membrane technology to reduce energy
   cost. Previous studies of CO2 absorption mainly focused on coal-fired
   flue gas with 12\% CO2. However, in the hybrid process, the CO2 in the
   flue gas can be enriched to 20\%. Natural gas turbines will have flue
   gas with as little as 3\% CO2 Based on the arrangement, the hybrid
   amine/membrane system provides a gas to the system that has double the
   CO2 concentration of normal flue gas, reduces the volume of gas sent to
   the capture unit, or reduces the removal requirements for the capture
   unit.
   The objective of this work is to minimize the total energy use of
   stripping concentrated piperazine (PZ) at rich loading when treating
   flue gas from 3 to 20\% inlet CO2. The base-case stripping configuration
   is the advanced flash stripper with warm rich bypass and cold rich
   exchanger bypass.. This configuration includes two split
   cross-exchangers in series, a convective steam heater, a smaller
   stripper column, a low residence time flash tank, and stripping at high
   temperature to produce CO2 at 5 to 17 bar. Rich loading in 5 and 8 m PZ
   was varied from 0.37 to 0.43 mol CO2/mol N. For each rich loading, lean
   loading was optimized to minimize the total equivalent work. The
   ``Independence{''} model for PZ in Aspen Plus (R) was used to simulate
   the stripping performance.
   Because 5 m PZ has a lower viscosity than 8 m PZ, it can achieve a
   reduced approach temperature in the cross exchanger. The total energy
   performance for 5 m PZ is practically the same as 8 m PZ, even though
   the capacity of 5 m PZ is lower. Significantly more energy is required
   to regenerate solvents with lower rich loading. As CO2 rich loading
   increases, the equivalent work requirement decreases for the same
   loading difference between rich and lean. Stripping data for 24 cases,
   including heat duty, equivalent work, CO2 output pressure, and optimal
   cold and warm rich bypass were used to build a correlation with CO2 rich
   and lean loading. The Second Law efficiency based on the ratio of
   stripping minimum work and total ideal work was introduced to make the
   most of stripping work. The Second Law efficiency has a maximum value at
   a specific CO2 loading. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Geologic CO2 storage (GCS) can provide meaningful reduction of CO2
   emissions if implemented with large injection rates. The traditional
   paradigm for GCS entails injection of supercritical CO2 into a
   brine-filled formation with an implicit assumption that resident brine
   can be displaced through boundaries of the formation without adverse
   effects. In this paradigm, kh, the product of permeability and formation
   thickness, is the first order control on achievable injection rates, and
   the gradual buildup of pressure in the formation during the storage
   operation will reduce those rates. These two factors impose serious
   constraints on the overall storage rate. In contrast, examination of
   field-aggregated injection and production volumes during waterflooding
   operations in oil reservoirs reveals a notable lack of correlation
   between kh and achieved injection rates. This suggests that if CO2
   storage projects are operated in the same manner as waterflooded oil
   reservoirs, i.e. with both injection and extraction wells, located and
   operated to maximize rates, then material rates of storage can be
   achieved regardless of reservoir kh. When applied to a large set of
   storage formations, this mode of operation provides an otherwise
   unattainable overall rate of storage while greatly reducing risks
   associated with elevated pressure in storage regions. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The leakage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from deep geological storage into
   shallow aquifers has the potential to reduce the pH of the groundwater,
   which can facilitate dissolution and/or desorption of major cations and
   naturally occurring hazardous trace elements. Earlier studies show that
   desorption is the controlling mechanism for long term mobilization of
   solutes. In this paper, we study the mechanism of pH-dependent
   desorption of a cation (barium, Ba2+) and its transport behavior through
   a porous medium with a reactive surface dominated by iron oxide. We
   performed column flood experiments and numerical simulations applying
   conditions that resemble CO2-acidified brine leaking in a carbonate free
   potable shallow aquifer. The results show the formation of a retarded
   concentration front of desorbing Ba2+, with peak having a maximum
   concentration much larger than the initial value. The amplitude of the
   peak is sensitive to the pH of the acidified brine and the overall
   desorbed Ba2+ is controlled by the initial aquifer pH. This peak can
   locally exceed the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) regulated by the U.S.
   EPA presenting a health hazard. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The desired lifetime for CO2 injection for sequestration is several
   decades at a high injection rate ( up to 10 bbl/min or 2,400 tons/day
   per injector). Government regulations and geomechanical design
   constraints may impose a limit on the injection rate such that, for
   example, the bottomhole pressure remains less than 90\% of the hydraulic
   fracture pressure. Despite injecting below the critical fracture
   pressure, fractures can nevertheless initiate and propagate due to a
   thermoelastic stress reduction caused by cool CO2 encountering hot
   reservoir rock.
   Here we develop a numerical model to calculate whether mechanical and
   thermal equilibrium between the injected CO2 and the reservoir evolves,
   such that fracture growth ceases. When such a condition exists, the
   model predicts the corresponding fracture geometry and time to reach
   that state.
   The critical pressure for fracture propagation depends on the
   thermoelastic stress, a function of rock properties and the temperature
   difference between the injected fluid and the reservoir (Delta T).
   Fractures will propagate as long as the thermoelastic stress and the
   fluid pressure at the fracture tip exceed a threshold; we calculate the
   extent of a fracture such that the tip pressure falls below the
   thermoelastically modified fracture propagation pressure. Fracture
   growth is strongly dependent upon the formation permeability, the level
   of injection pressure above fracture propagation pressure, and Delta T.

   secure beneath the local capillary barriers, as long as the effective
   capillary pressure exerted by the trapped phase is smaller than the

Abstract = {{In large-scale CO2 sequestration project the formation temperature
   decreases as huge amounts of relatively cool CO2 are injected. Injection
   induced fractures from injectors are facilitated as the critical
   pressure in the formation for fracturing is reduced by considerable
   thermo-elastic stress, which is proportional to the temperature
   difference between CO2 and reservoir. In this study, we analyze
   injection induced fracture growth and its impact on CO2 plume migration
   by a semi-analytical quasi-steady state model in the case that injection
   induced fractures are permitted by regulators. By parametric analysis
   with the model, geological properties and operating conditions are
   investigated to show their sensitivity on fracture growth and CO2
   migration. This work provides analytical tools, which enable fast and
   simple screening of appropriate storage sites and of injection strategy,
   to predict fracturing and CO2 migration to avoid potential risks. (C)

Abstract = {{Local capillary trapping (LCT) occurs during buoyancy-driven migration
   of bulk phase CO2 within a saline aquifer exhibiting spatially varying
   properties (permeability and capillary entry pressure). When the rising
   CO2 plume encounters a region where capillary entry pressure is locally
   larger than average, CO2 accumulates beneath the region. The benefit of
   LCT, applied specially to CO2 sequestration, is that saturation of
   stored CO2 is larger than the saturation predicted for other trapping
   mechanisms, yet the CO2 is not susceptible to leakage through failed
   seals.
   In this paper, the effects of the injection rate, anisotropy, formation
   dip, aquifer types and residual gas saturation on the LCT
   saturation/mass were systematically investigated including the injection
   period. The domain with heterogeneous capillary pressure was generated
   by using geostatistical permeability realization and Leverett-J function
   to assign an individual drainage curve to each grid block. After
   injection, leakage was simulated that represents localized caprock
   breach induced by geochemical process or by stress/strain variation
   within the reservoir/caprock. The trend of the fraction of CO2 above
   residual that remains trapped after seal rupture was evaluated. Residual
   and dissolution trapping were assessed and compared to LCT over time
   during and after injection.
   Results indicate that local capillary traps in the near-well region can
   be fully filled during injection in the domain. Moreover, they remain
   filled after post-injection buoyancy-driven flow ends. The flow regimes
   are dependent on the injection rate, but LCT mass fraction is almost
   insensitive to the CO2 injection rate (gravity number). This implies
   that local capillary trapping is primarily determined by the geological
   model. Anisotropy does not change the LCT structures although it has
   some impact on the LCT CO2 saturation and plume dynamics. Formation dip
   angle is demonstrated to be the most influential parameters on the
   structures and mass fraction of injected CO2 held in LCT, as it changes
   the effective horizontal permeability correlation length. The key
   finding from this research is that LCT could be as significant as
   residual trapping in immobilizing CO2 during the intermediate period in
   the open aquifer. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Abstract = {{Simulations of buoyancy-driven CO2 migration indicate that as the degree
   of heterogeneity in CO2 storage domain increased, CO2 migration patterns
   evolved from `dispersed' capillary channels with minimal rock contact to
   back-filled `compact' distributions of saturation with much larger
   storage efficiency. Experiments with analog fluids and porous media made
   of varying degree of heterogeneity were conducted to test these
   predictions. It is found that the total storage capacity by local
   capillary trapping in such heterogeneous environment is mostly
   determined by the volume percentage of the beads of varying sizes.
   Smallest beads with maximum entry pressure contribute most to the
   integrity of the seal. A back-filled pattern of nonwetting phase, which
   corresponds to larger storage capacity, is formed in relatively
   heterogeneous media whose bead size difference between store and seal is
   large. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open

Abstract = {{A model for the time-dependent flow of CO2-saturated fluid through a
   leaky well is presented. This simple model accounts for laboratory
   observations of fracture sealing by secondary precipitation due to
   complex reactive transport coupling. The model uses the principle of
   flow in series and a logistic function to describe the evolution of the
   precipitation zone's effective permeability as it advects through the
   domain. A single well leakage scenario is used as an example and to
   perform a sensitivity study for a range of conditions.
   Results show that the initial fracture conductivity, retardation
   factors, and empirical parameters that describe permeability decrease
   are the dominant parameters in the model. These parameters determine
   time to breakthrough of reservoir fluid and amount of fluid leaked at 50
   years. For most cases the breakthrough time and total amount leaked are
   orders of magnitude less than when compared to the constant permeability
   case. Even when residence time is small (i.e. when leak length is short
   and aperture is large) the model shows significantly less fluid leaked
   into an overlying aquifer. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Supercritical CO2 has good mobility and certain heat capacity, which can
   be used as an alternative of water for heat recovery from geothermal
   reservoirs, meanwhile trapping most of injected CO2 underground to
   achieve environmental benefits. In this paper, different types of
   geothermal resources are assessed to screen reservoirs suitable for
   geological storage and heat mining by CO2 injection, in terms of
   geological properties, heat characteristics, storage applicability, and
   development prospects, etc. Deep saline aquifer, geopressured reservoir
   and hot dry rock are selected as the potential sites, mainly due to
   their relatively positive geological conditions for CO2 circulation and
   storage. Reservoir simulations are conducted to analyze the storage
   efficiency and heat extracting capacity of CO2 in the promising
   geothermal reservoirs. A simple calculation method is presented to
   estimate the potentials of CO2 storage and heat mining in the major
   prospective geothermal regions of China. The preliminary assessment
   oresults show that the recoverable geothermal potential by CO2 injection
   in China is around 1.55x10(21) J with hot dry rocks as the main
   contributor. The corresponding CO2 storage capacity is up to 3.53x10(14)
   kg with the deep saline aquifers accounting for more than 50\%. CO2
   injection for geothermal production is a more attractive option than
   pure CO2 storage due to its higher economic benefits in spite of that
   many technological and economic issues still need to be solved in the

Abstract = {{The design of switchable amine surfactants for CO2 EOR in carbonate
   reservoirs at high temperatures is challenging because of the increase
   in the pH due to dissolution of calcium carbonate at acidic conditions.
   The increased pH hinders the protonation of the surfactant and its
   aqueous solubility. In this work, the addition of a second amine
   headgroup ensured that C16-18 N(EO) C3N(EO)(2) is soluble in 22\% TDS
   brine at neutral pH conditions. Also, captive bubble tensiometry
   measurements confirmed the activity of the surfactant at the C-W
   interface by large reduction in the interfacial tension coupled with
   high adsorption. Also, the surfactant generated viscous foam that can
   stabilize the displacement front in CO2 EOR processes and decrease the
   mobility of CO2 for enhanced CO2 sequestration. Published by Elsevier

   in and around Cu TSVs in 3D stacked chips is studied by scanning white
   beam x-ray microdiffraction. The x-ray microdiffraction measurements
   were conducted on different die levels in the stacked chips before and
   after HTS test. High resolution mappings of stress distribution were
   obtained and compared between pre-HTS and post-HTS for both the Cu via
   and the surrounding Si. The x-ray microdiffraction technique provides a
   means for non-destructive, direct stress measurement in a 3D die stack
   structure. Finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out for the test
   structure to interpret the measurement results and to discuss the
   thermal aging effect on the 3D chip. Overall, the results show reduced
   stress in both Cu and Si after HTS, which can be explained by stress
   relaxation occurred during HTS. The implication of the HTS results on
   long term reliability of 3D die stacks is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{RF-MEMS devices area complex systems governed by the interaction of a
   variety of forces, including electrostatics, solid deformation, fluid
   damping and contact. The performance and reliability of these devices is
   strongly dependent on device geometry and composition, and also on
   material microstructure and related properties. In this paper, we
   consider multiscale simulation of RF MEMS switched. At the device level,
   we introduce a comprehensive integrated numerical framework to simulate
   the major governing physics and their interactions. At the micron scale,
   we develop a mesoscale contact model to describe the history-dependent
   force-displacement relationships in terms of the surface roughness, the
   long-range attractive interaction between the two surfaces, and the
   repulsive interaction between contacting asperities (including elastic
   and plastic deformation). The inputs to this model are obtained from
   atomic level simulations and nanoscale surface topography
   characterization. The mesoscale contact model is integrated in the
   device-level simulation to predict the pull-in and pull-out behavior of
   these switches. The uncertainties associated with the simulation are
   quantified and propagated using a non-intrusive collocation method based
   on generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansions. With such a framework,
   we are able to predict the PDFs of pull-in and pull-out voltage,
   identify the critical factors that have the most influence on the
   quantities of interest, and therefore guide resource allocation and
   risk-informed decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates control of stick-slip oscillations in drilling
   from a linear matrix inequality perspective. Stick-slip oscillations
   include a period of no angular motion at the bit caused by a large
   static friction torque followed by a period of rapid angular motion at
   the bit caused by a build up of torque in the drilling pipe. Many of the
   model parameters are uncertain but belong to convex sets, and the
   friction torques are not easily modeled. The linear matrix inequality
   approach facilitates design of state feedback controllers in the
   presence of polytopic uncertainties and can be optimized to reject
   disturbance effects relative to outputs. Results indicate that the
   linear matrix inequality approach leads to a simple controller,
   successfully alleviates the stick-slip problem, and is robust to

Abstract = {{The class of buildings designated as commercial is comprised of many
   different architectures and functions, which presents a challenge when
   developing demand management strategies that are applicable across this
   field. Most advanced controllers are based on a model of the thermal
   loads in the building envelope. These models do not directly extrapolate
   to measures of power consumption, which is what building owners are
   ultimately interested in managing. In this work, we develop models of
   power use that can be easily tailored to model power demand in any
   commercial building with advanced sensing and metering. We address how
   existing models of the building temperature states can be incorporated
   into our framework. Specifically, we show how Auto-Regressive models
   with eXogeneous (ARX) inputs can be used for superior day-ahead
   forecasting of demand, and how to formulate the models in a way that is
   meaningful at the supervisory level. These models provide more
   flexibility in the design of a supervisory controller for building
   energy management and the information they provide is crucial for
   bridging the gap between buildings and utilities in the smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{The development of control strategies that allow stiff industrial robots
   to operate safely in unstructured environments is a significant
   challenge. This paper integrates two strategies that improve safety for
   industrial manipulators in uncertain conditions. First, software
   compliance in the task space is implemented using force feedback.
   End-effector compliance is vital for many tasks, such as interacting
   with humans or manipulating uncertain payloads. Beyond compliance, a
   collision detection algorithm detects collisions based on joint torque
   deviation from a dynamic model. Collisions can be detected at any point
   along the manipulator via loading or impulse anomalies. Joint torque
   data is typically noisy, and the accuracy of the robot dynamic model is
   limited, so an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was developed to improve the
   torque estimates. Experiments and demonstrations were performed using a
   commercially available 7DOF industrial robot. The EKF improved collision
   detection during unplanned contact tasks, and the method described here
   is hardware agnostic and extensible.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the effects of damping and stiffness feedback loop
   latencies on closed-loop system stability and performance. Phase margin
   stability analysis, step response performance and tracking accuracy are
   respectively simulated for a rigid actuator with impedance control. Both
   system stability and tracking performance are more sensitive to damping
   feedback than stiffness feedback latencies. Several comparative tests
   are simulated and experimentally implemented on a real-world actuator to
   verify our conclusion. This discrepancy in sensitivity motivates the
   necessity of implementing embedded damping, in which damping feedback is
   implemented locally at the low level joint controller A direct benefit
   of this distributed impedance control strategy is the enhancement of
   closed-loop system stability. Using this strategy, feedback effort and
   thus closed-loop actuator impedance may be increased beyond the levels
   possible for a monolithic impedance controller High impedance is
   desirable to minimize tracking error in the presence of disturbances.
   Specially, trajectory tracking accuracy is tested by a fast swing and a
   slow stance motion of a knee joint emulating NASA-JSC's Valkyrie legged
   robot. When damping latencies are lowered beyond stiffness latencies,
   gravitational disturbance is rejected, thus demonstrating the accurate
   tracking performance enabled by a distributed impedance controller.}},

Abstract = {{Remelting is used in the production of superalloy ingots. In these
   processes, stabilization of the solidification front is crucial in the
   prevention of segregation defects. However models that account for
   solidification dynamics often are distributed-parameter multi-physics
   models that are not used in process control due to their complexity.
   This paper outlines model reduction for a remelting process based on a
   multi-physics finite volume model. A reduced-order model is constructed
   from a state-space realization where only transport phenomena are
   included. Balancing-free square-root singular perturbation approximation
   is used to construct a minimal reduced system, and then modal
   residualization is performed to remove modes that lie outside of the
   bandwidth of the actuators. The obtained reduced-order model was used to
   design an LQG controller Simulation results verify that using the
   proposed reduced-order model for estimation and control can result in
   more accurate solidification control, when compared to a simplified
   model that accounts only for thermal processes.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the implementation of impedance control based on a position
   sensor in a wearable robot designed for rehabilitation. The first goal
   is to achieve the lowest possible impedance for the robot, with only a
   position sensor and an ON/OFF type pressure sensor, so that it is
   dynamically transparent to the user. We built a wearable robot for
   controlling the user's arm with a brushless DC motor and a two-stage
   gearing system involving a planetary gearbox and a Capstan drive. We
   designed and implemented a controller to compensate for the inherent
   friction and reflected inertia using joint angle feedback from the
   robot, and for the stiction using the user's intended direction detected
   by a pressure sensor Stability conditions are analyzed first for the
   robotic system alone and then for the coupled human-robot system.
   Experiments with the robot show that the apparent impedance was
   significantly reduced with compensation. Experiments involving free
   motions driven by a user proved that the user's physical effort to move
   the robot is dramatically decreased with compensation, thus making the
   robot feel lighter to the user.}},

Abstract = {{As well designs become increasingly complicated, a complete
   understanding of drillstring vibrations is key to maximize drilling
   efficiency and reduce bit wear as well as prevent drill string, tool,
   and borehole damage. This paper presents a review of the past fifty
   years of work on drillstring dynamics models and the proposed and
   accepted vibration mitigation applications within the drilling industry.
   Early modeling began with simplistic models in efforts to understand
   downhole processes. Once downhole sensors were deployed and the basic
   modes of vibration were understood, proprietary systems were developed
   and only recently successfully deployed to detect and mitigate the
   effects of certain undesired vibrational modes, specifically stick-slip
   torsional vibrations. Future systems and their effectiveness will depend
   on a refined understanding of the various modes of vibration and their
   interaction, as well as improved real-time downhole sensing techniques.
   Implementation of high-fidelity models to deduce and correct the
   downhole drillstring state will subsequently improve the operational
   drilling efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue life of ultrasonically welded lithium-ion battery tab joints
   is studied for electric and hybrid-electric vehicle applications.
   Similar to metallic materials, the electrical resistance of these
   ultrasonic welds strongly depends on their quality and the crack growth
   under fatigue loading. A fatigue life model is developed using the
   continuum damage mechanics formulation, where the damage variable is
   defined using the electrical resistance of ultrasonic welds. Fatigue
   tests under various loading conditions are conducted with
   aluminum-copper battery tab joints made under various ultrasonic welding
   conditions. It is shown that the electrical resistance of ultrasonic
   welds increases characteristically during the fatigue life test. There
   is a threshold for the damage variable, after which the ultrasound welds
   fail rapidly. Due to welding process variation, welds made under the
   same process settings may have different fatigue performance. This
   quality difference may be classified using two parameters estimated from
   the fatigue life model. By monitoring the electrical resistance, it is
   possible to predict the remaining life of ultrasonically welded battery
   tab joints using only a portion of the fatigue test data. The prediction
   is more reliable by incorporating data beyond the half-life of the
   joints during the fatigue test.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy logic controllers are well known for robustness and performance,
   and it has been proven that fuzzy logic controllers can approximate an
   optimal controller with arbitrary accuracy. However, adapting fuzzy rule
   bases towards an optimal solution has proven challenging. This paper
   describes a new adaptive algorithm for a fuzzy logic controller.
   Previously studied adaptive algorithms such as Lyapunov methods and
   neural-network methods effectively reduce error, but they are complex
   and potentially distort the rule base so that it loses robustness. The
   proposed method ``shapes{''} the fuzzy rule base as a normal
   distribution to maintain robustness. The algorithm is tested on a
   robotic clamping operation; in three experiments, it reduced the error
   variance by 35\%, 44\%, and 53\%.}},

Abstract = {{Luminance discrepancies between image pairs occur owing to inconsistent
   parameters between stereoscopic camera devices and from imperfect
   capture conditions. Such discrepancies induce binocular mismatches and
   affect the visual comfort that is felt by viewers, as well as their
   ability to fuse stereoscopic. To better understand and observe this
   effect, we built a stereoscopic images database of 240 luminance
   discrepancy images and 30 natural images with subjective scores of
   visual discomfort and fusion difficulty. Two features, binocular
   contrast and luminance similarity were extracted to analyze the
   relationship between the subjective scores and the luminance
   discrepancies. Structural dissimilarity and average luminance are used
   to predict the effects of binocular mismatches. The experimental results
   show that the combination of binocular contrast, structural
   dissimilarity and average luminance exhibits high consistency with
   subjective scores of visual discomfort, fusion difficulty and overall
   binocular mismatches in terms of Spearman's Rank Ordered Correlation

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the results of computational and experimental
   studies of an enhanced thin film solar structure. The cell structure
   consists of a reflective aluminum layer beneath an 80nm absorbing layer
   of amorphous silicon, coated with a top layer of transparent and
   conductive indium tin oxide (ITO). The structure is mounted on a glass
   substrate. We first use constrained optimization techniques along with
   numerical solvers of the electromagnetic equations to specify the layer
   thicknesses of the design for maximized efficiency. Numerical analysis
   suggests that solar absorptivity in the thin film silicon can be
   enhanced by a factor of 2. The proposed design is then fabricated using
   Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition techniques, along with a
   control sample of bare silicon absorber for comparison. AFM imaging and
   spectrophotometry experiments are applied to estimate the realized thin
   film dimensions, deposition error, unwanted oxidation volume and the
   resulting reflectivity spectra. Comparisons of the measured and
   simulated reflectivity spectra of the fabricated cells, as well as Monte
   Carlo simulations based on incorporating random geometry errors in the
   numerical simulations suggest that the measured spectra are in
   accordance with the expected curves from simulations.}},

Abstract = {{As plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) grow in popularity, there is
   increasing research interest in the interaction between PEVs and the
   electric grid. Much of the previous work in the literature relies on an
   assumption that PEV charging will be scheduled, and that the duration
   and magnitude of charging loads can be modulated to suit the needs of
   the utility and the system operator While access to the data or owner
   input necessary for charge scheduling and management might be
   technically feasible today, it is unclear whether vehicle owners will be
   amenable to providing these data or accepting utility control of their
   charging choices.
   Because of these uncertainties in the future relationship between
   electric utilities and PEV owners, this study seeks to examine the
   market effects of vehicles in the absence of the additional data
   utilities would need to realize these alternate, ``optimal{''} PEV
   charging scenarios. In particular, this study focuses on quantifying the
   potential uncertainty in vehicle charging loads on an energy and power
   basis.
   Monte Carlo methods were applied to vehicle trip data from the National
   Household Travel Survey (NHTS) to generate simulated driving profiles
   for individual vehicles. Using these profiles, six PEV fleet sizes were
   studied, ranging from 1,000 to 500,000 vehicles, to determine whether
   fleet size had a linear effect on the stochasticity of vehicle charging
   loads. Following the Monte Carlo simulations, these loads were examined
   independent of and compared to net load (load minus wind generation).
   Results from the Monte Carlo simulations indicate that even for the
   largest PEV fleet sizes studied, variability in average charging loads
   is on the order of 10 MW, less than 0.2\% of the magnitude of charging
   load for those fleet sizes. In comparison with electricity demand in the
   Electric Reliability Council of Texas' (ERCOT) operating area, these
   charging loads represent a 1\% increase above typical summer peak loads.
   Unfortunately, while the relative increase in demand is small, the
   timing of peak charging load is nearly coincident with summer peak
   demand.
   The simulation approach was validated by comparing the results against
   empirical vehicle charging data collected by the Pecan Street Research
   Consortium from households in Austin, Texas. Simulated and empirical
   vehicle charging trends showed generally good agreement, with similar
   charging times but slightly different charging durations. The alignment
   between the two charging profiles indicates that the simulation
   methodology applied here with NHTS travel data can be used to predict
   electric load for vehicle charging when empirical historical charging
   data are not available.}},

   reactors can produce non-equilibrium plasmas and can be a promising

   early stages. In order to understand the effects of major design and
   operational parameters on the reactor performance a MHCD system was
   modeled and simulated. In this study, different types of dielectrics
   including mica, alumina, acrylic and quartz were used, and applied DC
   voltage was varied from 250 to 10,000 V. First the operating voltage
   regions of this reactor were determined based on the breakdown
   thresholds of the dielectric and gas phase. Then, the effects of applied
   voltage on the discharge volume and power requirement of operation were
   determined. Results showed that the reactor with mica as the dielectric
   material showed the largest operating voltage range, as well as the
   highest power requirement. In addition, the discharge volume increased
   with applied voltage and it was possible to discharge about 96\% of the
   gas in the MHCD reactor with mica at 10 kV.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an experimental study on dissociation of carbon
   dioxide using a microdischarge plasma reactor at ambient conditions.
   Carbon dioxide contributes to more than 80\% of the greenhouse gas
   emissions in United States. The microdischarge plasmas can be a very
   promising method in dissociating gases, including carbon dioxide, due to
   their lack of need for catalysts, operating at temperatures lower than
   conventional thermochemical dissociation processes and ease of
   operation. A microhollow cathode discharge plasma reactor was designed
   and prototyped for CO2 dissociation. The reactor included metal
   electrodes that were attached to both sides of a dielectric material
   with a micro-size through hole. The electrodes and the dielectric
   material were placed perpendicular to flow direction for dissociation to
   occur as carbon dioxide passed through the hole. A set of experiments
   were conducted to investigate the effect of flow rate and applied
   voltage on the composition of the products, energy conversion efficiency
   and CO2-to-CO conversion yield of the microdischarge plasma reactor.
   Temperature of reactants and products were continuously measured;
   applied voltage was set using a high-voltage power supply; and molar
   composition of products for each case was analyzed using gas
   chromatography. Results showed that CO2 dissociation rate, energy
   conversion efficiency and CO2-to-CO conversion yield increased with
   applied voltage. Moreover, CO2 dissociation rate and conversion yield
   decreased while energy conversion efficiency increased with increasing
   flow rate.}},

   resulted in damages and contamination clean up efforts reported at
   \$1,232,000 (\$8.5 million in 2012 dollars) {[}1]. Fire suppression
   systems are therefore a key aspect to glovebox safety. Use of water
   based systems generally result in undesired transport of hazardous
   materials {[}2]. Halon suppression systems were used but due to its
   large potential to deplete ozone was phased out in the latter part of
   the 20th century. Activation tests of a commercial automatic fire
   suppression system (Fire Foe (TM)) containing heptaflouropropane (FE-36)
   fire suppressant were conducted within a glovebox at the University of
   Texas Fire Research Group's burn structure. Ten tests were conducted at
   four different fire sizes: three 13 kW, one 20 kW, three 25 kW and three
   50 kW. Activation times and gas temperatures were recorded. Gas
   temperatures from experiments were compared against NIST's Fire Dynamics
   Simulator (FDS) gas temperatures with good agreement. More
   stratification was observed in experimental temperatures compared to FDS
   temperatures. The time and spatially averaged net heat flux on a virtual
   Fire Foe (TM) tube from the FDS simulations were passed to a
   thermo-physical semi-empirical submodel to predict activation. The
   submodel did not capture the exponential nature observed in the data of
   activation times versus fire heat release rate. Work is continuing on
   improving the submodel to capture the observed events.}},

Abstract = {{We examined numerical and experimental use of a coupled-transducer
   system comprised of a thermocouple temperature measurements and time of
   flight acoustic measurements to determine the recession rate of a carbon
   material. A problem in the use of ultrasonic transducers for high
   temperature thickness measurements is that the temperature of the
   specimen is not always known. The variation of the speed of sound with
   temperature makes this a challenging problem and the use of a limited
   number of temperature measurements helps to construct a temperature
   profile on which the acoustic time of flight measurement can be
   characterized. In the problem of interest, a high heat flux is directed
   towards the surface of a carbon based material. A temperature profile is
   set up in the material. Initially the heated face simply increases in
   temperature with no mass loss. With increasing heating and oxygen
   transport to the surface, the hot face begins to oxidatively erode.
   Temperature measurements Y(x(i)) are made at xi locations within the
   material. At the same time a time of flight measurement is made in the
   material. We can assume that the time of flight measurement takes place
   over a time period that is small relative to the time for which the
   spatial temperature variation evolves. As such, the time of flight
   measurement primarily involves a weighted spatial integration of a
   function of temperature. Given the temperature measurements and the time
   of flight measurement, we seek the recession rate or equivalently, the
   sample length. We develop a simple thermal model with appropriate
   representation of oxidation kinetics to describe the process. A simple
   inversion analysis is developed and tested on synthetic data to best fit
   the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a numerical study on the discharge of carbon dioxide
   using a non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor at
   ambient conditions. DBD plasma reactors have been used for various
   applications due to their ease of production, process control, operation
   at different conditions. The applications of DBD plasma reactors include
   discharge of gases. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas formed as a
   byproduct of fossil fuel combustion. Use of DBD non-thermal plasma
   reactor can be a promising technology for carbon dioxide mitigation due
   to its operation at low temperatures, lack of need for catalysts, and
   flexibility in controlling the products generated. In this study, a
   tubular DBD non-thermal plasma reactor was modeled with different
   electrode materials separated by different dielectric materials. The aim
   was to provide guidelines for the design and material selection for
   optimizing DBD plasma reactors for CO2 discharge. A parametric set of
   simulations was performed using a finite element solver to investigate
   how electrode and dielectric materials affect the discharge volume of
   CO2 and power requirement of the non-thermal plasma discharge of CO2.
   The results showed that electrode material did not affect the discharge
   or the power requirement. However, dielectric material with higher
   permittivity or lower conductivity increased the gas discharge and power
   requirement. Among the analyzed materials, aluminum electrode and mica
   tube were suggested based on the simulation results for the maximum gas
   discharge and low power requirement.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of lithium ion batteries on a cell level are usually
   performed with volume averaging methods that employ effective transport
   properties. Bruggeman's model, which is widely used to determine these
   effective properties, is solely based on the volume fraction of these
   porous electrodes. However, other factors like the topology and
   microstructure of electrodes also play a crucial role in determining
   effective properties. In this paper, a general derivation of the
   effective thermal conductivity of multiphase materials, which can be
   correlated with these factors, is derived using the volume averaging
   technique. For demonstration, three-dimensional microstructures of
   various porous materials are reconstructed from scanned images. These
   images are used to generate fully-resolved finite volume meshes
   representing the various constituents. The resulting mesh is then
   employed for numerical analysis of thermal transport, results from which
   are used for correlating the effective thermal conductivity with various
   parameters describing the microstructure. It is shown that commonly used
   power law exponents in the Bruggeman model for effective thermal
   conductivity must be re-calibrated to fit the effective thermal
   conductivity computed from these detailed simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a RGB-D indoor scene recognition method that
   has mainly two advantages as compared to existing methods. First, by
   training object detectors using RGB-D images and recognizing their
   spatial interrelationships, we not only achieve better object
   localization accuracy than using RGB images alone, but also obtain
   details as to how the objects are related to each other in a spatial
   manner, thus resulting in a more effective high-level feature
   representation of the scene known as the Objects and Attributes (O\&A)
   representation. Second, we learn class-specific sub-dictionaries that
   capture the high-order couplings between the objects and attributes. In
   particular, elastic net regularization and geometric similarity
   constraint is imposed to increase the discriminative power of the
   sub-dictionaries. The proposed method is evaluated on two RGB-D
   datasets, the NYUD dataset and the B3DO dataset. Experiments show that
   superior scene recognition rate can be obtained using our method.}},

Abstract = {{Humidification membranes are vital to maintaining optimal operation
   conditions in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Dry inlet
   air must be humidified to achieve an efficient reaction within the fuel

   membranes due to its excellent water transport properties. However, the
   performance of Nafion comes at a high cost (similar to \$1000/m(2)).
   There is a need to reduce membrane cost by developing an alternative
   material. The first step in developing a new membrane material is
   characterization of membrane performance. A humidification membrane
   measurement system was developed to determine vapor mass transfer rates
   through Nafion humidification membranes. The system creates a controlled
   environment where inlet water flow, air flow, temperature and pressure
   are regulated in order to measure the permeation rate of water through a

Abstract = {{The recent drought in Texas revealed the vulnerability of curtailment
   for some power plants due to cooling water supplies being too hot.
   Assessing the risk of reduced operations at thermoelectric power plants
   associated with thermal discharge limits, as well the potential for
   cooperation between power plants, can increase the resiliency of the
   electricity grid in Texas and aid future planning. This evaluation
   compares the observed effluent discharge water temperatures from
   thermoelectric power plants in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
   (ERCOT) interconnection with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   discharge temperature limits. Results indicate that at least two major
   power plants representing over 3,000 MW of cumulative generation
   capacity have operated at or near these temperature limits in the past.
   Predicted warming from heat waves, droughts, or climate change might
   increase ambient air temperature (one of the primary factors affecting
   effluent temperature) causing even higher derating in the future.
   We modeled current and future average monthly cooling water effluent
   temperature for open loop and recirculating cooling pond systems in
   ERCOT using current climate data and predictions of ambient air
   temperature, electricity generation, dew point, and wind speed for
   2027-2032. While there are some power plants that are projected to be
   exposed to thermal effluent-related curtailment, we estimate that there
   is six times as much electricity generation potential available from
   other existing generators that can meet demand without reaching thermal
   effluent temperature limits. That is, this work's analysis indicates
   that other existing power plants could generate additional electricity
   to offset the curtailment of the particular power plants at greatest
   risk from derating to maintain grid reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Nationally, 4\% of electricity usage goes towards moving and treating
   water and wastewater. The energy intensity of the water and wastewater
   utility sector is affected by many factors including water source, water
   quality, and the distance and elevation that water must be transported

   significant cost savings. Better knowledge of where and when energy is
   used could support strategic energy interventions and reveal
   opportunities for efficiency. Accordingly, this investigation quantifies
   energy intensity by process and type, including electricity and natural
   gas, and explores the time-varying nature of electric energy consumption
   for potable water distribution using the Austin Water Utility (AWU) in
   Austin, Texas as a case study. This research found that most of energy

Abstract = {{Air. conditioning systems (AC systems) are the primary driver of summer
   electricity use and peak power demand in residential homes in Texas,
   mostly due to the refrigerant compressor in the condenser unit. The
   power demand for a residential AC compressor is on the order of
   kilowatts. Peak power demand from residential AC systems could be
   reduced by means of precooling a thermal storage reservoir, which can be
   used as a heat sink instead of the air-cooled outdoor condenser that is
   subject to ambient conditions. The concept of thermal storage is not
   new, and is in widespread use in large-scale HVAC systems for the
   commercial and industrial sectors. However, residential thermal storage
   systems, while available, are not widespread due to high costs relative
   to the costs of the AC system.
   This paper discusses the development of a simplified thermodynamic model
   of a water-based sensible thermal storage reservoir for reducing peak AC
   compressor loads, and determines optimal tank sizing based on a few key
   design parameters. The motivation behind this project is the idea of
   utilizing a large water reservoir that could be on-site for other
   purposes already, specifically large rainwater collection systems. Such
   a combined energy/water storage configuration might increase the cost
   effectiveness of both a thermal storage system and a rainwater
   collection system by means of shared costs and avoided energy and water
   expenses.
   The system configuration consists of a typical direct expansion
   residential air conditioning system with a typical air-cooled condenser
   unit, but with an additional thermal storage condenser/evaporator heat
   exchanger connected into the refrigerant lines with reconfigurable flow
   paths and solenoid valves to control the discharging and recharging of
   the thermal reservoir. The large volume of stored water acts as a lower
   temperature thermal reservoir for the secondary condenser. The lower
   temperature and better heat transfer capabilities of water improve
   operating efficiency and reduce power consumption when used instead of
   the air-cooled condenser during the hottest hours of the day.
   The system model was evaluated using cooling load outputs for a
   simulated 1800 square foot home in Austin, Texas based on weather data
   from summer 2011, which was a record hot summer that stressed the Texas
   electricity grid to its limits. Preliminary analysis based on a
   simplified model of the system, along with the specified model
   parameters, suggests that thermal storage systems would be on the order
   of several thousand gallons, which corresponds to that of a large

   power demand reduction during peak is likely the primary benefit of the
   system, with an average reduction on the order of 30-70\% less than the
   system without storage, depending on operating parameters. However,
   total energy consumption could be either slightly higher or lower than
   the baseline, depending on a variety of factors such as diurnal

Abstract = {{When firefighters are overcome by the heat or smoke of a fire and become
   disoriented or trapped in a structure, it is crucial that there is a
   reliable means to alert other fireground personnel to their need for
   assistance. Personal Alert Safety System (PASS) devices are designed to
   signal for aid using audible signal technology. Normal operation is for
   the PASS devices to activate a 95-decibel multiple-frequency alarm
   signal if the device is stationary for a specific period of time or is
   manually activated. However, despite its widespread use throughout the
   fire service and on-going enhancements in recent years, certain problems
   still exist with audible PASS technology. Foremost among these problems
   is that nationally recognized standards currently do not specify a
   unique PASS alarm signal, and this has resulted in multiple different
   PASS alarms being used in the field. In this work, we present results
   that seek to establish a scientific basis for an optimum PASS alarm
   signal for use throughout the U.S fire service. We present typical
   sounds recorded from firefighter operations. We discuss how these sounds
   interfere with typical PASS signals both in compartments with and
   without fire. Using experimental and computational results for sound
   propagation within compartments with fire and thermal stratification, we
   show how acoustic signals are modified and affected in the gas phase by
   the fire evolution. Additionally, the effects of thermal degradation of
   typical building materials such as gypsum board is discussed in terms of
   the impacts on sound propagation.}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy is typically used to characterize graphene in
   experiments and also to measure properties like thermal conductivity and
   optical phonon lifetime. The laser-irradiation processes underlying this
   measurement technique include coupling between photons, electrons and
   phonons. Recent experimental studies have shown that e-ph scattering
   limits the performance of graphene-based electronic devices due to the
   difference in their timescales of relaxation resulting in various
   bottleneck effects. Furthermore, recently published thermal conductivity
   measurements on graphene are sensitive to the laser spot size which
   strengthens the possibility of non-equilibrium between various phonon
   groups. These studies point to the need to study the spatially-resolved
   non-equilibrium between various energy carriers in graphene. In this
   work, we demonstrate non-equilibrium in the e-ph interactions in
   graphene by solving the linearized electron and phonon Boltzmann
   transport equations (BTE) iteratively under steady state conditions. We
   start by assuming that all the electrons equilibrate rapidly to an
   elevated temperature under laser-irradiation and they gradually relax by
   phonon emission and reach a steady state. The-electron and phonon BTEs
   are coupled because the e-ph scattering rate depends on the phonon
   population while the rate of phonon generation depends on the e-ph
   scattering rate. We used density-functional theory/density-functional
   perturbation theory (DFT/DFPT) to calculate the electronic eigen states,
   phonon frequencies and the e-ph coupling matrix elements. (1)We
   calculated the rate of energy loss from the hot electrons in terms of
   the phonon generation rate (PGR) which serve as an input for solving the
   BTE. Likewise, ph-ph relaxation times are calculated from the anharmonic
   lattice dynamics (LD)/FGR. Through our work, we obtained the spatially
   resolved temperature profiles of all the relevant energy carriers
   throughout the entire domain; these are impossible to obtain through
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling thermal conductivity of materials is very important in
   various applications, such as thermal management and energy conversion.
   We have been utilizing femtosecond phonon spectroscopy to excite and
   detect coherent phonons in various materials. However, the impact of
   coherent phonons to overall heat transport is still unknown. In this
   paper, we developed a small perturbation model in molecular dynamics
   (MD) to simulate coherent phonons and investigate the effect on thermal
   conductivity in bismuth telluride. The phonon frequency and lifetime
   predicted by our model agree very well with experimental results. It is
   found that at very low temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity,
   predicted by quasi-equilibrium Green-Kubo method, can be greatly
   enhanced upon coherent phonon generation. Our results suggest that it is
   possible to control lattice thermal conductivity effectively via
   manipulating coherent phonons}},

Abstract = {{Mobile computing increasingly often entails applications that embody
   opportunistic or delay-tolerant communication, and while much work has
   focused on refining and optimizing the technical underpinnings for
   providing delay-tolerant communication constructs, there is almost a
   complete lack of support for integrating opportunistic communication
   functionality at the application level. This paper introduces MadApp, an
   application-level development framework that provides tailored
   abstractions and support infrastructure for creating dynamic web pages
   that can incorporate received content from various opportunistic
   communication channels on-the-fly. We describe multiple application
   scenarios in which these constructs can seamlessly apply, and provide a
   complete conceptual and concrete architecture and implementation for
   MadApp. We evaluate MadApp's support for opportunistic mobile computing
   web applications using two different mobility trace data sets collected
   from the real-world. This paper demonstrates that MadApp enables
   opportunistic mobile computing applications to begin to leverage the
   significant advances in delay-tolerant communication research, opening
   doors for even more dynamic and adaptive applications.}},

Abstract = {{A Command and Data Handling (C\&DH) system is being developed as part of
   a series of CubeSat missions being built at the University of Texas at
   Austin Texas Spacecraft Laboratory (TSL). With concurrent development of
   four missions and with more missions planned for the future, the C\&DH
   team is developing a system architecture that can support a variety of
   mission requirements. The presented research aims to establish a
   reference for the development of the C\&DH system architecture so that
   it can be reused for future university missions.
   The C\&DH system is designed using a centralized architecture with one
   main flight computer controlling the actions and the state of the
   satellite. A commercial off-the-shelf system-on-module embedded computer
   running a Linux environment hosted on an interface board designed
   in-house is used as the platform for the mission software. An integral
   component of the C\&DH system development is the flight software (FSW).
   The FSW is written in C++ using the Object-oriented architectural style.
   It is structured as a state machine, controlling the transitioning of
   the satellite between its operational modes which define its actions and
   behaviour. The various testing procedures that are performed on the FSW,
   the C\&DH system and the integrated satellite are described. These
   procedures include traditional software tests such as black box, glass
   box, and unit testing, as well as formal spacecraft tests such as
   Command Execution Tests and Day-in-the-Life tests.
   The design of the flight software and the associated hardware are
   integral components of the current missions in the TSL which, when
   flown, will be some of the most operationally complex CubeSat missions
   attempted to date.}},

Abstract = {{The Autonomous Ascent and Descent Powered-Flight Testbed (ADAPT) is a
   closed-loop, free-flying testbed for demonstrating descent and landing
   technologies of next-generation planetary landers. The free-flying
   vehicle is the Masten Space Systems Xombie vertical-takeoff,
   vertical-landing suborbital rocket. A specific technology ADAPT is
   demonstrating in the near-term is Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large
   Diverts (G-FOLD), a fuel-optimal trajectory planner for diverts during
   powered descent, which is the final kilometers of descent to landing on
   rocket engines.
   Previously, ADAPT used Xombie to fly optimal large-divert trajectories,
   extending Xombie's divert range to 750 m. However, these trajectories
   were planned off-line with G-FOLD. This paper reports the successful
   Xombie flight demonstrations of large diverts using G-FOLD on board to
   calculate divert trajectories in real time while descending. The
   culminant test flight of the last year was an 800 m divert that was
   initiated at an altitude of 290 m while moving away from and crosswise
   to the landing pad. Hence, G-FOLD had to calculate a constrained divert
   trajectory that reversed direction, was fully three-dimensional, with
   horizontal motion nearly three times the initial altitude, and it did so
   in similar to 100 ms on board Xombie as it was descending. Xombie then
   flew the divert trajectory with meter-level precision, demonstrating
   that G-FOLD had planned a trajectory respecting all the constraints of
   the rocket-powered vehicle. The steps to reach this flight demonstration
   of on-board generation of optimal divert trajectories and the system
   engineering for future ADAPT payloads are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{To exploit unknown ambient radio frequency signals of opportunity (SOPs)
   for positioning and navigation, one must estimate their states along
   with a set of parameters that characterize the stability of their
   oscillators. SOPs can be modeled as stochastic dynamical systems driven
   by process noise. The statistics of such process noise is typically
   unknown to the receiver wanting to exploit the SOPs for positioning and
   navigation. Incorrect statistical models jeopardize the estimation
   optimality and may cause filter divergence. This necessitates the
   development of adaptive filters, which provide a significant improvement
   over fixed filters through the filter learning process. This paper
   develops two such adaptive filters: an innovation-based maximum
   likelihood filter and an interacting multiple model filter and compares
   their performance and complexity. Numerical and experimental results are
   presented demonstrating the superiority of these filters over fixed,
   mismatched filters.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the effect of grain structure on TSV extrusion and its
   reliability implication are investigated through experimental
   measurements and modeling analysis. The grain orientation, elastic
   anisotropy and local plasticity are found to be important in controlling
   the extrusion profile which can directly impact the back-end-of-line
   (BEOL) reliability. Results from this study suggest that the Cu
   microstructure should be optimized from both global and local aspects in
   order to minimize the extrusion damage to the 3D structure.}},

Abstract = {{We present the development considerations and design for ground-based
   instrumentation that is being deployed on the East Antarctic Plateau
   along a 40 degrees magnetic meridian chain to investigate
   interhemispheric magnetically conjugate geomagnetic coupling and other
   space-weather-related phenomena. The stations are magnetically conjugate
   to geomagnetic stations along the west coast of Greenland. The
   autonomous adaptive low-power instrument platforms being deployed in the
   Antarctic are designed to operate unattended in remote locations for at
   least 5 years. They utilize solar power and AGM storage batteries for
   power, two-way Iridium satellite communication for data acquisition and
   program/operation modification, support fluxgate and induction
   magnetometers as well as a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a
   high-frequency (HF) radio experiment. Size and weight considerations are
   considered to enable deployment by a small team using small aircraft.
   Considerable experience has been gained in the development and
   deployment of remote polar instrumentation that is reflected in the
   present generation of instrumentation discussed here. We conclude with
   the lessons learned from our experience in the design, deployment and
   operation of remote polar instrumentation.}},
