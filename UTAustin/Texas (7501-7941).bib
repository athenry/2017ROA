Abstract = {{Coal-fired power plants are a source of inexpensive, reliable
   electricity for many countries. Unfortunately, their high carbon dioxide
   (CO2) emissions rates contribute significantly to global climate change.
   With the likelihood of future policies limiting CO2 emissions, CO2
   capture and sequestration (CCS) could allow for the continued use of
   coal while low- and zero-emission generation sources are developed and
   implemented. This work compares the potential impact of flexibly
   operating CO2 capture systems on the economic viability of using CCS in
   gas- and coal-dominated electricity markets. The comparison is made
   using a previously developed modeling framework to analyze two different
   markets: 1) a natural-gas dominated market (the Electric Reliability
   Council of Texas, or ERCOT) and 2) a coal-dominated market (the National
   Electricity Market, or NEM in Australia). The model uses performance and
   economic parameters for each power plant to determine the annual
   generation, CO2 emissions, and operating profits for each plant for
   specified input fuel prices and CO2 emissions costs. Previous studies of
   ERCOT found that flexible CO2 capture operation could improve the
   economic viability of coal-fired power plants with CO2 capture when
   there are opportunities to reduce CO2 capture load and increase
   electrical output when electricity prices are high. The model was used
   to compare the implications of using CO2 capture systems in the two
   electricity systems under CO2 emissions penalties from 0 100 US dollars
   per metric ton of CO2. Half the coal-fired power plants in each grid
   were selected to be considered for a CO2 capture retrofit based on plant
   efficiency, whether or not SO2 scrubbers are already installed on the
   plant, and the plant's proximity to viable sequestration sites. Plants
   considered for CO2 capture systems are compared with and without
   inflexible CO2 capture as well as with two different flexible operation
   strategies. With more coal-fired power plants being dispatched as the
   marginal generator and setting the electricity price in the NEM,
   electricity prices increase faster due to CO2 prices than in ERCOT where
   natural gas-plants typically set the electricity price. The model showed
   moderate CO2 emissions reductions in ERCOT with CO2 capture and no CO2
   price because increased costs at coal-fired power plants led to reduced
   generation. Without CO2 prices, installing CO2 capture on coal-fired
   power plants resulted in moderately reduced CO2 emissions in ERCOT as
   the coal-fired power plants became more expensive and were replaced with
   less expensive natural gas-fired generators. Without changing the makeup
   of the plant fleet in NEM, a CO2 price would not currently promote
   significant replacement of coal-fired power plants because there is
   minimal excess capacity with low CO2 emissions rates that can displace
   existing coal-fired power plants. Additionally, retrofitting CO2 capture
   onto half of the coal-based fleet in NEM did not reduce CO2 emissions
   significantly without CO2 costs being implemented because the plants
   with capture become more expensive and were replaced by the coal-fired
   power plants without CO2 capture.
   Operating profits at NEM capture plants increased as CO2 price increased
   much faster than capture plants in ERCOT. The higher rate of increasing
   profits for plants in NEM is due to the marginal generators in}},

Abstract = {{Previous analyses have concluded that the United State's water sector
   uses over 3\% of national electricity consumption for the production,
   conveyance, and treatment of water and wastewater and as much as 10\%
   when considering the energy required for on-site heating, cooling,
   pumping, and softening of water for end-use. The energy intensity of
   water is influenced by factors such as source water quality, its
   proximity to a water treatment facility and end-use, its intended
   end-use and sanitation level, as well as its conveyance to and treatment
   at a wastewater treatment facility. Since these requirements differ by
   geographic location, climate, season, and local water quality standards,
   the energy consumption of regional water systems vary significantly.
   While national studies have aggregated averages for the energy use and
   energy intensity of various stages of the of the US water system, these
   estimates do not capture the wide disparity between regional water
   systems. For instance, 19 percent of California's total electricity
   generation is used to withdraw, collect, convey, treat, distribute, and
   prepare water for end-use, nearly doubling the national average. Much of
   this electricity is used to move water over high elevations and across
   long distances from water-rich to water-stressed regions of the state.
   Potable water received by users in Southern California has typically
   been pumped as far as 450 miles, and lifted nearly 2000ft over the
   system's highest point in the Tehachapi Mountains. Consequently, the
   energy intensity of San Diego County's water is approximately 11,000 kWh
   per million gallons for pumping treatment and distribution, as compared
   to the US average which is estimated to be in the vicinity of
   1,500-2,000 kWh per million gallons. With added pressures on the state's
   long-haul transfer systems from population growth and growing interest
   in energy-intensive desalination, this margin will likely increase.
   This manuscript consists of a first-order analysis to quantify the
   energy embedded in the US public water supply, which is the primary
   water source to residential, commercial, and municipal users. Our
   analysis finds that energy use associated with the public water supply
   is 4.7\% of the nation's annual primary energy and 6.1\% of national
   electricity consumption, respectively. Public water and wastewater
   pumping, treatment, and distribution, as well as commercial and
   residential water-heating were considered in this preliminary work.
   End-use energy requirements associated with water for municipal,
   industrial, and self-supplied sectors (i.e. agriculture, thermoelectric,
   mining, etc.) were not included in this analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of the U.S. transportation and electricity generation
   sectors include air emissions and water consumption. Information and
   communication technologies (ICT) such as advanced video teleconferencing
   have the potential to displace some activities that have historically
   required transportation. While ICT can reduce environmental impacts
   compared to transportation options in many cases, there are non-obvious
   environmental trade-offs associated with replacing transportation with
   ICT. These tradeoffs are the consequence of many factors, including the
   particular local electricity mix, meeting duration, number of meeting
   participants, travel distances, travel modes, motive transport
   conversion technologies, and transport fuels. Identifying and
   quantifying these trade-offs is the focus of this research.
   For this study, a nomenclature and methodology were developed to compare
   environmental trade-offs associated with transportation and ICT. The
   nomenclature was designed to facilitate side-by-side comparison of the
   environmental impacts of travel and ICT and to allow expansion of the
   nomenclature for future study. The methodology considered a variety of
   conversion technologies for motive transport including spark-ignition,
   compression-ignition, fuel cells, and electric motors. Both conventional
   and developing fuels were considered including gasoline, ethanol,
   diesel, biodiesel, natural gas, hydrogen, and electricity. Likewise,
   electricity consumption for ICT included both traditional and developing
   electricity generation technologies. Carbon dioxide emissions and water
   consumption for ICT were assessed for comparison with transportation in
   a case study that demonstrated use of this methodology by considering
   three distinct scenarios for a particular business meeting:
   1. Two meeting attendees travel to the meeting by diesel city bus while
   two travel in a private vehicle.
   2. All four meeting attendees travel by private vehicle powered by
   compressed natural gas.
   3. The four meeting attendees do not travel, but instead meet their
   clients virtually via ICT.
   The case study analyzed in this manuscript considers only the water and
   carbon dioxide impacts, but the nomenclature developed allows future
   expansion for analysis of other greenhouse gases. The three scenarios
   revealed that, compared to short travel distances, use of ICT does not
   always generate fewer carbon dioxide emissions. Depending on the mode of
   electricity generation, travel proved to be preferable from an emissions
   standpoint for scenarios in which travel distances were small. However,
   in cases that required long distances to travel, ICT often allowed
   businesses and individuals to reduce their environmental impacts,
   especially if electric power generation in that location utilized large
   amounts of relatively low-emissions technologies such as hydroelectric
   dams, wind, solar, and nuclear. Finally, it should be noted that, in
   addition to comparing ICT and travel impacts, this methodology can be
   used to calculate the environmental tradeoffs of various transportation
   options when travel is a necessity.}},

Abstract = {{The intermittency of wind and solar power and the mismatch between when
   they are available and when demand is high have hindered the expansion
   of these two primary renewable resources. The goal of this research is
   to analyze an integrated energy system (named DSWiSS for dispatchable
   solar wind storage system) that includes a novel configuration of wind
   and solar together with compressed air energy storage (CAES) that is
   driven from excess nighttime wind energy and thermal storage energized
   by concentrated solar power in order to make these sources dispatchable
   during peak demand. Notably, existing CAES facilities use natural gas
   for heating the compressed air before its expansion through a turbine;
   the system described in this paper replaces the use of natural gas with
   solar energy and thermal storage, thereby obviating the need for fossil
   fuels and yielding a dispatchable system powered completely by renewable
   sources.
   This paper builds off prior published work for the DSWiSS configuration
   with an analysis of temporally-resolved parameters, including wind and
   solar resources, which are important to the operation of DSWiSS. This
   analysis uses actual historical meteorological data for West Texas solar
   insolation, telemetry data for wind power in West Texas, and recorded
   electricity demand data of the ERCOT grid to assess system performance.
   We examined how the daily variation of these parameters could affect the
   operation of an energy storage facility such as DSWiSS.
   We found that the daily fluctuations were most pronounced in the summer
   when demand is highest and wind velocity is lowest. However, because all
   seasons show a time-of-day phase mismatch between demand and wind
   velocity, we expect that a load leveling energy storage technology would
   be useful to the electric grid. Research to be completed soon will
   attempt to use control strategies along with the existing thermodynamic
   model of the DSWiSS power system to determine how DSWiSS would be
   operated differently under the different seasonal situations.}},

   equations which capture the transient characteristics of liquid pool
   shape variations around a quasi-steady operating condition. These
   nonlinear equations are then linearized about this operating condition
   and further simplified by suppressing fast modes. The resulting system
   can be described by only six state variables. The reduced order model
   compares favorably to pool depth changes predicted by an accurate
   finite-volume model. A first approach to use this model in the design of
   a dynamic VAR pool depth estimator and controller is also proposed.}},

   by using a rechargeable battery as the reserve power source. In such an
   integrated wind turbine-battery system, wind turbine controller is
   frequently required to switch between two control modes. We have derived
   linearized approximations of the closed loop wind turbine system for
   both control modes after applying feedback control laws. Stability of
   this linearized switching system is established with the use of Common
   Quadratic Lyapunov Function (CQLF). Limitations on control gains and
   switching conditions required to achieve system stability are discussed.

Abstract = {{Manufacture of fuel cell electrodes by the thin-film method was
   originally proposed by Wilson et al. {[}1, 2] for proton-exchange
   membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This technology was subsequently utilized
   for the manufacture of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) electrodes by
   Ren et al. {[}3]. Key processing steps in the thin-film process are
   catalyst ink formulation and its application. The catalyst ink is
   typically composed of supported or unsupported catalysts, binder
   (ionomer), solvents and additives. Rheological properties of the ink,
   amount of binder, and choice of solvents are tuned to match the
   particular ink application process used to fabricate the electrode, as
   each coating process has its own unique requirements. Besides affecting
   the coating process, the choice and ratios of these components can
   significantly affect the electrochemical performance of the electrode.
   In this study, catalyst inks are designed and investigated for the
   spraying process, for utilization in the continuous fabrication of DMFC
   electrodes. For this purpose, the effect of the binder (ionomer) content
   on the performance of the electrodes is studied in detail.
   Decal-transfer electrodes are fabricated on a custom-built automated
   spraying apparatus with individually specified anode and cathode binder
   contents, and assembled to form a catalyst coated membrane (CCM) type
   membrane electrode assembly (MEA). These electrodes are rigorously
   tested to specifically identify their electrochemical performance,
   catalyst utilization and electrode morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Reactor optimization is central to increasing the efficiency of nuclear
   fuel cycles and critical for making meaningful comparisons between
   different design options. Optimization algorithms work by generating
   trial parameter sets which can be used as inputs to reactor physics
   models. Unfortunately, many reactor physics codes require substantial
   CPU time, making optimization of large parameter sets impractical. We
   have developed a method for finding optima within an N-dimensional
   parameter space using a fast, flexible reactor physics model that is
   capable of performing fuel burnup calculations on the order of once per
   second. Global optima found in this way can then be verified using a
   high fidelity reactor physics code. We demonstrate our approach by
   considering a simple fuel pin pitch optimization for a light-water
   reactor, and we find our code executes in 5 minutes. Repeating this
   approach using a high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulation requires
   approximately 15 days of runtime by contrast.}},

Abstract = {{Interference alignment (IA) is a cooperative transmission technique for
   the interference channel. This paper describes two testbeds that
   implement real-time Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) IA for a
   network with three 2-antenna user pairs using software defined radio
   techniques: a PC-based testbed for rapid prototyping of potential IA
   protocols and an embedded testbed for evaluating IA under real-world
   computational constraints. The IA implementations rely on a wired
   backbone to share global channel state information (CSI) and a shared
   clock for frequency and timing synchronization. The testbeds are used to
   demonstrate the viability of IA, and to compare its robustness with
   several alternative transmission strategies, such as 2 x 2 MIMO TDMA, in
   terms of sum-rates. Results show that we are able to successfully
   achieve over-the-air IA in our three-user 2 x 2 MIMO testbed. The paper
   highlights key challenges with the practical realization of IA that are
   encountered while developing the testbed and identifies areas for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time video streaming over wireless channels suffers from
   channel-induced distortions due to losses and errors as well as
   source-induced distortions due to lossy compression. This paper proposes
   a cross-layer design for quality-driven packet prioritization at the
   physical layer combined with source and link rate adaptation to jointly
   minimize the source and channel distortions. With a MIMO physical layer,
   packet prioritization is achieved by mapping video packets to ordered
   spatial streams to maximize the throughput weighted by the perpacket
   loss visibility. The MIMO mode controls the number of priority levels
   and is dynamically optimized to provide the best tradeoff between high
   source rate and low channel distortion. Jointly with mode adaptation,
   source rate adaptation is driven by the client by estimating the
   end-to-end throughput based on the transmission rate. Results show that
   the proposed design enables composite video quality gains due to
   prioritized delivery and rate adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a low-power consumption dual-path fused
   floating-point add-subtract unit and compares it with previous fused
   add-subtract units such as the single path fused add-subtract unit
   with/without enhanced aligning and compound adder-round unit and the
   high-speed dual-path fused add-subtract unit. The high-speed dual-path
   fused add-subtract unit has less latency than the single-path fused
   add-subtract units, but with higher power consumption. To reduce the
   power consumption, a dual-path fused add-subtract unit with a simplified
   far/close path scheme is proposed; the significand addition, subtraction
   and round units are not included in the far/close paths while each path
   of the high-speed version has these units. The significand adder and
   subtractor are shared by far/close path. The power consumption of the
   proposed design is 18\% lower than the high-speed dual-path fused
   add-subtract unit at a 16\% cost in latency; however, the proposed
   dual-path fused add-subtract unit is 11-20\% faster than the two
   single-path fused add-subtract units.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on improving the performance of non-restoring
   division by reducing the delay and finding a correct quotient quickly.
   Although the non-restoring division algorithm is the fastest and has
   less complexity than other radix-2 digit recurrent division algorithms,
   there are still some possibilities to enhance its performance. To
   improve its performance, two new approaches are proposed here. For the
   first proposed approach, a non-restoring divider with a modified
   algorithm is presented. The new algorithm changes the order of the
   flowchart, which reduces one unit delay of the multiplexer per
   iteration. Secondly, a new method to find a correct quotient is
   presented and it removes an error that the quotient is always odd number
   after a digit conversion from a digit converter from the quotient with
   digits 1 and -1 to a conventional binary number. The new logic to
   generate the LSB of the quotient quickly is also explained in this
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{Subjective studies have been conducted in the past to obtain human
   judgments of visual quality on distorted images in order, among other
   things, to benchmark objective image quality assessment (IQA)

   ratings on images that were corrupted by only one of many possible
   distortions. However, the majority of images that are available for
   consumption are corrupted by multiple distortions. Towards broadening
   the corpora of records of human responses to visual distortions, we
   recently conducted a study on two types of multiply distorted images to
   obtain human judgments of the visual quality of such images. Further, we
   compared the performance of several existing objective image quality
   measures on the new database and analyze the effects of multiple
   distortions on commonly used quality-determinant features and on human

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an algorithm to enable a secondary user in a
   cognitive radio network to be aware of whether each primary transmitter
   is active or passive, namely network state estimation. The number of
   transmitters is unknown apriori. A secondary user needs to perform a
   multiple-hypothesis testing, which can be achieved via clustering the
   received observations such that observations sharing the same cluster
   are declared to have been generated from the same hypothesis. However,
   most of the clustering algorithms assume that data is available offline
   as a batch. We have earlier proposed the LOC algorithm, a Large-scale
   Online hierarchical Clustering algorithm for unsupervised sequential
   numerical data. Unlike most of clustering algorithms, hierarchical
   algorithms do not assume the number of clusters to be known apriori. In
   this paper, the LOC algorithm is applied in the context of
   multiple-hypothesis testing to enable each secondary user to track the
   network state. The received samples at a secondary user are fed to a
   proposed filter then to the LOC algorithm to obtain a hierarchical tree.
   We study the choice of an adequate cutting level and evaluate the
   spectrum sensing performance. We report a 93\% average probability of
   correctly declaring a true hypothesis in a scenario where number of true
   hypotheses in the network is five.}},

Abstract = {{This study is an experimental determination of the energy return on
   investment (EROI) for algal biocrude production at a research facility
   at the University of Texas at Austin (UT). During the period of this
   assessment, algae were grown at several cultivation scales and processed
   using centrifugation for harvesting, electromechanical cell lysing, and
   lipid separation in an enhanced coalescence membrane. The separated
   algal lipids represent a biocrude product that could be refined into
   fuel. To determine the EROI, a second order analysis was conducted,
   which includes direct and indirect energy flows, but does not consider
   capital energy expenses. At the time that the data in this study was
   collected, the research program was focused on improving biomass and
   lipid productivity. As a result, some higher efficiency processing steps
   were replaced by lower efficiency ones to permit other experiments.
   Although the production process evaluated here was energy negative, the
   majority of the energy consumption resulted from non-optimized growth
   conditions. Therefore, the experimental results do not represent an
   expected typical case EROI for algal fuels, but rather outline the
   important parameters to consider in such an analysis. The results are
   the first known experimental energy balance for an integrated algal
   biocrude production facility.
   A Reduced Case is presented that speculates the energy use for a similar
   system in commercial-scale production. In addition, an analytical model
   that is populated with data that have been reported in the literature is
   presented. For the experiments, the Reduced Case, and Literature Model,
   the estimated EROI was 1.3 x 10(-3), 0.13, and 0.57, respectively
   (refining energy requirements are not included in the experimental or
   Reduced Case EROI value). These results were dominated by growth inputs
   (96.59\%, 94.15\%, and 76.32\% of the total energy requirement,
   respectively). For the experiments and Literature Model, lipid
   separation was the most energy intensive processing step (2.47\% and
   10.06\%, respectively), followed by harvesting, refining, and then
   electromechanical cell lysing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the theological properties of algae slurries as a
   function of cell concentration. From both energy and economic
   perspectives, the algae slurry for producing biofuels should have
   theological attributes that minimizes the pumping power requirements
   while delivering the maximum amount of biomass from the cultivation
   fields to the biorefinery. To achieve this, an accurate knowledge of the
   theological properties of algae slurries as a function of cell
   concentration is necessary. This study measures the theological
   properties of eight different concentrations of Nannochloris sp. in
   ASP-m nutrient media ranging from 0.5 to 80 kg dry biomass/m(3). Strain
   controlled dynamic frequency sweep tests, transient step rate tests, and
   steady rate sweep tests were performed with an ARES-TA Rheometer using a
   double wall couette cup and bob attachment. Shear rates ranged from 5 -
   270 s(-1). The results show that the concentrations of 10 kg/m(3) and
   below behaved as Newtonian fluids with a dynamic viscosity of 1.1x10(-3)
   Pa-s while the concentrations of 20 kg/m(3) and above behaved as shear
   thinning non-Newtonian fluids. Finally, an energy analysis was performed
   where a non-dimensional bioenergy transport efficiency was defined as
   the ratio of the energy content of transported algae biomass to the
   required pumping power. The results show that an optimal biomass
   concentration minimizing pumping requirements occurs at the highest dry
   biomass concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Recent increases in fuel prices have spurred interest in energy
   efficiency and alternative energy technologies. These interests are
   especially relevant for the marine industry, which is responsible for
   transporting over 90\% of the world's freight. The present global fleet
   of commercial ships consumes approximately 200 million tonnes of diesel
   fuel each year - which is expected to rise to around 350 million tonnes
   a year by 2020 {[}5]. Studies have been conducted evaluating
   technologies to increase seagoing propulsion efficiency as well as
   harness available alternative energy sources. One renewable source,
   wind, is particularly interesting since 1) it presents a vast source of
   free energy that has been used throughout much of the history of marine
   transportation, and 2) novel technologies are available that might make
   it attractive for modern ships. The purpose of this analysis is to
   specifically evaluate and compare the ability of two modern wind-based
   technologies to produce thrust-reducing propulsion power for use in
   reducing the fuel consumption of a ship, namely a rigid wing sail and
   Flettner rotor. The analysis focuses on design specifications for each
   based on existing literature and compares the performance of the two
   technologies within a specified, but naturally varying wind environment.
   The force-producing capabilities of each technology are compared as a
   function of the ship operational parameters of heading and speed.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{1-13}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a two-stage equilibrium travel demand model. The
   unique feature of this model is that it takes time-of-day traffic counts
   instead of land use and demographic data as inputs to derive spatial and
   temporal travel demand patterns. The first stage of the model is a trip
   matrix estimator based on traffic count; the second stage is an
   elastic-demand network flow estimator, which recognizes latent demand
   shifts while performing mode split, time-of-day split, and traffic
   assignment in a multilevel equilibration. The main purpose of this paper
   is to describe model development, algorithm design, and software
   implementation experiences. An example application illustrates how the
   model is used to evaluate multiclass, multimode, and multiperiod network
   flow patterns for sketch planning purposes.}},

   Application of a Heteroscedastic Ordered Probit Model}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2280}},
Pages = {{89-99}},
Abstract = {{This study used a heteroscedastic ordered probit model to distinguish
   the effects of vehicle weight, footprint, and height on the severity of
   injuries sustained by vehicle occupants while controlling for many
   occupant, roadway, and other characteristics. Model results suggest that
   the impact of physical vehicle attributes on crash outcomes depends on
   the number of vehicles involved and is typically more significant in
   one-car crashes than in two-car crashes. Although vehicles with larger
   footprints and shorter vehicles were estimated to reduce the risk of
   serious injury for their occupants in single-vehicle crashes, they
   appeared to be less crashworthy in two-vehicle collisions. Heavier
   vehicles were anticipated to be more crashworthy regardless of crash
   type. Under evolving U.S. fuel economy standards, moderate changes in
   the weights, footprints, and heights of light-duty vehicles are
   estimated to have a relatively small impact on crash severities, whereas
   other factors, such as seat belt use, driver intoxication, and the
   presence of roadway curvature and grade, are estimated to influence
   crash outcomes much more noticeably.}},

Abstract = {{Sudden variations in current (large di/dt) can lead to significant power
   supply voltage droops and timing errors in modern microprocessors.
   Several papers discuss the complexity involved with developing test
   programs, also known as stressmarks, to stress the system. Authors of
   these papers produced tools and methodologies to generate stressmarks
   automatically using techniques such as integer linear programming or
   genetic algorithms. However, nearly all of the previous work took place
   in the context of single-core systems, and results were collected and
   analyzed using cycle-level simulators.
   In this paper, we measure and analyze di/dt issues on state-of-the-art
   multi-core x86 systems using real hardware rather than simulators. We
   build on an existing single-core stressmark generation tool to develop
   an AUtomated DI/dT stressmark generation framework, referred to as
   AUDIT, to generate di/dt stressmarks quickly and effectively for
   multi-core systems. We showcase AUDIT's capabilities to adjust to
   microarchitectural and architectural changes. We also present a
   dithering algorithm to address thread alignment issues on multi-core
   processors. We compare standard benchmarks, existing di/dt stressmarks,
   and AUDIT-generated stressmarks executing on multi-threaded, multi-core
   systems with complex out-of-order pipelines. Finally, we show how stress
   analysis using simulators may lead to flawed insights about di/dt
   issues.}},

Abstract = {{The filamentary growth and switching mechanism of SiOx-based resistive
   switching random access memories have been investigated. In test
   structures with two devices connected in series, it has been found that
   the applied voltage in the first electroforming sweep equally stressed
   the SiOx in both devices. Therefore, it is concluded that a conducting
   filament (CF) grows in both devices. The resistance switching is induced
   by the rupture and recovery in a weak spot of the CF. The weak spot
   formation is a random process in the CF and could be anywhere along the
   CF. Once the weak spot is established, the rupture and recovery is
   localized in that particular region and independent of applied voltage
   polarity. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electric faucet concept was realized and demonstrated by embedding
   cobalt nanocrystals in a TiN/SiO2/FeOx/FePt structure. The thermal
   annealing induced cobalt nanocrystals in silicon oxide would shrink both
   the operation voltage and variation as well as improves the electric
   faucet stability. The thickness effect and area size effect would be
   discussed, which indicated the optimized design and possible resistive
   switching mechanism for the FeOx-based memristor. The improvement of
   resistive switching stabilities and switching power characteristics show
   that the embedded nanocrystals in the insulating layer would localize
   the electric faucet formation and rupture at interface region.
   Importantly, a proposed mathematical model to describe the compliance
   current effect shows that the electric faucet was grown in two
   dimensions. These electrical results not only provide a possible
   physical picture to image the dynamic characteristics of the electric
   faucet's growth, but also introduce a possible mathematical method to

Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that, besides traditional sociodemographic and
   built environment attributes, the attitudes and perceptions of parents
   toward walking and bicycling play a crucial role in deciding which
   travel modes children take to school. However, little is known about the
   factors that shape these parental attitudes. The current study aims to
   investigate this unexplored avenue of research and to identify the
   influences on parental attitudes toward children walking and bicycling
   to school as part of a larger nationwide effort to make children more
   physically active and combat rising trends of childhood obesity in the
   United States. Through the use of a multivariate ordered response model
   (a model structure that allows different attitudes to be correlated),
   the current study analyzes five parental attitudes toward children
   walking and bicycling to school on the basis of data drawn from the
   California add-on sample of the 2009 National Household Travel Survey.
   In particular, the subsample from the Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange
   County area is used in this study to take advantage of a rich set of
   microaccessibility measures that are available for this region. It is
   found that school accessibility, work patterns, current mode use in the
   household, and sociodemographic characteristics shape parental attitudes
   toward children walking and bicycling to school. The study findings
   provide insights on policies, strategies, and campaigns that may help
   shift parental attitudes to be more favorable toward children walking
   and bicycling to school.}},

Abstract = {{In order to analyze the stability of a 3D rock block using a limiting

   neglecting the effects of deformability of the rock block, fractures,

   mobilization of shear strength of fractures, and changes in in situ
   stresses with block displacement. These limitations may cause some
   errors when calculating the factor of safety of the block. This paper
   quantifies the error caused by these simplifications comparing the
   results against those obtained with a numerical method (BS3D). In
   addition, the effects of the normal stiffness of the fractures,
   dilatancy, the tunnel radius, and the block size on stability of the

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of energy storage systems on the
   availability of microgrids with different architectures in the presence
   of renewable energy sources (RESs). When RESs are used for power
   generation within a microgrid, its availability may be reduced due to
   the intermittent nature of RESs. Thus, energy storage systems may be
   used as a solution to improve microgrids availability. Therefore, it is
   important to have a realistic evaluation of microgrids availability and
   to determine how added energy storage affects microgrids. Since energy
   storage system is not just a one-time-use reserve, charging and
   discharging processes in energy storage need to be considered when their
   availability is evaluated. Thus, a Markov chain model is used in this
   paper to properly represent the charging and discharging processes of
   energy storage systems, and minimal cut sets method is used in order to
   evaluate the availability of different microgrid architectures. Using
   the proposed method, availabilities of radial, ring, and ladder type
   microgrid architectures are evaluated in the presence of RESs and energy
   storage systems, and results are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Persons with poststroke hemiparesis are characterized by asymmetry in

   walking. The purpose of this study was to determine the asymmetry in
   magnitude and duration of LL and LU in individuals with hemiparesis and
   its relationship with functional walking status and specific kinematic
   and kinetic variables during walking. Forty-four participants with
   chronic hemiparesis walked at their self-selected speeds and eighteen
   nondisabled control subjects of similar ages walked at predetermined
   matched speeds while three-dimensional ground reaction forces and
   body-segment kinematics were recorded. Magnitude of paretic LL was
   reduced, while duration was increased compared with the nonparetic leg
   and nondisabled controls walking at matched speeds. The paretic LL and
   LU was significantly correlated with average leg angle, while the
   nonparetic leg significantly correlated with average knee angle. Three
   different patterns of LL and LU were identified (concave, convex, and
   linear). Individuals with hemiparesis make several biomechanical
   adjustments that minimize LL of the paretic leg. LL deviations were more
   pronounced with increased lateral placement of the paretic foot and with
   decreased functional gait speed. Characterization of these deviations
   may inspire new strategies for rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-frequency space-based GPS receivers have many mission-enabling
   capabilities as compared to their single-frequency counterparts. The
   ionosphere-corrected range measurement allows precise orbit
   determination (POD) of the spacecraft to centimeter level, which has
   been successfully demonstrated in several space missions that have
   studied the Earth. Furthermore, the dual-frequency measurement allows
   observation of the ionospheric delay, which supports GPS radio
   occultation and space weather experiments. With the emergence of a
   second civilian GPS signal, dual-frequency measurements may be used for
   future real-time space applications such as autonomous formation flying,
   satellite networks, and cooperative control (e. g., satellite inspection
   and rendezvous).
   While dual-frequency GPS receivers have been used in space for more than
   two decades, the size, power, and cost of this technology is an
   important driver for future space missions. The growing availability of
   launch opportunities for very small satellites known as nanosatellites
   and CubeSats raises the possibility of more affordable access to space
   measurements if the observation quality is sufficient to support the
   user's needs.
   This paper presents the initial development and testing of the Fast,
   Orbital, TEC, Observables, and Navigation (FOTON) receiver: a small,
   reconfigurable, dual-frequency, space-based GPS receiver. Originally
   developed as a science-grade software receiver for monitoring
   ionospheric scintillation and total electron content (TEC), this
   receiver was designed to provide high-quality GPS signal observations.
   The original receiver hardware was miniaturized and the software has
   been adapted for low earth orbit (LEO) operations. FOTON now fits within
   a 0.5U CubeSat form factor (8.3 x 9.6 x 3.8 cm), weighs 400 g, and
   consumes 4.5 W of instantaneous power, which can be reduced to 1 W orbit
   average power with on-off duty cycling. The receiver has been designed
   with commercial parts to keep manufacturing costs low.
   Significant testing of FOTON has been performed with live signals and
   with signals generated by a Spirent GPS signal simulator. Initial
   terrestrial tests demonstrate behavioral consistency with the original
   heritage high performance receiver. Several LEO simulations are
   presented, demonstrating FOTON's single-and dual-frequency positioning,
   Kalman filter based POD, and GPS radio occultation observation
   capabilities. In addition, its acquisition and reacquisition performance
   is presented; on average, FOTON's time to first fix is approximately 45
   seconds. Finally, an orbital Kalman filter is introduced to enable
   navigation in geostationary orbit (GEO), which is a challenging

Abstract = {{Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is a new intersection control
   protocol that exploits the capabilities of autonomous vehicles to
   control traffic at intersections in a way better than traffic signals
   and stop signs. A key assumption of this protocol is that vehicles can
   always follow their trajectories. But mechanical failures can occur in
   real life, causing vehicles to deviate from their trajectories. A
   previous approach for handling mechanical failure was to prevent
   vehicles from entering the intersection after the failure. However, this
   approach cannot prevent collisions among vehicles already in the
   intersection or too close to stop because (1) the lack of coordination
   among vehicles can cause collisions during the execution of evasive
   actions; and (2) the intersection may not have enough room for evasive
   actions. In this paper, we propose a preemptive approach that
   pre-computes evasion plans for several common types of mechanical
   failures before vehicles enter an intersection. This preemptive approach
   is necessary because there are situations in which vehicles cannot evade
   without pre-allocation of space for evasion. We present a modified AIM
   protocol and demonstrate the effectiveness of evasion plan execution on
   a miniature autonomous intersection testbed.}},

Abstract = {{We present a parallel multigrid method for solving variable-coefficient
   elliptic partial differential equations on arbitrary geometries using
   highly adapted meshes. Our method is designed for meshes that are built
   from an unstructured hexahedral macro mesh, in which each macro element
   is adaptively refined as an octree. This forest-of-octrees approach
   enables us to generate meshes for complex geometries with arbitrary
   levels of local refinement. We use geometric multigrid (GMG) for each of
   the octrees and algebraic multigrid (AMG) as the coarse grid solver. We
   designed our GMG sweeps to entirely avoid collectives, thus minimizing
   communication cost.
   We present weak and strong scaling results for the 3D
   variable-coefficient Poisson problem that demonstrate high parallel
   scalability. As a highlight, the largest problem we solve is on a
   non-uniform mesh with 100 billion unknowns on 262,144 cores of NCCS's
   Cray XK6 ``Jaguar{''}; in this solve we sustain 272 TFlops/s.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, following the results exposed at the Seventh
   International Conference of Computational Methods in Sciences and
   Engineering (ICCMSE 09), we present an overview of some available new
   techniques able to unravel interactions in large complex systems such as
   biomolecules, ions in solution, lanthanides and actinides complexes. We
   first focus our attention on Quantum Chemistry (QC) interpretative
   techniques introducing some Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) scheme
   such as the newly introduced fragment localized Single-CI DFT scheme. We
   then present the recently developed DEMEP analysis which is an extension
   of the topological analysis of the Electron Localization Function (ELF)
   to the computations of chemically intuitive local electrostatic moments.
   In a second part, we then discuss how such QC techniques can be used,
   following a ``bottom-up{''} strategy in order to develop new generation
   polarizable force field based on distributed multipoles such as the
   AMOEBA and SIBFA (Sum of Interaction Between Fragments ab initio)
   procedure; or on electronic density as for the GEM (Gaussian
   electrostatic Model) method which is based on density fitting. Some
   applications are detailed.}},

Abstract = {{Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) are a Smart Grid technology which
   can enhance real-time situational awareness for power sytem operators.
   WAMS are created from a network of synchronized measurement devices
   taking voltage and current measurements from the power system. This
   network is also known as a synchrophasor network. A synchrophasor
   network was created at the University of Texas at Austin to obtain real
   power system measurements for power system analysis. The network is
   continuously operating and recording voltage phasor data (voltage
   magnitude, angle, and frequency) at a rate of 30 data points per second.
   Because of the high volume of PMU data generated it is difficult to
   detect and analyze power system events of interest. To help power system
   operators more easily monitor the power system and easily detect events
   in PMU data, two different types of methods were created to
   automatically screen the data for events. The first method screens a
   small window of PMU voltage data and detects events based on a variety
   of techniques. The second method is an off-line method that detects
   events based on the magnitude of low frequency oscillations in PMU
   voltage data.}},

   nanopatterning through the 193nm lithography is being pushed to its
   limit, through double/triple or more general multiple patterning, while
   non-conventional lithography technologies such as extreme ultra-violet
   (EUV), e-beam direct-write (EBDW), and so on, still have grand
   challenges to be solved for their adoption into IC volume production.
   This tutorial will provide an overview of key overarching issues in
   nanometer IC design for manufacturability (DFM) with these emerging
   lithography technologies, from modeling, mask synthesis, to physical

Abstract = {{Electromigration (EM) has become a key reliability concern for nanometer
   IC designs. For 3D ICs, higher current density/temperature and
   TSV-induced thermal mechanical stress further exacerbate the EM issue
   compared to 2D ICs. In this paper, we analyze the root causes of EM for
   3D IC signal nets, with consideration of current density, temperature,
   and TSV-induced thermal mechanical stress. We develop compact EM models
   for both DC and AC signal nets using detailed finite-element-analysis
   (FEA) and build EM library for mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). For AC
   signal nets, we convert AC current into equivalent DC current and model
   EM with it. One unique property of EM in 3D ICs is that, depending on
   the current direction, TSV-induced stress may degrade or improve the
   MTTF, thus routing plays an important role for EM mitigation. We suggest
   EM-aware routing algorithms for 3D ICs for the first time to our best
   knowledge, guided by our stress-aware EM modeling. Experimental result
   shows that our proposed approach improves EM-robustness of 3D IC
   benchmarks significantly, e. g., 66.4\% less EM-violated grids with
   little sacrifice of conventional routing objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in approximate computation is driven by its potential to
   achieve large energy savings. This paper formally demonstrates an
   optimal way to reduce energy via voltage over-scaling at the cost of
   errors due to timing starvation in addition. We identify a fundamental
   trade-off between error frequency and error magnitude in a
   timing-starved adder. We introduce a formal model to prove that for
   signal processing applications using a quadratic signal-to-noise ratio
   error measure, reducing bit-wise error frequency is sub-optimal.
   Instead, energy-optimal approximate addition requires limiting maximum
   error magnitude. Intriguingly, due to possible error patterns, this is
   achieved by reducing carry chains significantly below what is allowed by
   the timing budget for a large fraction of sum bits, using an aligned,
   fixed internal-carry structure for higher significance bits.
   We further demonstrate that remaining approximation error is reduced by
   realization of conditional bounding (CB) logic for lower significance
   bits. A key contribution is the formalization of an approximate CB logic
   synthesis problem that produces a rich space of Pareto-optimal adders
   with a range of quality-energy tradeoffs. We show how CB logic can be
   customized to result in over-and under-estimating approximate adders,
   and how a dithering adder that mixes them produces zero-centered error
   distributions, and, in accumulation, a reduced-variance error. We
   demonstrate synthesized approximate adders with energy up to 60\%
   smaller than that of a conventional timing-starved adder, where a 30\%
   reduction is due to the superior synthesis of inexact CB logic. When
   used in a larger system implementing an image-processing algorithm,
   energy savings of 40\% are possible.}},

   formation. This work describes the modulus enhancement of thermoplastic

   using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Different compositions of TPU
   nanocomposites were prepared on a commercial scale twin-screw extruder
   using a montmorillonite organo-clay, carbon nanofibers and multiwall
   carbon nanotubes (MWNT). The onset of softening was found to increase
   with nanoparticle loading (tested at 1 Hz). Overall MWNT were found to
   produce the optimal reinforcement response in the char for TPU-based
   nanocomposites heated to 300 degrees C. A gap in reinforcement was noted
   at certain temperatures as the samples developed char. A correlation can
   be drawn between crossover of dissipative versus elastic behavior

Abstract = {{FALCON (FAst fauLt COverage estimatioN) is a scalable method for fault
   grading which uses local fault simulations to estimate the fault
   coverage of a large system. The generality of this method makes it
   applicable for any modular design. Our analysis shows that the run time
   of our algorithm is related to the number of gates and the number of IOs
   in a module, while fault simulation run time is related to the total
   number of gates in the system. We have measured fault coverage for
   OR1200 and IVM processors and compared the results with fault simulation
   performed by a commercial tool. We have also compared our results with
   fault sampling. Our results show that for large designs FALCON is an
   order of magnitude faster compared with fault simulation. It also has a
   smaller error rate compared with fault sampling when the size of design

Abstract = {{hSequential linear decompressors are inherently efficient and attractive
   for compressing test cubes with many don't cares. The test cubes are
   encoded by solving a system of linear equations. In continuous
   decompression, typically a fixed number of free variables are used to
   encode each test cube in a ``one-size-fits-all{''} manner. The non-pivot
   free variables used in Gaussian elimination are wasted when the
   decompressor is reset before decompressing the next test cube. This
   paper explores techniques for retaining the non-pivot free variables for
   a test cube and using them to help encode subsequent test cubes and
   hence improve encoding efficiency. This approach retains most of the
   non-pivot free variables with only a minimal increase in runtime for
   solving the equations and no added control information. Experimental
   results are presented showing that the encoding efficiency, and hence
   compression, can be significantly boosted.}},

Title = {{Open, closed, and shared access femtocells in the downlink}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{A fundamental choice in femtocell deployments is the set of users which
   are allowed to access each femtocell. Closed access restricts the set to
   specifically registered users, while open access allows any mobile
   subscriber to use any femtocell. Which one is preferable depends
   strongly on the distance between the macrocell base station (MBS) and
   femtocell. The main results of the this article are lemmas which provide
   expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-to-noise ratio (SINR)
   distribution for various zones within a cell as a function of this
   MBS-femto distance. The average sum throughput (or any other SINR-based
   metric) of home users and cellular users under open and closed access
   can readily be determined from these expressions. We show that unlike in
   the uplink, the interests of home and cellular users are in conflict,
   with home users preferring closed access and cellular users preferring
   open access. The conflict is most pronounced for femtocells near the
   cell edge, when there are many cellular users and fewer femtocells. To
   mitigate this conflict, we propose a middle way which we term shared
   access in which femtocells allocate an adjustable number of time-slots
   between home and cellular users such that a specified minimum rate for
   each can be achieved. The optimal such sharing fraction is derived.
   Analysis shows that shared access achieves at least the overall
   throughput of open access while also satisfying rate requirements, while
   closed access fails for cellular users and open access fails for the
   home user.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2304}},
Pages = {{112-118}},
Abstract = {{This study focuses on large-scale pavement maintenance and
   rehabilitation planning. Pavement agencies usually deal with large and
   diverse networks of thousands of pavement sections. The complexity of
   pavement maintenance and rehabilitation planning increases exponentially
   with the size of the network. Exact optimization methods designed for
   small-scale problems thus suffer from dimensionality, which
   significantly compromises the ability to solve such problems in a
   reasonable time period. Consequently, such problems should be approached
   from the technique of approximation. A method with the Lagrangian
   relaxation technique and a branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed for use
   as a decomposition scheme for pavement maintenance and rehabilitation
   planning problems when the size of the problem poses a major hurdle for
   its solution. The proposed approach first decomposes the network
   (original problem) into individual sections (subproblems) and then
   solves the subproblems separately. As shown in the case study, the
   proposed approach is able to solve problems with a practical size
   efficiently. More specifically, the results show that the proposed
   method can solve problems with a network of 1,000 sections within a
   reasonable time period and can yield a solution close to the optimal
   one.}},

Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The growing availability of large scale functional networks has promoted
   the development of many successful techniques for predicting functions
   of genes. Here we extend these network-based principles and techniques
   to functionally characterize whole sets of genes. We present RIDDLE
   (Reflective Diffusion and Local Extension), which uses well developed
   guilt-by-association principles upon a human gene network to identify
   associations of gene sets. RIDDLE is particularly adept at
   characterizing sets with no annotations, a major challenge where most
   traditional set analyses fail. Notably, RIDDLE found microRNA-450a to be
   strongly implicated in ocular diseases and development. A web
   application is available at www.functionalnet.org/RIDDLE.}},

Abstract = {{This work uses a unique database of nearly 5000 single-family home
   energy audits performed between 2009 and 2010 in Austin, TX to I)
   characterize the homes and their air-conditioning systems, and 2)
   estimate the aggregated peak power savings attainable through the
   implementation of a series of conservation steps. The audit database is
   restricted to single-family detached units, which allows the analysis to
   be extrapolated to just under one-half of the Austin residential
   building stock. Characterization of the audit homes reveals that many
   homes still have ``low-hanging fruit{''} efficiency improvements
   available. Theoretically enrolling all homes in the utility-sponsored
   efficiency program yields a potential reduction in the average
   air-conditioner size in the database from 3.1 tons (11 kW) to 2.2 tons
   (7.7 kW), which corresponds to a peak power demand reduction of 1.8 kW
   for the average individual system. The maximum utility-scale peak power
   reduction for the implementation of this program city-wide is estimated
   to be as high as 290 mic, which is almost 8\% of Austin's peak electric
   demand in 2008 and enough to possibly offset new power plant
   acquisitions. Our calculations estimate that >97\% of homes in the audit
   database would benefit from enrollment in a home efficiency program and
   that the cost of savings is significantly less than the cost of new
   generation facilities. Although this analysis is based on data from the
   City of Austin, understanding the methods described herein could allow
   electric utilities and homeowners in similar climates to make
   better-informed decisions when considering efficiency improvement
   programs.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{28-37}},
Abstract = {{Residential location choice is a key determinant of activity-travel
   behavior, yet little is known about the reasons why people choose to
   move or not move residences. Such understanding is critical to being
   able to model residential location choices over time and design built
   environments that people find appealing. This paper attempts to fill
   this gap by developing a joint model of the choice to move residence and
   the primary reason behind the move. The model is estimated on the
   Florida subsample of the 2009 U.S. National Household Tavel Survey.
   Model results shed considerable light on the socioeconomic and
   demographic variables that affect a household's decision whether to move
   residence and the primary reason underlying that decision.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to examine the performance of the
   Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission trip-based and tour-based
   frameworks in the context of three specific projects started and
   completed within the past 20 years in the Columbus, Ohio, metropolitan
   area. Region- and project-level comparisons of the performance of the
   trip- and tour-based models were made for three scenario years: 1990,
   2000, and 2005. The region-level analysis was undertaken in the context
   of four travel dimensions on the basis of data availability and observed
   data to model output compatibility. These four dimensions were vehicle
   ownership, work flow distribution, work flow distribution by time of
   day, and average work trip travel time. The tour-based model performed
   better overall than the trip-based model for all four dimensions. The
   project-level comparative assessment of the predicted link volumes from
   the trip-based and the tour-based models was undertaken according to the
   observed link counts and roadway functional class. The results did not
   show any clear trends according to the performance of the models by
   functional class or year.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from the application of a comprehensive
   socioeconomic and demographic model system in conjunction with a
   continuous-time, activity-based microsimulation model of travel demand
   developed for the Southern California Association of Governments. The
   socioeconomic model system includes two major components. The first is a
   synthetic population generator that is capable of synthesizing a
   representative population for the entire region while controlling for
   both household- and person-level marginal distributions. The second is
   an econometric microsimulator that models various socioeconomic and
   demographic attributes for each person in the synthetic population with
   a view to developing a rich set of input data for the activity-based
   microsimulation model system. The results show that the socioeconomic
   model system is capable of replicating known distributions of
   demographic attributes in the population and can be easily scaled for
   implementation in large regions such as the Southern California area,
   which includes a population of more than 18 million people in its model

Title = {{Method to Quantify Healing in Asphalt Composites by Continuum Damage
   Approach}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2296}},
Pages = {{86-96}},
Abstract = {{The importance of healing and its impact on the fatigue cracking
   performance of asphalt mixtures are well recognized. Microdamage healing
   in an asphalt mixture is a function of several factors, such as the
   physical and chemical properties of the binder, the properties of the
   mixture, the level of damage before the rest period during which healing
   occurs, the duration of the rest period, temperature, and pressure. An
   experimental and analytical method characterizes the healing in an
   asphalt composite (fine aggregate matrix) as a function of the level of
   damage before the rest period and the duration of the rest period. The
   proposed method builds on the viscoelastic continuum damage theory that
   has been used successfully by other researchers to characterize fatigue
   cracking in asphalt mixtures. The method is applied to evaluate the
   healing characteristics of four fine aggregate matrix mixes and is able
   to quantify the influence of the duration of the rest period and the
   level of damage preceding the rest period on overall healing. Two
   verification tests were used to demonstrate that the amount of healing
   measured by the proposed method was independent of the sequence of
   loading or rest periods. Results from the initial tests support the
   hypothesis that the healing characteristics determined with the proposed
   test method at isothermal conditions can be treated as a characteristic
   material property.}},

Abstract = {{Developing cyber-physical systems (CPS) is challenging because
   correctness depends on both logical and physical states, which are
   collectively difficult to observe. The developer often need to
   repeatedly rerun the system while observing its behavior and tweak the
   hardware and software until it meets minimum requirements. This process
   is tedious, error-prone, and lacks rigor. To address this, we propose
   BRACE, a framework that simplifies the process by enabling developers to
   correlate cyber (i.e., logical) and physical properties of the system
   via assertions. This paper presents our initial investigation into the
   requirements and semantics of such assertions, which we call CPS
   assertions. We discusses our experience implementing and using the
   framework with a mobile robot, and highlight key future research
   challenges.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present an optimization model
   formulation based on deterministic dynamic programming (DDP) and to
   propose both the Bellman and Wagner approaches to solve the problem of
   equipment replacement optimization (ERO). The developed solution
   methodology is general and can be used to make optimal keep and replace
   decisions for new and used vehicles, with and without annual budget
   considerations. A simple numerical example illustrates and steps through
   the Bellman DDP solution process and demonstrates how DDP is used to
   solve the ERO problem through backward recursion. The developed
   DDP-based ERO software is tested and validated with Texas Department of
   Transportation vehicle fleet data. Comprehensive numerical results, such
   as the software computational time and solution quality, are described.
   Substantial cost savings are estimated with this ERO software. Further
   research directions are suggested.}},

Title = {{Reducing Turbidity of Construction Site Runoff Coagulation with
   Polyacrylamide}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{171-177}},
Abstract = {{The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is developing a nationwide
   standard for turbidity in construction site runoff. It is widely
   expected that conventional measures for erosion and sediment control
   cannot meet this standard; consequently, innovative practices for
   managing sediment on construction sites must be developed. One emerging
   practice is the use of polyacrylamide (PAM) to improve sediment control
   by promoting flocculation of particles in runoff. Effective use of this
   practice requires an understanding of how the properties of soil and PAM
   affect flocculation. The objective of this study was to develop such an
   understanding. A protocol for creating modified synthetic stormwater
   runoff from soil samples was developed, and synthetic runoff suspensions
   were created with soil from six Texas construction sites. Particle size
   distribution was used to compare the synthetic runoff suspensions with
   grab samples of stormwater from one site. Flocculation tests were
   performed on the synthetic runoff suspensions with PAM doses ranging
   from 0.03 to 10 mg/L. The polymers used included anionic PAMs of 0\% to
   50\% charge density and 0.2 to 14 Mg/mol molecular weight and one
   copolymer. A neutral PAM and the copolymer were the most effective in
   reducing the turbidity of all the synthetic runoff suspensions below 200
   nephelometric turbidity units at doses of 10 mg/L. Hardness tests
   indicated interparticle bridging to be the bonding mechanism. The
   high-molecular-weight (HMW) anionic PAMs were effective on only two of
   the six synthetic runoff suspensions. As the charge density of these HMW
   PAMs increased, their effectiveness decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Retrospective correction of intensity inhomogeneities in magnetic
   resonance images of the brain is an essential pre-processing step before
   any sophisticated image analysis task can be performed. A popular choice
   when defining the degradation model in MR images is to use
   multiplicative intensity inhomogeneities that slowly varying across the
   image domain; this approach has been extensively used for bias field
   estimation. However, such a multiplicative model is often insufficient
   given that some of the most dominant physical causes of intensity
   inhomogeneities in MRI (such as non-uniform excitation strength) have a
   non-linear relationship with the receptor signal intensity. In this
   study, we consider a linear image degradation model with multiplicative
   and additive intensity inhomogeneity components. We propose a
   variational level sets approach that combines estimation of intensity
   inhomogeneity components during the image segmentation process. The
   evaluation of proposed approach on real MR image datasets demonstrate
   accurate estimation of multiplicative and additive intensity
   inhomogeneities improving brain tissue segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a segmentation algorithm that allows optical properties to be
   extracted from diffuse reflectance hyper-spectral datasets with a
   speedup of three orders of magnitude when compared to current methods.
   Such data could be used for the detection of melanoma. The algorithm
   first performs dimensionality reduction using principal component
   analysis, and then the image is segmented using k-means clustering. The
   mean spectrum from each cluster is then calculated and can be used to
   extract chemical information. By reducing the number of spectra to be
   analyzed, extraction of physiological information can be achieved three
   orders of magnitude faster than methods requiring the analysis of every
   spectrum in the hyperspectral dataset. The effect of noise on the
   ability of the algorithm to accurately segment images was tested using
   digital phantoms, for which the noise level was under the control of the
   investigators. The analysis showed a linear relationship between the
   level of noise and the smallest difference in scattering that the
   algorithm was able to accurately detect and segment. This finding can be
   used to determine the maximum amount of noise in the imaging system that
   will still allow detection of the difference in optical properties
   between non-melanoma and melanoma.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative measures of breast morphology can help a breast cancer
   survivor to understand outcomes of reconstructive surgeries. One
   bottleneck of quantifying breast morphology is that there are only a few
   reliable automation algorithms for detecting the breast contour. This
   study proposes a novel approach for detecting the breast contour, which
   is based on a parametric active contour model. In addition to employing
   the traditional parametric active contour model, the proposed approach
   enforces a mathematical shape constraint based on the catenary curve,
   which has been previously shown to capture the overall shape of the
   breast contour reliably {[}1]. The mathematical shape constraint
   regulates the evolution of the active contour and helps the contour
   evolve towards the breast, while minimizing the undesired effects of
   other structures such as, the nipple/areola and scars. The efficacy of
   the proposed approach was evaluated on anterior posterior photographs of
   women who underwent or were scheduled for breast reconstruction surgery
   including autologous tissue reconstruction. The proposed algorithm shows
   promising results for detecting the breast contour.}},

   strategies have been studied intensively in the literature. The
   performance of secondary devices are limited by the presumed CITD. But
   none of them provides a reasonable characterization of the CITD in

   using large amount of channel idle time data collected in various WLAN

   hyperexponential densities. Based on the estimated density, we propose a
   novel multiple-shot transmission strategy which takes advantage of the
   hyperexponential feature of the CITD. This strategy achieves at least
   twice the increase for the data we examine in average secondary access

Abstract = {{Quality of Experience (QoE) has taken a center stage in the performance
   evaluation of multimedia delivery technologies. The Third Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) system is the
   latest generation of wireless cellular technology expected to deliver
   higher data rates and meet the burgeoning data demand. With the
   projected dominant share of video services in mobile traffic, providing
   satisfactory QoE to video users is a key objective for LTE system
   design. In this paper, we present a QoE-based evaluation methodology to
   assess the LTE system video capacity in terms of the number of unicast
   video consumers that can be simultaneously supported for a given target
   QoE. We define and use the notion of rebuffering outage capacity to
   quantify the video service capacity. Our evaluation further incorporates
   adaptive streaming, a promising technology for video delivery over
   wireless, and presents its consequent QoE-capacity tradeoff. The impact
   of QoE-based outage criteria is also investigated on the downlink video
   capacity. Finally, we propose a QoE-aware radio resource management
   (RRM) framework which allows the network operator to further enhance the
   video capacity. Our results demonstrate that there is a significant
   potential to optimize video capacity through QoE awareness both at the
   application level and radio access network (RAN) level.}},

Pages = {{26-34}},
Abstract = {{Technology for tracking with handoff-based cellular probes is one of the
   most important modern methods of traffic monitoring. Some simulation
   frameworks have been proposed to investigate the key issues in such
   systems. However, most existing simulation approaches rely on
   assumptions of cell boundaries and handoff points; these assumptions may
   lead to inaccurate predictions of the performance of real systems. The
   proposed model incorporated the actual communication mechanism for cell
   phone signals used in real-world cellular networks. In the proposed
   simulation framework, cell boundaries were dynamic, cell sizes varied,
   and the handoff process was controlled by actual protocols for cellular
   communication. An algorithm for handoff pattern matching is also
   presented. The algorithm deals with the dynamic handoff sequence for the
   purposes of traffic detection. The approach was verified with a
   calibrated simulation road network. The impacts of two important
   factors, call duration and probe penetration, were also investigated.
   The results showed that the proposed simulation platform for wireless
   communication could produce more reliable results and gain deeper
   insights into the performance of the handoff-based cellular traffic
   monitoring systems than had been achieved through the traditional
   simulation approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In virtualized systems, several Virtual Machines (VM) running on a
   single hardware platform share and compete for the hardware resources
   such as memory, disk and network IO to meet a certain Quality of Service
   (QoS) requirements. It is critical to characterize and understand how
   the different workloads running in the VMs interact and share such
   resources to be able to map them efficiently onto processor cores and
   server hosts for optimal performance. This is especially important for
   resources such as memory controllers or the on-chip or inter-socket
   networks for which there is currently no software control.
   In this paper, we present a measurement-based performance analysis of
   server virtualization workloads from a real system using virtual
   machines that are part of the popular industry standard VMmark
   benchmark, a server consolidation benchmark. First, we characterize the
   relative resource contention and interference impact of VMs when
   multiple virtual workloads are run together. Second, we study the
   effects of co-locating different types of VMs under various VM to core
   placement schemes and discover the best placement for performance. We
   observe performance variations from 25-65\% for Database servers and
   from 7-40\% for File servers when compared to standalone VM depending on
   the placement of these VMs onto cores and the degree of sharing of
   resources. Finally, we propose an interference metric and regression
   model for the worst set of co-located VMs in our study. Based on
   different VM placement schemes we show that the overall server
   consolidation performance in a virtualized host can be improved by 8\%
   when the VMs are placed effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of the radiative heat transfer is of great
   importance in simulations of combustion processes. To compute the total
   radiative transfer, it is necessary to integrate the radiative transfer
   equation (RTE) over the entire wavelength spectrum, a highly time
   consuming task that still demands the use of gas models. In this work, a
   finite volume code is used to simulate a steady-state methane-air
   diffusion flame. The code solves the equations for the conservation of
   mass, momentum, individual species and energy. The solution also
   includes a chemistry model for the formation of soot, which is of major
   importance in the computation of the radiation heat transfer. The
   radiation exchanges are computed by the discrete ordinates method, and
   using two different approaches: the gray gas model and the spectral-line
   based weighted-sum-of-grays-gases (SLW) model. The results for the
   temperature distribution, gas species concentration, and soot formation
   are examined with the two different radiation gas models used.}},

Abstract = {{Video acquired by handheld CMOS cameras may suffer from rolling shutter
   artifacts. Rolling shutter artifacts, which are due to the rows in the
   image sensor array being exposed sequentially from top to bottom,
   increase with the speed of the relative motion between the scene and
   camera. To rectify these artifacts, one needs to recover the projection
   parameters for each row. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
   method to estimate 3-D camera rotation by using video and inertial
   measurements on the handheld platform, such as a smart phone. Our
   contributions are (1) an efficient sensor fusion algorithm using an
   extended Kalman filter, and (2) a quality assessment method using
   vanishing point detection. Experiments indicate that the proposed sensor
   fusion algorithm produces a more accurate orientation estimate and
   better rectifies rolling shutter artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{An alternating optimization algorithm was recently proposed for the
   K-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel. For
   flat-fading channels and feasible problems, this algorithm successfully
   aligns the interfering signals exploiting the spatial dimensions. In
   this paper, we consider the case in which all pairwise MIMO channels are
   frequency-selective (convolutive), and the users transmit broadband
   signals using a single-carrier scheme. Unlike the flat-fading case, for
   frequency-selective channels it is necessary to add a spectral mask in
   the frequency response of the precoders and decoders to avoid trivial
   solutions. We show in the paper that each step of the alternating
   minimization algorithm can be reformulated as a convex optimization
   problem in which the autocorrelation function of the precoders or
   decoders is obtained. Upon convergence, a final spectral factorization
   stage must be applied to obtain the precoders and decoders from their
   autocorrelation functions. Simulation results are provided to illustrate
   the performance of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We report that unique properties of long-range surface plasmon
   polaritons (LR SPP) allow one to produce optical components with very
   wide tuning range using small variations in the refractive index of the
   dielectric layer. Our filter is based on integration of a thin metal
   film between two dielectrics with dissimilar refractive index
   dispersion. In this configuration, the filter only has low insertion
   loss at a wavelength for which the refractive indices of the top and
   bottom dielectrics are the same, leading to a bandpass filter. As a
   proof-of-principle demonstration, we present operation of LR-SPP-based
   bandpass optical filters with refractive index matching fluids on an
   Au/SiO2 surface in which a 0.004 variation in the refractive index of
   the top dielectric translates into 210nm of bandpass tuning at telecom
   wavelengths. To make a more practical solid-state device, thermo-optic
   polymer can be used as a top dielectric and we expect that only 8
   degrees C of temperature variation translates into 200nm. The tuning
   mechanism proposed here may be used to create monolithic filters with
   tuning range spanning over more than an optical octave, compact and
   widely-tunable laser systems, multi-spectral imagers, and other
   plasmonic components with broadly-tunable optical response.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware based execution monitoring of applications holds the promise
   for an effective and tamper-proof solution for intrusion detection on
   processor. This paper presents a practical hardware based intrusion
   detection framework which uses stream cipher based hashing techniques
   for runtime control flow and instruction integrity monitoring. This
   framework enables accurate monitoring of the control flow of a process
   with an instruction level granularity. Additional hardware required for
   implementation of our framework has very low power and area overheads
   which makes it possible to practically implement execution monitoring
   even on embedded processors. Our technique achieves an order of
   magnitude lower power overhead compared to other similar techniques.
   Furthermore, our implementation of the developed framework has a low
   intrusion detection latency, which enables us to verify the control flow
   integrity of the executing code before the violating control flow
   instructions are retired from the processor pipeline.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing power consumption and increasing efficiency is a key concern
   for many applications. It is well-accepted that specialization and
   heterogeneity are crucial strategies to improve both power and
   performance. Yet, how to design highly efficient processing elements
   while maintaining enough flexibility within a domain of applications is
   a fundamental question. In this paper, we present the design of a
   specialized Linear Algebra Core (LAC) for an important class of
   computational kernels, the level-3 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
   (BLAS). We demonstrate a detailed algorithm/architecture co-design for
   mapping a number of level-3 BLAS operations onto the LAC.
   Results show that our prototype LAC achieves a performance of around 64
   GFLOPS (double precision) for these operations, while consuming less
   than 1.3 Watts in standard 45nm CMOS technology. This is on par with a
   full-custom design and up to 50x and 10x better in terms of power
   efficiency than CPUs and GPUs.}},

Abstract = {{Variability and uncertainty in wind power represent significant risks to
   system operators as well as wind farm owners. The coupling of wind with
   energy storage systems has been used as a means of managing wind power
   variability and intermittency. The purpose of this paper is to provide a
   methodology to estimate the size (power and energy capacities) of an
   energy storage system with the goal of minimizing deviations from the
   hourly average wind power production. Using a probabilistic forecast of
   the hourly average wind power production and the inverse of the joint
   cumulative distribution of the maximum and minimum deviations from the
   hourly average, hour-long wind power production scenarios are generated.
   The statistics of the energy storage system's characteristics are then
   estimated from these scenarios as a function of the desired risk
   parameter. The evaluation of the proposed methodology using real-world
   wind power data reveals that the generated wind power production
   scenarios have distributions which exhibit a small statistical distance
   to the actual ones. Moreover, the estimated energy storage system
   characteristics have coverage rates close to the nominal ones, with an
   average absolute deviation less than 1.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of wind speed variation on
   short-circuit current contribution from a fixed-speed wind turbine. The
   focus is on fixed-speed wind turbines since this type of wind turbines
   can contribute fault currents as high as 6 or more times the rated
   current. The study is motivated by the fact that wind speed variation
   affects the internal voltage of the generator. As a result, if a fault
   occurs when the internal generator voltage is maximum, the fault current
   will be maximum. When the internal voltage is minimum, it will result in
   minimum short-circuit current. Hence, the objective in this paper is to
   study how significant this variation in fault current is with respect to
   the protective device settings calculated from the IEC 60909 Standard.
   Although this Standard has been developed for traditional power systems,
   it is a common practice to use it in networks interconnected with
   distributed generation. Five comprehensive case studies have been
   conducted. For each case study, the maximum and minimum fault current is
   calculated using the IEC Standard 60909 and compared with simulation
   results at different wind speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicle battery charger connected to the secondary distribution
   grid potentially raises power quality (PQ) concerns, thus the necessity
   of the analysis of its impact on the grid. Charger assembly consists of
   power electronic equipments that undergo fast switchings. It makes the
   device-level simulation very slow and impractical for PQ analysis and
   calls for an average model for the system. This paper presents an
   average-value model (AVM) for a single-phase generic battery charger of
   a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The proposed AVM includes a rectifier
   circuit and its filter, boost converter and battery banks. Average
   dynamics of the switching circuit are obtained by averaging the effects
   of fast switchings in the device that occur within a prototypical
   switching interval, resulting in a fast simulation model. Proposed AVM
   is validated against device-level time-domain model for a variable load
   and a battery load and found to be very accurate and robust in
   approximating the switching model and battery charging dynamics. It
   should be noted that a pulse width modulation (PWM) control algorithm
   for conditioning input current waveform is not included in the average
   value model, resulting in a non-sinusoidal supply current waveform rich
   in harmonics. A time-domain model with PWM controller is also developed
   and compared against the developed AVM model.}},

Abstract = {{Wind generating resources have been increasing more rapidly than any
   other renewable generating resources. Wind farm output prediction is an
   important issue for deploying higher wind power penetrations on power
   grids. The existing work on wind farm output prediction has focused on
   the temporal issues. As wind farm outputs depend on natural wind
   resources that vary over space and time, spatial analysis and modeling
   is also needed. Predictions about suitability for locating new wind
   generating resources can be performed by optimal spatial modeling. In
   this paper, a new approach to spatial prediction of wind farm outputs is
   proposed using the Augmented Kriging-based Model (AKM).}},

Abstract = {{The variability of wind power output is analyzed using the power
   spectral density (PSD) that is estimated through the modified covariance
   method, one of the parametric PSD estimation techniques. This method can
   estimate the PSD accurately under the assumption that the wind power
   follows the Autoregressive process. The seasonal trends are removed
   using the Multiple signal classification to satisfy this assumption
   before estimating the PSD. Phase angles of the wind power are analyzed
   and classified into deterministic and stochastic terms.
   The estimated PSD is modeled through piecewise affine functions, and
   trends of affine functions are encapsulated in multiple linear
   regression models. As the variability of wind power decreases, the slope
   of the third affine function also decreases. Furthermore, the changes of
   the third slope are a function of total capacity, number of wind farms,
   standard deviation, and mean. Therefore, the PSD of future wind power
   can be estimated from multiple linear regression models, and the
   variability of wind power can be quantified through the estimated PSD.}},

   statistical data on key features of the Raman spectrum of graphene over
   large areas, namely 2D, G and D peak intensity and intensity ratios
   between 2D to G (I-2D/I-G) and D to G (I-D/I-G) as well as Full Width at
   Half-Maximum of the 2D peak (FWHM2D). GRISP can also map processed data
   to form mapping images and histogram from which growth quality can be
   easily visualized and quantified. GRISP takes binary or text formatted
   raw data and can be directly accessed from nanoHUB platform, thus is
   universal and independent of the apparatus for Raman spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Mid-IR photoexpansion nano-spectroscopy measures spectra of samples on
   nanoscale by detecting local thermal expansion associated with light
   absorption using a standard atomic force microscope (AFM). Cantilever
   deflection is directly proportional to sample absorption. This method
   results in a simple experimental setup with no optical detectors. We
   have recently demonstrated that the sensitivity of photoexpansion
   nano-spectroscopy can be dramatically enhanced by moving the laser
   pulses repetition frequency in resonance with the mechanical frequency
   of the AFM cantilever. We were able to produce spectra from similar to
   100 nm thin films using low energy (4 nJ) pulses from a tunable quantum
   cascade laser (QCL). The spatial resolution, which is determined by
   thermal diffusion length, has been demonstrated to be better than 50 nm.
   Sample heating is limited to similar to 10 mK. Here we present a novel
   approach to increase both the sensitivity and spatial resolution of
   photoexpansion nano-spectroscopy. We utilize the plasmonic
   local-intensity enhancement below a gold-coated AFM tip. We successfully
   produced high-quality vibrational absorption spectra from samples as
   thin as 10 nm positioned on top of gold-coated silicon substrates. In
   addition to higher photoexpansion signal, our technique features higher
   spatial resolution, which is no longer limited by thermal diffusion
   length but is instead determined by the dimensions of the high-intensity
   field region below the metal tip, which can be 10 nm or smaller.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss the metrology and instrumentation challenges
   that need to be overcome in order to realize true implementation of
   roll-to-roll manufacturing of flexible electronic systems. Several
   metrology and instrumentation challenges involved such as availability
   of particulate-free high quality substrate, development and
   implementation of high-speed in-line and off-line inspection and
   diagnostic tools with adaptive control for patterned and unpatterned
   material films, development of reliable hardware, etc need to be
   addressed and overcome in order to realize a successful manufacturing
   process. Due to extreme resolution requirements compared to print media,
   the burden of software and hardware tools on the throughput also needs
   to be carefully determined. Moreover, the effect of web wander and
   variations in web speed need to accurately be determined in the design
   of the system hardware and software. Realization of successful metrology
   and instrumentation by overcoming the challenges for the development of
   a roll-to-roll manufacturing system for flexible electronic systems
   opens limitless possibilities for the deployment of high performance
   flexible electronic components in a variety of applications including
   communication, sensing, medicine, agriculture, energy, lighting etc.}},

Abstract = {{In the limit of infinite stiffness, the differential equations of motion
   of stiff mechanical systems become differential algebraic equations
   whose solutions stay in a constraint submanifold (P) over cap of the
   phase space. Even though solutions of the stiff differential equations
   are typically oscillatory with large frequency, there exists a slow
   manifold (P) over tilde consisting of nonoscillatory solutions; (P) over
   tilde has the same dimension as (P) over cap and converges to it as the
   stiffness approaches infinity. We introduce an iterative projection
   algorithm, IPA, that projects points in the phase space of a stiff
   mechanical system onto the associated slow manifold (P) over tilde. The
   algorithm is based on ideas such as micro-integration and filtering
   coming from the field of multiscale simulation and is applicable to
   initializing integration algorithms for both stiff ODEs and DAEs,
   including the initialization of Lagrange multipliers. We also illustrate
   in a model situation how the algorithm may be combined with numerical
   integrators for both the stiff system and the limit constrained system.
   These combinations may speed up the solution of stiff problems and also
   be used to integrate DAEs with explicit algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) still remains a problem
   in oil and gas exploration. Radioactive wastes from oil and gas drilling
   take the form of produced water, drilling mud, sludge, slimes, or
   evaporation ponds and pits. In many parts of the USA the soil contains
   radioactivity that is then concentrated in mineral scales on the pipes,
   storage tanks and other extraction equipment. The radionuclides Ra-226
   and its one of daughter products Pb-210 and Ra-228 from Th-232 are the
   primary radionuclides of concern in the waste. We have investigated the
   concentrations of heavy metals in NORM using neutron activation analysis
   (NAA) as well as using passive radioactivity counting using Compton
   suppressed gamma-ray spectrometry. With a low-energy germanium counter
   and the Compton suppression system low detection limits were achieved to
   measure Ra-226, Ra-228 and Pb-210. Results have shown very elevated
   amounts for these radionuclides as well as the heavy metals of barium

Abstract = {{Lung cancer is a major health problem in the United States. Despite the
   development of molecular-targeting agents such as epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and advances made in
   conventional chemoradiotherapy and surgical therapy, the overall
   five-year survival rate of lung cancer patients remains poor and is less
   than 15\%. Recently, in an attempt to improve diagnosis and therapy,
   novel technologies such as nanotechnology have emerged for application
   in medicine. One major goal of nanomedicine is to develop
   multifunctional nanoparticles that can be applied for diagnosis and
   imaging of cancer as well as therapy for cancer. As a result, a number
   of nanoparticle agents of various compositions, sizes, and shapes are
   being developed. A majority of the nanoparticles, however, are in
   preclinical studies, and only a few of them have advanced to early
   clinical testing. Efforts in several laboratories, including our own
   laboratory, are in developing tumor-targeted multifunctional
   metal-iron-oxide-based nanoparticles for imaging and therapy of lung
   cancer. In this article, we will discuss various nanomaterial-based
   nanoparticles, including our own tumor-targeted multifunctional
   nanoparticles that are being developed for lung cancer. Readers are
   encouraged to review additional literature to obtain more information on
   nanomaterials and their application in nanomedicine and cancer therapy.}},

Title = {{ADAPTIVE HESSIAN-BASED NONSTATIONARY GAUSSIAN PROCESS RESPONSE SURFACE
   METHOD FOR PROBABILITY DENSITY APPROXIMATION WITH APPLICATION TO
   BAYESIAN SOLUTION OF LARGE-SCALE INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},

Pages = {{A2837-A2871}},
Abstract = {{We develop an adaptive Hessian-based non-stationary Gaussian process
   (GP) response surface method for approximating a probability density
   function (pdf) that exploits its structure, particularly the Hessian of
   its negative logarithm. Of particular interest to us are pdfs that arise
   from the Bayesian solution of large-scale inverse problems, which imply
   very expensive-to-evaluate pdfs. The method can be considered as a
   piecewise adaptive Gaussian approximation in which a Gaussian tailored
   to the local Hessian of the negative log probability density is
   constructed for each subregion in high dimensional parameter space. The
   task of efficiently partitioning the parameter space into subregions is
   done implicitly through Hessian-informed membership probability
   functions. The GP machinery is then employed to glue all local Gaussian
   approximations into a global analytical response surface that is far
   cheaper to evaluate than the original expensive probability density. The
   resulting response surface is also equipped with an analytical variance
   estimate that can be used to assess the uncertainty of the
   approximation. One of the key components of our proposed approach is an
   adaptive sampling strategy for exploring the parameter space efficiently
   during the computer experimental design step, which aims to find
   training points with high probability density. The detailed construction
   and an analysis of the method are presented. We then demonstrate the
   accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method on several example
   problems, including inverse shape electromagnetic scattering in
   24-dimensional parameter space.}},

   nonequilibrium flows across normal shock waves. Numerical solutions are
   obtained for both pure gases and mixtures at different values of the

   control strategy that prevents excursions into operating regions causing
   failure. In this paper we implement a constrained MIMO model predictive
   controller (MPC) to avoid the failure modes relevant for a
   high-temperature tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system while
   performing load-following. The primary causes of failure are catalyst
   poisoning, fuel or air starvation, carbon deposition, and microcracking.
   Prior steady-state thermomechanical stress analysis in literature has
   demonstrated that the minimum cell temperature and maximum negative
   radial thermal gradient are primary causes of microcracking in the SOFC.
   State-of-the-art SOFC control literature often seeks to track a mean or
   outlet cell temperature. The authors have presented the first approach
   to control the primary two causes of thermally-driven microcracking in
   tubular SOFCs using constrained control. Constraints are also
   incorporated into a steady-state optimization to ensure a feasible
   optimum.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the application of a model predictive controller
   (MPC) to both a traditional and a novel chilled water thermal energy
   storage system over for an Austin, Texas, climate. In the novel system,
   the thermal storage discharges during peak electricity times to meet
   building cooling load and to supply reduced temperature water for heat
   rejection in the chiller's condenser. Chiller efficiency improves as the
   condenser water temperature decreases, shifting more electrical usage to
   off-peak hours, but may increase overall electrical usage. The MPC is
   designed to optimize the discharge and recharge of the thermal storage
   in order to minimize operation costs or energy consumption over a
   24-hour prediction horizon. The ability of MPC to level the electrical
   load profile is also considered. The way in which demand charges are
   considered in the objective function can greatly influence the system's
   electrical load profile.}},

   variable trajectories for statistical process control. Nevertheless,

   divided into multiple states of operation and shifts in operating
   conditions are captured by special variables, named state variables.
   Transition trajectories between states are calculated to determine the
   most likely path between states. This methodology can be implemented in
   the context of empirical monitoring methods, named Multistate PLS. A

Abstract = {{The purpose of the authors' research is to develop a variable ratio
   gearbox (VRG) that enables discrete variable speed operation for
   fixed-speed wind turbines in the production range of 50 to 500 kW.
   Previous work suggests that this device can increase power production by
   7\% over the original configuration. The current study further increases
   the wind capture by applying control to the VRG and mechanical brake. In
   this technique the selected gear ratio produces torque slightly above
   the level that is required, by the generator, for full power. This
   excess torque is removed through the mechanical brake, and full load
   production is realized simultaneously. This paper discusses the
   framework and decision-making protocol used to control these two
   subsystems. The control design process uses dynamic programming to
   insure maximum energy production while conserving brake liner. System
   performance is simulated for twenty sets of wind data that cover a wide
   range of wind conditions. The results demonstrate that full production
   can be achieved across greater ranges of wind speed, and can increase
   electrical production by an average of 10\% for the sites considered.}},

Abstract = {{Video packet losses affect perceived video quality non-uniformly due to
   several factors related to video encoding such as inter-frame coding and
   motion compensation as well as due to psycho-visual perception of
   natural scenes with unequal motion. This motivates protecting video
   packets unequally based on their loss visibility. This paper proposes an
   adaptive online algorithm for unequal error protection driven by two key
   motivations: On one hand, for real-time video, where a video sequence is
   not pre-encoded, an offline approach is infeasible and determining the
   unequal protection levels to maintain a target video quality level must
   be performed online. On the other hand, an online approach enables
   adapting to scene changes as well as changes in video temporal and
   spatial characteristics. The proposed online algorithm uses local linear
   regression to learn the mapping between packet losses from each scalable
   video layer and quality degradation without assuming an underlying
   statistical model. The notion of locality captures the similarity in
   video scene characteristics as well as proximity in time. The algorithm
   provably guarantees an average target video quality level and converges
   rapidly to a stable solution. Furthermore, it provides a bias/variance
   tradeoff between factual estimation of loss visibility and fine
   adaptation to the changing video temporal characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Video streaming over wireless networks can achieve large quality and
   capacity gains from transmission techniques that are aware of the video
   content. This paper proposes modifying conventional multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) systems to realize these gains by introducing
   video-aware PHY layer decisions. Specifically, a new PHY layer packet
   prioritization method is introduced that splits video data among spatial
   streams based on the packet loss visibility and per-stream SNRs. The
   objective is to maximize throughput weighted by packet loss visibility,
   a metric coined perceived throughput. The globally-optimal splitting
   policy among streams is derived. Furthermore, unequal modulation per
   stream is proposed and visibility-based packet dropping is optimized to
   satisfy delay constraints. We derive the gains vs. conventional MIMO
   precoding and prove that the gain is the throughput averaged over
   streams divided by the throughput of the worst stream.}},

Abstract = {{Room-temperature terahertz (THz) quantum cascade laser (QCL) sources
   based on intra-cavity difference-frequency generation (DFG) with record
   THz conversion efficiencies is reported. THz DFG QCLs reported
   previously are highly inefficient since THz radiation produced more than
   similar to 100 mu m away from the exit facet is fully absorbed due to
   high THz losses in the QCL waveguide. Our lasers use a non-collinear
   Cerenkov DFG scheme to extract THz radiation from the active region.
   Dual-color mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers with integrated giant
   optical nonlinearity are grown on semi-insulating (S. I.) InP
   substrates. A lateral current extraction scheme is used. THz radiation
   is emitted at an angle into the substrate with respect to the
   mid-infrared pumps. Since S. I. InP is virtually lossless to THz
   radiation, this scheme allows for efficient extraction of THz radiation
   along the whole waveguide length. As a result, our sources demonstrate
   large mid-infrared-to-THz conversion efficiency and directional THz
   output. Experimentally, proof-of-principle devices demonstrate a
   conversion efficiency up to 70 mu W/W-2 and provide output across a
   1.2-4.5 THz spectral range.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a mathematical programming model and solution method
   for the path-constrained traffic assignment problem, in which route
   choices simultaneously follow the Wardropian equilibrium principle and
   yield the distance constraint imposed on the path. This problem is
   motivated by the need for modeling distance-restrained electric vehicles
   in congested networks, but the resulting model and solution method can
   be applied to various conditions with similar path-based constraints.
   The equilibrium conditions of the problem reveal that any path cost in
   the network is the sum of corresponding link costs and a path-specific
   out-of-range penalty term. The suggested method, based on the classic
   Frank-Wolfe algorithm, incorporates an efficient constrained
   shortest-path algorithm as its subroutine. This algorithm fully exploits
   the underlying network structure of the problem and is relatively easy
   to implement. Numerical results from the examples of problems provided
   show how the equilibrium conditions are reshaped by the path constraint
   and how the traffic flow patterns are affected by different constraint
   tightness levels.}},

Abstract = {{The use of natural fibers in polymer composites is growing rapidly,
   especially in the automotive industry, due to the environmental concern.
   In this research, the open-hole effects on the tensile property of
   kenaf/polypropylene nonwoven composites (ICPNCs) in production of
   automotive interior parts have been investigated. KPNCs were fabricated
   using kenaf fiber as reinforcement and polypropylene (PP) fiber as
   bonding fiber. All KPNCs were produced by carding and needle-punching
   techniques and thermally bonded by' a panel press with 6-mm thickness
   gauges. Unlike the traditional fiber reinforced composites, KPNCs are
   produced by nonwoven technique with a 50\% fiber weight ratio.
   Mechanical properties of the KPNCs in terms of uniaxial tensile and
   open-hole tensile (OHT) were measured instrumentally. By calculating the
   stress concentration factor Kt for brittle materials, the net section
   stress factor Ifn for ductile materials, and the strength reduction
   factor Kr, we found that KPNC was relatively ductile and insensitive to
   the notch.}},

   controlled contents of SDBS-GO, the composite membranes exhibit higher
   IEC, water uptake, and proton conductivity and lower methanol
   permeability than Nafion (R) 112, making them attractive as proton
   exchange membranes (PEMs). These superior characteristics make the

   conformation and encapsulation of acidic drugs}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{11817-11830}},
Abstract = {{We examine the role of neutral dendrimer grafts upon the conformations
   and the drug complexation efficacy of weakly basic polyelectrolyte
   dendrimers by using a self-consistent field theory approach. Our results
   indicate that grafted chains modify the conformations of the dendrimers
   and lead to a swelling of the dendrimer, the degree of which increases
   with increasing chain length of the grafts. In turn, such conformational
   changes leads to a higher charge being carried by the dendrimer
   molecule. We compare the encapsulation efficacy of grafted and
   non-grafted dendrimers and find that for strong enough enthalpic and/or
   electrostatic interactions, the grafted dendrimers are capable of higher
   amounts of encapsulation than the non-grafted counterparts. By isolating
   the influences of electrostatic and enthalpic interactions, we clarify
   the physics behind the observed enhanced encapsulation.}},

Abstract = {{Laser Sintering (LS) is an additive manufacturing process in which a
   part is constructed from powders without the use of part-specific
   tooling. Production of metallic, ceramic and composite parts in some
   cases requires some form of pre-processing or post-process sintering to
   achieve full density. Powder Densification Maps are a tool for
   optimizing the pre- and post-processing parameters. Such maps are
   computational representations of part density as affected by time,
   temperature, pressure and materials properties. This paper summarizes LS
   developments with emphasis on the utility of powder densification
   mapping of powder pre-processing and part post-processing. Specific
   emphasis includes developments in Powder Densification Map production
   for zirconia, Ti-6Al-4V, nickel-based Alloy 625 and copper. A comparison
   of theoretically predicted and experimentally determined densities for a
   variety of processing conditions is presented.}},

   Study}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2282}},
Pages = {{49-56}},
Abstract = {{The natural gas reserve in the Barnett Shale geological formation is one
   of the largest onshore natural gas reserves in the United States. The
   development of a natural gas well is a traffic-intensive operation that
   involves high volumes of truck traffic; saltwater traffic generated
   during the production phase is a major contributor to truck volume. The
   effect of traffic related to the natural gas industry on Texas highways
   is quantified. The oversized and overweight database maintained by the
   Texas Department of Transportation (DOT) was used to quantify several
   key characteristics of the rig traffic. In addition, personnel from the
   Texas DOT's Fort Worth District provided critical information about
   construction and saltwater traffic, including truck types used, gross
   vehicular weights, number of trips, and haul distances. Pavement
   sections were located along the busiest trucking corridors to evaluate
   damage caused by the truck traffic associated with natural gas
   development. Results indicated the approximate damage due to rig traffic
   was 1.6\%, to construction traffic was 13\%, and to saltwater traffic
   was 6\%, relative to the damage caused by design traffic in terms of
   rutting. Additional damage caused by the natural gas truck traffic
   translated into reduced service life for pavements in the region.
   Results indicated a reduced service life of approximately 5.6\%, 29\%,
   and 16\% associated with rig, construction, and saltwater traffic,
   respectively, in terms of rutting.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we propose and demonstrate a novel method to fabricate
   semiconductor devices using a shadow mask that allows selective
   deposition of PECVD layers and selective exposure of doped silicon
   regions. The exposed regions then act as seed layers for selective
   metallization by a process such as electroplating. A device structure
   taking advantage of this process can be completely done without any
   photolithographic steps. In semiconductor processes where
   submicron-feature sizes are generally not required and reducing cost of
   manufacturing is key (e.g. in solar cells), this proposed process flow
   could be really useful. We have fabricated a conventional diffused p-n
   junction monofacial solar cell on a monocrystalline silicon (c-Si)
   substrate using this method. Nickel is electrochemically grown to form
   front surface electrode. The monofacial solar cell fabricated with an
   un-optimized process shows an efficiency of 14.5\% under AM1.5G one sun
   illumination. The feature size of metal electrodes formed in this way is
   80 mu m and could be narrowed down to smaller size-width. Optimization
   of doping, surface passivation and metallization would improve the
   efficiency even further to values in the high teens by improving open
   circuit voltage (V-OC), current density (J(SC)) and Fill Factor (FF).}},

Title = {{A comparison of the energy efficiency of selective laser sintering and
   injection molding of nylon parts}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{472-481}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the energy consumed
   to fabricate nylon parts using selective laser sintering (SLS) and to
   compare it with the energy consumed for injection molding (IM) the same
   parts.
   Design/methodology/approach - Estimates of energy consumption include
   the energy consumed for nylon material refinement, adjusted for SLS and
   IM process yields. Estimates also include the energy consumed by the SLS
   and IM equipment for part fabrication and the energy consumed to machine
   the injection mold and refine the metal feedstock required to fabricate
   it. A representative part is used to size the injection mold and to
   quantify throughput for the SLS machine per build.
   Findings - Although SLS uses significantly more energy than IM during
   part fabrication, this energy consumption is partially offset by the
   energy consumption associated with production of the injection mold. As
   a result, the energy consumed per part for IM decreases with the number
   of parts fabricated while the energy consumed per part for SLS remains
   relatively constant as long as builds are packed efficiently. The
   crossover production volume, at which IM and SLS consume equivalent
   amounts of energy per part, ranges from 50 to 300 representative parts,
   depending on the choice of mold plate material.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to material
   refinement and part fabrication and does not consider other aspects of
   the life cycle, such as waste disposal, distributed 2 manufacturing,
   transportation, recycling or use. Also, the crossover volumes are
   specific to the representative part and are expected to vary with part
   geometry.
   Originality/value - The results of this comparative study of SLS and IM
   energy consumption indicate that manufacturers can save energy using SLS
   for parts with small production volumes. The comparatively large amounts
   of nylon material waste and energy consumption during fabrication make
   it inefficient, from an energy perspective, to use SLS for higher
   production volumes. The crossover production volume depends on the
   geometry of the part and the choice of material for the mold.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse IP cores are integrated on a modern system-on-chip and share
   resources. Off-chip memory bandwidth is often the scarcest resource and
   requires careful allocation. Two of the most important cores, the CPU
   and the GPU, can both simultaneously demand high bandwidth. We
   demonstrate that conventional quality-of-service allocation techniques
   can severely constrict GPU performance by allowing the CPU to
   occasionally monopolize shared bandwidth. We propose to dynamically
   adapt the priority of CPU and GPU memory requests based on a novel
   mechanism that tracks progress of GPU workloads. Our evaluation shows
   that the proposed mechanism significantly improves GPU performance with
   only minimal impact on the CPU.}},

Title = {{Research on Optimal Sensor Placement Based on Reverberation Matrix for
   Structural Health Monitoring}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Adequate sensor placement plays a key role in such fields as system
   identification, structural control, damage detection, and structural
   health monitoring (SHM) of large-scale civil infrastructures. Many
   optimal sensor placement (OSP) methods have been developed for general
   optimized solution searches. Due to the limitations of equipment
   facilities and cost, the number of sensors to be installed in a
   structure is relatively few. It is very important to determine the
   necessary number of sensors to be installed and where to deploy these
   sensors. Taking into account energy attenuate during the signal
   propagation, combined with classic reverberation matrix method, a
   two-step method is proposed to determine the sensors arrangement using
   the scattering matrix in this paper. First, calculate the utmost
   distance of wave propagation on a special structure by the principle of
   elastic wave propagation and determine the preliminary number of
   sensors; second, the utmost distance and number of sensors are applied
   to a sensor optimization algorithm named Effective Independence
   Driving-Point Residue method. In the bridge benchmark model case study,
   it shows the validity of proposed method under a special detection
   system.}},

   different steps are used in the validation process. In the first step,
   the distribution voltage phase angle measurements are plotted with and
   compared to the state estimated transmission level voltage phase angle.
   The second step is the comparison of distribution level PMU measurements
   to transmission level PMU measurements during a power system transient
   response. The frequency, voltage magnitude, and voltage phase angle are
   analyzed during a unit trip event. In the final step, the modal
   frequency and damping estimates are used to illustrate the accuracy of
   distribution measurements as representative of the power system's
   ambient response. Because of the location of the PMUs within the
   network, it will also be possible to measure the effects of wind power

Abstract = {{One of the most effective methods of enhanced oil recovery is chemical
   flooding. This process can significantly increase the oil recovery;
   however, it involves high risks and uncertainties. We determined the
   optimal chemical flooding design, which is the maximum of the net
   present value (NPV), using the UT\_IRSP platform and an in-house
   chemical flooding simulator, as well as the application of experimental
   design and respond surface for a particular oil reservoir. Surfactant
   and polymer mass, k(v)/k(h) ratio, salinity of polymer drive, and
   salinity of post-water flood were variables used in our optimisation
   calculations. We found that the interaction between the surfactant
   concentration and surfactant slug size is the most important term
   affecting the NPV. Therefore, the oil recovery was improved by 8\% of
   the original oil in place (OOIP) in a designed chemical flooding case
   scenario. Also, the NPV with tax and royalty increased notably from 6.42
   MM USD to 8.08 MM USD for the 50 USD/bbl of oil price. {[}Received:

Abstract = {{This paper outlines a low-cost, low-power, arc-minute accurate star
   tracker that is designed for use on a CubeSat. The device is being
   developed at the University of Texas at Austin for use on two different
   3-unit CubeSat missions. The hardware consists of commercial
   off-the-shelf parts designed for use in industrial machine vision
   systems and employs a 1024x768 grey-scale charge coupled device (CCD)
   sensor. The software includes the three standard steps in star tracking:
   centroiding, star identification, and attitude determination.
   Centroiding algorithms were developed in-house. The star identification
   code was adapted from the Pyramid Star Identification technique
   developed by Mortari. Attitude determination was performed using
   Markley's singular value decomposition method. The star tracker was then
   tested with both internal and external simulated star-fields and
   night-sky tests. The resulting accuracy was on the order of arc-minutes.
   It was concluded that this system is a viable option for CubeSats
   looking to improve their attitude determination. Further proof of the
   system will be obtained when the star tracker flies on the planned
   CubeSat missions in 2013 or later.}},

   consistency, stability, and convergence analyses for nonconforming
   approximations follow the conforming counterparts with minimal

   equivalent conforming faces on mortars, for which the analyses are

Title = {{A STOCHASTIC NEWTON MCMC METHOD FOR LARGE-SCALE STATISTICAL INVERSE
   PROBLEMS WITH APPLICATION TO SEISMIC INVERSION}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{We address the solution of large-scale statistical inverse problems in
   the framework of Bayesian inference. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   method is the most popular approach for sampling the posterior
   probability distribution that describes the solution of the statistical
   inverse problem. MCMC methods face two central difficulties when applied
   to large-scale inverse problems: first, the forward models (typically in
   the form of partial differential equations) that map uncertain
   parameters to observable quantities make the evaluation of the
   probability density at any point in parameter space very expensive; and
   second, the high-dimensional parameter spaces that arise upon
   discretization of infinite-dimensional parameter fields make the
   exploration of the probability density function prohibitive. The
   challenge for MCMC methods is to construct proposal functions that
   simultaneously provide a good approximation of the target density while
   being inexpensive to manipulate. Here we present a so-called Stochastic
   Newton method in which MCMC is accelerated by constructing and sampling
   from a proposal density that builds a local Gaussian approximation based
   on local gradient and Hessian (of the log posterior) information. Thus,
   the method exploits tools (adjoint-based gradients and Hessians) that
   have been instrumental for fast (often mesh-independent) solution of
   deterministic inverse problems. Hessian manipulations (inverse, square
   root) are made tractable by a low-rank approximation that exploits the
   compact nature of the data misfit operator. This is analogous to a
   reduced model of the parameter-to-observable map. The method is applied
   to the Bayesian solution of an inverse medium problem governed by 1D
   seismic wave propagation. We compare the Stochastic Newton method with a
   reference black box MCMC method as well as a gradient-based Langevin
   MCMC method, and observe at least two orders of magnitude improvement in
   convergence for problems with up to 65 parameters. Numerical evidence
   suggests that a 1025 parameter problem converges at the same rate as the
   65 parameter problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the recovery of multiple sparse vectors, with
   partially shared supports, from a small number of noisy linear
   measurements of each. It has recently been shown that it is possible to
   lower the sample complexity of recovery, for all levels of support
   sharing, by using a ``dirty model{''}: a super-position of sparse and
   group-sparse modeling approaches; this is based on convex optimization.
   In this paper, we provide a new forward-backward greedy procedure for
   the dirty model approach. Each forward step involves the addition of
   either a shared feature common to all vectors, or a unique feature to
   one of the vectors, chosen in a natural greedy fashion. Each backward
   step involves greedy removal, again of at most one feature of either
   type.
   Analytical and empirical evidence shows that this outperforms all convex
   approaches, in terms of both sample and computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Drug cocktails formed by mixing multiple drugs at various doses provide
   more effective cures than single-drug treatments. However, drugs
   interact in highly nonlinear ways making the determination of the
   optimal combination a difficult task. The response surface of the drug
   cocktail has to be estimated through expensive and time-consuming
   experimentation. Previous research focused on the use of
   space-exploratory heuristics such as genetic algorithms to guide the
   search for optimal combinations. While being more efficient than random
   sampling, these methods require a considerable amount of experiments to
   converge to good solutions. In this paper, we propose to use an
   information-theoretic active learning approach under the Bayesian
   framework of Gaussian processes to adaptively choose what experiments to
   perform based on current data points. We show that our approach is able

Abstract = {{Greedy Maximal Scheduling (GMS) is an attractive low-complexity scheme
   for scheduling in wireless networks. Recent work has characterized its
   throughput for the case when there is no fading/channel variations. This
   paper aims to understand the effect of channel variations on the
   relative throughput performance of GMS vis-a-vis that of an optimal
   scheduler facing the same fading. The effect is not a-priori obvious
   because, on the one hand, fading could help by decoupling/precluding
   global states that lead to poor GMS performance, while on the other hand
   fading adds another degree of freedom in which an event unfavorable to
   GMS could occur.
   We show that both these situations can occur when fading is adversarial.
   In particular, we first define the notion of a Fading Local Pooling
   factor (F-LPF), and show that it exactly characterizes the throughput of
   GMS in this setting. We also derive general upper and lower bounds on
   F-LPF. Using these bounds, we provide two example networks - one where
   the relative performance of GMS is worse than if there were no fading,
   and one where it is better.}},

Abstract = {{User perceived video quality depends on a variety of only partially
   understood factors, e. g., the application domain, content, compression,
   transport mechanism, and most importantly psycho-visual systems
   determining the ultimate Quality of Experience (QoE) of users. This
   paper centers on two key observations in addressing the problem of joint
   rate adaptation for video streams sharing a congested resource. First,
   we note that a user viewing a given video will experience temporal
   variations in the dependence of perceived video quality to the
   compression rate. Intuitively this is due to the possibly changing
   nature of the content, e. g., from an action to a slower scene. Thus, in
   allocating rates to users sharing a congested resource, in particular a
   wireless system where additional temporal variability in users' capacity
   may be high, content dependent tradeoffs can be realized to deliver a
   better overall average perceived video quality. Second, we note that
   such adaptation of users' rates, may result in temporal variations in
   video quality which combined with perceptual hysteresis effects will
   degrade users' QoE. We develop an asymptotically optimal online
   algorithm, requiring minimal statistical information, for optimizing
   users' QoE by realizing tradeoffs across mean, variance and fairness.
   Simulations show that our approach achieves significant gains in
   viewers' QoE.
   The novelty of this work lies not only in tackling the fundamental
   problem of achieving fair allocations of perceived video quality across
   a user population with time varying sensitivities and capacity, but, in
   addition, in integrating the deleterious impact that variations in
   perceived quality has on their QoE.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a server serving a time-slotted queued system of multiple
   packet-based flows, where not more than one flow can be serviced in a
   single time slot. The flows have exogenous packet arrivals and
   time-varying service rates. At each time, the server can observe
   instantaneous service rates for only a subset of flows (selected from a
   fixed collection of observable subsets) before scheduling a flow in the
   subset for service. We are interested in queue-length aware scheduling
   to keep the queues short. The limited availability of instantaneous
   service rate information requires the scheduler to make a careful choice
   of which subset of service rates to sample. We develop scheduling
   algorithms that use only partial service rate information from subsets
   of channels, and that minimize the likelihood of queue overflow in the
   system. Specifically, we present a new joint subset-sampling and
   scheduling algorithm called Max-Exp that uses only the current queue
   lengths to pick a subset of flows, and subsequently schedules a flow
   using the Exponential rule. When the collection of observable subsets is
   disjoint, we show that Max-Exp achieves the best exponential decay rate,
   among all scheduling algorithms using partial information, of the tail
   of the longest queue in the system. To accomplish this, we introduce
   novel analytical techniques for studying the performance of scheduling
   algorithms using partial state information, that are of independent
   interest. These include new sample-path large deviations results for
   processes obtained by nonrandom, predictable sampling of sequences of
   independent and identically distributed random variables, which show
   that scheduling with partial state information yields a rate function
   significantly different from the case of full information. As a special
   case, Max-Exp reduces to simply serving the flow with the longest queue
   when the observable subsets are singleton flows, i.e., when there is
   effectively no a priori channel-state information; thus, our results
   show that this greedy scheduling policy is large-deviations optimal.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-carrier grouping is a popular feedback reduction approach for
   orthogonal-frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) systems that has
   been adopted into fourth-generation standards such as 3GPP Long Term
   Evolution (LTE). Feedback reduction is motivated by the fact that the
   bandwidth expenditure in acquiring full information in a downlink OFDMA
   system scales as the product of the number of users and the number of
   OFDMA bands. As this is infeasible in most systems, sub-carrier grouping
   calls for users to report a single channel state value per
   pre-designated group of OFDM bands. Such an approach would reduce the
   amount of feedback by a factor that is equal to the size of the group,
   albeit at a loss in throughput. In this paper, we propose a
   throughput-optimal joint sub-carrier grouping and data scheduling policy
   that makes decisions based on queue-lengths and channel states in each
   time slot. The feedback allocation or sub-carrier grouping policy,
   inspired by the current approach in LTE, operates under a total feedback
   budget and must periodically decide a sub-carrier grouping size for each
   user that obeys this resource constraint. However, as we show, the
   optimal allocation algorithm has complexity that, in general, scales
   exponentially in the number of users. Thus, we turn our attention to the
   important issue of computational efficiency and propose a greedy
   algorithm that allocates full feedback bandwidth to a constant-sized
   subset of users based on the network state. We evaluate the performance
   of this simple approach through extensive numerical experiments. We show

Abstract = {{TV Whitespaces, recently opened up by the FCC for unlicensed use by
   wireless devices, are seen as a potential cellular offload solution,
   especially in dense metros. However, under the new database-driven
   guidelines, there are typically very few whitespace bands available in
   such dense metros to a high-powered fixed device, which plays the role
   of a cellular base station in whitespaces. To address the lack of
   degrees-of-freedom (DoF) with this traditional architecture of one
   high-powered serving device, we propose a novel base station design that
   co-locates and networks together many low-powered devices to act as a
   multiple-antenna array. Lower-powered whitespace devices have access to
   more spectral DoF, a property that is unique to whitespaces. In the
   first part of the paper, we solve an array design problem where we
   estimate the size of the array required to meet long-term (worst-case)
   throughput targets. Using extensive simulations, we show that by
   effectively exploiting both spatial and spectral DoF, the array design
   outperforms the traditional design in most network conditions.
   Specifically, the proposed design can support throughputs of the order
   of a WiMAX cell running applications such as high-definition television.
   In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention to the
   operational aspects of such a design. Recognizing that the proposed
   array can potentially contain hundreds of elements, we propose a dynamic
   ON-OFF power control algorithm that operates in conjunction with the
   MaxWeight data scheduling algorithm and responds to the current network
   state - queues and channels - of the system, thus making the system
   power-efficient.}},

Abstract = {{A method for automating the design of gear trains comprised of simple,
   compound, bevel and worm is described. The search process combines
   topological changes, discrete variable choices and continuous variable
   optimization. By combing best-first search, implicit enumeration,
   automated optimization invocation and gradient-based optimization, a
   near guarantee of the optimal solution can be made. While the
   combination of methods is specific to gear trains, there are aspects of
   the work that make it amenable to other engineering design problems. In
   addition, the topological and discrete modifications to the candidate
   solutions are specific to gear trains, but the graph grammar methodology
   that is adopted has been tailored to other problems. This article
   presents details on the rules that generate feasible gear trains, the
   evaluation routines used in determining the objective functions and
   constraints, and the interaction among the three search methods.
   Resulting gear trains are presented for a variety of gear problems.}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale wave propagation problems are computationally costly to solve
   by traditional techniques because the smallest scales must be
   represented over a domain determined by the largest scales of the
   problem. We have developed and analyzed new numerical methods for
   multiscale wave propagation in the framework of the heterogeneous
   multiscale method (HMM). The numerical methods couple simulations on
   macro- and microscales for problems with rapidly oscillating
   coefficients. The complexity of the new method is significantly lower
   than that of traditional techniques with a computational cost that is
   essentially independent of the smallest scale, when computing solutions
   at a fixed time and accuracy. We show numerical examples of the HMM
   applied to long time integration of wave propagation problems in both
   periodic and non-periodic medium. In both cases our HMM accurately
   captures the dispersive effects that occur. We also give a stability
   proof for the HMM, when it is applied to long time wave propagation
   problems.}},

Pages = {{14495-14499}},
Abstract = {{Realization of a ubiquitous clean energy future depends critically on
   the efficient storage and utilization of renewable energies. Lithium-ion
   batteries are appealing in this regard, but low-cost, abundant, safe,
   high energy-density electrode materials need to be developed to adopt
   them. Here we present a sulfur-multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
   composite cathode with high-rate cyclability by a facile binder/current
   collector-free fabrication process. The composite cathode exhibits high
   capacities of 1352 mAh g(-1) at 1C rate and 1012 mAh g(-1) at 4C rate.
   Due to the self-weaving behavior of MWCNTs, extra cell components such
   as binders and current collectors are rendered unnecessary, thereby
   streamlining the electrode manufacturing process and decreasing the cell
   weight. While the highly conductive MWCNTs improve the active material
   utilization at high rates, the absorption ability of the cathode
   framework localizes the electrolyte and suppresses the migration of
   soluble polysulfides. The cathode design and facile synthesis enhance
   the feasibility of practical high rate Li-S batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by possible generalizations to more complex multiphase
   multicomponent systems in higher dimensions, we develop an
   Eulerian-Lagrangian numerical approximation for a system of two
   conservation laws in one space dimension modeling a simplified two-phase
   flow problem in a porous medium. The method is based on following
   tracelines, so it is stable independent of any CFL constraint. The main
   difficulty is that it is not possible to follow individual tracelines
   independently. We approximate tracing along the tracelines by using
   local mass conservation principles and self-consistency. The two-phase
   flow problem is governed by a system of equations representing mass
   conservation of each phase, so there are two local mass conservation
   principles. Our numerical method respects both of these conservation
   principles over the computational mesh ( i.e., locally), and so is a
   fully conservative traceline method. We present numerical results that
   demonstrate the ability of the method to handle problems with shocks and
   rarefactions, and to do so with very coarse spatial grids and time steps
   larger than the CFL limit.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by an emerging theory of robust low-rank matrix
   representation, in this paper, we introduce a novel solution for online
   rigid-body motion registration. The goal is to develop algorithmic
   techniques that enable a robust, real-time motion registration solution
   suitable for low-cost, portable 3-D camera devices. Assuming 3-D image
   features are tracked via a standard tracker, the algorithm first
   utilizes Robust PCA to initialize a low-rank shape representation of the
   rigid body. Robust PCA finds the global optimal solution of the
   initialization, while its complexity is comparable to singular value
   decomposition. In the online update stage, we propose a more efficient
   algorithm for sparse subspace projection to sequentially project new
   feature observations onto the shape subspace. The lightweight update
   stage guarantees the real-time performance of the solution while
   maintaining good registration even when the image sequence is
   contaminated by noise, gross data corruption, outlying features, and
   missing data. The state-of-the-art accuracy of the solution is validated
   through extensive simulation and a real-world experiment, while the
   system enjoys one to two orders of magnitude speed-up compared to
   well-established RANSAC solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to create precise, predesigned, spatially patterned
   biochemical and physical microenvironments inside polymer scaffolds
   could provide a powerful tool in studying progenitor cell behavior and

   become a promising tool for the manufacturing of biological scaffolds
   for tissue regeneration and stem cell engineering. Freeform fabrication
   is a very promising technology due to the efficient and simple process
   for creating bona fide 3D microstructures, such as closed channels and
   cavities. It is also capable of encapsulating biomolecules and even
   living cells.
   This chapter describes direct projection printing of 3D tissue
   engineering scaffolds by using a digital micromirror-array device (DMD)
   in a layer-by-layer process. This simple and fast microstereolithography
   system consists of an ultraviolet (UV) light source, a digital
   micromirror masking device, imaging optics, and controlling devices.
   Images of UV light are projected onto the photocurable resin by creating

Abstract = {{The kinetics and mechanism of removal of the fluoroquinolone
   antibacterial levofloxacin (LFC) by free available chlorine (FAC) during
   water chlorination processes have been investigated for the first time
   between pH values 4.2 and 8.5. The pH-dependent second-order rate
   constants were found to decrease with increase in pH (e.g. apparent
   second order rate constant; k `'(app) = 20 dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) at pH 4.2
   and k `'(app) = 1dm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) at pH 8.5 and at 25 degrees C). The
   products of the reaction were determined by liquid chromatography and
   high resolution mass spectrometry. There are two plausible pathways for
   the LFC chlorination. The major channel is electrophilic
   halodecarboxylation of the quinolone moiety in which HOCl reacts at
   tertiary N(4) amine to form a reactive chlorammonium intermediate
   (R3N(4)Cl+) that can catalytically halogenate LFC, and the minor channel
   is chlorination at the piperazinyl moiety in which HOCl reacts at
   tertiary N(4) amine to form a reactive chlorammonium intermediate
   (R3N(4)Cl+) followed by intermediate degradation both at the piperazinyl
   and quinolone moieties with successive chlorination. The effect of
   temperature on the rate of the reaction was studied at four different
   temperatures and rate constants were found to increase with increase in
   temperature and the thermodynamic activation parameters E-a, Delta H-not
   equal, Delta S-not equal and Delta G(not equal) were evaluated and
   discussed.}},

   applications using simplicial meshes typically impose restrictions on
   both the smoothness of the interpolated functions and the shape of the

   well-shaped auxiliary spatial partition, error estimates are established
   under minimal function smoothness and mesh regularity. This construction
   is especially important in two cases: L-p(Omega) estimates for data in
   W-1,W-p(Omega) hold for meshes without any restrictions on simplex
   shape, and W-1,W-p(Omega) estimates for data in W-2,W-p(Omega) hold

Abstract = {{A novel digital calibration technique based on component redundancy and
   random diversity (CRRD) is used to enable robust high-gain
   positive-feedback (PF) amplifiers. Gain enhancement is achieved through
   output conductance cancellation which requires accurate calibration
   across process, voltage, and temperature. CRRD employs a set of
   redundant elements intentionally exhibiting high local variability, and
   the subset of the elements that best cancels amplifier's output
   conductance is employed. We develop a novel design methodology to
   rigorously predict: (1) how to partition the full configuration range
   between a fixed load and a tunable load, and (2) how, for a given
   partition, to size the tunable load elements. We prove that having a
   sizable coarse load is essential for reaching optimality.
   We apply the developed theory to the design of a 0.18 mu m CMOS
   test-chip implementing a 6x10 array of high-gain PF amplifiers based on
   CRRD. We demonstrate that the use of CRRD allows only linear increase of
   the array size, and its associated capacitance, with dB gain
   improvement, in contrast to exponential increase in earlier designs.
   Gains of ninety amplifiers from three different dies were measured and
   exceeded 64dB for 95\% of the samples, up from an intrinsic gain of
   28.5dB. A gain-bandwidth product of 186MHz was measured while consuming
   65 mu A from a 1.8V supply.}},

Abstract = {{The logical structure of a forest of octrees can be used to create
   scalable algorithms for parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), which
   has recently been demonstrated for several petascale applications. Among
   various frequently used octree-based mesh operations, including
   refinement, coarsening, partitioning, and enumerating nodes, ensuring a
   2:1 size balance between neighboring elements has historically been the
   most expensive in terms of CPU time and communication volume. The 2:1
   balance operation is thus a primary target to optimize.
   One important component of a parallel balance algorithm is the ability
   to determine whether any two given octants have a consistent
   distance/size relation. Based on new logical concepts we propose fast
   algorithms for making this decision for all types of 2: 1 balance
   conditions in 2D and 3D. Since we are able to achieve this without
   constructing any parent nodes in the tree that would otherwise need to
   be sorted and communicated, we can significantly reduce the required
   memory and communication volume. In addition, we propose a lightweight
   collective algorithm for reversing the asymmetric communication pattern
   induced by non-local octant interactions.
   We have implemented our improvements as part of the open-source
   ``p4est{''} software. Benchmarking this code with both synthetic and
   simulation-driven adapted meshes we are able to demonstrate much reduced
   runtime and excellent weak and strong scalability. On our largest
   benchmark problem with 5.13 x 10(11) octants the new 2:1 balance
   algorithm executes in less than 8 seconds on 112,128 CPU cores of the
   Jaguar Cray XT5 supercomputer.}},

Abstract = {{A recently developed precession electron diffraction (PED) technique in

   width and the thickness of the line, respectively and a low fraction of
   coherent twin boundaries. The microstructure characteristics were
   applied to evaluate the grain structure effect on electromigration (EM)
   reliability. We first extracted the interfacial diffusivity components
   for (111), (110), and (100) surfaces and the averaged grain boundary
   diffusivity by analyzing the resistance traces observed in EM tests.
   Then the flux divergence at the triple points of grain boundary
   intersecting the interface was calculated to identify potential voiding
   sites. Similar analysis was extended to via/line regions to evaluate the
   flux divergence for slit void formation and to assess the probability of

Abstract = {{A technique is developed for reconstructing a continuous phase time
   history from the noncontinuous phase bursts of time division multiple
   access (TDMA) signals. A continuous phase time history facilitates
   exploitation of TDMA signals as signals of opportunity (SOPs) within an
   opportunistic navigation framework. Because of their widespread use and
   availability in today's wireless communication market, TDMA signals are
   attractive candidate SOPs for opportunistic navigation. The phase
   reconstruction technique presented here combines an integer least
   squares technique for estimating phase ambiguities at the beginning of
   each TDMA phase burst with a Kalman filter and smoother for removing
   these ambiguities and optimally ``stitching{''} the bursts together. A
   Monte-Carlo-type simulation and test environment has been developed to
   investigate the sensitivity of the proposed phase reconstruction
   technique to various system parameters, namely, carrier-to-noise ratio,
   receiver clock quality, TDMA transmitter clock quality, line-of-sight
   acceleration uncertainty, and TDMA burst structure. Simulation results
   indicate that successful carrier phase reconstruction is most strongly
   dependent on the TDMA burst period and on the combined phase random walk
   effect of the receiver and transmitter clocks, the propagation effects,

Abstract = {{Coulomb formations refer to swarms of closely-flying spacecraft, in
   which the net electric charge of each vehicle is controlled. Active
   charge control is central to this concept and enables a propulsion
   system with highly desirable characteristics, albeit with limited
   controllability. Numerous Coulomb equilibria have been derived (for
   various force models), but to maintain and maneuver these
   configurations, some inertial thrust is required to supplement the
   nearly propellant-less charge control. In this work, invariant manifold
   theory is applied to dynamically unstable Coulomb configurations, as
   part of a generalized procedure to formulate and parameterize optimal
   transfers from one Coulomb configuration to another. The emphasis is on
   minimizing the inertial thrust necessary to complete such
   reconfigurations, in part, by exploiting uncontrolled motion along the
   manifolds. The possible permutations and variations for modeling the
   optimal transfers, that are within the scope of the general methodology,
   are discussed. Numerical results are then provided, as demonstrative
   examples of the optimization procedure, using a two-craft Coulomb
   formation model with linearized two-body gravity and simple control
   parameterizations. Particle Swarm Optimization, a novel stochastic
   method, is used to solve the optimal transfer problems and its adeptness
   at doing so, as well as its additional utility in Coulomb formation
   research, is addressed.}},

   horizontal reference frame. It is also assumed that the transfer is
   quasi-planar and that the thrust pitch and yaw angles are small. The
   solution of the resulting two-point boundary value problem involves
   modified thrust integrals and requires three quadratures and one
   iteration. Results are presented for the optimal trajectory. A result of
   this solution is that a variable multiplier can be assumed constant,
   leading to an analytical solution (without quadrature and without
   iteration) in terms of the well known thrust integrals. These are new
   solutions for the constant-thrust, minimum-time transfer problem over a
   spherical body.
   Both solutions are tested in a sample and hold guidance scheme. First,
   the out-of-plane initial conditions are set to zero. The planar results
   show that both solutions satisfy the final conditions, consume the same
   mass, and use approximately the same thrust pitch angle history. Second,
   to test out-of-plane performance, the out-of-plane initial conditions
   are changed to be non-zero. Results are similar. Because the second
   solution is analytical, it merits further consideration as an onboard
   guidance algorithm. It is the best analytical solution to date for
   quasi-planar ascent over a spherical body.}},

Abstract = {{Relative navigation using angles-only observations is explored in this
   research. Previous work has shown that the unique relative orbit of a
   deputy satellite cannot be found using angles-only camera measurements
   from the chief satellite when a linear model of relative motion is used,
   due to a lack of observability. This work examines the possibility of
   partial observability, which in this case consists of a basis vector
   that corresponds to a family of relative orbits. An initial orbit
   determination (IOD) method is introduced that uses 3 Line-Of-Sight (LOS)
   measurements and provides an initial guess for the basis vector. This
   guess is differentially corrected with a batch estimator that takes in a
   full set of LOS measurements to hone in on a converged solution for the
   basis vector.}},

Abstract = {{Wide SIMD-based GPUs have evolved into a promising platform for running
   general purpose workloads. Current programmable GPUs allow even code
   with irregular control to execute well on their SIMD pipelines. To do
   this, each SIMD lane is considered to execute a logical thread where
   hardware ensures that control flow is accurate by automatically applying
   masked execution. The masked execution, however, often degrades
   performance because the issue slots of masked lanes are wasted. This
   degradation can be mitigated by dynamically compacting multiple unmasked
   threads into a single SIMD unit. This paper proposes a fundamentally new
   approach to branch compaction that avoids the unnecessary
   synchronization required by previous techniques and that only stalls
   threads that are likely to benefit from compaction. Our technique is
   based on the compaction-adequacy predictor (CAPRI). CAPRI dynamically
   identifies the compaction-effectiveness of a branch and only stalls
   threads that are predicted to benefit from compaction. We utilize a
   simple single-level branch-predictor inspired structure and show that
   this simple configuration attains a prediction accuracy of 99.8\% and
   86.6\% for non-divergent and divergent workloads, respectively. Our
   performance evaluation demonstrates that CAPRI consistently outperforms
   both the baseline design that never attempts compaction and prior work
   that stalls upon all divergent branches.}},

   outpaces available memory bandwidth, however, the system bottleneck will

   transfers, saves power, and improves system performance by dynamically
   changing between fine and coarse-grained memory accesses. DGMS predicts
   memory access granularities dynamically in hardware, and does not

   superior ease of implementation and power efficiency relative to prior

Abstract = {{Modern memory systems rely on spatial locality to provide high bandwidth
   while minimizing memory device power and cost. The trend of increasing
   the number of cores that share memory, however, decreases apparent
   spatial locality because access streams from independent threads are
   interleaved. Memory access scheduling recovers only a fraction of the
   original locality because of buffering limits. We investigate new
   techniques to reduce inter-thread access interference. We propose to
   partition the internal memory banks between cores to isolate their
   access streams and eliminate locality interference. We implement this by
   extending the physical frame allocation algorithm of the OS such that
   physical frames mapped to the same DRAM bank can be exclusively
   allocated to a single thread. We compensate for the reduced bank-level
   parallelism of each thread by employing memory sub-ranking to
   effectively increase the number of independent banks. This combined
   approach, unlike memory bank partitioning or sub-ranking alone,
   simultaneously increases overall performance and significantly reduces
   memory power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) scheme to measure high
   speed double data rate (DDR) memory output timing using low cost
   testers. This technique uses an on-chip pattern generator to generate a
   time delay between data and data-strobe or clock. The time delay is
   controlled precisely using a phase interpolator based cycle-by-cycle
   control method. A novel method for testing the resolution of phase
   interpolator, which does not need any extra hardware, is also presented.
   Using the test resolution, a timing pass/fail flag is set and the timing
   margin is quantified as a multiple of the test clock cycle. Since these
   test results have high observability, output per-pin timing performance
   can be diagnosed easily, which is especially good for testing parallel
   memory interfaces. Moreover, these features make our scheme compatible
   with low-cost testers and decreases the time-to-market for the chip. The
   BIST circuit has been implemented using the 0.18-mu m CMOS process, and
   chip measurement results are presented. We obtained a test resolution of
   10 ps for testing output timing. Using the fabricated test chip, this
   paper shows the effects of switching noise, per-pin skews and slew-rate
   change on output timing variations.}},

Abstract = {{Technology scaling introduces many sources of variability and
   uncertainty that are difficult to model and predict {[}3]. The result of
   these uncertainties is a degradation in our ability to predict the
   performance of fabricated chips, i.e., a lack of model-to-hardware
   matching. The prediction of circuit performance is the result of a
   complex hierarchy of models starting at the basic MOSFET device model
   and rising to full-chip models of important performance metrics like
   power, frequency of operation, etc. The assessment of the quality of
   such models is an important activity, but it is becoming harder and more
   complex with rising levels of variability, as well as with the increase
   in the number of systematic effects observed in modern CMOS processes.
   The purpose of this paper is to introduce a special-purpose test
   structure that specifically focuses on ensuring the accuracy of gate
   timing models. The certification of digital design correctness (the
   so-called signoff) is based largely on the results of performing a
   Static Timing Analysis (STA) {[}15], {[}18], which, in turn, is based
   entirely on the gate timing models. Our test structure compares
   favorably to alternative approaches; it is far easier to obtain the
   desired results than direct delay measurement, and it is much more
   general than simple ring oscillator structures. Further, the structure
   is specified at a high level, allowing it to be synthesized using a
   standard ASIC place-and-route flow, thus capturing the systematic local
   layout effects which can sometimes be lost by simpler (e. g., ring
   oscillator) structures. Experimental results show the structure can play
   an important role in identifying mismatches between timing models and
   observed hardware.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative to masking unknown (X) values before the compactor (i.e.,
   X-masking) is to capture X's in the MISR and cancel them out after
   compaction (i.e., X-canceling). Existing X-canceling methodologies
   require a number of control bits to perform the X-canceling that is
   linear in the number of X's to be canceled. This paper describes a new
   methodology for X-canceling which can exploit the fact that the scan
   cells in which X's are captured tend to be highly correlated in order to
   significantly reduce the number of control bits required for
   X-canceling. X's tend to be generated in certain portions of the design,
   and hence certain scan cells capture X's with much higher frequency than
   other scan cells. Instead of custom generating the control bits to
   cancel out only the X's in one MISR signature, the proposed approach
   finds a general superset solution which can cancel out the X's for many
   MISR signatures. This allows the same control bits to be reused many
   times thereby significantly improving the amount of compression that can
   be obtained. Architectures for implementing superset X-canceling are
   described along with experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{As process technology continues to shrink, Negative Bias Temperature
   Instability (NBTI) has become a major reliability issue in CMOS
   circuits. NBTI degrades the threshold voltage of the PMOS transistor
   and, over time, causes the operating speed of the circuit to become
   slower (also known as the aging effect). In this paper, we introduce a
   new aging-aware Flip-Flop (FF) that is based on accurate, run-time
   Failure Prediction. In order to maintain prediction accuracy despite
   aging, we use two schemes: (a) the master latch in the main FF is
   duplicated and used as an aging monitor so that it can have the same
   aging effect as that of the main FF; (b) the delay element that is used
   for the guardband is inserted into the clock network to utilize the
   recovery effect of NBTI. These schemes keep the guardband virtually
   constant, which reduces the likelihood of both overestimating the aging
   effect and failing to detect it. The SPICE simulation results reveal
   that our FF architecture maintains its prediction accuracy for up to 10
   years as a result of keeping its guardband almost completely constant.}},

Abstract = {{The risk management group at the South Texas Project Electric Generating
   Station (STPEGS) has successfully developed a Preventive Maintenance
   (PM) optimization application based on a new mathematical model
   developed in collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin. This
   model uses historical maintenance data from the STPEGS work management
   database. Robust statistical analysis, coupled with an efficient
   algorithm generates an optimal PM schedule, based on a Non-Homogenous
   Poisson Process (NHPP) with a power law failure rate function. In
   addition, the risk associated with significant plant events triggered by
   a component failure is appropriately captured in the Corrective
   Maintenance (CM) cost estimates. The probabilities of such events are
   modeled via fault tree analysis, and consequences re expressed as
   monetary costs. The net cost of CM is then modified by a weighted sum of
   the probability of each event multiplied its monetary cost. The ratio of
   risk-adjusted CM cost to PM cost is used with the failure rate
   parameters to calculate the optimum PM frequency that minimizes combined
   CM and PM costs. The software can evaluate individual components or
   entire systems of components. Several low-risk ranked systems have been
   evaluated. In this paper we present the results of these evaluations}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the feasibility of active clamping techniques in
   isolated time-sharing multiple-input converters. Additional losses
   caused by energy transfer into the input switches from the leakage
   inductance in the isolating coupled-inductor are addressed with a common
   active clamping leg for all input legs. An active clamping technique is
   applied to isolated time-sharing multiple-input converters to minimize
   the additional switching losses, and the paper also conducts an
   operational analysis of a dual-input isolated single ended primary
   inductor converter (2IISEPIC) with the active clamping technique.
   Zero-voltage-switching can be achieved on the first-turned-on input leg
   and the active clamping leg with proper driving strategy and circuit
   parameter settings. Discussions on the effect of the active clamping
   technique to a multiple-input converter and the components stresses of
   the 2IISEPIC with the active clamping technique have also been made to
   assist in the design of time-sharing multiple-input converters. A
   prototype of the 2IISEPIC with the active clamping technique is built
   for efficiency and stresses verification, and it is showed that 94\%
   efficiency is achievable at 200W output power and the component stresses
   are significantly reduced, especially the voltage stresses on input
   switches. An absolute 6\% improvement over the efficiency of the same
   circuit without soft-switching techniques is observed.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an infinite-dimensional adjoint-based inexact Gauss-Newton
   method for the solution of inverse problems governed by Stokes models of
   ice sheet flow with nonlinear rheology and sliding law. The method is
   applied to infer the basal sliding coefficient and the rheological
   exponent parameter fields from surface velocities. The inverse problem
   is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem whose
   cost functional is the misfit between surface velocity observations and
   model predictions. A Tikhonov regularization term is added to the cost
   functional to render the problem well-posed and account for
   observational error. Our findings show that the inexact Newton method is
   significantly more efficient than the nonlinear conjugate gradient
   method and that the number of Stokes solutions required to solve the
   inverse problem is insensitive to the number of inversion parameters.
   The results also show that the reconstructions of the basal sliding
   coefficient converge to the exact sliding coefficient as the observation
   error (here, the noise added to synthetic observations) decreases, and
   that a nonlinear rheology makes the reconstruction of the basal sliding
   coefficient more difficult. For the inversion of the rheology exponent
   field, we find that horizontally constant or smoothly varying parameter
   fields can be reconstructed satisfactorily from noisy observations.}},

   critical paths, the proposed method constructs a cumulative distribution
   function (CDF) whose standard deviation represents the root mean square
   (RMS) value of the random jitter of the clock signals used in the
   microprocessor. By leveraging tester period resolution with a frequency
   multiplying phase-locked loop (PLL) in the SoC, the shmoo plot with a
   fine period step size can detect the jitter component in the clock
   signal, which reflects the actual jitter that most critical paths
   undergo. The proposed idea was verified with circuit-level simulations,

Abstract = {{At-speed functional testing has proven to be very effective at
   uncovering defective chips. However for processor testing, generating
   instruction level tests for covering all faults is a challenge given the
   issue of scalability. Data-path faults are relatively easier to control
   and observe compared to control-path faults. In this paper we present a
   novel method to generate instruction level tests for hard to detect
   control-path faults in a processor. We initially map the gate level
   stuck-at fault to the Register Transfer Level (RTL) and build an
   equivalent faulty RTL model. The fault activation and propagation
   constraints are captured using Control and Data Flow Graph of RTL as an
   Liner Temporal Logic (LTL) property. This LTL property is then negated
   and given to a Bounded Model Checker based on a Bit-Vector
   Satisfiability Module Theories (SMT) solver. From the counter-example to
   the property we can extract a sequence of instructions that activates
   the gate level fault and propagates the fault effect to one of the
   observable points in the design. Our approach is completely automatic
   and does not require any external information or manual intervention.
   Experimental results show that our method is robust and scalable for
   generating functional tests for hard to detect faults.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an efficient procedure for prioritizing machine
   changeovers in a semiconductor assembly and test facility on a periodic
   basis. In daily planning, targetmachine-tooling combinations are derived
   based on work-in-process, due dates, and backlogs. As machines finish
   their current lots, they need to be reconfigured to match their target
   setups. The proposed algorithm is designed to achieve this objective and
   run in real time. It first determines which machines are set up
   optimally and for those that are not it sequentially calculates how best
   to reset them within a given amount of time taking into account when the
   necessary tooling will become available, the importance of the lots in
   queue, and the given targets. Alternatively, two mixed-integer
   programming models are also presented that have similar objectives.
   Experimental results using data provided by a leading semiconductor
   manufacturer indicate that high-quality solutions can be obtained with
   the prioritizing procedure in negligible time. In most cases, these
   solutions are identical to those obtained with one of the two
   optimization models.}},

Abstract = {{As the field of engineering design matures, new techniques and methods
   are continuously being developed to conceptualise and analyse product
   architecture. These techniques and methods require product
   representations with higher sophistication, granularity, and fidelity.
   To address these needs, the high-definition design structure matrix
   (HDDSM) is presented as a new and evolved product representation model
   that captures a spectrum of interactions between components of a
   product, such that characteristics of product architecture can be
   assessed and compared. The HDDSM includes an interaction basis to
   capture a variety of standardised types of interactions and a
   hierarchical modelling method to facilitate modular, more efficient
   compilation of a design structure matrix with a high level of detail. To
   illustrate the types of quantitative analyses supported by the HDDSM, it
   is used as a foundation for quantifying the degree of nesting and
   identifying the presence of frameworks in product architectures - two
   characteristics that are related to product customisation.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur-polypyrrole composite cathodes with sulfur contents of 77, 64, to
   53 wt\% have been synthesized by an in-situ deposition of sulfur with
   polypyrrole pre-synthesized by an oxidation method. The presence of
   polypyrrole in the form of nanoparticles prohibits the agglomeration of
   sulfur during the synthesis, resulting in small sulfur particles and
   well-mixed sulfur-polypyrrole composites. The sulfur-polypyrrole
   composite cathodes synthesized have been evaluated by cyclic
   voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling, and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy. The composite cathodes show better electrochemical
   stability, lower overpotential, and better cyclability compared to the
   pristine sulfur as the polypyrrole particles facilitate ion and charge
   transfer within the electrodes. The composites consisting of 64 and 53
   wt\% of sulfur exhibit higher discharge capacities and better
   cyclability than sulfur at C/2, 1 C, and 2 C rates, e. g., retaining
   capacities of > 500 mAh/g at 1 C and similar to 400 mAh/g at 2 C after
   50 cycles. The polypyrrole in the composites improves the
   electrochemical contact within the electrodes as evidenced by the
   reduced charge transfer resistance and improved rate capability as well
   as the porosity of electrodes as revealed by scanning electron
   microscopy. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper presents recent developments and applications of three- (3-D)

   need to be addressed by constructability reviews so as to make projects
   successful by minimizing delays, cost overruns, change orders, and so
   on. The 3-D and 4-D computer-aided drafting (CAD) models are new
   emerging tools that can tremendously aid constructability reviews.
   Although the models are extensively used in building projects for this
   purpose, their use in transportation projects is limited. The 3-D and

   effects on the distribution of trade flows and production. Changes in
   export demands for various commodities highlighted the importance of
   food and petroleum manufacturing sectors in production and
   labor-expenditure shifts. Transport cost reductions had greater effects
   on total production than did similar cost increases. The most affected

Abstract = {{In moving towards an engineered performance-based approach to structural
   fire safety, a sound knowledge of the elevated-temperature properties of
   structural steel is crucial. Of all mechanical properties of structural
   steel at elevated temperatures, material creep is particularly
   important. Under fire conditions, behavior of steel members and
   structures can be highly time-dependent. As a result, understanding the
   time-dependent mechanical properties of structural steel at high
   temperatures becomes essential.
   This paper presents preliminary results of a comprehensive on-going
   research project aimed at characterizing the material creep behavior of
   ASTM A992 steel at elevated temperatures. Such creep properties are
   presented in the form of strain-time curves for materials from the web
   and the flanges of a W4x13 wide flange section and from the web of a
   W30x99 section. The test results are then compared against material
   creep models for structural steel developed by Harmathy, and by Fields
   and Fields to evaluate the predictions of these models. The preliminary
   results clearly indicate that material creep is significant within the
   time, temperature, and stress regimes expected in a builing fire. The
   results also demonstrate the need for a more reliable creep model for
   steel for strcutural-fire engineering analysis.}},

Title = {{Property evaluation of 304L stainless steel fabricated by selective
   laser melting}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{420-428}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Additive manufacturing raw material cost has been recently
   confirmed as a significant obstacle to widespread deployment of these
   technologies in industry. Aiming at reducing the cost of the selective
   laser melting (SLM) process, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate
   the different properties of products fabricated by SLM using low-cost
   (\$10/Kg) feedstock 304L stainless steel powders. The entire process
   cost was also evaluated.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using an experimental approach, 24 samples
   with different shapes and sizes were fabricated with layer thickness of
   30, 50 and 70 mu m and laser scanning speed set at 70 and 90 mm/s. Part
   geometry, dimensional tolerance, surface quality, density, mechanical
   properties and microstructure were evaluated.
   Findings - Results confirmed that the SLM of low-cost 304L powder was
   successful and could produce functional parts with fine details and
   small wall thickness. Using small layer thickness and low scanning speed
   improved the properties by more than 20 per cent. At a layer thickness
   of 30 mu m and speed of 70 mm/s, density was 92 per cent and hardness
   was 190 HV. At layer thickness of 70 mu m porosity increases and cracks
   started to form which decreased strength and ductility. The steel
   remained austenitic with no carbide films at grain boundaries due to the
   high melting and cooling cycles.
   Research limitations/implications - This research was limited to 3041
   powders. Future work should be done on different materials and should
   include the effect of post processing heat treatment on improving the
   mechanical properties and microstructure.
   Practical implications - The cost of the SLM process using feedstock
   powders was less than 10per cent of the cost of using the special
   powders from a machine manufacturer with almost no effect on product
   quality.
   Originality/value - The paper describes how cost reduction in the SLM
   process was achieved by using 304L powder.}},

Title = {{Molecular Dynamics Analysis of PVA-AgnP Composites by Dielectric
   Spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{The molecular dynamics of PVA/AgnP composites were studied by dielectric
   spectroscopy (DS) in the 20-300 degrees C temperature range. Improper
   water elimination leads to misinterpretation of thermal relaxations in
   PVA composites in agreement with the previous report for pristine PVA.
   The evaporation of water and its plasticizing effect are more evident in
   pure PVA confirming the existence of strong interaction between OH
   groups of PVA chains and AgnP. Dry films show a single nonlinear VFT
   dependence (from 45 degrees C until melting) associated to the
   alpha-relaxation and, therefore, to the glass transition phenomenon and
   from dielectric measurements, the T-g of composites vary from 88 degrees
   C for pristine PVA to 125 degrees C for PVA/AgnP (5 wt\%). Below 45
   degrees C, dry films exhibit a single Arrhenius behavior showing a 3D
   hopping conductivity as explained based on the variable range hopping
   model. PVA/AgnP composites have higher conductivity compared to pristine
   PVA, and it increases as AgnP weight percent increases. Finally, DMA
   measurements support the statement that a secondary relaxation was
   erroneously assigned as the glass transition of PVA and composites in
   previous reports.}},

Title = {{Polish Resistance of Fine Aggregates in Portland Cement Concrete
   Pavements}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2267}},
Pages = {{29-36}},
Abstract = {{Many state agencies have limited the use of some sources of fine
   aggregates in portland cement concrete pavements because of possible
   skid issues related to the incorporation of such sands. The Texas
   Department of Transportation, for example, has adopted the
   acid-insoluble residue (AIR) test to identify polish-resistant
   aggregates. Because calcium carbonate is soluble in acid, no carbonate
   sand passes the AIR test, which has a minimum limit of 60\% AIR in
   Texas. This paper describes research that evaluated the polish
   resistance of aggregates with a laboratory concrete performance test.
   Concrete slabs made with different fine aggregates were evaluated for
   skid with the use of a circular track meter, a dynamic friction tester,
   and a three-wheel polishing device. For each concrete slab tested, the
   change in texture and friction was monitored for 160,000 polishing
   cycles. To ensure that the values obtained in the laboratory related to
   field performance, test sections constructed with 100\% limestone sand
   and blended sands were also evaluated. Results show that some aggregates
   that failed the AIR test performed as well as some siliceous fine
   aggregates that passed the AIR test. Other aggregate tests such as the
   fine aggregates micro-Deval have been shown to relate more closely to
   the concrete performance tests performed under laboratory conditions.
   Results obtained from laboratory and field testing showed that blending
   small quantities of siliceous sand with limestone sands considerably
   increased the skid resistance of concrete.}},

   Aggregate-Bitumen Bond Strengths and Asphalt Mixture Durability}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2267}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Abstract = {{The surface free energy of a solid is a material property that
   influences its interaction with other solids, liquids, and gases.
   Mineral aggregates are mixed with bitumen in the production of asphalt
   mixtures, and the interaction of aggregates with bitumen, water, or
   chemical modifiers affects the overall performance of the mixtures and,
   in turn, the pavement structure. A comprehensive characterization of the
   minerals that make up these aggregates can be used to explain the
   interactions between the aggregates and components used to bind the
   aggregates including bitumen, water, and chemical additives. This paper
   combines several techniques to quantify and describe or catalog mineral
   properties. These properties primarily include surface free energy,
   specific surface area, and surface carbon content of some of the most
   common minerals found in aggregates. The paper presents data that
   exemplify how this information can be used to characterize the
   moisture-induced stripping potential for bitumen mineral combinations.
   Results indicate that a simple energy ratio calculated on the basis of
   adhesive bond energies from surface free energy measurements of the
   minerals and the bitumen can predict performance in asphalt mixtures and
   that a few minerals can form thermodynamically stable bonds with some
   bitumens that are inherently resistant to stripping.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses inverse optimization of three dimensional front and
   back surface texture grating specifications, for the purpose of shaping
   the absorptivity spectrum of silicon thin film cells in targeted ways.
   Periodic plasmonic gratings with dimensions comparable or less than the
   incident light wavelength are known to enhance light absorption. We
   consider surface patterning of amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films using
   front and/or back metallic nanostrips and ITO coatings, and show that
   wideband enhancement in unpolarized absorptivity spectrum can be
   achieved when back reflectors are used. The overall short circuit
   current enhancement using such structures is significant and can be as
   high as 97\%. For TM-polarized wave it can be even higher as reported in
   previous work. In this work however, we focus on the optimization for
   the more realistic unpolarized radiation which is of significantly
   higher complexity. In addition, optimization is done with respect to two
   objective functions independently: spectral absorptivity and
   gain-bandwidth product of the absorptivity spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{The k-distribution method for treating the spectral properties of an
   absorbing-emitting medium represents an alternative to line-by-line
   calculations which reduces the number of RTE evaluations from the order
   of a million to the order of ten without any significant loss of
   accuracy. For problems where an appropriate reference temperature can be
   defined, the k-distribution method is formally exact. However, when no
   appropriate reference temperature can be defined, the method results in
   errors. There have been several attempts to implement corrections to the
   k-distribution method to extend its application to inhomogeneous media
   by modelling the effects of temperature, pressure, and concentration
   gradient. Some of these techniques are very effective at reducing these
   errors, but none successfully extend the k-distribution method to
   inhomogeneous media in a way that retains the analytical guarantee of
   line-by-line accuracy. The Multi-Source Full Spectrum K-Distribution
   Method (MSFSK) introduced here manages to attain this goal for
   1-dimensional domains with piecewise constant temperature distributions

Title = {{Emissions of p-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene from consumer products}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{9}},
Abstract = {{p-Dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) and naphthalene are classified as hazardous
   air pollutants and rank highly among chronic chemical hazards in U. S.
   residences. Sources of p-DCB and naphthalene include moth repellents and
   deodorizers typically used in closets, garment bags, and toilet bowls.
   Nearly pure concentrations of p-DCB and naphthalene are found in these
   products. p-DCB and naphthalene mass emission rates were determined for
   four different products placed in well-ventilated laboratory chambers as
   well as closets in a test house and in a garment bag. Concentrations
   were measured in bedrooms adjacent to closets where products were used.
   Emission rates varied considerably between products that contain p-DCB,
   primarily due to product packaging, and were generally suppressed when
   the product was used in closed closet or garments bags relative to
   products placed in well-ventilated chambers. This reduction appears to
   be due to lower air speeds in closets and garment bags as opposed to
   chemical accumulation. Variations in air temperature within typical
   ranges observed in homes can significantly influence emission rates of
   p-DCB and naphthalene. Concentrations of p-DCB and naphthalene in
   bedrooms adjacent to closets where moth repellents are used can exceed
   or approach odor thresholds. For this study, the concentrations exceeded
   or were within the upper few percentiles of those previously reported in
   residential indoor air. Based on a comparison of whole-house emission
   rates derived in a previous study, it appears that somewhere between 2\%
   and 12\% of homes in that study had active sources of p-DCB and between
   5\% and 15\% had active sources of naphthalene.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Abstract = {{Shear stresses are powerful regulators of cellular function and potent
   mediators of the development of vascular disease. We have designed and
   optimized a system allowing the application of flow to cultured cells in
   a multichannel format. By using a multichannel peristaltic pump, flow
   can be driven continuously in the system for long-term studies in
   multiple isolated flow loops. A key component of the system is a
   dual-chamber pulse dampener that removes the pulsatility of the flow
   without the need for having an open system or elevated reservoir. We
   optimized the design parameters of the pulse dampening chambers for the
   maximum reduction in flow pulsation while minimizing the fluid needed
   for each isolated flow channel. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
   (HUVECs) were exposed to steady and pulsatile shear stress using the
   system. We found that cells under steady flow had a marked increased
   production of eNOS and formation of actin stress fibers in comparison to
   those under pulsatile flow conditions. Overall, the results confirm the
   utility of the device as a practical means to apply shear stress to
   cultured cells in the multichannel format and provide steady, long term
   flow to microfluidic devices.}},

Title = {{Characterizing Curvilinear Features Using the Localized Normal-Score
   Ensemble Kalman Filter}},
Journal = {{ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{The localized normal-score ensemble Kalman filter is shown to work for
   the characterization of non-multi-Gaussian distributed hydraulic
   conductivities by assimilating state observation data. The influence of
   type of flow regime, number of observation piezometers, and the prior
   model structure are evaluated in a synthetic aquifer. Steady-state
   observation data are not sufficient to identify the conductivity
   channels. Transient-state data are necessary for a good characterization
   of the hydraulic conductivity curvilinear patterns. Such
   characterization is very good with a dense network of observation data,
   and it deteriorates as the number of observation piezometers decreases.
   It is also remarkable that, even when the prior model structure is
   wrong, the localized normal-score ensemble Kalman filter can produce
   acceptable results for a sufficiently dense observation network.}},

Volume = {{159}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{B554-B563}},
Abstract = {{Studies on the formation and reduction of surface oxide on Pt-Cu/C
   core-shell electrocatalysts have been carried out with reference to the
   nature and type of the adsorbed intermediates formed on the surface as a
   function of applied potential. In-situ measurements were made using EQCM
   coupled with cyclic voltammetry to monitor the surface changes.
   Comparisons between the novel ``core-shell{''} electrocatalysts,
   conventional Pt/C electrocatalysts and unsupported Pt black
   electrocatalysts have been made. We find that interfacial mass of the
   adsorbed species increases in a continuous linear manner as the
   potential is increased during the anodic oxidation. We also find
   evidence to suggest that the oxide formation on the core-shell
   electrocatalyst occurs via the formation of adsorbed hydroxyl species
   involving one electron per surface site and that on pure Pt proceeds via
   adsorbed oxide involving two electrons per site. A different mechanism
   for oxide growth on these catalysts was confirmed by the change in the
   Tafel slopes for anodic oxidation of the surface. The results showed
   that the core-shell catalyst surface is less oxidized and that the
   surface strain imposes a barrier to surface oxidation. This also
   explains the shift in the oxide stripping peak that has been observed
   for the Pt binary alloy catalysts. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

Pages = {{868-893}},
Abstract = {{In a majority of settings, rehabilitative services are provided at
   healthcare facilities by skilled therapists who work as independent
   contractors. Facilities include hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and
   assisted living centers and may be located throughout a wide geographic
   area. To date, the problem of constructing weekly schedules for the
   therapists has yet to be fully investigated. This article presents the
   first algorithm for supporting weekly planning at the agencies that do
   the contracting. The goal is to better match patient demand with
   therapist skills while minimizing treatment, travel, administrative and
   mileage reimbursement costs.
   The problem was modeled as a mixed-integer program but has several
   complicating components, including different patient classes, optional
   weekly treatment patterns and a complex payment structure that
   frustrated the use of exact methods. Alternatively, a parallel
   (two-phase) greedy randomized adaptive search procedure was developed
   that relies on an innovative decomposition scheme and a number of
   benefit measures that explicitly address the trade-off between
   feasibility and solution quality. In Phase I, daily routes are
   constructed for the therapists in parallel and then combined to form
   weekly schedules. In Phase II, a high-level neighborhood search is
   executed to converge towards a local optimum. This is facilitated by
   solving a series of newly formulated traveling salesman problems with
   side constraints. Extensive testing with both real data provided by a U.
   S. rehabilitation agency and associated random instances demonstrates
   the effectiveness of the purposed procedure.}},

Pages = {{8194-8203}},
Abstract = {{The swelling of a polymer gel is a kinetic process coupling mass
   transport and mechanical deformation. Both linear and nonlinear theories
   have been used to describe the swelling kinetics. Here we present a
   comparison between a nonlinear theory for polymer gels and the classical
   theory of linear poroelasticity. We show that the two theories are
   consistent within the linear regime under the condition of small
   perturbation from an isotropically swollen state of the gel. The
   relationship between the material properties in the linear theory and
   those in the nonlinear theory is established by a linearization
   procedure. Both linear and nonlinear solutions are presented for
   swelling kinetics of substrate-constrained and freestanding hydrogel
   layers. Although the linear poroelasticity theory can be used to fit
   experimental data, it is cautioned that the applicability of the linear
   theory should be limited to relatively small swelling ratios. To remove
   the linear limitation, a new procedure is suggested to fit the
   experimental data with the nonlinear theory. Finally, we discuss the
   indentation experiment as an effective method for characterizing the
   mechanical and transport properties of polymer gels along with possible
   extensions of the method.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a numerical multiscale method for coupling a conservation law
   for mass at the continuum scale with a discrete network model that
   describes the microscale flow in a porous medium. In this work we focus
   on coupling pressure equations. Evaluating pressure from a detailed
   network model over a large physical domain is typically computationally
   very expensive. We assume that over the same physical domain there
   exists an effective mass conservation equation at the continuum scale
   which could have been solved efficiently if the equation had been
   explicitly given. Our coupling method uses local simulations on sampled
   microscale domains to evaluate the continuum equation and thus solve for
   the pressure in the full domain. We allow nonlinearity in the network
   model as well as in the mass conservation equation. Convergence of the
   coupling method is analyzed. In the case where classical homogenization
   applies, we prove convergence of the proposed multiscale solutions to
   the homogenized equations. Numerical simulations are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In the last year our Solid Immersion Lloyd's Mirror Interference
   Lithography (SILMIL) system has proved to be a successful tool for
   evanescent interferometric lithography (EIL). The initial goal was to
   use SILMIL in conjunction with the surface plasmon polariton (SPP)
   surface states at the resist-metal interface. Through this resonance, we
   aimed to counter the decay of evanescent images created using EIL. By
   analyzing the theory in greater detail we were able to develop a better
   understanding of the resonance phenomena. In this paper, details of the
   design of SILMIL and how one may utilize it to produce ultra-high
   numerical apertures (NAs) are given, as well as an introduction to the
   resonance phenomena and the mechanism behind it. We introduce a new
   method that requires a gain medium (one that has a negative loss) to
   achieve significant enhancements, and present an effective gain medium
   by using a high-index dielectric on low-index media. We present results
   at lambda = 405 nm using such an effective gain medium and also provide
   a feasible design example at the lithography standard lambda = 193 nm.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of broadband extraordinary optical transmission (EOT)
   through metallic gratings at the plasmonic Brewster angle has recently
   been introduced. It is based on the ultrabroadband impedance matching
   between guided modes supported by ultranarrow slits in a one-dimensional
   (1D) metallic grating and an incident transverse magnetic (TM) wave. The
   overall mechanism results in total transmission through such a
   corrugated plasmonic screen. This concept was first demonstrated in 1D
   metallic gratings and it can also be extended to two-dimensional (2D)
   periodic metallic gratings made by either multiple rectangular or
   cylindrical rods. In this contribution, we review this concept and we
   demonstrate that this phenomenon can be applied to semiconductor
   gratings, whose materials have plasmonic properties at THz frequencies.
   This may open several opportunities to develop low-loss, broadband
   optical metamaterials for energy harvesting and concentrators.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},

Pages = {{767-786}},
Abstract = {{Metamodels, also known as surrogate models, can be used in place of
   computationally expensive simulation models to increase computational
   efficiency for the purposes of design optimization or design space
   exploration. The accuracy of these metamodels varies with the scale and
   complexity of the underlying model. In this article, three metamodelling
   methods are evaluated with respect to their capabilities for modelling
   high-dimensional, nonlinear, multimodal functions. Methods analyzed
   include kriging, radial basis functions, and support vector regression.
   Each metamodelling technique is used to model a set of single output
   functions with dimensionality ranging from fifteen to fifty independent
   variables and modality ranging from one to ten local maxima. The number
   of points used to train the models is increased until a predetermined
   error threshold is met. Results show that kriging metamodels perform
   most consistently across a variety of functions, although radial basis
   functions and support vector regression are very competitive for highly
   multimodal functions and functions with large local gradients,
   respectively. Support vector regression metamodels consistently offer
   the shortest build and prediction times when applied to large scale
   multimodal problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the ongoing research efforts to develop a novel
   class of low-cost, unpowered, wireless sensors for detecting corrosion
   of reinforcement in concrete structures. The sensors are powered through
   magnetic coupling between an external reader coil and an embedded
   sensor. Measured AC impedance is used to interpret the state of the
   embedded sensor. The sensors are envisioned to be placed during
   construction and interrogated as part of routine inspections.
   The sensor prototype incorporates a sacrificial corroding element that
   is placed entirely outside the sensor components and interacts with the
   resonant circuit by inductive coupling and shielding of the magnetic
   fields. As the resistance of the sacrificial element increases due to
   corrosion, the measured frequency response changes gradually indicating
   corrosion initiation within concrete. In this paper the potential for
   detecting multiple levels of corrosion damage is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{A reconfigurable and portable wireless reader has been designed for
   embedded passive Electronic Structural Surveillance (ESS) sensors, used
   to monitor corrosion in infrastructure systems. The passive ESS sensors
   have been developed and proven effective in monitoring localized defects
   in their environment. They are interrogated by inductively coupled
   magnetic field of a reader coil. The input impedance of the reader coil
   is monitored to determine whether a corrosion threshold has been
   reached. We have previously used an impedance analyzer to obtain the
   impedance data. Such systems have good sensitivity and moderate speed
   but are bulky and heavy. The new reader approach presented in this paper
   is designed addressing the need of portability, sensitivity and read
   range. The reader electronics is implemented on a reconfigurable
   National Instruments (NI) modular transceiver platform, capable of
   software defined radio. The design employs a reflectometer, which is
   implemented using a 3-port directional coupler and a single coil as both
   the driver and reader, along with the transceiver. The NI transceiver is
   used to generate a swept frequency input signal and analyze reflected
   signal from the reader, which is related to the input impedance of our
   ESS sensor. The configuration of the reader coil is optimized for reader
   range and sensitivity. We have acquired analog data using this design,
   showing that the real-time reader system facilitates especially fast
   detection and long read ranges for threshold-only sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Combined intravascular photoacoustic (IVPA) and intravascular ultrasound
   (IVUS) imaging has been previously established as a viable means for
   imaging atherosclerotic plaques using both endogenous and exogenous
   contrast. In this study, IVUS/IVPA imaging of an atherosclerotic rabbit
   aorta following injection of gold nanorods (AuNR) with peak absorbance
   within the tissue optical window was performed. Ex-vivo imaging results
   revealed high photoacoustic signal from localized AuNR. Corresponding
   histological cross-sections and digital photographs of the arterial
   lumen confirmed the presence of AuNR preferentially located at
   atherosclerotic regions and in agreement with IVPA signal. Furthermore,
   an integrated IVUS/IVPA imaging catheter was used to image the AuNR in
   the presence of luminal blood. The results suggest that AuNR allow for
   IVPA imaging of exogenously labeled atherosclerotic plaques with a
   comparatively low background signal and without the need for arterial
   blood flushing.}},

Abstract = {{In classical clustering, each data point is assigned to at least one
   cluster. However, in many applications only a small subset of the
   available data is relevant for the problem and the rest needs to be
   ignored in order to obtain good clusters. Certain non-parametric
   density-based clustering methods find the most relevant data as multiple
   dense regions, but such methods are generally limited to low-dimensional
   data and do not scale well to large, high-dimensional datasets. Also,
   they use a specific notion of ``distance{''}, typically Euclidean or
   Mahalanobis distance, which further limits their applicability. On the
   other hand, the recent One Class Information Bottleneck (OC-IB) method
   is fast and works on a large class of distortion measures known as
   Bregman Divergences, but can only find a single dense region. This paper
   presents a broad framework for finding k dense clusters while ignoring
   the rest of the data. It includes a seeding algorithm that can
   automatically determine a suitable value for k. When k is forced to 1,
   our method gives rise to an improved version of OC-IB with optimality
   guarantees. We provide a generative model that yields the proposed
   iterative algorithm for finding k dense regions as a special case. Our
   analysis reveals an interesting and novel connection between the problem
   of finding dense regions and exponential mixture models; a hard model
   corresponding to k exponential mixtures with a. uniform background
   results in a set of k dense clusters. The proposed method describes a
   highly scalable algorithm for finding multiple dense regions that works
   with any Bregman Divergence, thus extending density based clustering to
   a variety of non-euclidean problems not addressable by earlier methods.
   We present empirical results on three artificial, two microarray and one
   text dataset to show the relevance and effectiveness of our methods.}},

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{We propose a novel external force for active contours, which we call
   neighborhood-extending and noise-smoothing gradient vector flow (NNGVF).
   The proposed NNGVF snake expresses the gradient vector flow (GVF) as a
   convolution with a neighborhood-extending Laplacian operator augmented
   by a noise-smoothing mask. We find that the NNGVF snake provides better
   segmentation than the GVF snake in terms of noise resistance, weak edge
   preservation, and an enlarged capture range. The NNGVF snake
   accomplishes this with a reduced computational cost while maintaining
   other desirable properties of the GVF snake, such as initialization
   insensitivity and good convergences at concavities. We demonstrate the
   advantages of NNGVF on synthetic and real images.}},

Abstract = {{While Q similar to 1million has been demonstrated in freely suspended
   photonic crystal (PC) membranes, the reduced refractive index contrast
   when PC microcavities are immersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), a
   typical ambient for biomolecules, reduces Q by more than 2 orders of
   magnitude. We experimentally demonstrate photonic crystal microcavity
   based resonant sensors coupled to photonic crystal waveguides in silicon
   on insulator for chemical and bio-sensing. Linear L-type microcavities
   are considered. In contrast to cavities with small modes volumes but low
   quality factors for bio-sensing, we show that increasing the length of
   the microcavity enhances the quality factor of the resonance by an order
   of magnitude and also increases the resonance wavelength shift while
   still retaining compact device characteristics. Q similar to 26,760 and
   sensitivity down to 7.5ng/ml and similar to 9pg/mm(2) in bio-sensing was
   experimentally demonstrated in SOI devices for goat anti-rabbit IgG
   antibodies with K-d similar to 10(-6)M. The increase in cavity length
   follows from fundamental engineering limitations in ink-jet printing or
   microfluidic channels when unique receptor biomolecules are coated on
   separate adjacent sensors in a microarray.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to assess if stereoscopic viewing of breast
   tomosynthesis projection images impacted mass detection performance when

   Hologic, Inc., contained 47 craniocaudal cases (23 biopsy proven
   malignant masses and 24 normals). Two projection images that were
   separated by 8 degrees were chosen to form a stereoscopic pair. The
   images were preprocessed to enhance their contrast and were presented on
   a stereoscopic display. Three experienced breast imagers participated in
   a blinded observer study as readers. Each case was shown twice to each
   reader - once in the stereoscopic mode, and once in the monoscopic mode
   in a random order. The readers were asked to make a binary decision on
   whether they saw a mass for which they would initiate a diagnostic
   workup or not, and also report the location of the mass and provide a
   confidence score in the range of 0-100. The binary decisions were
   analyzed using the sensitivity-specificity measure, while the confidence
   scores were analyzed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
   (ROC). We also report a statistical analysis of the difference in

Journal = {{HEAT TRANSFER ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{947-956}},
Abstract = {{The emerging production of ultrathin graphite material is applied to
   thermal management in a numerical comparison of aluminum and
   graphite-based plate-fin heat exchangers. Considering anisotropic
   thermal conductivity in which out-of-plane transport is about two orders
   of magnitude lower than in-plane values, the ultrathin graphite-based
   solution outperforms aluminum by rejecting up to 20\% more heat on a
   volumetric basis. Thermal and hydraulic performance is characterized for
   both solutions over a range of airflow rates in a notional water/air
   device. Laminar through fully turbulent regimes are considered. Steady
   and unsteady three-dimensional (3-D) conjugate simulations reveal a
   faster equilibration rate for the ultrathin graphite-based solution,
   minimizing thermal lag that must be accounted for in on-demand
   electronics cooling. Fin optimization studies predict equivalent
   conductance with graphite at one-tenth the thickness of aluminum. The
   combination of improved heat rejection, rapid response rate, and low
   material density make an ultrathin graphite-based solution uniquely
   suited to aerospace thermal management.}},

Abstract = {{In unconsolidated sediments, capillary pressure in the pore space may be
   large enough to move grains apart during drainage. This motion alters
   the pore throat sizes which control subsequent displacement in the
   sediment. We present two grain scale models for this coupled process. In
   both cases, we assume fluid interfaces are controlled by capillary
   forces, and determine the detailed geometry of those interfaces. We
   compute the net force exerted on each grain by capillary pressure,
   including cohesion at grain contacts supporting pendular rings. We
   combine those forces to determine the movement of grains using
   a a kinematic model
   b a rigorous model where mechanical stress and elastic properties of
   grains are included via a discrete element method.
   This is the first coupling in 3D, albeit in samples of limited size.
   Preliminary results in disordered dense sphere packs suggest the
   development of high permeability gas channels rather than planar

Title = {{Design, fabrication, and evaluation of negative stiffness elements using
   SLS}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{194-200}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Recent research has shown that constrained bistable structures
   can display negative stiffness behavior and provide extremal vibrational
   and acoustical absorptive capacity. These bistable structures are
   therefore compelling candidates for constructing new meta-materials for
   noise reduction, anechoic coatings, and backing materials for broadband
   imaging transducers. To date, demonstrations of these capabilities have
   been primarily theoretical because the geometry of bistable elements is
   difficult to construct and refine with conventional manufacturing
   methods and materials. The purpose of this paper is to leverage the
   geometric design freedoms provided by selective laser sintering (SLS)
   technology to design and construct constrained bistable structures with
   negative stiffness behavior.
   Design/methodology/approach - A meso-scale negative stiffness system is
   designed and fabricated with SLS technology. The system includes a
   bistable structure in the form of a pre-compressed/pre-buckled beam. The
   dynamic transmissibility of the system is measured, and its behavior is
   compared to the predictions of analytical models.
   Findings - Experimental results demonstrate that pre-compression and
   pre-buckling can be used to induce negative stiffness behavior and
   thereby increase the damping and shift the resonant frequency of an
   unconstrained beam.
   Originality/value - The results support the usefulness of SLS and other
   additive manufacturing technologies for acoustic and dynamic
   applications. Specifically, the demonstrated advantages of SLS include
   the ability to rapidly redesign, functionally 2 prototype, and tune
   physical models for acoustic and dynamic experimentation. Of significant
   importance is the ability of SLS to enable consolidation of parts that
   are traditionally separate, thereby reducing vibrational noise in these
   systems. In this specific application, SLS enables a proof-of-concept
   comparison of the theoretical and experimental behavior of a meso-scale
   negative stiffness system. The demonstrated acoustical and vibrational
   absorptive capacity of these systems is expected to lead to designs for
   new structures and materials that offer significantly improved energy
   absorbing capabilities over a broad range of tunable frequencies without
   compromising structural stiffness.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A Cu6Sn5-TiC-C nanocomposite alloy anode has been synthesized by first
   firing a mixture of Cu, Sn, and Ti metals and then ball milling the
   resultant material with carbon. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy
   (STEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveal that these
   nanocomposites are composed of nanostructured Cu6Sn5 particles in a
   matrix of TiC and conductive carbon. The presence of TiC and conductive
   carbon improves the cycle life of Cu6Sn5 anodes compared to that found
   with plain Cu6Sn5. With a second cycle discharge capacity of 1340 mAh
   cm(-3) (610 mAh g(-1)) and a tap density of 2.2 g cm(-3), the
   Cu6Sn5-TiC-C nanocomposite anode offers a volumetric capacity that is at
   least four times higher than that of the graphite anode and 30\% higher
   than what can be achieved with silicon. A conductive Cu framework
   supports the electrochemically-active Sn particles, resulting in low
   impedance and good rate capability. TEM data from electrodes that were
   cycled between 0 and 200 cycles show that the Cu6Sn5 particles do not
   agglomerate, and the morphology of the particles does not change during
   extended cycling. Furthermore, this nanocomposite anode material
   exhibits excellent performance in full cells with manganese-containing
   cathodes at elevated temperatures, indicating that it may not be
   poisoned by dissolved Mn.}},

Abstract = {{We use computer simulations to study the phase separation behavior of
   amphiphilic linear gradient copolymer solution under poor solvent
   conditions. Using the bond fluctuation model and parallel tempering
   algorithm, we explore the influence of the gradient strength (the
   largest difference in the instantaneous composition along the copolymer)
   upon the phase separation characteristics. Under poor solvent
   conditions, the chains collapse to form micelle-like aggregates. We find
   that the critical temperature for this transition exhibits a linear
   dependence on the gradient strength of the copolymers. A systematic
   quantification of the cluster characteristics formed during the phase
   separation also reveals a strong dependence of aggregation numbers and
   the bridging statistics upon the gradient strength of the copolymers.
   Analysis of our results reveals that the critical parameter determining
   the thermodynamic behavior of gradient copolymers is in fact the average
   length of the hydrophobic sequences in the gradient copolymers. We
   demonstrate that the latter provides a useful measure to quantitatively
   predict the critical transition temperature of the gradient copolymer
   solution. We also present a few results from the framework of an
   annealed representation of the sequences of the gradient copolymer to
   demonstrate the limitations arising from such a model representation.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of water confined on nanometer length scales is important
   in a diverse set of technical and scientific contexts, ranging from the
   performance of fuel cells and biological molecular machines to the
   design of self-assembling nanoscale materials. Here, we review recent
   insights into the structure and thermodynamics of confined water that
   have been elucidated primarily by computer simulation studies. We
   emphasize investigations in which interfacial chemistry and molecular
   topography are varied systematically and in which a wide range of
   thermodynamic conditions of temperature and pressure are explored. We
   consider homogeneous interfaces ranging from the simplest hard wall to
   chemically realistic, but structurally ideal, hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic surfaces, and the continuous scale of surface polarity is
   investigated. Features associated with interface heterogeneities arising
   from chemical patterning or from the natural characteristics of protein
   surfaces are discussed. Finally, we provide our thoughts on important
   directions for further studies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{11550-11555}},
Abstract = {{Planar defects in lithium-rich layered oxides were examined by
   aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to
   understand their formation. Planar defects were found to form during the
   transition of the transition metal layer from a disordered R (3) over
   barm state to a lithium-ordered C2/m state. This disorder-to-order
   transition resulted in three orientation variants, namely {[}100],
   {[}110], and {[}1 (1) over bar0]. The fundamental mechanism behind the
   observed defects is a shear of +/-b/3{[}010] on the (001) transition
   metal planes, which is equivalent to the point group operations lost
   during the disorder-to-order transition. These displacements also
   produced twins and single unit cells with P3(1)12 symmetry. Lithium-rich
   layered oxides with and without nickel show the presence of these three
   orientation variants.}},

Abstract = {{Jet-and-Flash Imprint Lithography (J-FIL) has demonstrated capability of
   high-resolution patterning at low costs. For accurate pattern transfer
   using J-FIL, it is necessary to have control of the residual layer
   thickness (RLT) of cured resist underneath features. Variation in RLT
   leads to critical dimension variation, thereby degrading device
   performance. Substrate nanotopography and feature density variation are
   two unavoidable sources of variation in RLT uniformity. The first part
   of this paper demonstrates the effect of these parameters on RLT
   variation. Through experiments and modeling, it has been observed that
   flatter wafers with lower nanotopography and thinner RLT lead to better
   RLT uniformity. However, for studying RLT variation, accurate metrology
   is critical. Currently, all metrology is done using destructive
   cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which may not be
   sufficient for process control. To this end, nondestructive optics-based
   methods, including the Through-focus Scanning Optical Microscopy (TSOM)
   method have been explored in this paper. Simulations reveal the
   potential to measure mean RLT, RLT variation, and uncertainty in feature
   dimension to an accuracy of 1 nm. Experimental validation and
   calibration are works in progress. Subsequent development of this
   technique can lead to a viable in-line metrology solution for RLT
   underneath features.}},

Abstract = {{A passive, wireless sensor has been developed at the University of Texas
   at Austin to monitor the insitu conductivity of concrete within civil
   infrastructure systems. Electrical conductivity is one possible
   indicator of corrosion of embedded reinforcement and thereby provides
   information on structural performance. The sensors would be attached to
   the reinforcement cages before placement of the concrete and
   interrogated as part of a routine inspection over the service life. A
   new sensor design, a non-contact conductivity sensor, is being developed
   to minimize the likelihood of damage to the sensor during placement of
   the concrete; a metal element is positioned above the sensor body but is
   not connected to the resonant circuit within the sensor. In order to
   verify the response of the non-contact conductivity sensors, they were
   submerged in liquids of increasing conductivity. Analysis of the
   measured data demonstrated that the noncontact conductivity sensors
   successfully detected conductivity variations in liquids.}},

Abstract = {{Li-ion battery anodes made of SnO2 nanoparticles and a TiO2-supported

   anode and the SnO2/TiO2-based anode show improved cycling stability.
   Compared to the SnO2 nanoparticle based anodes, the TiO2-support-SnO2
   nanocomposite anodes exhibit better cyclability and higher Coulombic
   efficiency. During the first lithiation process, Li+ conducting LixTiO2
   is formed in the SnO2/TiO2 composite, which structurally/mechanically
   supports the electrode. The anode made of amorphous TiO2-cassiterite
   SnO2 retained a reversible capacity of similar to 500 mAh g(-1) (based

Abstract = {{A membrane of a dielectric elastomer deforms when a voltage is applied
   through its thickness. The achievable voltage-induced deformation is
   strongly affected by how mechanical loads are applied. Large
   voltage-induced deformation has been demonstrated for a membrane under
   equal-biaxial forces, but only small voltage-induced deformation has
   been observed for a membrane under a uniaxial force. This difference is
   interpreted here theoretically. The theory also predicts that, when the
   deformation of a membrane is constrained in one direction, a voltage
   applied through the thickness of the membrane can cause it to deform
   substantially in the other direction. Experiments are performed on
   membranes under equal-biaxial forces and uniaxial forces, as well as on
   fiber-constrained membranes of two types: a dielectric elastomer
   membrane with carbon fibers on both faces, and two dielectric elastomer
   membranes sandwiching nylon fibers. The experimental observations are
   compared with the theory.}},

Abstract = {{The desire to extend the service life of structures made with reinforced
   concrete has led to increased efforts to find alternative reinforcement
   materials to ordinary carbon steel. These alternatives may be in the
   form of coated steel or inherently more corrosion resistant alloys such
   as solid stainless or stainless-clad steel.
   This paper describes an investigation in which concrete specimens
   containing alternative reinforcement materials were intermittently
   exposed to chloride-containing environments. The specimens were made in
   accordance with a modified version of ASTM G 109 and exposed for more
   than eight years. One group was exposed in the laboratory, and the other
   at a beach site at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. They were
   examined based on current generated between top and bottom reinforcement
   as well as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The results of
   this investigation will be discussed in terms of their significance on
   the anticipated long-term behavior of alternative reinforcement
   materials.}},

   Attention is focused on the Casimir limit in phonon boundary scattering
   and the effect of phonon confinement on the lattice thermal conductivity
   of semiconductor nanowires (NWs) and nanomeshes; the effects of
   thickness, lateral size, and interface interaction on the lattice
   thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene; and the
   phonon-drag thermopower and quantum size effects on the thermoelectric
   power factor in semiconductor NWs. Further experimental and theoretical
   investigations are suggested for better understanding of some of these

Abstract = {{In this article, we discuss an application of a fictitious domain method
   to the numerical simulation of the mechanical process induced by
   press-fitting cementless femoral implants in total hip replacement
   surgeries. Here, the primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of
   the method and its advantages over competing numerical methods for a
   wide range of applications for which the primary input originates from
   computed tomography-, magnetic resonance imaging- or other regular-grid
   medical imaging data. For this class of problems, the fictitious domain
   method is a natural choice, because it avoids the segmentation, surface
   reconstruction and meshing phases required by unstructured
   geometry-conforming simulation methods. We consider the implantation of
   a press-fit femoral artificial prosthesis as a prototype problem for
   sketching the application path of the methodology. Of concern is the
   assessment of the robustness and speed of the methodology, for both
   factors are critical if one were to consider patient-specific modelling.
   To this end, we report numerical results that exhibit optimal
   convergence rates and thus shed a favourable light on the approach.}},

Abstract = {{With the technology trend of using optical interconnects as an
   alternative to traditional copper interconnects, basic elements such as
   waveguides and waveguide bus structure are studied worldwide. A novel
   3-node bi-directional 50 mu m optical waveguide bus architecture with
   embedded mirrors is proposed and fabricated on flexible substrate. The
   fabrication is achieved by lithography-free molding. Different from
   other replicating methods, the mold demonstrated here is a nickel metal
   mold achieved by low cost electroplating and can be used repeatedly. The
   data transmission test up to 10Gbps using vertical cavity surface
   emitting laser (VCSEL) has been performed to evaluate the device. The
   results show that the device is capable of emitting and receiving high
   speed data. Thus it can serve as a high performance optical backplane.
   Such mold fabrication technology can also be applied to smaller features
   size structure. The molds of 5 mu m wide waveguides and photonic crystal
   waveguide structures with 250nm hole size are fabricated and the molded
   structure profiles are shown.}},

   seeded with either progenitor or differentiated cells that substitute
   for tissue or organs. Paracrine factors or other drugs are incorporated
   into these scaffolds to promote tissue regeneration and function.
   Precise control of both timing and presentation of these drugs is
   necessary for sufficient efficacy. This chapter provides an overview of
   the common biomaterials and drugs encountered in bone, cartilage,
   neural, and cardiovascular tissue engineering, as well as current
   strategies and future directions for drug delivery in tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The benchmarking of engineering productivity can assist in the
   identification of inefficiencies and thus can be critical to cost
   control. Recognizing the importance of engineering productivity
   measurement, the Construction Industry Institute (CII) developed the
   Engineering Productivity Metric System (EPMS) composed of a series of
   hierarchical metrics with standard definitions suitable for measuring
   engineering productivity at various levels. While the EPMS can be used
   to assess engineering productivity at multiple levels within a
   discipline, it cannot produce an overall project level productivity
   measurement due to the underlying method of defining productivity.
   Previous studies have attempted to develop other metrics to assess
   engineering productivity at the project level; however, these methods
   did not create metrics suitable for benchmarking. To overcome these
   limitations, this study developed a standardization approach using
   ``z-scores{''} to aggregate engineering productivity measurement from
   actual data collected from 112 projects provided by CII member
   companies. This method produces a metric with a project level view of
   engineering productivity. It allows owners and engineering firms to
   summarize engineering productivity at both the discipline level and at
   the project level. The method illustrates a comprehensive and innovative
   procedure to develop a metric for summary of productivity metrics with
   different underlying outputs, thus laying the foundation for future
   analyses and studies.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of stent surface-scattering properties on the appearance of stent
   struts in IV-OCT images was examined by simulation of light-stent
   interaction by an optical design software package. A phantom blood
   vessel was constructed from a mix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and
   titanium dioxide to simulate the elastic and optical scattering
   properties of the arterial wall. A Cordis CYPHER (R) sirolimus-eluting
   stent was deployed within the phantom vessel and high resolution
   Micro-CT images of the stent strut were recorded to create a
   three-dimensional representation that was imported into software. A
   Gaussian surface-scattering model (bi-directional scattering
   distribution function) was assumed for the strut. Simulation of IV-OCT
   catheter and reflection of light from the stent strut was implemented
   for different surface scattering properties. A model of IV-OCT catheter
   was defined in the optical model and the rotation of the light beam over
   the stent strut was simulated. The measured parameters included:
   fraction of the reflected rays returning to the catheter and coordinate
   locations on the stent struts of returned rays. The results indicate
   that when the surface scattering of the strut increases, reflectivity is
   higher, while the angular spread of the light beam that is reflected
   back to the catheter is wider.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) during neurosurgery can provide
   important physiological information for a variety of surgical
   procedures. Although multiple intraoperative vascular monitoring
   technologies are currently available, a quantitative method that allows
   for continuous monitoring is still needed. Laser speckle contrast
   imaging (LSCI) is an optical imaging method with high spatial and
   temporal resolution that has been widely used to image CBF in animal
   models in vivo. In this pilot clinical study, we adapted a Zeiss OPMI
   Pentero neurosurgical microscope to obtain LSCI images by attaching a
   camera and a laser diode. This LSCI adapted instrument has been used to
   acquire full field flow images from 10 patients during tumor resection
   procedures. The patient's ECG was recorded during acquisition and image
   registration was performed in post-processing to account for pulsatile
   motion artifacts. Digital photographs confirmed alignment of vasculature
   and flow images in four cases, and a relative change in blood flow was
   observed in two patients after bipolar cautery. The LSCI adapted
   instrument has the capability to produce real-time, full field CBF image
   maps with excellent spatial resolution and minimal intervention to the
   surgical procedure. Results from this study demonstrate the feasibility
   of using LSCI to monitor blood flow during neurosurgery.}},

   show much larger deviations from Gaussian fluctuations for low or zero
   occupancies relative to more compressible fluids with more open
   networks. Water appears to be a unique molecular fluid in possessing
   equilibrium density fluctuations that are faithfully described by the
   Gaussian theory. We ascribe this success to the fact, shown here, that
   the orientational correlations near a small hard sphere solute involve
   remarkably little reorganization from the bulk, which is a consequence
   of water's low solvent reorganization enthalpy and entropy.}},

Abstract = {{Porous, nanostructured BiVO4 films are incorporated with Mo and W by
   simultaneous evaporation of Bi, V, Mo, and W in vacuum followed by
   oxidation in air. Synthesis parameters such as the Bi : V: Mo : W atomic
   ratio and deposition angle are adjusted to optimize the films for
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. Films synthesized with a Bi
   : V: Mo: W atomic ratio of 46 : 46 : 6 : 2 (6\% Mo, 2\% W) demonstrate
   the best PEC performance with photocurrent densities 10 times higher
   than for pure BiVO4 and greater than previously reported for Mo and W
   containing BiVO4. The films consist of a directional, nanocolumnar layer
   beneath an irregular surface structure. Backside illumination utilizes
   light scattering off the irregular surface structure resulting in
   30-45\% higher photocurrent densities than for frontside illumination.
   To improve the kinetics for water oxidation Pt is photo-deposited onto
   the surface of the 6\% Mo, 2\% W BiVO4 films as an electrocatalyst.
   These films achieve quantum efficiencies of 37\% at 1.1 V vs. RHE and

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {{77-95}},
Abstract = {{In contrast to discrete descriptions of fracture, phase-field
   descriptions do not require numerical tracking of discontinuities in the
   displacement field. This greatly reduces implementation complexity. In
   this work, we extend a phase-field model for quasi-static brittle
   fracture to the dynamic case. We introduce a phase-field approximation
   to the Lagrangian for discrete fracture problems and derive the coupled
   system of equations that govern the motion of the body and evolution of
   the phase-field. We study the behavior of the model in one dimension and
   show how it influences material properties. For the temporal
   discretization of the equations of motion, we present both a monolithic
   and staggered time integration scheme. We study the behavior of the
   dynamic model by performing a number of two and three dimensional
   numerical experiments. We also introduce a local adaptive refinement
   strategy and study its performance in the context of locally refined
   T-splines. We show that the combination of the phase-field model and
   local adaptive refinement provides an effective method for simulating
   fracture in three dimensions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Large geophysical flows often encompass both coarse and highly resolved
   regions. Approximating these flows using shock-capturing methods with
   explicit time stepping gives rise to a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
   time step constraint. Even if the refined regions are sparse, they can
   restrict the global CFL condition to very small time steps, vastly
   increasing computational effort over the whole domain. One method to
   cope with this problem is to use locally varying time steps over the
   domain. These are also referred to as multi-rate methods in the ODE
   literature. Ideally, such methods must be conservative, accurate and
   easy to implement. In this study, we derive a second-order, local time
   stepping procedure within a Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG)
   framework to solve the shallow water equations. This procedure is based
   on previous first-order work of the second author and collaborator Kirby
   {[}1-3]. As we are interested in both coastal and overland flows due to,
   e.g., rainfall, wetting and drying is incorporated into the model.
   Numerical results are shown, which verify the accuracy and efficiency of
   the approach (compared to using a globally defined CFL time step), and
   the application of the method to rainfall-runoff scenarios. Published by
   Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A digital micromirror device (DMD) laser beam shaper was implemented for
   projecting spatial bandwidth-limited laser images with precisely
   controlled intensity. A telescope images the binary DMD pattern with an
   adjustable pinhole low-pass filter that controls the system bandwidth
   and converts the binary pixelated image back to grayscale. Images with
   arbitrary but bandwidth-limited spatial frequency content are formed.
   System performance was evaluated by examining the spatial frequency
   response in terms of RMS intensity error by generating
   sinusoidal-flattop beam profiles with different spatial periods. This
   system evaluation was used as a reference to predict the error level of
   arbitrary output beam profiles.
   In addition, we demonstrated band-limited laser image projection for
   different spatial bandwidths using a grayscale image superimposed on a
   flattop laser beam profile. Optimized system bandwidth was simulated by
   considering the tradeoff between image precision and spatial resolution.
   Experimental results demonstrated that the RMS error of output beam
   profiles was consistent with the system evaluation reference. The major
   residual error in the output beam profile came from the sharp-edged
   pinhole low-pass filter. Error histograms had a Gaussian distribution
   with mean value of zero and standard deviation equal to the value of the
   RMS error. We plan to apply this technique to generate programmable
   optical trap shapes in ultracold atom experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new optical technique to suppress the unwanted zero-order
   diffraction (ZOD) in holograms produced by the digital micromirror
   device (DMD). The proposed optical architecture consists of two light
   beams illuminating the DMD in an interferometer configuration. The two
   beams are incident from different angles, +24 degrees and -24 degrees,
   in order to utilize light diffracted from all the pixels to produce a
   binary Fresnel hologram. The relation between these two beams
   diffracting from the DMD was found to be complementary, and they both
   generated the same reconstructed image pattern. With pi phase difference
   between the two beams, the diffracted beams had their ZOD components out
   of phase while the reconstructed holograms were identical and in phase.
   Experiments were conducted to demonstrate ZOD suppression by destructive
   interference and simultaneous hologram enhancement by constructive
   interference. The method was shown to suppress the ZOD by a factor of
   2.9 in a Fresnel hologram.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic simulations are becoming increasingly important in numerous
   engineering applications. The solution to the governing equations are
   complicated due to the high-dimensional spaces and the presence of
   randomness. In this paper we present libMoM
   (http://libmom.sourceforge.net), a software library to solve various
   types of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) as well as estimate
   statistical distributions from the moments. The library provides a suite
   of tools to solve various SDEs using the method of moments (MoM) as well
   as estimate statistical distributions from the moments using moment
   matching algorithms. For a large class of problems, MoM provide
   efficient solutions compared with other stochastic simulation techniques
   such as Monte Carlo (MC). In the physical sciences, the moments of the
   distribution are usually the primary quantities of interest. The library
   enables the solution of moment equations derived from a variety of SDEs,
   with closure using non-standard Gaussian quadrature. In engineering risk
   assessment and decision making, statistical distributions are required.
   The library implements tools for fitting the Generalized Lambda
   Distribution (GLD) with the given moments. The objectives of this paper
   are (1) to briefly outline the theory behind moment methods for solving
   SDEs/estimation of statistical distributions; (2) describe the
   organization of the software and user interfaces; (3) discuss use of
   standard software engineering tools for regression testing, aid
   collaboration, distribution and further development. A number of
   representative examples of the use of libMoM in various engineering
   applications are presented and future areas of research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the use of phase stabilized swept source
   optical coherence tomography (PhS-SSOCT) for the measurement of surface
   mechanical wave propagation in ocular tissue in-situ. Mechanical wave
   propagation was measured in the mouse cornea for both young and older
   mice to assess tissue properties as a function of age. The measurements
   were performed by inducing low amplitude (< 100 mu m) waves and
   measuring the wave attenuation at spatially distributed points using a
   phase-sensitive analysis of OCT signals. Obtained results indicate that
   the attenuation of the wave amplitude was 0.27 mu m/mm in the one
   month-old mouse cornea and 0.37 mu m/mm for 9 month old mice (and
   presumably of different stiffness for 1 month and 9 months old). Results
   also suggest that PhS-SSOCT is capable of measuring the changes in the
   wave amplitude as small as 0.03 mu m (limited by the phase stability of
   the system) that allowed the measurements with a very low amplitude
   excitation wave, thus making the method minimally invasive. Therefore,
   this method could potentially be used to assess tissue biomechanical
   properties and to reconstruct stiffness maps of the cornea.}},

Title = {{In vivo tumor targeting of gold nanoparticles: effect of particle type
   and dosing strategy}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{1251-1258}},
Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have gained significant interest as
   nanovectors for combined imaging and photothermal therapy of tumors.
   Delivered systemically, GNPs preferentially accumulate at the tumor site
   via the enhanced permeability and retention effect, and when irradiated
   with near infrared light, produce sufficient heat to treat tumor tissue.
   The efficacy of this process strongly depends on the targeting ability
   of the GNPs, which is a function of the particle's geometric properties
   (eg, size) and dosing strategy (eg, number and amount of injections).
   The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of GNP type and
   dosing strategy on in vivo tumor targeting. Specifically, we
   investigated the in vivo tumor-targeting efficiency of pegylated gold
   nanoshells (GNSs) and gold nanorods (GNRs) for single and multiple
   dosing. We used Swiss nu/nu mice with a subcutaneous tumor xenograft
   model that received intravenous administration for a single and multiple
   doses of GNS and GNR. We performed neutron activation analysis to
   quantify the gold present in the tumor and liver. We performed histology
   to determine if there was acute toxicity as a result of multiple dosing.
   Neutron activation analysis results showed that the smaller GNRs
   accumulated in higher concentrations in the tumor compared to the larger
   GNSs. We observed a significant increase in GNS and GNR accumulation in
   the liver for higher doses. However, multiple doses increased targeting
   efficiency with minimal effect beyond three doses of GNPs. These results
   suggest a significant effect of particle type and multiple doses on
   increasing particle accumulation and on tumor targeting ability.}},

Abstract = {{We report design and construction of an FPGA-based high-speed
   swept-source polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography
   (SS-PS-OCT) system for clinical retinal imaging. Clinical application of
   the SS-PS-OCT system is accurate measurement and display of thickness,
   phase retardation and birefringence maps of the retinal nerve fiber
   layer (RNFL) in human subjects for early detection of glaucoma. The
   FPGA-based SS-PS-OCT system provides three incident polarization states
   on the eye and uses a bulk-optic polarization sensitive balanced
   detection module to record two orthogonal interference fringe signals.
   Interference fringe signals and relative phase retardation between two
   orthogonal polarization states are used to obtain Stokes vectors of
   light returning from each RNFL depth. We implement a Levenberg-Marquardt
   algorithm on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to compute accurate
   phase retardation and birefringence maps. For each retinal scan, a
   three-state Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear algorithm is applied to 360
   clusters each consisting of 100 A-scans to determine accurate maps of
   phase retardation and birefringence in less than 1 second after patient
   measurement allowing real-time clinical imaging-a speedup of more than
   300 times over previous implementations. We report application of the
   FPGA-based SS-PS-OCT system for real-time clinical imaging of patients
   enrolled in a clinical study at the Eye Institute of Austin and Duke Eye
   Center.}},

Abstract = {{Little numerical analysis has been done on in vivo vascular fluorescence
   imaging. Here, we use a 3D fluorescence Monte Carlo model to evaluate a
   microvasculature geometry obtained via two-photon microscopy. We found
   that a bulk-vascularization assumption does not pro-vide an accurate
   picture of penetration depth of the collected fluorescence signal.
   Instead the degree of absorption difference between extravascular and
   intravascular space, and the degree of stokes shift must be taken into
   account to determine the depth distribution. Additionally, we found that
   using targeted illumination can provide for superior surface vessel
   sensi-tivity over wide-field illumination, with small area detection
   offering an even greater amount of sensitivity to surface vasculature.
   Depth sensitivity can be enhanced by either increasing the detector area
   or increasing the illumination area. Finally, we see that excitation
   wavelength and vessel size can affect intra-vessel sampling
   distribution, as well as the amount of signal that originates from
   inside the vessel under targeted illumination conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallinity of PLA is an important factor that affects its
   processability mechanical strength, biodegradability, and service
   temperature. In this paper crystallization of PLA in solid state foaming
   process was studied in two main aspects: gas sorption in saturation
   stage, and heating as well as stretching in foaming stage. During CO2
   saturation the equilibrium crystallinity jumped from 9.7\% at 2 MPa to
   26.4\% at 3 MPa CO2 pressure. Further increases in saturation pressure
   did not increase the crystallinity. In the gas sorption stage of the
   process, it was found that the crystallization reached equilibrium at
   approximately the same time as the gas sorption reached equilibrium.
   Within the range of 2 to 5 MPa saturation pressures and 60 to 100
   degrees C foaming temperatures, a maximum crystallinity of 26.8\% was
   observed in the foamed PLA. Crystallinity increased with the extent of
   cell-wall stretching during the foaming process.}},

Abstract = {{Three vinyl functionalized imidazolium based room-temperature ionic
   liquids (RTILs): 1-vinyl-3-ethylimidazolium dicyanamide
   ({[}veim]{[}dca]), 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium dicyanamide
   ({[}vbim]{[}dca]) and 1-vinyl-3-heptylimidazolium dicyanamide
   ({[}vhim]{[}dca]) were synthesized and UV-polymerized to form free
   standing membranes. The pure gas permeabilities of CO2 and N-2 of these
   newly developed membranes acquired at 1 atm 35 degrees C increased with
   an increase in the number of N-alkyl group in the monomers but their
   ideal CO2-N-2 selectivities decreased. The three vinyl functionalized
   monomers were blended with three free RTILs: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   dicyanamide ({[}emim]{[}dca]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   tetracyanoborate ({[}emim]{[}B(CN)(4)]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   tetrafluoroborate ({[}emim]{[}BF4]) and subsequently subjected to
   UV-polymerization to form the poly (RTIL)-RTIL composite membranes. The
   incorporation of free RTILs not only significantly increases the CO2
   permeability but also greatly improves the CO2-N-2 selectivity. The best
   separation performance is achieved for the
   poly({[}vbim]{[}dca])-{[}emim]{[}B(CN)(4)] (1 : 2) and
   poly({[}vbim]{[}dca])-{[}emim]{[}dca] (1 : 2) composite membranes, which
   have CO2 permeabilities of 340 and 273 barrers and CO2-N-2 selectivities
   of 42 and 53, respectively, at 1 atm 35 degrees C. The mixed gas
   permeabilities of these two composite membranes are 297 and 253.5
   barrers with corresponding CO2-N-2 selectivities of 38.8 and 50.6,
   respectively, using a 50 : 50 CO2-N-2 mixed gas at 2 atm 35 degrees C.
   These two composite membranes have separation performance very close to
   the 2008 ``Robeson Upper Bound{''}, suggesting their potential for
   industrial applications, especially for the post-combustion flue gas
   treatment.}},

Title = {{Theoretical and experimental investigation of the motion of multiphase
   fluids containing paramagnetic nanoparticles in porous media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{129-144}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Paramagnetic nanoparticles are potentially useful for monitoring of
   immiscible fluids distribution in subsurface, as they can be induced to
   move by an imposed magnetic field. The nanoparticles can be designed to
   be preferentially adsorbed at oil-water interface, as well as to have
   the long-term dispersion stability with minimal retention in the porous
   medium to be monitored.
   When exposed to magnetic field, they generate sufficient interfacial
   movements for external detection. When paramagnetic nanoparticles are
   either adsorbed at oil-water or air-water interface or dispersed in one
   of two fluid phases co-existing in pores, and exposed to external
   magnetic field, the resultant particle movements displace the interface.
   Interfacial tension acts as a restoring force, leading to interfacial
   fluctuation and a pressure (sound) wave. Our previous work (Prodanovic
   et al., 2010) provided a theoretical explanation for the motion of the
   interface between a suspension of paramagnetic nanorods and a
   non-magnetized fluid in a cylindrical dish, as measured by
   phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT). Here we report on
   additional experiments carried out with a range of in-house synthesized
   and surface-modified iron-oxide nanoparticles. We also improved
   numerical method to be volume conserving for more quantitative matching.
   The measurements of interfacial motion by PS-OCT reported confirm
   theoretical predictions of the frequency doubling and the importance of
   material properties, such as magnetic susceptibility, for the interface
   displacement.
   The results are encouraging: this laboratory and modeling study is thus
   an important step to develop a magnetic field-based method for an
   accurate, non-invasive determination of multiphase fluids distribution
   in reservoir rock. With the combined experimental and modeling work,
   strategies for improved nanoparticle design will be developed so that
   the interfacial, thereby acoustic, response can be magnified. (C) 2011

   Only the most evolutionary ancient domain of Ember is able to synthesize
   an orange-emitting chromophore (emission at 571 nm), while the other
   three are purely green (emission at 520 nm) and putatively serve to
   maintain the stability and solubility of the multidomain protein. When
   expressed individually, two of the green Ember domains form dimers and
   the third one exists as a monomer. The low propensity for
   oligomerization of these domains would simplify their adoption as in
   vivo labels. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized direction in
   which natural FPs have diversified, suggesting new avenues to look for
   FPs with novel and potentially useful features.}},

Abstract = {{Short-wavelength quantum cascade laser (QCL) sources, based on
   transversely integrated giant nonlinearity have been designed and
   fabricated. Devices consist of an injectorless GaInAs/AlInAs/InP pump
   QCL and a passive two-well based nonlinearity grown on top of the pump
   active region. The nonlinearity was designed to possess a giant
   nonlinear response for the process of second-harmonic generation (SHG).
   For efficient SHG process, the wave-vector mismatch between the
   fundamental and the nonlinear signals was compensated by structuring the
   nonlinear layer into the 50 \% duty-cycle quasi-phase-matching gratings.
   Using this approach we were able to demonstrate room-temperature
   operation at 3.5 mu m and 2.7 mu m second-harmonic emission wavelengths

Title = {{Comparison of Test Methods for Determining the Particle Removal
   Efficiency of Filters in Residential and Light-Commercial Central HVAC
   Systems}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Central heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) filters are
   often the dominant mechanism for particle removal in buildings. However,
   little is known about filter performance in real environments,
   particularly in residential and light-commercial buildings where
   particle concentrations and compositions can be very different from
   laboratory test conditions. This article explores differences in HVAC
   filter test protocols and refines a whole-house method for in situ
   testing of filters for size-resolved particle removal efficiencies.
   Results from the in situ method are compared with those from a simple
   upstream-downstream method for three types of commercially available
   filters in an unoccupied test house. Results from both field methods are
   compared with standardized laboratory test results as measured by an
   independent laboratory and as reported by the manufacturer. In general,
   comparisons between filter efficiency as measured by the refined
   whole-house method and as measured by the upstream-downstream method
   resulted in similar values of particle removal efficiency for many
   particle sizes and compared well with standardized lab tests, although
   experimental uncertainties were generally greatest for the whole-house
   method. However, the refined whole-house method has the added benefit of
   allowing an investigation of more particle interactions in an indoor
   environment, including deposition to ductwork and other HVAC system
   components, exfiltration through duct leakage, and bypass airflow around
   filters. Both field methods can be used to investigate the effects of
   HVAC system characteristics and dust loading on filter efficiency in
   real environments.}},

   This method, i.e., real-time DNA microarrays, enhances the detection

   saturation, washing artifacts, microarray spot-to-spot variations, and
   other intensity-affecting impediments. We demonstrate in both theory and
   practice that the time-constant of target capturing is inversely
   proportional to the concentration of the target analyte, which we take
   advantage of as the fundamental parameter to estimate the concentration
   of the analytes. Furthermore, to experimentally validate the
   capabilities of this method in practical applications, we present a

Abstract = {{UCST-type interpenetrated and random copolymer microgels of

   Dynamic light scattering was used to study both the swelling behavior as

   the system. Concerning the structural characterization, a combination of
   the equilibrium swelling theory (Peppas-Merrill equation) and AFM
   technique was used to determine the mesh size of microgels. An
   oscillatory rheometer was used to study the viscoelastic properties. The
   moduli, G' and G `', of the microgel dispersions suggested a solid-like
   behaviour and structure formation. Scaling theory was applied to
   describe the structure formation (clustering) and the fractal dimension.
   The influence of composition and type of microgel, random or

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{4083-4089}},
Abstract = {{This study uses a combination of stochastic optimization, statistical
   mechanical theory, and molecular simulation to test the extent to which
   the long-time dynamics of a single tracer particle can be enhanced by
   rationally modifying its interactions-and hence static correlations-with
   the other particles of a dense fluid. Specifically, a simulated
   annealing strategy is introduced that, when coupled with test-particle
   calculations from an accurate density functional theory, finds
   interactions that maximize either the tracer's partial molar excess
   entropy or a related pair-correlation measure (i.e., two quantities
   known to correlate with tracer diffusivity in other contexts). The
   optimized interactions have soft, Yukawa-like repulsions, which extend
   beyond the hard-sphere interaction and disrupt the coordination-shell
   cage structure surrounding the tracer. Molecular and Brownian dynamics
   simulations find that tracers with these additional soft repulsions can
   diffuse more than three times faster than bare hard spheres in a
   moderately supercooled fluid, despite the fact that the former appear
   considerably larger than the latter by conventional definitions of
   particle size.}},

Pages = {{4216-4222}},
Abstract = {{Many rheological properties of concentrated suspensions of soft
   particles jammed together beyond the random close packing limit for
   hard-spheres are determined by the contacts between the particles and
   are computable from the short range value of the pair distribution
   function. It is a challenge to compute the structure of these amorphous
   suspensions because they are athermal, non-equilibrium materials. Here
   we develop a microscopic theory to predict the short ranged pair
   distribution function with a transport or conservation of mass equation
   for the stationary state that includes a concentration dependent mean
   force that captures the effect of the bulk suspension on the pair
   interaction. The resulting distribution function is singular as the
   concentration approaches random close packing as expected from the
   theory for hard spheres. The pair distribution function and elastic
   properties that can be calculated from it are validated by computer
   simulations and experiments with concentrated suspensions of particles
   with varying soft potentials.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives The macrophage is an important early cellular
   marker related to risk of future rupture of atherosclerotic plaques.
   Two-channel two-photon luminescence (TPL) microscopy combined with
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to detect, and further
   characterize the distribution of aorta-based macrophages using plasmonic
   gold nanorose as an imaging contrast agent.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods: Nanorose uptake by macrophages was
   identified by TPL microscopy in macrophage cell culture. Ex vivo aorta
   segments (8 x 8 x 2 mm(3)) rich in macrophages from a rabbit model of
   aorta inflammation were imaged by TPL microscopy in combination with
   OCT. Aorta histological sections (5 mm in thickness) were also imaged by
   TPL microscopy.
   Results: Merged two-channel TPL images showed the lateral and depth
   distribution of nanorose-loaded macrophages (confirmed by RAM-11 stain)
   and other aorta components (e.g., elastin fiber and lipid droplet),
   suggesting that nanorose-loaded macrophages are diffusively distributed
   and mostly detected superficially within 20 mm from the luminal surface
   of the aorta. Moreover, OCT images depicted detailed surface structure
   of the diseased aorta.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that TPL microscopy combined with OCT can
   simultaneously reveal macrophage distribution with respect to aorta
   surface structure, which has the potential to detect vulnerable plaques
   and monitor plaque-based macrophages overtime during cardiovascular
   interventions. Lasers Surg. Med. 44:49-59, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Rheological properties of microalgae slurries were measured as a
   function of biomass concentration from 0.5 to 80 kg/m(3) for
   Nannochloris sp., Chlorella vulgaris, and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. At
   biomass concentrations smaller than 20 kg/m(3), all slurries displayed a
   Newtonian fluid behavior with less than 30\% increase in the effective
   viscosity from that of the nutrient medium. However, at biomass
   concentrations larger than 60 kg/m(3), the slurries of the green algae,
   Nannochloris sp. and C. vulgaris, displayed a shear thinning
   non-Newtonian behavior with varying degrees of sensitivity to shear rate
   while that of the diatom, P. tricornutum, was still a Newtonian fluid up
   to 80 kg/m(3). Moreover, bioenergy pumping effectiveness showed
   significant deviation among different species in the non-Newtonian
   regime. Finally, dewatering the slurries to concentration factors larger
   than 80 did not further increase the total bioenergy harvest
   effectiveness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the properties of a novel discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG)
   method for acoustic wave propagation. The method yields Hermitian
   positive definite matrices and has good pre-asymptotic stability
   properties. Numerically, we find that the method exhibits negligible
   phase errors (otherwise known as pollution errors) even in the lowest
   order case. Theoretically, we are able to prove error estimates that
   explicitly show the dependencies with respect to the wavenumber omega,
   the mesh size h, and the polynomial degree p. But the current state of
   the theory does not fully explain the remarkably good numerical phase
   errors. Theoretically, comparisons are made with several other recent
   works that gave wave number explicit estimates. Numerically. comparisons
   are made with the standard finite element method and its recent
   modification for wave propagation with clever quadratures. The new DPG
   method is designed following the previously established principles of
   optimal test functions. In addition to the nonstandard test functions,
   in this work, we also use a nonstandard wave number dependent norm on
   both the test and trial space to obtain our error estimates. (C) 2011

   reduction models relevant to shock tube experiments}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{213}},
Pages = {{383-398}},
Abstract = {{Experimental raw data provided by measuring instruments often need to be
   converted into meaningful physical quantities through data reduction
   modeling processes in order to be useful for comparison with outputs of
   computer simulations. These processes usually employ mathematical models
   that have to be properly calibrated and rigorously validated so that
   their reliability can be clearly assessed. A validation procedure based
   on a Bayesian approach is applied here to a data reduction model used in
   shock tube experiments. In these experiments, the raw data, given in
   terms of photon counts received by an ICCD camera, are post-processed
   into radiative intensities. Simple mathematical models describing the
   nonlinear behavior associated with very short opening times (gate
   widths) of the camera are developed, calibrated, and not invalidated, or
   invalidated, in this study. The main objective here is to determine the
   feasibility of the methodology to precisely quantify the uncertainties
   emanating from the raw data and from the choice of the reduction model.
   In this analysis of the methodology, shortcomings, suggested
   improvements, and future research areas are also highlighted.
   Experimental data collected at the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST)
   facility at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) are employed to
   illustrate the validation procedure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{213}},
Pages = {{399-417}},
Abstract = {{This paper is the first in this series to develop a numerical
   homogenization method for heterogeneous media and integrate it with
   goal-oriented finite element mesh adaptivity. We describe the physical
   application, Step and Flash Imprint Lithography, in brief and present
   the mathematical ideas and numerical verification. The method requires
   the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of element stiffness matrices.
   Algorithms for efficiently computing the pseudoinverse of sparse
   matrices will be presented in the second paper.
   The purpose of numerical homogenization is to reduce the number of
   degrees of freedom, find locally optimal effective material properties,
   and perform goal-oriented mesh refinement. Traditionally, a finite
   element mesh is designed after obtaining material properties in
   different regions. The mesh has to resolve material discontinuities and
   rapid variations in the solution. In our approach, however, we generate
   a sequence of coarse meshes (possibly 1-irregular), and homogenize
   material properties on each coarse mesh element using a locally posed
   constrained convex quadratic optimization problem. This upscaling is
   done using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the linearized fine-scale
   element stiffness matrices, and a material-independent interpolation
   operator.
   Numerical verification is done using a two dimensional conductivity
   problem with known analytical limit. Finally, we present results for two
   and three dimensional geometries. The results show that this method uses
   orders of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom to give fast and
   approximate solutions of the original fine-scale problem. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This study compares and analyzes the relationship of design-build (DB)
   and design-bid-build (DBB) project delivery methods with performance
   metrics of large highway projects (> \$50 million). Project performance
   is measured in cost, schedule, and change orders on these two types of
   highway projects. This study also investigates associations between
   project characteristics (input variables) and project performance
   (output variables) of large highway projects. The performance comparison
   methodology used here is derived from work done on a Texas Department of
   Transportation study of the State Highway 130 Project. The study results
   show that the construction speed and project delivery speed per lane
   mile (or lane kilometer) of DB projects were significantly faster than
   that of DBB projects for this sample. The study also showed that out of
   21 inputs analyzed, 14 inputs have statistically significant
   associations with one or more outputs of these projects. DOI:

Abstract = {{Metabolic engineers modify biological systems through the use of modern
   molecular biology tools in order to obtain desired phenotypes. However,
   due to the extreme complexity and interconnectedness of metabolism in
   all organisms, it is often difficult to a priori predict which changes
   will yield the optimal results. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a
   mathematical approach that uses a genomic-scale metabolic network models
   to afford in silico prediction and optimization of metabolic changes. In
   particular, a genome-scale approach can help select gene targets for
   knockout and overexpression. This approach can be used to help expedite
   the strain engineering process. Here, we give an introduction to the use
   of FBA and provide details for its implementation in a microbial

Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{1033-1040}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we report the electrochemical synthesis of core@shell
   dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) consisting of cores
   containing 147 Au atoms (Au-147) and Pt shells having similar to 54 or
   similar to 102 atoms (Au-147@Pt-n (n = 54 or 102)). The significance of
   this work arises from the correlation of the experimentally determined
   structural and electrocatalytic properties of these particles with
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, we describe
   an experimental and theoretical study of Pb underpotential deposition
   (UPD) on Au-147 DENs, the structure of both Au-147@Pb-n and Au-147@Pt-n
   DENs, and the activity of these DENs for the oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR). DFT calculations show that Pb binding is stronger on the (100)
   facets of Au as compared to (111), and the calculated deposition and
   stripping potentials are consistent with those measured experimentally.
   Galvanic exchange is used to replace the surface Pb atoms with Pt, and a
   surface distortion is found for Au-147@Pt-n particles using molecular
   dynamics simulations in which the Pt-covered (100) facets shear into
   (111) diamond structures. DFT calculations of oxygen binding show that
   the distorted surfaces are the most active for the ORR, and that their
   activity is similar regardless of the Pt coverage. These calculations
   are consistent with rotating ring-disk voltammetry measurements.}},

Abstract = {{When evaluating the condition and safety of a steel structure following
   a fire, an issue of concern is the mechanical properties of the steel
   after the fire. The exposure of the steel to high temperatures during
   the fire, and the subsequent cooling of the steel after the fire, can
   potentially affect the mechanical properties of the steel. A testing
   program was undertaken to measure the mechanical properties of ASTM A992
   steel after being subjected to various patterns of heating and cooling.
   This paper presents results of the test program and provides data on the
   effect of various heating and cooling cycles on key mechanical
   properties, including yield strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus,
   elongation, Charpy V-Notch (CVN) impact values and hardness.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue cracking models are important for the design, analysis, and
   management of pavement structures. There are two types of cracking
   models available in the literature. The first type of model is
   structured to predict time to failure (given a specific failure
   criterion, e.g., 25\% of the total area shows cracking). The other type
   of model is intended to directly predict the cracking area as a function
   of a set of covariates. For the first type of model, previous
   researchers have suggested a probabilistic approach such as survival
   modeling (or duration modeling) to take various uncertainties into
   consideration. However, to the authors' knowledge, no current study
   considers the effect of heterogeneity when applying survival models to
   pavement fatigue cracking. In the context of deterioration modeling,
   heterogeneity can be defined as the performance difference across
   different individuals. Ignoring unobserved heterogeneity may lead to
   biased and inconsistent parameter estimates. The current paper proposes
   applying the frailty model to address this problem by adding a random
   term to the hazard function. The proposed model is demonstrated using
   the long-term pavement performance (LTPP) database. DOI:

Abstract = {{When coupled with multiple displacement amplification (MDA),
   microarray-based comparative genomic intensity allows detection of
   chromosome copy number aberrations even in single or few cells, but the
   actual performance of the system and their influencing factors have not
   been well defined. Here, using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
   array, we analyzed copy number profiles from DNA amplified by MDA in 110
   cells and estimated the accuracy and spatial resolution of the analysis.
   Based on the concordance of SNP copy numbers for DNA with and without
   MDA, the accuracy of the system can be significantly enhanced by using
   MDA-amplified DNA as reference and also by increasing the cell numbers.
   Analyses under different smoothing treatments revealed a practical
   resolution of 2?Mb for 10 cells and 10?Mb for a single cell. When both
   cells with known chromosomal duplication and deletion were analyzed,
   this platform detected a copy number loss more accurately than a gain (P
   < 0.01), particularly in single-cell MDA products. Together, we
   demonstrated that SNP array coupled with MDA is reliable and efficient
   for detection of copy number aberrations in a small number of cells, and
   its accuracy and resolution can both be significantly enhanced with
   increasing the number of cells as MDA template.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{209}},

Abstract = {{We generalize the recently introduced twist-Kirchhoff theory of
   rectangular plate elements to arbitrary quadrilateral elements. A key
   feature is the use of Raviart-Thomas vector-field approximations for
   rotations. To preserve continuity of the normal components of the
   rotation vector across mesh edges, we employ the Piola transformation to
   map the rotations from the parent domain to the physical domain. These
   elements possess a unique combination of efficiency and robustness in
   that minimal quadrature rules are sufficient to guarantee stability
   without rank deficiency. In particular, only one-point Gauss quadrature
   is required for the lowest-order element in the twist-Kirchhoff family.
   We numerically study the convergence and accuracy of the first two
   members of the twist-Kirchhoff family of quadrilateral elements on
   square, rhombic and circular plate problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional mortar-based frictional contact treatment in
   isogeometric analysis with NURBS is presented in the finite deformation
   regime. Within a setting where the NURBS discretization of the contact
   surface is inherited directly from the NURBS discretization of the

   local contact interactions with respect to alternative Lagrange
   discretizations independent of the discretization order. These enable
   the achievement of improved smoothness in global contact forces and

   Anal., to appear], we develop and analyze a numerical method to solve a
   probabilistic inverse sensitivity analysis problem for a smooth
   deterministic map assuming that the map can be evaluated exactly. In
   this paper, we treat the situation in which the output of the map is
   determined implicitly and is difficult and/or expensive to evaluate,
   e.g., requiring the solution of a differential equation, and hence the
   output of the map is approximated numerically. The main goal is an a
   posteriori error estimate that can be used to evaluate the accuracy of
   the computed distribution solving the inverse problem, taking into
   account all sources of statistical and numerical deterministic errors.
   We present a general analysis for the method and then apply the analysis
   to the case of a map determined by the solution of an initial value
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer has become the leading cause of death in the developed world and
   has remained one of the most difficult diseases to treat. One of the
   difficulties in treating cancer is that conventional chemotherapies
   often have unacceptable toxicities toward normal cells at the doses
   required to kill tumor cells. Thus, the demand for new and improved
   tumor specific therapeutics for the treatment of cancer remains high.
   Alterations to cellular metabolism constitute a nearly universal feature
   of many types of cancer cells. In particular, many tumors exhibit
   deficiencies in one or more amino acid synthesis or salvage pathways
   forcing a reliance on the extracellular pool of these amino acids to
   satisfy protein biosynthesis demands. Therefore, one treatment modality
   that satisfies the objective of developing cancer cell-selective
   therapeutics is the systemic depletion of that tumor-essential amino
   acid, which can result in tumor apoptosis with minimal side effects to
   normal cells. While this strategy was initially suggested over 50 years
   ago, it has been recently experiencing a renaissance owing to advances
   in protein engineering technology, and more sophisticated approaches to
   studying the metabolic differences between tumorigenic and normal cells.
   Dietary restriction is typically not sufficient to achieve a
   therapeutically relevant level of amino acid depletion for cancer
   treatment. Therefore, intravenous administration of enzymes is used to
   mediate the degradation of such amino acids for therapeutic purposes.
   Unfortunately, the human genome does not encode enzymes with the
   requisite catalytic or pharmacological properties necessary for
   therapeutic purposes.
   The use of heterologous enzymes has been explored extensively both in
   animal studies and in clinical trials. However, heterologous enzymes are
   immunogenic and elicit adverse responses ranging from anaphylactic shock
   to antibody-mediated enzyme inactivation, and therefore have had limited
   utility. The one notable exception is Escherichia coli L-asparaginase II
   (EcAII), which has been FDA-approved for the treatment of childhood
   acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The use of engineered human enzymes, to
   which natural tolerance is likely to prevent recognition by the adaptive
   immune system, offers a novel approach for capitalizing on the promising
   strategy of systemic depletion of tumor-essential amino acids. In this
   work, we review several strategies that we have developed to: (i) reduce
   the immunogenicity of a nonhuman enzyme, (ii) engineer human enzymes for
   novel catalytic specificities, and (iii) improve the pharmacological
   characteristics of a human enzyme that exhibits the requisite substrate
   specificity for amino acid degradation but exhibits low activity and
   stability under physiological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of highly potent and cytotoxic drugs, it is increasingly
   critical that they be targeted and released only in cells of diseased
   tissues, while sparing physiologically normal neighbors. Simple
   ligand-based targeting of drug carriers, although promising, cannot
   always provide the required specificity to achieve this since often
   normal cells also express significant levels of the targeted receptors.
   Therefore, stimuli-responsive delivery systems are being explored to
   allow drug release from nano- and microcarriers and implantable devices,
   primarily in the presence of physiological or disease-specific
   pathophysiological signals. Designing smart biomaterials that respond to
   temperature or pH changes, protein and ligand binding, disease-specific
   degradation, e. g. enzymatic cleavage, has become an integral part of
   this approach. These strategies are used in combination with nano- and
   microparticle systems to improve delivery efficiency through several
   routes of administration, and with injectable or implantable systems for
   long term controlled release. This review focuses on recent developments
   in stimuli-responsive systems, their physicochemical properties, release
   profiles, efficacy, safety and biocompatibility, as well as future
   perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe the design and performance of nonlinear
   quantum cascade laser sources for near-infrared and terahertz
   applications. Our devices are based on monolithically integrated
   mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers and passive nonlinear structures
   which provide a giant nonlinear response for the pumping frequency. Such
   design concept can be applied for both short-wavelength and
   long-wavelength generation. In our work, short-wavelength devices were
   based on the concept of second-harmonic generation whereas
   long-wavelength devices utilized difference-frequency generation. With
   this approach we demonstrate room-temperature operation down to 2.7 mu m
   for near-infrared devices and up to 70 mu m at 210 K for terahertz
   devices. The performance of our nonlinear devices is very sensitive to
   the resonance condition for the pump and nonlinearity. We demonstrate
   that, once resonant, nonlinear powers in the mW range are available.}},

Title = {{Effects of Additives on Properties of Rapid-Setting Controlled
   Low-Strength Material Mixtures}},
Journal = {{ACI MATERIALS JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{109}},

Abstract = {{Rapid-setting controlled low-strength material (RS-CLSM) is a special
   type of CLSM that is characterized by rapid setting, hardening, and
   early-strength development, making it well suited for rapid repair and
   accelerated construction. RS-CLSM mixtures are typically comprised of
   ASTM C618 Class C fly ash, sand, and water. In this study, research was
   performed to evaluate the effects of different Class C fly ashes and
   dosages, and the addition of various additives on the fresh properties
   and early strength of RS-CLSM mixtures. Two Class F fly ashes were used
   as additives at replacement levels of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35\% of
   Class C fly ash. The results showed that they were not effective in
   extending the flowability time window of RS-CISM. Gypsum was added to
   RS-CLSM mixtures at dosages of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\%. No significant
   retarding effects were found with the dosing levels. By contrast, the
   addition of hemihydrate was found to be more effective in changing the
   fresh properties when the same dosages as gypsum were used. Aluminum
   sulfate was found to be the most effective to delay or even prohibit the
   hydration of Class C fly ash for up to 24 hours, when dosages of less
   than 5\% were used. The addition of Type I portland cement at levels of
   1, 2, 3, and 4\% was also studied and the effects differed with the
   Class C fly ashes used. Different possible reactions to explain the
   results are discussed. In summary, this study found that RS-CLSM
   mixtures made of different Class C fly ashes possess different fresh
   properties and respond differently to various additives; such knowledge
   may be applied to the optimization of RS-CLSM for desired workability,
   setting, hardening, and early-strength development.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoplates are introduced as a new photoacoustic contrast agent
   that can be easily functionalized for molecular photoacoustic Imaging in
   vivo. Methods are described for synthesis, functionalization, and
   stabilization of silver nanoplates using biocompatible ({''}green{''})
   reagents. Directional antibody conjugation to the nanoplate surface is
   presented along with proof of molecular sensitivity in vitro with
   pancreatic cancer cells. Cell viability tests show the
   antibody-conjugated silver nanoplates to be nontoxic at concentrations
   up to 1 mg/mL. Furthermore, the silver nanoplates' potential for in vivo
   application as a molecularly sensitive photoacoustic contrast agent is
   demonstrated using an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer.
   Results of these studies suggest that the synthesized silver nanoplates
   are well suited for a host of biomedical imaging and sensing

Title = {{Chemical structures of hydrazine-treated graphene oxide and generation

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Chemically modified graphene platelets, produced via graphene oxide,
   show great promise in a variety of applications due to their electrical,
   thermal, barrier and mechanical properties. Understanding the chemical
   structures of chemically modified graphene platelets will aid in the
   understanding of their physical properties and facilitate development of
   chemically modified graphene platelet chemistry. Here we use C-13 and
   N-15 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy to study the chemical structure of
   N-15-labelled hydrazine-treated C-13-labelled graphite oxide and
   unlabelled hydrazine-treated graphene oxide, respectively. These
   experiments suggest that hydrazine treatment of graphene oxide causes
   insertion of an aromatic N-2 moiety in a five-membered ring at the
   platelet edges and also restores graphitic networks on the basal planes.
   Furthermore, density-functional theory calculations support the
   formation of such N-2 structures at the edges and help to elucidate the
   influence of the aromatic N-2 moieties on the electronic structure of
   chemically modified graphene platelets.}},

   nanodroplet vaporization for contrast-enhanced imaging}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Since being discovered by Alexander Bell, photoacoustics may again be
   seeing major resurgence in biomedical imaging. Photoacoustics is a
   non-ionizing, functional imaging modality capable of high contrast
   images of optical absorption at depths significantly greater than
   traditional optical imaging techniques. Optical contrast agents have
   been used to extend photoacoustics to molecular imaging. Here we
   introduce an exogenous contrast agent that utilizes vaporization for
   photoacoustic signal generation, providing significantly higher signal
   amplitude than that from the traditionally used mechanism, thermal
   expansion. Our agent consists of liquid perfluorocarbon nanodroplets
   with encapsulated plasmonic nanoparticles, entitled photoacoustic
   nanodroplets. Upon pulsed laser irradiation, liquid perfluorocarbon
   undergoes a liquid-to-gas phase transition generating giant
   photoacoustic transients from these dwarf nanoparticles. Once triggered,
   the gaseous phase provides ultrasound contrast enhancement. We
   demonstrate in phantom and animal studies that photoacoustic
   nanodroplets act as dual-contrast agents for both photoacoustic and
   ultrasound imaging through optically triggered vaporization.}},

   in good to excellent yields (39-100\%) at GO loadings ranging from
   2.5-20.0 wt\%. Using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), it was determined that the carbon catalyst
   was retained and homogeneously dispersed within the polymer product,
   resulting in the formation of a carbon-filled composite. TEM also
   revealed that the carbon transitioned from the lamellar morphology found
   in GO primarily to nanometre-sized, multiwalled fullerenes; no other
   discrete carbon morphologies were observed. The inclusion of the carbon
   material in the polyesters was found to improve the mechanical stiffness
   of the polymers by up to 400\%, as compared to the neat homopolymer.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a thermodynamically consistent four-species
   model of tumor growth on the basis of the continuum theory of mixtures.
   Unique to this model is the incorporation of nutrient within the mixture
   as opposed to being modeled with an auxiliary reaction-diffusion
   equation. The formulation involves systems of highly nonlinear partial
   differential equations of surface effects through diffuse-interface
   models. A mixed finite element spatial discretization is developed and
   implemented to provide numerical results demonstrating the range of
   solutions this model can produce. A time-stepping algorithm is then
   presented for this system, which is shown to be first order accurate and
   energy gradient stable. The results of an array of numerical experiments
   are presented, which demonstrate a wide range of solutions produced by
   various choices of model parameters.Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{PECVD and PEALD of ruthenium films using RuEtcp(2) as a precursor and
   N-2/H-2/Ar plasma as a reducing agent were characterized. A
   self-adjusting process to overcome the previously reported inhibition of
   Ru PEALD on TaN substrates was investigated. Ellipsometric modelling of
   Ru films was demonstrated providing information on both film thickness
   and estimated Ru content. The physical properties of PECVD/PEALD Ru
   films were compared to characteristics of sputtered Ru films within the
   categories resistivity, impurites, crystal structure, conformity and Cu
   plating. As a result, ToFSIMS, ERDA and 3D atomprobe revealed the
   presence of carbon impurities in PECVD and PEALD Ru films, dependent on
   deposition temperature and plasma power. Nevertheless, highly conductive
   Ru-C films were produced via PECVD and PEALD achieving resistivities
   equal to PVD Ru. For all types of Ru films, the size effect played a
   significant role at thicknesses below 10 nm; Cu plating and
   crystallization behaviour appeared similar. Direct Cu fill potential of
   different Ru films was discussed for damascene structures and through
   silicon vias. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The fabrication of electronic devices on flexible substrates represents
   an opportunity for the development of flexible display technologies,

   Traditional photolithography encounters alignment and overlay
   limitations when applied to flexible substrates. One solution to the
   overlay challenges is imaging of two device layers in a single
   lithographic exposure. To enable the simultaneous patterning of two
   device layers, a new photoresist system was developed. Prior work on
   dual-tone photoresists introduced formulations capable of storing two
   independent images, but the reported systems are incompatible with the
   reactive ion etch processes commonly used today. This paper describes a
   dual-tone photoresist system that maintains the ability to store two
   independent latent images, distinguished by the incident exposure light

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to determine in-plane lateral stiffness,
   strength, and hysteretic behavior of steel moment frames infilled with
   autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC). A typical bare steel frame was first
   tested under a history of reversed cyclic loading to monotonically
   increasing lateral displacements. The frame was then infilled with AAC
   and subjected to the same loading history. A comparison of the resulting
   lateral load-deflection curves of the bare and infilled frame is used to
   extract hysteretic behavior of the AAC infill. This extracted hysteretic
   behavior of the AAC infill is used to verify equations for stiffness and
   strength of infills being developed by Masonry Standards Joint Committee
   (MSJC) in the United States. The hysteretic behavior of the MC infill is
   also used to calibrate an analytical model for AAC infills based on the
   equivalent strut approach that can be used to study seismic behavior of
   AAC-infilled frames.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites composed of MnO2 and graphitic disordered mesoporous
   carbon (MnO2/C) were synthesized for high total specific capacitance and
   redox pseudocapacitance (C-MnO2) at high scan rates up to 200 mV s(-1).
   High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) demonstrated that MnO2 nanodomains
   were highly dispersed throughout the mesoporous carbon structure.
   According to HRTEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD), the MnO2 domains are
   shown to be primarily amorphous and less than 5 nm in size. For these
   composites in aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, C-MnO2 reached 500
   F/g(MnO2) at 2 mV s(-1) for 8.8 wt\% MnO2. A capacitance fade of only
   20\% over a 100-fold change in scan rate was observed for a high loading
   of 35 wt\% MnO2 with a C-MnO2 of 310 F/g(MnO2) at the highest scan rate
   of 200 mV s(-1). The high electronic conductivity of the graphitic 3D

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Cu2Sb-Al2O3-C nanocomposite alloy material has been synthesized via a
   mechanochemical reduction of Sb2O3 with Al and Cu metals in the presence
   of carbon (acetylene black). X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveal that these
   nanocomposites are composed of nanostructured Cu2Sb particles in an
   amorphous Al2O3 and conductive carbon matrix. The presence of Al2O3 in
   the nanocomposite drastically improves the cycle life of the Cu2Sb-C
   material and enables a remarkable capacity retention of 80\% over 500
   cycles (330 mAh/g) after the first cycle. With a tap density of similar
   to 1.4 g cm(-3), Cu2Sb-Al2O3-C offers significantly higher volumetric
   capacity than the commonly used graphite anode. A conductive Cu
   framework supports the electrochemically-active Sb and results in low
   impedance and good rate capability, while the matrix of ceramic oxide
   and conductive carbon reduce the agglomeration of the nanocrystalline
   Cu2Sb particles and buffer the volume expansion/contraction that occurs
   during cycling. TEM of the electrodes that were cycled between 1 and 500
   cycles shows the evolution of the morphology of Cu2Sb particles in the
   presence and absence of Al2O3. Because the Cu2Sb-Al2O3-C nanocomposite
   electrodes can operate well above the potential where lithium plating
   occurs, it is viewed as a safer alternative to graphite anodes.}},

   growth of graphene films}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Graphene growth on Cu foils by catalytic decomposition of methane forms
   predominantly single-layer graphene films due to the low solubility of
   carbon in Cu. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu-Ni foils can
   result in the controlled growth of few-layer graphene films because of
   the higher solubility of carbon in Ni. One of the key issues for the use
   of graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition for device applications
   is the influence of defects on the transport properties of the graphene.
   For instance, growth on metal foil substrates is expected to result in
   multidomain graphene growth because of the presence of grains within the
   foil that exhibit a variety of surface terminations. Therefore, the size
   and orientation of the grains within the metal foil should influence the
   defect density of the graphene. For this reason, we have studied the
   effect of total anneal time and temperature on the orientation and size
   of grains within Cu foils and Cu-Ni alloy foils with a nominal
   concentration of 90/10 by weight. The graphene growth procedure involves
   preannealing the foil in a H(2) background followed by the graphene
   growth in a CH(4)/H(2) atmosphere. Measurements of the substrate grain
   size have been performed with optical microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy. These results show typical lateral dimensions ranging from a
   few millimeters up to approximately a centimeter for Cu foils annealed
   at 1030 degrees C for 35 min and from tens of microns up to a few
   hundred microns for the 90/10 Cu-Ni foils annealed at 1050 degrees C for
   times ranging from 45 to 90 min. The smaller grains within the Cu-Ni
   foils are attributed to the higher melting point of the Cu-Ni alloy. The
   crystallographic orientation within each substrate grain was studied
   with electron backscatter diffraction, and shows that the preferred
   orientation for the Cu foil is primarily toward the (100) surface plane.
   For the 90/10 Cu-Ni foils, the orientation of the surface of the grains
   is initially toward the (110) plane and shifts into an orientation
   midway between the (100) and (111) planes as the anneal time is
   increased. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society. {[}DOI: 10.1116/1.3663877]}},

Abstract = {{Human recombinant arginase I cobalt {[}HuArgI (Co)] coupled with
   polyethylene glycol 5000 {[}HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000] has shown potent
   in-vitro depletion of arginine from tissue culture medium. We now show
   that HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 is toxic to almost all cancer cell lines and to
   some normal primary cells examined. In contrast, HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 in
   combination with supplemental L-citrulline is selectively cytotoxic to a
   fraction of human cancer cell lines in tissue culture, including some
   melanomas, mesotheliomas, acute myeloid leukemias, hepatocellular
   carcinomas, pancreas adenocarcinomas, prostate adenocarcinomas, lung
   adenocarcinomas, osteosarcomas, and small cell lung carcinomas.
   Unfortunately, a subset of normal human tissues is also sensitive to
   HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 with L-citrulline supplementation, including
   umbilical endothelial cells, bronchial epithelium, neurons, and renal
   epithelial cells. We further show that cell sensitivity is predicted by
   the level of cellular argininosuccinate synthetase protein expression
   measured by immunoblots. By comparing a 3-day and 7-day exposure to
   HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 with supplemental L-citrulline, some tumor cells
   sensitive on short-term assay are resistant in the 7-day assay
   consistent with the induction of argininosuccinate synthetase
   expression. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that HuArgI
   (Co)-PEG5000 in combination with L-citrulline supplementation may be an
   attractive therapeutic agent for some argininosuccinate
   synthetase-deficient tumors. These in-vitro findings stimulate further
   development of this molecule and may aid in the identification of tissue
   toxicities and better selection of patients who will potentially respond
   to this combination therapy. Anti-Cancer Drugs 23:51-64 (C) 2011 Wolters

Abstract = {{Introduction: Amino acid auxotrophy or the metabolic defect which
   renders cancer incapable of surviving under amino acid depleted
   conditions is being exploited and explored as a therapeutic against
   cancer. Early clinical data on asparagine-and arginine-depleting drugs
   have demonstrated low toxicity and efficacy in melanoma, hepatocellular
   carcinoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Methionine auxotrophy is a
   novel niche currently under exploration for targeting certain cancers.
   Areas covered: In this review we explore the discovery of methionine
   auxotrophy followed by in vitro, in vivo and patient data on targeting
   cancer with methionine depletion. We end with a small discussion on
   bioengineering, pegylation and red blood cell encapsulation as
   mechanisms for decreasing immunogenicity of methionine-depleting drugs.
   We hope to provide a platform for future pharmacology, toxicology and
   cytotoxicity studies with methionine depletion therapy and drugs.
   Expert opinion: Although methionine auxotrophy seems as a viable target,
   extensive research addressing normal versus cancer cell toxicity needs
   to be conducted. Further research also needs to be conducted into the
   molecular mechanism associated with methionine depletion therapy.
   Finally, novel methods need to be developed to decrease the
   immunogenicity of methionine-depleting drugs, a current issue with
   protein therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{A time-slotted queueing system for a wireless downlink with multiple
   flows and a single server is considered, with exogenous arrivals and
   time-varying channels. It is assumed that only one user can be serviced
   in a single time slot. Unlike much recent work on this problem,
   attention is drawn to the case where the server can obtain only partial
   information about the instantaneous state of the channel. In each time
   slot, the server is allowed to specify a single subset of flows from a
   collection of observable subsets, observe the current service rates for
   that subset, and subsequently pick a user to serve. The stability region
   for such a system is provided. An online scheduling algorithm is
   presented that uses information about marginal distributions to pick the
   subset and the Max-Weight rule to pick a flow within the subset, and
   which is provably throughput-optimal. In the case where the observable
   subsets are all disjoint, or where the subsets and channel statistics
   are symmetric, it is shown that a simple scheduling
   algorithm-Max-Sum-Queue-that essentially picks subsets having the
   largest squared-sum of queues, followed by picking a user using
   Max-Weight within the subset, is throughput-optimal.}},

Abstract = {{We present a conformal ink-jet printed 2-bit four-element phased-array
   antenna (PAA) without any lithography process. Passive and active
   components, such as microstrip transmission lines, phase shifters, and
   RF power distribution networks are all developed adopting a
   room-temperature printing process. The PAA working at 5.2 GHz is printed
   on flexible DuPont Kapton flexible printed circuit polyimide film to
   demonstrate the conformal nature. High-speed carbon-nanotube-based
   field-effect transistors (FETs) function as switches to route the RF
   signal go through different segments of the true-time delay lines. The
   FET switch exhibits an ON-OFF ratio of over 1000 and current of 3.6 mA
   is obtained at a low source-drain bias of 0.8 V. The 2-bit azimuth
   beamsteering angles of the PAA are measured and confirmed to agree well
   with simulation values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and characterization of self-aligned
   carbon nanotube thin-film transistors (CNT-TFT) on flexible substrates.
   The channel consisting of dense, aligned, 99\% pure semiconducting
   single-walled CNT is deposited using the dip-coat technique on a
   sacrificial substrate and then transferred on the device substrate. The
   source, drain, and gate structures are formed by the ink-jet printing
   technique. A novel source-drain contact formation using wet droplet of
   silver ink prior to the CNT thin-film application has been developed to
   enhance source-drain contact with the CNT channel. Bending test data on
   CNT-TFT test structures show minimal change (less than 10\%) in their
   performance. Moreover, a special multilayer metal interconnection
   technology is demonstrated for flexible electronics applications.
   Bending test data on via test structure show change in resistance by
   less than 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{A crucial aspect in boundary-coupled problems, such as fluid-structure
   interaction, pertains to the evaluation of fluxes. In boundary-coupled
   problems, the flux evaluation appears implicitly in the formulation and
   consequently, improper flux evaluation can lead to instability.
   Finite-element approximations of primal and dual problems corresponding
   to improper formulations can therefore be nonconvergent or display
   suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we consider the main
   aspects of flux evaluation in finite-element approximations of
   boundary-coupled problems. Based on a model problem, we consider various
   formulations and illustrate the implications for corresponding primal
   and dual problems. In addition, we discuss the extension to
   free-boundary problems, fluid-structure interaction, and electro-osmosis
   applications. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005187]}},

   separate three-impulse methods are presented, each specific to whether
   the time of flight is free or fixed. Numerical results, obtained using
   nonlinear programming algorithms, are presented to validate the

Abstract = {{Biological materials containing trace amounts of mercury and selenium
   were examined using neutron activation analysis. They were analyzed
   using Compton suppression and gamma-gamma coincidence counting. The 279
   keV photopeak of activated mercury (Hg-203) was analyzed in order to
   observe the mercury content in these samples. Selenium, an element found
   in many biological samples, interferes with the analysis of Hg-203 when
   activated (Se-75). Because the selenium interference comes from a
   cascading emission, Compton suppression was utilized to reduce this
   interference. In order to fully characterize the selenium content in the
   samples, gamma-gamma coincidence was used which reduced the background
   and eliminated bremsstrahlung interference produced from neutron
   activated phosphorous through the P-31(n, gamma)P-32 reaction which is a
   pure beta emitter. As a result, we determined the mercury and selenium
   concentrations in three standard reference materials, which contain
   varying ratios of mercury to selenium concentrations. This study also
   showed that these types of concentrations can be determined from small
   (< 500 mg) sample masses. Further work needs to be done on wet samples
   that require dehydration, as mercury can be lost through this process.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of Ar-37 is important for On-Site Inspections (OSI) for
   the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty monitoring. In an underground
   nuclear explosion this radionuclide is produced by Ca-40(n,alpha)Ar-37
   reaction in surrounding soil and rock. With a half-life of 35 days,
   Ar-37 provides a signal useful for confirming the location of an
   underground nuclear event. An ultra-low-background proportional counter
   developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is used to detect
   Ar-37, which decays via electron capture. The irradiation of Ar gas at
   natural enrichment in the 3L facility within the Mark II TRIGA reactor
   facility at The University of Texas at Austin provides a source of Ar-37
   for the calibration of the detector. The Ar-41 activity is measured by
   the gamma activity using an HPGe detector after the sample is removed
   from the core. Using the Ar-41/Ar-37 production ratio and the Ar-41
   activity, the amount of Ar-37 created is calculated. The Ar-41 decays
   quickly (half-life of 109.34 min) leaving a radioactive sample of high
   purity Ar-37 and only trace levels of Ar-39.}},

   phosphorylated silica frit membranes, formed meso-porous silica
   particles of 0.7-1.0 mu m diameter, sandwiched between porous,
   consumable, Nafion-coated Ag/Ag2O electrodes. The flow rates of pumps
   with membranes formed of the meso-porous silica particles were stable,
   remaining constant within +/- 12\% until >= 80\% of the 2.6 coulomb
   capacity of the Ag or Ag2O electrodes, sufficient for pumping about 5 mL
   water, was exhausted. The cause of the decay of the flow in these pumps
   is Ag+-accumulation at the non-mesoporous membrane surface, observed by
   metallic silver precipitation caused blackening of the light-exposed
   non-mesoporous membranes. When the membranes were made with the
   mesoporous particles, there was no silver precipitate on the membrane;
   instead, all of the silver was electrodeposited at the cathode. The
   stability of the flow of pumps made with meso-porous silica membranes is
   thus attributed to the rapid transport of Ag+-transport to the cathode.

Abstract = {{The pharmaceutical industry is unique in its procedures and methods of
   manufacture, and thus requires a distinct project management approach.
   With the consideration of specific facility delivery processes of the
   industry, assessment of pharmaceutical construction project performance
   is required as a first step of improving their performance. To do so,
   industry-specific metrics tuned to the characteristics of the industry
   are developed, followed by establishment of a hierarchical structure
   enabling pharmaceutical projects to be properly grouped for performance
   assessment. Using collected data for producing metric values,
   descriptive and statistical analyses are performed to assess
   pharmaceutical project cost, schedule, and dimensional performances by
   three major types: bulk manufacturing, secondary manufacturing, and
   laboratory. By utilizing these industry-specific metrics and analyses
   results, the industry can find solutions to more effectively manage
   cost, schedule, and other resources for the delivery of pharmaceutical
   construction projects.}},

   simple cobalt treatment for improving the photoelectrochemical (PEC)
   performance of our N-modified TiO2 nanowire arrays. With the cobalt
   treatment, the IPCE of N-modified TiO2 samples in the ultraviolet region
   is restored to equal or higher values than those of the unmodified TiO2

Abstract = {{The spectrum deconvolution analysis tool (SDAT) software code was
   written and tested at The University of Texas at Austin utilizing the
   standard spectrum technique to determine activity levels of Xe-131m,
   Xe-133m, Xe-133, and Xe-135 in beta-gamma coincidence spectra. SDAT was
   originally written to utilize the method of least-squares to calculate
   the activity of each radionuclide component in the spectrum. Recently,
   maximum likelihood estimation was also incorporated into the SDAT tool.
   This is a robust statistical technique to determine the parameters that
   maximize the Poisson distribution likelihood function of the sample
   data. In this case it is used to parameterize the activity level of each
   of the radioxenon components in the spectra. A new test dataset was
   constructed utilizing Xe-131m placed on a Xe-133 background to compare
   the robustness of the least-squares and maximum likelihood estimation
   methods for low counting statistics data. The Xe-131m spectra were
   collected independently from the Xe-133 spectra and added to generate
   the spectra in the test dataset. The true independent counts of Xe-131m
   and Xe-133 are known, as they were calculated before the spectra were
   added together. Spectra with both high and low counting statistics are
   analyzed. Studies are also performed by analyzing only the 30 key X-ray
   region of the beta-gamma coincidence spectra. Results show that maximum
   likelihood estimation slightly outperforms least-squares for low
   counting statistics data. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Subnetwork analysis is often used in traffic assignment problems to
   reduce the size of the network being analyzed, with a corresponding
   decrease in computation time. This is particularly important in network
   design, second-best pricing, or other bilevel problems in which many
   equilibrium runs must be solved as a subproblem to a master optimization
   program. A fixed trip table based on an equilibrium path flow solution
   is often used, but this ignores important attraction and diversion
   effects as drivers (globally) change routes in response to (local)
   subnetwork changes. This paper presents an approach for replacing a
   regional network with a smaller one, containing all of the subnetwork,
   and zones. Artificial arcs are created to represent ``all paths{''}
   between each origin and subnetwork boundary node, under the assumption
   that the set of equilibrium routes does not change. The primary
   contribution of the paper is a procedure for estimating a cost function
   on these artificial arcs, using derivatives of the equilibrium travel
   times between the end nodes to create a Taylor series. A bush-based
   representation allows rapid calculation of these derivatives. Two
   methods for calculating these derivatives are presented, one based on
   network transformations and resembling techniques used in the analysis
   of resistive circuits, and another based on iterated solution of a
   nested set of linear equations. These methods are applied to two
   networks, one small and artificial, and the other a regional network
   representing the Austin, Texas metropolitan area. These demonstrations
   show substantial improvement in accuracy as compared to using a fixed
   table, and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2011

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a reformulation of count models as a special case of
   generalized ordered-response models in which a single latent continuous
   variable is partitioned into mutually exclusive intervals. Using this
   equivalent latent variable-based generalized ordered response framework
   for count data models, we are then able to gainfully and efficiently
   introduce temporal and spatial dependencies through the latent
   continuous variables. Our formulation also allows handling excess zeros
   in correlated count data, a phenomenon that is commonly found in
   practice. A composite marginal likelihood inference approach is used to
   estimate model parameters. The modeling framework is applied to predict
   crash frequency at urban intersections in Arlington, Texas. The sample
   is drawn from the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) crash
   incident files between 2003 and 2009, resulting in 1190
   intersection-year observations. The results reveal the presence of
   intersection-specific time-invariant unobserved components influencing
   crash propensity and a spatial lag structure to characterize spatial
   dependence. Roadway configuration, approach roadway functional types,
   traffic control type, total daily entering traffic volumes and the split
   of volumes between approaches are all important variables in determining
   crash frequency at intersections. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Calcium sulfoaluminate-belite (CSAB) cements are promoted as sustainable
   alternatives to portland cement because of their lower energy and CO(2)
   emissions during production and comparable performance. However, the
   formation of ettringite, the main hydration product in CSAB cements, can
   be expansive, sometimes resulting in cracking. The factors controlling
   expansive behavior in CSAB cements have not been completely elucidated.
   In this study, three CSAB cements synthesized from reagent-grade
   chemicals with varied phase compositions were examined for dimensional
   stability in water and sulfate solutions. The interdependent effects of
   C(4)A(3)(S) over cap (Ye'elimite) content, calcium sulfate content,
   water-to-cement ratio, and particle fineness on CSAB cement expansion
   were evaluated. The results show that the expansive behavior can be

   ``enhanced{''} solutions, which are based on the concept of enrichment
   of the original B-spline basis by means of the ``pure{''} k-refinement
   procedure typical of isogeometric analysis. We provide several numerical
   examples for linear and nonlinear output functionals, corresponding to
   the rotation, displacements and strain energy of the rod, and we compare
   the effectiveness of the proposed error estimators.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of optimal data collection to efficiently learn the model
   parameters of a graphite nitridation experiment is studied in the
   context of Bayesian analysis using both synthetic and real experimental
   data. The paper emphasizes that the optimal design can be obtained as a
   result of an information theoretic sensitivity analysis. Thus, the
   preferred design is where the statistical dependence between the model
   parameters and observables is the highest possible. In this paper, the
   statistical dependence between random variables is quantified by mutual
   information and estimated using a k nearest neighbor based
   approximation. It is shown, that by monitoring the inference process via
   measures such as entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, one can
   determine when to stop the data collection process. The methodology is
   applied to select the most informative designs on both a simulated data
   set and on an experimental data set, previously published in the
   literature. It is also shown that the sequential Bayesian analysis used
   in the experimental design can also be useful in detecting conflicting
   information between measurements and model predictions. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A significant portion of the energy dissipated in modern integrated
   circuits is consumed by the overhead associated with timing guardbands
   that ensure reliable execution. Timing speculation. where the pipeline
   operates at an unsafe voltage with any rare errors detected and
   resolved. by the architecture. has been demonstrated to significantly
   Improve the energy-efficiency of scalar processor designs.
   Unfortunately. applying the same timing-speculative approach to
   wide-SIMD architectures, such as those used in highly-efficient GPUs,
   may not provide similar gains.
   In this work. we make two important contributions. The first is a set of
   models describing a parametrized general error probability function that
   is based on measurements of a fabricated chip and the expected
   efficiency benefit of timing speculation in a SIMD context. The second
   contribution is a decoupled SIMD pipeline that more effectively utilizes
   timing speculation and recovery, when compared with a standard SIMD
   design that uses only conventional timing speculation. The proposed lane
   decoupling enables each SIMD lane to tolerate timing errors independent
   of other adjacent lanes, resulting in higher throughput and improved
   scalability. We validate our models and evaluate our design using a
   cycle-based GPU simulator. describe the conditions where efficiency
   improvements can be obtained. and explore the benefits of decoupling
   across a wide range of parameters. Our results show that timing
   speculation can achieve up to 10.3\% improvement in efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Shift-map codes have been studied as joint source-channel codes for
   continuous sources. These codes are useful in delay-limited scenarios
   and also provide better tolerance to deviations of the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) from a target SNR, compared to separate source and channel
   coding. This paper defines a generalized family of shift-map codes that
   share a strong connection with redundant residue number systems (RRNS),
   and are henceforth called RRNS-map codes.
   In the proposed coding scheme, side information about the source allows
   the decoder to consider only a fraction of the codebook for decoding,
   with no change in the encoding process. With an appropriately designed
   RRNS-map code, in this fraction of the codebook, the codewords are much
   better separated than the original codebook. As a result, RRNS-map codes
   achieve the same distortion in the mean square error sense as
   conventional shift-map codes without side information, but significantly
   outperform shift-map codes when side information is provided to the
   decoder. This coding scheme is ideally suited to applications where a
   simple and fixed encoding scheme is desired at the encoder, while the
   decoder is given access to side information about the source.}},

Abstract = {{This paper looks at online load balancing, in a setting where each job
   can only be served by a subset of the servers. The subsets are revealed
   only on arrival, and can be arbitrary. The cost of an allocation is the
   sum of cost for each server, which in turn is a convex increasing
   function of the number of jobs allocated to it. There are no departures.
   A natural class of policies are those which always put a job into one of
   its servers that has the least load at the time of arrival. However, it
   turns out that not all (randomized) ways of breaking ties is the same.
   We propose an algorithm - TIERED RANKING - that breaks ties in a very
   particular, correlated random way; it is inspired by the online matching
   work of Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani. We show that it is optimal (in
   terms of competitive ratio) in the above class, for all convex cost
   functions that grow slower than e(x) (which includes all l(p) norms). We
   also prove it strictly outperforms any deterministic algorithm;
   simulations show that it also visibly outperforms the naive randomized
   algorithm, that breaks ties among lowest-loaded servers uniformly at
   random.}},

Abstract = {{The history of infections and epidemics holds famous examples where
   understanding, containing and ultimately treating an outbreak began with
   understanding its mode of spread. The key question then, is: which
   network of interactions is the main cause of the spread? And can we
   determine the causative network without any knowledge of the epidemic,
   other than the identify of a minuscule subsample of infected nodes? This
   comes down to understanding the diagnostic power of network information.
   Specifically, in this paper we consider an epidemic that spreads on one
   of two networks. At some point in time, we see a small random subsample
   (perhaps a vanishingly small fraction) of those infected. We derive
   sufficient conditions two networks must have for this problem to be
   identifiable. We provide an efficient algorithm that solves the
   hypothesis testing problem on such graphs, and we characterize a regime
   in which our algorithm succeeds. Finally, we show that the condition we
   need for this identifiability property is fairly mild, and in
   particular, is satisfied by two common graph topologies: the grid, and
   the Erdos-Renyi graphs.}},

Abstract = {{Channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) aids interference
   management in many communication systems. Due to channel state
   information (CSI) feedback delay and time-variation in the wireless
   channel, perfect CSIT is not realistic. In this paper, the CSI feedback
   delay-DoF gain trade-off is characterized for the multi-user vector
   broadcast channel. A major insight is that it is possible to achieve the
   optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) gain if the delay is less than a
   certain fraction of the channel coherence time. This precisely
   characterizes the intuition that a small delay should be negligeable. To
   show this, a new transmission method called space-time interference
   alignment is proposed, which actively exploits both the current and past

Abstract = {{This paper develops two new greedy algorithms for learning the Markov
   graph of discrete probability distributions, from samples thereof. For
   finding the neighborhood of a node (i.e. variable), the simple, naive
   greedy algorithm iteratively adds the new node that gives the biggest
   improvement in prediction performance over the existing set. While fast
   to implement, this can yield incorrect graphs when there are many short
   cycles, as now the single node that gives the best prediction can be
   outside the neighborhood.
   Our new algorithms get around this in two different ways. The
   forward-backward greedy algorithm includes a deletion step, which goes
   back and prunes incorrect nodes that may have initially been added. The
   recursive greedy algorithm uses forward steps in a two-level process,
   running greedy iterations in an inner loop, but only including the final
   node. We show, both analytically and empirically, that these algorithms
   can learn graphs with small girth which other algorithms - both greedy,
   and those based on convex optimization - cannot.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial ability is a skill necessary in a number of disciplines,
   particularly in engineering education, the focus of this research. This
   study reviewed literature regarding the development of spatial ability
   and considered possible implications not only for engineering education
   but also for mathematics education, with specific regard to geometry.
   The focus of this study was to observe the differences in spatial
   ability among high school students in PreAP Geometry and students in an
   Introduction to Engineering Design course. We hypothesized that the
   students who were enrolled in both courses would have better spatial
   ability skills than those students who are solely enrolled in the
   geometry course.
   Of the 207 students enrolled in geometry at the test school, there was a
   smaller population (n=57) simultaneously enrolled in an engineering
   graphics course. No direct or special intervention was given to either
   group of students; however, the curriculum between the two classes
   differed greatly. Near the end of the academic year all students were
   administered the Purdue Visualization of Rotations test (ROT). Results
   showed that students enrolled in the engineering design class performed
   better than those students not enrolled in the course. Furthermore, the
   males outperformed the females when all students were considered.
   However, there was not a significant difference among the males, nor was
   there a difference between males and females within engineering. Further
   research is needed to understand these particular differences and to
   determine how geometry education plays a role in the development of
   spatial ability.}},

Abstract = {{Prototyping is an initial instantiation of a concept as part of the
   product development process. Prototypes serve numerous purposes both
   from a business and an engineering standpoint. Businesses use prototypes
   to gather detailed customer feedback on issues like aesthetics,
   ergonomics, and theme, as well as for marketing research and cost
   analysis. Prototyping is used by engineers to provide manufacturing and
   assembly data, to investigate system integration issues and to develop
   analysis and testing strategies. In some cases, prototyping is also used
   in the concept generation phase of the design process to assist
   designers to either expand or contract the set of possible concepts.
   Clearly prototyping is an important part of most design processes.
   We define the prototyping strategy as the set of decisions that dictate
   what actions will be taken to accomplish the development of the
   prototype( s). Prototyping strategies include a variety of different
   options. In the broadest sense, prototypes can be either physical or
   virtual. Virtual prototypes can include computer simulations and/or
   engineering analysis. Physical prototypes can be developed either for a
   subsystem or for the entire system. In addition, physical prototypes can
   be either full size or dimensionally scaled and can be either fully
   functional or be created to exhibit only partial functionality.
   Additional choices that are part of a prototyping strategy include
   whether one chooses to develop prototypes for a number of concepts in
   parallel and whether one plans to develop a sequence of prototypes of a
   concept. The choices made for the prototyping variables identified above
   can make tremendous differences in the time frame, cost and
   effectiveness of the prototyping work. However, very little research has
   been accomplished to identify how these variables should be chosen for a
   specific design project.
   In this paper we document an extensive literature review in the general
   area of prototyping. Prototyping strategies currently in use by a
   variety of different product developers are identified. When it is
   possible to identify either a business or engineering perspective, that
   perspective is noted. The wide variety of different prototyping
   strategies currently in use are identified and grouped into categories
   with similar characteristics. Specific differences in the prototyping
   strategies for business vs. engineering focused work are noted. Based on
   the literature review, the current state of the art for prototyping
   strategies is established. Of particular note is the fact that there is
   a dearth of information in the literature of how the decisions that
   determine a prototyping strategy are made. In light of this fact, an
   additional contribution of this paper is to hypothesize a set of
   characteristics of a design problem that can be used to optimize
   prototyping strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Calls for improving Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
   (STEM) education in the United States are well-known and
   well-publicized. This attention has led to efforts to introduce
   engineering in the K-12 grades. While K-12 schools are just beginning to
   offer courses in engineering, informal, afterschool programs that focus
   on engineering have been available for a number of years. However, the
   effects of these afterschool programs are not as easily documented and
   are therefore not well-studied.
   In this paper, we describe a novel afterschool engineering program
   targeted for middle school grades. The afterschool program builds on our
   many years of experience in conducting engineering-based professional
   development for K-12 teachers. The program is founded on a three-pronged
   approach of: 1) engaging students in inquiry-based learning
   opportunities that feature motivation of engineering concepts with
   readily-available technology examples, and team-based design projects
   with the National Academy of Engineering 21st Century Grand Challenges
   themes; 2) professional development and support for teachers to guide
   students in meaningful engineering design activities; and 3) informing
   parents and caregivers of the full range of STEM college and career
   pathway options so they can guide their students towards STEM-related
   educational choices.
   We have evaluated our afterschool program using student surveys
   administered in the fall and spring semesters (e.g., before and after
   the programs), and conducting more in-depth focus groups. The findings
   from the initial evaluation indicate that students in the target grades
   throughout the school district exhibited an increasingly positive
   attitude toward engineering and science-related careers. Likewise,
   teachers who participated in the program noted positive changes in
   themselves that they translated into strategies for teaching in their
   classrooms.}},

Abstract = {{In many cases, design involves adding and integrating additional
   functionality to an existing system. Often, such additions are
   accomplished by literally attaching a new component or set of components
   to the existing product. Examples include adding a protective cover to a
   cell phone, adding an electric starter system to a lawn mower or adding
   an energy harvesting system to a bridge or other existing infrastructure
   to provide power for lights or sensors. In many cases, we require that
   these ``add-on{''} systems interface with the existing system in a
   nondestructive manner. In some cases, the system should be not affected
   in any permanent fashion by the attachment. In other cases the
   requirement is that the system's primary functionality should not be
   degraded by the attachment.
   This paper reports on our work to develop a methodology that will assist
   designers, including students pursuing engineering degrees, in designing
   the means of an attachment of a new ( child) system onto an existing (
   parent) system. Based on a literature review of existing joining and
   attachment methods, we analyze Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving
   (TRIZ) principles that can be used to design nondestructive attachment
   methods. In developing the methodology, we performed an experiential
   study wherein several off-the-shelf products, patents, and biological
   systems encompassing a wide range of attachment methods were examined.
   Generalizable patterns from these products were identified and the
   distinguishing characteristics of each attachment method utilized to
   develop a foundation for the methodology. A matrix mapping the
   attachment methods and the system characteristics is presented as a
   design tool. Use of the tool is demonstrated through its application for
   attachment of a ``child{''} energy harvesting system to a ``parent{''}
   existing bridge for the purpose of powering a structural health
   monitoring system on the bridge.
   The effectiveness of the design tool was confirmed through the results
   of a design experiment where two groups of undergraduate senior
   engineering students at the US Air Force Academy were presented with a
   design problem. The control group did not use the new methodology while
   the experimental group did utilize this methodology to generate concept
   variants. The attachment concepts from the two groups were compared and
   analyzed with respect to a number of metrics. The experimental group
   produced a set of concepts that were higher in quantity, more feasible,
   and better met the design requirements when compared to the control
   group. The method should have particular applicability for student
   design teams where, due to the relatively short design timeline ( either
   1 or 2 semesters), it is common for the design problem to entail
   incorporating a ``child{''} system into an existing ``parent{''} system.
   The overall approach to this research and design-educational-ideation
   tool promises to inform similar approaches to educational research on
   innovation processes and students' innovation skill sets.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering design is a central concept driving our engineering
   curriculum and an integral component of the practice of engineering.
   Frequently, design concepts are not introduced in Biomedical Engineering
   at the university level until the last year of the undergraduate
   curriculum, generally in the form of a Senior Design course. Though
   students have been widely exposed to the scientific method, many reach
   their senior year in college surprised to find out that a design method
   also exists. Design is characterized by an iterative sequence of steps
   that involve identifying a need, defining the problem, developing
   solutions, evaluating solutions, and communicating results and
   recommendations. Seniors consistently requested, through exit surveys,
   introduction to design earlier in their academic experience.
   Furthermore, earlier introduction to design has also recently been
   recognized as a retention tool of engineering students(1) because they
   are able to understand the dynamic and creative nature of engineering, a
   topic often lost in the first two years of engineering.
   In order to provide early and consistent exposure to the engineering
   design process, we have implemented a design-based laboratory course
   featuring experiments in biomaterials design and drug delivery.
   Controlled drug delivery is an important application of biomedical
   engineering incorporating key aspects of mass transport, physiology, and
   biomaterials. This lab segment, which spanned five laboratory sections
   and four 1 hour lectures, led the students through the design,
   synthesis, and characterization of a particle-based matrix drug delivery
   device using ionically-crosslinked alginate spheres and several model
   drugs, fluorescein, tartrazine, erythrosin B, and bovine serum albumin.
   The experimental portion of the module included the synthesis of
   crosslinked alginate spheres of differing sizes, automated sizing of the
   spheres using microscopy and ImageJ, loading of a model drug into the
   spheres using equilibrium sorption or dispersed encapsulation, and the
   quantification of the dye release using absorbance on a UV/Vis plate
   reader. Students were evaluated by review of their laboratory notebooks,
   including methods, observations, calculations, and relevant plots.
   Additionally, assigned background research, which consisted of sourcing
   information from scientific literature and online resources, was
   recorded in the notebook.
   Ultimately, this course is an interesting approach to provide the
   first-year students an overview of what the biomedical engineering field
   encompasses by providing hands-on experience in several different areas
   of research and getting the students excited about their field of study.
   Analysis of course surveys revealed a significantly greater perceived

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) technology makes it possible to organize memories
   as cell arrays stacked on logic where upper die layers contain the cell
   arrays and the bottom layer implements the peripheral logic. This
   creates new degrees of freedom that can be exploited to optimize the use
   of spare rowslcolumns to maximize yield This paper proposes a new idea
   that exploits an additional degree of freedom that has not previously
   been utilized which is that the order of the die in the stack can be
   selected The cell array dies can be ordered with the one with the most
   defective cells at the lowest layer, followed by next most defective,
   and so forth finishing with the die with the fewest defective cells on
   the top layer. All the cell array dies have identical designs and are
   manufactured identically. However, the peripheral logic die is designed
   in a way where it costs less to provide repair on the lower layers than
   it does on the higher layers of the cell arrays. This is done by
   limiting the domain over which some spares can be used thereby reducing
   the number of fuses needed for configuring the spare. Results in the
   paper show that the ability to skew repair capability across the
   different layers in a 3DIC allows greater yield enhancement at lower
   cost both in terms of number of spares and number of fuses.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Sequence analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chain
   transcripts can refine categorization of B cell subpopulations and can
   shed light on the selective forces that act during immune responses or
   immune dysregulation, such as autoimmunity, allergy, and B cell
   malignancy. High-throughput sequencing yields Ig transcript collections
   of unprecedented size. The authoritative web based IMGT/HighV-QUEST
   program is capable of analyzing large collections of transcripts and
   provides annotated output files to describe many key properties of Ig
   transcripts. However, additional processing of these flat files is
   required to create figures, or to facilitate analysis of additional
   features and comparisons between sequence sets. We present an
   easy-to-use Microsoft Excel based software, named lmmunoglobulin
   AnalysisTool (IgAT), for the summary, interrogation, and further
   processing of IMGT/HighV-QUEST output files. IgAT generates descriptive
   statistics and high quality figures for collections of murine or human
   Ig heavy or light chain transcripts ranging from 1 to 150,000 sequences.
   In addition to traditionally studied properties of Ig transcripts such
   as the usage of germline gene segments, or the length and composition of
   the CDR-3 region IgAT also uses published algorithms to calculate the
   probability of antigen selection based on somatic mutational patterns,
   the average hydrophobicity of the antigen binding sites, and predictable
   structural properties of the CDR-H3 loop according to Shirai's H3-rules
   These refined analyses provide in-depth information about the selective
   forces acting upon Ig repertoires and allow the statistical and
   graphical comparison of two or more sequence sets. IgAT is easy to use
   on any computer running Excel 2003 or higher. Thus, IgAT is a useful
   tool to gain insights into the selective forces and functional
   properties of small to extremely large collections of Ig transcripts,
   thereby assisting a researcher to mine a data set to its fullest.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy and the use of chemotherapeutic agents have become routine

   delivery methods, particularly oral delivery. The oral delivery of
   chemotherapeutics could greatly change the common practice of using
   intravenous injections and ultimately provide improved patient care,
   comfort, reduction in healthcare costs, and reduction in side effects.
   We offer here a position paper on the importance of oral
   chemotherapeutic methods. We believe that using physiological cues and
   environments of the gastrointestinal tract and designing smart polymer
   carriers, the quest for oral drug delivery of chemotherapeutics may be
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{We present fabrication and characterization of wavelength selective
   germanium dielectric supported microbolometers using a self-alignment
   technique to help insure a flat microbolometer membrane. The fabricated
   microbolometer consists of a resistive absorber sheet on a quarter
   wavelength germanium layer above a half wavelength air gap, producing
   dielectric interference {[}1]. We use a self-aligned process without a
   polyimide patterning process that helps eliminate deformation and stress
   in the structure membrane. We demonstrated that the fabricated
   wavelength selective microbolometers have flat, robust membranes and
   produce excellent tunable narrowband absorption in MWIR/LWIR band with
   efficient multi-color IR spectral response using wavelength selective
   pixels.}},

Pages = {{221-233}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we review and discuss how nanoantennas may be used to
   largely enhance the nonlinear response of optical materials. For single
   nanoantennas, there have been tremendous advancements in understanding
   how to exploit the local field enhancement to boost the nonlinear
   susceptibility at the surface or sharp edges of plasmonic metals. After
   an overview of the work in this area, we discuss the possibility of
   controlling the optical nonlinear response using nanocircuit concepts
   and of significantly enhancing various nonlinear optical processes using
   planar arrays of plasmonic nanoantennas loaded with chi((2)) or chi((3))
   nonlinear optical materials, forming ultrathin, nanometer-scale
   nonlinear metasurfaces, as optical nanodevices. We describe how this
   concept may be used to boost the efficiency of nonlinear wave mixing and
   optical bistability, due to the large local field enhancement at the
   nonlinear nanoloads associated with the plasmonic features of suitably
   tailored nanoantenna designs. We finally discuss three exciting
   applications of the proposed nonlinear metasurface:
   dramatically-enhanced frequency conversion efficiency, efficient
   phase-conjugation for super-resolution imaging and large optical
   bistabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The retention of silica nanoparticles at water/crude oil interface is
   studied in this paper. Silica nanoparticles with two different surfaces
   (unmodified, surface modified with nonionic (PEG) surfactant) are used.
   Interfacial tension (IFT) measurements provide us the means to
   investigate the adsorption of silica nanoparticles at the crude
   oil/water interface. Unmodified nanoparticles do not change the IFT of
   crude oil/water interface. However, the presence of sulfonate or PEG
   modified nanoparticles in solution lower the IFT. We also carried out
   flow experiments with PEG modified silica nanoparticles through a glass
   bead pack. In the absence of crude oil, the nanoparticles act like a
   conservative tracer with insignificant interaction with the glass beads.
   This result is in agreement with our previous work on the adsorption of
   silica nanoparticles on mineral surfaces. However, at the residual oil
   saturation of 12\%, PEG modified silica nanoparticles are retained at
   crude oil/water interface, as shown by the concentration profile. These
   results are also in agreement with IFT and the contact angle
   measurements carried out in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Heat pipes have immense potential in the future of thermal management in
   electronic devices. As a passive device, they rely solely upon capillary
   forces to recirculate the coolant from the condenser to the evaporator
   via a wicking structure. In intermediate temperature heat pipes the
   limiting factor for heat removal is the capillary limit, which indicates
   the maximum recirculation rate that the capillary forces can induce.
   This capillary limit must be increased to allow heat pipes to remain a
   viable option for heat management within electronic devices. The aim of
   this work is to characterize and optimize the capillary limit of
   micropillared thermal wicks for heat pipe application in
   microelectronics cooling.
   Towards this goal, an analytical model, and a novel thermo-hydraulic
   experimental setup was developed. The analytical model of the
   micropillared array wicking structure provides a theoretical basis from
   which the pillar geometry and arrangement can be optimized. A capillary
   limit model was used to determine the geometric relationship between the
   pillar arrays and the maximum capillary flow rate through the wick. This
   model considers the effects of gravity and mass transfer due to
   evaporation.
   Finally, the thermo-hydraulic characterization setup, designed to
   minimize environmental losses, was used to experimentally determine the
   capillary limits of different silicon based micropillared wick samples.
   The heater and wicking structure were enclosed in a temperature and
   humidity controlled vacuum chamber The results obtained from this setup
   were used to validate the analytical model shown in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Passive joint compliance is a key feature of the human hand that plays
   an important role in realizing dexterous, precise and graceful
   movements. Our goal is to study the role of passive compliance in the
   human hand joints and develop ways for implementing human-like passive
   compliance in a robotic form. While a variety of factors influence joint
   stiffness in a tendon-driven system the focus of this paper is on
   investigating the effects of variation in moment arms, defined by the
   joint shape, on the joint stiffness characteristics. We present a method
   for analyzing the effects of variable moment arms on the joint stiffness
   variations and a mathematical technique to synthesize joint shapes based
   on the stiffness requirements. We study the role of variable passive
   stiffness by analyzing energy consumption and dynamic response with
   system models. We validate our theoretical results in shape synthesis
   with an experimental platform involving a single degree of freedom
   tendon driven joint. The analysis and results of our work have
   implications in the design of various robotic systems, including robotic
   hands, that seek to incorporate human-like joint stiffness
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Process control for vacuum arc remelting is a challenging and
   interesting problem that has captured the attention of the metallurgy
   and control communities for decades. The main goal of the process is the
   production of homogeneous ingots with an appropriate chemistry, physical
   size, and grain structure. Traditionally, this process has been
   controlled by applying a desired current to the furnace expecting to
   control the solidification profile and, therefore, the microstructure of
   the ingot. It is believed that the final ingot grain microstructure is
   strongly influenced by the molten metal pool profile. Thus, if pool
   profile was controlled during the melt then defect-free microstructures
   would be obtained. However, there was no controller capable of
   performing such a task. The recent development of a reduced-order model
   of solidification in vacuum arc remelting allowed the design of the
   first pool profile controller: A Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
   controller was designed to account for inaccuracies in the reduced-order
   model and the measurements. Simulation and experimental results show the
   accurate performance of the controller.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated building load-ground source heat pump model is developed
   in this paper to serve as a test bed for assessing the short- and
   long-term performance of GSHP and HGSHP systems with vertical boreholes.
   The model uses the Simulink/Matlab environment to take advantage of
   their built-in functionality, allowing for full coupling of the
   component building load, heat pump, ground loop, and supplemental heat
   rejection models at every time step The building load model uses the
   HAMBASE thermal program which can model residential and commercial
   buildings. The heat pump model uses available data provided by GSHP
   manufacturers and sensible heat corrections to accurately model
   operation across a wide range of input conditions. The vertical borehole
   ground loop model is based on Eskillsons g-function model, but includes
   a one-dimensional numerical model by Xu to calculate the short-term
   thermal response of the borehole and ground. The supplemental heat
   rejection section allows various techniques to be tested. The integrated
   model captures system performance over a wide range of time scales from
   seconds to 10-20 years. Results of a 15-year simulation are presented to
   illustrate the different time scale information that reveal the slow
   degradation in system performance due to the effects of ground heating.}},

Abstract = {{The intermittency of wind and solar power and the mismatch between when
   they are available and when demand is high have hindered the expansion
   of these two primary renewable resources. The goal of this research is
   to analyze an integrated energy system (named DSWiSS for dispatchable
   solar wind storage system) that includes a novel configuration of wind
   and solar together with compressed air energy storage (CABS) that is
   driven from excess nighttime wind energy and thermal storage energized
   by concentrated solar power in order to make these sources dispatchable
   during peak demand.
   This paper builds off prior published work for the DSWiSS configuration
   with an analysis of actual historical meteorological data for West Texas
   solar insolation, generation output data for a wind farm in West Texas,
   recorded electricity demand data of the Electric Reliability Council of
   Texas (ERCOT) grid, and historical temperature data for West Texas to
   assess system performance. In this analysis, a comparison approach was
   taken by optimizing both the operation of a conventional CAES facility
   that does not incorporate wind and solar directly and the operation of a
   CABS facility directly coupled to a wind farm, which will be referred to
   as CAES-plus-Wind. Dynamic parameters for wind generation, electricity
   price, and ambient temperature were utilized in the optimization models.
   Through the use of optimization models and the incorporation of a
   thermodynamic model of the CABS equipment, we found that in each season
   the electricity price is a key factor in determining whether the
   facility stores or generates energy. For the CAES equipment, the summer
   season yields the highest profits primarily because of the larger spread
   between highest and lowest daily price for electricity. Even though
   profits for the CABS equipment in the other seasons are small or
   negative, it appears that the value of the facility in the summer is
   greater than the costs in the other three seasons combined.
   Additionally, we found that the value of directly coupling the CABS
   facility to a wind farm versus operating the two entities separately
   yielded no significant increase in profits. Lastly, this analysis did
   not attempt to quantify the possible increase in wind farm generation
   output that could result from reduced curtailment with the use of an
   energy storage system such as is proposed in this paper. This additional
   source of revenue could be a major contributor to the economic
   justification for large scale energy storage.}},

Abstract = {{As the utility grid evolves to transmit information along with energy
   and water to the end-user, the traditional grid model is changing. The
   Pecan Street Smart Grid Demonstration Project in Austin, TX is at the
   leading edge of the evolution of the smart grid. Currently, over 100
   homes, soon to be 1,000, have electricity demand information being
   measured on a 15 second interval. Using the highly granular energy use
   and solar generation data from Pecan Street, we attempt to estimate the
   potential for small natural gas fuel cells as distributed firming power
   for intermittent renewables in the built environment. Micro-grids have
   traditionally relied on the macro-grid for stabilization in the event of
   local interruptions in generation. In this paper we analyze the utility,
   economic, and system efficiency impacts of small distributed natural gas
   fuel cells as an alternative to the macro-grid for stabilization. Using
   our unique dataset, we have determined that the average home could
   utilize a 5.5 kW fuel cell either for total generation or backup, and
   the average home could operate as its own micro-grid while not
   sacrificing core functionality. We also explore the utility of matching
   the thermal output of a possibly smaller fuel cell, used in combined
   heat and power mode (CHP), to an absorption refrigeration system in
   place of traditional space cooling. With these types of energy assets,
   homes could possibly participate with local electricity markets, or the
   grid at large, in a highly dynamic way. A home energy network could,
   given homeowner set-points, adjust home uses of energy and sell high
   priced electricity, back to the grid, possibly from both solar PV and
   fuel cell production, possibly eliminating energy bills. Lastly, we
   estimate that the system efficiency could possibly double by
   transporting natural gas to the end user to be converted into
   electricity and hot water as compared with traditional methods of using
   natural gas for power generation followed by electricity delivery.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a data management scheme for the Pecan Street smart
   grid demonstration project in Austin, Texas. In this project, highly
   granular data with 15-second resolution on resource generation and
   consumption, including total consumption of electricity, water, and
   natural gas and solar generation, are collected for more than 100 homes.
   Furthermore, this testbed, see Figure 1, of homes represents the
   nation's highest density of rooftop solar PV and electric vehicles, and
   includes a substantial subset of homes that are highly instrumented with
   meters on up to 6 sub-circuits in addition to the whole-home meter.
   Consequently, this demonstration project generates a one-of-a-kind
   dataset with excellent temporal and geographic fidelity.
   One consequence of this extensive dataset is that there are hundreds of
   parallel data streams that need to be remotely (wirelessly) collected,
   filtered, processed, managed, stored and analyzed to be useful for
   researchers. Cumulatively, they represent 100s of gigabytes of data
   after just a few months of collection, which represents a formidable
   barrier to conducting research.
   In partnership with the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), which is
   an NSF-sponsored cluster of supercomputers at UT-Austin, a data
   collection and management scheme has been developed. For storing the
   data, we have built a single column oriented database that so far has
   shown tremendous performance benefits. This paper shows the data schema,
   an example of MySQL query, and a developed program for rapid and
   automated

   data extraction, analysis and display. We expect that the findings of
   this work will be beneficial to researchers interested in grid-scale
   data management.}},

   residential electric water heaters. However, 1,380 trillion BTUs of
   primary energy was required to produce this retail electric power at the
   power station, indicating that electricity generation is much less
   efficient than directly burning fuels for water heating.
   This study analyzes 2010 baseline primary energy consumption for water
   heating in the US by considering energy conversions and end-use
   efficiencies in the residential and commercial sectors. In order to
   assess more energy and carbon-efficient means of heating water, we
   defined four additional scenarios in order to quantify potential energy
   savings by replacing electric water heaters with more efficient,
   commercially available technologies. The scenarios ranged in scope and
   technology deployment, and resulted in energy savings of 10-25\% and
   carbon dioxide emission reductions of 10-20\%. Although future
   deployment of water heating technologies is not likely to replicate any
   specific scenario, the conclusions drawn from this study are useful in
   guiding policy incentives and consumer behavior in regards to choosing
   between water heating technologies.}},

Abstract = {{It is critical for principal bearing stiffness for actuators to be
   evaluated for robot applications. The bearing stiffness calculation can
   be obtained from Hertzian contact theory. From a design standpoint,
   given the bearing stiffness, the target stiffness of the actuator shell
   structure and output plate may be an order higher than that of the
   principal bearing. This paper evaluates and compares the relationship
   between the stiffness of the shell structure and principal bearing as
   well as between the stiffness of the output-plate and principal bearing.
   The principal bearing for the actuator could be the crossed roller
   bearing (CRB), four-point bearing (FPB), or a tapered roller bearing
   (TRB) because they best accommodate the combined radial, axial, and
   moment loads. Also, the bearing weight and assembled weight (shell
   structure + principal bearing + output-plate) required to obtain
   appropriate stiffness can be evaluated based on the stiffness of these
   adjacent structures which hold the principal bearing. Finally, the
   shortest possible force path passing through the principal bearing from
   the shell to the output plate makes it possible to maximize actuator
   stiffness and reduces other negative effects.}},

Abstract = {{A new method of decomposing 3D solid models for use in automated
   manufacturing process planning applications is presented in this paper.
   The resulting algorithm, which is implemented and interacts with a
   larger suite of planning tools, is based on dividing complex volumes
   into convex sub-volumes. In order to ensure that the resulting convex
   sub-volumes are compact and feasible for machining operations, a set of
   heuristics are developed to categorize, order, and determine splitting
   directions of the concave edges. Each of the resulting convex
   sub-volumes represents material that is to be removed from the
   bounding-box to create the intended workpiece. The set of sub-volumes
   represents a compound solid (i.e. decomposed solid) that is converted
   into graph of boundary representation (B-rep) primitives and is reasoned
   about in a subsequent search process. The algorithm has been implemented
   and tested on a variety of solid models resembling real automotive
   parts, and results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In any manufacturing setting, producing a machined part is a
   complicated, multi-step process. It. requires coordination between an
   engineer and a machinist to ensure all goals are met. A machinist
   creates a part based generally on personal experience and intuition, and
   while they know that this will result in the finished product, it is not
   guaranteed that the process plan chosen is the quickest or least
   expensive way to make the part. In the past year we have been developing
   an automated tool that analyzes a solid model to determine its best
   process plan. The tool is essentially comprised of a reasoning engine
   that determines what processes. are valid for particular sections of the
   part, and an evaluation engine that estimates the time and cost of the
   candidate processes.
   This paper presents the implemented evaluation engine, which assigns
   individual values of time and cost to machine operations. The evaluation
   starts with an automated tool selection strategy. The engineering model
   is able to determine the machining time of the tool(s) chosen. The
   method presented here takes a unique approach to machining time
   estimation that balances the trade-off between accuracy and
   computational time. Preliminary results suggest that the method is able
   to achieve accuracy near that of commercial CAM packages, with a much
   lower computational expense. The evaluation model takes into account
   non-productive manufacturing times (e.g. fixturing, inspection), and
   translates these to related costs. The method will be presented and
   discussed in this paper along with some preliminary results. Approved

Abstract = {{This paper presents an implementation of kinematic analysis to evaluate
   planar mechanisms for use in an automated design process. The existing
   software available for kinematic analysis require the user to manually
   input the mechanism for analysis. But in order to computationally
   synthesize planar mechanisms, it is important to automatically define
   the boundary conditions and adjust the necessary parameters to evaluate
   the kinematics of the mechanism in consideration. Currently, there are
   no kinematic analysis tools available that can be integrated with a
   design generation tool. One of the reasons is the absence of a method
   which not only solves the kinematics reliably but is also applicable to
   generalized n-bar mechanisms. The authors have implemented the instant
   center method for solving velocities, the vector polygon approach for
   solving accelerations and the dyadic decomposition method for solving
   positions. This implementation operates on n-bar mechanisms consisting
   of four-bar loops and one-degree of freedom on revolute (R), prismatic
   (P) and revolute-prismatic (R-P) joints. The developed method takes
   advantage of the concepts in object oriented programming as well as a
   unique representation based on graph-grammar formalism. This paper
   describes the methodology used for generalizing kinematic analysis for
   integration with a concept generator along with examples to validate the
   implementation.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-63}},

Abstract = {{Commercial sterilization of medical devices may be performed using
   electron beam irradiators at various electron energies. The potential
   for activating components of the devices has been discussed, with
   current standards stating that electron energy greater than 10 MeV
   requires assessment of potential induced radioactivity. This paper
   evaluates the potential for induced activity in medical products
   sterilized in electron beam as a function of the electron maximum
   energy. Monte Carlo simulation of a surrogate medical device was used to
   calculate photon and neutron fields resulting from electron irradiation,
   which were used to calculate concentrations for several radionuclides.
   The experiments confirmed that 10 MeV is a conservative assumption for
   limiting induced radioactivity. However, under the conditions as
   evaluated, which is a limited total quantity of metal in the material
   being irradiated and absent a limited number of elements; the amount of
   induced activity at 12 MeV could also be considered insignificant. The
   comparison of the sum-of-fractions to the US Nuclear Regulatory
   Commission exempt concentration limits is less than unity for all
   energies below 12.1 MeV, which suggests that there is minimal
   probability of significant induced activity at energies above the 10 MeV
   upper energy limit. (C) 201 1 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{140-148}},
Abstract = {{We use fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking velocimetry to
   image the motion of concentrated emulsions and microgel suspensions near
   solid surfaces. The local deformation involves a combination of slip and
   bulk flow, which are found to be controlled by surface forces. With
   smooth surfaces, two slip mechanisms are identified depending on whether
   particle-wall interactions are repulsive or weakly attractive. In the
   former case, the materials yield uniformly and the local rheology can be
   mapped on the macroscopic flow curve. In the latter case, yielding is
   non-uniform which reveals a continuous distribution of states from the
   immediate vicinity of the smooth surface to the bulk of the material.
   The effect of the surface is long-ranged and decays exponentially with
   the distance, which can be described by a non-local fluidity model. Our
   results establish a link between surface forces, lubrication and
   yielding in soft glassy or jammed materials and open new routes to
   manipulate their flow through the surface chemistry of the confining
   boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{We consider two desired properties of learning algorithms: sparsity and
   algorithmic stability. Both properties are believed to lead to good
   generalization ability. We show that these two properties are
   fundamentally at odds with each other: A sparse algorithm cannot be
   stable and vice versa. Thus, one has to trade off sparsity and stability
   in designing a learning algorithm. In particular, our general result
   implies that l(1)-regularized regression (Lasso) cannot be stable, while
   l(2)-regularized regression is known to have strong stability properties
   and is therefore not sparse.}},

Abstract = {{Substitution of B for Ti in Li1+xTi2+xBx(PO4)(3) introduces x mobile Li+
   ions per formula unit in the solid-station range 0 < x <= 0.2. The B2O3

   size. With x = 0.2, the room-temperature Li+-ion conductivity is
   sigma(Li) = 2.0 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) with a motional activation energy of
   0.48 eV. For x > 0.2, an intergranular B2O3-rich second phase impedes

Title = {{Explicit cross-link relations between effective elastic modulus and

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{353-359}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Explicit cross-link relations between effective elastic modulus and
   thermal conductivity for composites with different fiber orientation are
   derived with help of Mori-Tanaka micromechanical method. Numerical
   cross-link relations are also established by digital-image-based finite
   element method, and they compare favorably with the analytical
   cross-link relations especially for the composite with aligned fibers
   and planar randomly oriented fibers. Both analytical and numerical
   cross-link relations agree well with the experimental results available
   in the literature. For the composite with space randomly oriented
   fibers, the numerically obtained cross-link relations are insensitive to
   the fiber's shape, and the analytical cross-link relations are weakly
   dependent on fiber's shape. In sum, the sensitivity of cross-link
   relations to the fiber's shape depends on the extent of anisotropic
   behavior of fiber composites. Such cross-link relations can be
   potentially applied for predicting the difficult-to-measure elastic
   modulus from the measured thermal conductivities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
