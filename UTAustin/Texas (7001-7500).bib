Title = {{Numerical Algorithms for Network Modeling of Yield Stress and other
   Non-Newtonian Fluids in Porous Media}},

Abstract = {{Many applications involve the flow of non-Newtonian fluids in porous,
   subsurface media including polymer flooding in enhanced oil recovery,
   proppant suspension in hydraulic fracturing, and the recovery of heavy
   oils. Network modeling of these flows has become the popular pore-scale
   approach for understanding first-principles flow behavior, but strong
   nonlinearities have prevented larger-scale modeling and more
   time-dependent simulations. We investigate numerical approaches to
   solving these nonlinear problems and show that the method of fixed-point
   iteration may diverge for shear-thinning fluids unless sufficient
   relaxation is used. It is also found that the optimal relaxation factor
   is exactly equal to the shear-thinning index for power-law fluids. When
   the optimal relaxation factor is employed it slightly outperforms
   Newton's method for power-law fluids. Newton-Raphson is a more efficient
   choice (than the commonly used fixed-point iteration) for solving the
   systems of equations associated with a yield stress. It is shown that
   iterative improvement of the guess values can improve convergence and
   speed of the solution. We also develop a new Newton algorithm (Variable
   Jacobian Method) for yield-stress flow which is orders of magnitude
   faster than either fixed-point iteration or the traditional Newton's
   method. Recent publications have suggested that minimum-path search
   algorithms for determining the threshold pressure gradient (e.g.,
   invasion percolation with memory) greatly underestimate the true
   threshold gradient when compared to numerical solution of the flow
   equations. We compare the two approaches and reach the conclusion that
   this is incorrect; the threshold gradient obtained numerically is
   exactly the same as that found through a search of the minimum path of
   throat mobilization pressure drops. This fact can be proven
   mathematically; mass conservation is only preserved if the true
   threshold gradient is equal to that found by search algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying wind power variability is essential to power system
   operators, since wind power variability has a significant effect on the
   system operating reserve requirements and an underestimation of these
   requirements can severely affect the reliability of the system.
   Moreover, quantifying wind power variability, regardless of its
   uncertainty, can provide important characteristics generators must have
   so as to accommodate wind power fluctuations. The objective of this
   paper is to provide a metric to quantify short-term wind power
   variability. The general idea lies in comparing and quantifying the
   variability of a source using its range of outputs over a given period,
   conditioned on certain influential variables. The proposed conditional
   range metric (CRM) can be thought of as an ``interval estimation{''} of
   the wind power over a given length time interval and can be used in
   conjunction with state-of-the-art forecasting as a valuable input in
   enhancing decision making under uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological analysis is an essential step in verifying the success of
   a tissue engineering strategy where the presence of a desired cellular
   phenotype must be determined. While morphometry has transitioned from
   observational grading to computational quantification, established
   quantitative methods eliminate information by relying on two-dimensional
   (2D) analysis to describe three-dimensional (3D) niches. In this study,
   we demonstrate the validity and utility of 3D morphological
   quantification using two common angiogenesis assays in our fibrin-based
   in vitro model: (1) the microcarrier bead assay with human mesenchymal
   stem cells and (2) the rat aortic ring outgrowth assay. The
   quantification method is based on collecting and segmenting fluorescent
   confocal z-stacks into 3D models with 3D Slicer, an open-source magnetic
   resonance imaging/computed tomography analysis program. Data from 3D
   models are then processed into biologically relevant metrics in MATLAB
   for statistical analysis. Metrics include descriptive parameters such as
   vascular network length, volume, number of network segments, and degree
   of network branching. Our results indicate that 2D measures are
   significantly different than their 3D counterparts unless the vascular
   network exhibits anisotropic growth along the plane of imaging.
   Additionally, the statistical outcomes of 3D morphological
   quantification agreed with our initial qualitative observations among
   different test groups. This novel quantification approach generates more
   spatially accurate and objective measures, representing an important
   step toward improving the reliability of morphological comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{We give numerical calculations of periodic orbits in the planar
   concentric restricted four-body problem. It is assumed that the motion
   of a massless body is governed by three primaries m(1), m(2) and m(3).
   We suppose that m(1) >> m(2), m(3) and that, in an m(1) centered
   inertial reference frame, m(2) and m(3) move in different circles about
   m(1) and m(1) is fixed. Although the motion of the primaries m(1), m(2).
   m(3) does not satisfy Newton's equations of motion, this approximation
   is a good to model, for instance, the Jupiter-Europa-Ganymede-spacecraft
   system. We compute periodic orbits in both the m(1)-m(2) and m(1)-m(3)
   rotating frames. Periodic orbits that orbit around one of the primaries
   are found. Using a method that is based on the well-known Laplace
   resonance we also find unstable periodic orbits about the collinear
   libration points near m(2) and m(3). Since the periodic orbits near the
   collinear libration points are unstable they have stable/unstable
   manifolds, which we compute. We observe a lack of intersection of the
   stable and unstable manifolds of different periodic orbits. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Multiple-discrete continuous choice models formulated and applied in
   recent years consider a single linear resource constraint, which, when
   combined with consumer preferences, determines the optimal consumption
   point. However, in reality, consumers face multiple resource constraints
   such as those associated with time, money, and capacity. Ignoring such
   multiple constraints and instead using a single constraint can, and in
   general will, lead to poor data fit and inconsistent preference
   estimation, which can then have a serious negative downstream effect on
   forecasting and welfare/policy analysis.
   In this paper, we extend the multiple-discrete continuous extreme value
   (MDCEV) model to accommodate multiple constraints. The formulation uses
   a flexible and general utility function form, and is applicable to the
   case of complete demand systems as well as incomplete demand systems.
   The proposed MC-MDCEV model is applied to time-use decisions, where
   individuals are assumed to maximize their utility from time-use in one
   or more activities subject to monetary and time availability
   constraints. The sample for the empirical exercise is generated by
   combining time-use information from the 2008 American Time Use Survey
   and expenditure records from the 2008 US Consumer Expenditure Survey.
   The estimation results show that preferences can get severely
   mis-estimated, and the data fit can degrade substantially, when only a
   subset of active resource constraints is used. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{97}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The study described in this paper aims at quantifying the long-term
   aging effects on the rheological properties of warm mix asphalt (WMA)
   binders. Under the scope of this study, the authors focused on four warm
   mix asphalt additives: Sasobit, Rediset, Cecabase and Evotherm, of which
   the first one is an organic and the latter three are synthetic
   additives. The rheology of the aforementioned additives added to a PG
   64-22 binder were studied using a frequency sweep test performed over a
   range of ten different loading frequencies and three different
   temperatures with different degrees of exposure to oxidative aging.
   The paper proposes a more efficient methodology for developing master
   curves for asphaltic materials based on joint estimation of the model
   parameters that eliminates any possible propagation of biases from one
   model to the other. The developed master curves accommodate the
   simultaneous quantification of the effect of loading time, temperature
   and aging on the rheological properties of the WMA binder.
   The paper finally addresses the effect of aging on different WMA
   binders. Results indicated that the Rediset WMA binder had the lowest
   shear modulus, followed by the Evotherm, Cecabase and Sasobit WMA
   binders. However, a different rate of gain trend was observed in the
   modulus values where, again, Rediset was slowest of all but followed by
   Sasobit, Evotherm and Cecabase binders. This implies that, of all the
   binders investigated in this study, the Sasobit WMA binder will have a
   significantly lower modulus over time as compared to the control PG
   64-22 binder and the Rediset WMA binder will have the lowest modulus in
   the short-term as well as over time. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{For real-time video broadcast where multiple users are interested in the
   same content, mobile-to-mobile cooperation can be utilized to improve
   delivery efficiency and reduce network utilization. Under such
   cooperation, however, real-time video transmission requires end-to-end
   delay bounds. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of wireless fading
   channels, deterministic delay bounds are prohibitively difficult to
   guarantee. For a scalable video structure, an alternative is to provide
   statistical guarantees using the concept of effective capacity/bandwidth
   by deriving quality of service exponents for each video layer. Using
   this concept, we formulate the resource allocation problem for general
   multihop multicast network flows and derive the optimal solution that
   minimizes the total energy consumption while guaranteeing a statistical
   end-to-end delay bound on each network path. A method is described to
   compute the optimal resource allocation at each node in a distributed
   fashion. Furthermore, we propose low complexity approximation algorithms
   for energy-efficient flow selection from the set of directed acyclic
   graphs forming the candidate network flows. The flow selection and
   resource allocation process is adapted for each video frame according to
   the channel conditions on the network links. Considering different
   network topologies, results demonstrate that the proposed resource
   allocation and flow selection algorithms provide notable performance
   gains with small optimality gaps at a low computational cost.}},

Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{The optimality of a low-energy Earth-Moon transfer terminating in
   ballistic capture is examined for the first time using primer vector
   theory. An optimal control problem is formed with the following free
   variables: the location, time, and magnitude of the transfer insertion
   burn, and the transfer time. A constraint is placed on the initial state
   of the spacecraft to bind it to a given initial orbit around a first
   body, and on the final state of the spacecraft to limit its Keplerian
   energy with respect to a second body. Optimal transfers in the system
   are shown to meet certain conditions placed on the primer vector and its
   time derivative. A two point boundary value problem containing these
   necessary conditions is created for use in targeting optimal transfers.
   The two point boundary value problem is then applied to the ballistic
   lunar capture problem, and an optimal trajectory is shown. Additionally,
   the problem is then modified to fix the time of transfer, allowing for
   optimal multi-impulse transfers. The tradeoff between transfer time and
   fuel cost is shown for Earth-Moon ballistic lunar capture transfers. (C)

Abstract = {{A 50-50wt.\% Ba2Co9O14 (BCO)+ Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) composite was
   evaluated as a cathode for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel
   cell (IT-SOFC) operating at 800 degrees C. The composite was supported
   on the electrolyte La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 (LSGM) and its
   performance for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) was evaluated with a
   symmetric BCO + SDC{[}LSGM]BCO + SDC cell, which gave a polarization
   resistance of 0.068 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C in air. A singe cell
   with a 300-mu m-thick electrolyte and a composite NiO+Gd-doped ceria
   anode gave a nearly stable P-max approximate to 450 mW cm(-2) at 800
   degrees C, indicating that with a thinner electrolyte, the composite
   cathode could provide an IT-SOFC that meets the targeted 500 mW cm(-2)
   at 800 degrees C. The fabrication of the composite cathode versus BCO
   alone serves two functions: improved adhesion to the electrolyte and an
   enhancement of the ORR activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Lateral structures have been used to characterize charge transport
   phenomena in organic bulk heterojunctions. Through the analysis of the
   current vs. voltage relationships and their light intensity dependence,
   space charge limited extraction currents and injection currents have
   been observed and characterized. Additionally, the drift length of
   charge carriers has been estimated by characterizing devices of varying
   lengths. These studies show that lateral structures are a promising way
   to study the basic physics of organic bulk heterojunction materials as
   they offer degrees of freedom unavailable in sandwich structures and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a multiscale mortar multipoint flux mixed
   finite element method for second order elliptic problems. The equations
   in the coarse elements (or subdomains) are discretized on a fine grid
   scale by a multipoint flux mixed finite element method that reduces to
   cell-centered finite differences on irregular grids. The subdomain grids
   do not have to match across the interfaces. Continuity of flux between
   coarse elements is imposed via a mortar finite element space on a coarse
   grid scale. With an appropriate choice of polynomial degree of the
   mortar space, we derive optimal order convergence on the fine scale for
   both the multiscale pressure and velocity, as well as the coarse scale
   mortar pressure. Some superconvergence results are also derived. The
   algebraic system is reduced via a non-overlapping domain decomposition
   to a coarse scale mortar interface problem that is solved using a
   multiscale flux basis. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm
   the theory and illustrate the efficiency and flexibility of the method.}},

Abstract = {{A series of sub-100 nm superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with
   amphiphilic poly(acrylic acid-b-butylacrylate); PAA-b-PBA) copolymer
   shells were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic
   light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and a superconducting quantum
   interference device (SQUID) to investigate the effect of the polymer
   structure on the interfacial tension for nanoparticles adsorbed at the
   dodecane-water interface. Large reductions in interfacial tension of up
   to 27.6 mN/m were measured at nanoparticle concentrations of 0.27 wt \%,
   indicating significant nanoparticle adsorption and interaction between
   the oil and water molecules at the interface. The adsorption energy of
   the polymer-coated nanoparticles at the dodecane/water interface was
   determined from the interfacial tension and nanoparticle radius, and
   analyzed in terms of the structure of the polymer stabilizer.
   Furthermore, the equilibrium adsorption of amphiphilic
   copolymer-functionalized iron oxide nanoclusters at the oil water
   interface was determined by material balance from the concentration in
   the excess water phase and the known overall oil/water interfacial area.
   The formation and stabilization of oil droplets were on the order of 10
   mu m in water with unusually low nanoparticle concentrations was
   explained in terms of the high interfacial activity of the particles.}},

Abstract = {{Natural biomaterials are well positioned to play a significant role in
   the development of the next generation of biomaterials for nervous
   system repair. These materials are derived from naturally occurring
   substances and are highly diverse and versatile. They are generally
   biocompatible and are well tolerated in vivo, and therefore have a high
   potential to be successful as part of clinical repair strategies in the
   nervous system. Here we review recent reports on acellular tissue
   grafts, collagen, hyaluronan, fibrin, and agarose in their use to repair

Abstract = {{Thermoresponsive shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a type of
   stimuli-sensitive materials that switch from a temporary shape back to
   their permanent shape upon exposure to heat. While the majority of SMPs
   have been fabricated in the solid form, porous SMP foams exhibit
   distinct properties and are better suited for certain applications,
   including some in the biomedical field. Like solid SMPs, SMP foams have
   been restricted to a limited group of organic polymer systems. In this
   study, we prepared inorganic organic SMP foams based on the
   photochemical cure of a macromer comprised of inorganic
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments and organic poly(E-caprolactone)
   (PCL) segments, diacrylated PCL40-block-PDMS37-block-PCL40. To achieve
   tunable pore size with high interconnectivity, the SMP foams were
   prepared via a refined solvent-casting/particulate-leaching (SCPL)
   method. By varying design parameters such as degree of salt fusion,
   macromer concentration in the solvent and salt particle size, the SMP
   foams with excellent shape memory behavior and tunable pore size, pore
   morphology, and modulus were obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{FaIMS: A fast algorithm for the inverse medium problem with multiple
   frequencies and multiple sources for the scalar Helmholtz equation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{231}},

Abstract = {{We propose an algorithm to compute an approximate singular value
   decomposition (SVD) of least-squares operators related to linearized
   inverse medium problems with multiple events. Such factorizations can be
   used to accelerate matrix-vector multiplications and to precondition
   iterative solvers.
   We describe the algorithm in the context of an inverse scattering
   problem for the low-frequency time-harmonic wave equation with broadband
   and multi-point illumination. This model finds many applications in
   science and engineering (e.g., seismic imaging, subsurface imaging,
   impedance tomography, non-destructive evaluation, and diffuse optical
   tomography).
   We consider small perturbations of the background medium and, by
   invoking the Born approximation, we obtain a linear least-squares
   problem. The scheme we describe in this paper constructs an approximate
   SVD of the Born operator (the operator in the linearized least-squares
   problem). The main feature of the method is that it can accelerate the
   application of the Born operator to a vector.
   If N-omega is the number of illumination frequencies, N-S the number of
   illumination locations, N-d the number of detectors, and N the
   discretization size of the medium perturbation, a dense singular value
   decomposition of the Born operator requires O(min(NSN omega Nd, N)](2) x
   max(NSN omega Nd, N)) operations. The application of the Born operator
   to a vector requires O(N omega NS mu(N)) work, where mu(N) is the cost
   of solving a forward scattering problem. We propose an approximate SVD
   method that, under certain conditions, reduces these work estimates
   significantly. For example, the asymptotic cost of factorizing and
   applying the Born operator becomes O(mu(N)N-omega). We provide numerical
   results that demonstrate the scalability of the method. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The stability of gold nanorods (NRs) coated with amphiphilic ligands
   (ALs) was investigated. NRs coated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
   (CTAB) were ligand exchanged with polyoxyethylene {[}10] cetyl ether
   (Brij56), Oligofectamine (OF), and phosphatidylserine (PS). An
   aggregation index based on the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance
   peak broadening was used to measure stability of the NR-ALs under
   different conditions including the number of washes, pH, ionic
   concentration, and temperature. The aggregation index was also used to
   measure the stability of the NR-ALs under ultrafast laser irradiation
   and in the presence of proteins commonly used in cell culture.
   Differences in NR-AL stability were found, which were due to differences
   in the physical and chemical properties of the ALs. Apart from the
   charge on the AL headgroup, we suggest the Gibbs free energy of
   passivation (Delta G(p)) and enthalpy of passivation (Delta H-p) of the
   AL could potentially aid in the selection of amphiphiles that can
   effectively passivate NRs for stability and optimize their properties
   and desired biological impact.}},

Title = {{The Skp Chaperone Helps Fold Soluble Proteins in Vitro by Inhibiting

Abstract = {{The periplasmic seventeen kilodalton protein (Skp) chaperone has been
   characterized primarily for its role in outer membrane protein (OMP)
   biogenesis, during which the jellyfish-like trimeric protein
   encapsulates partially folded OMPs, protecting them from the aqueous
   environment until delivery to the BAM outer membrane protein insertion
   complex. However, Skp is increasingly recognized as a chaperone that
   also assists in folding soluble proteins in the bacterial periplasm. In
   this capacity, Skp coexpression increases the active yields of many
   recombinant proteins and bacterial virulence factors. Using a panel of
   single-chain antibodies and a single-chain T-cell receptor (collectively
   termed scFvs) possessing varying stabilities and biophysical
   characteristics, we performed in vivo expression and in vitro folding
   and aggregation assays in the presence or absence of Skp. For
   Skp-sensitive scFvs, the presence of Skp during in vitro refolding
   assays reduced aggregation but did not alter the observed folding rates,
   resulting in a higher overall yield of active protein. Of the proteins
   analyzed, Skp sensitivity in all assays correlated with the presence of
   folding intermediates, as observed with urea denaturation studies. These
   results are consistent with Skp acting as a holdase, sequestering
   partially folded intermediates and thereby preventing aggregation.
   Because not all soluble proteins are sensitive to Skp coexpression, we
   hypothesize that the presence of a long-lived protein folding
   intermediate renders a protein sensitive to Skp. Improved understanding
   of the bacterial periplasmic protein folding machinery may assist in
   high-level recombinant protein expression and may help identify novel
   approaches to block bacterial virulence.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to design and characterize uniform, bimetallic alloy
   nanoparticles, where the less active metal enhances the activity of the
   more active metal, would be of broad interest in catalysis. Herein, we
   demonstrate that simultaneous reduction of Ag and Pd precursors provides
   uniform, Ag-rich AgPd alloy nanoparticles (similar to 5 nm) with high
   activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media.
   The particles are crystalline and uniformly alloyed, as shown by X-ray
   diffraction and probe corrected scanning transmission electron
   microscopy. The ORR mass activity per total metal was 60\% higher for
   the AgPd2 alloy relative to pure Pd. The mass activities were 2.7 and
   3.2 times higher for Ag9Pd (340 mA/mg(metal)) and Ag4Pd (598
   mA/mg(metal)), respectively, than those expected for a linear
   combination of mass activities of Ag (60 mA/mg(Ag)) and Pd (799
   mA/mg(Pd)) particles, based on rotating disk voltammetry. Moreover,
   these synergy factors reached 5-fold on a Pd mass basis. For silver-rich
   alloys (Ag <= 4Pd), the particle surface is shown to contain single Pd
   atoms surrounded by Ag from cyclic voltammetry and CO stripping
   measurements. This morphology is favorable for the high activity through
   a combination of modified electronic structure, as shown by XPS, and
   ensemble effects, which facilitate the steps of oxygen bond breaking and
   desorption for the ORR. This concept of tuning the heteroatomic
   interactions on the surface of small nanoparticles with low
   concentrations of precious metals for high synergy in catalytic activity
   may be expected to be applicable to a wide variety of nanoalloys.}},

   beneficial effects of the Ce component in Pt-Sn-Ce/C for MOR, despite
   its low content. Electrochemical techniques such as COad stripping,
   linear scan, and derivative voltammetries along with electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were employed to analyze MOR on Pt-Sn-Ce/C
   and Pt-Sn/C from a mechanistic point of view. Accelerated durability
   test (ADT) and single cell test of Pt-Sn-Ce/C in comparison to a
   commercial PtRu/C catalyst demonstrate the superior performance of
   Pt-Sn-Ce/C from stability and activity points of view. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this work, we demonstrate that device characteristics could be

   nm HfO2, or 2 min treatment each in the middle and from the top of HfO2
   layer. Drive current (Id) and effective channel mobility could be
   improved by 70\% and 51\%, respectively, for devices with treatment both
   in the middle and from the top of HfO2 high kappa layer compared to
   those of devices without SF6 treatment. The impact of SF6 plasma

Abstract = {{We report a comprehensive high-pressure study on the triple-layer
   T-'-La4Ni3O8 with a suite of experimental probes, including structure
   determination, magnetic, and transport properties up to 50 GPa.
   Consistent with a recent ab inito calculation, application of
   hydrostatic pressure suppresses an insulator-metal spin-state transition
   at P-C approximate to 6 GPa. However, a low-spin metallic phase does not
   emerge after the high-spin state is suppressed to the lowest
   temperature. For P > 20 GPa, the ambient T-' structure transforms
   gradually to a T-dagger-type structure, which involves a structural
   reconstruction from fluorite La-O-2-La blocks under low pressures to
   rock-salt LaO-LaO blocks under high pressures. Absence of the metallic
   phase under pressure has been discussed in terms of local displacements
   of O(2-)ions in the fluorite block under pressure before a global
   T-dagger phase is established.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental salt and water transport properties of cellulose ester
   polymers have been studied and correlated with their hydrated free
   volume, as probed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS),
   to provide scientific insights for material development in seawater
   desalination. It has been found that the hydrated free volume is
   strongly dependent on water uptake. The water sorption in polymeric
   films reduces the fractional free volume (FFV) at low degrees of
   hydration due to the overwhelming hole-filling effect, but gradually
   increases FFV when more water sorption takes place as a result of the
   swelling effect. The diffusivity and permeability of both water and salt
   vary with changes in wet-state FFV. Diffusion selectivity of H2O/NaCl
   increases dramatically as the hydrated FFV decreases, while solubility
   selectivity of H2O/NaCl is dependent on both hydrated free volume and
   chemical structure. Moreover, thin freestanding films with no sub-layer
   support have been prepared by spin casting these polymers on silicon
   wafers for the purpose of eliminating internal concentration
   polarization (ICP) in the forward osmosis (FO) process. Based on the
   theoretical prediction from the solution-diffusion model, the
   performance ratio (i.e., the ratio of the experimental to theoretical
   water flux) of the sub-layer free films can be calculated. It can reach
   as high as around 50\%, which is 2-3 times of the values reported
   elsewhere when testing traditional asymmetric membranes. Using a model
   3.5 wt.\% NaCl feed solution and a 2M NaCl draw solution, a water flux
   of 21.8 LMH has been observed, which is the highest value ever reported.
   The high water flux in the FO desalination process indicates that the
   concept of sub-layer-free thin films is promising for the next
   generation FO membranes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of improved solar energy conversion materials is

   films exhibiting promising photoelectrochemical properties on both metal
   foils and fluorine-doped tin-oxide-coated glass slides using a
   single-source chemical spray pyrolysis technique. Their strong light
   absorption in the visible range and well-crystallized layered structure
   give rise to their excellent photoelectrochemical performance through
   improved electron-hole generation and separation. The structure and
   surface composition of the films are dependent on deposition
   temperature, resulting in dramatic differences in performance over the
   temperature range studied. These results reveal the potential of n-BiSI
   as an alternative thin film solar energy conversion material and may
   stimulate further investigation into V-VI-VII compounds for these

Abstract = {{The effect of process conditions on the rate of thermal degradation of
   concentrated, aqueous piperazine (PZ) was investigated. At 150 degrees
   C, 8 m (m) PZ degrades with a first order rate constant, k(1), of 6.1 x
   10(-9) s(-1). Thermal degradation of 8 m PZ with 0.3 mol CO2/mol
   alkalinity demonstrated an Arrhenius dependence on temperature with an
   activation energy of 184 kJ/mol. Degradation at 175 degrees C was
   negligible with no dissolved CO2, while the k(1) increased from 65 to 71
   x 10(-9) s(-1) at 0.1 to 0.4 mol CO2/mol alkalinity and decreased to 24
   x 10(-9) at 0.47 mol CO2/mol alkalinity. In an industrial system with a
   simple stripper, losses due to thermal degradation are expected to be
   0.043 mmol PZ/mol CO2 captured. In the case of a 2-stage flash, losses
   are expected to be only 0.0086 mmol PZ/mol CO2 captured. A Maximum
   Estimated Stripper Temperature (MEST) was calculated for a variety of
   amines to provide the same thermal degradation rate of MEA at 120
   degrees C based on first order rate constants for amine loss during
   thermal degradation and the expected Arrhenius dependence on temperature
   for all amines. Substituted and unsubstituted 6-member amine rings were
   found to be the most thermally stable.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of degradation products at 135 to 175 degrees C was
   investigated for concentrated, aqueous piperazine (PZ) loaded with CO2.
   From 135 to 175 degrees C, N-formylpiperazine, ammonium,
   N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine, and 2-imidazolidone were found to be the
   most abundant products. These species accounted for 63\% of nitrogen and
   49\% of carbon lost as PZ and CO2 during degradation. Thermal
   degradation of PZ is believed to be initiated by the nucleophilic attack
   of PZ at the alpha-carbon to a protonated amino function on H(+)PZ to
   create a ring opened PZ structure. H(+)PZ was found to be the active and
   likely initiating species required for the initial reactions of thermal
   degradation. Further S(N)2 substitution reactions can produce a variety
   of products. CO2 is not required for thermal degradation to proceed but
   is reduced to create formate or formyl amides, reacts with amines to
   form stable ureas, and dictates the overall product mix. The mechanism
   for CO2 reduction to formate or formyl amides is not clear but indicates
   the severity of thermal degradation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrification can occur in water distribution systems where chloramines
   are used as the disinfectant. The resulting product, nitrite, can be
   oxidized by monochloramine and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), potentially
   leading to rapid monochloramine loss. This research characterizes the
   importance of the HOCl reaction, which has typically been ignored
   because of HOCl's low concentration. Also, the general acid-assisted
   rate constants for carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion were estimated for
   the monochloramine reaction. The nitrite oxidation reactions were
   incorporated into a widely accepted chloramine autodecomposition model,
   providing a comprehensive model that was implemented in AQUASIM. Batch
   kinetic experiments were conducted to evaluate the significance of the
   HOCl reaction and to estimate carbonate buffer rate constants for the
   monochloramine reaction. The experimental data and model simulations
   indicated that HOCl may be responsible for up to 60\% of the nitrite
   oxidation, and that the relative importance of the HOCl reaction for
   typical chloramination conditions peaks between pH 7.5 and 8.5,
   generally increasing with (1) decreasing nitrite concentration, (2)
   increasing chlorine to nitrogen mass ratio, and (3) decreasing
   monochloramine concentration. Therefore, nitrite's reaction with HOCl
   may be important during chloramination and should be included in water
   quality models to simulate nitrite and monochloramine's fate.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background-The differential diagnosis between idiopathic and
   cardiomyopathy-related right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT)
   ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) is crucial. Signal-averaged ECG (SAECG)
   abnormalities are frequent in cardiomyopathy-related RVOT-VAs, although
   their pathophysiologic basis and diagnostic value in this setting are
   undefined. We tested the association between SAECG and the myocardial
   substrate underlying RVOT-VAs.
   Methods and Results-Twenty-four consecutive patients (median age, 50
   years {[}42-59]; 12 men) with RVOT-VAs (10 with frequent {[}>1000/24
   hours] premature ventricular contractions, 14 with ventricular
   tachycardias) underwent SAECG with 40-Hz filtering and electroanatomic
   mapping (EAM) with EAM-guided biopsy for characterization of the
   RVOT-VAs substrate. A filtered averaged QRS (fQRS) was obtained and
   analyzed for fQRS duration, low amplitude signal duration <40 mV
   (LAS40), and root-mean-square voltage in the last 40 ms of the QRS
   (RMS40). Standard definition of EAM scar was used. EAM-guided biopsy
   diagnosed ARVC in 11 (46\%), myocarditis in 8 (33\%), and idiopathic
   RVOT-VAs in 5 (21\%) patients. Patients with cardiomyopathy-related
   RVOT-VAs had >= 1 EAM scar (median, 2 {[}1-2]; all with RVOT scar). EAM
   of patients with idiopathic RVOT-VAs was normal. Patients with
   cardiomyopathy-related RVOT-VAs had significantly longer fQRS (106 ms
   {[}92-132] versus 83 ms {[}82-84], P=0.01) and LAS40 (39 ms {[}36-51]
   versus 19 ms {[}18-21], P=0.02), and lower RMS40 (18 mu V {[}9-26]
   versus 33 mu V {[}32-33], P=0.04). A significant linear correlation was
   found between the extension (cm(2)) of the RVOT scar and all 3 SAECG
   parameters (r(s)=0.76, P<0.001 for the fQRSd; r(s)=0.73, P<0.001 for the
   LAS40; and r(s)=-0.72, P<0.001 for the RMS40). Using the established 2
   of 3 criteria (ie, late potentials), SAECG diagnosed
   cardiomyopathy-related RVOT-VAs with high positive (100\%) but low
   negative (38\%) predictive values and missed 7 of 9 (78\%) patients with
   RVOT scar < 8 cm(2).
   Conclusions-In patients with RVOT-VAs, abnormal SAECG parameters reflect
   the presence of extensive cardiomyopathic involvement of the RVOT.
   However, a negative SAECG does not reliably rule out
   cardiomyopathy-related RVOT-VAs in the presence of a small RVOT scar.

Abstract = {{Background-Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a significant therapeutic
   challenge in patients with myocarditis. This study aimed to assess the
   efficacy and safety of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of VT in
   patients with myocarditis.
   Methods and Results-We enrolled 20 patients (15 men; age, 42 {[}28-52]
   years) with a history of biopsy-proven viral myocarditis and
   drug-refractory VT; 5 patients presented with electrical storm. The
   median left ventricular ejection fraction was 55\% (45-60\%). All
   patients underwent endocardial RFCA with an irrigated catheter, using
   contact electroanatomic mapping. Recurrence of sustained VT after
   endocardial RFCA was treated with additional epicardial RFCA.
   Endocardial RFCA was acutely successful in 14 patients (70\%) while in
   the remaining 6 (30\%) clinical VT was successfully ablated by
   epicardial RFCA. In 1 patient, hemodynamic instability required an
   intra-aortic balloon pump to complete RFCA. No major complication
   occurred during or after RFCA. Over a median follow-up time of 28
   (11-48) months, 18 patients (90\%) remained free of sustained VT; 2
   patients (10\%, both with baseline left ventricular ejection fraction =
   35\%) died of acute heart failure unrelated to ventricular arrhythmias.
   Conclusions-In patients with myocarditis, RFCA of drug-refractory VT is
   feasible, safe, and effective. Epicardial RFCA should be considered as
   an important therapeutic option to increase success rate. (Circ Arrhythm

Abstract = {{This paper presents results for impedance (and compliance) functions and
   input motions of foundations in a layered half-space computed on the
   basis of a procedure that combines a consistent transmitting boundary
   with continued-fraction absorbing boundary conditions which are accurate
   and effective in modeling wave propagation in various unbounded domains.
   The effects of obliquely incident seismic waves in a layered half-space
   are taken into account in the formulation of the transmitting boundary.
   Using the numerical model, impedance (and compliance) functions and
   input motions of rigid circular foundations on the surface of or
   embedded in a homogeneous half-space are computed and compared with
   available published results for verification of the procedure.
   Extrapolation methods are proposed to improve the performance in the
   very-low-frequency range and for the static condition. It is concluded
   from the applications that accurate analysis of foundation dynamics and
   soil-structure interaction in a layered half-space can be carried out
   using the enhanced consistent transmitting boundary and the proposed

Abstract = {{Concern about the effects of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) and delayed
   ettringite formation (DEF) on dapped prestressed concrete trapezoidal
   box beams in Houston, Tex., prompted an investigation of their shear
   strength. Beams originally intended for a highway bridge project were
   stored in a local precast concrete yard and were exposed to the
   environment for 15 years. During that period, ASR/DEF deterioration of
   varying severity occurred.
   Load tests were conducted on five specimens (two of which are discussed
   in this paper) with varying levels of distress to study the performance
   of the dapped end and to assess the effect of the ASR/DEF deterioration
   on the in-service beams. The strength of each specimen was governed by
   shear-induced anchorage failure confirmed both by the formation of
   cracks in the development region and slip of the prestressing strands.
   The length available for the development of the flexural reinforcement
   was limited, and ASR/DEF cracking along the development length
   exacerbated the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Data on lifeline system service restoration is seldom exploited for the
   calibration of performance prediction models or for response comparisons
   across systems and events. This study explores utility restoration
   curves after the 2010 Chilean earthquake through a time series method to
   quantify coupling strengths across lifeline systems. When consistent
   with field information, cross-correlations from restoration curves
   without significant lag times quantify operational interdependence,
   whereas those with significant lags reveal logistical interdependence.
   Synthesized coupling strengths are also proposed to incorporate
   cross-correlations and lag times at once. In the Chilean earthquake,
   coupling across fixed and mobile phones was the strongest per region
   followed by coupling within and across telecommunication and power
   systems in adjacent regions. Unapparent couplings were also revealed
   among telecommunication and power systems with water networks. The
   proposed methodology can steer new protocols for post-disaster data
   collection, including anecdotal information to evaluate causality, and
   inform infrastructure interdependence effect prediction models. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose novel and global Architecture-Aware Analytic
   MAPping (A3MAP) algorithms applied to Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) not only
   with homogeneous Processing Elements (PEs) on a regular mesh network as
   done by most previous application mapping algorithms but also with
   heterogeneous PEs on an irregular mesh or custom network. As the main
   contributions, we develop a simple yet efficient interconnection matrix
   that can easily model any core graph and network. Then, an application
   mapping problem is exactly formulated to Mixed Integer Quadratic
   Programming (MIQP). Since MIQP is NP-hard, we propose two effective
   heuristics, a successive relaxation algorithm achieving short runtime,
   called A3MAP-SR and a genetic algorithm achieving high mapping quality,
   called A3MAP-GA. We also propose a partition-based application mapping
   approach for large-scale NoCs, which provides better trade-off between
   performance and runtime. Experimental results show that A3MAP algorithms
   reduce total hop count, compared to the previous application mapping
   algorithms optimized for a regular mesh network, called NMAP {[}Murali
   and Micheli 2004] and for an irregular mesh and custom network, called
   CMAP {[}Tornero et al. 2008]. Furthermore, A3MAP algorithms make packets
   travel shorter distance than CMAP, which is related to energy
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{``Cautious{''} gait is generally characterized by wider and shorter
   steps. However, we do not clearly understand the relationship between
   step characteristics and individuals' stability. Here, we examined the
   effects of voluntarily altering step width (SW) and step length (SL) on
   individuals' margins of stability. Fourteen participants completed three
   3-min treadmill walking trials during three SL (short, normal with
   metronome, and long) and three SW (narrow, normal and wide) manipulation
   conditions. SL manipulations yielded significant changes in mean
   anterior-posterior (AP) margins of stability (MOSap) (p < 0.0005) but
   not mediolateral (ML) margins of stability (MOSmt) (p >= 0.0579). Taking
   wider steps increased mean MOSml while decreasing MOSap (p < 0.0005).
   Walking with either wider or long steps, each of which increases the
   base of support, yielded increased AP and ML MOS variability (p <=
   0.0468). Step-to-step analysis of MOSml indicated that subjects took
   stable steps followed immediately by stable steps. Overall, short-term,
   voluntary adoption of wider steps may help increase instantaneous
   lateral stability but shorter steps did not change lateral stability
   during unperturbed walking. We suggest that the observed changes in
   stability margins be considered in gait training programs which
   recommend short-term changes in step characteristics to improve
   stability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we demonstrate that the assembly of nanostructures with different
   di-mensionalities yields ``multicomponent hybrid{''} transparent
   conductive films (TCFs) with sheet resistance and optical transmittance
   comparable to that of indium tin oxide (ITO) films. It was shown that
   sheet resistance of single-component Ag nanowire (NW) films can be
   further decreased by introducing gold-decorated reduced graphene oxide
   (RG-O) nanoplatelets that bridge the closely located noncontacting metal
   NWs. RG-O nanoplatelets can act as a protective and adhesive layer for
   underneath metal NWs, resulting in better performance of hybrid TCFs
   compared to single-component TCFs. Additionally, these hybrid TCFs
   possess antibacterial properties, demonstrating their multifunctional
   characteristics that might have a potential for biomedical device
   applications. Further development of this strategy paves a way toward
   next generation TCFs composed of different nanostructures and
   characterized by multiple (or additional) functionalities.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction-diffusion phenomena are encountered in an astonishing array of
   natural systems. Under the right conditions, self stabilizing reaction
   waves can arise that will propagate at constant velocity. Numerical
   studies have shown that fission waves of this type are also possible and
   that they exhibit soliton like properties. Here, we derive the
   conditions required for a solitary fission wave to propagate at constant
   velocity. The results place strict conditions on the shapes of the flux,
   diffusive, and reactive profiles that would be required for such a
   phenomenon to persist, and this condition would apply to other reaction
   diffusion phenomena as well. Numerical simulations are used to confirm
   the results and show that solitary fission waves fall into a bistable
   class of reaction diffusion phenomena. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Worldwide, algal biofuel research and development efforts have focused
   on increasing the competitiveness of algal biofuels by increasing the
   energy and financial return on investments, reducing water intensity and
   resource requirements, and increasing algal productivity. In this study,
   analyses are presented in each of these areas-costs, resource needs, and
   productivity-for two cases: (1) an Experimental Case, using mostly
   measured data for a lab-scale system, and (2) a theorized Highly
   Productive Case that represents an optimized commercial-scale production
   system, albeit one that relies on full-price water, nutrients, and
   carbon dioxide. For both cases, the analysis described herein concludes
   that the energy and financial return on investments are less than 1, the
   water intensity is greater than that for conventional fuels, and the
   amounts of required resources at a meaningful scale of production amount
   to significant fractions of current consumption (e.g., nitrogen). The
   analysis and presentation of results highlight critical areas for
   advancement and innovation that must occur for sustainable and
   profitable algal biofuel production can occur at a scale that yields
   significant petroleum displacement. To this end, targets for energy
   consumption, production cost, water consumption, and nutrient
   consumption are presented that would promote sustainable algal biofuel
   production. Furthermore, this work demonstrates a procedure and method
   by which subsequent advances in technology and biotechnology can be
   framed to track progress.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2136-2147}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most work on wireless network throughput ignores the temporal
   correlation inherent to wireless channels because it degrades
   tractability. To better model and quantify the temporal variations of
   wireless network throughput, this paper introduces a metric termed
   ergodic transmission capacity (ETC), which includes spatial and temporal
   ergodicity. All transmitters in the network form a homogeneous Poisson
   point process and all channels are modeled by a finite state Markov
   chain. The bounds on outage probability and ETC are characterized, and
   their scaling behaviors for a sparse and dense network are discussed.
   From these results, we show that the ETC can be characterized by the
   inner product of the channel-state related vector and the invariant
   probability vector of the Markov chain. This indicates that distributed
   channel-aware scheduling (DCAS) does not always increase ETC. Finally,
   we look at outage probability with interference management from a
   stochastic geometry point of view. The improved bounds on outage
   probability and ETC due to interference management are characterized and
   they provide some useful insights on how to effectively manage
   interference in sparse and dense networks.}},

Title = {{Proximal Versus Distal Control of Two-Joint Planar Reaching Movements in
   the Presence of Neuromuscular Noise}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{Determining how the human nervous system contends with neuro-motor noise
   is vital to understanding how humans achieve accurate goal-directed
   movements. Experimentally, people learning skilled tasks tend to reduce
   variability in distal joint movements more than in proximal joint
   movements. This suggests that they might be imposing greater control
   over distal joints than proximal joints. However, the reasons for this
   remain unclear, largely because it is not experimentally possible to
   directly manipulate either the noise or the control at each joint
   independently. Therefore, this study used a 2 degree-of-freedom torque
   driven arm model to determine how different combinations of noise and/or
   control independently applied at each joint affected the reaching
   accuracy and the total work required to make the movement.
   Signal-dependent noise was simultaneously and independently added to the
   shoulder and elbow torques to induce endpoint errors during planar
   reaching. Feedback control was then applied, independently and jointly,
   at each joint to reduce endpoint error due to the added neuromuscular
   noise. Movement direction and the inertia distribution along the arm
   were varied to quantify how these biomechanical variations affected the
   system performance. Endpoint error and total net work were computed as
   dependent measures. When each joint was independently subjected to noise
   in the absence of control, endpoint errors were more sensitive to distal
   (elbow) noise than to proximal (shoulder) noise for nearly all
   combinations of reaching direction and inertia ratio. The effects of
   distal noise on endpoint errors were more pronounced when inertia was
   distributed more toward the forearm. In contrast, the total net work
   decreased as mass was shifted to the upper arm for reaching movements in
   all directions. When noise was present at both joints and joint control
   was implemented, controlling the distal joint alone reduced endpoint
   errors more than controlling the proximal joint alone for nearly all
   combinations of reaching direction and inertia ratio. Applying control
   only at the distal joint was more effective at reducing endpoint errors
   when more of the mass was more proximally distributed. Likewise,
   controlling the distal joint alone required less total net work than
   controlling the proximal joint alone for nearly all combinations of
   reaching distance and inertia ratio. It is more efficient to reduce
   endpoint error and energetic cost by selectively applying control to
   reduce variability in the distal joint than the proximal joint. The
   reasons for this arise from the biomechanical configuration of the arm
   itself. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006811]}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to evaluate alkaline/surfactant (AS) methods to
   improve recovery from heavy-oil reservoirs. Alkali/surfactant/oil
   phase-behavior experiments were conducted to determine conditions under
   which oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions form. The viscosity (and its shear
   dependence) was measured for some of these emulsions. Reservoir sand was
   assembled in sandpacks. Waterflood and AS floods were conducted at
   several salinities. Several relatively hydrophilic surfactants were
   identified, which formed O/W emulsions with the reservoir oil at a low
   concentration in the presence of sodium carbonate. O/W emulsions were
   favored at low salinity and high water/oil ratio (WOR). Viscosity of
   these emulsions was low compared with the oil viscosity. Waterflood
   recovery was on the order of 25 to 40\% of the original oil in place
   (OOIP) in core-floods, and it decreased as the injection rate increased.
   Following the waterflood, the AS flood gave an incremental oil recovery
   of 10 to 35\% of OOIP. The incremental post-breakthrough oil recovery
   during the waterflood is likely because of the imbibition of the water
   from viscous fingers into the unswept oil-saturated zone; this recovery
   is directly proportional to the square root of time.}},

Abstract = {{Arginases catalyze the divalent cation-dependent hydrolysis of
   L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine. There is significant interest in
   using arginase as a therapeutic anti-neogenic agent against L-arginine
   auxotrophic tumors and in enzyme replacement therapy for treating
   hyperargininemia. Both therapeutic applications require enzymes with
   sufficient stability under physiological conditions. To explore sequence
   elements that contribute to arginase stability we used SCHEMA-guided
   recombination to design a library of chimeric enzymes composed of
   sequence fragments from the. two human isozymes Arginase I and II. We
   then developed a novel active learning algorithm that selects sequences
   from this library that are both highly informative and functional. Using
   high-throughput gene synthesis and our two-step active learning
   algorithm, we were able to rapidly create a small but highly informative
   set of seven enzymatically active chimeras that had an average variant
   distance of 40 mutations from the closest parent arginase. Within this
   set of sequences, linear regression was used to identify the sequence
   elements that contribute to the long-term stability of human arginase
   under physiological conditions., This approach revealed a striking
   correlation between the isoelectric point and the long-term stability of
   the enzyme to deactivation under physiological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Generating muscle-driven forward dynamics simulations of human movement

   This is due in part to the time required to calculate musculotendon
   geometry (e.g., musculotendon lengths and moment arms), which is
   necessary to determine and apply individual musculotendon forces during
   the simulation. Modeling upper-extremity musculotendon geometry can be
   especially challenging due to the large number of multi-articular
   muscles and complex muscle paths. To accurately represent this geometry,
   wrapping surface algorithms and/or other computationally expensive
   techniques (e.g., phantom segments) are used. This paper provides a set
   of computationally efficient polynomial regression equations that
   estimate musculotendon length and moment arms for thirty-two (32)
   upper-extremity musculotendon actuators representing the major muscles
   crossing the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. Equations were developed
   using a least squares fitting technique based on geometry values
   obtained from a validated public-domain upper-extremity musculoskeletal
   model that used wrapping surface elements (Holzbaur et al., 2005). In
   general, the regression equations fit well the original model values,
   with an average root mean square difference for all musculotendon
   actuators over the represented joint space of 0.39 mm (1.1\% of peak
   value). In addition, the equations reduced the computational time
   required to simulate a representative upper-extremity movement (i.e.,
   wheelchair propulsion) by more than two orders of magnitude (315 versus
   2.3 s). Thus, these equations can assist in generating computationally
   efficient forward dynamics simulations of a wide range of
   upper-extremity movements. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of different flow regimes in industrial systems operating
   under two-phase flow conditions is necessary in order to safely design
   and optimize their performance. In the present work, experiments on
   two-phase flow have been performed in a large scale test facility with
   the length of 6 m and diameter of 5 cm. Four main flow regimes have been
   observed in vertical air-water two-phase flow at moderate superficial
   velocities of gas and water namely: Bubbly, Slug, Churn, and Annular. An
   image processing technique was used to extract information from each
   picture. This information includes the number of bubbles or objects,
   area, perimeter, as well as the height and width of objects (second
   phase). In addition, a texture feature extraction procedure was applied
   to images of different regimes. Some features which were adequate for
   regime identification were extracted such as contrast, energy, entropy,
   etc. To identify flow regimes, a fuzzy interface was introduced using
   characteristic of second phase in picture. Furthermore, an Adaptive
   Neuro Fuzzy (ANFIS) was used to identify flow patterns using textural
   features of images. The experimental results show that these methods can
   accurately identify the flow patterns in a vertical pipe. {[}DOI:

Title = {{Surface trajectories of oil transport along the Northern Coastline of
   the Gulf of Mexico}},
Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{After the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform during
   the spring of 2010, the northern Gulf of Mexico was threatened by an oil
   spill from the Macondo well. Emergency responders were concerned about
   oil transport in the nearshore, where it threatened immediately the
   fishing waters and coastline from Louisiana to Florida. In this region,
   oil movement was influenced by a continental shelf with varying width,
   the protruding Mississippi River delta, the marshes and bayou of
   southern Louisiana, and the shallow sounds and barrier islands that
   protect the coastline. Transport forecasts require physics-based
   computational models and nigh-resolution meshes that represent the
   circulation in deep water, on the continental shelf, and within the
   complex nearshore environment.
   This work applies the coupled SWAN + ADCIRC model on a high-resolution
   computational mesh to simulate the current velocity field on the
   continental shelf, nearshore and marsh areas during the time that oil
   was visible on the surface of the Gulf. The SWAN + ADCIRC simulations
   account for the influence of tides, riverine discharge, winds and
   wind-driven waves. A highly efficient Lagrangian particle transport
   model is employed to simulate the surface trajectories of the oil. The
   transport model accounts for dispersion and advection by wind and
   currents. Transport is evaluated using 2-week long sequences of
   satellite images. During both periods, the SWAN + ADCIRC current fields
   alone appeared to be more successful moving the oil than when direct
   wind forcing was included. In addition, hypothetical oil transport is
   considered during two hurricane scenarios. Had a hurricane significantly
   impacted the northern Gulf while the spill was active, depending on the
   track of the storm relative to the spill location, oil would have moved
   farther into the marshes of southern Louisiana or farther along the
   shelf toward Texas than actually occurred during the spill. Published by

Abstract = {{The influence of polydopamine- and polydopamine-graft-poly(ethylene

   and commercially-available biostatic feed spacers on biofouling has been
   studied in membrane fouling simulators. Feed spacers and membranes
   applied in practical membrane filtration systems were used; biofouling
   development was monitored by feed channel pressure drop increase and
   biomass accumulation. Polydopamine and polydopamine-g-PEG are
   hydrophilic surface modification agents expected to resist protein and
   bacterial adhesion, while copper feed spacer coatings and biocides
   infused in feed spacers are expected to restrict biological growth. Our
   studies showed that polydopamine and polydopamine-g-PEG coatings on feed
   spacers and membranes, copper coatings on feed spacers, and a commercial
   biostatic feed spacer did not have a significant impact on feed channel
   pressure drop increase and biofilm accumulation as measured by ATP and
   TOC content. The studied spacer and membrane modifications were not
   effective for biofouling control; it is doubtful that feed spacer and
   membrane modification, in general, may be effective for biofouling
   control regardless of the type of applied coating. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Effect of Thermal Stresses on Carrier Mobility and Keep-Out Zone Around
   Through-Silicon Vias for 3-D Integration}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) integration with through-silicon vias (TSVs) has
   emerged as an effective solution to overcome the wiring limit imposed on
   device density and performance. However, thermal stresses induced in the
   TSV structures can affect the device performance by degrading carrier
   mobility and raise serious reliability concerns. In this paper, the
   effect of thermal stresses in TSV structures on carrier mobility and
   keep-out zone (KOZ) was investigated by focusing on the characteristics
   of the stresses near the surface where the electronic devices are
   located. The near-surface stresses were characterized by finite element
   analysis, and the stress effect on carrier mobility was evaluated by
   considering the piezoresistivity effect near the Si surface. In this
   paper, the elastic anisotropy of Si was taken into account to evaluate
   the effect on carrier mobility for both n- and p-channel MOSFET devices
   aligned along the {[}100] and {[}110] directions. The results showed a
   significant stress effect on carrier mobility, particularly for n-type
   Si with {[}100] device alignment and p-type Si with {[}110] device
   alignment. Based on these results, the dimension of the KOZ was
   estimated based on a criterion of 5\% change in the carrier mobility.
   Finally, the effects due to stress interactions in a TSV array and
   plasticity in Cu vias on the KOZ were investigated. The effect of stress
   interaction was found to depend on the ratio of the pitch to diameter of
   the TSV array. When this ratio is less than 5, the stress interaction
   can increase the size of the KOZ. In contrast, the via material
   plasticity was found to be useful in reducing the stress level and hence
   the size of the KOZ.}},

Abstract = {{Proton conduction and oxygen transport in the cathodes of direct
   methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are affected by the loading and distribution
   of Nafion ionomer. These effects of ionomer in the catalyst layer with
   carbon-supported catalysts on the cathode performance were investigated
   by electrochemical techniques and single cell testing in order to
   improve the power output of DMFC. It is found that varying the Nafion
   content has minimal effect on the electrochemical surface area (ESA) and
   catalyst utilization, but has significant effect on pore structure,
   proton conduction, and oxygen transport in the catalyst layer. A higher
   content of Nafion ionomer is needed in DMFC cathodes to achieve the same
   specific conductivity as in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)
   due to the higher catalyst loading in DMFCs. Optimal cell performance is
   achieved with a balance among catalytic activity, proton conductivity,
   and oxygen transport. These findings could provide guidelines for
   electrode design, fabrication, and prediction of cell performance.

Abstract = {{The challenges for rechargeable batteries are cost, safety, energy,
   density, life, and rate. Traditional rechargeable batteries based on
   aqueous electrolytes have good rate capabilities but limited energy
   density because the voltage for a long shelf-life is restricted to 1.5
   V. The discovery of fast Na ion conductivity in beta-alumina in 1967
   introduced the novel concept of a solid oxide electrolyte and molten
   electrodes: the sodium-sulfur battery operates at 350 A degrees C.
   Interest in rechargeable batteries with aprotic electrolytes was further
   stimulated by the first energy crisis in the early 1970s. Since protons
   are not mobile in aprotic electrolytes, the Li+ ion was the logical
   choice for the working ion, and on-going work on reversible Li
   intercalation into layered sulfides suggested the TiS2//Li cell, which
   was shown in 1976 to have a voltage of V a parts per thousand integral
   aEuro parts per thousand 2.2 V and good rate capability. However, the
   organic liquid carbonates used as electrolytes are flammable, and
   dendrites growing across the electrolyte from the lithium anode on
   repeated charge/discharge cycles short-circuited the cells with
   disastrous consequences. Safety concerns caused this effort to be
   dropped. However, substitution of the layered oxides LiMO2 for the
   layered sulfides MS2 and reversible intercalation of Li into graphitic
   carbon without dendrite formation at slow charging rates gave a safe
   rechargeable lithium ion battery (LIB) of large-enough energy density to
   enable the wireless revolution. Although carbon-buffered alloys now
   provide anodes that allow a fast charge and have a higher capacity,
   nevertheless a passivation layer permeable to Li+ forms on the anode
   surface, and the Li+ in the passivation layer is taken irreversibly from
   the cathode on the initial charge. Since the specific capacity of a cell
   with an insertion-compound cathode is limited by the latter, strategies
   to increase the specific capacity for a LIB powering an electric vehicle
   or storing electricity from wind or solar farms include a return to
   consideration of a solid electrolyte.}},

Abstract = {{The strongly correlated thermoelectric properties have been a major
   hurdle for high-performance thermoelectric energy conversion. One
   possible approach to avoid such correlation is to suppress phonon
   transport by scattering at the surface of confined nanowire structures.
   However, phonon characteristic lengths are broad in crystalline solids,
   which makes nanowires insufficient to fully suppress heat transport.
   Here, we employed Si-Ge alloy as well as nanowire structures to maximize
   the depletion of heat-carrying phonons. This results in a thermal
   conductivity as low as similar to 1.2 W/m-K at 450 K, showing a large
   thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) of similar to 0.46 compared with
   those of SiGe bulks and even ZT over 2 at 800 K theoretically. All
   thermoelectric properties were ``simultaneously{''} measured from the
   same nanowires to facilitate accurate ZT measurements. The
   surface-boundary scattering is prominent when the nanowire diameter is
   over similar to 100 nm, whereas alloying plays a more important role in
   suppressing phonon transport for smaller ones.}},

Abstract = {{We present measurements of band alignment of atomic layer deposited
   high-k dielectrics on Si(100) using linear internal photoemission (IPE),
   detected by measuring photocurrent from a biased MOS capacitor, and
   internal multi-photon photoemission (IMPE), detected by optical
   second-harmonic generation (SHG). In IPE, Band offsets are extracted
   from either the threshold of quantum yield; in IMPE, they are determined
   by detecting discrete increments in multi-photon order. IPE and IMPE
   yielded identical conduction band (CB) offsets (2.0?eV) for as-deposited
   Si/Al2O3 structures with 10 and 3?nm oxides, respectively, in excellent
   agreement with previous measurements of annealed structures. Band offset
   measurements for Si/HfO2, on the other hand, show a strong (0.3?eV)
   upshift of the oxide valence band (VB) maximum, and an equal decrease of
   the oxide band gap upon post-deposition annealing (PDA) at 600?degrees
   C, while the CB offset remains unchanged. We attribute the shift of the
   VB edge to thermally driven oxygen diffusion away from the Si/HfO2
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{Optical bistability of nonlinear guided-mode resonances in photonic
   crystal slabs (PCSs) are numerically investigated. We perform
   finite-difference time-domain simulations to determine the linear and
   nonlinear characteristics of these guided-mode resonances in PCSs. The
   nonlinear characteristics such as switching intensity and switching
   time, which are suggested as the performance metric of all-optical
   switches, are similar to the all-optical switches in slab waveguide
   gratings. While the slab waveguide gratings are sensitive to the
   incoming light polarization, the PCSs can offer an advantage of avoiding
   reduction efficiency and a requirement of careful polarization
   stabilization of the light source. From the calculations, we introduce a
   dependency of the normalized switching intensity and the switching time
   of the all-optical switches on quality factor for our designed
   guided-mode resonances in PCSs. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A computational modeling study of streamer propagation in a cold,
   atmospheric-pressure, helium jet in ambient air is presented. A
   self-consistent, multi-species, multi-temperature plasma model with
   detailed finite-rate chemistry and photoionization effects is used to
   provide fundamental insights into the structure and dynamics of the
   streamers. A parametric study of the streamer properties as a function
   of important discharge geometric and operating conditions is performed.
   The fluid mechanical mixing layer between the helium jet core and the
   ambient air is instrumental in guiding the propagation direction of the
   streamer and gives the plasma jet a visibly collimated appearance. The
   key chemical reactions which drive the streamer propagation are
   electron-impact ionization of helium neutral and nitrogen molecules.
   Photoionization plays a role in enhancing the propagation speed of the
   streamer, but is not necessary to sustain the streamer. The streamer
   yields a large radical concentration through chemical reactions in the
   streamer head and the body. The streamer propagation speed increases
   with reduced helium jet radius and increased helium-air mixing layer
   width. Impurities in the helium jet result in a significant increase in
   the discharge propagation speed within the tube through photoionization,
   but not after the streamer propagates into the open ambient region. It
   is also observed that thinner electrodes produce stronger electric-field
   concentrations that increase discharge propagation speeds within the
   tube but have a smaller influence on the discharge after it emerges out
   of the tube as a streamer.}},

Abstract = {{Small-strain seismic measurements in sand specimens were undertaken in
   the laboratory using piezoelectric transducers. The measurements
   involved determining both constrained compression wave and shear wave
   velocities, V-p and V-s, respectively. The piezoelectric transducers
   were discs (PDs) for V-p measurements and bender elements (BEs) for V-s
   measurements. An instrumented triaxial chamber (ITC) was developed and
   associated support instrumentation was assembled to perform the seismic
   measurements. The same PDs and BEs were installed in a combined resonant
   column and torsional shear (RCTS) device. The soil tested in both
   devices was washed mortar sand. The sand was tested in dry, unsaturated,
   and saturated conditions in the ITC, while only dry sand was tested in
   the RCTS. Development, calibration, and operation of the PDs and BEs are
   discussed. Example waveforms are presented, which are associated with
   different stress levels, saturation conditions, and frequencies of
   excitation for P and S waves. A critical factor in performing successful
   measurements is the driving of each type of piezoelectric transducer at
   the optimum frequency, which depends on the effective confining pressure
   (sigma(0)'), degree of saturation, and soil type. The excitation
   frequency used for PDs was found to be important when the sand specimens
   were at nearly or fully saturated conditions.}},

   confocal imaging system, optical design simulations using CODE V-R (R)
   shows the lateral and axial resolution to be 0.98 mu m and 4.2 mu m,
   where experimental values were determined to be 3 mu m and 5.8 mu m,
   respectively, with a FOV of 280 mu m x 300 mu m. Fast Lissajous imaging
   speed up to 2 fps was realized with improved Labview and Java based
   real-time imaging software. Properties such as 3D imaging through
   autofocusing and mosaic imaging for extended lateral view (6 mm x 8 mm)
   were examined for carcinoma real-time pathology. Neoplastic lesion
   tissues of giant cell fibroma and peripheral ossifying fibroma, the
   fibroma inside the paraffin box and ex vivo gross tissues were imaged by
   the bench-top and handheld imaging modalities, and further compared with
   commercial microscope imaging results. The MEMS scanner-based handheld
   confocal imaging probe shows great promise as a potential clinical tool
   for oral cancer diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops upper bounds on the end-to-end transmission capacity
   of multihop wireless networks. Potential source-destination paths are
   dynamically selected from a pool of randomly located relays, from which
   a closed-form lower bound on the outage probability is derived in terms
   of the expected number of potential paths. This is in turn used to
   provide an upper bound on the number of successful transmissions that
   can occur per unit area, which is known as the transmission capacity.
   The upper bound results from assuming independence among the potential
   paths, and can be viewed as the maximum diversity case. A useful aspect
   of the upper bound is its simple form for an arbitrary-sized network,
   which allows insights into how the number of hops and other network
   parameters affect spatial throughput in the nonasymptotic regime. The
   outage probability analysis is then extended to account for
   retransmissions with a maximum number of allowed attempts. In contrast
   to prevailing wisdom, we show that predetermined routing (such as
   nearest neighbor) is suboptimal, since more hops are not useful once the
   network is interference-limited. Our results also make clear that
   randomness in the location of relay sets and dynamically varying channel
   states is helpful in obtaining higher aggregate throughput, and that
   dynamic route selection should be used to exploit path diversity.}},

Title = {{Estimating Parameters of Sampled Diffusion Processes in Affinity

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Affinity biosensors rely on chemical attraction between targets of
   interest (mRNA and DNA sequences, proteins) and their molecular
   complements, probes, which serve as biological sensing elements. The
   attraction between complementary sequences leads to binding, in which
   probes capture target molecules. Molecular binding is a stochastic
   process and hence the number of captured analytes at any time is a
   random variable. Real-time affinity biosensors acquire multiple temporal
   samples of the binding process. In this paper, estimation of the amounts
   of target molecules in real-time affinity-based biosensors is studied.
   The problem is mapped to the inference of the parameters of a temporally
   sampled diffusion process. To solve it, we employ a sequential Monte
   Carlo algorithm which relies on transition density of the sampled
   diffusion process to approximate posteriori distributions of the unknown
   variables given the acquired measurements. The transition density is not
   available in a closed form and is therefore approximated using Hermite
   polynomial expansion. We show that when the number of target molecules
   is much smaller than the number of probe molecules, the binding reaction
   can be described by the so-called Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process. Limits of
   performance of the parameter estimation are characterized by means of
   the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Simulations and experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing techniques for
   estimation in affinity biosensors.}},

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1290-1297}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The performance and operating characteristics of a hypothetical
   thermoelectric generator system designed to extract waste heat from the
   exhaust of a medium-duty turbocharged diesel engine were modeled. The
   finite-difference model consisted of two integrated submodels: a heat
   exchanger model and a thermoelectric device model. The heat exchanger
   model specified a rectangular cross-sectional geometry with liquid
   coolant on the cold side, and accounted for the difference between the
   heat transfer rate from the exhaust and that to the coolant. With the
   spatial variation of the thermoelectric properties accounted for, the
   thermoelectric device model calculated the hot-side and cold-side heat
   flux for the temperature boundary conditions given for the
   thermoelectric elements, iterating until temperature and heat flux
   boundary conditions satisfied the convection conditions for both exhaust
   and coolant, and heat transfer in the thermoelectric device. A downhill
   simplex method was used to optimize the parameters that affected the
   electrical power output, including the thermoelectric leg height,
   thermoelectric -type to -type leg area ratio, thermoelectric leg area to
   void area ratio, load electrical resistance, exhaust duct height,
   coolant duct height, fin spacing in the exhaust duct, location in the
   engine exhaust system, and number of flow paths within the constrained
   package volume. The calculation results showed that the configuration
   with 32 straight fins was optimal across the 30-cm-wide duct for the
   case of a single duct with total height of 5.5 cm. In addition, three
   counterflow parallel ducts or flow paths were found to be an optimum
   number for the given size constraint of 5.5 cm total height, and
   parallel ducts with counterflow were a better configuration than
   serpentine flow. Based on the reported thermoelectric properties of
   MnSi1.75 and Mg2Si0.5Sn0.5, the maximum net electrical power achieved
   for the three parallel flow paths in a counterflow arrangement was 1.06
   kW for package volume of 16.5 L and exhaust flow enthalpy flux of 122
   kW.}},

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline higher manganese silicide (HMS) samples with different
   grain sizes have been obtained by cold-pressing HMS powder under high
   pressure of about 3 GPa and postprocessing annealing. It was found that
   the cold-pressing process can reduce the grain size of HMS to 120 nm.
   The cold-pressed pellets were then annealed at different temperatures to
   obtain a series of samples with different grain sizes. For comparison,
   an additional sample was prepared in a regular die under low pressure of
   300 MPa, which resulted in lower density and higher porosity than the
   high-pressure process. For these samples, the effect of grain size and
   porosity on Seebeck coefficient was not as apparent as that on
   electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity. The electrical
   conductivity of the cold-pressed samples increases as the grains grow,
   and the grain boundary connection is improved during the postprocessing
   annealing. A significant reduction in the thermal conductivity of the
   cold-pressed samples was observed. The sample prepared with the
   low-pressure pressing shows the lowest thermal conductivity of 1.2 W
   m(-1) K-1 at 300 K, which can be attributed to its high porosity of 34\%
   and low phonon transmission coefficient through the grain boundaries.
   The low-temperature thermal conductivity data of all samples were
   analyzed to obtain the phonon transmission coefficient and the Kapitza
   resistance at the grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the delivery of hydrophobic therapeutic agents, a new
   class of polymer carriers was synthesized. These carriers are composed
   of two components: (i) a pH-responsive hydrogel composed of methacrylic
   acid grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) tethers, P(MAA-g-EG), and (ii)
   hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanoparticles. Before the
   P(MAA-g-EG) hydrogel was crosslinked, PMMA nanoparticles were added to
   the solution and upon exposure to UV light they were photoencapsulated
   throughout the P(MAA-g-EG) hydrogel structure. The pH-responsive
   behavior of P(MAA-g-EG) is capable of triggered release of a loaded
   therapeutic agent, such as a low molecular weight drug or protein, when
   it passes from the stomach (low pH) to upper small intestine (neutral
   pH). The introduction of PMMA nanoparticles into the hydrogel structure
   affected the swelling behavior, therapeutic agent loading efficiency,
   and solute release profiles. In equilibrium swelling conditions the
   swelling ratio of nanoparticle-containing hydrogels decreased with
   increasing nanoparticle content. Loading efficiencies of the model
   therapeutic agent fluorescein ranged from 38\% to 51\% and increased
   with increasing hydrophobic content. Release studies from neat
   P(MAA-g-EG) and the ensuing P(MAA-g-EG) hydrogels containing
   nanoparticles indicated that the transition from low pH (2.0) to neutral
   pH (7.0) triggered fluorescein release. Maximum fluorescein release
   depended on the structure and hydrophobicity of the carriers used in
   these studies. Copyright (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous base stations (e. g., picocells, microcells, femtocells,
   and distributed antennas) will become increasingly essential for
   cellular network capacity and coverage. Up until now, little basic
   research has been done on the fundamentals of managing so much
   infrastructure-much of it unplanned-together with the carefully planned
   macro-cellular network. Inter-cell coordination is in principle an
   effective way of ensuring different infrastructure components behave in
   a way that increases, rather than decreases, the key quality of service
   (QoS) metrics. The success of such coordination depends heavily on how
   the overhead is shared, and the rate and delay of the overhead sharing.
   We develop a novel framework to quantify overhead signaling for
   inter-cell coordination, which is usually ignored in traditional 1-tier
   networks, and assumes even more importance in multi-tier heterogeneous
   cellular networks (HCNs). We derive the overhead quality contour for
   general-tier HCNs-the achievable set of overhead packet rate, size,
   delay, and outage probability-in closed-form expressions or computable
   integrals under general assumptions on overhead arrivals and different
   overhead signaling methods (backhaul and/or wireless). The overhead
   quality contour is further simplified for two widely used models of
   overhead arrivals: Poisson and deterministic arrival process. This
   framework can be used in the design and evaluation of any inter-cell
   coordination scheme. It also provides design insights on backhaul and
   wireless overhead channels to handle specific overhead signaling
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{As solar photovoltaic power generation becomes more commonplace, the
   inherent intermittency of the solar resource poses one of the great
   challenges to those who would design and implement the next generation
   smart grid. Specifically, grid-tied solar power generation is a
   distributed resource whose output can change extremely rapidly,
   resulting in many issues for the distribution system operator with a
   large quantity of installed photovoltaic devices. Battery energy storage
   systems are increasingly being used to help integrate solar power into
   the grid. These systems are capable of absorbing and delivering both
   real and reactive power with sub-second response times. With these
   capabilities, battery energy storage systems can mitigate such issues
   with solar power generation as ramp rate, frequency, and voltage issues.
   Beyond these applications focusing on system stability, energy storage
   control systems can also be integrated with energy markets to make the
   solar resource more economical. Providing a high-level introduction to
   this application area, this paper presents an overview of the challenges
   of integrating solar power to the electricity distribution system, a
   technical overview of battery energy storage systems, and illustrates a
   variety of modes of operation for battery energy storage systems in
   grid-tied solar applications. The real-time control modes discussed
   include ramp rate control, frequency droop response, power factor
   correction, solar time-shifting, and output leveling.}},

Abstract = {{A second-order, general dynamics, relative motion framework is
   formulated to solve for optimal finite-bum transfers in complex gravity
   fields that are not amenable to analytic solutions. The second-order
   variational equations are employed in a Cartesian frame that is general
   in fidelity and simple to implement. For a passive chief orbit we show
   that only 16 coefficient functions are necessary to accommodate most
   dynamical environments of interest. We pre-compute and curve-fit the
   coefficient functions which represent the time-varying Jacobians and
   Hessians of the state equations evaluated along the chief orbit. Once
   the coefficient functions are evaluated, the resulting CUrve-fit
   quadRatic Variational Equations (CURVE) model is almost transparent to
   the fidelity level and therefore is well suited for the repeated
   iterations required by nonlinear optimization. The optimal control
   problem is solved using a robust, second-order technique that is a
   variant of differential dynamic programming. The model and optimal
   rendezvous problems are demonstrated in the highly perturbed dynamical
   environment of the Martian moon Deimos. The resulting implementation is
   useful for any relative motion application requiring optimal targeting,
   particularly in the context of complex force fields. While intended
   primarily for exotic destinations such as the Moon, asteroids, comets,
   and planetary satellites, the CURVE model and optimal control framework
   can also be useful for Earth orbiters, especially in cases of large
   eccentricity and high fidelity geopotentials.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{This study is an experimental determination of the energy return on
   investment (EROI) for algal biocrude production at a research facility
   at the University of Texas at Austin (UT). During the period of this
   assessment, algae were grown at several cultivation scales and processed
   using centrifugation for harvesting, electromechanical cell lysing, and
   a microporous hollow fiber membrane contactor for lipid separation. The
   separated algal lipids represent a biocrude product that could be
   refined into fuel and the post-extraction biomass could be converted to
   methane. To determine the EROI, a second-order analysis was conducted,
   which includes direct and indirect energy flows, but does not include
   energy expenses associated with capital investments. The EROI for the
   production process evaluated here was significantly less than 1,
   however, the majority of the energy consumption resulted from
   non-optimized growth conditions. While the experimental results do not
   represent an expected typical case EROI for algal fuels, the approach
   and end-to-end experimental determination of the different inputs and
   outputs provides a useful outline of the important parameters to
   consider in such an analysis. The Experimental Case results are the
   first known experimental energy balance for an integrated algal biocrude
   production facility, and as such, are expected to be helpful for setting
   research and development priorities. In addition to the Experimental
   Case (based on direct measurements), three analytical cases were
   considered in this work: (1) a Reduced (Inputs) Case, (2) a Highly
   Productive Case, and (3) a Literature Model. The Reduced (Inputs) Case
   and the Highly Productive Case speculate the energy use for a similar
   system in an improved, commercial-scale production setting. The
   Literature Model is populated with relevant data that have previously
   been reported in the literature. For the Experimental Case, Reduced
   Case, Highly Productive Case, and Literature Model, the estimated
   second-order EROI was 9.2 x 10(-4), 0.074, 0.22, and 0.35, respectively.
   These results were dominated by growth inputs (96\%, 89\%, 87\%, and
   61\% of the total energy requirement, respectively). Furthermore, the
   EROI was adjusted using quality factors that were calculated according
   to the price of each input, yielding a quality-adjusted EROI that
   parallels a partial financial return on investment analysis. For the
   Experimental Case, the Reduced Case, and the Highly Productive Case, the
   quality-adjusted EROI was 9.2 x 10(-5), 0.013, and 0.36, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical evidence suggests that nano- and microtopography incorporated
   into scaffolds does not merely improve peripheral nerve regeneration,
   but is in fact a prerequisite for meaningful restoration of nerve
   function. Although the biological mechanisms involved are not fully
   understood, grafts incorporating physical guides that mimic microscopic
   nerve tissue features (e.g., basal laminae) appear to provide a
   significant advantage over grafts that rely on purely chemical or
   macroscopic similarities to nerve tissue. Investigators consistently
   demonstrate the fundamental importance of nano- and micro-scale physical
   features for appropriate cell response in a wide range of biological
   scenarios. Additionally, recent in vivo research demonstrates that nerve
   regeneration scaffolds with cell-scale physical features are more
   effective than those that rely only on chemical or macro-scale features.
   Physical guidance at the cell-scale is especially important for long
   (>20 mm) nerve defects, for which the only reliable treatment is the
   autologous nerve graft. The lack of other available options exposes a
   clear need for the application of nano- and microfabrication techniques
   that will allow the next generation of engineered nerve guides to more
   closely mimic native tissue at those scales. This review examines
   current research to determine what elements of cell-scale topography in
   experimental scaffolds are most effective at stimulating functional
   recovery, and then presents an overview of fabrication techniques that
   could potentially improve future treatment paradigms. Relative
   advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are discussed, with
   respect to both clinical adaptation and likely effectiveness. Our intent
   is to more clearly delineate the remaining obstacles in the development
   of a next generation nerve guide, particularly for long defects, and
   offer new perspectives on steering current technologies towards
   clinically viable solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional micro-scale perfusion-based two-chamber (3D-mu PTC)
   tissue model system was developed to test the cytotoxicity of anticancer
   drugs in conjunction with liver metabolism. Liver cells with different
   cytochrome P450 (CYP) subtypes and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain
   cancer cells were cultured in two separate chambers connected in tandem.
   Both chambers contained a 3D tissue engineering scaffold fabricated with
   biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) using a solvent-free approach. We
   used this model system to test the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs,
   including temozolomide (TMZ) and ifosfamide (IFO). With the liver cells,
   TMZ showed a much lower toxicity to GBM cells under both 20 and 3D cell
   culture conditions. Comparing 2D, GBM cells cultured in 3D had much high
   viability under TMZ treatment. IFO was used to test the CYP-related
   metabolic effects. Cells with different expression levels of CYP3A4
   differed dramatically in their ability to activate IFO, which led to
   strong metabolism-dependent cytotoxicity to GBM cells. These results
   demonstrate that our 3D-mu PTC system could provide a more
   physiologically realistic in vitro environment than the current 2D
   monolayers for testing metabolism-dependent toxicity of anticancer
   drugs. It could therefore be used as an important platform for better
   prediction of drug dosing and schedule towards personalized medicine.

Abstract = {{We develop a locally conservative Eulerian-Lagrangian finite volume
   scheme with the weighted essentially non-oscillatory property (EL-WENO)

   Eulerian-Lagrangian schemes. It is formally high-order accurate in space
   (we present the fifth order version) and essentially non-oscillatory.
   Moreover, it is free of a CFL time step stability restriction and has
   small time truncation error. The scheme requires a new integral-based
   WENO reconstruction to handle trace-back integration. A Strang splitting
   algorithm is presented for higher-dimensional problems, using both the
   new integral-based and pointwise-based WENO reconstructions. We show
   formally that it maintains the fifth order accuracy. It is also locally
   mass conservative. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the
   performance of the scheme and verify its formal accuracy. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The principles of complementary energy in the field of small deformation
   solid mechanics problems are well known. They only involve stress-like
   variables and, furthermore, under the subsidiary conditions of
   equilibrium, they render maximum principles. However, in the
   geometrically non-linear framework, the existence of pure complementary
   energy principles has been subject of discussion since the early 1900s.
   In this work, a pure complementary energy principle, only involving
   internal forces and bending moments as fundamental variables, is
   formulated for geometrically non-linear Euler-Bernoulli beams. This
   principle is derived from the well-known principle of stationary total
   potential energy by resorting to the Legendre transformation and also to
   the so-called Lagrangian multiplier method. In addition, a force-based
   finite element method is derived based on this principle. This method is
   capable of producing numerical solutions that satisfy in strong form the
   equilibrium differential equations, as well as the interelement
   equilibrium and Neumann boundary conditions. To validate and assess the
   accuracy of the proposed method, some numerical examples are analyzed
   and their solutions compared with those obtained using a standard
   displacement-based finite element method. A numerical study of
   convergence of the proposed method is also carried out. (C) 2012

   La1.85Sr1.15Cu2-xCoxO6+delta on the crystal chemistry, thermal and

   reaction (ORR) has been investigated to determine its viability as a
   cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells
   (SOFCs). The larger size and preference for higher oxygen-coordination
   number of the La3+/Sr2+ ions allow intercalation of excess oxygen
   between the two CuO2 layers, and vacancies are introduced into the O(1)
   sites of the CuO2 planes. The La1.85Sr1.15Cu2-xCoxO6+delta oxides show
   thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of similar to 15 x 10(-6) degrees
   C-1 that are compatible with that of the Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC)
   electrolyte in SOFC. Fuel cell data collected with electrolyte-supported
   and anode-supported single cells reveal that the
   La1.85Sr1.15Cu2-xCoxO6+delta + GDC (50:50 vol.\%) composite cathodes
   exhibit lower polarization resistance compared to the pure
   La1.85Sr1.15Cu2-xCoxO6+delta cathodes due to the extended triple phase
   boundary (TPB) where the ORR occurs. Among the various cathode

Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{7138-7145}},

Abstract = {{To better characterize the fundamentals of oxygen scavenging as a means
   to prepare high oxygen barrier polymer films, the oxidation of
   1,4-polybutadiene, in the presence of a transition metal salt catalyst,
   cobalt neodecanoate, was studied at 30 degrees C. Oxygen uptake of
   1,4-polybutadiene films was measured as a function of cobalt
   neodecanoate concentration. In these samples, oxygen mass uptake values
   as high as 15 wt \% were observed, and the kinetics of oxidation were of
   the order of 10 days. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis suggest that the oxidation was
   heterogeneous, with the film surface being highly oxidized and the film
   center being less oxidized. Interestingly, the oxygen uptake exhibited a
   maximum with catalyst loading, which is believed to be related to the
   heterogeneous nature of the oxidation process. Since antioxidants are
   typically added during the industrial scale preparation and the amount
   of antioxidants would affect the oxygen mass uptake value and oxidation
   kinetics, the importance of an antioxidant removal method and a
   normalized purification strategy were determined prior to oxygen uptake
   experiments.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Stoner-Wohlfarth itinerant-electron ferromagnetism has been believed to
   be applicable to the metallic, ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3. A key
   piece of evidence is the linearity of the Arrott plot M-2 versus H/M
   obtained in a previous study. However, a typical Heisenberg behavior
   observed in isostructural BaRuO3 raises a question how the small
   structural change between them can place these compounds into two
   extremes of magnetic interactions. For clarification of this issue, we
   carried out magnetization measurements in the vicinity of T-c for the
   whole series of ferromagnetic ruthenates from Ca0.5Sr0.5RuO3 to SrRuO3
   to BaRuO3. Moreover, we studied the effects of the A-site size variance
   and hydrostatic versus nonhydrostatic pressure on the Arrott plot of
   SrRuO3. Our results reveal that the magnetization behavior as presented
   by the Arrott plot is extremely sensitive to structural distortions. The
   linearity of the Arrott plot for SrRuO3 is actually part of a continuous
   curvature evolution as lattice distortions and spin-orbit coupling
   change; it may have little to do with Stoner-Wohlfarth
   itinerant-electron ferromagnetism. The data for these ruthenates point
   to a distinct phase appearing between localized-electron and broad-band
   behavior that exhibits a strong ferromagnetism stabilized by strong
   correlations among electrons of a narrow band.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) density functionals are popular for
   their ability to improve upon the accuracy of standard semilocal
   functionals such as Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE), particularly for
   semiconductor band gaps. They also have a reduced computational cost
   compared to hybrid functionals, which results from the restriction of
   Fock exchange calculations to small inter-electron separations. These
   functionals are defined by an overall fraction of Fock exchange and a
   length scale for exchange screening. We systematically examine this
   two-parameter space to assess the performance of hybrid screened
   exchange (sX) functionals and to determine a balance between improving
   accuracy and reducing the screening length, which can further reduce
   computational costs. Three parameter choices emerge as useful:
   ``sX-PBE{''} is an approximation to the sX-LDA screened exchange density
   functionals based on the local density approximation (LDA); ``HSE12{''}
   minimizes the overall error over all tests performed; and ``HSE12s{''}
   is a range-minimized functional that matches the overall accuracy of the
   existing HSE06 parameterization but reduces the Fock exchange length
   scale by half. Analysis of the error trends over parameter space
   produces useful guidance for future improvement of density functionals.

Abstract = {{The critical behavior of the paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic
   transition in RMnO3 (R = Sm, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Y) has been
   studied with an ac photopyroelectric calorimeter, which gives
   simultaneously the thermal diffusivity and specific heat as a function
   of temperature with high resolution around the Neel temperature. RMnO3
   (R = Sm, Tb, Dy) has an orthorhombic perovskite structure, whereas the
   other manganites are hexagonal, thus revealing a strong thermal
   anisotropy. SmMnO3 with type-A antiferromagnetic ordering exhibits a
   3D-XY critical behavior, which could be attributed to the peculiar site
   anisotropy of Sm3+ and the exchange interaction between Mn3+ and Sm3+
   ions. The sinusoidal spin ordering in TbMnO3 and DyMnO3 can be
   phenomenologically described by the 3D-Heisenberg model. Finally, the
   hexagonal manganites RMnO3 (R = Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Y) are close to the
   3D-Heisenberg universality class, ruling out the chiral models predicted
   by the renormalization group theory.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving synergy between inexpensive metals and metal oxides is a key
   challenge for the development of highly active, economical catalysts. We
   report the synthesis and characterization of a highly active oxygen
   reduction reaction(ORR) catalyst composed of Ag particles (3 nm) in
   intimate contact with thin (similar to 1 nm) MnOx domains on Vulcan
   carbon (VC) as shown via electron microscopy. A new electroless
   co-deposition scheme, whereby MnO4- ions are reduced by carbon, formed
   nanosized MnOx reduction centers for Ag nanoparticle deposition. A
   bifunctional mechanism for ORR is proposed, in which the HO2-
   intermediate is formed electrochemically and is regenerated via
   disproportionation into OH- and O-2. A 3x mass activity enhancement is
   observed for Ag-MnOx/VC (125 mA/mg(Ag+MnOx)) over the linear combination
   of pure component activities using rotating disk voltammetry. The
   Ag-MnOx/VC mass activity is comparable to commercial Pd/VC (111
   inA/rng(Pd)) and Pt/VC (136 mA/mg(Pt)). Furthermore, the number of
   electrons transferred for ORR reaches 3.5 for Ag-MnOx, higher than for
   MnOx (2.8) and close to the full four-electron ORR. The synergy can be
   rationalized by ensemble effects, where Ag and MnOx domains facilitate
   the formation and disproportionation of HO2-, respectively, and ligand
   effects from the unique electronic interaction at the Ag-MnOx interface.}},

   Extrapolation of the magnetization values measured below the

   on the basis of collinear spin ferrimagnetism from the extrapolated
   magnetic moment values at 0 K agree closely with those obtained from the
   capacity values in the 4 V region of lithium-ion cells. This study
   demonstrates that the magnetic method presented here could become a

   while magnetotransport measurements in bilayer domains defined by a

   in twisted graphene bilayers provides the carrier density in each layer

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5, 1}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Longitudinal monitoring of cells is required in order to understand the
   role of delivered stem cells in therapeutic neovascularization. However,
   there is not an imaging technique that is capable of quantitative,
   longitudinal assessment of stem cell behaviors with high spatial
   resolution and sufficient penetration depth. In this study, in vivo and
   in vitro experiments were performed to demonstrate the efficacy of
   ultrasound-guided photoacoustic (US/PA) imaging to monitor mesenchymal
   stem cells (MSCs) labeled with gold nanotracers (Au NTs). The Au NT
   labeled MSCs, injected intramuscularly in the lower limb of the Lewis
   rat, were detected and spatially resolved. Furthermore, our quantitative
   in vitro cell studies indicate that US/PA imaging is capable of high
   detection sensitivity (1 x 10(4) cells/mL) of the Au NT labeled MSCs.
   Finally, Au NT labeled MSCs captured in the PEGylated fibrin gel system
   were imaged in vivo, as well as in vitro, over a one week time period,
   suggesting that longitudinal cell tracking using US/PA imaging is
   possible. Overall, Au NT labeling of MSCs and US/PA imaging can be an
   alternative approach in stem cell imaging capable of noninvasive,
   sensitive, quantitative, longitudinal assessment of stem cell behaviors
   with high spatial and temporal resolutions at sufficient depths.}},

Abstract = {{Using an ensemble Monte-Carlo analysis, it is found that relaxing the
   constraint of identical barrier heights can result in an improved
   temperature performance. Exploiting this additional design degree of
   freedom, modified structures with non-uniform barrier heights are
   developed based on the current record temperature design. For an
   optimized structure with reduced diagonality, we predict an increase of
   31 K for the maximum operating temperature. Furthermore, we develop
   improved designs with the same oscillator strength as for the reference
   design. Using a genetic algorithm for optimization, an improvement of
   the maximum operating temperature by 38K is obtained. These results aim
   to show the potential of varying the barrier heigths for the design of
   high temperature performance terahertz quantum cascade lasers. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We describe a computational analysis method to evaluate the efficacy of
   immunomagnetic rare cell separation from non-Newtonian particulate blood
   flow. The core procedure proposed here is calculation of local viscosity
   distributions induced by red blood cell (RBC) sedimentation. Numerical
   calculation methods have previously been introduced to simulate
   particulate behavior of individual RBCs. However, due to the limitation
   of the computational power, those studies are typically capable of
   calculating only a very small number (less than 100) of RBCs and are not
   suitable to analyze many practical separation methods for rare cells
   such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We introduce a sedimentation and
   viscosity model based on our experimental measurements. The
   computational field is divided into small unit control volumes, where
   the local viscosity distribution is dynamically calculated based on the
   experimentally found sedimentation model. For analysis of rare cell
   separation, the local viscosity distribution is calculated as a function
   of the volume RBC rate. The direction of gravity has an important role
   in such a sedimentation-involved cell separation system. We evaluated
   the separation efficacy with multiple design parameters including the
   channel design, channel operational orientations (inverted and upright),
   and flow rates. The results showed excellent agreement with real
   experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our computational
   analytical method. We demonstrated higher capture efficiency with the
   inverted microchannel configuration. We conclude that proper direction
   of blood sedimentation significantly enhances separation efficiency in
   microfluidic devices.}},

   casting the solution of PEO10k-b-PFOMA(12k) and PEO20k-b-PFOMA(22k) in
   chloroform with a gold precursor, LiAuCl4. Three annealing modes were
   attempted for the Au-loaded micellar films: solvent vapor annealing,
   supercritical CO2 at 70 degrees C and thermal annealing at 100 degrees
   C. The nanoparticles dispersed in PEO regions were forced to follow the
   morphological change of the PEO phase and grew into larger single
   particles in PEO domains. The solvent annealing produced higher ordering
   of Au nanoparticles than scCO(2) or thermal annealing. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A detailed computational modelling study of the micro-cavity discharge
   (MCD) thruster is presented. The MCD thruster concept incorporates a
   microdischarge with dielectric covered electrodes operated using
   alternating current (ac) excitation. The thruster geometry comprises a
   constant area pipe section followed by a divergent micro-nozzle. Two
   ring electrodes are embedded in the wall of the pipe section with the
   downstream electrode close to the pipe-micronozzle intersection. A
   microdischarge plasma is generated in argon propellant gas flowing
   through the thruster. A detailed plasma dynamics model coupled with the
   compressible Navier-Stokes equations is used to study the flow and
   plasma phenomenon in the thruster. Results show a highly pulsed
   microdischarge with plasma densities of similar to 10(19) m(-3) and
   current densities similar to 700 mA cm(-2) for an ac excitation in the
   radio frequency (RF) regime of 10 and 20 MHz. The dominant gas heating
   mechanism in these discharges is through ion Joule heating. Higher
   electron densities and spatially dominant thermal source terms are
   observed for the 20 MHz excitation compared with 10 MHz excitation. The
   addition of 20\% nitrogen to the flow resulted in much better
   performance compared with the pure argon cases. A peak gas temperature
   rise similar to 200 K is seen for a cycle-averaged power deposition of
   76 mW. For the conditions explored in this study, the overall specific
   impulse of the thruster operating with the microdischarge plasma is
   found to be about 25\% higher than a corresponding cold gas case.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate by
   integrating plasmonic-active SiO2 nanotubes into Si3N4 gratings. First,
   the dielectric grating that is working under guided mode resonance (GMR)
   provides enhanced electric field for localized surface plasmon
   polaritons on the surface of metallic nanoparticles. Second, we use SiO2
   nanotubes with densely assembled silver nanoparticles to provide a large
   amount of ``hot spots{''} without significantly damping the GMR mode of
   the grating. Experimental measurement on Rhodamine-6G shows a constant
   enhancement factor of 8 similar to 10 in addition to the existing SERS
   effect across the entire surface of the SiO2 nanotubes. (C) 2012

Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{We present a method for optimizing transition state theory dividing
   surfaces with support vector machines. The resulting dividing surfaces
   require no a priori information or intuition about reaction mechanisms.
   To generate optimal dividing surfaces, we apply a cycle of
   machine-learning and refinement of the surface by molecular dynamics
   sampling. We demonstrate that the machine-learned surfaces contain the
   relevant low-energy saddle points. The mechanisms of reactions may be
   extracted from the machine-learned surfaces in order to identify
   unexpected chemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we show that the
   machine-learned surfaces significantly increase the transmission
   coefficient for an adatom exchange involving many coupled degrees of
   freedom on a (100) surface when compared to a distance-based dividing
   surface. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Pages = {{249-260}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the dimensionless reaction rate density of a
   two-dimensional channel with catalyst on its boundary was maximized by
   optimizing its aspect ratio H/L. Order of magnitude expressions in the
   limit of small H/L and in the limit of large H/L were developed and then
   intersected to predict the optimal aspect ratio and maximum reaction
   rate. Numerical simulations were performed and the results corroborated
   very well with the scale analysis. The results showed that the optimal
   design of microreactors depends on the Schmidt number (Sc), the Bejan
   number (Be) and the Catalyst number (Ct). Correlations based on those
   numbers are proposed. The analysis was performed for steady-state
   laminar flows, using the dilute species assumption and a first order
   kinetic expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Chance constraints are an important modeling tool in stochastic
   optimization, providing probabilistic guarantees that a solution
   ``succeeds{''} in satisfying a given constraint. Although they control
   the probability of ``success,{''} they provide no control whatsoever in
   the event of a ``failure.{''} That is, they do not distinguish between a
   slight overshoot or undershoot of the bounds and more catastrophic
   violation. In short, they do not capture the magnitude of violation of
   the bounds. This paper addresses precisely this topic, focusing on
   linear constraints and ellipsoidal (Gaussian-like) uncertainties. We
   show that the problem of requiring different probabilistic guarantees at
   each level of constraint violation can be reformulated as a
   semi-infinite optimization problem. We provide conditions that guarantee
   polynomial-time solvability of the resulting semi-infinite formulation.
   We show further that this resulting problem is what has been called a
   comprehensive robust optimization problem in the literature. As a
   byproduct, we provide tight probabilistic bounds for comprehensive
   robust optimization. Thus, analogously to the connection between chance
   constraints and robust optimization, we provide a broader connection
   between probabilistic envelope constraints and comprehensive robust
   optimization.}},

Volume = {{86-87}},
Pages = {{71-86}},

Abstract = {{Reservoir heterogeneities occur over a wide range of length scales, and
   transport process modeling at large-scales requires proper scale-up of
   heterogeneity and its interaction with underlying transport mechanisms.
   This paper demonstrates a new technique to systematically quantify the
   scaling characteristics of mass transfer in heterogeneous reservoirs
   based on the volume averaging approach. Although treatment of transport
   problems with the volume averaging technique has been published in the
   past, application of those methods to geological systems exhibiting
   realistic spatial variability is lacking due to various restrictive
   assumptions in the conventional formulation. We propose a new procedure
   where results from a fine-scale numerical flow simulation reflecting the
   full physics of the transport process albeit over a small sub-volume of
   the reservoir are integrated with the volume averaging technique to
   provide effective description of transport properties and to derive
   scaling relationships of mass transfer coefficient (K-eff) in reservoirs
   exhibiting anisotropic spatial variability. Our results present
   promising potential for application to other complex geologic medium.
   The method is further extended to describe transport in systems
   involving inter-phase transport between multiple flowing phases.
   In particular, the scaling characteristics of K-eff for a tracer
   injection process corresponding to different reservoir heterogeneity
   correlation lengths as well as different transport mechanisms were
   studied. Our results show that scaling of recovery responses (e.g.,
   variances in tracer breakthrough time and recovery) can be described by
   the scaling of K-eff; in particular, mean and variance of K-eff decrease
   with length scale, similar in the fashion of recovery statistics. (C)

Abstract = {{Diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) provides a powerful tool for fast and
   noninvasive disease diagnosis. The ability to leverage DOS to accurately
   quantify tissue optical parameters hinges on the model used to estimate
   light-tissue interaction. We describe the accuracy of a lookup table
   (LUT)-based inverse model for measuring optical properties under
   different conditions relevant to biological tissue. The LUT is a matrix
   of reflectance values acquired experimentally from calibration standards
   of varying scattering and absorption properties. Because it is based on
   experimental values, the LUT inherently accounts for system response and
   probe geometry. We tested our approach in tissue phantoms containing
   multiple absorbers, different sizes of scatterers, and varying oxygen
   saturation of hemoglobin. The LUT-based model was able to extract
   scattering and absorption properties under most conditions with errors
   of less than 5 percent. We demonstrate the validity of the lookup table
   over a range of source-detector separations from 0.25 to 1.48 mm.
   Finally, we describe the rapid fabrication of a lookup table using only
   six calibration standards. This optimized LUT was able to extract
   scattering and absorption properties with average RMS errors of 2.5 and
   4 percent, respectively. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology research and product development are actively conducted
   in many industries, (such as industries that manufacture advanced
   materials and semiconductors) and in medicine. Few studies have
   presented the potential application areas of nanotechnology in, and the
   needs of, the construction industry while identifying the benefits and
   barriers of entry in research and development. Some construction
   industry sectors follow research and development in nanotechnology;
   however, the industry does not take on a leadership role. With proper
   knowledge of the potential products and techniques offered through an
   investment in nanotechnology, the construction industry may potentially
   improve the efficiency of its processes and offer better products to
   clients such as those that exist in building and infrastructure
   construction and in environmental and petroleum engineering. This paper
   analyzes the understanding of nanotechnology in the context of
   construction and explores the current status of nanotechnology in the
   construction industry. Findings from a literature review, from a survey
   among construction industry professionals, and from expert interviews
   with leading researchers in construction-related nanotechnology research
   and development are presented to identify the potential benefits and
   existing barriers of using nanotechnology in construction. A
   multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework was developed to rank
   application areas of nanotechnology that will have major effects in the
   construction industry. Tasks were identified that will make the
   application of nanotechnology in construction successful in the future.

Abstract = {{Calculation of mineral and fluid volumetric concentrations from well
   logs is one of the most important outcomes of formation evaluation.
   Conventional estimation methods assume liner or quasi-linear
   relationships between volumetric concentrations of solid/fluid
   constituents and well logs. Experience shows, however, that the
   relationship between neutron porosity logs and mineral concentrations is
   generally nonlinear. More importantly, linear estimation methods do not
   explicitly account for shoulder-bed and/or invasion effects on well
   logs, nor do they account for differences in the volume of investigation
   of the measurements involved in the estimation. The latter deficiencies
   of linear estimation methods can cause appreciable errors in the
   calculation of porosity and hydrocarbon pore volume. We investigated
   three nonlinear inversion methods for assessment of volumetric
   concentrations of mineral mid fluid constituents of rocks from multiple
   well logs. All three of these methods accounted for the general
   nonlinear relationship between well logs, mineral concentrations, and
   fluid saturations. The first method accounted for the combined effects
   of invasion and shoulder beds on well logs. The second method also
   accounted for shoulder-bed effects but was intended for cases where
   mud-filtrate invasion is negligible or radially deep. Finally, the third
   method was designed specifically for analysis of thick beds where
   mud-filtrate invasion is either negligible or radially deep. Numerical
   synthetic examples of application indicated that nonlinear inversion of
   multiple well logs is a reliable method to quantify complex mineral and
   fluid compositions in the presence of thin beds and invasion. Comparison
   of results against those obtained with conventional multimineral
   estimation methods confirmed the advantage of nonlinear inversion of
   multiple well logs in quantifying thinly bedded invaded formations with
   variable and complex lithology, such as those often encountered in
   carbonate formations.}},

Title = {{Twisted optical metamaterials for planarized ultrathin broadband
   circular polarizers}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Optical metamaterials are usually based on planarized, complex-shaped,
   resonant nano-inclusions. Three-dimensional geometries may provide a
   wider set of functionalities, including broadband chirality to
   manipulate circular polarization at the nanoscale, but their fabrication
   becomes challenging as their dimensions get smaller. Here we introduce a
   new paradigm for the realization of optical metamaterials, showing that
   three-dimensional effects may be obtained without complicated
   inclusions, but instead by tailoring the relative orientation within the
   lattice. We apply this concept to realize planarized, broadband
   bianisotropic metamaterials as stacked nanorod arrays with a tailored
   rotational twist. Because of the coupling among closely spaced twisted
   plasmonic metasurfaces, metamaterials realized with conventional
   lithography may effectively operate as three-dimensional helical
   structures with broadband bianisotropic optical response. The proposed
   concept is also shown to relax alignment requirements common in
   three-dimensional metamaterial designs. The realized sample constitutes
   an ultrathin, broadband circular polarizer that may be directly
   integrated within nanophotonic systems.}},

Abstract = {{When air traffic demand is projected to exceed capacity, the Federal
   Aviation Administration implements traffic flow management (TFM)
   programs. Independently, these programs maintain a first-scheduled,
   first-served invariant, which is the accepted standard of fairness
   within the industry. Coordinating conflicting programs requires a
   careful balance between equity and efficiency. In our work, we first
   develop a fairness metric to measure deviation from first-scheduled,
   first-served in the presence of conflicts. Next, we develop an integer
   programming formulation that attempts to directly minimize this metric.
   We further develop an exponential penalty approach and show that its
   computational performance is far superior and its tradeoff between delay
   and fairness compares favorably. In our results, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of these models using historical and hypothetical
   scenarios. Additionally, we demonstrate that the exponential penalty
   approach exhibits exceptional computational performance, implying
   practical viability. Our results suggest that this approach could lead
   to system-wide savings on the order of \$25 to \$50 million per year.}},

Abstract = {{Flexibly operating CO2 capture at power plants allows a temporary
   increase in electrical output, which could help maintain grid
   reliability, meet peak demand, or improve profitability when electricity
   prices are high. This article presents a versatile optimization model
   that maximizes profits at a fossil-based power plant with CO2 capture by
   operating in response to volatile electricity prices. The model is
   demonstrated for a 500 MW coal-fired unit using 7 molal monoethanolamine
   for post-combustion CO2 capture. The importance of modeling electricity
   price volatility when valuing flexible capture is demonstrated by
   comparing model results to those from a first-order electricity dispatch
   model that does not incorporate price volatility. CO2 emissions and
   plant economics are then compared for operation under three 20-year CO2
   price paths and four facility configurations: no CO2 capture, inflexible
   CO2 capture, flexible CO2 capture that vents CO2 at partial load, and
   flexible capture that uses solvent storage to mitigate venting at
   partial load. Flexible capture improves investment value over inflexible
   capture while maintaining substantial CO2 emissions reductions, but
   economic benefits are greatest at low CO2 prices where CO2 capture
   investment might still be unjustifiable. Flexibility provides the
   greatest economic advantage if CO2 prices are \$40-50 per metric ton of
   CO2 for a substantial portion of plant economic life. Solvent storage
   permits greater operating profits and lower CO2 emissions than a
   venting-only flexible capture facility, but benefits can be offset by
   increased capital costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   patients across the 3 time points. Intraprocedural gaps are more likely
   to be persistent until 12 months and become larger in size over time.
   New gap also occurs during follow-up even if the LAA was completely
   sealed at implantation. One patient had an ischemic stroke 4.7 months
   after implant; another patient developed a left atrial thrombus over the
   device 21.6 months after implant. Both patients had intraprocedural gap
   and discontinued warfarin therapy after the 45-day evaluation.
   Conclusion: Incomplete LAA occlusion with a gap between the WATCHMAN
   device surface and the LAA wall is relatively common. Intraprocedural
   gaps are more likely to become bigger over time and persist, while new
   gaps also occur during follow-up. Further studies are warranted to
   verify whether the presence and persistence of a peridevice gap is
   associated with increased risk of thromboembolic event in AF patients
   implanted with a WATCHMAN device. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 23,
   pp. 455-461, May 2012)}},

   On a GPU-enabled system (NSF's Keeneland at Georgia Tech/ORNL), we
   observed 30x speedup over a single core CPU and 7x speedup over a
   multicore CPU implementation. By combining GPUs with MPI, we achieve
   less than 10 ns/particle and six digits of accuracy for a run with 48

Abstract = {{We address the inverse problem for scattering of acoustic waves due to
   an inhomogeneous medium. We derive and analyze the Hessian in both
   Holder and Sobolev spaces. Using an integral equation approach based on
   Newton potential theory and compact embeddings in Holder and Sobolev
   spaces, we show that the Hessian can be decomposed into two components,
   both of which are shown to be compact operators. Numerical examples are
   presented to validate our theoretical results. The implication of the
   compactness of the Hessian is that for small data noise and model error,
   the discrete Hessian can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. This in
   turn enables fast solution of an appropriately regularized inverse
   problem, as well as Gaussian-based quantification of uncertainty in the
   estimated inhomogeneity.}},

   Bridges}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{A fracture-critical bridge (FCB) is a structure that is expected to
   collapse after the failure of an essential tension component. In the
   positive bending moment region, the bottom flanges of a twin steel
   box-girder bridge are considered to be fracture-critical elements.
   Bridges with fracture-critical elements are required to undergo
   stringent hands-on inspections at least every two years. These
   inspections, which often require lane closures, are labor intensive and
   costly. There have been multiple cases of FCBs that have experienced a
   failure in one of their fracture-critical elements without collapsing,
   which suggests that current provisions may not accurately account for
   the inherent redundancy that exists in various FCB structural systems.
   To improve the understanding of how a twin steel box-girder bridge
   behaves after suffering a full-depth fracture in one of its girders,
   simplified analytical methods have been developed and are presented in
   this paper. The proposed methodology has been validated against data
   from full-scale tests and provides a convenient means for predicting
   response. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000280. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Historical data show that terrorist attacks against transportation
   assets have increased in recent years and that the vast majority of
   these attacks have been bombings. As such, there is growing interest in
   protecting highway infrastructure from blast loads. To address this
   concern, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP)
   sponsored a project to investigate the performance of highway bridges
   subjected to the nearby detonation of an explosive, and this paper
   presents research that advances the understanding of blast loads acting
   on bridge columns. Unlike large wall panels for which much of the
   existing knowledge about blast effects against structures has been
   established, the research presented in this paper focuses on slender
   structural components in which the effects of cross-sectional geometry,
   engulfment of blast pressures, and clearing effects strongly influence
   loading history. Based on the findings obtained from this study, a
   simplified procedure for predicting blast loads acting against bridge

Abstract = {{An important unsolved problem in materials science is prediction of the
   thermodynamic stability of organic crystals and their solubility from
   first principles. Solubility can be defined as the saturating
   concentration of a molecule within a liquid solvent, where the physical
   picture is of solvated molecules in equilibrium with their solid phase.
   Despite the importance of solubility in determining the oral
   bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, prediction tools are currently
   limited to quantitative structure-property relationships that are fit to
   experimental solubility measurements. For the first time, we describe a
   consistent procedure for the prediction of the structure, thermodynamic
   stability, and solubility of organic crystals from molecular dynamics
   simulations using the polarizable multipole AMOEBA force field. Our
   approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard
   state solubility into the sum of solid-vapor sublimation and
   vapor-liquid solvation free energies Delta G(solubility)degrees = Delta
   G(sub)degrees + Delta G(solv)degrees, which are computed via the
   orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) sampling strategy. Application to
   the n-alkylamides series from acetamide through octanamide was selected
   due to the dependence of their solubility on both amide hydrogen bonding
   and the hydrophobic effect, which are each fundamental to protein
   structure and solubility. On average, the calculated absolute standard
   state solubility free energies are accurate to within 1.1 kcal/mol. The
   experimental trend of decreasing solubility as a function of
   n-alkylamide chain length is recapitulated by the increasing stability
   of the crystalline state and to a lesser degree by decreasing
   favorability of solvation (i.e., the hydrophobic effect). Our results
   suggest that coupling the polarizable AMOEBA force field with an
   orthogonal space based free energy algorithm, as implemented in the
   program Force Field X, is a consistent procedure for predicting the
   structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of organic crystals.}},

Abstract = {{We have devised a method to selectively fluorinate graphene by
   irradiating fluoropolymer-covered graphene with a laser. This
   fluoropolymer produces active fluorine radicals under laser irradiation
   that react with graphene but only in the laser-irradiated region. The
   kinetics of C-F bond formation is dependent on both the laser power and
   fluoropolymer thickness, proving that fluorination occurs by the
   decomposition of the fluoropolymer. Fluorination leads to a dramatic
   increase in the resistance of the graphene while the basic skeletal
   structure of the carbon bonding network is maintained. Considering the
   simplicity of the fluorination process and that it allows patterning
   with a nontoxic fluoropolymer as a solid source, this method could find
   application to generate fluorinated graphene in graphene-based
   electronic devices such as for the electrical isolation of graphene.}},

Abstract = {{We report the use of free-standing, lightweight, and highly conductive
   ultrathin graphite foam (UGF), loaded with lithium iron phosphate (LFP),
   as a cathode in a lithium ion battery. At a high charge/discharge
   current density of 1280 mA g(-1), the specific capacity of the LFP
   loaded on UGF was 70 mAh g(-1), while LFP loaded on Al foil failed.
   Accounting for the total mass of the electrode, the maximum specific
   capacity of the UGF/LFP cathode was 23\% higher than that of the Al/LFP
   cathode and 170\% higher than that of the Ni-foam/LFP cathode. Using
   UGF, both a higher rate capability and specific capacity can be achieved
   simultaneously, owing to its conductive (similar to 1.3 x 10(5) S m(-1)
   at room temperature) and three-dimensional lightweight (similar to 9.5
   mg cm(-3)) graphitic structure. Meanwhile, UGF presents excellent
   electrochemical stability comparing to that of Al and Ni foils, which
   are generally used as conductive substrates in lithium ion batteries.
   Moreover, preparation of the UGF electrode was facile, cost-effective,
   and compatible with various electrochemically active materials.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-/nanoscale technologies such as lithographic techniques and
   microfluidics offer promising avenues to revolutionalize the fields of
   tissue engineering, drug discovery, diagnostics and personalized

   delivery applications due to their ability to combine several features
   such as precise shape and size into a single drug delivery vehicle. They
   also offer to create unique asymmetrical features incorporated into
   single or multiple reservoir systems maximizing contact area with the
   intestinal lining. Combined with intelligent materials, such
   microfabricated platforms can be designed to be bioadhesive and
   stimuli-responsive. Apart from drug delivery devices, microfabrication
   technologies offer exciting opportunities to create biomimetic
   gastrointestinal tract models incorporating physiological cell types,
   flow patterns and brush-border like structures. Here we review the
   recent developments in this field with a focus on the applications of
   microfabrication in the development of oral drug delivery devices and
   biomimetic gastrointestinal tract models that can be used to evaluate

Title = {{3D intersegmental knee loading in below-knee amputees across
   steady-state walking speeds}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Background: Unilateral below-knee amputees often develop comorbidities
   that include knee joint disorders (e.g., intact leg knee
   osteoarthritis), with the mechanisms leading to these comorbidities
   being poorly understood. Mechanical knee loading of non-amputees has
   been associated with joint disorders and shown to be influenced by
   walking speed. However, the relationships between amputee knee loading
   and speed have not been identified. This study examined
   three-dimensional mechanical knee loading of amputees across a wide
   range of steady-state walking speeds.
   Methods: Fourteen amputees and 10 non-amputee control subjects were
   analyzed at four overground walking speeds. At each speed,
   intersegmental joint moment and force impulses (i.e., time-integrals
   over the stance phase) were compared between the control, intact and
   residual knees using repeated-measures ANOVAs.
   Findings: There were no differences in joint force impulses between the
   intact and control knees. The intact knee abduction moment impulse was
   lower than the non-amputees at 0.6 and 0.9 m/s. The intact knee flexion
   moment impulses at 0.6, 1.2 and 1.5 m/s and knee external rotation
   moment impulses at all speeds were greater than the residual knee. The
   residual knee extension moment and posterior force impulses were
   insensitive to speed increases, while these quantities increased in
   intact and control knees.
   Interpretation: These results suggest the intact knees of asymptomatic
   and relatively new amputees are not overloaded during walking compared
   to non-amputees. Increased knee loads may develop in response to
   prolonged prosthesis usage or joint disorder onset. Further study is
   needed to determine if the identified bilateral loading asymmetries
   across speeds lead to diminished knee joint health. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper studies the achievable secure rate per source-destination
   pair in wireless networks. First, a path loss model is considered, where
   the legitimate and eavesdropper nodes are assumed to be placed according
   to Poisson point processes with intensities lambda and lambda(e),
   respectively. It is shown that, as long as lambda(e)/lambda = 0 ((log
   n)(-2)), almost all of the nodes achieve a perfectly secure rate of
   Omega(1/root n) for the extended and dense network models. Therefore,
   under these assumptions, securing the network does not entail a loss in
   the per-node throughput. The achievability argument is based on a novel
   multihop forwarding scheme where randomization is added in every hop to
   ensure maximal ambiguity at the eavesdropper(s). Second, an ergodic
   fading model with n source-destination pairs and n(e) eavesdroppers is
   considered. Employing the ergodic interference alignment scheme with an
   appropriate secrecy precoding, each user is shown to achieve a constant
   positive secret rate for sufficiently large n. Remarkably, the scheme
   does not require eavesdropper CSI (only the statistical knowledge is
   assumed) and the secure throughput per node increases as we add more
   legitimate users to the network in this setting. Finally, the effect of
   eavesdropper collusion on the performance of the proposed schemes is
   characterized.}},

Abstract = {{Singular-value decomposition (SVD) {[}and principal component analysis
   (PCA)] is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality
   reduction: successful and efficiently computable, it is nevertheless
   plagued by a well-known, well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent
   work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily
   corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA, such as robust
   collaborative filtering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective
   genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively
   yield entire points that are completely corrupted. We present an
   efficient convex optimization-based algorithm that we call outlier
   pursuit, which under some mild assumptions on the uncorrupted points
   (satisfied, e. g., by the standard generative assumption in PCA
   problems) recovers the exact optimal low-dimensional subspace and
   identifies the corrupted points. Such identification of corrupted points
   that do not conform to the low-dimensional approximation is of paramount
   interest in bioinformatics, financial applications, and beyond. Our
   techniques involve matrix decomposition using nuclear norm minimization;
   however, our results, setup, and approach necessarily differ
   considerably from the existing line of work in matrix completion and
   matrix decomposition, since we develop an approach to recover the
   correct column space of the uncorrupted matrix, rather than the exact
   matrix itself. In any problem where one seeks to recover a structure
   rather than the exact initial matrices, techniques developed thus far
   relying on certificates of optimality will fail. We present an important
   extension of these methods, which allows the treatment of such problems.}},

Abstract = {{Epidermal electronic system (EES) is a class of integrated electronic
   systems that are ultrathin, soft, and lightweight, such that it could be
   mounted to the epidermis based on van der Waals interactions alone, yet
   provides robust, intimate contact to the skin. Recent advances on this
   technology will enable many medical applications such as to monitor
   brain or heart activities, to monitor premature babies, to enhance the
   control of prosthetics, or to realize human-machine interface. In
   particular, the contact between EES and the skin is key to
   high-performance functioning of the above applications and is studied in
   this paper. The mechanics concepts that lead to successful designs of
   EES are also discussed. The results, validated by finite element
   analysis and experimental observations, provide simple, analytical
   guidelines for design and optimization of EES with various possible
   functionalities. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005963]}},

Abstract = {{Polymer nanofoams have recently attracted significant interest in both
   industry and academia. The unique nanoscaled porous structure could
   bring unprecedented material properties that have not been seen in
   conventional or microcellular polymer foams. It has been hypothesized
   that nanofoams could have a much higher specific strength and toughness
   as well as significantly improved thermal resistivity. In this research,
   we study the fabrication and characterization of polyetherimide
   nanofoams using a supercritical carbon dioxide foaming process. A
   process map indicating the conditions to obtain various polyetherimide
   foam structures, including micro-, micro/nano transition, and nanofoams
   has been established. Two types of nanofoams were observed, one made
   with high gas concentrations and the other with high foaming
   temperatures. The one with high gas concentrations exhibited a higher
   specific modulus than that of unfoamed polyetherimide. Nanofoams
   generally showed a higher thermal resistivity than microfoams with
   similar relative densities. It is found that the equilibrium CO2
   concentration in polyetherimide under the supercritical conditions does
   not fit well to the well-known dual-mode sorption model. A new gas
   concentration model was developed to describe the CO2 uptake under
   supercritical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a recently introduced model-based method for
   precedent-free fault detection and isolation (FDI) is modified to deal
   with multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems and is applied to an
   automotive engine with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system. Using
   normal behavior data generated by a high fidelity engine simulation, the
   growing structure multiple model system (GSMMS) approach is used to
   construct dynamic models of normal behavior for the EGR system and its
   constituent subsystems. Using the GSMMS models as a foundation,
   anomalous behavior is detected whenever statistically significant
   departures of the most recent modeling residuals away from the modeling
   residuals displayed during normal behavior are observed. By reconnecting
   the anomaly detectors (ADs) to the constituent subsystems, EGR valve,
   cooler, and valve controller faults are isolated without the need for
   prior training using data corresponding to particular faulty system
   behaviors. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005511]}},

   layers are typically made using a high temperature ( >450 degrees C)
   process in which Cu, In and Ga are sequentially or co-evaporated and
   selenized. We have sought to use CIGS nanocrystals synthesized with the
   desired stoichiometry to deposit PV device layers without high
   temperature processing. This approach, using spray deposition of the
   CIGS light absorber layers, without high temperature selenization, has
   enabled up to 3.1\% power conversion efficiency under AM 1.5 solar
   illumination. Although the device efficiency is too low for
   commercialization, these devices provide a proof-of-concept that
   solution-deposited CIGS nanocrystal films can function in PV devices,
   enabling unconventional device architectures and materials combinations,
   including the use of flexible, inexpensive and light-weight plastic
   substrates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Asphalt mixtures are complex composites that comprise aggregate, asphalt
   binder, and air. Several research studies have shown that the mechanical
   behavior of the asphalt mixture is strongly influenced by the matrix,
   i.e. the asphalt binder. Characterization and a thorough understanding
   of the binder behavior is the first and crucial step towards developing
   an accurate constitutive model for the composite. Accurate constitutive
   models for the constituent materials are critical to ensure accurate
   performance predictions at a material and structural level using
   micromechanics. This paper presents the findings from a systematic
   investigation into the nature of the linear and nonlinear response of
   asphalt binders subjected to different types of loading using the
   Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). Laboratory test data show that a
   compressive normal force is generated in an axially constrained specimen
   subjected to torsional shear. This paper investigates the source of this
   normal force and demonstrates that the asphalt binder can dilate when
   subjected to shear loads. This paper also presents the findings from a
   study conducted to investigate the source of the nonlinearity in the
   asphalt binder. Test results demonstrate that the application of cyclic
   shear loads results in the development of a normal force and a
   concomitant reduction in the dynamic shear modulus. This form of
   nonlinear response is referred to as an ``interaction nonlinearity{''}.
   A combination of experimental and analytical tools is used to
   demonstrate and verify the presence of this interaction nonlinearity in
   asphalt binders. The findings from this study highlight the importance
   of modeling the mechanical behavior of asphalt binders based on the
   overall stress state of the material.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a hyperspectral microscopic imaging (HMI) plafform that can
   precisely identify and quantify 10 molecular markers in individual
   cancer cells in a single pass. The exploitation of an improved
   separation of circulating tumor cells and the application of HMI
   provided an opportunity (1) to identify molecular changes in these
   cells, (2) to recognize the coexpression of these markers, (3) to pose
   an important opportunity for noninvasive diagnosis, and (4) to use
   targeted therapy. We balanced the intensity of 10 fluorochromes bound to
   10 different antibodies, each specific to a particular tumor marker, so
   that the intensity of each fluorochrome can be discerned from
   overlapping emissions. Using 2 touch preps from each primary breast
   cancer, the average molecular marker intensities of 25 tumor cells gave
   a representative molecular signature for the tumor despite some cellular
   heterogeneity. The intensities determined by the HMI correlate well with
   the conventional 0-3+ analysis by experts in cellular pathology. Because
   additional multiplexes can be developed using the same fluorochromes but
   different antibodies, this analysis allows quantification of many
   molecular markers on a population of tumor cells. HMI can be automated
   completely, and eventually, it could allow the standardization of
   protein biomarkers and improve reproducibility among clinical pathology
   laboratories. (Translational Research 2012;159:366-375)}},

Abstract = {{The effects of black carbon (BC) on resistant desorption of organic
   pollutants in soil and sediment were evaluated to further understand the
   mechanisms for the resistant desorption and to find a more accurate
   desorption model which can improve risk assessment and management of
   ubiquitous soil/sediment contamination.
   A soil and sediment were used to create ``combusted{''} soil/sediment
   with only BC and no other organic matter remaining by 375A degrees C
   chemothermal oxidation (CTO-375) method. Polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) including naphthalene and phenanthrene were used as
   sorbates, their sorption and desorption by the original soil/sediment
   (with organic matter and BC), and combusted soil/sediment (only BC) were
   examined.
   All sorption isotherms were fitted with linear model and Freundlich
   model. Sorption isotherms of naphthalene and phenanthrene on the
   original soil/sediment were almost linear (Freundlich coefficient n =
   0.86, 1.00, 0.87, and 0.75), whereas the BC remaining after the
   soil/sediment combustion showed nonlinear (n = 0.70, 0.48, 0.56, and
   0.55) and higher sorption (e.g., K-OC = 1.36 x 10(4) with naphthalene
   equilibrium solution concentration of 0.001 mg l(-1) for combusted soil,
   one order higher than that for the original sample accordingly).
   Desorption resistance was observed for both the original and combusted
   soil/sediment, and the resistant desorption from combusted soil/sediment
   was much stronger than that from original soil/sediment based on the
   quantification of desorption hysteresis with thermodynamic index of
   irreversibility (TII) values (TII = 0.73-0.88). A biphasic desorption
   isotherm can well describe the resistant desorption for all PAH-sorbent
   combinations.
   The BC could have significant effect on desorption of PAHs from soil and
   sediment, the BC fraction in soils and sediments could be the
   predominant component responsible for desorption hysteresis. More
   accurate biphasic desorption models can be used to improve risk
   assessment and management of ubiquitous soils/sediments contamination by
   PAHs.}},

Abstract = {{An emerging interest in transport research concerns the factors that can
   help to create strong, sustainable and `livable' communities; however,
   relatively limited empirical work has been conducted to date. In this
   paper the perception of sense of community among neighbourhood residents
   is investigated. Drawing from research on tertiary street-communities
   (t-communities), the paper explores the effect of the urban landscape,
   particularly street networks, and neighbourhood and individual
   characteristics on sense of community. A sample of students at McMaster
   University in Hamilton, Canada, is used for the analysis. In addition to
   providing an opportunity to study sense of community, a student sample
   is interesting in its own right, as students are often a component of
   essential but at times uneasy relations between universities and towns.
   Analysis is based on the application of an ordered probit model with a
   spatial lag. The results provide evidence that t-community membership
   can influence sense of community.}},

   of the crosslinking density. Similarities were observed in the penetrant

Abstract = {{A temperature-responsive pentablock copolymer (PB) was designed to
   deliver DNA and provide pro-longed gene expression by forming a
   thermogelling release depot after subcutaneous or intratumoral
   injection. A synthetic barrier gel was developed based on poly(ethylene
   glycol) diacrylate to enable the released vectors to instantly and
   continuously transfect cultured cells. The aim of this setup was to
   provide a simple and controlled in vitro system to mimic tumor matrix to
   optimize the release system and to study the influence of the continuous
   and sustained release of the polyplexes on the in vitro transfection.
   The porosity of the barrier gel was adjusted by addition and removal of
   Pluronic F127 (PL), and the properties of the gel were characterized by
   visual inspection and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Concentrated
   PB-based vector was administered to the barrier gel and allowed to be
   released to the buffer. We found that most of feed vector could be
   released from the barrier gel without unpacking the polymer-DNA
   complexes. Based on the specific construction of the PB-based vectors,
   an anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) was further loaded into the same
   vector designed for DNA delivery, thus formulating a gene and drug
   co-delivery system. This system was tested for sustained delivery to
   human ovarian carcinoma cells SKOV3 using the barrier gel in vitro as a
   tumor mimic. Transfection efficiency was found to be significantly
   enhanced by co-delivering PTX, while PTX also showed its effect as an
   anti-cancer drug to induce cell death. Yet both of the two effects of
   PTX shown in SKOV3 cells turned out to be dramatically weaker in ARPE-19
   cells, a human non-cancerous cell line, which might be related to the
   nature of the vector itself. Instant release of vectors showed the
   ability to maintain transfection up to the fourth day, making the gene
   expression stable at least for the first 5 days. Further study is still
   needed to improve the duration of effective release. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The success of drug eluting stents (DESs) has been challenged by the
   manifestation of late stent thrombosis after DES implantation. The
   incomplete regeneration of the endothelial layer poststenting triggers
   adverse signaling processes precipitating in thrombosis. Various
   approaches have been attempted to prevent thrombosis, including the
   delivery of biological agents, such as estradiol, that promote
   endothelialization, and the use of natural polymers as coating
   materials. The underlying challenge has been the inability to release
   the biological agent in synchronization with the temporal sequence of
   vascular wound healing in vivo. The natural healing process of the
   endothelium after an injury starts after a week and may take up to a
   month in humans. This article presents a novel DES formulation using a
   hemocompatible polyurethane (PU) matrix to sustain the release of
   probucol (PB), an endothelial agonist, by exploiting the greater
   difference in the solubility parameters of PB and PU. This results in
   the formation of crystalline PB aggregates retarding drug release from
   PU. The physicochemical properties of PB in PU were confirmed using
   differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. Drug-polymer
   compatibility was examined using infrared spectral analysis. Also, in
   vitro studies using primary human aortic endothelial cells resulted in
   the selection of 5\% w/w PB as the optimal dose, to be further tested in
   vitro and in vivo. This work develops and tests a promising new DES
   formulation to enable faster endothelial cell proliferation
   poststenting, potentially minimizing the incidence and severity of
   thrombotic events after DES implantation. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The objective in this paper is to analyze some stochastic models for
   estimating the ionization reaction rate constant of atomic Nitrogen (N +
   e(-) -> N+ + 2e(-)). Parameters of the models are identified by means of
   Bayesian inference using spatially resolved absolute radiance data
   obtained from the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) wind-tunnel. The
   proposed methodology accounts for uncertainties in the model parameters
   as well as physical model inadequacies, providing estimates of the rate
   constant that reflect both types of uncertainties. We present four
   different probabilistic models by varying the error structure (either
   additive or multiplicative) and by choosing different descriptions of
   the statistical correlation among data points. In order to assess the
   validity of our methodology, we first present some calibration results
   obtained with manufactured data and then proceed by using experimental
   data collected at EAST experimental facility. In order to simulate the
   radiative signature emitted in the shock-heated air plasma, we use a
   one-dimensional flow solver with Park's two-temperature model that
   simulates non-equilibrium effects. We also discuss the implications of
   the choice of the stochastic model on the estimation of the reaction
   rate and its uncertainties. Our analysis shows that the stochastic
   models based on correlated multiplicative errors are the most plausible
   models among the four models proposed in this study. The rate of the
   atomic Nitrogen ionization is found to be (6.2 +/- 3.3) x 10(11) cm(3)

Abstract = {{The anomalous reactive transport considered here is the migration of
   contaminants through strongly sorbing permeable media without
   significant retardation. It has been observed in the case of heavy
   metals, organic compounds, and radionuclides, and it has critical
   implications on the spreading of contaminant plumes and on the design of
   remediation strategies. Even in the absence of the well-known fast
   migration pathways, associated with fractures and colloids, anomalous
   reactive transport arises in numerical simulations of reactive flow. It
   is due to the presence of highly pH-dependent adsorption and the
   broadening of the concentration front by hydrodynamic dispersion. This
   leads to the emergence of an isolated pulse or wave of a contaminant
   traveling at the average flow velocity ahead of the retarded main
   contamination front. This wave is considered anomalous because it is not
   predicted by the classical theory of chromatography, unlike the
   retardation of the main contamination front. In this study, we use the
   theory of chromatography to study a simple pH-dependent surface
   complexation model to derive the mathematical framework for the
   anomalous transport. We analyze the particular case of strontium (Sr2+)
   transport and define the conditions under which the anomalous transport
   arises. We model incompressible one-dimensional (1D) flow through a
   reactive porous medium for a fluid containing four aqueous species: H+,
   Sr2+, Na+, and Cl-. The mathematical problem reduces to a strictly
   hyperbolic 2 x 2 system of conservation laws for effective anions and
   Sr2+, coupled through a competitive Langmuir isotherm. One
   characteristic field is linearly degenerate while the other is not
   genuinely nonlinear due to an inflection point in the pH-dependent
   isotherm. We present the complete set of analytical solutions to the
   Riemann problem, consisting of only three combinations of a slow wave
   comprising either a rarefaction, a shock, or a shock-rarefaction with
   fast wave comprising only a contact discontinuity. Highly resolved
   numerical solutions at large P,clet numbers show excellent agreement
   with the analytic solutions in the hyperbolic limit. In the Riemann
   problem, the anomalous wave forms only if: hydrodynamic dispersion is
   present, the slow wave crosses the inflection locus, and the effective
   anion concentration increases along the fast path.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a unified framework to understand the weekday
   recreational activity participation time-use of adults, with an emphasis
   on the time expended in physically active recreation pursuits by
   location and by time-of-day. Such an analysis is important for a better
   understanding of how individuals incorporate physical activity into
   their daily activities on a typical weekday, and can inform the
   development of effective policy interventions to facilitate physical
   activity. Furthermore, such a study of participation and time use in
   recreational activity episodes contributes to activity-based travel
   demand modeling, since recreational activity participation comprises a
   substantial share of individuals' total non-work activity participation.
   The methodology employed here is the multiple discrete continuous
   extreme value (MDCEV) model, which provides a unified framework to
   explicitly and endogenously examine time use by type, location, and
   timing. The data for the empirical analysis is drawn from the 2000 Bay
   Area Travel Survey (BATS), supplemented with other secondary sources
   that provide information on physical environment variables. To our
   knowledge, this is the first study to jointly address the issues of
   `where', `when' and `how much' individuals choose to participate in
   `what type of (recreational) activity'.}},

Abstract = {{The current article proposes an approach to accommodate flexible spatial
   dependency structures in discrete choice models in general, and in
   unordered multinomial choice models in particular. The approach is
   applied to examine teenagers' participation in social and recreational
   activity episodes, a subject of considerable interest in the
   transportation, sociology, psychology, and adolescence development
   fields. The sample for the analysis is drawn from the 2000 San Francisco
   Bay Area Travel Survey (BATS) as well as other supplementary data
   sources. The analysis considers the effects of a variety of built
   environment and demographic variables on teenagers' activity behavior.
   In addition, spatial dependence effects (due to common unobserved
   residential neighborhood characteristics as well as
   diffusion/interaction effects) are accommodated. The variable effects
   indicate that parents' physical activity participation constitutes the
   most important factor influencing teenagers' physical activity
   participation levels, In addition, part-time student status, gender, and
   seasonal effects are also important determinants of teenagers'
   social-recreational activity participation. The analysis also finds
   strong spatial correlation effects in teenagers' activity participation
   behaviors.}},

Title = {{Competitive separation of di- vs. mono-valent cations in
   electrodialysis: Effects of the boundary layer properties}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2042-2056}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{In electrodialysis desalination, the boundary layer near ion-exchange
   membranes is the limiting region for the overall rate of ionic
   separation due to concentration polarization over tens of micrometers in
   that layer. Under high current conditions, this sharp concentration
   gradient, creating substantial ionic diffusion, can drive a preferential
   separation for certain ions depending on their concentration and
   diffusivity in the solution. Thus, this study tested a hypothesis that
   the boundary layer affects the competitive transport between di- and
   mono-valent cations, which is known to be governed primarily by the
   partitioning with cation-exchange membranes. A laboratory-scale
   electrodialyzer was operated at steady state with a mixture of 10 mM KCl
   and 10 mM CaCl2 at various flow rates. Increased flows increased the
   relative calcium transport. A two-dimensional model was built with
   analytical solutions of the Nemst-Planck equation. In the model, the
   boundary layer thickness was considered as a random variable defined
   with three statistical parameters: mean, standard deviation, and
   correlation coefficient between the thicknesses of the two boundary
   layers facing across a spacer. Model simulations with the Monte Carlo
   method found that a greater calcium separation was achieved with a
   smaller mean, greater standard deviation, or more negative correlation
   coefficient. The model and experimental results were compared for the
   cationic transport number as well as the current and potential
   relationship. The mean boundary layer thickness was found to decrease
   from 40 to less than 10 mu m as the superficial water velocity increased
   from 1.06 to 4.24 cm/s. The standard deviation was greater than the mean
   thickness at slower water velocities and smaller at faster water
   velocities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Amine scrubbing will be an important technology for CO2 capture and

   thermal degradation. Primary and secondary ethanolamines and
   ethylenediamines degrade at 100-130 degrees C as they form cyclic
   oxazolidinones and ureas. Tertiary amines can be more resistant to
   degradation if they do not include methyl and ethanol groups. Piperazine
   structures and long chain diamines such as hexamethylenediamine degrade
   by ring opening and closing and can be used at 150-160 degrees C.
   Thermal degradation can produce products that are more volatile than the

   shape scattering of acoustic waves}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We derive expressions for the shape Hessian operator of the data misfit
   functional corresponding to the inverse problem of inferring the shape
   of a scatterer from reflected acoustic waves, using a Banach space
   setting and the Lagrangian approach. The shape Hessian is then analyzed
   in both Holder and Sobolev spaces. Using an integral equation approach
   and compact embeddings in Holder and Sobolev spaces, we show that the
   shape Hessian can be decomposed into four components, of which the
   Gauss-Newton part is a compact operator, while the others are not. Based
   on the Hessian analysis, we are able to express the eigenvalues of the
   Gauss-Newton Hessian as a function of the smoothness of the shape space,
   which shows that the smoother the shape is, the faster the decay rate.
   Analytical and numerical examples are presented to validate our
   theoretical results. The implication of the compactness of the
   Gauss-Newton Hessian is that for small data noise and model error, the
   discrete Hessian can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. This in turn
   enables fast solution of an appropriately regularized inverse problem,
   as well as Gaussian-based quantification of uncertainty in the estimated
   shape.}},

Abstract = {{Natural polymers over the years have gained more importance because of
   their host biocompatibility and ability to interact with cells in vitro
   and in vivo. An area of research that holds promise in regenerative
   medicine is the combinatorial use of novel biomaterials and stem cells.
   A fundamental strategy in the field of tissue engineering is the use of
   three-dimensional scaffold (e.g., decellularized extracellular matrix,
   hydrogels, micro/nano particles) for directing cell function. This
   technology has evolved from the discovery that cells need a substrate
   upon which they can adhere, proliferate, and express their
   differentiated cellular phenotype and function(2-3). More recently, it
   has also been determined that cells not only use these substrates for
   adherence, but also interact and take cues from the matrix substrate
   (e.g., extracellular matrix, ECM)(4). Therefore, the cells and scaffolds
   have a reciprocal connection that serves to control tissue development,
   organization, and ultimate function. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)
   are mesenchymal, non-hematopoetic stem cells present in adipose tissue
   that can exhibit multi-lineage differentiation and serve as a readily
   available source of cells (i.e. pre-vascular endothelia and pericytes).
   Our hypothesis is that adipose-derived stem cells can be directed toward
   differing phenotypes simultaneously by simply co-culturing them in
   bilayered matrices(1). Our laboratory is focused on dermal wound
   healing. To this end, we created a single composite matrix from the
   natural biomaterials, fibrin, collagen, and chitosan that can mimic the
   characteristics and functions of a dermal-specific wound healing ECM
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid flocculation of nanoparticle dispersions of a poorly water soluble
   drug, itraconazole (Itz), was utilized to produce amorphous powders with
   desirable dissolution properties for high bioavailability in rats.
   Antisolvent precipitation (AP) was utilized to form Itz nanodispersions
   with high drug loadings stabilized with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
   (HPMC) or the pH-sensitive Eudragit (R) L100-55 (EL10055). The HPMC
   dispersions were flocculated by desolvating the polymer through the
   addition of a divalent salt, and the enteric EL10055 by reducing the pH.
   The formation of open flocs by diffusion limited aggregation facilitated
   redispersion of the flocs at pH 6.8. Upon redispersion of the
   flocculated nanoparticles at pH 6.8, the particle size was modestly
   larger than the original size, on the order of 1 mu m. High in vitro
   supersaturation (AUC) of the flocculated nanoparticle dispersions was
   observed in micellar media at pH 6.8, after 2 hours initial exposure at
   pH 1.2 to simulate the stomach, relative to the AUC for a commercially
   available Itz formulation, Sporanox. Greater in vivo bioavailability in
   rats was correlated directly to the higher in vitro AUC at pH 6.8 with
   micelles during the pH shift experiment for the flocculated nanoparticle
   dispersions relative to Sporanox. The ability to generate and sustain
   high supersaturation in micellar media at pH 6.8, as shown with the in
   vitro pH shift dissolution test, is beneficial for increasing
   bioavailability of Itz by oral delivery.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic modulus of ultra-thin amorphous carbon films was
   investigated by integrating atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging in

   mechanical characterization. The deformation of these ultra-thin
   membranes was measured by recording topography images at different
   normal loads using contact mode AFM. The obtained force-distance
   relationship at the center of membranes was analyzed to evaluate both
   the Young's modulus and pre-stress by FEA. From these measurements,
   Young's moduli of 178.9 +/- 32.3, 193.4 +/- 20.0, and 211.1 +/- 44.9 GPa
   were obtained for 3.7 +/- 0.08, 6.8 +/- 0.12, and 10.4 +/- 0.17 nm thick
   membranes, respectively. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{A model is developed and solved analytically and numerically to describe
   the barrier properties of multilayer films with alternating reactive and
   inert layers. Incorporation of reactive scavenging sites in packaging
   materials can significantly improve their barrier properties. Due to
   mechanical and optical requirements, barrier films typically consist of
   polymer blends or multilayer films of the scavenging material and an
   inert supporting polymer. Because composite reactive barriers are
   expected to operate for months or years, purely experimental
   characterization is not practical and models are needed to optimize the
   configurations and to confidently extrapolate experimental data. The
   model for multilayer films is solved numerically over a wide parameter
   space, varying physical properties and layer configuration to determine
   the flux and time lag. Asymptotic analysis of the model is used to
   develop analytical predictions for transport behavior at early and long
   times. The performance of multilayer composites is compared to polymer
   blends and discussion of the most suitable configuration for different
   scenarios is presented. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{We have used molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the interfacial
   tension of hydroxylated SiO2 nanoparticles under different temperatures
   and solutions (helium and brine with monovalent and divalent salts). In
   order to benchmark the atomistic model, quartz SiO2 interfacial tension
   was measured based on inverse gas chromatography under He atmosphere.
   The experimental interfacial tension values for quartz were found
   between 0.512 and 0.617 N/m. Our calculated results for the interfacial
   tension of silica nanoparticles within helium atmosphere was 0.676 N/m,
   which is higher than the value found for the system containing
   He/alpha-quartz (0.478 N/m), but it is similar to the one found for
   amorphous silica surface. We have also studied the interfacial tension
   of the nanoparticles in electrolyte aqueous solution for different types
   and salts concentrations (NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2). Our calculations
   indicate that adsorption properties and salt solutions greatly influence
   the interfacial tension in an order of CaCl2 > MgCl2 > NaCl. This effect
   is due to the difference in distribution of ions in solution, which
   modifies the hydration and electrostatic potential of those ions near
   the nanoparticle. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells
   enable the in vivo study of human hematopoiesis. In particular,
   NOD-scid-IL2R gamma(null) engrafted mice have been shown to have
   reasonable levels of T and B cell repopulation and can mount T-cell
   dependent responses; however, antigen-specific B-cell responses in this
   model are generally poor. We explored whether developmental defects in
   the immunoglobulin gene repertoire might be partly responsible for the
   low level of antibody responses in this model. Roche 454 sequencing was
   used to obtain over 685,000 reads from cDNA encoding immunoglobulin
   heavy (IGH) and light (IGK and IGL) genes isolated from immature, naive,
   or total splenic B cells in engrafted NOD-scid-IL2R gamma(null) mice,
   and compared with over 940,000 reads from peripheral B cells of two
   healthy volunteers. We find that while naive B-cell repertoires in
   humanized mice are chiefly indistinguishable from those in human blood B
   cells, and display highly correlated patterns of immunoglobulin gene
   segment use, the complementarity-determining region H3 (CDR-H3)
   repertoires are nevertheless extremely diverse and are specific for each
   individual. Despite this diversity, preferential D-H-J(H) pairings
   repeatedly occur within the CDR-H3 interval that are strikingly similar
   across all repertoires examined, implying a genetic constraint imposed
   on repertoire generation. Moreover, CDR-H3 length, charged amino-acid
   content, and hydropathy are indistinguishable between humans and
   humanized mice, with no evidence of global autoimmune signatures.
   Importantly, however, a statistically greater usage of the inherently
   autoreactive IGHV4-34 and IGKV4-1 genes was observed in the newly formed
   immature B cells relative to naive B or total splenic B cells in the
   humanized mice, a finding consistent with the deletion of autoreactive B
   cells in humans. Overall, our results provide evidence that key features
   of the primary repertoire are shaped by genetic factors intrinsic to
   human B cells and are principally unaltered by differences between mouse
   and human stromal microenvironments.}},

Title = {{Linking Yeast Gcn5p Catalytic Function and Gene Regulation Using a
   Quantitative, Graded Dominant Mutant Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{Establishing causative links between protein functional domains and
   global gene regulation is critical for advancements in genetics,
   biotechnology, disease treatment, and systems biology. This task is
   challenging for multifunctional proteins when relying on traditional
   approaches such as gene deletions since they remove all domains
   simultaneously. Here, we describe a novel approach to extract
   quantitative, causative links by modulating the expression of a dominant
   mutant allele to create a function-specific competitive inhibition.
   Using the yeast histone acetyltransferase Gcn5p as a case study, we
   demonstrate the utility of this approach and (1) find evidence that
   Gcn5p is more involved in cell-wide gene repression, instead of the
   accepted gene activation associated with HATs, (2) identify previously
   unknown gene targets and interactions for Gcn5p-based acetylation, (3)
   quantify the strength of some Gcn5p-DNA associations, (4) demonstrate
   that this approach can be used to correctly identify canonical chromatin
   modifications, (5) establish the role of acetyltransferase activity on
   synthetic lethal interactions, and (6) identify new functional classes

Abstract = {{A sulfur-polypyrrole composite consisting of orthorhombic bipyramidal
   sulfur particles (63.3 wt \%) coated with a polypyrrole nanolayer has
   been synthesized by a low-cost, scalable, environmentally benign process
   and investigated as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries. Cathodes
   containing the sulfur-polypyrrole composite have been evaluated in half
   cells by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling, and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. The sulfur-polypyrrole composite cathode shows
   better electrochemical stability, cyclability, and rate capability than
   pristine sulfur as the polypyrrole coating acts as a conductive matrix
   for electron transfer while prohibiting lithium polysulfide dissolution.
   At C/5 rate, the sulfur-polypyrrole composite cathode exhibits similar
   to 200 mAh/g higher capacity than the pristine sulfur after 50 cycles.
   At C/2 and 1C rates, the composite shows significantly better capacity
   retention than the pristine sulfur over 100 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial gas separation membranes have selective dense layers with
   thicknesses around 100 nm. It has long been assumed that these thin
   layers have the same properties as thick (bulk) films. However, recent
   research has shown that thin films with such thickness experience
   accelerated physical aging relative to bulk films and, thus, their
   permeation properties can differ significantly from the bulk. Thin films
   made from Extem (R) XH 1015, a new commercial polyetherimide, have been
   investigated by monitoring their gas permeability. The permeability of
   the thin films is originally greater than the thick films but eventually
   decreases well below the permeability of the thick film. The CO2
   plasticization of Extem thin films is explored using a series of
   exposure protocols that indicate CO2 plasticization is a function of
   film thickness, aging time, exposure time, pressure and prior history.

Title = {{A sub-grid scale closure for nonlinear hillslope sediment transport
   models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Hillslope sediment transport models express the sediment flux at a point
   as a function of some topographic attributes of the system, such as
   slope, curvature, soil thickness, etc., at that point only (referred
   here as ``local{''} transport models) or at an appropriately defined
   vicinity of that point (referred here as ``nonlocal{''} transport
   models). Typically, topographic attributes are computed from digital
   elevation data (DEMs) and thus their estimates depend on the DEM
   resolution (1 m, 10 m, 90 m, etc.) rendering any sediment flux
   computation scale-dependent. Often calibration compensates for this
   scale-dependence resulting in effective parameterizations with limited
   physical meaning. In this paper, we demonstrate the scale-dependence of
   local nonlinear hillslope sediment flux models and derive a subgrid
   scale closure via upscaling. We parameterize the subgrid scale closure
   in terms of the low resolution, resolved topographic attributes of the
   landscape, thus allowing the reliable computation of a scale-independent
   sediment flux from low resolution digital elevation data. We also show
   that the accuracy of the derived subgrid scale closure model depends on
   the dimensionless erosion rate and the dimensionless relief of any given
   basin. Finally, we present theoretical arguments and demonstrate that
   the recently proposed nonlocal sediment flux models are
   scale-independent. These concepts are demonstrated via an application on
   a small basin (MR1) of the central Oregon Coast Range using
   high-resolution lidar topographic data.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the role of
   heparanase in controlling thrombosis following vascular injury or
   endovascular stenting.
   Background The use of endovascular stents are a common clinical
   intervention for the treatment of arteries occluded due to vascular
   disease. Both heparin and heparan sulfate are known to be potent
   inhibitors of thrombosis. Heparanase is the major enzyme that degrades
   heparan sulfate in mammalian cells. This study examined the role of
   heparanase in controlling thrombosis following vascular injury and
   stent-induced flow disturbance.
   Methods This study used mice overexpressing human heparanase and
   examined the time to thrombosis using a laser-induced arterial
   thrombosis model in combination with vascular injury. An ex vivo system
   was used to examine the formation of thrombus to stent-induced flow
   disturbance.
   Results In the absence of vascular injury, wild type and heparanase
   overexpressing (HPA Tg) mice had similar times to thrombosis in a
   laser-induced arterial thrombosis model. However, in the presence of
   vascular injury, the time to thrombosis was dramatically reduced in HPA
   Tg mice. An ex vivo system was used to flow blood from wild type and HPA
   Tg mice over stents and stented arterial segments from both animal
   types. These studies demonstrate markedly increased thromboses on stents
   with blood isolated from HPA Tg mice in comparison to blood from wild
   type animals. We found that blood from HPA Tg animals had markedly
   increased thrombosis when applied to stented arterial segments from
   either wild type or HPA Tg mice.
   Conclusions Taken together, this study's results indicate that
   heparanase is a powerful mediator of thrombosis in the context of
   vascular injury and stent-induced flow disturbance. (J Am Coll Cardiol

Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{The physical aging of polystyrene (PS) confined in a multilayered film
   arrangement was explored using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
   The multilayered films were produced via multilayer coextrusion and
   consisted of alternating layers of PS and polycarbonate (PC), with PS
   layer thicknesses ranging from 50 nm to 500 nm. A 125 mu m bulk control
   film of pure PS was also extruded and studied for comparison. The glass
   transition temperatures (T-g) of the PS in multilayered films did not
   appear to be systematically dependent on layer thickness, and T-g values
   in all PS/PC films were similar to the bulk value of 104 degrees C. Two
   approaches were used to investigate the structural relaxation of PS in
   the layered films. In the first method, PS layers were aged isothermally
   at 80 degrees C after annealing above the T-g of PS (135 degrees C for
   15 min) to reset the thermal history and provide a well-defined starting
   point for aging experiments. Recovered enthalpy data for aged films
   (calculated from DSC thermograms) showed that the aging rate in the PS
   layers decreased with decreasing layer thickness. Calculated aging rates
   were also compared with the fraction of interphase material (which
   increases significantly with decreasing layer thickness), and the
   decrease in aging rate for films with thinner layers was found to
   correlate with an increase in interphase fraction. The elevated T-g of
   the interphase material (compared to pure PS) was suggested as a
   possible reason for reduced aging rates in the thin PS layers. In the
   second method, PS layers were cooled from above their T-g at different
   rates under confinement by PC layers. After this cooling step was
   performed, subsequent heating thermograms revealed that the enthalpy
   recovered upon reheating through the T-g of PS was similar for bulk and
   nanolayered films. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Herein we propose a new structure for poly(dopamine), a synthetic
   eumelanin that has found broad utility as an antifouling agent.
   Commercially available 3-hydroxytyramine hydrochloride (dopamine HCl)
   was polymerized under aerobic, aqueous conditions using
   tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) as a basic polymerization
   initiator, affording a darkly colored powder product upon isolation. The
   polymer was analyzed using a variety of solid state spectroscopic and
   crystallographic techniques. Collectively, the data showed that in
   contrast to previously proposed models, poly(dopamine) is not a covalent
   polymer but instead a supramolecular aggregate of monomers (consisting

Abstract = {{Graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition on a Cu foil and transferred
   onto a Si wafer has been used to fabricate a field effect transistor
   device that was used to study the sensing of SO2 gas. It was found by
   in-situ measurements that the SO2 strongly p-dopes the graphene and
   dramatically shifts its Dirac point. This effect was used to monitor the
   SO2 gas. The detector can be completely reset by thermal annealing at
   100 degrees C in high vacuum. The response and recovery of the detector
   are faster at higher temperatures. Moreover, the sensitivity of the SO2
   graphene detector increases proportionally with increasing temperature.

Abstract = {{Synthetic alkane-inducible biosensors have applications as detectors for
   environmental hydrocarbon contamination and as novel inducible
   expression systems with low-cost inducers. Here, we have assembled and
   evolved an alkane-responsive biosensor with a fluorescence output signal
   in Escherichia coli by utilizing regulatory machinery from Pseudomonas
   putida's alkane metabolism. Within our system, the transcriptional
   regulator, AlkSp, is activated by the presence of alkanes and binds to
   the P-alkB promoter, stimulating transcription of a Green Fluorescent
   Protein reporter. Through two successive rounds of directed evolution
   via error prone PCR and fluorescence activated cell sorting, we isolated
   alkS mutants enabling up to a 5 fold increase in fluorescence output
   signal in response to short-chain alkanes such as hexane and pentane.
   Further characterization of selected mutants demonstrated altered
   responsiveness to a wide range of linear alkanes (pentane to dodecane).
   Sequence analysis highlighted the S470T mutation as a likely candidate
   responsible for increased effectiveness of the AlkS protein for
   short-chain alkanes. This work represents the first evolution of a
   synthetic biosensor system for alkanes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The morphology, tensile, impact properties, and thermal expansion
   behavior of polycarbonate (PC)/acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene
   (ABS)/talc composites with different compositions and mixing sequences

   composites, it was observed that some talc particles were located in
   both the PC and the ABS phases of the blend but most were at the
   interface between the PC and ABS phases for every mixing sequence.
   Aspect ratios of the talc particles determined by TEM image analysis
   reasonably matched values computed from tensile modulus using composite
   theory. The thermal expansion behavior, or CTE values, was not
   significantly influenced by the mixing sequence. The impact strength of
   the PC/ABS/talc composites depended significantly on the mixing
   sequence; a premix with PC gave the poorest toughness. The molecular
   weight of the PC in PC/talc composites was found to be significantly
   decreased. It appears that the impact strength of the PC/ABS/talc
   composites is seriously compromised by the degradation of the PC caused
   by talc. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2012}},

Abstract = {{Freezing of fluids in capillary structures affects systems that range
   from soils to the polymer membranes that are used in fuel cells. Neutron
   radiography can be used to image phase change within otherwise opaque
   structures and previous studies have shown the capability of
   quantitative imaging of freezing at similar to 3 mm scale. In this
   study, a 1.6 mm diameter water column within an aluminum rod was imaged
   using neutron radiography and fluid density information was extracted. A
   ray-tracing flux model was developed in order to correct for the effects
   of beam divergence on the acquired images. The model produced image
   intensity maps that fit experimental data with R-2 values of 0.98.
   Density measurements for water and ice within the capillary were found
   to be 1.00 +/- 0.03 and 0.93 +/- 0.03 g/cm(3), respectively, which are
   within 1\% of published density values for both phases. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Subject to forces and voltage, a dielectric elastomer may undergo
   electromechanical phase transition. A phase diagram is constructed for
   an ideal dielectric elastomer membrane under uniaxial force and voltage,
   reminiscent of the phase diagram for liquid-vapour transition of a pure
   substance. We identify a critical point for the electromechanical phase
   transition. Two states of deformation (thick and thin) may coexist
   during the phase transition, with the mismatch in lateral stretch
   accommodated by wrinkling of the membrane in the thin state. The
   processes of electromechanical phase transition under various conditions
   are discussed. A reversible cycle is suggested for electromechanical
   energy conversion using the dielectric elastomer membrane, analogous to
   the classical Carnot cycle for a heat engine. The amount of energy
   conversion, however, is limited by failure of the dielectric elastomer
   owing to electrical breakdown. With a particular combination of material
   properties, the electromechanical energy conversion can be significantly
   extended by taking advantage of the phase transition without electrical
   breakdown.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a recently developed electron diffraction technique called
   diffraction scanning transmission electron microscopy (D-STEM) is
   coupled with precession electron microscopy to obtain quantitative local
   texture information in damascene copper interconnects (1.8 mu m-70 nm in
   width) with a spatial resolution of less than 5 nm. Misorientation and
   trace analysis is performed to investigate the grain boundary
   distribution in these lines. The results reveal strong variations in
   texture and grain boundary distribution of the copper lines upon
   downscaling. Lines of width 1.8 mu m exhibit a strong < 111 > normal
   texture and comprise large micron-size grains. Upon downscaling to 180
   nm, a \{111\} < 110 > bi-axial texture has been observed. In contrast,
   narrower lines of widths 120 and 70 nm reveal sidewall growth of \{111\}
   grains and a dominant < 110 > normal texture. The microstructure in
   these lines comprises clusters of small grains separated by high angle
   boundaries in the vicinity of large grains. The fraction of coherent
   twin boundaries also reduces with decreasing line width.}},

Abstract = {{Angular momentum is highly regulated over the gait cycle and is
   important for maintaining dynamic stability and control of movement.
   However, little is known regarding how angular momentum is regulated on
   irregular surfaces, such as slopes, when the risk of falling is higher.
   This study examined the three-dimensional whole-body angular momentum
   patterns of 30 healthy subjects walking over a range of incline and
   decline angles. The range of angular momentum was either similar or
   reduced on decline surfaces and increased on incline surfaces relative
   to level ground, with the greatest differences occurring in the frontal
   and sagittal planes. These results suggest that angular momentum is more
   tightly controlled during decline walking when the risk of falling is
   greater. In the frontal plane, the range of angular momentum was
   strongly correlated with the peak hip and knee abduction moments in
   early stance. In the transverse plane, the strongest correlation
   occurred with the knee external rotation peak in late stance. In the
   sagittal plane, all external moment peaks were correlated with the range
   of angular momentum. The peak ankle plantarflexion, knee flexion and hip
   extension moments were also strongly correlated with the sagittal-plane
   angular momentum. These results highlight how able-bodied subjects
   control angular momentum differently on sloped surfaces relative to
   level walking and provide a baseline for comparison with pathological
   populations that are more susceptible to falling. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Understanding how humans maintain stability when walking, particularly
   when exposed to perturbations, is key to preventing falls. Here, we
   quantified how imposing continuous, pseudorandom anterior-posterior (AP)
   and mediolateral (ML) oscillations affected the control of dynamic
   walking stability. Twelve subjects completed five 3-minute walking
   trials in the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN)
   system under each of 5 conditions: no perturbation (NOP), AP platform
   (APP) or visual (APV) or ML platform (MLP) or visual (MLV) oscillations.
   We computed AP and ML margins of stability (MOS) for each trial. Mean
   MOSml were consistently slightly larger during all perturbation
   conditions than during NOP (p <= 0.038). Mean MOSap for the APP, MLP and
   MLV oscillations were significantly smaller than during NOP (p <
   0.0005). Variability of both MOSap and MOSml was significantly greater
   during the MLP and MLV oscillations than during NOP (p < 0.0005). We
   also directly quantified how the MOS on any given step affected the MOS
   on the following step using first-return plots. There were significant
   changes in step-to-step MOSml dynamics between experimental conditions
   (p < 0.0005). These changes suggested that subjects may have been trying
   to control foot placement, and consequently stability, during the
   perturbation conditions. Quantifying step-to-step changes in margins of
   dynamic stability may be more useful than mean MOS in assessing how
   individuals control walking stability. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A rovibrational collisional coarse-grain model has been developed to
   reduce a detailed mechanism for the internal energy excitation and

   rovibrational energy levels of the electronic ground state of the
   nitrogen molecule were lumped into a smaller number of bins. The
   reaction rate coefficients of an ab initio database developed at NASA
   Ames Research Center were averaged for each bin based on a uniform
   distribution of the energy levels within the bin. The results were
   obtained by coupling the Master equation for the reduced mechanism with
   a one-dimensional flow solver for conditions expected for reentry into
   Earth's atmosphere at 10 km/s. The coarse-grain collisional model
   developed allow us to describe accurately the internal energy relaxation
   and dissociation processes based on a smaller number of equations, as
   opposed to existing reduced models assuming thermal equilibrium between
   the rotational and translational energy modes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate impact of metabolic
   syndrome (MS) on outcomes of catheter ablation in patients with atrial
   fibrillation (AF) in terms of recurrence and quality of life (QoL).
   Background MS, a proinflammatory state with hypertension, diabetes,
   dyslipidemia, and obesity, is presumed to be a close associate of AF.
   Methods In this prospective study, 1,496 consecutive patients with AF
   undergoing first ablation (29\% with paroxysmal AF, 26\% with persistent
   AF, and 45\% with long-standing persistent AF) were classified into
   those with MS (group 1; n = 485) and those without MS (group 2; n =
   1,011). Patients were followed for recurrence and QoL. The Medical
   Outcomes Study SF-36 Health Survey was used to assess QoL at baseline
   and 12 month after ablation.
   Results After 21 +/- 7 months of follow-up, 189 patients in group 1
   (39\%) and 319 in group 2 (32\%) had arrhythmia recurrence (p = 0.005).
   When stratified by AF type, patients with nonparoxysmal AF in group 1
   failed more frequently compared with those in group 2 (150 {[}46\%] vs.
   257 {[}35\%], p = 0.002); no difference existed in the subgroup with
   paroxysmal AF (39 {[}25\%] vs. 62 {[}22\%], p = 0.295). Group 1 patients
   had significantly lower baseline scores on all SF-36 Health Survey
   subscales. At follow-up, both mental component summary (Delta 5.7 +/-
   2.5, p < 0.001) and physical component summary (Delta 9.1 +/- 3.7, p <
   0.001) scores improved in group 1, whereas only mental component summary
   scores (Delta 4.6 +/- 2.8, p = 0.036) were improved in group 2. In the
   subgroup with nonparoxysmal AF, MS, sex, C-reactive protein >= 0.9
   mg/dl, and white blood cell count were independent predictors of
   recurrence.
   Conclusions Baseline inflammatory markers and the presence of MS
   predicted higher recurrence after single-catheter ablation only in
   patients with nonparoxysmal AF. Additionally, significant improvements
   in QoL were observed in the post-ablation MS population. (J Am Coll

Abstract = {{Background-Observational data suggest that performing radiofrequency
   catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) under therapeutic warfarin
   (continuous warfarin {[}CW]) may reduce the periprocedural risk of
   complications, such as thromboembolic events, compared to warfarin
   discontinuation (DW) with periprocedural bridging with heparin. We
   systematically reviewed the available evidence on the impact of CW
   compared with DW on periprocedural complications of AF catheter
   ablation.
   Methods and Results-We searched major Web databases for studies on
   radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF under CW versus DW with
   periprocedural bridging with heparin. Data on periprocedural
   complications were extracted. We identified 9 studies (1 large case
   series indirectly compared with the latest Worldwide Survey). A total of
   27 402 patients were included in the analysis (6400 undergoing ablation
   with CW). CW was associated with a striking decrease of thromboembolic
   complications (OR, 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.05-0.23; P<0.001) and minor bleeding
   complications (OR, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.21-0.71; P=0.002) compared with DW.
   CW also did not increase the risk of major bleeding (OR, 0.67; 95\% CI,
   0.31-1.43; P=0.30), including cardiac tamponade (OR, 0.69; 95\% CI,
   0.19-2.47; P=0.57).
   Conclusions-There is highly consistent evidence from observational
   studies that a CW strategy during radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF
   reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications without increasing the
   risk of bleeding. (Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol. 2012;5:302-311.)}},

Abstract = {{A homogeneous one-dimensional optical lattice is demonstrated by using a
   high-precision beam shaper based on a digital micromirror device (DMD)
   with an imaging system containing a pinhole low-pass filter (LPF). This
   system is capable of producing a high-quality flattop beam profile to
   form a standing-wave optical lattice with a 50 x 50 mu m(2) flattop
   region. The periodic potential generated by the optical lattice confines
   ultracold atoms in Bose-Einstein condensate experiments. We conducted
   beam shaping tests at several wavelengths by implementing various
   coherent and incoherent light sources in the visible and infrared
   wavelength ranges. Experiments produced flattop and other
   well-controlled beam profiles with 0.2\% to 0.26\% root-mean-square
   (RMS) error after applying a digital LPF and nearly flat phase. Several
   concerns for the system design are presented. First, the energy
   requirement was determined by power conversion analysis and DMD
   diffraction efficiency simulation. In addition, a LabVIEW program was
   written to accelerate the speed of the iterative process for beam
   profile refinement. Finally, various camera calibrations improved the
   measurement accuracy. We achieved a 1.25\% RMS error flattop beam with
   diameter of 70.4 mu m at the atoms' plane. Other beam profile
   measurements in different diagnostic planes demonstrated a good
   intensity uniformity of the optical lattice. (C) 2012 Society of

   transport in p-type films of copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2)

Abstract = {{Ferrofluids have promising application potentials for biological,
   medical, subsurface, and many other industrial purposes. To bring the
   potentials to reality, it is of utmost importance to characterize the
   behavior of ferrofluids under different conditions, especially in the
   presence of more than one phase. In this study, the quasi-static
   behavior of a non-wetting incompressible and inviscid ferrofluid blob
   surrounded by a wetting non-magnetic fluid confined in a capillary tube
   is theoretically and computationally investigated when a uniform
   magnetic field is applied, assuming isothermal conditions. The effect of
   geometrical, hydrodynamic, and magnetic properties of the blob on its
   deformations when subject to a magnetic field is explained. Moreover,
   the effect of nonlinear magnetization on the ferrofluid blob evolution
   in the capillary tube is investigated in detail. In the case of a tube
   with constant circular cross-section, the behavior of the blob before
   the critical state of detachment is determined numerically, while the
   post-critical behavior is resolved analytically. To characterize the
   pre-critical blob deformations, the magnetic field distribution inside
   the blob for given external magnetic fields is calculated using a
   commercial finite element software and is employed to calculate the
   interfacial configuration from balances among magnetic, capillary, and
   hydrostatic forces. We show that increasing magnetic field intensity
   above a critical value causes the blob to detach from the tube wall
   under certain conditions and quantitatively characterize the critical
   magnetic field as well as blob configurations before and after
   detachment. Results show that there is a maximum blob length beyond
   which detachment does not occur, due to the nonlinear magnetization of
   the ferrofluid blob. This length depends on the relative magnitude of
   magnetic and capillary forces and also on the geometry of the confining
   capillary tube. Even if detachment occurs, the nonlinear magnetization
   prevents the blob from evolving infinitely after detachment. The
   conditions under which detachment may occur are analytically determined.
   The simulations confirm that, for sufficiently small magnetic fields,
   the linear approximate magnetization yields satisfactory results.
   However, with increasing magnetic field intensity, the deviation between
   the results with nonlinear magnetization and those with linear
   approximate magnetization increases significantly. In addition, this
   deviation is more pronounced for longer blobs. These findings emphasize
   the importance of incorporating the nonlinear magnetization for
   relatively large magnetic field intensities. Finally, in order to relax
   the simple confining geometry assumption, we show preliminary
   simulations using the level set method in complex solid geometries. The
   method was previously developed for capillarity and used for realistic
   rock geometries and now accounts for the magnetic pressures as well. (C)

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The computations of the high-order partial derivatives in a given
   problem are often cumbersome or not accurate. To combat such
   shortcomings, a new method for calculating exact high-order
   sensitivities using multicomplex numbers is presented. Inspired by the
   recent complex step method that is only valid for first-order
   sensitivities, the new multicomplex approach is valid to arbitrary
   order. The mathematical theory behind this approach is revealed, and an
   efficient procedure for the automatic implementation of the method is
   described. Several applications are presented to validate and
   demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results
   are compared to conventional approaches such as finite differencing, the
   complex step method, and two separate automatic differentiation tools.
   The multicomplex method performs favorably in the preliminary
   comparisons and is therefore expected to be useful for a variety of
   algorithms that exploit higher order derivatives.}},

Abstract = {{Cores in chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) share multiple memory subsystem
   resources. If resource sharing is unfair, some applications can be
   delayed significantly while others are unfairly prioritized. Previous
   research proposed separate fairness mechanisms for each resource. Such
   resource-based fairness mechanisms implemented independently in each
   resource can make contradictory decisions, leading to low fairness and
   performance loss. Therefore, a coordinated mechanism that provides
   fairness in the entire shared memory system is desirable.
   This article proposes a new approach that provides fairness in the
   entire shared memory system, thereby eliminating the need for and
   complexity of developing fairness mechanisms for each resource. Our
   technique, Fairness via Source Throttling (FST), estimates unfairness in
   the entire memory system. If unfairness is above a system-software-set
   threshold, FST throttles down cores causing unfairness by limiting the
   number of requests they create and the frequency at which they do. As
   such, our source-based fairness control ensures fairness decisions are
   made in tandem in the entire memory system. FST enforces thread
   priorities/weights, and enables system-software to enforce different
   fairness objectives in the memory system.
   Our evaluations show that FST provides the best system fairness and
   performance compared to three systems with state-of-the-art fairness
   mechanisms implemented in both shared caches and memory controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Field-effect transistors fabricated on graphene grown by chemical vapor
   deposition (CVD) often exhibit large hysteresis accompanied by low
   mobility, high positive backgate voltage corresponding to the minimum
   conductivity point (V-min), and high intrinsic canter concentration
   (eta(0)). In this report, we show that the mobility reported to date for
   CVD graphene devices on SiO2 is limited by trapped water between the
   graphene and SiO2 substrate, impurities introduced during the transfer
   process and adsorbates acquired from the ambient. We systematically
   study the origin of the scattering impurities and report on a process
   which achieves the highest mobility (mu) reported to date on large-area
   devices for CVD graphene on SiO2: maximum mobility (mu(max)) of 7800
   cm(2)/(V center dot s) measured at room temperature and 12 700 cm(2)/(V
   center dot s) at 77 K. These mobility values are dose to those reported
   for exfoliated graphene on SiO2 and can be obtained through the careful
   control of device fabrication steps Including minimizing resist residue
   and non-aqueous transfer combined with annealing. it is also observed
   that CVD graphene is prone to adsorption of atmospheric species, and
   annealing at elevated temperature in vacuum helps remove these species.}},

Abstract = {{Block copolymers demonstrate potential for use in next-generation
   lithography due to their ability to self-assemble into well-ordered
   periodic arrays on the 3-100 nm length scale. The successful
   lithographic application of block copolymers relies on three critical
   conditions being met: high Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (chi),
   which enable formation of <10 nm features, etch selectivity between
   blocks for facile pattern transfer, and thin film self-assembly control.
   The present paper describes the synthesis and self-assembly of block
   copolymers composed of naturally derived oligosaccharides coupled to a
   silicon-containing polystyrene derivative synthesized by activators
   regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization.
   The block copolymers have a large chi and a low degree of polymerization
   (N) enabling formation of 5 nm feature diameters, incorporate silicon in
   one block for oxygen reactive ion etch contrast, and exhibit bulk and
   thin film self-assembly of hexagonally packed cylinders facilitated by a
   combination of spin coating and solvent annealing techniques. As
   observed by small angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy,
   these materials exhibit some of the smallest block copolymer features in
   the bulk and in thin films reported to date.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with wavy microstructures span disciplinary boundaries, yet
   relatively little systematic work has been done to characterize their
   thermo-mechanical response. Motivated by recent work on the
   elastic-plastic response of wavy periodic multilayers, and the
   discovered layer thickness effect in the post-yield domain, we extend
   our finite-volume based homogenization theory in order to investigate
   the effect of microstructural refinement, as well as geometric and
   material parameters, in this class of periodic materials in the
   finite-deformation domain. Micromechanical analysis of a model wavy
   multilayered system which mimics certain biological tissues quantifies
   the importance of layer thickness, and hence the microstructural bending
   stiffness, on the stiffening stress-stretch response. The role of the
   matrix phase in the unfolding process is also highlighted. The results
   provide insight into the design of materials intended to mimic the
   response of a certain class of biological tissues with stiffening
   characteristics such as chordae tendineae. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{We consider a robust-optimization-driven system-level approach to
   interference management in a cellular broadband system operating in an
   interference-limited and highly dynamic regime. Here, base stations in
   neighboring cells (partially) coordinate their transmission schedules in
   an attempt to avoid simultaneous max-power transmission to their mutual
   cell edge. Limits on communication overhead and use of the backhaul
   require base station coordination to occur at a slower timescale than
   the customer arrival process. The central challenge is to properly
   structure coordination decisions at the slow timescale, as these
   subsequently restrict the actions of each base station until the next
   coordination period. Moreover, because coordination occurs at the slower
   timescale, the statistics of the arriving customers, e. g., the load,
   are typically only approximately known-thus, this coordination must be
   done with only approximate knowledge of statistics. We show that
   performance of existing approaches that assume exact knowledge of these
   statistics can degrade rapidly as the uncertainty in the arrival process
   increases. We show that a two-stage robust optimization framework is a
   natural way to model two-timescale decision problems. We provide
   tractable formulations for the base-station coordination problem and
   show that our formulation is robust to fluctuations (uncertainties) in
   the arriving load. This tolerance to load fluctuation also serves to
   reduce the need for frequent reoptimization across base stations, thus
   helping minimize the communication overhead required for system-level
   interference reduction. Our robust optimization formulations are
   flexible, allowing us to control the conservatism of the solution. Our
   simulations show that we can build in robustness without significant
   degradation of nominal performance.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing worldwide competition, high technology manufacturing
   companies have to take great care to lower their production costs and
   guarantee high quality at the same time. Advanced process control (APC)
   is widely used in semiconductor manufacturing to adjust machine
   parameters so as to achieve satisfactory product quality. When there is
   a conflict between quality and scheduling objectives, quality usually
   takes precedence. This paper studies the interaction between scheduling
   and APC. A single-machine multiple-job-types makespan problem with APC
   constraints is proved to be NP-hard. For some special cases, optimal
   solutions are obtained analytically. In more general cases, the
   structure of optimal solutions is explored. An efficient heuristic
   algorithm based on these structural results is proposed and compared to
   an integer programming approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, we focused on the use of polarizable force fields
   to model the structural, energetic, and thermodynamical properties of
   lanthanides and actinides in water. In a first part, we chose the
   particular case of the Th(IV) cation to demonstrate the capabilities of
   the AMOEBA polarizable force field to reproduce both reference ab initio
   gas-phase energetics and experimental data including coordination
   numbers and radial distribution functions. Using such model, we
   predicted the first polarizable force field estimate of Th(IV) solvation
   free energy, which accounts for -1,638 kcal/mol. In addition, we
   proposed in a second part of this work a full extension of the SIBFA
   (Sum of Interaction Between Fragments Ab initio computed) polarizable
   potential to lanthanides (La(III) and Lu(III)) and to actinides (Th(IV))
   in water. We demonstrate its capabilities to reproduce all ab initio
   contributions as extracted from energy decomposition analysis
   computations, including many-body charge transfer and discussed its
   applicability to extended molecular dynamics and its parametrization on
   high-level post-Hartree-Fock data.}},

Title = {{MISO Broadcast Channels with Delayed Finite-Rate Feedback: Predict or

Abstract = {{Most multiuser precoding techniques require accurate channel state
   information at the transmitter (CSIT) to maintain orthogonality between
   the users. Such techniques have proven quite fragile in time-varying
   channels because the CSIT is inherently imperfect due to quantization
   error and feedback delay. An alternative approach recently proposed by
   Maddah-Ali and Tse (MAT) allows for significant multiplexing gain in the
   multi-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) even with CSIT
   that is ``completely stale{''}, i.e., uncorrelated with the current
   channel state. With K users, their scheme claims to lose only a log(K)
   factor relative to the full K degrees of freedom (DoF) attainable in the
   MISO BC with perfect CSIT for large K. However, their result does not
   consider the cost of the feedback, which is potentially very large in
   high mobility (short channel coherence time). In this paper, we more
   closely examine the MAT scheme and compare its maximum net DoF gain to
   single user transmission (which always achieves 1 DoF) and partial CSIT
   linear precoding (which achieves up to K). In particular, assuming the
   channel coherence time is N symbol periods and the feedback delay is
   N-fd, we show that when N < (1 + o(1)) K log K (short coherence time),
   single user transmission performs best, whereas for N > (1 + o(1))(N-fd
   + K/log K)(1-log(-1) K)(-1) (long coherence time), zero-forcing
   precoding outperforms the other two. The MAT scheme is optimal for
   intermediate coherence times, which for practical parameter choices is
   indeed quite a large and significant range, even accounting for the
   feedback cost.}},

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have reported intriguing trends for the molecular
   weight (MW) dependence of the conductivity of block copolymer lamellae
   that contrast with the behavior of homopolymer matrices. By using
   coarse-grained simulations of the sorption and transport of penetrant
   cations, we probe the possible mechanisms underlying such behavior. Our
   results indicate that the MW dependence of conductivity of homopolymeric
   and block copolymeric matrices arise from different mechanisms. On the
   one hand, the solvation energies of cations, and, in turn, the charge
   carrier concentrations, themselves, exhibit a MW dependence in block
   copolymer matrices. Such trends are shown to arise from variations in
   the thickness of the conducting phase relative to that of the
   interfacial zones. Moreover, distinct mechanisms are shown to be
   responsible for the diffusivities of ions in homopolymer and block
   copolymer matrices. In the former, diffusivity effects associated with
   the free ends of the polymers play an important role. In contrast, in
   block copolymer lamellae, the interfacial zone between the blocks
   presents a zone of hindered diffusivity for ions and manifests as a
   molecular weight dependence of the ionic diffusivity. Together, the
   preceding mechanisms are shown to provide a plausible explanation for
   the experimentally observed trends for the conductivity of block
   copolymer matrices.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of the split-CV mobility extraction method is analyzed in
   buried-channel InGaAs MOSFETs with a Al2O3 gate dielectric and an InP
   barrier, through a ``simulated experiment{''} procedure using 2-D
   numerical device simulations that are preliminarily calibrated against
   experimental I-V and CV curves. The different error sources limiting the
   method accuracy are pointed out. It is suggested that, as a result of
   these errors, the split-CV method can appreciably underestimate the
   actual channel mobility in these devices, with an error of > 20\% and >
   50\% on peak mobility and high-VGS mobility, respectively. The method
   should therefore not be adopted for accurate mobility measurement in
   this operating regime but only as a fast response technique providing a
   conservative estimation of channel mobility. Moreover, the method
   provides mobility values that rapidly drop below the peak value for
   decreasing VGS. It is shown that this behavior can be an artifact of the
   extraction method, which may mask physical mechanisms causing a real
   mobility drop with decreasing channel carrier density, such as Coulomb
   scattering mechanisms. This poses limitations to the adoption of
   split-CV mobility as a reference for mobility model assessment in this
   operating regime. The proposed methodology can be applied to other III-V
   FETs, including both heterostructure-based and inversion-mode devices.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-D extension of the adaptive integral method (AIM) is presented for
   fast analysis of scattering from electrically large perfect electrically
   conducting structures embedded inside a single layer of a planar layered
   medium. The proposed scheme accelerates the iterative method-of-moments
   (MOM) solution of the combined-field integral equation by employing a
   3-D auxiliary regular grid. It uses the auxiliary grid to execute the
   standard four-stage AIM procedure; unlike the procedure for free space,
   two different sets of matrices are obtained for the AIM propagation
   stage by decomposing the Green functions to terms that are in
   convolution or correlation form in the stratification direction. These
   matrices are in (three level) block-Toeplitz and Hankel-(two
   level)-block-Toeplitz forms and can be multiplied by using 3-D FFTs. The
   dominant computational costs of the scheme are the evaluation of O(N)
   different layered-medium Green functions, which is accelerated by
   extracting asymptotic terms and using interpolation tables, and the
   matrix multiplications in the propagation stage, which require only
   O(N-C log N-C) per iteration; these should be contrasted to the O(N-2)
   Green function evaluations and O(N-2) operations per iteration required
   by the classical MOM. Here, N-C denotes the number of nodes on the
   auxiliary grid, and N denotes the number of degrees of freedom of the
   surface current density. Numerical results validate the proposed
   method's complexity, demonstrate its accuracy for several large-scale
   structures in layered media, and compare its computational costs to
   those of its counterpart for free space.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation detectors installed at key interdiction points provide defense
   against nuclear smuggling attempts by scanning vehicles and traffic for
   illicit nuclear material. These hypothetical threat scenarios may be
   modeled using radiation transport simulations. However, high-fidelity
   models are computationally intensive. Furthermore, the range of smuggler
   attributes and detector technologies create a large problem space not
   easily overcome by brute-force methods. Previous research has
   demonstrated that decomposing the scenario into independently simulated
   components using Green's functions can simulate photon detector signals
   with coarse energy resolution. This paper extends this methodology by
   presenting physics enhancements and numerical treatments which allow for
   an arbitrary level of energy resolution for photon transport. As a
   result, spectroscopic detector signals produced from full forward
   transport simulations can be replicated while requiring multiple orders

Abstract = {{Network-on-Chips (NoCs) have been proposed as a solution for addressing
   the global communication challenges in System-on-Chip (SoC)
   architectures that are implemented in nanoscale technologies. For the
   use of NoCs to be feasible in today's industrial designs, a
   custom-tailored, power- efficient NoC topology that satisfies the
   application characteristics is required. In this work, we present a
   design methodology that automates the synthesis of such
   application-specific NoC topologies. We present a method which
   integrates partitioning into floorplanning phase to explore optimal
   clustering of cores during floorplanning with minimized link and switch
   power consumption. Based on the size of applications, we also present an
   Integer Linear Programming and a heuristic method to place switches and
   network interfaces on the floorplan. Then, a power and timing aware path
   allocation algorithm is carried out to determine the connectivity across
   different switches. We perform experiments on several SoC benchmarks and
   present a comparison with the latest work. For small applications, the
   NoC topologies synthesized by our method show large improvements in
   power consumption (27,54\%), hop-count (4\%) and running time (66\%) on

Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study flow through vegetated wetlands using high
   resolution computational models to describe the flow. The goal is to
   describe drag characteristics of this flow at the large scales as a
   function of Reynolds number. This work is of importance to scientists
   and engineers dealing with wetland health and restoration, inland
   flooding due to tropical storms and hurricanes, and river lining
   projects. The existence of vegetation affects the flow resistance, which
   is a major factor in determining velocity and water level distribution
   in wetlands.
   For low Reynolds numbers, wetlands behave similarly to porous media,
   where it is well-known that Stokes flow at the micro-scale can be
   upscaled through homogenization to Darcy's Law at the macro-scale. As
   Reynolds number increases moderately, small-scale drag effects can be
   captured by adding a quadratic and/or cubic term to the Darcy equation;
   the so-called Darcy-Forchheimer model. For higher Reynolds numbers,
   Stokes equation is no longer a valid approximation, and full
   Navier-Stokes models must be used. We utilize large eddy simulation
   (LES) to study vegetative drag at high Reynolds numbers. The numerical
   simulations in this paper are performed using the Proteus Toolkit, which
   is under development by Kees and Farthing at ERDC. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   the origin for most initial conditions while simultaneously enforcing
   orthogonality on the matrix estimate for all time. In addition to

Abstract = {{Blood flow in murine epicardial and intra-myocardial coronary arteries
   was measured in vivo with spectral domain optical Doppler tomography
   (SD-ODT). Videos at frame rates up to 180 fps were collected and
   processed to extract phase shifts associated with moving erythrocytes in
   the coronary arteries. Radial averaging centered on the vessel lumen
   provided spatial smoothing of phase noise in a single cross-sectional
   frame for instantaneous peak velocity measurement without distortion of
   the flow profile. Temporal averaging synchronized to the cardiac cycle
   (i.e., gating) was also performed to reduce phase noise, although
   resulting in lower flow profiles. The vessel angle with respect to
   incident imaging beam was measured with three-dimensional raster scans
   collected from the same region as the high speed cross-sectional scans.
   The variability in peak phase measurement was 10-15\% from cycle to
   cycle on a single animal but larger for measurements among animals. The
   inter-subject variability is attributed to factors related to real
   physiological and anatomical differences, instrumentation variables, and
   measurement error. The measured peak instantaneous flow velocity in a
   similar to 40-mu m diameter vessel was 23.5 mm/s (28 kHz Doppler phase
   shift). In addition to measurement of the flow velocity, we observed
   several dynamic features of the vessel and surrounding myocardium in the
   intensity and phase sequences, including asymmetric vessel deformation
   and rapid flow reversal immediately following maximum flow, in
   confirmation of known coronary artery flow dynamics. SD-ODT is an
   optical imaging tool that can provide in vivo measures of structural and
   functional information on cardiac function in small animals. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Reconvergent paths in circuits have been a nuisance in various
   computer-aided design (CAD) algorithms, but no elegant solution to deal
   with them has been found yet. In statistical static timing analysis
   (SSTA), they cause difficulty in capturing topological correlation. This
   paper presents a technique that in arbitrary block-based SSTA reduces
   the error caused by ignoring topological correlation. We interpret a
   timing graph as an algebraic expression made up of addition and maximum
   operators. We define the division operation on the expression and
   propose algorithms that modify factors in the expression without
   expansion. As a result, the algorithms produce an expression to derive
   the latest arrival time with better accuracy in SSTA. Existing
   techniques handling reconvergent fanouts usually use dependency lists,
   requiring quadratic space complexity. Instead, the proposed technique
   has linear space complexity by using a new directed acyclic graph search
   algorithm. Our results show that it outperforms an existing technique in
   speed and memory usage with comparable accuracy. More important, the
   proposed technique is not limited to SSTA and is potentially applicable
   to various issues due to reconvergent paths in timing-related CAD
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to compute criticality probabilities of
   paths in parameterized statistical static timing analysis. We partition
   the set of all the paths into several groups and formulate the path
   criticality into a joint probability of inequalities. Before evaluating
   the joint probability directly, we simplify the inequalities through
   algebraic elimination, handling topological correlation. Our proposed
   method uses conditional probabilities to obtain the joint probability,
   and statistics of random variables representing process parameters are
   changed to take into account the conditions. To calculate the
   conditional statistics of the random variables, we derive analytic
   formulas by extending Clark's work. This allows us to obtain the
   conditional probability density function of a path delay, given the path
   is critical, as well as to compute criticality probabilities of paths.
   Our experimental results show that the proposed method provides 4.2X
   better accuracy on average in comparison to the state-of-art method.}},

Abstract = {{A video display device having a lower number of bits per pixel than that
   required by the video to be displayed quantizes the video prior to its
   display. Halftoning can perform this quantization while attempting to
   reduce the visibility of certain quantization artifacts. Quantization
   artifacts are, nevertheless, not eliminated. A temporal artifact known
   as dirty-window effect (DWE) can be commonly observed in medium
   frame-rate binary video halftones. In this paper, we propose video
   halftone enhancement algorithms to reduce DWE. We assess the performance
   of the proposed algorithms by presenting objective measures for DWE in
   the original and the improved halftone videos. The expected
   contributions of this paper include three medium frame-rate binary video
   halftone enhancement algorithms that do the following: 1) reduce DWE
   under a spatial quality constraint; 2) reduce DWE under a spatial
   quality constraint with reduced complexity; and 3) reduce DWE under
   spatial and temporal quality constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Restricted visualization of the surgical field is one of the most
   critical challenges for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Current
   intraoperative visualization systems are promising. However, they can
   hardly meet the requirements of high resolution and real time 3D
   visualization of the surgical scene to support the recognition of
   anatomic structures for safe MIS procedures. In this paper, we present a
   new approach for real time 3D visualization of organ deformations based
   on optical imaging patches with limited field-of-view and a single
   preoperative scan of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed
   tomography (CT). The idea for reconstruction is motivated by our
   empirical observation that the spherical harmonic coefficients
   corresponding to distorted surfaces of a given organ lie in lower
   dimensional subspaces in a structured dictionary that can be learned
   from a set of representative training surfaces. We provide both
   theoretical and practical designs for achieving these goals.
   Specifically, we discuss details about the selection of limited optical
   views and the registration of partial optical images with a single
   preoperative MRI/CT scan. The design proposed in this paper is evaluated
   with both finite element modeling data and ex vivo experiments. The ex
   vivo test is conducted on fresh porcine kidneys using 3D MRI scans with
   1.2 mm resolution and a portable laser scanner with an accuracy of 0.13
   mm. Results show that the proposed method achieves a sub-3 mm spatial
   resolution in terms of Hausdorff distance when using only one
   preoperative MRI scan and the optical patch from the single-sided view
   of the kidney. The reconstruction frame rate is between 10 frames/s and
   39 frames/s depending on the complexity of the test model.}},

Abstract = {{As the second most abundant cation in the human body, zinc is vital for
   the structures and functions of many proteins. Zinc-containing matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been widely investigated as potential
   drug targets in a range of diseases ranging from cardiovascular
   disorders to cancers. However, it remains a challenge in theoretical
   studies to treat zinc in proteins with classical mechanics. In this
   study, we examined Zn2+ coordination with organic compounds and protein
   side chains using a polarizable atomic multipole-based electrostatic
   model. We find that the polarization effect plays a determining role in
   Zn2+ coordination geometry in both matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
   complexes and zinc-finger proteins. In addition, the relative binding
   free energies of selected inhibitors binding with MMP13 have been
   estimated and compared with experimental results. While not directly
   interacting with the small molecule inhibitors, the permanent and
   polarizing field of Zn2+ exerts a strong influence on the relative
   affinities of the ligands. The simulation results also reveal that the
   polarization effect on binding is ligand-dependent and thus difficult to
   incorporate into fixed-charge models implicitly.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Key processing steps in the thin-film process of manufacturing catalyst
   layers for direct methanol fuel cells are catalyst ink formulation and
   its application. The catalyst ink is typically composed of supported or
   unsupported catalysts, binder (ionomer), solvents, and additives.
   Rheological properties of the ink, amount of binder, and choice of
   solvents are tuned to match the particular ink application process used
   to fabricate the electrode, as each coating process has its own unique
   requirements. Besides affecting the coating process, the choice and
   ratios of these components can significantly affect the electrochemical
   performance of the electrode. In this study, catalyst inks are designed
   and investigated for the spraying process, for utilization in the
   continuous fabrication of DMFC electrodes. For this purpose, the effect
   of the binder (ionomer) content on the performance of the electrodes is
   studied in detail. Decal-transfer electrodes are fabricated on a
   custom-built automated spraying apparatus with individually specified
   anode and cathode binder contents, and assembled to form a catalyst
   coated membrane (CCM) type membrane electrode assembly (MEA). These
   electrodes are rigorously tested to specifically identify their
   electrochemical performance, catalyst utilization and electrode

   Because only normal forces are used for mechanical interfacing, the two
   chips are not permanently connected, allowing exchange of the test
   coupon chips. The actuated test platform chip contains a thermal
   actuator driving a compliant displacement amplification transmission,
   and a bulk-micromachined well in which the test coupon chips may be
   placed and removed. The displacement amplification structure provides 40
   mu m of output displacement, extending a probe over the well and into
   contact with the test coupon. The test coupon contains compliant
   structures that are actuated by the probe from the test platform.

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives Mechanical indentation has been shown to
   increase light transmission through turbid tissue. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of localized indentation on the optical
   properties of ex vivo porcine skin specimens by dynamically monitoring
   diffuse reflectance spectra, light transmission, and applied load while
   controlling tissue thickness.
   Study Design/Methods: A custom-built diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
   (DRS) system was used to capture diffuse reflectance spectra from tissue
   specimens undergoing indentation. The DRS probe was designed to perform
   both optical sensing and tissue indentation. A mechanical load frame was
   used to dynamically control probe displacement and resultant specimen
   thickness change while recording applied load. Diffuse reflectance
   spectra, as well as light transmission at 630 nm, were recorded during
   stress relaxation tests where tissue specimens were displaced to and
   held at a final thickness. Tissue optical properties were extracted from
   reflectance spectra using a previously established look-up table (LUT)
   approach.
   Results: Indentation increased light transmission through tissue during
   linear displacement, and continued to increase transmission during
   subsequent stress relaxation at constant tissue thickness. The magnitude
   of relative transmission increases was shown to be a function of bulk
   tissue compressive strain (relative thickness change). Reduced
   scattering coefficients calculated from the LUT at 630 nm decreased
   during stress relaxation, with the relative decrease in scattering also
   depending strongly on tissue compressive strain. Reduced scattering
   coefficients decreased by 12.0 +/- 4.7\% at 0.44 +/- 0.022 compressive
   strain, and reduced by 35.6 +/- 1.3\% at 0.71 +/- 0.01 compressive
   strain.
   Conclusion: DRS can be used to capture transient changes in intrinsic
   tissue optical properties during mechanical loading. Mechanical
   indentation modifies tissue optical properties and may be harnessed as a
   minimally-invasive optical clearing technique to improve optical
   diagnostics and therapeutics. Lasers Surg. Med. 44: 303-309, 2012. (C)

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Background Nanoparticles have recently gained interest as exogenous
   contrast agents in a variety of biomedical applications related to
   cancer detection and treatment. The objective of this study was to
   determine the potential of topically administered antibody conjugated
   gold nanorods (GNRs) for imaging squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the
   skin using near-infrared narrowband imaging (NBI). Near-infrared (NIR)
   NBI images narrow wavelength bands to enhance contrast from plasmonic
   particles in a wide field portable and noncontact device that is
   clinically compatible for real-time tumor imaging and tumor margin
   demarcation.
   Study design: We conjugated GNRs to Cetuximab, a clinically approved
   humanized antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR), which is over-expressed on the surface of many tumor cells,
   especially SCCs. We excised subcutaneous xenografts of SCCs (A431) from
   Swiss nu/nu mice and divided the tumors into two groups: (1) the
   targeted group (Cetuximab conjugated GNRs) and (2) the control group
   (polyethylene glycol-conjugated GNRs). After topical application of
   particles and incubation for 30 minutes, the tumors were washed and
   imaged using NBI. In addition, we performed two-photon imaging to
   quantify the binding of EGFR targeted GNRs in tumors and their depth
   profile.
   Results: The NBI images showed a visual increase in contrast from tumors
   after topical administration of targeted GNR. Targeted GNR tumors showed
   increased contrast compared to tumors administered with the control GNR.
   There was a statistically significant increase in mean pixel intensity
   (similar to 2.5x) from targeted GNR tumors (n = 6). Two-photon
   microscopy images of targeted GNRs confirmed their binding affinity to
   the EGF receptors over expressed in the A431 tumors.
   Conclusion: We have demonstrated that a topical application of gold
   nanorods targeted specifically to tumor growth factor receptors results
   in a significantly higher image contrast compared to nontargeted gold
   nanorods. These results demonstrate the feasibility of near-infrared NBI
   to image and demarcate tumor margins during surgical resection using
   topical administration of targeted GNR. Lasers Surg. Med. 44: 310-317,

Abstract = {{We present a novel method to prepare highly conductive, free-standing,
   and flexible porous carbon thin films by chemical activation of reduced
   graphene oxide paper. These flexible carbon thin films possess a very
   high specific surface area of 2400 m(2) g(-1) with a high in-plane
   electrical conductivity of 5880 S m(-1). This is the highest specific
   surface area for a free-standing carbon film reported to date. A
   two-electrode supercapacitor using these carbon films as electrodes
   demonstrated an excellent high-frequency response, an extremely low
   equivalent series resistance on the order of 0.1 ohm, and a high-power
   delivery of about 500 kW kg(-1). While higher frequency and power values
   for graphene materials have been reported, these are the highest values
   achieved while simultaneously maintaining excellent specific
   capacitances and energy densities of 120 F g(-1) and 26 W h kg(-1),
   respectively. In addition, these free-standing thin films provide a
   route to simplify the electrode-manufacturing process by eliminating
   conducting additives and binders. The synthetic process is also
   compatible with existing industrial level KOH activation processes and
   roll-to-roll thin-film fabrication technologies.}},

   spherical shell stiffened with a foot ring and is approached (1) by
   using the axisymmetric formulation of linear elasticity theory and (2)
   by using a dimensionally reduced shell-ring model. In the first approach
   the problem is solved with a fully automatic hp-adaptive finite element
   solver whereas the classical h-version of the finite element method is
   used in the second approach. We study the convergence behaviour of the
   different numerical models and show that accurate stress resultants can
   be obtained with both models by using effective post-processing

Abstract = {{Femtocells, despite their name, pose a potentially large disruption to
   the carefully planned cellular networks that now connect a majority of
   the planet's citizens to the Internet and with each other. Femtocells -
   which by the end of 2010 already outnumbered traditional base stations
   and at the time of publication are being deployed at a rate of about
   five million a year - both enhance and interfere with this network in
   ways that are not yet well understood. Will femtocells be crucial for
   offloading data and video from the creaking traditional network? Or will
   femtocells prove more trouble than they are worth, undermining decades
   of careful base station deployment with unpredictable interference while
   delivering only limited gains? Or possibly neither: are femtocells just
   a ``flash in the pan{''}; an exciting but short-lived stage of network
   evolution that will be rendered obsolete by improved WiFi offloading,
   new backhaul regulations and/or pricing, or other unforeseen
   technological developments? This tutorial article overviews the history
   of femtocells, demystifies their key aspects, and provides a preview of
   the next few years, which the authors believe will see a rapid
   acceleration towards small cell technology. In the course of the
   article, we also position and introduce the articles that headline this

Abstract = {{Cellular networks are in a major transition from a carefully planned set
   of large tower-mounted base-stations (BSs) to an irregular deployment of
   heterogeneous infrastructure elements that often additionally includes
   micro, pico, and femtocells, as well as distributed antennas. In this
   paper, we develop a tractable, flexible, and accurate model for a
   downlink heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) consisting of K tiers of
   randomly located BSs, where each tier may differ in terms of average
   transmit power, supported data rate and BS density. Assuming a mobile
   user connects to the strongest candidate BS, the resulting
   Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) is greater than 1 when in
   coverage, Rayleigh fading, we derive an expression for the probability
   of coverage (equivalently outage) over the entire network under both
   open and closed access, which assumes a strikingly simple closed-form in
   the high SINR regime and is accurate down to -4 dB even under weaker
   assumptions. For external validation, we compare against an actual LTE
   network (for tier 1) with the other K - 1 tiers being modeled as
   independent Poisson Point Processes. In this case as well, our model is
   accurate to within 1-2 dB. We also derive the average rate achieved by a
   randomly located mobile and the average load on each tier of BSs. One
   interesting observation for interference-limited open access networks is
   that at a given SINR, adding more tiers and/or BSs neither increases nor
   decreases the probability of coverage or outage when all the tiers have
   the same target-SINR.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative, objective measurements of breast curvature computed from
   clinical photographs could be used to investigate factors that impact
   reconstruction and facilitate surgical planning. This paper introduces a
   novel quantitative measure of breast curvature based on catenary. A
   catenary curve is used to approximate the overall curvature of the
   breast contour, and the curvature measure is extracted from the catenary
   curve. The catenary curve was verified by comparing its length, the area
   enclosed by the curve, and the curvature measure from the catenary curve
   to those from manual tracings of the breast contour. The evaluation of
   the proposed analysis employed untreated and postoperative clinical
   photographs of women who were undergoing tissue expander/implant
   (TE/Implant) reconstruction. Logistic regression models were developed
   to distinguish between the curvature of breasts undergoing TE/Implant
   reconstruction and that of untreated breasts based on the curvature
   measure and patient variables (age and body mass index). The
   relationships between the curvature measures of untreated breasts and
   patient variables were also investigated. The catenary curve
   approximates breast curvature reliably. The curvature measure contains
   useful information for quantifying the curvature differences between
   breasts undergoing TE/Implant reconstruction and untreated breasts, and
   identifying the effect of patient variables on the breast shape.}},

Abstract = {{This experimental study focuses on the effect of two important factors
   on the heat transfer and flow properties of copper oxide (CuO)/water
   nanofluids in a parallel microchannel flow configuration. The first
   factor considered is the solid media (CuO) concentration. In this
   investigation, concentration values of 0.005\%, 0.01\%, and 0.1\% by
   volume were tested. The second factor is the use of a surfactant,
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), as a suspension enhancer. All
   together, these two factors led to a total of six types of nanofluids,
   which were tested in addition to pure water, the reference fluid. The
   experimental setup allowed for the determination of the hydrodynamic and
   thermal performance of each nanofluid. In addition, a selection of the
   nanofluids were characterized by the use of scanning transmission
   electron microscopy (STEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
   techniques. The DLS transient settling measurements showed that for a
   nanofluid with a concentration of 0.1\% by volume, the nanoparticle
   dispersion and suspension is negatively affected unless a surfactant is
   used. Hydrodynamic losses, which were evaluated by comparing the effect
   of the imposed pressure drop on the mass flow rate, were not
   meaningfully affected by the composition of the nanofluids tested. The
   measurements also showed that nanofluids containing a surfactant
   generally provided a modest increase in heat transfer rate when compared
   with tests performed using pure water. The largest increase was about
   17\% for a fluid with a concentration of 0.01\% by volume. Consequently,
   the gains in heat transfer do not appear to be accompanied by a
   significant pumping power penalty. The results of this study suggest
   that the use of a surfactant is essential in maintaining a proper
   suspension of nanoparticles in the fluid, especially at higher
   concentrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The standard assumption in (dynamic) traffic assignment models is that
   route choice is solely determined by a (perceived) deterministic travel
   time. However, recently, there is a growing interest in (dynamic)
   equilibrium route choice models in which travelers not only select their
   paths based on an estimated deterministic travel time, but also based on
   travel time reliability, in this article defined as the probability that
   the actual travel time deviates from the anticipated value. We extend
   the linear programming cell transmission model-based dynamic traffic
   assignment (LP CTM-DTA) model to account for travelers consideration of
   uncertainty regarding saturation flow rates (in this article referred to
   as capacities). It is shown that these reliability considerations can be
   accounted for by simply reducing the road capacities appearing in the
   constraint set of the classical LP CTM-DTA model. More importantly, we
   provide results on the amount of capacity reduction necessary to ensure
   a certain reliability level. Although in the proposed model any
   probability distribution can be used to model the uncertainty, the
   selection of a specific probability distribution can potentially be
   burdensome for the modeler. To this end, we also present results on the
   class of symmetric probability distributions that has been particularly
   popular in the robust optimization literature. Properties for this broad
   class of distributions will be derived within the context of the
   introduced model. In numerical case studies, the model predicts that
   travel patterns can be significantly different when accounting for
   travelers reliability considerations.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses how to efficiently and completely solve a

   parametric method is suggested to solve the bi-objective pavement
   maintenance and rehabilitation-scheduling problem. The effectiveness and
   efficiency of the parametric method is investigated and demonstrated
   through a case study using the real-world data set from the Dallas

Abstract = {{To capture the full spectrum of the fluctuating wall pressure beneath a
   turbulent boundary layer (TBL) provides a unique challenge in transducer
   design. This paper discusses the design, construction and testing of an
   array of surface-mounted piezoelectric ceramic elements with the goal of
   having both the spatial resolution and the frequency bandwidth to
   accurately sense the low-frequency, low-wavenumber events beneath a TBL
   at moderately low Reynolds numbers. The array is constructed from twenty
   1.27 cm tall prismatic rods with 0.18 cm x 0.16 cm cross-section made of
   Navy type II piezoelectric ceramic material. Calibration was performed
   by comparing the response of a Navy H56 precision-calibrated hydrophone
   to the outputs of each element on the array for a given input from a
   Navy J9 projector. The elements show an average sensitivity of - 184 dB
   (re: 1 V mu Pa-1) and are assembled with a centre-to-centre spacing of
   0.2 cm. Measurements of the fluctuating wall pressure below a 2d TBL
   with Reynolds numbers (based on momentum thickness) ranging from 2100 to
   4300 show that the dimensions of the elements are between 64 and 107
   viscous length units, respectively. A spatial and temporal footprint of
   the fluctuating wall pressure reveals convective speeds averaging 75\%
   of the free stream velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an alternative modality for
   cancer treatment. PDT works by initiating damaging oxidation or
   redox-sensitive pathways to trigger cell death. PDT can also regulate
   tumor angiogenesis and modulate systemic antitumor immunity. The
   drawbacks to PDT -- photosensitizer toxicity, a lack of selectivity and
   efficacy of photosensitizers, and a limited penetrance of light through
   deep tissues -- are the same pitfalls associated with diagnostic
   imaging. Developments in the field of nanotechnology have generated
   novel platforms for optimizing the advantages while minimizing the
   disadvantages of PDT. Calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs)
   represent an optimal nano-system for both diagnostic imaging and PDT. In
   this review, we will discuss how CPSNPs can enhance optical agents and
   serve as selective, non-toxic, and functionally stable photosensitizers
   for PDT. We will also examine novel applications of CPSNPs and PDT for
   the treatment of leukemia to illustrate their potential utility in
   cancer therapeutics. {[}Discovery Medicine 13(71):275-285, April 2012]}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the permanent deformation in asphalt binders under service
   load is an important step towards selecting the most appropriate asphalt
   binder for a flexible pavement. A model to predict the permanent strain
   in asphalt binders as a function of load duration and stress level at a
   constant temperature was developed in previous studies. In this
   approach, total strain was predicted as the summation of permanent and
   recoverable strain. This paper investigates the effect of temperature as
   an additional factor in this model.
   Considering the Arrhenius equation as the governing physicochemical rate
   process equation of many materials, it was hypothesized that temperature
   can be considered as an independent correction factor for permanent
   strain. This was verified by conducting a full factorial design and
   obtaining the interaction between temperature and other main factors.
   The significance of the factors was also computed to determine which
   factors should be incorporated in the prediction model. Analysis of the
   creep test results at different temperatures showed that the total
   strain under step loading follows the time-temperature superposition.
   Therefore, the recoverable strain in asphalt binders under a step
   loading at any given temperature can be predicted using the
   time-temperature superposition and Arrhenius equation.
   The model for prediction of the asphalt binder response was extended to
   include temperature as an additional factor. The extended model was
   verified under different loading conditions. This model will help
   engineers to better understand the rheology of asphalt binder and choose
   an appropriate asphalt binder based on traffic and environmental
   conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Depth filter microfiltration membranes produced from biodegradable
   poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) are reported in this paper. The asymmetric
   porous membranes reported here were formed via a process that combined

   served as efficient and rapid depth filters to retain bacterial cells
   when cell suspensions were filtered from the porous or rough side of the
   membrane, while serving as screen filters when the suspension was fed
   from the smooth skin side. After use, the depth filters were disposed of
   by non-enzymatic degradation - a process that was significantly
   accelerated in wet conditions at 60 degrees C, conditions under which
   composting is usually operated. The fact that the PLLA depth filters
   reported here can be disposed of by composting will help reduce
   industrial wastes in biochemical and food industries when they are used
   as a pre-filter. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   with atrial arrhythmias premature beats, tachycardias, atrial
   fibrillation, and flutter generally being of higher frequency during the
   day than night and ventricular fibrillation and ventricular premature
   beats more common, respectively, in the morning and during the daytime
   activity than sleep span. Furthermore, different circadian patterns of
   blood pressure are found in arterial hypertension, in relation to
   different cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Such temporal
   patterns result from circadian periodicity in pathophysiological
   mechanisms that give rise to predictable-in-time differences in
   susceptibility-resistance to cyclic environmental stressors that trigger
   these clinical events. Circadian rhythms also may affect the
   pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular and other
   medications. Knowledge of 24-h patterns in the risk of cardiac
   arrhythmias and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality plus
   circadian rhythm-dependencies of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms
   suggests the requirement for preventive and therapeutic interventions is
   not the same throughout the day and night, and should be tailored
   accordingly to improve outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent advances in global positioning systems (GPS) technology have
   resulted in a transition in household travel survey methods to test the
   use of GPS units to record travel details, followed by the application
   of an algorithm to both identify trips and impute trip purpose,
   typically supplemented with some level of respondent confirmation via
   prompted-recall surveys. As the research community evaluates this new
   approach to potentially replace the traditional survey-reported
   collection method, it is important to consider how well the GPS-recorded
   and algorithm-imputed details capture trip details and whether the
   traditional survey-reported collection method may be preferred with
   regards to some types of travel. This paper considers two measures of
   travel intensity (survey-reported and GPS-recorded) for two trip
   purposes (work and non-work) as dependent variables in a joint ordered
   response model. The empirical analysis uses a sample from the full-study
   of the 2009 Indianapolis regional household travel survey. Individuals
   in this sample provided diary details about their travel survey day as
   well as carried wearable GPS units for the same 24-h period. The
   empirical results provide important insights regarding differences in
   measures of travel intensities related to the two different data
   collection modes (diary and GPS). The results suggest that more research
   is needed in the development of workplace identification algorithms,
   that GPS should continue to be used alongside rather than in lieu of the
   traditional diary approach, and that assignment of individuals to the
   GPS or diary survey approach should consider demographics and other
   characteristics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a considerable insult to skeletal
   muscle, often resulting in prolonged functional deficits. The purpose of
   the current study was to evaluate the controlled release of the
   pro-regenerative growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I),
   from a biodegradable polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated fibrin gel matrix
   and the subsequent recovery of skeletal muscle from I/R. To accomplish
   this, the hind limbs of male SpragueDawley rats were subjected to 2-h
   tourniquet-induced I/R then treated with saline, bolus IGF-I (bIGF),
   PEGylated fibrin gel (PEG-Fib), or IGF-I conjugated PEGylated fibrin gel
   (PEG-Fib-IGF). Functional and histological evaluations were performed
   following 14 days of reperfusion, and muscles from 4-day reperfusion
   animals were analyzed by Western blotting and histological assessments.
   There was no difference in functional recovery between saline, bIGF, or
   PEG-Fib groups. However, PEG-Fib-IGF treatment resulted in significant
   improvement of muscle function and structure, as observed
   histologically. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was significantly
   elevated in PEG-Fib-IGF muscles, compared to PEG-Fib treatment, at 4
   days of reperfusion, suggesting involvement of the pathway PI3K/Akt as a
   mediator of the improved function. Surprisingly, myoblast activity was
   not evident as a result of PEG-Fib-IGF treatment. Taken together, these
   data give evidence for a protective role for the delivered IGF. These
   results indicate that PEG-Fib-IGF is a viable therapeutic technique in
   the treatment of skeletal muscle I/R injury. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012;

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{563-577}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes the use of microprocessor performance counters for
   online measurement of complete system power consumption. The approach
   takes advantage of the ``trickle-down{''} effect of performance events
   in microprocessors. While it has been known that CPU power consumption
   is correlated to processor performance, the use of well-known
   performance-related events within a microprocessor such as cache misses
   and DMA transactions to estimate power consumption in memory and disk
   and other subsystems outside of the microprocessor is new. Using
   measurement of actual systems running scientific, commercial and
   productivity workloads, power models for six subsystems (CPU, memory,
   chipset, I/O, disk, and GPU) on two platforms (server and desktop) are
   developed and validated. These models are shown to have an average error
   of less than nine percent per subsystem across the considered workloads.
   Through the use of these models and existing on-chip performance event
   counters, it is possible to estimate system power consumption without
   the need for power sensing hardware.}},

   with one-dimensional gratings, that the distinctly different nature of
   the gratings can provide complementary enhancement mechanisms, which we
   further exploit by tailoring the specific periodicities, and by
   introducing blazing. Having different periods at specific interfaces
   allows for more efficient diffraction into both plasmonic and dielectric
   guided modes. In addition, grating specific blazing exposes extra modes
   to normal incident light through symmetry breaking. Multiple

Title = {{Automatic geomorphic feature extraction from lidar in flat and
   engineered landscapes}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{High-resolution topographic data derived from light detection and
   ranging (lidar) technology enables detailed geomorphic observations to
   be made on spatially extensive areas in a way that was previously not
   possible. Availability of this data provides new opportunities to study
   the spatial organization of landscapes and channel network features,
   increase the accuracy of environmental transport models, and inform
   decisions for targeting conservation practices. However, with the
   opportunity of increased resolution topographic data come formidable
   challenges in terms of automatic geomorphic feature extraction,
   analysis, and interpretation. Low-relief landscapes are particularly
   challenging because topographic gradients are low, and in many places
   both the landscape and the channel network have been heavily modified by
   humans. This is especially true for agricultural landscapes, which
   dominate the midwestern United States. The goal of this work is to
   address several issues related to feature extraction in flat lands by
   using GeoNet, a recently developed method based on nonlinear multiscale
   filtering and geodesic optimization for automatic extraction of
   geomorphic features (channel heads and channel networks) from
   high-resolution topographic data. Here we test the ability of GeoNet to
   extract channel networks in flat and human-impacted landscapes using 3 m
   lidar data for the Le Sueur River Basin, a 2880 km(2) subbasin of the
   Minnesota River Basin. We propose a curvature analysis to differentiate
   between channels and manmade structures that are not part of the river
   network, such as roads and bridges. We document that Laplacian curvature
   more effectively distinguishes channels in flat, human-impacted
   landscapes compared with geometric curvature. In addition, we develop a
   method for performing automated channel morphometric analysis including
   extraction of cross sections, detection of bank locations, and
   identification of geomorphic bankfull water surface elevation. Using the
   slope plotted along each channel-floodplain cross section, we
   demonstrate the ability to identify and measure the height of river
   banks and bluffs. Finally, we present an example that demonstrates how
   extracting such features automatically is important for modeling channel
   evolution, water and sediment transport, and channel-floodplain sediment
   exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous publications have demonstrated that thin glassy polymer
   films respond to highly sorbing penetrants, such as CO2, quite
   differently than thick films. These studies focused on CO2 permeation
   behavior and revealed that, for thin films, CO2 permeability at constant
   CO2 pressure goes through a maximum followed by a continual decrease in
   permeability owing to physical aging. So far, thick and thin glassy
   polymer films have been compared in the context of permeability, but
   lack of substantial means of obtaining thin film sorption data has
   prevented adequate comparison of thick and thin films in the context of
   gas solubility. In this paper, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to
   obtain simultaneously the film thickness and CO2 sorption capacity for
   thin glassy polymer films. This allows a more comprehensive look at CO2
   permeability, sorption, and diffusivity as a function of both CO2
   pressure and exposure time. The evidence reported here suggests that
   thin film sorption behavior is substantially different than that of
   thick film counterparts. Partial molar volume is determined from
   sorption-induced swelling data. Fractional free volume and diffusivity
   are calculated as a function of CO2 pressure. Dual sorption model
   parameters are presented for Matrimid thin films for different aging
   times. Dynamic ellipsometry experiments show that refractive index
   minima, fractional free volume maxima, and CO2 diffusivity maxima
   correlate well with observed CO2 permeability maxima observed for thin
   Matrimid films. The results support the claim that plasticization and
   physical aging are competing processes but that aging dominates over
   long time scales. The CO2 diffusivity behavior over time is most
   affected by the competing effects of plasticization and aging, and the
   evolution of CO2 diffusivity is shown to be the main contributing factor
   to changes in CO2 permeability at constant pressure.}},

Title = {{Feasibility and Safety of Dabigatran Versus Warfarin for Periprocedural
   Anticoagulation in Patients Undergoing Radiofrequency Ablation for
   Atrial Fibrillation Results From a Multicenter Prospective Registry}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and
   safety of periprocedural dabigatran during atrial fibrillation (AF)
   ablation.
   Background AF ablation requires optimal periprocedural anticoagulation
   for minimizing bleeding and thromboembolic complications. The safety and
   efficacy of dabigatran as a periprocedural anticoagulant for AF ablation
   are unknown.
   Methods We performed a multicenter, observational study from a
   prospective registry including all consecutive patients undergoing AF
   ablation in 8 high-volume centers in the United States. All patients
   receiving dabigatran therapy who underwent AF ablation on periprocedural
   dabigatran, with the dose held on the morning of the procedure, were
   matched by age, sex, and type of AF with an equal number of patients
   undergoing AF ablation with uninterrupted warfarin therapy over the same
   period.
   Results A total of 290 patients, including 145 taking periprocedural
   dabigatran and an equal number of matched patients taking uninterrupted
   periprocedural warfarin, were included in the study. The mean age was 60
   years with 79\% being male and 57\% having paroxysmal AF. Both groups
   had a similar CHADS(2) score, left atrial size, and left ventricular
   ejection fraction. Three thromboembolic complications (2.1\%) occurred
   in the dabigatran group compared with none in the warfarin group (p =
   0.25). The dabigatran group had a significantly higher major bleeding
   rate (6\% vs. 1\%; p = 0.019), total bleeding rate (14\% vs. 6\%; p =
   0.031), and composite of bleeding and thromboembolic complications (16\%
   vs. 6\%; p = 0.009) compared with the warfarin group. Dabigatran use was
   confirmed as an independent predictor of bleeding or thromboembolic
   complications (odds ratio: 2.76, 95\% confidence interval: 1.22 to 6.25;
   p = 0.01) on multivariate regression analysis.
   Conclusions In patients undergoing AF ablation, periprocedural
   dabigatran use significantly increases the risk of bleeding or
   thromboembolic complications compared with uninterrupted warfarin
   therapy. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012; 59: 1168-74) (C) 2012 by the American

Abstract = {{Dynamic simulation results for a thermal energy storage (TES) unit used
   in a parabolic trough concentrated solar power (CSP) system are
   presented. A two-tank-direct method is used for the thermal energy
   storage. While previous works have been focused largely on controlling
   the outlet temperature of the solar collector as a single unit, this
   work emphasizes the storage component, its interaction with the other
   components of the system, and how it can be leveraged to control power
   output in addition to collector outlet temperature. The use of storage
   gives the system the ability to provide power at a constant rate despite
   significant disturbances in the amount of solar radiation available. It
   can also shift times of power generation to better match times of
   consumer demand. By contrast, a CSP system without storage undergoes
   large fluctuations in power output, particularly during intermittent
   cloud cover. Adding a storage system increases the solar share of the
   power plant by as much as 47\% for a base load thermal power output of 1
   MW. This reduces the supplementary fuel requirement by as much as 43\%.

Abstract = {{Ba2Co9O14 is a charge-ordered Co2+/3+ cobaltite that consists of
   building blocks of CdI2-type Co2+/3+ O-6/3 layers, face-shared Co3+
   O-3(12) octahedral trimers, and corner-sharing Co2+O4 tetrahedra. The
   Co-L-2,L-3 x-ray absorption spectroscopy spectrum at room temperature
   indicates a high and a low spin state for Co2+ and Co3+ ions,
   respectively. Measurements of high-temperature resistivity and
   thermoelectric power revealed an insulator-to-insulator phase transition
   at T-t = 570 K, above which the inverse magnetic susceptibility
   chi(-1)(T) deviates from the Curie-Weiss law. By using a combination of
   soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the O-K edge and high-resolution

Abstract = {{A force-matching method is employed to optimize the parameters of the
   Stillinger-Weber (SW) interatomic potential for calculation of the

   crystalline Si at 300-500 K estimated using nonequilibrium molecular
   dynamics with the modified parameter set show excellent agreement with
   existing experimental data. We also briefly discuss how the
   force-matching-based parameterization can provide the improved
   estimation of thermal conductivity, as compared to the original SW
   parameter set, through analysis of phonon density of states and phonon
   dispersion relations.}},

Abstract = {{Disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)s are high glass transition
   temperature polymers, and their water and salt transport properties
   depend sensitively on thermal processing history. In this study, films
   of a 32 mol\% disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) random copolymer
   (BPS-32), polymerized in the potassium counter-ion form, were acidified
   using solid state and solution routes. The resulting acid counter-ion
   form materials were then converted to sodium, potassium, and calcium
   counter-ion forms via ion exchange. Additionally, several films were
   subjected to various thermal treatments in the solid state. Water uptake
   as well as water and NaCl permeability of these BPS-32 films were
   measured. Acidification via immersion of BPS-32 films in boiling
   sulfuric acid solution increased water uptake, and water and salt
   permeability increased. Exposure of samples to elevated temperature also
   influenced transport properties. For example, immersing BPS-32 films in
   boiling water for 4 h increased water sorption by 50\%, water
   permeability by 2.3 times, and NaCl permeability by 8 times. The
   counter-ion form of the sulfonated polymer influenced the polymer's
   transport properties, but these effects were weaker than the effect of
   thermal treatment. Generally, the BPS-32 samples prepared with different
   processing histories followed a trade-off between water/salt
   permeability selectivity and water permeability. These results suggest
   that, like many other glassy polymers, thermal processing history
   influences small molecule transport in these materials. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Antibodies binding to conserved epitopes can provide a broad range of
   neutralization to existing influenza subtypes and may also prevent the
   propagation of potential pandemic viruses by fighting against emerging
   strands. Here we propose a computational framework to study structural
   binding patterns and detailed molecular mechanisms of viral surface
   glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) binding with a broad spectrum of
   neutralizing monoclonal antibody fragments (Fab). We used rigorous
   free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods to calculate the antigen-antibody
   binding affinities, with an aggregate underlying molecular-dynamics
   simulation time of several microseconds (similar to 2 mu s) using
   all-atom, explicit-solvent models. We achieved a high accuracy in the
   validation of our FEP protocol against a series of known binding
   affinities for this complex system, with <0.5 kcal/mol errors on
   average. We then introduced what to our knowledge are novel mutations
   into the interfacial region to further study the binding mechanism. We
   found that the stacking interaction between Trp-21 in HA2 and Phe-55 in
   the CDR-H2 of Fab is crucial to the antibody-antigen association. A
   single mutation of either W21A or F55A can cause a binding affinity
   decrease of Delta Delta G > 4.0 kcal/mol (equivalent to an similar to
   1000-fold increase in the dissociation constant K-d). Moreover, for
   group 1 HA subtypes (which include both the H1N1 swine flu and the H5N1
   bird flu), the relative binding affinities change only slightly (< +/- 1
   kcal/mol) when nonpolar residues at the alpha A helix of HA mutate to
   conservative amino acids of similar size, which explains the broad
   neutralization capability of antibodies such as F10 and CR6261. Finally,
   we found that the hydrogen-bonding network between His-38 (in HA1) and
   Ser-30/Gln-64 (in Fab) is important for preserving the strong binding of
   Fab against group 1 HAs, whereas the lack of such hydrogen bonds with
   Asn-38 in most group 2 HAs may be responsible for the escape of antibody
   neutralization. These large-scale simulations may provide new insight
   into the antigen-antibody binding mechanism at the atomic level, which
   could be essential for designing more-effective vaccines for influenza.}},

Abstract = {{The various polymorphs (anatase, rutile, and brookite) of TiO2 with
   different nanomorphologies have been synthesized by a facile
   microwave-assisted solvothermal process without surfactants, employing

   X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
   (BET) surface area analysis. The Ti/Cl ion concentration, reaction pH,
   and size of the alcohol molecule are found to control the morphology,
   crystal structure, and crystallite size of the TiO2 particles. Among the
   various TiO2 polymorphs synthesized, the rutile TiO2 spheres built up of
   nanorods that were synthesized with TiCl4 in octanol have an average
   pore size and surface area of, respectively, 5 nm and 404 m(2)/g and
   exhibit the best electrochemical performance with a capacity of >200
   mAh/g after 100 cycles and high rate capability. The excellent
   electrochemical properties originate from the nanorod-building

Title = {{A common, non-optimal phenotypic endpoint in experimental adaptations of
   bacteriophage lysis time}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Optimality models of evolution, which ignore genetic details
   and focus on natural selection, are widely used but sometimes criticized
   as oversimplifications. Their utility for quantitatively predicting
   phenotypic evolution can be tested experimentally. One such model
   predicts optimal bacteriophage lysis interval, how long a virus should
   produce progeny before lysing its host bacterium to release them. The
   genetic basis of this life history trait is well studied in many easily
   propagated phages, making it possible to test the model across a variety
   of environments and taxa.
   Results: We adapted two related small single-stranded DNA phages, Phi
   X174 and ST-1, to various conditions. The model predicted the evolution
   of the lysis interval in response to host density and other
   environmental factors. In all cases the initial phages lysed later than
   predicted. The FX174 lysis interval did not evolve detectably when the
   phage was adapted to normal hosts, indicating complete failure of
   optimality predictions. Phi X174 grown on slyD defective hosts which
   initially entirely prevented lysis readily recovered to a lysis interval
   similar to that attained on normal hosts. Finally, the lysis interval
   still evolved to the same endpoint when the environment was altered to
   delay optimal lysis interval. ST-1 lysis interval evolved to be similar
   to 2 min shorter, qualitatively in accord with predictions. However,
   there were no changes in the single known lysis gene. Part of ST-1's
   total lysis time evolution consisted of an earlier start to progeny
   production, an unpredicted phenotypic response outside the boundaries of
   the optimality model.
   Conclusions: The consistent failure of the optimality model suggests
   that constraint and genetic details affect quantitative and even
   qualitative success of optimality predictions. Several features of ST-1
   adaptation show that lysis time is best understood as an output of
   multiple traits, rather than in isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional integration with through-silicon vias (TSVs) has
   emerged as an effective solution to overcome the wiring limit imposed on
   device density and performance. However, thermal stresses induced in TSV
   structures raise serious thermomechanical reliability concerns. In this
   paper, we analyze the near-surface stress distribution in a TSV
   structure based on a semi-analytic approach and finite element method,
   in comparison with micro-Raman measurements. In particular, the depth
   dependence of the stress distribution and the effect of elastic
   anisotropy of Si are illustrated to properly interpret the Raman data.
   The effects of the surface oxide layer and metal plasticity of the via
   material on the stress and Raman measurements are discussed. The
   near-surface stress characteristics revealed by the modeling and Raman
   measurements are important for design of TSV structures and device
   integration. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The photodissociation and geminate recombination of nitric oxide in
   myoglobin, under continuous illumination, is modeled computationally.
   The relaxation of the photon energy into the protein matrix is also
   considered in a single simulation scheme that mimics a complete
   experimental setup. The dynamic approach to non-equilibrium molecular
   dynamics is used, starting from a steady state, to compute its
   relaxation to equilibrium. Simulations are conducted for the native form
   of sperm whale myoglobin and for two other mutants, V68W and L29F,
   illustrating a fair diversity of spatial and temporal geminate
   recombination processes. Energy flow to the heme and immediate protein
   environment provide hints to allostery. In particular, a pathway of
   energy flow between the heme and the FG loop is illustrated. Although
   the simulations were conducted for myoglobin only, the thermal
   fluctuations of the FG corner are in agreement with the large structural
   shifts of FG during the allosteric transition of tetrameric hemoglobin.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of visible-light-active thin films of p-CuBi2O4

   and Bi were deposited from a single bath onto fluorine-doped tin oxide

   deposition parameters such as potential, time, and bath concentration
   were investigated. In general, the films consisted of interconnected
   particles roughly 250 nm in diameter and showed an onset of light
   absorption at 680 nm (1.8 eV). The films were characterized by
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) techniques in order to provide insight into
   the critical PEC properties of CuBi2O4 such as flat-band potential,
   photocurrent stability, and incident photon-to-current efficiency
   (IPCE). Despite the narrow band gap and quite suitable band edge
   positions for PEC H-2 generation, the films' stable calculated AM1.5G
   photocurrents in N-2 degassed Na2SO4 were relatively small (44-55 mu
   A/cm(2) at 0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl) due to maximum UV quantum yields of similar
   to 1-2\% that decreased significantly throughout the visible range,
   becoming negligible near 700 nm. Film stability tests under constant
   illumination revealed that the films were unstable in acidic electrolyte
   (pH 3.5) due to the reduction and dissolution of Cu but were stable in
   basic electrolyte (pH 10.8) after an initial similar to 50\% decrease in
   performance.}},

   Kinase by NH125: Evidence of a Common in Vitro Artifact}},

Abstract = {{Evidence that elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2K) has potential as a
   target for anticancer therapy and possibly for the treatment of
   depression is emerging. Here the steady-state kinetic mechanism of
   eEF-2K is presented using a peptide substrate and is shown to conform to
   an ordered sequential mechanism with ATP binding first. Substrate
   inhibition by the peptide was observed and revealed to be competitive
   with ATP, explaining the observed ordered mechanism. Several small
   molecules are reported to inhibit eEF-2K activity with the most notable
   being the histidine kinase inhibitor NH125, which has been used in a
   number of studies to characterize eEF-2K activity in cells. While NH125
   was previously reported to inhibit eEF-2K in vitro with an IC50 of 60
   nM, its mechanism of action was not established. Using the same kinetic
   assay, the ability of an authentic sample of NH125 to inhibit eEF-2K was
   assessed over a range of substrate and inhibitor concentrations. A
   typical dose-response curve for the inhibition of eEF-2K by NH125 is
   best fit to an IC50 of 18 +/- 0.25 mu M and a Hill coefficient of 3.7
   +/- 0.14, suggesting that NH125 is a weak inhibitor of eEF-2K under the
   experimental conditions of a standard in vitro kinase assay. To test the
   possibility that NH125 is a potent inhibitor of eEF2 phosphorylation, we
   assessed its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of eEF2. Under
   standard kinase assay conditions, NH125 exhibits a similar weak ability
   to inhibit the phosphorylation of eEF2 by eEF-2K. Notably, the activity
   of NH125 is severely abrogated by the addition of 0.1\% Triton to the
   kinase assay through a process that can be reversed upon dilution. These
   studies suggest that NH125 is a nonspecific colloidal aggregator in
   vitro, a notion further supported by the observation that NH125 inhibits
   other protein kinases, such as ERK2 and TRPM7 in a manner similar to
   that of eEF-2K. As NH125 is reported to inhibit eEF-2K in a cellular
   environment, its ability to inhibit eEF2 phosphorylation was assessed in
   MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, A549 lung cancer, and HEK-293T cell lines
   using a Western blot approach. No sign of a decrease in the level of
   eEF2 phosphorylation was observed up to 12 h following addition of NH125
   to the media. Furthermore, contrary to the previously reported
   literatures, NH125 induced the phosphorylation of eEF-2.}},

Abstract = {{Molecularly imprinted polymers are synthetic antibody mimics formed by
   the crosslinking of organic or inorganic polymers in the presence of an
   analyte which yields recognitive polymer networks with specific binding
   pockets for that biomolecule. Surface imprinted polymers were
   synthesized via a novel technique for the specific recognition of bovine
   serum albumin (BSA). Thin films of recognitive networks based on
   2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) as the functional monomer
   and varying amounts of either N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) or
   poly(ethylene glycol) (400) dimethacrylate (PEG400DMA) as the
   crosslinking agent were synthesized via UV free-radical polymerization
   and characterized. A clear and reproducible increase in recognition of
   the template BSA was demonstrated for these systems at 1.6-2.5 times
   more BSA recognized by the MIP sample relative to the control polymers.
   Additionally, these polymers exhibited selective recognition of the
   template relative to competing proteins with up to 2.9 times more BSA
   adsorbed than either glucose oxidase or bovine hemoglobin. These
   synthetic antibody mimics hold significant promise as the next
   generation of robust recognition elements in a wide range of bioassay
   and biosensor applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ether block amide) (PEBA) thermoplastic elastomers are used in many
   different applications, with recent development being on those which
   show promise as high gas flux membranes. PEBA copolymers with high
   polyether soft block content are possible candidates for gas separation
   applications due to their high permeability relative to current
   commercially used polymers and good selectivity for acid gases such as
   CO2. To be effective and efficient, the high flux must be maintained
   over the course of production and use. A series of PEBA copolymers
   containing poly(tetramethylene oxide) and polyamide-12 was studied to
   explore the influence of mechanical orientation and copolymer
   composition on gas permeability and morphology. Upon uniaxial
   orientation, several compositions of PEBA copolymers exhibited a
   significant decrease in permeability, both in the oriented and
   elastically recovered states. Copolymer composition strongly influenced
   the degree of change seen in the permeability upon orientation. WAXS and
   DSC were used to identify strain-induced crystallization that occurred
   during orientation. Rubbery materials can crystallize under high
   strains, and PEBA is no exception. Strain-induced crystallization of the
   polyether blocks produced a tortuous path for gas diffusion, resulting
   in as much as a 3.5 x decrease in permeability for oriented PEBA films.
   To maintain high flux for membrane applications, elastic recovery and
   thermal treatment proved beneficial in reversing the effects of uniaxial
   orientation on PEBA copolymers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Cellular transport machinery, such as channels and pumps, is working
   against the background of unassisted material transport through
   membranes. The permeation of a blocked tryptophan through a
   1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) membrane is investigated
   to probe unassisted or physical transport. The transport rate is
   measured experimentally and modeled computationally. The time scale
   measured by parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA)
   experiments is similar to 8 h. Simulations with the milestoning
   algorithm suggest mean first passage time (MFPT) of similar to 4 and the
   presence of a large barrier at the center of the bilayer. A similar
   calculation with the solubility-diffusion model yields a MFPT of similar
   to 15 min. This permeation rate is 9 orders of magnitude slower than the
   permeation rate of only a tryptophan side chain (computed by us and
   others). This difference suggests critical dependence of transport time
   on permeant size and hydrophilicity. Analysis of the simulation results
   suggests that the permeant partially preserves hydrogen bonding of the
   peptide backbone to water and lipid molecules even when it is moving
   closer to the bilayer center. As a consequence, defects of the membrane
   structure are developed to assist permeation.}},

   Pt dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) containing an average of

   Pt(100) and Pt(111) facets of the DENs. Partial Cu shells on Pt-147 are
   more stable on the Pt(100) facets, compared to the Pt(111) facets, and

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites of polysaccharide matrices, chitosan starch, and
   carboxymethyl cellulose-starch reinforced with graphene oxide and
   graphene grafted with keratin were developed. Composites films had been
   prepared for the casting/solvent evaporation method. The interaction and
   distribution of graphene materials in the biopolymer matrices were
   analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman
   spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the
   thermomechanical properties were examined using dynamic mechanical
   analysis. The nanocomposites of the chitosan-starch matrix improved
   their mechanical properties substantially, with respect to the film
   without reinforcing, obtaining an increase of 929\% in the storage
   modulus (E', 35 degrees C) with only 0.5 wt \% of graphene oxide and
   outstanding increments in E' at 150 and 200 degrees C when
   keratin-grafted graphene oxide is incorporated (0.1 wt \%). In contrast,
   the graphene oxide incorporated into the carboxymethyl cellulose-starch
   matrix tends to decrease the stiffness of the film, behaving in a manner
   opposite to that of nanocomposites of the chitosan-starch matrix.
   Similarly, the incorporation of graphene grafted with keratin shows a
   decrease in the rigidity of the resulting material. In this way, the
   importance of compatibility between the graphene and the host matrix to
   achieve a fine control of interface and manipulate the final properties
   of the material is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical explanation on how PdAu alloy catalysts can
   enhance the oxidation of CO molecules based on density functional theory
   calculations of CO adsorption and oxidation on AuPd/Pd(111) surfaces.
   Our study suggests that the enhanced activity is largely attributed to
   the possible existence of ``partially-poisoned{''} Pd ensembles that
   accommodate fewer CO molecules than Pd atoms. Whereas the oxidation of
   preadsorbed CO is likely governed by O-2 trapping, our study shows that
   small Pd ensembles such as dimers and compact trimers tend to provide
   more active sites than larger ensembles; CO adsorbed on a Pd monomer is
   found to react hardly with O-2 to form CO2. In addition, we find the
   tendency of CO-induced Pd agglomeration, which may in turn facilitate CO
   oxidation by creating more dimers and compact trimers as compared with
   the adsorbate-free surface where monomers are likely prevailing.}},

   were prepared using 1 wt\%, 3 wt\%, and 5 wt\% of NGPs. Isopropyl
   alcohol (IPA) was used as a solvent to assist in dispersion of the NGPs
   within the PA11 powder. The NGPs were hand mixed evenly into the PA11
   powder using a wooden dowel. Morphological characterization of the
   PA11/NGP nanocomposite was conducted using scanning electron microscopy.
   Thermal characterization of nanocomposites includes thermogravimetric
   analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and thermomechanical
   analysis. Results indicate that the addition of NGPs shows an initial
   increase in thermal stability and crystallization temperature (T-c)
   along with a decrease in glass transition temperature (T-g) and no
   improvement in coefficient of thermal expansion (alpha). These results
   are attributed to improved interfacial adhesion between NGPs and PA11,

Abstract = {{Due to their role in cellular signaling mitogen activated protein (MAP)
   kinases represent targets of pharmaceutical interest. However, the
   majority of known MAP kinase inhibitors compete with cellular ATP and
   target an ATP binding pocket that is highly conserved in the 500 plus
   representatives of the human protein kinase family. Here we review
   progress toward the development of non-ATP competitive MAP kinase
   inhibitors for the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2), the
   c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3) and the p38 MAPKs (alpha, beta,
   gamma, and delta). Special emphasis is placed on the role of
   computational methods in the drug discovery process for MAP kinases.
   Topics include recent advances in X-ray crystallography theory that
   improve the MAP kinase structures essential to structure-based drug
   discovery, the use of molecular dynamics to understand the
   conformational heterogeneity of the activation loop and inhibitors
   discovered by virtual screening. The impact of an advanced polarizable
   force field such as AMOEBA used in conjunction with sophisticated
   kinetic and thermodynamic simulation methods is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Vocal fold scarring is a predominant cause of voice disorders yet lacks
   a reliable treatment method. The injection of soft biomaterials to
   improve mechanical compliance of the vocal folds has emerged as a
   promising treatment. Here, we study the use of precise femtosecond laser
   microsurgery to ablate subsurface voids, with a goal of eventually
   creating a plane in dense subepithelial scar tissue into which
   biomaterials can be injected for their improved localization.
   Specifically, we demonstrate the ablation of small subepithelial voids
   in porcine vocal fold tissue up to 120 mu m below the surface such that
   larger voids in the active area of vocal fold mucosa (similar to 3 x 10
   mm(2)) can eventually be ablated in about 3 min. We use sub-mu J, 776-nm
   pulses from a compact femtosecond fiber laser system operating at a
   500-kHz repetition rate. The use of relatively high repetition rates,
   with a small number of overlapping pulses, is critical to achieving
   ablation in a very short time while still avoiding significant heat
   deposition. Additionally, we use the same laser for nonlinear optical
   imaging to provide visual feedback of tissue structure and to confirm
   successful ablation. The ablation parameters, including pulse duration,
   pulse energy, spot size, and scanning speed, are comparable to the
   specifications in our recently developed miniaturized femtosecond laser
   surgery probes, illustrating the feasibility of developing an ultrafast
   laser surgical instrument. 2072 Society of Photooptical Instrumentation

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the ability of combined
   photothermal wave (PTW) imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   to detect, and further characterize the distribution of macrophages
   (having taken up plasmonic gold nanorose as a contrast agent) and lipid
   deposits in atherosclerotic plaques. Aortas with atherosclerotic plaques
   were harvested from nine male New Zealand white rabbits divided into
   nanorose- and saline-injected groups and were imaged by dual-wavelength
   (800 and 1210 nm) multifrequency (0.1, 1 and 4 Hz) PTW imaging in
   combination with OCT. Amplitude PTW images suggest that lateral and
   depth distribution of nanorose-loaded macrophages (confirmed by
   two-photon luminescence microscopy and RAM-11 macrophage stain) and
   lipid deposits can be identified at selected modulation frequencies.
   Radiometric temperature increase and modulation amplitude of superficial
   nanoroses in response to 4 Hz laser irradiation (800 nm) were
   significantly higher than native plaque (P < 0.001). Amplitude PTW
   images (4 Hz) were merged into a coregistered OCT image, suggesting that
   superficial nanorose-loaded macrophages are distributed at shoulders on
   the upstream side of atherosclerotic plaques (P < 0.001) at edges of
   lipid deposits. Results suggest that combined PTW-OCT imaging can
   simultaneously reveal plaque structure and composition, permitting
   characterization of nanorose-loaded macrophages and lipid deposits in
   atherosclerotic plaques. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Drainage methods for liquefaction remediation have been in use since the
   1970s and have traditionally included stone columns, gravel drains, and
   more recently prefabricated vertical drains. This paper presents the
   results from a dynamic centrifuge test designed to evaluate the
   performance of a liquefiable site treated with prefabricated vertical
   drains. The centrifuge model consisted of gently sloping, untreated and
   treated liquefiable soil deposits overlain by a clay crust. The model
   was subjected to multiple shaking events that included both recorded
   earthquake acceleration-time histories and sinusoidal input motions.
   Comparisons of deformations and excess pore water pressures in the
   untreated and treated areas showed that drains were effective in
   expediting the dissipation of excess pore water pressures and reducing
   deformations. However, depending on the characteristics of the input
   ground motion, the peak excess pore pressures in the treated area were
   not always substantially smaller than in the untreated area.
   Nevertheless, the deformations in the treated area were consistently
   smaller, which illustrates that the peak excess pore pressure ratio may
   not be a good indicator of overall performance. On the basis of the data
   from the centrifuge test, a better indicator of overall performance may
   be the time spent at elevated excess pore water pressures, which related
   better to the magnitude of the resulting deformations. DOI:

   the structure at frequencies above the plasmonic cut-off. The field
   distribution, propagation and attenuation constants of the leaky-wave
   are extracted from simulation and measurement, and compared with the
   predictions based on a rigorous homogenization model. Next, directive
   radiation into the air region through the leaky-wave mechanism is
   explored. It is found that a directive, frequency scanned beam can be
   formed outside the cut-wire array. The phenomenon is demonstrated
   through theory, simulations and measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a canonical dual mixed finite element method for the
   post-buckling analysis of planar beams with large elastic deformations.
   The mathematical beam model employed in the present work was introduced
   by Gao in 1996, and is governed by a fourth-order non-linear
   differential equation. The total potential energy associated with this
   model is a non-convex functional and can be used to study both the pre-
   and the post-buckling responses of the beams. Using the so-called
   canonical duality theory, this non-convex primal variational problem is
   transformed into a dual problem. In a proper feasible space, the dual
   variational problem corresponds to a globally concave maximization
   problem. A mixed finite element method involving both the transverse
   displacement field and the stress field as approximate element functions
   is derived from the dual variational problem and used to compute global
   optimal solutions. Numerical applications are illustrated by several
   problems with different boundary conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Changes in step width (SW), step length (SL), and/or the variability of
   these parameters have been prospectively related to risk of falling.
   However, it is unknown how voluntary changes in SW and SL directly alter
   variability and/or dynamic stability of walking. Here, we quantified how
   variability and dynamic stability of human walking changed when
   individuals voluntarily manipulated SW and SL 14 unimpaired, young
   adults walked on a treadmill at their preferred walking speed with
   normal gait, with a metronome and with narrower, wider, shorter and
   longer steps than normal. Taking narrower steps caused increased SL
   variability while mediolateral (ML) movements of the C7 vertebra (i.e.,
   trunk) became locally more stable (p < 0.05) and anterior-posterior (AP)
   C7 movements became locally less stable (p < 0.05). Taking wider steps
   caused increased SW and SL variability, while ML C7 movements became
   both locally and orbitally less stable (p < 0.05). Any change in SL
   caused increased SW, SL, and stride time variability. When taking
   shorter steps, ML C7 movements exhibited greater short-term local and
   orbital instability, while AP C7 movements exhibited decreased
   short-term and long-term local instability (p < 0.05). When taking
   longer steps, AP, ML and vertical C7 movements all exhibited increased
   long-term local instability and increased orbital instability (p <
   0.05). Correlations between mean SW, SL and dynamic stability of C7
   marker motions were weak. However, short-term voluntary changes in SW
   and SL did significantly alter local and orbital stability of trunk
   motions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   designs guided by mechanics modeling, they can be combined with
   elastomeric supports to yield integrated devices that offer linear
   elastic responses to large strain (similar to 100\%) deformations. The
   result is an electronics/optoelectronics technology that offers the
   performance of conventional wafer-based systems, but with the mechanics

   We report on van der Waals (VDW) epitaxy of InAs nanowires vertically
   aligned on graphene substrates using metal organic chemical vapor
   deposition. The strong correlation between the growth direction of InAs
   nanowires and surface roughness of graphene substrates was investigated
   using various graphene films with different numbers of stacked layers.
   Notably, vertically well-aligned InAs nanowire arrays were obtained
   easily on single-layer graphene substrates with sufficiently strong VDW
   attraction. This study presents a considerable advance toward the VDW
   heteroepitaxy of inorganic nanostructures on chemical vapor-deposited
   large-area graphenes. More importantly, this work demonstrates the
   thinnest epitaxial substrate material that yields vertical nanowire
   arrays by the VDW epitaxy method.}},

Abstract = {{A protocol to generate parameters for the AMOEBA polarizable force field
   for small organic molecules has been established, and polarizable atomic
   typing utility, Poltype, which fully automates this process, has been
   implemented. For validation, we have compared with quantum mechanical
   calculations of molecular dipole moments, optimized geometry,
   electrostatic potential, and conformational energy for a variety of
   neutral and charged organic molecules, as well as dimer interaction
   energies of a set of amino acid side chain model compounds. Furthermore,
   parameters obtained in gas phase are substantiated in liquid-phase
   simulations. The hydration free energy (HFE) of neutral and charged
   molecules have been calculated and compared with experimental values.
   The RMS error for the HFE of neutral molecules is less than 1 kcal/mol.
   Meanwhile, the relative error in the predicted HFE of salts (cations and
   anions) is less than 3\% with a correlation coefficient of 0.95.
   Overall, the performance of Poltype is satisfactory and provides a
   convenient utility for applications such as drug discovery. Further
   improvement can be achieved by the systematic study of various organic
   compounds, particularly ionic molecules, and refinement and expansion of
   the parameter database.}},

Abstract = {{Porous, high surface area materials have critical roles in applications
   including catalysis, photochemistry, and energy storage. In these
   fields, researchers have demonstrated that the nanometer-scale structure
   modifies mechanical, optical, and electrical properties of the material,
   greatly influencing its behavior and performance.
   Such complex chemical systems can involve several distinct processes
   occurring in series or parallel. Understanding the influence of size and
   structure on the properties of these materials requires techniques for
   producing clean, simple model systems. In the fields of
   photoelectrochemistry and lithium storage, for example, researchers need
   to evaluate the effects of changing the electrode structure of a single
   material or producing electrodes of many different candidate materials
   while maintaining a distinctly favorable morphology.
   In this Account, we introduce our studies of the formation and
   characterization of high surface area, porous thin films synthesized by
   a process called reactive ballistic deposition (RBD). RBD is a simple
   method that provides control of the morphology, porosity, and surface
   area of thin films by manipulating the angle at which a metal vapor flux
   impinges on the substrate during deposition. This approach is largely
   independent of the identity of the deposited material and relies upon
   limited surface diffusion during synthesis, which enables the formation
   of kinetically trapped structures.
   Here, we review our results for the deposition of films from a number of
   semiconductive materials that are important for applications such as
   photoelectrochemical water oxidation and lithium ion storage. The use of
   RBD has enabled us to systematically control individual aspects of both
   the structure and composition of thin film electrodes in order to probe
   the effects of each on the performance of the material. We have
   evaluated the performance of several materials for potential use in
   these applications and have identified processes that limit their
   performance. Use of model systems, such as these, for fundamental
   studies or materials screening processes likely will prove useful in
   developing new high-performance electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered scaffolds simultaneously exhibiting multiple cues are highly
   desirable for neural tissue regeneration. To this end, we developed a
   neural tissue engineering scaffold that displays submicrometer-scale
   features, electrical conductivity, and neurotrophic activity.
   Specifically, electrospun poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
   nanofibers were layered with a nanometer thick coating of electrically
   conducting polypyrrole (PPy) presenting carboxylic groups. Then, nerve
   growth factor (NGF) was chemically immobilized onto the surface of the
   fibers. These NGF-immobilized PPy-coated PLGA (NGF-PPyPLGA) fibers
   supported PC12 neurite formation (28.0 +/- 3.0\% of the cells) and
   neurite outgrowth (14.2 mu m median length), which were comparable to
   that observed with NGF (50 ng/mL) in culture medium (29.0 +/- 1.3\%,
   14.4 mu m). Electrical stimulation of PC12 cells on NGF-immobilized
   PPyPLGA fiber scaffolds was found to further improve neurite development
   and neurite length by 18\% and 17\%, respectively, compared to
   unstimulated cells on the NGF-immobilized fibers. Hence,
   submicrometer-scale fibrous scaffolds that incorporate neurotrophic and
   electroconducting activities may serve as promising neural tissue
   engineering scaffolds such as nerve guidance conduits.}},

Abstract = {{We report new findings on the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of
   monolayer graphene with negligible defects (>= 95\% negligible
   defect-peak over 200 mu m x 200 mu m areas) on evaporated copper films.
   Compared to copper foils used in the CVD of graphene, several new
   unexpected results have been observed including high-quality monolayer
   synthesis at temperatures <900 degrees C, a new growth window using a
   hydrogen-free methane precursor for low-defects, and electron microscope
   evidence of commensurate growth of graphene grains on underlying copper
   grains. These thermal, chemical, and physical growth characteristics of
   graphene on copper films can be attributed to the distinct differences
   in the dominant crystal orientation of copper films (111) versus foils
   (100), and consequent dissimilar interplay with the precursor gas. This
   study suggests that reduced temperature, hydrogen-free synthesis of
   defect-negligible monolayer graphene is feasible, with the potential to
   shape and scale graphene grains by controlling the size and crystal
   orientation of the underlying copper grains.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon and partially oxidized silicon thin films with nanocolumnar
   morphology were synthesized by evaporative deposition at a glancing
   angle, and their performance as lithium-ion battery anodes was
   evaluated. The incorporated oxygen concentration was controlled by
   varying the partial pressure of water during the deposition and
   monitored by quartz crystal microbalance, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. In addition to bulk oxygen content, surface oxidation and
   annealing at low temperature affected the cycling stability and
   lithium-storage capacity of the films. By simultaneously optimizing all
   three, films of similar to 2200 mAh/g capacity were synthesized. Coin
   cells made with the optimized films were reversibly cycled for similar
   to 120 cycles with virtually no capacity fade. After 300 cycles, 80\% of
   the initial reversible capacity was retained.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in fabricating shape-specific polymeric
   nano- and micropaiticles for efficient delivery of drugs and imaging
   agents. The size and shape of these particles could significantly
   Influence their transport properties and play an important role in in
   vivo biodistribution, targeting, and cellular uptake. Nanoimprint
   lithography methods, such as jet-and-flash imprint lithography (J-FIL),
   provide versatile top-down processes to fabricate shape-specific
   biocompatible nanoscale hydrogels that can deliver therapeutic and
   diagnostic molecules in response to disease-specific cues. However, the
   key challenges in top-down fabrication of such nanocarriers are scalable
   imprinting with biological and biocompatible materials, ease of
   particle-surface modification using both aqueous and organic chemistry
   as well as simple yet biocompatible harvesting. Here we report that a
   biopolymer-based sacrificial release layer in combination with improved
   nanocarrier-material formulation can address these challenges. The
   sacrificial layer improves scalability and ease of imprint-surface
   modification due to its switchable solubility through simple ion
   exchange between monovalent and divalent cations. This process enables
   large-scale bionanoimprinting and efficient, one-step harvesting of
   hydrogel nanoparticles in both water- and organic-based imprint
   solutions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{598-608}},

Abstract = {{A variational model is used to obtain the necessary gradient information
   for a multiple finite-burn trajectory problem. The augmented state
   vector includes position, velocity, mass, and control variables such as
   thrust magnitude, and the variables that describe the time evolution of
   the thrust direction unit vector. The augmented state vector and its
   associated state equation are used in the variational model to formulate
   analytical expressions for the gradients of the problem functions with
   respect to the problem variables. A general finite-burn trajectory
   problem is formulated for an inertially fixed thrust vector steering
   model and a fixed-plane linearly varying thrust vector steering model
   that constrains the thrust vector to be normal to a rotation axis, which
   itself is part of the control variable set. Both steering models are
   used in the optimization of a three-finite-burn lunar-escape-trajectory
   example, using a direct optimization method with explicit numerical
   integration. The performance of the optimization procedure is compared
   for both thrust vector steering models, using variational gradients and
   standard numerical finite difference gradients. The ability to obtain
   the most accurate gradient information for the direct optimization of
   simple finite-burn thrust steering models is a motivation of the current
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid penetration from water-based muds into shale formations results in
   swelling and subsequent wellbore instability. Particles in conventional
   drilling fluids are too large to seal the nano-sized pore throats of
   shales and to build an effective mudcake on the shale surface and reduce
   fluid invasion. This paper presents laboratory data showing the positive
   effect of adding commercially available, inexpensive, nonmodified silica
   nanoparticles (NP) (particle sizes vary from 5 to 22 nm) to water-based
   drilling muds and their effect on water invasion into shale.
   Six brands of commercial and nonmodified nanoparticles were tested and
   screened by running a three-step pressure penetration (PP) test (brine,
   base mud, nanoparticle mud). Two types of com-mon water-based muds, a
   bentonite mud and a low-solids mud (LSM), in contact with Atoka shale
   were studied with and without the addition of 10 wt\% nanoparticles. We
   found that a large reduction in shale permeability was observed when
   using the muds to which the nonmodified nanoparticles had been added.
   For the bentonite muds, the permeability of Atoka shale decreased by
   57.72 to 99.33\%, and, for the LSMs, the permeability of Atoka shale
   decreased by 45.67 to 87.63\%. Higher plastic viscosity (PV) and lower
   yield point (YP) and fluid loss (FL) of the nanoparticle muds compared
   with base muds were also observed. We also found that nanoparticles
   varying in size from 7 to 15 rim and a concentration of 10 wt\% are
   shown to be effective at reducing shale permeability, thereby reducing
   the interaction between Atoka shale and a water-based drilling fluid.
   This study shows for the first time that it is possible to formulate
   water-based muds using inexpensive nonmodified and commercially
   available silica nanoparticles and that these muds significantly reduce
   the invasion of water into the shale. The addition of silica
   nanoparticles to water-based muds may offer a powerful and economical
   solution when dealing with wellbore-stability problems in troublesome
   shale formations.}},

   enhance work process benefits rather than broader benefits to project
   outcomes. On the other hand, there is a much wider range of important

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and implementation of a decision

   system integrates historical data, market assessment, and bid
   information to aid commercial assessment and recommendation of
   suppliers. The supplier selection module uses the Aspiration Interactive
   Method (AIM) to analyze the information. Results of two selection cases

Abstract = {{Interfacial interactions between sub-4 nm metal alloy nanoparticles and
   carbon supports, although not well understood at the atomic level, may
   be expected to have a profound influence on catalytic properties. Pd3Pt2
   alloy particles comprised of a disordered surface layer over a
   corrugated crystalline core are shown to exhibit strong interfacial
   interactions with a similar to 20-50 nm spherical carbon support, as
   characterized by probe aberration corrected scanning transmission
   electron microscopy (pcSTEM). The disordered shells were formed from
   defects introduced by Pd during arrested growth synthesis of the alloy
   nanoparticles. The chemical and morphological changes in the catalyst,
   before and after cyclic stability testing (1000 cycles, 0.5-1.2V). were
   probed with cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pcSTEM. The strong metal-support
   interaction, along with the uniform alloy structure raised the mass

   interactions also mitigated nanoparticle coalescence, dissolution, and
   ripening, resulting in only a 20\% loss in mass activity (versus 60\%

   alloy structure, guided by insight from atomic scale pcSTEM, for
   enhanced catalytic activity and stability, resulting from strong wetting
   with a deformable disordered shell, has the potential to be a general

Abstract = {{Within a knowledge-based multiscale simulation approach for
   ferroelectric materials, the atomic level can be linked to the mesoscale
   by transferring results from first-principles calculations into a
   phase-field model. A recently presented routine (Volker et al 2011
   Contin. Mech. Thermodyn. 23 435-51) for adjusting the Helmholtz free
   energy coefficients to intrinsic and extrinsic ferroelectric material
   properties obtained by DFT calculations and atomistic simulations was
   subject to certain limitations: caused by too small available degrees of
   freedom, an independent adjustment of the spontaneous strains and
   piezoelectric coefficients was not possible, and the elastic properties
   could only be considered in cubic instead of tetragonal symmetry. In
   this work we overcome such restrictions by expanding the formulation of
   the free energy function, i.e. by motivating and introducing new
   higher-order terms that have not appeared in the literature before.
   Subsequently we present an improved version of the adjustment procedure
   for the free energy coefficients that is solely based on input
   parameters from first-principles calculations performed by Marton and
   Elsasser, as documented in Volker et al (2011 Contin. Mech. Thermodyn.
   23 435-51). Full sets of adjusted free energy coefficients for PbTiO3
   and tetragonal Pb(Zr, Ti)O-3 are presented, and the benefits of the
   newly introduced higher-order free energy terms are discussed.}},

   cracks was shown to have a direct adverse effect on specimen
   performance, and local areas of severe corrosion were found on

Abstract = {{Many discrete choice contexts in transportation deal with large choice
   sets, including destination, route, and vehicle choices. Model
   estimation with large numbers of alternatives remains computationally
   expensive. In the context of the multinomial logit (MNL) model, limiting
   the number of alternatives in estimation by simple random sampling (SRS)
   yields consistent parameter estimates, but estimator efficiency suffers.
   In the context of more general models, such as the mixed MNL, limiting
   the number of alternatives via SRS yields biased parameter estimates. In
   this paper, a new, strategic sampling scheme is introduced, which draws
   alternatives in proportion to updated choice-probability estimates.
   Since such probabilities are not known a priori, the first iteration
   uses SRS among all available alternatives. The sampling scheme is
   implemented here for a variety of simulated MNL and mixed-MNL data sets,
   with results suggesting that the new sampling scheme provides
   substantial efficiency benefits. Thanks to reductions in estimation
   error, parameter estimates are more accurate, on average. Moreover, in
   the mixed MNL case, where SRS produces biased estimates (due to
   violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property), the
   new sampling scheme appears to effectively eliminate such biases.
   Finally, it appears that only a single iteration of the new strategy
   (following the initialization step using SRS) is needed to deliver the
   strategy's maximum efficiency gains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Significant cost overruns and schedule delays on oil and gas projects in
   Alberta have been of great concern for many companies. The industry has
   indicated a need for public data to verify anecdotal conclusions that
   labor productivity is the root cause behind project performance
   problems. In this paper, a sample of 37 Alberta oil and gas projects was
   analyzed. The findings provided evidence that poor planning and
   inadequate project scope definition gave rise to project cost and
   schedule performance problems, while labor productivity is merely a
   proximate cause. High correlations are revealed between deficient
   project performance and factors such as low percent engineering
   completed before construction start, low estimation accuracy of field
   productivity rates, unit costs, crew sizes, and indirect costs. The
   results also emphasized a need to increase the level of implementation
   of best management practices to ameliorate the effects of the

Abstract = {{Interference between nodes is a critical impairment in mobile ad hoc
   networks. This paper studies the role of multiple antennas in mitigating
   such interference. Specifically, a network is studied in which receivers
   apply zero-forcing beamforming to cancel the strongest interferers.
   Assuming a network with Poisson-distributed transmitters and independent
   Rayleigh fading channels, the transmission capacity is derived, which
   gives the maximum number of successful transmissions per unit area.
   Mathematical tools from stochastic geometry are applied to obtain the
   asymptotic transmission capacity scaling and characterize the impact of
   inaccurate channel state information (CSI). It is shown that, if each
   node cancels L interferers, the transmission capacity decreases as Theta
   (1/epsilon(L+1))as the outage probability epsilon vanishes. For fixed
   epsilon, as L grows, the transmission capacity increases as Theta
   (L1-2/alpha) where alpha is the path-loss exponent. Moreover, CSI
   inaccuracy is shown to have no effect on the transmission capacity
   scaling as epsilon vanishes, provided that the CSI training sequence has
   an appropriate length, which we derive. Numerical results suggest that
   canceling merely one interferer by each node may increase the
   transmission capacity by an order of magnitude or more, even when the
   CSI is imperfect.}},

   limited by an average power constraint. In this paper, a lattice coding
   scheme and two lower bounds on the achievable distortion are presented.
   The lattice scheme achieves within a constant of a distortion lower
   bound if the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than a threshold.
   Furthermore, for the difference of correlated Gaussian sources, uncoded
   transmission is shown to be worse in performance to lattice coding
   methods for correlation coefficients above a threshold.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophilic silica (SiO2) nanoparticles (average size = 7 nm), which act
   as inorganic acids at low pH (<2), were added together with a
   PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer dispersant to a random disulfonated
   poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymer in the potassium salt (-SO3
   K--(+)) form in order to control permeation and rejection
   characteristics of the homopolymer. The dispersants (shell) absorbed on
   the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles (core) formed a distinctive core-shell
   structure. The PEO units located at the outside of the dispersant formed
   complexes with -SO3 K--(+) groups of BPS-20 via ion-dipole interactions.
   These interactions induced a compatible binary system following the
   Flory-Fox equation associated with glass transition temperature (T-g)
   depression and prevented extraction of the water-soluble dispersant even
   under aqueous conditions. The ion-dipole interaction, combined with
   hydrogen bonding between SiO2 and the dispersant, caused SiO2
   nanoparticles to be well distributed within the BPS-20 matrix up to a
   limit of 1 wt.\% of SiO2 and minimized the formation of non-selective
   cavities within the matrix's hydrophilic water channels. The resulting
   BPS-20\_SiO2 nanocomposites showed improved salt rejection and reduced
   ionic conductivity. These trends are analogous to those of disulfonated
   copolymer systems, with polar groups creating hydrogen bonding or
   acid-base complexation with -SO3 K--(+) groups in BPS copolymers. Well
   dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles in highly water-permeable desalination
   membranes are expected to result in an increase in salt rejection but
   very little change in water permeability. The addition of nanoparticles
   to desalination membranes may offset the permeability-selectivity
   tradeoff observed in polymer membranes. Above 1 wt.\%, SiO2
   nanoparticles increased both the interchain distance between polymer
   chains and the water uptake. However, the increased hydrophilicity due
   to high SiO2 content did not yield improved water permeation of the
   nanocomposite membranes. The SiO2 nanoparticles acted as barriers,
   hindering water passage (restrictive diffusion) and lowering water
   permeability. Meanwhile, acidic hydroxyl groups (OH2+) on the SiO2
   surface in the sulfonate matrix led to improved ionic conductivity, but
   NaCl rejection capability decreased because the concentration of -SO3
   K--(+) was diluted by highly absorbed water molecules, resulting in
   weakened Donnan exclusion. The mechanical properties and chlorine
   resistance of all BPS-20\_SiO2 nanocomposites were comparable to those
   of BPS-20. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance under simulated
   solar irradiation of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) films synthesized by
   coevaporation of pure Si and Fe in an oxygen ambient, a process known as
   reactive ballistic deposition, is studied as a function of Si doping
   level and film porosity, ranging from dense films to nanocolumnar films.
   It is found that Si segregates to the hematite surface, does not improve
   the bulk conductivity, and lowers the optical absorption coefficient.
   Nevertheless, the photoelectrochemical performance of Si-doped, porous
   films is significantly improved relative to undoped, porous films.
   However, the improvement relative to dense, undoped films is marginal.
   It is concluded that Si acts to passivate the hematite surface and aids
   charge transfer to the solution. Additionally, from incident photon
   conversion efficiency measurements it is found that Si doping and
   porosity have little effect on the normalized spectral response of 100
   nm thick hematite films.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In addition to its exotic electronic properties(1,2) graphene exhibits
   unusually high intrinsic thermal conductivity(3-6). The physics of
   phonons-the main heat carriers in graphene-has been shown to be
   substantially different in two-dimensional (2D) crystals, such as
   graphene, from in three-dimensional (3D) graphite(7-10). Here, we report
   our experimental study of the isotope effects on the thermal properties
   of graphene. Isotopically modified graphene containing various
   percentages of C-13 were synthesized by chemical vapour deposition
   (CVD). The regions of different isotopic compositions were parts of the
   same graphene sheet to ensure uniformity in material parameters. The
   thermal conductivity, K, of isotopically pure C-12 (0.01\% C-13)
   graphene determined by the optothermal Raman technique(3-7,10), was
   higher than 4,000 W mK(-1) at the measured temperature T-m similar to
   320 K, and more than a factor of two higher than the value of K in
   graphene sheets composed of a 50:50 mixture of C-12 and C-13. The
   experimental data agree well with our molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations, corrected for the long-wavelength phonon contributions by
   means of the Klemens model. The experimental results are expected to
   stimulate further studies aimed at a better understanding of thermal
   phenomena in 2D crystals.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of radiofrequency electronic methodologies on micro-as
   well as nanoscale platforms is crucial for information processing and
   data-storage technologies(1-3). In electronics, radiofrequency signals
   are controlled and manipulated by `lumped' circuit elements, such as
   resistors, inductors and capacitors. In earlier work(4,5), we
   theoretically proposed that optical nanostructures, when properly
   designed and judiciously arranged, could behave as nanoscale lumped
   circuit elements-but at optical frequencies. Here, for the first time we
   experimentally demonstrate a two-dimensional optical nanocircuit at
   mid-infrared wavelengths. With the guidance of circuit theory, we design
   and fabricate arrays of Si3N4 nanorods with specific deep subwavelength
   cross-sections, quantitatively evaluate their equivalent impedance as
   lumped circuit elements in the mid-infrared regime, and by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy show that these nanostructures can
   indeed function as two-dimensional optical lumped circuit elements. We
   further show that the connections among nanocircuit elements, in
   particular whether they are in series or in parallel combination, can be
   controlled by the polarization of impinging optical signals, realizing
   the notion of `stereo-circuitry' in metatronics-metamaterials-inspired
   optical circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a technique is presented for selecting signals to observe
   during silicon debug. Internal signals are used to analyze, understand,
   and debug circuit misbehavior. An automated procedure to select which
   signals to observe is proposed to facilitate early detection of circuit
   malfunction and to enhance the utilization of hardware resources for
   storage. Signals that are most often sensitized to possible errors are
   observed in sequential circuits. Given a functional input vector set, an
   error transmission matrix is generated by analyzing which flip-flops are
   sensitized to other flip-flops. Relatively independent flip-flops are
   identified and a set of signals that maximally cover the possible error
   sites with given constraints are identified through integer linear
   programming. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can
   rapidly and precisely identify the nonconforming chip behavior and
   thereby can speed up the post-silicon debug process.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Optimization of full-scale, biological perchlorate treatment
   processes for drinking water would benefit from knowledge of the
   location and quantity of perchlorate-reducing bacteria (PRB) and
   expression of perchlorate-related genes in bioreactors. The aim of this
   study was to quantify perchlorate removal and perchlorate-related genes
   (pcrA and cld) and their transcripts in bioreactors and to determine
   whether these genes or transcripts could serve as useful biomarkers for
   perchlorate treatment processes.
   Methods and Results: Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeting pcrA and
   cld were applied to two pilot-scale, fixed-bed bioreactors treating
   perchlorate-contaminated groundwater. pcrA and cld genes per microgram
   of DNA were two- to threefold higher and three-to fourfold higher,
   respectively, in the bioreactor showing superior perchlorate-removal
   performance. In a laboratory-scale bioreactor, quantities of pcrA and
   cld genes and transcripts were compared under two distinct performance
   conditions (c. 60 and 20\% perchlorate removal) for a 5-min empty bed
   contact time. cld genes per microgram of DNA were approximately
   threefold higher and cld transcripts per microgram of RNA were
   approximately sixfold higher under the higher perchlorate-removal
   condition. No differences in pcrA genes or transcripts per microgram of
   DNA or RNA, respectively, were detected between the c. 60 and 20\%
   perchlorate-removal conditions, possibly because these assays did not
   accurately quantify pcrA genes and transcripts in the mixed culture
   present.
   Conclusions: Quantities of cld genes and transcripts per microgram of
   DNA and RNA, respectively, were found to be higher when perchlorate
   removal was higher. However, quantities of pcrA and cld genes or
   transcripts were not found to directly correlate with
   perchlorate-removal rates.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: To our knowledge, this study
   represents the first application of qPCR assays to quantify
   perchlorate-related genes and transcripts in continuous-flow
   bioreactors. The results indicate that cld gene and transcript
   quantities can provide insights regarding the quantity, location and
   gene expression of PRB in bioreactors.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of four conditioning procedures, i.e. methanol circulation,
   combination of methanol circulation and electric load, methanol
   circulation plus gas evolution, and H-2/O-2 PEMFC mode, on the
   electrochemical behaviors and performances of membrane-electrode
   assemblies (MEAs) in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been
   comparatively investigated for maximizing their performances. The
   results show that the conditioning procedures do not have much influence
   on the catalytic activity, oxygen transport, and proton resistance in
   the catalyst layer. However, the conditioning procedures have
   significant influence on the hydration of the MEAs, which determines the
   electrochemical performances of the MEAs before eventually reaching
   their maximum performances. Among the various procedures investigated,
   the combination of methanol circulation and electric load is a
   convenient and effective in situ way to activate the fresh MEAs in DMFC,
   which speeds up the hydration of the MEAs due to large amount of water
   on both electrodes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Channel shortening equalizers are used in acoustics to reduce
   reverberation, in error control decoding to reduce complexity, and in
   communication receivers to reduce inter-symbol interference. The cascade
   of a channel and channel shortening equalizer ideally produces an
   overall impulse response that has most of its energy compacted into
   fewer adjacent samples. Once designed, channel shortening equalizers
   filter the received signal on a per-sample basis and need to be adapted
   or re-designed if the channel impulse response changes significantly. In
   this paper, we evaluate sparse filters as channel shortening equalizers.
   Unlike conventional dense filters, sparse filters have a small number of
   non-contiguous non-zero coefficients. Our contributions include (1)
   proposing optimal and sub-optimal low complexity algorithms for sparse
   shortening filter design, and (2) evaluating impulse response energy
   compaction vs. design and implementation stage computational complexity
   tradeoffs for the proposed algorithms. We apply the proposed equalizer
   design procedures to (1) asymmetric digital subscriber line channels and
   (2) underwater acoustic communication channels. Our simulation results
   utilize measured channel impulse responses and show that sparse filters
   are able to achieve the same channel energy compaction with half as many
   coefficients as dense filters.}},

Title = {{Optimal Power Settings for Holmium:YAG Lithotripsy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{914-919}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: We determined the optimal Ho:YAG lithotripsy power settings to
   achieve maximal fragmentation, minimal fragment size and minimal
   retropulsion.
   Materials and Methods: Stone phantoms were irradiated in water with a
   Ho: YAG laser using a 365 inn optical-fiber. Six distinct power settings
   were tested, including 0.2 to 2.0 J and 10 to 40 Hz. For all cohorts 500
   J total radiant energy were delivered. A seventh cohort (0.2 J 40 Hz)
   was tested post hoc to a total energy of 1,250 J. Two experimental
   conditions were tested, including with and without phantom
   stabilization. Total fragmentation, fragment size and retropulsion were
   characterized. In mechanism experiments using human calculi we measured
   crater volume by optical coherence tomography and pressure transients by
   needle hydrophone across similar power settings.
   Results: Without stabilization increased pulse energy settings produced
   increased total fragmentation and increased retropulsion (each p
   <0.0001). Fragment size was smallest for the 0.2 J cohorts (p <0.02).
   With stabilization increased pulse energy settings produced increased
   total fragmentation and increased retropulsion but also increased
   fragment size (each p <0.0001). Craters remained symmetrical and volume
   increased as pulse energy increased. Pressure transients remained modest
   at less than 30 bars even at 2.0 J pulse energy.
   Conclusions: Holmium:YAG lithotripsy varies as pulse energy settings
   vary. At low pulse energy (0.2 J) less fragmentation and retropulsion
   occur and small fragments are produced. At high pulse energy (2.0 J)
   more fragmentation and retropulsion occur with larger fragments.
   Anti-retropulsion devices produce more efficient lithotripsy,
   particularly at high pulse energy. Optimal lithotripsy laser dosimetry
   depends on the desired outcome.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{321-349}},

Abstract = {{As leisure travel continues to grow, it has become a critical subject
   for planners and decision-makers since it significantly impacts regional
   economic and social development as well as contributes to emission
   levels and congestion. Despite being a significant percentage of our
   travel, however, leisure travel behavior is still not very well
   understood. The goal of this article is to contribute to our
   understanding of leisure activity participation by considering leisure
   activity loyalty within the travel context. In particular, this study
   focuses on one specific dimension of travel context: travel extent
   (i.e., whether an individual participates in a leisure activity on a
   daily versus a long-distance basis). As such, this article first
   introduces a unified conceptual framework for measuring leisure activity
   loyalties within a travel context, based on two distinct dynamics of
   leisure loyalty behavior-destination attachment and activity
   involvement. Additionally, this article uses a unique 2001 NHTS dataset
   comprised of households' daily and long-distance leisure activities to
   undertake a unique empirical analysis of five distinct leisure
   activities using the conceptual framework and a copula-based model
   methodology. The findings confirmed that households demonstrate
   significant loyalties to travel contexts across all leisure activities,
   especially resting and sightseeing.}},

Abstract = {{Solving the Kohn-Sham equation, which arises in density functional
   theory, is a standard procedure to determine the electronic structure of
   atoms, molecules, and condensed matter systems. The solution of this
   nonlinear eigenproblem is used to predict the spatial and energetic
   distribution of electronic states. However, obtaining a solution for
   large systems is computationally intensive because the problem scales
   super-linearly with the number of atoms. Here we demonstrate a divide
   and conquer method that partitions the necessary eigenvalue spectrum
   into slices and computes each partial spectrum on an independent group
   of processors in parallel. We focus on the elements of the spectrum
   slicing method that are essential to its correctness and robustness such
   as the choice of filter polynomial, the stopping criterion for a vector
   iteration, and the detection of duplicate eigenpairs computed in
   adjacent spectral slices. Some of the more prominent aspects of
   developing an optimized implementation are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{Spatial and Temporal Model of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{394-403}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a spatial and temporal model of electric vehicle
   charging demand for a rapid charging station located near a highway
   exit. Most previous studies have assumed a fixed charging location and
   fixed charging time during the off-peak hours for anticipating electric
   vehicle charging demand. Some other studies have based on limited
   charging scenarios at typical locations instead of a mathematical model.
   Therefore, from a distribution system perspective, electric vehicle
   charging demand is still unidentified quantity which may vary by space
   and time. In this context, this study proposes a mathematical model of
   electric vehicle charging demand for a rapid charging station. The
   mathematical model is based on the fluid dynamic traffic model and the
   M/M/s queueing theory. Firstly, the arrival rate of discharged vehicles
   at a charging station is predicted by the fluid dynamic model. Then,
   charging demand is forecasted by the M/M/s queueing theory with the
   arrival rate of discharged vehicles. This mathematical model of charging
   demand may allow grid's distribution planners to anticipate a charging

Abstract = {{Over the past decade key technologies have progressed so that
   mass-market viable plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are now set to reach
   the first of many major vehicle markets by 2011. PEV-grid interactions
   comprise a mix of industries that have not interacted closely in the
   past. A number of these commercial participants have utilized the same
   basic business model for nearly a century. The various participants
   include vehicle manufacturers, utilities, and supplier firms who have
   radically different business models, regulatory and legal environments,
   geographical scope, and technical capabilities. This paper will provide
   a survey of PEV technology trends and other factors. From an analysis of
   these factors this paper synthesizes and provides a likely scenario for
   PEV-grid interaction over the next decade.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput methods systematically measure the internal state of the
   entire cell, but powerful computational tools are needed to infer
   dynamics from their raw data. Therefore, we have developed a new
   computational method, Eigen-genomic System Dynamic-pattern Analysis
   (ESDA), which uses systems theory to infer dynamic parameters from a
   time series of gene expression measurements. As many genes are measured
   at a modest number of time points, estimation of the system matrix is
   underdetermined and traditional approaches for estimating dynamic
   parameters are ineffective; thus, ESDA uses the principle of
   dimensionality reduction to overcome the data imbalance. Since
   degradation rates are naturally confounded by self-regulation, our model
   estimates an effective degradation rate that is the difference between
   self-regulation and degradation. We demonstrate that ESDA is able to
   recover effective degradation rates with reasonable accuracy in
   simulation. We also apply ESDA to a budding yeast data set, and find
   that effective degradation rates are normally slower than experimentally
   measured degradation rates. Our results suggest that either
   self-regulation is widespread in budding yeast and that self-promotion
   dominates self-inhibition, or that self-regulation may be rare and that
   experimental methods for measuring degradation rates based on
   transcription arrest may severely overestimate true degradation rates in
   healthy cells.}},

Abstract = {{Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are distinguished from one another by their
   unique device geometries, reflecting their distinct drug detachment
   mechanisms, which can be broadly classified into either aerodynamic or
   mechanical-based detachment forces. Accordingly, powder particles
   experience different aerodynamic and mechanical forces depending on the
   inhaler. However, the influence of carrier particle physical properties
   on the performance of DPIs with different dispersion mechanisms remains
   largely unexplored. Carrier particle trajectories through two commercial
   DPIs were modeled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the
   results were compared with in vitro aerosol studies to assess the role
   of carrier particle size and shape on inhaler performance. Two percent
   (w/w) binary blends of budesonide with anhydrous and granulated lactose
   carriers ranging up to 300 mu m were dispersed from both an Aerolizer
   (R) and Handihaler (R) through a cascade impactor at 60 L min-1. For the
   simulations, carrier particles were modeled as spherical monodisperse
   populations with small (32 mu m), medium (108 mu m), and large (275 mu
   m) particle diameters. CFD simulations revealed the average number of
   carrier particleinhaler collisions increased with carrier particle size
   (2.34.0) in the Aerolizer (R), reflecting the improved performance
   observed in vitro. Collisions within the Handihaler (R), in contrast,
   were less frequent and generally independent of carrier particle size.
   The results demonstrate that the aerodynamic behavior of carrier
   particles varies markedly with both their physical properties and the
   inhalation device, significantly influencing the performance of a dry
   powder inhaler formulation. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the

Abstract = {{Background and motivation: The structure, composition and mechanics of
   carotid artery are good indicators of early progressive atherosclerotic
   lesions. The combination of three imaging modalities (ultrasound, strain
   rate and photoacoustic imaging) which could provide corroborative
   information about the named arterial properties could enhance the
   characterization of intimal xanthoma.
   Methods: The experiments were performed using a New Zealand white rabbit
   model of atherosclerosis. The aorta excised from an atherosclerotic
   rabbit was scanned ex vivo using the three imaging techniques: (1)
   ultrasound imaging of the longitudinal section: standard ultrasound
   B-mode (74 Hz frame rate); (2) strain rate imaging: the artery was
   flushed with blood and a 1.5 Hz physiologic pulsation was induced, while
   the ultrasound data were recorded at higher frame rate (296 Hz); (3)
   photoacoustic imaging: the artery was irradiated with nanosecond pulsed
   laser light of low fluence in the 1210-1230 nm wavelength range and the
   photoacoustic data was recorded at 10 Hz frame rate. Post processing
   algorithms based on cross-correlation and optical absorption variation
   were implemented to derive strain rate and spectroscopic photoacoustic
   images, respectively.
   Results: Based on the spatio-temporal variation in displacement of
   different regions within the arterial wall, strain rate imaging reveals
   differences in tissue mechanical properties. Additionally, spectroscopic
   photoacoustic imaging can spatially resolve the optical absorption
   properties of arterial tissue and identify the location of lipid pools.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates that ultrasound, strain rate and
   photoacoustic imaging can be used to simultaneously evaluate the
   structure, the mechanics and the composition of atherosclerotic lesions
   to improve the assessment of plaque vulnerability. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Systemic L-arginine depletion following intravenous administration of
   L-arginine hydrolyzing enzymes has been shown to selectively impact
   tumors displaying urea cycle defects including a large fraction of
   hepatocellular carcinomas, metastatic melanomas and small cell lung
   carcinomas. However, the human arginases display poor serum stability
   (t(1/2) = 4.8 h) whereas a bacterial arginine deiminase evaluated in
   phase II clinical trials was reported to be immunogenic, eliciting
   strong neutralizing antibody responses. Recently, we showed that
   substitution of the Mn2+ metal center in human Arginase I with Co2+
   (Co-hArgI) results in an enzyme that displays 10-fold higher catalytic
   efficiency for L-Arg hydrolysis, 12-15 fold reduction in the IC50
   towards a variety of malignant cell lines and, importantly a t(1/2) = 22
   h in serum. To investigate the utility of Co-hArgI for L-Arg depletion
   therapy in cancer we systematically investigated three strategies for
   enhancing the persistence of the enzyme in circulation: (i) site
   specific conjugation of Co-hArgI engineered with an accessible
   N-terminal Cys residue to 20 kDa PEG-maleimide (Co-hArgI-CPEG-20K); (ii)
   engineering of the homotrimeric Co-hArgI into a linked, monomeric 110
   kDa polypeptide (Co-hArgI x3) and (iii) lysyl conjugation of 5 kDa
   PEG-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester (Co-hArgI-KPEG-5K). Surprisingly,
   even though all three formulations resulted in proteins with a predicted
   hydrodynamic radius larger than the cut-off for renal filtration, only
   Co-hArgI amine conjugated to 5 kDa PEG remained in circulation for
   sufficiently long durations. Using Co-hArgI-KPEG-5K labeled with an
   end-terminal fluorescein for easy detection, we demonstrated that
   following intraperitoneal administration at 6 mg/kg weight, a well
   tolerated dose, the circulation t(1/2) of the protein in Balb/c mice is
   63 +/- 10 h. Very low levels of serum L-Arg ( < 5 mu M) could be
   sustained for over 75 h after injection, representing a 9-fold increase
   in pharmacodynamic efficacy relative to similarly prepared
   Mn2+-containing hArgI conjugated to 5 kDa PEG-NHS ester
   (Mn-hArgI-KPEG-5K). The favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
   properties of Co- hArgI-KPEG-5K reported here, coupled with its human
   origin which should reduce the likelihood of adverse immune responses,
   make it a promising candidate for cancer therapy. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Spall strength was measured as a function of composition and
   microstructure in three Al materials: a high-purity Al (AlHP), a
   commercial-purity Al (AA1100) and an alloy of Al containing 3 wt.\% Mg
   (Al-3Mg). The Al HP and AA1100 materials were tested as single-crystal
   sheets, and the Al-3Mg alloy was tested as polycrystalline sheets having
   a variety of controlled grain sizes. A high-intensity laser produced
   shock loadings to create tensile strain rates ranging from 2 x 10(6)
   s(-1) to 5 x 10(6) s(-1), which caused spall fracture. Crystallographic
   orientation, relative to the direction of shock propagation, does not

   damage during tensile shock loading and reduce spall strength of the
   AA1100 material below that of the Al-HP material. The spall strength of
   the Al-3Mg is lowest among the three materials, and this is a result of
   the decreased ductility during spall fracture caused by the Mg
   solid-solution alloying addition. Grain size affects fracture character
   of the Al-3Mg material, but does not discernibly affect spall strength;
   the fraction of ductile transgranular fracture, versus brittle
   intergranular fracture, increases with grain size. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{RNA molecules play critical roles in many cellular processes.
   Traditionally viewed as genetic messengers, RNA molecules were recently
   discovered to have diverse functions related to gene regulation and
   expression. RNA also has great potential as a therapeutic and a tool for
   further investigation of gene regulation. Metal ions are an integral
   part of RNA structure and should be considered in any experimental or
   theoretical study of RNA. Here, we report a multidisciplinary approach
   that combines anomalous small-angle x-ray scattering and
   molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations with explicit solvent and ions
   around RNA. From experiment and simulation results, we find excellent
   agreement in the number and distribution of excess monovalent and
   divalent ions around a short RNA duplex. Although similar agreement can
   be obtained from a continuum description of the solvent and mobile ions
   (by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and accounting for finite ion
   size), the use of MD is easily extended to flexible RNA systems with
   thermal fluctuations. Therefore, we also model a short RNA pseudoknot
   and find good agreement between the MD results and the experimentally
   derived solution structures. Surprisingly, both deviate from crystal
   structure predictions. These favorable comparisons of experiment and
   simulations encourage work on RNA in all-atom dynamic models.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of different cations around A-RNA are computed by
   Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation and replica exchange molecular dynamics
   (MD). Both the nonlinear PB and size-modified PB theories are
   considered. The number of ions bound to A-RNA, which can be measured
   experimentally, is well reproduced in all methods. On the other hand,
   the radial ion distribution profiles show differences between MD and PB.
   We showed that PB results are sensitive to ion size and functional form
   of the solvent dielectric region but not the solvent dielectric boundary
   definition. Size-modified PB agrees with replica exchange molecular
   dynamics much better than nonlinear PB when the ion sizes are chosen
   from atomistic simulations. The distribution of ions 14 angstrom away
   from the RNA central axis are reasonably well reproduced by
   size-modified PB for all ion types with a uniform solvent dielectric
   model and a sharp dielectric boundary between solvent and RNA. However,
   this model does not agree with MD for shorter distances from the A-RNA.
   A distance-dependent solvent dielectric function proposed by another
   research group improves the agreement for sodium and strontium ions,
   even for shorter distances from the A-RNA. However, Mg2+ distributions
   are still at significant variances for shorter distances.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an affordable low-noise surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
   instrument based on extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) in metallic
   nanohole arrays and quantify a broad range of antibody-ligand binding
   kinetics with equilibrium dissociation constants ranging from 200 pM to
   40 nM. This nanohole-based SPR instrument is straightforward to
   construct, align, and operate, since it is built around a standard
   microscope and a portable fiber-optic spectrometer. The measured
   refractive index resolution of this platform is 3.1 x 10(-6) without
   on-chip cooling, which is among the lowest reported for SPR sensors
   based on EOT. This is accomplished via rapid full-spectrum acquisition
   in 10 ms followed by frame averaging of the EOT spectra, which is made
   possible by the production of template-stripped gold nanohole arrays
   with homogeneous optical properties over centimeter-sized areas.
   Sequential SPR measurements are performed using a 12-channel
   microfluidic flow cell after optimizing surface modification protocols
   and antibody injection conditions to minimize mass-transport artifacts.
   The immobilization of a model ligand, the protective antigen of anthrax
   on the gold surface, is monitored in real-time with a signal-to-noise
   ratio of similar to 860. Subsequently, real-time binding kinetic curves
   were measured quantitatively between the antigen and a panel of small,
   25 kDa single-chain antibodies at concentrations down to 1 nM. These
   results indicate that nanohole-based SPR instruments have potential for
   quantitative antibody screening and as a general-purpose platform for
   integrating SPR sensors with other bioanalytical tools.}},

   conductance G is proposed to explain the measured ``on{''} state
   capacitances under frequency ranges from 1 KHz to 1 MHz. The
   electrochemical redox process is adopted to explain the formation of Si
   filament during electroforming and switching. ``On{''} and ``off{''}
   currents were also measured at various operating temperatures. It is
   found that both set and reset voltages increase as temperature decreases
   and that no electroforming is exhibited at low temperature T-77 K. (C)

   single crystal SrTiO3 substrate at high deposition temperatures. It also
   has a lattice matching relation between the PBCO and GDC vertical
   nanocolumns. The symmetric cells with the VAN interlayer are found to
   have a lower area specific resistance (ASR) of 2.1 Q cm2 compared to
   that of the ones without the interlayer (2.5 Omega cm(2)) at 400 C. The

Abstract = {{Directed evolution relies on both random and site-directed mutagenesis
   of individual genes and regulatory elements to create variants with
   altered activity profiles for engineering applications. Central to these
   experiments is the construction of large libraries of related variants.
   However, a number of technical hurdles continue to limit routine
   construction of random mutagenesis libraries in Escherichia coli, in
   particular, inefficiencies during digestion and ligation steps. Here, we
   report a restriction enzyme-free approach to library generation using
   megaprimers termed MegAnneal. Target DNA is first exponentially
   amplified using error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then
   linearly amplified with a single 3' primer to generate long, randomly
   mutated, single-stranded megaprimers. These are annealed to
   single-stranded dUTP-containing template plasmid and extended with 17
   polymerase to create a complementary strand, and the resulting termini
   are ligated with 14 DNA ligase. Using this approach, we are able to
   reliably generate libraries of approximately 10(7) colony-forming units
   (cfu)/mu g DNA/transformation in a single day. We have created MegAnneal
   libraries based on three different single-chain antibodies and
   identified variants with enhanced expression and ligand-binding
   affinity. The key advantages of this approach include facile
   amplification, restriction enzyme-free library generation, and a
   significantly reduced risk of mutations outside the targeted region and
   wild-type contamination as compared with current methods. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The mechanisms that govern the transport of colloids in the unsaturated
   zone of soils are still poorly understood, because of the complexity of
   processes that occur at pore scale. These mechanisms are of specific
   interest in quantifying water quality with respect to pathogen transport
   (e.g. Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium) between the source (e.g. farms)
   and human users. Besides straining in pore throats and constrictions of
   smaller or equivalent size, the colloids can be retained at the
   interfaces between air, water, and grains. Theories competing to explain
   this mechanism claim that retention can be caused by adhesion at the
   air-water-interface (AWI) between sediment grains or by straining at the
   air-water-solid (AWS) contact line. Currently, there are no established
   methods for the estimation of pathogen retention in unsaturated media
   because of the intricate influence of AWI and AWS on transport and
   retention. What is known is that the geometric configuration and
   connectivity of the aqueous phase is an important factor in unsaturated
   transport. In this work we develop a computational method based on level
   set functions to identify and quantify the AWS contact line (in general
   the non-wetting-wetting-solid contact line) in any porous material. This
   is the first comprehensive report on contact line measurement for fluid
   configurations from both level-set method based fluid displacement
   simulation and imaged experiments. The method is applicable to any type
   of porous system, as long as the detailed pore scale geometry is
   available. We calculated the contact line length in model sediments
   (packs of spheres) as well as in real porous media, whose geometry is
   taken from high-resolution images of glass bead packs and sedimentary
   rocks. We observed a strong dependence of contact line length on the
   geometry of the sediment grains and the arrangement of the air and water
   phases. These measurements can help determine the relative contribution
   of the AWS line to pathogen retention. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Tantalum cobalt nitride photocatalysts were prepared using a simple drop
   coating method on a Ta foil substrate followed by thermal ammonia
   treatment, and their photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties for water
   oxidation under visible light were studied. The resulting Ta0.9Co0.1Nx
   films showed a photocurrent of ca. 1.5 mA/cm(2) (12 times higher than
   that of Ta3N5) under 100 mW/cm(2) visible light irradiation at 0.7 V vs
   Ag/AgCl in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH 11). The good PEC
   performance was attributed to the introduction of cobalt and the
   formation of cobalt nitride, which efficiently facilitates electron
   transfer and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated
   electron-hole pairs. Some cobalt nitride could further be oxidized to
   generate cobalt oxide, which serves as an efficient electrocatalyst for
   water oxidation. The enhanced visible light activity and film stability
   under light irradiation make tantalum cobalt nitride a promising
   semiconductor for PEC water oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{The unique structural characteristics and their effect on the

   system xLi{[}Li0.2Mn0.6Ni0.17Co0.03]O-2-(1 -
   x)Li{[}Mn1.5Ni0.425Co0.075]O-4 (0 <= x <= 1) have been investigated by a
   systematic analysis of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, neutron
   diffraction data (ND), electrochemical charge-discharge profiles, and
   electrochemical differential-capacity measurements. In the 0.5 <= x < 1
   samples, the capacity and energy density of the composite cathodes
   gradually increase during 50 cycles with a change in the shape of the
   charge-discharge profiles. Ex situ X-ray diffraction data reveal two
   important findings, which account for the superior cycle performance:
   (i) the layered phase in the composite cathodes (x = 0.5 and 0.75)
   undergoes an irreversible phase transformation to a cubic spinet phase
   during extended electrochemical cycling, and the newly formed spinel
   phase exhibits only a 3 V plateau without any 4 or 4.7 V plateau as both
   Mn and Ni are present in the 4+ state; (ii) the parent 5 V cubic spinel
   phase undergoes a cubic to tetragonal transition during discharge, but
   the volume change is small (similar to 5\%) for the x = 0.5 and 0.75
   compositions. Both the small volume change associated with the cubic to
   tetragonal transition and the excellent stability of the newly evolved 3
   V spinel-like phase lead to remarkable cycle life despite a wide voltage
   range (2-5 V) involving phase transitions.}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Even though the physics of nanoconfined polymers have been extensively
   studied for years, diffusion of polymer chains along confining
   interfaces has not been widely studied, likely because there are few
   experimental techniques available for these measurements. Here a
   fluorescence recovery after patterned photobleaching (FRAPP) technique
   is developed using an epifluorescence microscope that allows for direct,
   in situ, visualization of polymer diffusion over several periods of a
   photobleached array. This visualization approach is more robust compared
   to measuring fluorescence intensity alone and also significantly
   increases the experimental throughput. Using this technique,
   self-diffusion of poly(isobutyl methacrylate) (PiBMA) was investigated
   at 80 degrees C (29 degrees C above the glass transition temperature,
   T-g) and was found to be film thickness independent down to 30 nm
   (similar to 14R(g), where R-g is the radius of gyration) with a
   diffusion coefficient well predicted by the Rouse model (1.05 x 10(-12)
   cm(2)/s). PiBMA is an ideal polymer for this study because it exhibits a
   film thickness-independent T-g down to 15 nm (similar to 7R(g)) as
   measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Since the diffusion coefficient
   of polymers depends strongly on the proximity of diffusion temperature
   to T-g, this attribute allows a straightforward measure of nanoconfined
   diffusion without superimposed influence from T-g nanoconfinement
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical formulation aimed at modeling the nonlinear

   mechanics in three dimensions. This finite element formulation is based
   on the Eulerian description of motion and the transport of the
   deformation gradient. When modeling a nearly incompressible solid, the
   transport of the deformation gradient is decomposed into its isochoric
   part and the Jacobian determinant as independent fields. A homogeneous
   isotropic hyperelastic solid is assumed and B-splines-based finite
   elements are used for the spatial discretization. A variational
   multiscale residual-based approach is employed to stabilize the
   transport equations. The performance of the scheme is explored for both
   compressible and nearly incompressible applications. The numerical
   results are in good agreement with theory illustrating the viability of
   the computational scheme. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   a phosphotyrosine residue revealed that less favorable binding entropies
   may result from constraining ligands in their biologically active
   conformations. Toward probing the origin of this unexpected finding, we
   examined the complexes of four phosphotyrosine-derived analogues with
   the Grb2 SH2 domain using molecular dynamics simulations with a
   polarizable force field. Significantly, the computed values for the
   relative binding free energies, entropies, and enthalpies of two pairs
   of constrained and unconstrained ligands reproduced the trends that were
   determined experimentally, although the relative differences were
   overestimated. These calculations also revealed that a large fraction of
   the ligands lacking the constraining element exist in solution as
   compact, macrocyclic-like structures that are stabilized by interactions
   between the phosphate groups and the amide moieties of the C-terminal
   pY+2 residues. In contrast, the three-membered ring in the constrained
   ligands prevents the formation of such macrocyclic structures, leading
   instead to globally extended, less ordered conformations. Quasiharmonic
   analysis of these conformational ensembles suggests that the
   unconstrained ligands possess significantly lower entropies in solution,
   a finding that is consistent with the experimental observation that the
   binding entropies for the unconstrained ligands are more favorable than
   for their constrained counterparts. This study suggests that introducing
   local constraints in flexible molecules may have unexpected
   consequences, and a detailed understanding of the conformational
   preferences of ligands in their unbound states is a critical
   prerequisite to correlating changes in their chemical structure with
   protein binding entropies and enthalpies.}},

Abstract = {{Application of derivative voltammetry to methanol oxidation reaction
   (MOR) has been studied, and its advantage in the analysis of various
   aspects of MOR with regard to direct methanol fuel cell has been
   delineated. The derivative technique of voltammetric analysis was
   employed in evaluating and comparing MOR activities of carbon-supported
   mono-, bi-, and tri-metallic electrocatalysts. Significant enhancement
   in the accuracy of estimating voltammetric peak potential and onset
   potential of methanol oxidation current can be achieved in derivative
   voltammetry. Furthermore, the better signal-to-noise ratio of derivative
   voltammetry practically eliminates charging current. From a mechanistic
   point of view, derivative voltammetry is highly sensitive in resolving a
   peak due to parallel path mechanism. Electrochemical stability of anode
   catalysts can be better evaluated and monitored employing derivative
   voltammetry. Nevertheless, the derivative technique is simple and does
   not require further instrumentation or cell assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Human recombinant arginase I cobalt coupled to polyethylene glycol 5000
   (HuArg I {[}Co]-PEG5000) achieved potent in vitro depletion of arginine
   from tissue culture medium and cytotoxicity to many cancer cell lines.
   The recombinant enzyme also produced tumor growth inhibition of
   hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma xenografts. Although
   these results were promising, the therapeutic index was narrow.
   Toxicities were seen in normal cells in tissue culture. In vivo normal
   tissue injury occurred at doses twice the effective dose. The current
   study was conducted to define, in greater detail, the maximum tolerated
   dose (MTD), pharmacodynamics, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
   twice-weekly intraperitoneal HuArg I {[}Co]-PEG5000 in Balb/c mice.
   Animal weight and survival were monitored, serum arginine levels
   measured, and complete blood cell counts, chemistries, necropsies, and
   histologies were performed. In addition, methods to ameliorate the HuArg
   I {[}Co]-PEG5000 adverse effects were tested. Supplemental L-citrulline
   was given concurrently with the arginase drug. The HuArg I
   {[}Co]-PEG5000 MTD in mice was 5 mg/kg twice weekly, and DLTs included
   weight loss and marrow necrosis. No other organ damage or changes in
   blood cell counts or chemistries were observed. Arginase reduced serum
   arginine levels from 60 mu M to 4 to 6 mu M. Supplemental L-citrulline
   given per os or daily subcutaneously reduced and delayed toxicities, and
   L-citrulline given twice daily subcutaneously completely prevented
   animal toxicities. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that
   HuArg I {[}Co]-PEG5000, particularly with supplemental L-citrulline, may
   be an attractive therapeutic agent for argininosuccinate
   synthetase-deficient tumors.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the effect of aggregation and coating thickness of gold on
   the luminescence of nanoparticles engulfed by macrophages and in gelatin
   phantoms. Thin gold-coated iron oxide nanoclusters (nanoroses) have been
   developed to target macrophages to provide contrast enhancement for
   near-infrared optical imaging applications. We compare the brightness of
   nanoroses luminescent emissions in response to 635 nm laser excitation
   to other nanoparticles including nanoshells, nanorods, and Cy5
   conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles. Luminescent properties of all these
   nanoparticles were investigated in monomeric and aggregated form in
   gelatin phantoms and primary macrophage cell cultures using confocal
   microscopy. Aggregation of the gold nanoparticles increased luminescence
   emission and correlated with increased surface mass of gold per
   nanoparticle (nanoshells 37 +/- 14.30 x 10(-3) brightness with 1.23 x
   10(-4) wt of gold (g)/nanoparticle versus original nanorose 1.45 +/-
   0.37 x 10(-3) with 2.10 x 10(-16) wt of gold/nanoparticle, p < 0.05).
   Nanoshells showed greater luminescent intensity than original nanoroses
   or Cy5 conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles when compared as
   nanoparticles per macrophage (38 +/- 10 versus 11 +/- 2.8 versus 17 +/-
   6.5, p < 0.05, respectively, ANOVA), but showed relatively poor

   can be achieved by reducing the thickness of the gold coating, by
   clustering the gold on the surface of the nanoparticles (nanoshells),
   and by clustering the gold nanoparticles themselves. (C) 2012 Society of

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-78}},

Abstract = {{Numerical methods combined with centrifuge tests are used to investigate
   the distribution and development of soil stresses and reinforcement
   tensile loads in geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) structures. In this
   study, system stability indicated by the factor of safety (FS) of GRS
   slopes is calculated by limit equilibrium analysis. Stress information
   under various stress states is evaluated using finite element analysis.
   Advanced models and an integration algorithm are implemented in finite
   element code to enhance the simulation results. The proposed numerical
   models are validated by centrifuge tests of two GRS slopes with
   different backfill densities. Numerical results indicate that soil
   stress mobilisation can be described by the soil stress level S, which
   is defined as the ratio of the current stress status to peak failure
   criteria. For both slope models, as loading increases, backfill stresses
   develop and propagate along the potential failure surface. Mobilisation
   of soil stress was non-uniform along the failure surface. Immediately
   after the stress level reaches peak (S = 1), strength softening
   initiates at the top and toe of the slope at approximately FS = 1.2. The
   slope settlement rate and reinforcement tensile load increase
   significantly when soil softening begins. The softening occurs randomly
   and irregularly along the failure surface, and the formation of the
   soil-softening band completes at approximately FS = 1.1. The failure
   surface corresponds to the locus of intense soil strains and the maximum
   tensile loads at each reinforcement layer. Additionally, the numerical
   results show that the initiation of soil softening and the failure of
   the slope occurred earlier in the slope model with low backfill density.
   The numerical results support the view that peak shear strength, not
   residual shear strength, governs system stability. Last, the
   distribution of maximum reinforcement tensile loads with depth was
   highly uniform at low g-level and became trapezoidal at high g-level.
   The peak value was located at approximately mid-height of the reinforced
   slopes. This observation contradicted the triangular distribution with
   depth assumed in current design methodologies for geosynthetic

Abstract = {{MVI Block vs Trigger Ablation in PMFL. Introduction: Patients with
   previous ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) may experience recurrence
   of perimitral flutter (PMFL). These arrhythmias are usually triggered
   from sources that may also induce AF. This study aims at determining
   whether ablation of triggers or completing mitral valve isthmus (MVI)
   block prevents more arrhythmia recurrences.
   Methods and Results: Sixty-five patients with recurrent PMFL after
   initial ablation of long standing persistent AF were included in this
   study. Thirty-two patients were randomized to MVI ablation only (Group
   1) and 33 were randomized to cardioversion and repeat pulmonary vein
   (PV) isolation plus ablation of non-PV triggers (Group 2). MVI
   bidirectional block was achieved in all but 1 patient from Group 1. In
   Group 2, reconnection of 17 PVs was detected in 14 patients (42\%). With
   isoproterenol challenge, 44 non-PV trigger sites were identified in 28
   patients (85\%, 1.57 sites per patient). At 18-month follow-up, 27
   patients (84\%) from Group 1 had recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias, of
   whom 15 remained on antiarrhythmic drug (AAD); however, 28 patients from
   Group 2 (85\%, P < 0.0001 vs Group 1) were free from arrhythmia off AAD.
   The ablation strategy used in Group 2 was associated with a lower risk
   of recurrence (hazard ratio = 0.10, 95\% CI 0.04-0.28, P < 0.001) and an
   improved arrhythmia-free survival (log rank P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: In patients presenting with PMFL after ablation for
   longstanding persistent AF, MVI block had limited impact on arrhythmia
   recurrence. On the other hand, elimination of all PV and non-PV triggers
   achieved higher freedom from atrial arrhythmias at follow-up. (J

Abstract = {{An overlay of porous asphalt known as permeable friction course (PFC) is
   an innovative roadway material that improves both driving conditions in
   wet weather and water quality. Placed in a layer 25-50 mm thick on top
   of regular impermeable pavement, PFC allows rainfall to drain within the
   porous layer rather than on top of the pavement. This paper presents
   water quality measurements for PFC and conventional pavement collected
   over six years near Austin, TX and two years in eastern North Carolina.
   The data show that concentrations of total suspended solids from PFC are
   more than 90\% lower than from conventional pavement. Lower effluent
   concentrations are also observed for total amounts of phosphorus,
   copper, lead, and zinc. The combined data sets show that PFC's benefits
   last through the design life of the pavement, that results in Texas are
   consistent with those from North Carolina, and that both are consistent
   with earlier studies from France, the Netherlands, and Germany. DOI:

Title = {{Estimation of the nitrogen ionization reaction rate using electric arc
   shock tube data and Bayesian model analysis}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we apply a Bayesian analysis to calibrate the parameters
   of a model for atomic nitrogen ionization using experimental data from
   the electric arc shock tube (EAST) wind-tunnel at NASA. We use a
   one-dimensional plasma flow solver coupled with a radiation solver for
   the simulation of the radiative signature emitted in the shock-heated
   air plasma as well as a Park's two-temperature model for the thermal and
   chemical non-equilibrium effects. We simultaneously quantify model
   parameter uncertainties and physical model inadequacies when solving the
   statistical inverse problem. Prior to the solution of such a problem, we
   perform a sensitivity analysis of the radiative heat flux in order to
   identify important sources of uncertainty. This analysis clearly shows
   the importance of the direct ionization of atomic nitrogen as it mostly
   influences the radiative heating. We then solve the statistical inverse
   problem and compare the calibrated reaction rates against values
   available in the literature. Our calculations estimate the reaction rate
   of the atomic nitrogen ionization to be (3.7 +/- 1.5) x 10(11) cm(3)
   mol(-1) s(-1) at 10000 K, a range consistent with Park's estimation.
   Finally, in order to assess the validity of the estimated parameters, we
   propagate their uncertainties through a statistical forward problem
   defined on a prediction scenario different from the calibration
   scenarios and compare the model predictions against other experimental
   data. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:10.1063/1.3684598]}},

Abstract = {{Typical bilayer wrinkle systems employ soft elastomers as the substrates

   alternatives. Besides the shape fixing capability, shape memory polymers
   distinguish from elastomers in that they are : rigid at room

   hereby report unique aspects of shape memory polymers as the wrinkle
   substrate Utilizing a metallic thin film as the top layer. The
   feasibility to create both reversible and irreversible wrinkles (and
   diffraction colors) on a single substrate is demonstrated. Experimental
   conditions are identified to create crack free wrinkles and the impact
   of various experimental parameters on the wrinkle wavelength and
   amplitude is investigated. The results suggest that the wrinkle
   mechanics deviate notably from the existing theories established with
   elastomers as the wrinkle substrates. Thus, a new theory will need to be
   developed in the future, taking into account of unique thermomechanical
   properties of the shape memory substrate and possible plastic

Abstract = {{Molecular recognition is a fundamental and ubiquitous process that is
   the driving force behind life. Natural recognition elements - including
   antibodies, enzymes, nucleic acids, and cells - exploit non-covalent
   interactions to bind to their targets with exceptionally strong
   affinities. Due to this unparalleled proficiency, scientists have long
   sought to mimic natural recognition pathways. One promising approach is
   molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), which are fully synthetic systems
   formed via the crosslinking of organic polymers in the presence of a
   template molecule, which results in stereo-specific binding sites for
   this analyte of interest. Macromolecularly imprinted polymers, those
   synthesized in the presence of macromolecule templates (>1500 Da), are
   of particular importance because they open up the field for a whole new
   set of robust diagnostic tools. Although the specific recognition of
   small-molecular-weight analytes is now considered routine, extension of
   these efficacious procedures to the protein regime has, thus far, proved
   challenging. This paper reviews the main approaches employed, highlights
   studies of interest with an emphasis on recent work, and offers
   suggestions for future success in the field of macromolecularly
   imprinted polymers. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The transmission capacity of an ad-hoc network is the maximum density of
   active transmitters per unit area, given an outage constraint at each
   receiver for a fixed rate of transmission. Assuming that the transmitter
   locations are distributed as a Poisson point process, this paper derives
   upper and lower bounds on the transmission capacity of an ad-hoc network
   when each node is equipped with multiple antennas. The transmitter
   either uses eigen multi-mode beamforming or a subset of its antennas
   without channel information to transmit multiple data streams, while the
   receiver uses partial zero forcing to cancel certain interferers using
   some of its spatial receive degrees of freedom (SRDOF). The receiver
   either cancels the nearest interferers or those interferers that
   maximize the post-cancellation signal-to-interference ratio. Using the
   obtained bounds, the optimal number of data streams to transmit, and the
   optimal SRDOF to use for interference cancellation are derived that
   provide the best scaling of the transmission capacity with the number of
   antennas. With beamforming, single data stream transmission together
   with using all but one SRDOF for interference cancellation is optimal,
   while without beamforming, single data stream transmission together with
   using a fraction of the total SRDOF for interference cancellation is
   optimal.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of the absence of channel knowledge at the
   transmitters for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) networks.
   Specifically, we assume perfect channel state information at the
   receivers, no channel state information at the transmitter(s), and
   independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading across
   antennas, users and time slots. We provide the characterization of the
   degrees of freedom (DoF) region for a 2-user MIMO broadcast channel. We
   then provide a DoF region outer bound for a 2-user MIMO interference
   channel. This bound is shown to be tight for all possible combinations
   of the number of antennas at each node except for one case. To analyze
   the unsolved case, we point out the potential of interference alignment
   in the 2-user MIMO interference channel with no channel state
   information at the transmitters. As a byproduct, we explore a special
   class of MIMO broadcast channels where the capacity region is
   established by using the outer bound developed in the DoF analysis.}},

Pages = {{626-636}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Interference alignment (IA) is a multiplexing gain optimal transmission
   strategy for the interference channel. While the achieved sum rate with
   IA is much higher than previously thought possible, the improvement
   comes at the cost of requiring network channel state information at the
   transmitters. This can be achieved by explicit feedback, a flexible yet
   potentially costly approach that incurs large overhead. In this paper we
   propose analog feedback as an alternative to limited feedback or
   reciprocity based alignment. We show that the full multiplexing gain
   observed with perfect channel knowledge is preserved by analog feedback
   and that the mean loss in sum rate is bounded by a constant when
   signal-to-noise ratio is comparable in both forward and feedback
   channels. When signal-to-noise ratios are not quite symmetric, a
   fraction of the multiplexing gain is achieved. We consider the overhead
   of training and feedback and use this framework to numerically optimize
   the system's effective throughput. We present simulation results to
   demonstrate the performance of IA with analog feedback, verify our
   theoretical analysis, and extend our conclusions on optimal training and
   feedback length.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate channel direction information is essential to achieve
   considerable capacity gains in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   wireless communication systems. Limited feedback using a polar-cap
   differential codebook which utilizes the temporal correlation in
   multiple-input single-output (MISO) channels is presented in this paper.
   We first describe the general properties of the polar-cap differential
   codebook and then explain the design methodology of the size of the
   polar-cap given the temporal correlation coefficient. We also propose an
   enhancement of the polar-cap differential codebook which is suitable for
   a spatially correlated channel. We compare the polar-cap differential
   codebook with a rotation-based differential codebook in terms of the
   chordal distance to demonstrate the superiority of the polar-cap
   differential codebook. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the
   polar-cap differential codebook facilitates a significant performance
   gain in both temporally and spatially correlated channels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze a constant multiple-input multiple-output
   interference channel where a set of active users are cooperating through

   the channel. We find the minimum number of secondary transmit antennas
   required so that a secondary user can use the channel without affecting
   the sum rate of the active users, under a zero-forcing equalization
   assumption. When the secondary users have enough antennas, we derive
   several secondary user precoders that approximately maximize the
   secondary users' sum rate without changing the sum rate of the active
   users. When the secondary users do not have enough antennas, we perform
   numerical optimization to find secondary user precoders that cause
   minimum degradation to the sum rate of the active users. Through
   simulations, we confirm that i) with enough antennas at the secondary
   users, gains equivalent to the case of all the users cooperating through
   interference alignment is obtainable, and ii) when the secondary users
   do not have enough antennas, large rate losses at the active users can
   be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical doping can decrease sheet resistance of graphene while
   maintaining its high transparency. We report a new method to
   simultaneously transfer and dope chemical vapor deposition grown
   graphene onto a target substrate using a fluoropolymer as both the
   supporting and doping layer. Solvent was used to remove a significant
   fraction of the supporting fluoropolymer, but residual polymer remained
   that doped the graphene significantly. This contrasts with a more widely
   used supporting layer, polymethylmethacrylate, which does not Induce
   significant doping during transfer. The fluoropolymer doping mechanism
   can be explained by the rearrangement of fluorine atoms on the graphene
   basal plane caused by either thermal annealing or soaking in solvent,
   which Induces ordered dipole moments near the graphene surface. This
   simultaneous transfer and doping of the graphene with a fluoropolymer
   increases the carrier density significantly, and the resulting monolayer
   graphene film exhibits a sheet resistance of similar to 320 Omega/sq.
   Finally, the method presented here was used to fabricate flexible and a

Abstract = {{Stabilizing proteins at high concentration is of broad interest in drug
   delivery, for treatment of cancer and many other diseases. Herein, we
   create highly concentrated antibody dispersions (up to 260 mg/mL)
   comprising dense equilibrium nanoclusters of protein (monoclonal
   antibody 1B7, polyclonal sheep immunoglobulin G, and bovine serum
   albumin) molecules which, upon dilution in vitro or administration in
   vivo, remain conformationally stable and biologically active. The
   extremely concentrated environment within the nanoclusters (similar to
   700 mg/mL) provides conformational stability to the protein through a
   novel self-crowding mechanism, as shown by computer simulation, while
   the primarily repulsive nanocluster interactions result in colloidally
   stable, transparent dispersions. The nanoclusters are formed by adding
   trehalose as a cosolute which strengthens the short-ranged attraction
   between protein molecules. The protein cluster diameter was reversibly
   tuned from 50 to 300 nm by balancing short-ranged attraction against
   long-ranged electrostatic repulsion of weakly charged protein at a pH
   near the isoelectric point. This behavior is described
   semiquantitatively with a free energy model which includes the fractal
   dimension of the clusters. Upon dilution of the dispersion in vitro, the
   clusters rapidly dissociated into fully active protein monomers as shown
   with biophysical analysis (SEC, DI.S, CD, and SDS-PAGE) and sensitive
   biological assays. Since the concept of forming nanoclusters by tuning
   colloid interactions is shown to be general, It is likely applicable to
   a variety of biological therapeutics, mitigating the need to engineer
   protein stability through amino acid modification. In vivo subcutaneous
   Injection into mice results in indistinguishable pharmacokinetics versus
   a standard antibody solution. Stable protein dispersions with low
   viscosities may potentially enable patient self-administration by
   subcutaneous injection of antibody. therapeutics being discovered and

Title = {{Quantifying the Behavior of Porous Asphalt Overlays with Respect to
   Drainage Hydraulics and Runoff Water Quality}},

Abstract = {{Porous pavements are gaining popularity in urban settings on highways
   based on their water quality benefits, noise reduction characteristics,
   and the reduced splash and spray they yield in wet weather. Over time,
   porous pavements can become clogged with sediment, resulting in a
   decrease in porosity and hydraulic conductivity as well as a loss of
   drainage benefits. This article provides an overview of water quality
   benefits and methodology for measuring hydraulic conductivity
   specifically for permeable friction course (PFC). PFC is a layer of
   porous asphalt ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 cm thick placed as an overlay on
   conventional impervious roadways. Research studies show a reduction in
   total suspended solids and total metals in runoff from PFC surfaces
   compared to runoff from conventional pavements. Monitoring results were
   mixed for nutrient removal from PFC. Porosity and hydraulic conductivity
   data collected over multiple years from different roadways in Austin,
   TX, are presented. The porosity values of PFC specimens ranged from 0.12
   to 0.23. The non-linear flow relationship observed during hydraulic
   testing requires analysis of the Forchheimer equation, as opposed to the
   typical Darcy's law. Hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 0.02 to
   3.0 cm/s with significant variability. Furthermore, hydraulic modeling
   of PFC is useful for design purposes and determines when the layer
   becomes saturated and surface runoff is expected. Flow through PFC is
   modeled as an unconfined aquifer with an underlying sloping impervious
   boundary. The use of porous pavements in an urban environment not only
   improves driving conditions but also helps reduce the adverse impacts of
   urbanization on surface water and groundwater quality.}},

Abstract = {{Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) has emerged over the past decade
   as a powerful, yet simple, method for imaging of blood flow dynamics in
   real time. The rapid adoption of LSCI for physiological studies is due
   to the relative ease and low cost of building an instrument as well as
   the ability to quantify blood flow changes with excellent spatial and
   temporal resolution. Although measurements are limited to superficial
   tissues with no depth resolution, LSCI has been instrumental in
   pre-clinical studies of neurological disorders as well as clinical
   applications including dermatological, neurosurgical and endoscopic
   studies. Recently a number of technical advances have been developed to
   improve the quantitative accuracy and temporal resolution of speckle
   imaging. This article reviews some of these recent advances and

Abstract = {{Human hand movements have been studied for many decades, yet the role of
   hand biomechanics in achieving dexterity has not been fully understood.
   In this paper, we investigate the contributions of the intrinsic passive
   viscoelastic component in the hand during the coordinated wrist and hand
   movements. We compare the contributions of stiffness, damping, and
   dynamics torques under two types of joint phase movements at two speeds.
   The analysis of the data collected from subject studies demonstrated
   that the passive visco-elastic component is dominant over dynamic
   coupling terms. Although the exact contributions of the three torques
   vary under different speeds and phasic movements, the stiffness torque
   was the highest (at least 47\%) followed by the damping torque, while
   the dynamics torque was the lowest (less than 11\%) in all movement
   scenarios. Comparisons with studies involving coordinated arm movements
   illustrate that dominant torques in arm and hand movements are different
   suggesting that neural control strategies might be distinct as well.}},

   The algorithms differ in the data on which the entropy difference is

   algorithms that require just a single number from the reference for QA.
   The algorithms are shown to correlate very well with subjective quality

Abstract = {{High performance thin film composite (TFC) membranes for reverse osmosis
   applications were fabricated by coating solutions of highly
   chlorine-tolerant disulfonated directly copolymerized poly(arylene ether
   sulfone) random copolymers (BPS-XX, e.g., BPS-20 and 32) on a
   commercially available porous polysulfone (e.g., Udel (R)) support.
   Solvents used in the formation of the TFCs must dissolve the sulfonated
   polysulfones used as the skin materials, while not harming the
   non-sulfonated polysulfone support membrane. For this purpose,
   environmentally friendly solvents were selected via a systematic
   screening process using a triangular solubility diagram. However, these
   benign solvents {[}e.g., di(ethylene glycol)] generally have high
   boiling points (>similar to 190 degrees C). Thus, they necessitate the
   use of a special TFC formation process, since solvent evaporation at
   high temperatures caused pore shrinkage in the polysulfone support
   membrane and could lead to a catastrophic decrease in membrane water
   permeance. Support membranes were initially immersed in an IPA/glycerin
   mixture, after which the IPA was allowed to evaporate, leaving glycerin
   within the membrane pore structure. After a repeated coating procedure
   using dilute BPS-XX solutions, the TFC membranes were dried under vacuum
   at elevated temperatures. During this process, the glycerin reduced pore
   penetration of BPS-XX and prevented pore collapse during the drying
   procedures. Finally, water-miscible glycerin was eliminated via water
   treatment. The newly developed coating method formed ultra-thin and
   defect-free BPS-XX layers on a micro-porous Udel support membrane. For
   example, BPS-32 TFC membranes showed NaCl rejection (similar to 97\%),
   similar to that of its dense membranes. Furthermore, decreasing the
   amount of coating solution and, therefore, the BPS-32 coating thickness,
   resulted in improved pure water flux. The TFC water flux was further
   improved and was accompanied by small reduction in salt rejection after
   various TFC membrane treatments (e.g., in situ acidification or IPA
   treatment). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) can cause devastating neurological
   deficits, including impairment or loss of upper limb and hand function.
   Recently there has been increasing interest in cervical spinal cord
   injury models because the majority of spinal cord injuries are at
   cervical levels. Here we examined spontaneous functional recovery of
   adult rats with either laminectomy or lateral hemisection of the
   cervical spinal cord at C3-C4. Behavioral tests were carried out,
   including the forelimb locomotor scale (FLS), a postural instability
   test (PIT), a pasta-handling test that has been used to assess forepaw
   digit function and latency to eat, forelimb use during vertical-lateral
   wall exploration in a cylindrical enclosure, and vibrissae-elicited
   forelimb placing tests. In addition, a forelimb step-alternation test
   was developed to assess functional recovery at 12 weeks post-injury. All
   tests detected cSCI-induced deficits relative to laminectomy.
   Interestingly, the severity of deficits in the forelimb step-alternation
   test was associated with more extensive spinal damage, greater
   impairment, and less recovery in the FLS and other tests. For the
   pasta-handling test we found that rats with a milder cervical injury
   (alternators) were more likely to use both forepaws together compared to
   rats with a more severe injury (non-alternators). In addition, using the
   PIT, we detected enhanced function of the good limb, suggesting that
   neural plasticity on the unaffected side of the spinal cord may have
   occurred to compensate for deficits in the impaired forelimb. These
   outcome measures should be useful for investigating neural events
   associated with cSCI, and for developing novel treatment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by data-driven decision making and sampling problems, we
   investigate probabilistic interpretations of robust optimization (RO).
   We establish a connection between RO and distributionally robust
   stochastic programming (DRSP), showing that the solution to any RO
   problem is also a solution to a DRSP problem. Specifically, we consider
   the case where multiple uncertain parameters belong to the same fixed
   dimensional space and find the set of distributions of the equivalent
   DRSP problem. The equivalence we derive enables us to construct RO
   formulations for sampled problems (as in stochastic programming and
   machine learning) that are statistically consistent, even when the
   original sampled problem is not. In the process, this provides a
   systematic approach for tuning the uncertainty set. The equivalence
   further provides a probabilistic explanation for the common shrinkage
   heuristic, where the uncertainty set used in an RO problem is a shrunken
   version of the original uncertainty set.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{330-344}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Novel methods are proposed for dealing with event-tree analysis under
   imprecise probabilities, where one could measure chance or uncertainty
   without sharp numerical probabilities and express available evidence as
   upper and lower previsions (or expectations) of gambles (or bounded real
   functions). Sets of upper and lower previsions generate a convex set of
   probability distributions (or measures). Any probability distribution in
   this convex set should be considered in the event-tree analysis. This
   article focuses on the calculation of upper and lower bounds of the
   prevision (or the probability) of some outcome at the bottom of the
   event-tree. Three cases of given information/judgments on probabilities
   of outcomes are considered: (1) probabilities conditional to the
   occurrence of the event at the upper level; (2) total probabilities of
   occurrences, that is, not conditional to other events; (3) the
   combination of the previous two cases. Corresponding algorithms with
   imprecise probabilities under the three cases are explained and
   illustrated by simple examples.}},

Abstract = {{The methods used to estimate tissue elasticity based on the motion of
   local inhomogeneities such as laser-induced gas microbubbles, magnetic
   nanoparticles and other targets under an externally applied force are
   reviewed. The theoretical bases of the motion of a target in a
   viscoelastic medium are described. Given various targets differing in
   size, these methods allow for elasticity measurements at different
   levels of spatial resolution. Short acoustic radiation force and
   magnetic field pulses were used to initiate the motion of various test
   objects (solid spheres, laser-induced microbubbles and magnetic
   nanoparticles) with sizes ranging from several millimeters to tens of
   nanometers. The induced motion was monitored by conventional pulse-echo
   ultrasound systems adapted for these measurements. The elasticity of the
   medium was evaluated based on a theoretical model describing the motion
   of a particle in a viscoelastic medium. Shear elasticity, evaluated
   using the developed approach, agrees well with independent measurements
   of mechanical properties of the medium. In this paper we review our
   recent theoretical and experimental results and discuss the applications
   of elasticity imaging and sensing using targeted motion, i.e., motion
   induced via the external forces acting on local inhomogeneities.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-wavelength photonic structures and nanoscale materials have the
   potential to greatly improve the efficiencies of solar cells by enabling
   maximum absorption of sunlight. Semiconductor heterostructures provide
   versatile opportunities for improving absorption of infrared radiation
   in photovoltaic devices, which accounts for half of the power in the
   solar spectrum. These ideas can be combined in quantum-well solar cells
   and related structures in which sub-wavelength metal and dielectric
   scattering elements are integrated for light trapping. Measurements and
   simulations of GaAs solar cells with less than one micron of active
   material demonstrate the benefits of incorporating In(Ga) As
   quantum-wells and quantum-dots to improve their performance. Simulations
   that incorporate a realistic model of absorption in quantum-wells show
   that the use of broadband photonic structures with such devices can
   substantially improve the benefit of incorporating heterostructures,
   enabling meaningful improvements in their performance.}},

   baseband amplification is achieved using a transimpedance amplifier.
   Active noise shaping networks are implemented for reducing low-frequency
   noise at the output that can arise from the RF and baseband
   transconductors. Linearity is enhanced by synthesizing a nonlinear gain
   in the transimpedance amplifier to compensate for baseband compression.
   The design includes variable gain capability. An on-chip divider is
   employed to synthesize quadrature LO signals. Noise and linearity
   performance of the core down-converter is analyzed. The receiver is
   implemented in a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. The prototype achieves a
   maximum conversion gain of 44.5 dB, NF of 4.3 dB, in-channel OIP3 of 20
   dBV while consuming 2.2 mA in each of the quadrature paths from a 1.8 V
   supply. This performance is achieved without the use of integrated
   inductors, which allows for a small die area of 0.5 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{The influence of hydraulic loads on the detachment of particles from the
   collector surface or from previously retained particles was observed in
   a packed glass beads column. A hydraulic shock load (i.e., 20\% increase
   of flow rate) was applied after 4 h of particle attachment at a constant
   flow rate. A single type of particle suspension (Min-U-Sil 5, nearly
   pure SiO2) and three different chemical conditions (pH control, alum and
   polymer destabilization) were utilized. The magnitude of particle
   detachment increased with increasing particle size for non-Brownian
   particles because more shear force was applied to large particles due to
   their large surface area. More favorable particles (i.e., particles with
   small surface charge) were detached to a lesser extent than unfavorable
   particles during the hydraulic shock loads application. This phenomenon
   can be caused by floc strength. In some cases, when the zeta potential
   of influent particles was relatively high, the magnitude of detachment
   of bigger particles (e.g., 4.0-5.0 mu m) was less than that of smaller
   particles (e.g., 3.0-4.0 mu m). This can be attributable to the breakup
   of detached flocs as an individual particle. It was also found that the
   shape of the curve relating the magnitude of particle detachment and
   particle size can be concave, linear, or convex depending on
   physicochemical conditions such as floc strength. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Electronic beam lithography (EBL) is one of the promising emerging
   technologies in the sub-22 nm regime. In EBL, the desired circuit
   patterns are directly shot into the wafer, which overcomes the
   diffraction limit of light in the current optical lithography system.
   However, the low throughput becomes its key technical hurdle. In the
   conventional EBL system, each rectangle in the layout will be projected
   by one electronic shot through a variable shape beam (VSB). This could
   be extremely slow. As an improved EBL technology, character projection
   (CP) shoots complex shapes, so-called characters, in one time, by
   putting them into a predesigned stencil. However, only a limited number
   of characters can be employed, due to the area constraint. Those
   patterns, not contained by any character, are still required to be
   written by VSB. A key problem is how to select an optimal set of
   characters and pack them on the CP stencil to minimize total processing
   time. In this paper, we investigate a problem of electronic beam
   lithography stencil design with overlapped characters. Different from
   previous works, besides selecting appropriate characters, their
   placements on the stencil are also optimized in our framework.
   Specifically, we propose a Hamilton-path-based iterative algorithm to
   handle 1-D stencil design problem, and an effective simulated annealing
   framework for the generalized 2-D case with an efficient look-ahead
   sequence pair evaluation technique. The experimental results show that,
   compared to conventional stencil design methodology without overlapped
   characters, we are able to reduce total projection time by 51\%.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Galloping of structures such as transmission lines and bridges is a
   classical aeroelastic instability that has been considered as harmful
   and destructive. However, there exists potential to harness useful
   energy from this phenomenon. This paper focuses on harvesting wind
   energy that is being transferred to a galloping beam. The beam has a
   rigid tip body with a D-shaped cross section. Piezoelectric sheets are
   bonded on the top and bottom surface of the beam. During galloping,
   vibrational motion is input to the system due to aerodynamic forces on
   the D-section, which is converted into electrical energy by the
   piezoelectric (PZT) sheets. The relative importance of various
   parameters of the system such as wind speed, material properties of the
   beam, electrical load and beam's natural frequency are discussed.
   Experimental and analytical investigations of dynamic response and power
   output are performed on a representative device. A maximum output power
   of 1.14 mW was measured at a wind velocity of 10.5 mph on a prototype
   device of length 235 mm and width 25 mm. A potential application for
   this device is to power wireless sensor networks on outdoor structures

Abstract = {{Exhaustive enumeration of sequences and folds is conducted for a simple
   lattice model of conformations, sequences, and energies. Examination of
   all foldable sequences and their nearest connected neighbors (sequences
   that differ by no more than a point mutation) illustrates the following:
   (i) There exist unusually large number of sequences that fold into a few
   structures (super-folds). The same observation was made experimentally
   and computationally using stochastic sampling and exhaustive enumeration
   of related models. (ii) There exist only a few large networks of
   connected sequences that are not restricted to one fold. These networks
   cover a significant fraction of fold spaces (super-networks). (iii)
   There exist barriers in sequence space that prevent foldable sequences
   of the same structure to connect through a series of single point
   mutations (super-barrier), even in the presence of the sequence
   connection between folds. While there is ample experimental evidence for
   the existence of super-folds, evidence for a super-network is just
   starting to emerge. The prediction of a sequence barrier is an
   intriguing characteristic of sequence space, suggesting that the overall
   sequence space may be disconnected. The implications and limitations of
   these observations for evolution of protein structures are discussed.

Abstract = {{The effects of forcing and partial premixing on the mixing
   characteristics and pollutant emissions of jet flames in crossflow
   (JFICF) are studied experimentally for 70\% methane/30\% hydrogen fuel
   blend and propane. For forced non-premixed JFICF, the jet fuel flow is
   modulated using an acoustic speaker system, which results in a drastic
   decrease in flame length and soot luminosity. Simultaneous planar laser
   Mie scattering and CH{*} chemiluminescence imaging is used to detail the
   flame structure and dynamics of the reacting forced non-premixed JFICF,
   whereas acetone planar laser-induced fluorescence is used to quantify
   the near-field mixing of the non-reacting case. Forced JFICF are
   characterized by periodic ejections of high-momentum, deeply penetrating
   vortical structures, which draw air into the jet nozzle and enhance
   mixing in the near-field region of the jet. The mixing enhancement
   effectively partially premixes the jet fluid below the flame base. Flame
   luminosity images and exhaust gas emissions measurements show that
   forced non-premixed JFICF exhibit similar characteristics to unforced
   partially-premixed JFICF. Both strong forcing and partial premixing
   result in net reductions in NO(x), but increases in CO and unburned
   hydrocarbons. NO(x) scaling analysis is presented for both forced
   non-premixed and unforced partially premixed flames. Using flame volume
   arguments, EI(NOx) scales with amplitude ratio, but does not scale with
   partial premixing. The difference in scaling behavior is attributed to
   differences in flame structure. (C) 2011 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{This article presents an efficient parametric optimization method for
   the biobjective optimal routing problem. The core process is a bounded
   greedy single-objective shortest path approximation algorithm. This
   method avoids the computationally intensive dominance check with
   labeling methods and overcomes the deficiency with existing parametric
   methods that can only find extreme nondominated paths. Moreover, we
   propose a decomposition scheme to convert a multiobjective routing
   problem into a number of biobjective problems. We then compare its
   computational performance against the classic label-correcting method
   over a set of synthetically generated random networks and illustrate its
   algorithmic advances and solution behaviors by an example application of
   routing hazardous materials in a U.S. northeastern highway network.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on determining the effects of variability on key mix

   through the evaluation of the results obtained from volumetric
   properties and laboratory tests, such as flexural fatigue test, Hamburg
   wheel-tracking test, and overlay tester. A series of statistical
   analyses were conducted to develop relationships between the key mix
   design factors and the observed laboratory performances of each type of
   mixture. From the analysis, the effects of the main variables on the
   results of the performance tests used in this study were found.
   Finally, a statistical sensitivity analysis was conducted to reveal the
   relationship between different tolerance levels and mixture performance.
   Based on the findings of this sensitivity analysis, recommendations to
   revise the current TxDOT operational tolerances and performance-based
   pay adjustment factors for contractual jobs were provided that not only
   commends high quality and a consistent end product but also promotes
   superior performing mixtures based on the analysis of laboratory data.

   process. The first stage involves the emulsion losing water as it cools
   down from its application temperature until it is in a state of thermal
   equilibrium with the surrounding environment while the latter involves
   determining the amount of moisture loss due to the vapor pressure
   deficit in the ambient air and the turbulence in the surrounding

Abstract = {{This paper describes two fused floating-point operations and applies

   The fused operations are a two-term dot product and an add-subtract

   multiplications, additions, and subtractions of complex valued data.
   Both radix-2 and radix-4 butterflies are implemented efficiently with
   the two fused floating-point operations. When placed and routed using a
   high performance standard cell technology, the fused FFT butterflies are
   about 15 percent faster and 30 percent smaller than a conventional
   implementation. Also the numerical results of the fused implementations
   are slightly more accurate, since they use fewer rounding operations.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Pervasive computing applications often involve sensor-rich networking
   environments that capture various types of user contexts such as
   locations, activities, vital signs, and so on. Such context information
   is useful in a variety of applications, for example, monitoring health
   information to promote independent living in ``aging-in-place{''}
   scenarios, or providing safety and security of people and
   infrastructures. In reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts are
   often ambiguous, thus leading to potentially dangerous decisions if not
   properly handled. Therefore, a significant challenge in the design and
   development of realistic and deployable context-aware services for
   pervasive computing applications lies in the ability to deal with
   ambiguous contexts. In this paper, we propose a resource-optimized,
   quality-assured context mediation framework for sensor networks. The
   underlying approach is based on efficient context-aware data fusion,
   information-theoretic reasoning, and selection of sensor parameters,
   leading to an optimal state estimation. In particular, we apply dynamic
   Bayesian networks to derive context and deal with context ambiguity or
   error in a probabilistic manner. Experimental results using SunSPOT
   sensors demonstrate the promise of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{How can knowing about some categories help us to discover new ones in
   unlabeled images? Unsupervised visual category discovery is useful to
   mine for recurring objects without human supervision, but existing
   methods assume no prior information and thus tend to perform poorly for
   cluttered scenes with multiple objects. We propose to leverage knowledge
   about previously learned categories to enable more accurate discovery,
   and address challenges in estimating their familiarity in unsegmented,
   unlabeled images. We introduce two variants of a novel object-graph
   descriptor to encode the 2D and 3D spatial layout of object-level
   co-occurrence patterns relative to an unfamiliar region and show that by
   using them to model the interaction between an image's known and unknown
   objects, we can better detect new visual categories. Rather than mine
   for all categories from scratch, our method identifies new objects while
   drawing on useful cues from familiar ones. We evaluate our approach on
   several benchmark data sets and demonstrate clear improvements in
   discovery over conventional purely appearance-based baselines.}},

Abstract = {{The health effects associated with exposure to ozone range from
   respiratory irritation to increased mortality. In this paper, we explore
   the use of three green building materials and an activated carbon (AC)
   mat that remove ozone from indoor air. We studied the effects of
   long-term exposure of these materials to real environments on ozone
   removal capability and pre-and postozonation emissions. A field study
   was completed over a 6-month period, and laboratory testing was
   intermittently conducted on material samples retrieved from the field.
   The results show sustained ozone removal for all materials except
   recycled carpet, with greatest ozone deposition velocity for AC mat
   (2.5-3.8 m/h) and perlite-based ceiling tile (2.2-3.2 m/h). Carbonyl
   emission rates were low for AC across all field sites. Painted gypsum
   wallboard and perlite-based ceiling tile had similar overall emission
   rates over the 6-month period, while carpet had large initial emission
   rates of undesirable by-products that decayed rapidly but remained high
   compared with other materials. This study confirms that AC mats and
   perlite-based ceiling tile are viable surfaces for inclusion in
   buildings to remove ozone without generating undesirable by-products.}},

Abstract = {{The water vapor transfer across a Nafion (R) membrane exhibits an
   undesired non-minimum phase behavior. This paper will show that even in
   the disturbance-to-output loop, the non-minimum phase zero adversely
   affects the feedback controller design because of the coupling effect
   between the disturbance-to-output and the input-to-output loops. The
   non-minimum phase zero location is influenced by the channel plate
   structure and the membrane material property. The structural parameters
   examined in this research include channel plate dimensions and heat
   transfer coefficients. The membrane properties studied include membrane
   vapor transfer properties described in the Arrhenius' equation. A
   governing equation to link the non-minimum phase zero and the parameters
   is developed in this paper. This equation shows that the non-minimum
   phase zero arises from the competing heat and mass transfer dynamics,
   and is determined by the structural parameters and membrane properties.
   A sensitivity study is presented and shows that structural and material
   property optimization can be used with the control system design to
   mitigate the non-minimum phase behavior in the PEM fuel cell
   humidification system. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4003752]}},

Abstract = {{Scheduling policies that favor small jobs have received growing
   attention due to their superior performance with respect to mean delay,
   e. g., Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) and Preemptive Shortest
   Job First (PSJF). In this paper, we study the delay distribution of a
   generalization of the class of scheduling policies called SMART (because
   policies in it have ``SMAll Response Times{''}), which includes SRPT,
   PSJF, and a range of practical variants, in a discrete-time queueing
   system under the many sources large deviations regime.
   Our analysis of SMART in this regime (large number of flows and large
   capacity) hinges on a novel two-dimensional (2-D) queueing framework
   that employs virtual queues and total ordering of jobs. We prove that
   all SMART policies have the same asymptotic delay distribution as SRPT,
   i.e., the delay distribution has the same decay rate. In addition, we
   illustrate the improvements SMART policies make over First Come First
   Serve (FCFS) and Processor Sharing (PS).
   Our 2-D queueing technique is generalizable to other policies as well.
   As an example, we show how the Foreground-Background (FB) policy can be
   analyzed using a 2-D queueing framework. FB is a policy, not contained
   in SMART, which manages to bias towards small jobs without knowing which
   jobs are small in advance.}},

Abstract = {{Muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) isolated from murine skeletal tissue
   by the preplate method have displayed the capability to commit to the
   myogenic lineage and regenerate more efficiently than myoblasts in
   skeletal and cardiac muscle in murine Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy mice
   (mdx). However, until now, these studies have not been translated to
   human muscle cells. Here, we describe the isolation, by a preplate
   technique, of candidate human MDSCs, which exhibit myogenic and
   regenerative characteristics similar to their murine counterparts. Using
   the preplate isolation method, we compared cells that adhere faster to
   the flasks, preplate 2 (PP2), and cells that adhere slower, preplate 6
   (PP6). The human PP6 cells express several markers of mesenchymal stem
   cells and are distinct from human PP2 (a myoblast-like population) based
   on their expression of CD146 and myogenic markers desmin and CD56. After
   transplantation to the gastrocnemius muscle of mdx/SCID mice, we observe
   significantly higher levels of PP6 cells participating in muscle
   regeneration as compared with the transplantation of PP2 cells. This
   study supports some previous findings related to mouse preplate cells,
   and also identifies some differences between mouse and human muscle
   preplate cells.}},

Abstract = {{Bone regeneration can be accelerated by utilizing mechanical stress and
   growth factors (GFs). However, a limited understanding exists regarding
   the response of preosteoblasts to tensile stress alone or with GFs. We
   measured cell proliferation and expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs)
   and other bone-related proteins by preosteoblasts following cyclic
   tensile stress (1\%-10\% magnitude) alone or in combination with bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and transforming growth factor-beta 1
   (TGF-beta 1). Tensile stress (3\%) with GFs induced greater gene
   upregulation of osteoprotegerin (3.3 relative fold induction {[} RFI]
   compared to sham-treated samples), prostaglandin E synthase 2 (2.1 RFI),
   and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (11.5 RFI), compared with
   samples treated with stimuli alone or sham-treated samples. The most
   significant increases in messenger RNA expression occurred with GF
   addition to either static-cultured or tensile-loaded (1\% elongation)
   cells for the following genes: HSP47 (RFI = 2.53), cyclooxygenase-2 (RFI
   = 72.52), bone sialoprotein (RFI = 11.56), and TGF-beta 1 (RFI = 8.05).
   Following 5\% strain with GFs, VEGF secretion increased 64\% (days 3-6)
   compared with GF alone and cell proliferation increased 23\% compared
   with the sham-treated group. GF addition increased osteocalcin secretion
   but decreased matrix metalloproteinase-9 significantly (days 3-6).
   Tensile stress and GFs in combination may enhance bone regeneration by
   initiating angiogenic and anti-osteoclastic effects and promote cell
   growth.}},

   phenomenon often called motion hyperacuity. We describe how such motion
   hyperacuity can be achieved through a controlled preblurring of an
   optical imaging system. We used this method to develop a software model
   of a new fly eye sensor and to optimize its motion hyperacuity. Finally,
   we compare the completed sensor to previously developed fly eye sensors.
   The new design shows a threefold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio

Abstract = {{The majority of heart attacks occur when there is a sudden rupture of
   atherosclerotic plaque, exposing prothrombotic emboli to coronary blood
   flow, forming clots that can cause blockages of the arterial lumen.
   Diseased arteries can be treated with drugs delivered locally to
   vulnerable plaques. The objective of this work was to develop a
   computational tool-set to support the design and analysis of a
   catheter-based nanoparticulate drug delivery system to treat vulnerable
   plaques and diffuse atherosclerosis. A three-dimensional mathematical
   model of coupled mass transport of drug and drug-encapsulated
   nanoparticles was developed and solved numerically utilizing
   isogeometric finite element analysis. Simulations were run on a
   patient-specific multilayered coronary artery wall segment with a
   vulnerable plaque and the effect of artery and plaque inhomogeneity was
   analyzed. The method captured trends observed in local drug delivery and
   demonstrated potential for optimizing drug design parameters, including
   delivery location, nanoparticle surface properties, and drug release
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study, atomic layer deposited (ALD) BeO exhibited less
   interface defect density and hysteresis, as well as less frequency
   dispersion and leakage current density, at the same equivalent oxide
   thickness than Al2O3. Furthermore, its self-cleaning effect was better.
   In this study, the physical and electrical characteristics of ALD BeO
   grown on Si and GaAs substrates are further evaluated as a gate
   dielectric layer in III-V metal-oxide-semiconductor devices using
   transmission electron microscopy, selective area electron diffraction,
   second harmonic generation, and electrical analysis. An as-grown ALD BeO
   thin film was revealed as a layered single crystal structure, unlike the
   well-known ALD dielectrics that exhibit either poly-crystalline or
   amorphous structures. Low defect density in highly ordered ALD BeO film,
   less variability in electrical characteristics, and great stability
   under electrical stress were demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Over limiting current by interactive ionic transport between space
   charge region and electric double layer near ion-exchange membranes}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{285}},
Pages = {{245-252}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{In electrodialysis, a theoretical understanding of overlimiting current
   (greater ionic transport beyond the electroneutrality limit) has not
   been clearly demonstrated, despite two hypothetical explanations: the
   water splitting reaction and electro-convection. To suggest another
   possible mechanism for this phenomenon, the Nernst-Planck-Poisson
   equations were solved via the Painleve equation of the second kind.
   Numerical simulations found that the initiation of overlimiting current
   involves a substantial redistribution of the ionic charge near the
   membrane surface. To maintain a constant ionic charge in the aqueous
   phase near the membrane while the non-electroneutral space charge region
   grows, the shrinking electric double layer in the aqueous-phase releases
   ionic charges toward the membrane. Frequent repetition of this charge
   redistribution can contribute additional current above the limiting
   current without a large investment of electrical potential. A
   sensitivity study found that the relationship between the growth of the
   space charge region and applied potential is independent of the
   membrane's ion exchange capacity and the ionic diffusivity; however, the
   amount of the ionic charge created in the space charge region was
   greater with a greater bulk concentration or with an electrolyte solvent
   of a greater permittivity. These findings are consistent with previous
   experimental studies in the overlimiting current regime. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Ischemia of the myocardium and lower limbs is a common consequence of
   arterial disease and a major source of morbidity and mortality in
   modernized countries. Inducing neovascularization for the treatment of
   ischemia is an appealing therapeutic strategy for patients for whom
   traditional treatment modalities cannot be performed or are ineffective.
   In the past, the stimulation of blood vessel growth was pursued using
   direct delivery of growth factors, angiogenic gene therapy, or cellular
   therapy. Although therapeutic angiogenesis holds great promise for
   treating patients with ischemia, current methods have not found success
   in clinical trials. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was one of the
   first growth factors to be tested for use in therapeutic angiogenesis.
   Here, we present a method for improving the biological activity of FGF-2
   by codelivering the growth factor with a liposomally embedded
   coreceptor, syndecan-4. This technique was shown to increase FGF-2
   cellular signaling, uptake, and nuclear localization in comparison with
   FGF-2 alone. Delivery of syndecan-4 proteoliposomes also increased
   endothelial proliferation, migration, and angiogenic tube formation in
   response to FGF-2. Using an animal model of limb ischemia, syndecan-4
   proteoliposomes markedly improved the neovascularization following
   femoral artery ligation and recovery of perfusion of the ischemic limb.
   Taken together, these results support liposomal delivery of syndecan-4
   as an effective means to improving the potential of using growth factors
   to achieve therapeutic neovascularization of ischemic tissue.}},

Title = {{Giant Enhancement of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in the
   Subwavelength Limit}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is traditionally viewed as a
   process whose strength is dictated by intrinsic material nonlinearities
   with little dependence on waveguide geometry. We show that this paradigm
   breaks down at the nanoscale, as tremendous radiation pressures produce
   new forms of SBS nonlinearities. A coherent combination of radiation
   pressure and electrostrictive forces is seen to enhance both forward and
   backward SBS processes by orders of magnitude, creating new geometric
   degrees of freedom through which photon-phonon coupling becomes highly
   tailorable. At nanoscales, the backward-SBS gain is seen to be 10(4)
   times greater than in conventional silica fibers with 100 times greater
   values than predicted by conventional SBS treatments. Furthermore,
   radically enhanced forward-SBS processes are 10(5) times larger than any
   known waveguide system. In addition, when nanoscale silicon waveguides
   are cooled to low temperatures, a further 10-100 times increase in SBS
   gain is seen as phonon losses are reduced. As a result, a 100-mu m
   segment of the waveguide has equivalent nonlinearity to a kilometer of
   fiber. Couplings of this magnitude would enable efficient chip-scale
   stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon waveguides for the first
   time. More generally, we develop a new full-vectorial theoretical
   formulation of stimulated Brillouin scattering that accurately
   incorporates the effects of boundary-induced nonlinearities and
   radiation pressure, both of which are seen to have tremendous impact on
   photon-phonon coupling at subwavelength scales. This formalism, which
   treats both intermode and intramode coupling within periodic and
   translationally invariant waveguide systems, reveals a rich landscape of
   new stimulated Brillouin processes when applied to nanoscale systems.}},

Abstract = {{We report the experimental verification of metamaterial cloaking for a
   3D object in free space. We apply the plasmonic cloaking technique,
   based on scattering cancellation, to suppress microwave scattering from
   a finite-length dielectric cylinder. We verify that scattering
   suppression is obtained all around the object in the near- and far-field
   and for different incidence angles, validating our measurements with
   analytical results and full-wave simulations. Our near-field and
   far-field measurements confirm that realistic and robust plasmonic
   metamaterial cloaks may be realized for elongated 3D objects with
   moderate transverse cross-section at microwave frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide)/porous silicon (PLGA/pSi)
   composite microspheres, synthesized by a solid-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W)
   emulsion method, are developed for the long-term controlled delivery of
   biomolecules for orthopedic tissue engineering applications. Confocal
   and fluorescent microscopy, together with material analysis, show that
   each composite microsphere contained multiple pSi particles embedded
   within the PLGA matrix. The release profiles of fluorescein
   isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA), loaded
   inside the pSi within the PLGA matrix, indicate that both PLGA and pSi
   contribute to the control of the release rate of the payload. Protein
   stability studies show that PLGA/pSi composite can protect BSA from
   degradation during the long term release. We find that during the
   degradation of the composite material, the presence of the pSi particles
   neutralizes the acidic pH due to the PLGA degradation by-products, thus
   minimizing the risk of inducing inflammatory responses in the exposed
   cells while stimulating the mineralization in osteogenic growth media.
   Confocal studies show that the cellular uptake of the composite
   microspheres is avoided, while the fluorescent payload is detectable
   intracellularly after 7 days of co-incubation. In conclusion, the
   PLGA/pSi composite microspheres offer an additional level of controlled
   release and could be ideal candidates as drug delivery vehicles for
   orthopedic tissue engineering applications.}},

Title = {{Forchheimer flow in gently sloping layers: Application to drainage of
   porous asphalt}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents analytical solutions for the problem of steady
   one-dimensional Forchheimer flow in an unconfined layer. The study's
   motivation is the drainage behavior of a highway pavement called
   permeable friction course. Permeable friction course is a layer of
   porous asphalt placed on top of impermeable pavement. Porous overlays
   are growing in popularity because they reduce noise, mitigate the
   hazards of wet weather driving, and produce cleaner runoff. Several of
   these benefits occur because water drains within the pavement rather
   than on the road surface. Drainage from the friction course is
   essentially that of an unconfined aquifer and has been successfully
   modeled using Darcy's law and the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumptions. Under
   certain cases, drainage may occur outside of the range where Darcy's law
   applies. The purpose of this paper is to identify cases where the
   assumption of Darcy flow is violated, develop analytical solutions based
   on Forchheimer's equation, and compare the solutions with those obtained
   for the Darcy case. The principle assumptions used in this analysis are
   that the relationship between hydraulic gradient and specific discharge
   is quadratic in nature (Forchheimer's equation) and that the
   Dupuit-Forchheimer assumptions apply. Comparing the Darcy and
   Forchheimer solutions leads to a new criterion for assessing the
   applicability of Darcy's law termed the discharge ratio.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{53}},

Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending various sodium (Na+) and
   potassium (K+) ionomers formed from poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid)
   and the M-2(HT)(2) organoclay formed from montmorillonite (MMT). The
   effects of the neutralization level of the acid groups and the precursor
   melt index on the morphology and properties of the nanocomposites were
   evaluated using stress-strain analysis, wide angle X-ray scattering
   (WAXS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with particle
   analysis. The aspect ratio generally increases as the neutralization
   level increases, except for Na+ ionomer nanocomposites with
   neutralization levels >50\%. It appears from both WAXS and TEM analyses
   that Na+ ionomer nanocomposites have higher levels of MMT exfoliation
   and particle orientation in the flow direction than K+
   ionomer.nanocomposites. DSC results indicate that the level of
   crystallinity in the Na+ ionomers generally increases slightly with MMT
   addition, while the crystallinity in the K+ ionomers decreases slightly
   with MMT addition. The relative modulus of K+ ionomer nanocomposites
   increases as the degree of neutralization increases. The relative moduli
   of Na+ ionomer nanocomposites are higher than the relative modulus of K+
   ionomer nanocomposites, likely due to the increased crystallinity of the
   Na+ ionomers and the decreased crystallinity of the K+ ionomers upon
   addition of MMT, the higher exfoliation levels measured by the aspect
   ratios and the particle densities, and the higher particle orientation
   indicated by TEM and WAXS. The relative modulus generally increases as
   the aspect ratio increases. The elongation at break generally decreases
   as the MMT content increases and as the neutralization level increases
   for both ionomer types. The fracture energy of most of the ionomers
   increases with the addition of MMT, reaches a maximum between 2.5 and 5
   wt\% MMT, and then decreases upon further MMT addition. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The effects of the degree of neutralization of the acid groups and, to

   mechanical properties of two series of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic
   acid) (EMAA) ionomers, one based on sodium (Na+) cations and one based
   on potassium cations (K+), were examined. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) and modulus results indicate that the secondary
   crystallization of the ionomers is generally completed 21 days after
   melt processing. DSC results indicate that the extent of crystallization
   increases with increasing neutralization level. The mechanical
   relaxation seen by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) in the vicinity of
   the secondary crystal melting point shifts to higher temperatures as the
   neutralization level increases. The theological properties increase with
   decreasing precursor melt index and with increasing neutralization level
   to a lesser extent. The ionomer modulus and yield strength increase with
   increasing neutralization level up to 40\% neutralization and then
   plateau or slightly decrease with further neutralization. The
   plateaus/maxima may be the result of an optimal spacing of alkaline ions
   and carboxyl groups within ionic groups at neutralization levels near
   33\%. The elongation at break and the Izod impact strength decrease with
   increasing neutralization. The modulus, yield stress, and impact
   strength are generally lowest for the ionomers with the highest

Abstract = {{Through-silicon via is a critical element for three-dimensional (3D)
   integration of devices in multilevel stack structures. Thermally induced
   stresses in through-silicon vias (TSVs) have raised serious concerns
   over mechanical and electrical reliability in 3D technology. An
   experimental technique is presented to characterize thermal stresses in
   TSVs during thermal cycling based on curvature measurements of bending
   beam specimens. Focused ion beam and electron backscattering diffraction
   analyses reveal significant grain growth in copper vias, which is
   correlated with stress relaxation during the first cycle. Finite element
   analysis is performed to determine the stress distribution and the
   effect of localized plasticity and to account for TSV extrusion observed
   during annealing. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We investigated the colors of graphene and graphene-oxide multilayers
   that were deposited on various dielectric layers. In particular, the
   effects of the material thickness, the types of dielectric layers, and
   the existence of a back silicon substrate were analyzed. The colors of
   graphene-oxide layers on a SiO(2)/Si substrate were found to
   periodically change as the material thickness increased. However, the
   colors of graphene layers on the same substrate became saturated without
   a similar periodic change. The calculated colors corresponding to the
   material thicknesses were verified by optical microscopy and
   profilometry. We believe that these results demonstrate the possibility
   of utilizing color as a simple tool for detecting and estimating the
   thicknesses of graphene and graphene-oxide multilayers.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is
   limited largely by sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics,
   even when promoted by Pt-based alloy nanoparticles (NPs). Acid-leached
   Pt alloys such as ``Pt3Co{''} have shown considerably higher specific
   (2-5 times) and mass (2 to 3 times) ORR activity than Pt NPs. However,
   the specific activity enhancement of ``Pt3Co{''} NPs decreases during
   PEMFC operation, which has been attributed to the formation of a
   Pt-enriched shell near the NP surfaces. In this study, we report direct
   evidence of surface Pt and Co compositional changes in acid-treated
   ``Pt3Co{''} NPs after PEMFC voltage cycling using energy-dispersive
   spectroscopy mapping in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission
   electron microscope with subnanometer resolution. Acid-treated
   ``Pt3Co{''} NPs were found to have Pt-enriched shells of similar to 0.5
   nm, whereas the Pt-enriched-shell became thicker (similar to 1-6 nm)
   after PEMFC voltage cycling, where greater shell thicknesses were
   associated with larger ``Pt3Co{''} NPs.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{929-936}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Much of human exposure to ambient ozone and ozone reaction byproducts
   occurs inside buildings. However, there are currently no experimental
   data on the ability of ozone to penetrate through building envelopes and
   into residences. This paper presents a method to determine the
   penetration factor for ozone in buildings, and applies it in an
   unoccupied test house and seven single-family residences. The mean (+/-
   SD) ozone penetration factor was measured as 0.79 +/- 0.13 in the eight
   homes using this method, ranging from 0.62 +/- 0.09 to 1.02 +/- 0.15. An
   analysis of tests across the homes revealed that ozone penetration was
   significantly higher in homes with more painted wood envelope materials,
   homes with larger air leakage exponents from fan pressurization tests,
   and older homes. The test method utilizes a large calibrated fan to
   elevate air exchange rates and steady-state indoor ozone concentrations
   to levels that can be accurately measured, so there is a potential for
   overpredicting ozone penetration factors. However, evidence suggests
   that this bias is likely small in most of the homes, and, even if a bias
   exists, the measured ozone penetration factors were lower than the usual
   assumption of unity in seven of the eight tested homes.}},

Abstract = {{A series of carbon-supported core-shell nanoparticles with PdxCuy-rich
   cores and Pt-rich shells (Pt@PdxCuy/C) has been synthesized by a polyol
   reduction of the precursors followed by heat treatment to obtain the
   PdxCuy/C (1 <= x <= 3 and 0 <= y <= 5) cores and the galvanic
   displacement of PdxCuy with {[}PtCl4](2-) to form the Pt shell. The
   nanoparticles have also been investigated with respect to the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) in proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells
   (PEMFCs). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis suggests that the cores are
   highly alloyed and that the galvanic displacement results in a certain
   amount of alloying between Pt and the underlying PdxCuy alloy core.
   Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the Pt@PdxCuy/C
   catalysts (where y > 0) have mean particle sizes of <8 nm. Compositional
   analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) clearly shows Pt enrichment in the
   near-surface region of the nanoparticles. Cyclic voltammograms show a
   positive shift of as much as 40 mV for the onset of Pt-OH formation in
   the Pt@PdxCuy/C electrocatalysts compared to that in Pt/C. Rotating disk
   electrode (RDE) measurements of Pt@PdCu5/C show an increase in the Pt
   mass activity by 3.5-fold and noble metal activity by 2.5-fold compared
   to that of Pt/C. The activity enhancements in RDE and PEMFC measurements
   are believed to be a result of the delay in the onset of Pt-OH
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of managing flexible production
   capacity in a make-to-order (MTO) manufacturing environment. We present
   a multi-period capacity management model where we distinguish between
   process flexibility (the ability to produce multiple products on
   multiple production lines) and operational flexibility (the ability to
   dynamically change capacity allocations among different product families
   over time). For operational flexibility, we consider two polices: a
   fixed allocation policy where the capacity allocations are fixed
   throughout the planning horizon and a dynamic allocation policy where
   the capacity allocations change from period to period. The former
   approach is modeled as a single-stage stochastic program and solved
   using a cutting-plane method. The latter approach is modeled as a
   multi-stage stochastic program and a sampling-based decomposition method
   is presented to identify a feasible policy and assess the quality of
   that policy. A computational experiment quantifies the benefits of
   operational flexibility and demonstrates that it is most beneficial when
   the demand and capacity are well-balanced and the demand variability is
   high. Additionally, our results reveal that myopic operating policies
   may lead a firm to adopt more process flexibility and form denser
   flexibility configuration chains. That is, process flexibility may be
   over-valued in the literature since it is assumed that a firm will
   operate optimally after the process flexibility decision. We also show
   that the value of process flexibility increases with the number of
   periods in the planning horizon if an optimal operating policy is
   employed. This result is reversed if a myopic allocation policy is
   adopted instead. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   limitations in obtaining long-time trajectories in the diffusive regime

   studied the effect of fullerene nanoparticles upon the diffusivities of
   N-2 and CO2 in a polystyrene matrix. The addition of nanoparticles was
   found to cause a lowering of the diffusion coefficients of both N-2 and
   CO2. However, the magnitudes of this lowering and their volume fraction

   penetrant and temperature. We discuss the possible physical mechanisms

Abstract = {{Tumor growth and metastasis are ultimately mechanical processes
   involving cell migration and uncontrolled division. Using a 3D discrete
   model of cells, we show that increased compliance as observed for cancer
   cells causes them to grow at a much faster rate compared to surrounding
   healthy cells. We also show how changes in intercellular binding
   influence tumor malignancy and metastatic potential. These findings
   suggest that changes in the mechanical properties of cancer cells is the
   proximate cause of uncontrolled division and migration and various
   biochemical factors drive cancer progression via this mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Principal-oscillation-pattern (POP) analysis is a multivariate and
   systematic technique for identifying the dynamic characteristics of a
   system from time-series data. In this study, we demonstrate the first
   application of POP analysis to genome-wide time-series gene-expression
   data. We use POP analysis to infer oscillation patterns in gene
   expression. Typically, a genomic system matrix cannot be directly
   estimated because the number of genes is usually much larger than the
   number of time points in a genomic study. Thus, we first identify the
   POPs of the eigen-genomic system that consists of the first few
   significant eigengenes obtained by singular value decomposition. By
   using the linear relationship between eigengenes and genes, we then
   infer the POPs of the genes. Both simulation data and real-world data
   are used in this study to demonstrate the applicability of POP analysis
   to genomic data. We show that POP analysis not only compares favorably
   with experiments and existing computational methods, but that it also
   provides complementary information relative to other approaches.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{1, SI}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a robust fault detection and isolation system for
   nonlinear processes that can be formulated as differential algebraic
   equations. For open-loop stable or closed-loop stabilized systems that
   operate under strict nonlinear detectability conditions, a methodology
   to design a nonlinear state estimator based on sliding mode theory was
   proposed. The extended observer can handle both parameter estimation and
   parameters with uncertainties. As a result, the state estimator is able
   to follow the faulty system, detecting faults by examining changes in
   the controlled outputs with respect to setpoint and then probing
   variations in the parameters estimated. Once the fault has occurred, the
   isolation mechanism uses the information provided from the state
   estimator, generated from recovery actions in the presence of a fault.
   These differences from normal operation trends can be derived through
   statistical analysis and then can be used to identify faults. A steam
   generator system was used to validate this approach, where process
   faults were considered. The proposed robust fault detection and
   isolation method shows significant advantages when applied to nonlinear
   model systems with parameter uncertainties or with complex
   nonlinearities. The complex nonlinearities can be simplified with
   algebraic nonlinear functions that have bounded uncertainties in their
   parameters. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Classical molecular dynamics simulations point to an anisotropy of
   water-water hydrogen bonding at the water surface. Approaching from the
   gas phase, a region of primarily dangling hydrogens is followed by
   dangling oxygens before the isotropic bulk region. Using ab initio
   calculations, we translate this hydrogen bonding anisotropy to charge
   transfer between water molecules, which we analyze with respect to both
   instantaneous and averaged positions of the water surface. Similarly to
   the oil/water interface, we show that there is a region of small net
   negative charge extending 0.2 to 0.6 nm from the Gibbs dividing surface
   in the aqueous phase. Using a simple continuum model, we translate this
   charge profile to a zeta potential, which acquires for realistic
   positions of the shear surface the same negative sign as that observed
   experimentally, albeit of a smaller absolute value.}},

   23.4\%. Apart from using silver gratings, we show that patterning a 1D
   PC on top of the device may also result in a comparable broadband
   absorption enhancement of 18.9\%. The enhancement is due to light
   scattering of the 1D PC, coupling the incoming light into 1D PC Bloch

Abstract = {{The observability and estimability of collaborative opportunistic
   navigation (COpNav) environments are studied. A COpNav environment can
   be thought of as a radio frequency signal landscape within which one or
   more radio frequency receiver locate themselves in space and time by
   extracting and possibly sharing information from ambient signals of
   opportunity (SOPs). Available SOPs may have a fully-known,
   partially-known, or unknown characterization. In the present work, the
   receivers are assumed to draw only pseudorange-type measurements from
   the SOPs. Separate observations are fused to produce an estimate of each
   receiver's position, velocity, and time (PVT). Since not all SOP states
   in the COpNav environment may be known a priori, the receivers must
   estimate the unknown SOP states of interest simultaneously with their
   own PVT. This paper establishes the minimal conditions under which a
   COpNav environment consisting of multiple receivers and multiple SOPs is
   completely observable. In scenarios where the COpNav environment is not
   completely observable, the observable states, if any, are specified.
   Moreover, for the completely observable scenarios, the degree of
   observability, commonly referred to as estimability, of the various
   states is studied, with particular attention paid to the states with
   exceptionally good and poor observability.}},

Abstract = {{Test results are presented from over-the-air civil GPS spoofing tests
   from a non-negligible stand-off distance. These tests were performed at
   White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) against two systems dependent on civil
   GPS, a civilian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a GPS time-reference
   receiver used in ``smart grid{''} measurement devices. The tests against
   the civil UAV demonstrated that the UAV could be hijacked by a GPS
   spoofer by altering the UAV's perceived location. The tests against the
   time-reference receiver demonstrated the spoofer's capability of
   precisely controlling timing from a distance, which means a spoofer
   could manipulate measurements used for smart grid control without
   requiring physical access to the measurement devices. Implications of
   spoofing attacks against each of these systems are also given.
   Recommendations are presented for regulations regarding GPS receivers
   used in critical infrastructure applications. These recommendations
   include creating a certification process by which receivers are declared
   spoof-resistant if they are able to detect or mitigate spoofing attacks
   in a set of canned scenarios. The recommendations also call for a
   mandate that only spoof-resistant receivers be used in applications
   classified by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as national
   critical infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Multimode fibers (MMFs) are limited in data rate capabilities owing to
   modal dispersion. However, their large core diameter simplifies
   alignment and packaging, and makes them attractive for short and medium
   length links. Recent research has shown that the use of signal
   processing and techniques such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   can greatly improve the data rate capabilities of multimode fibers. In
   this paper, we review recent experimental work using MIMO and signal
   processing for multimode fibers, and the improvements in data rates
   achievable with these techniques. We then present models to design as
   well as simulate the performance benefits obtainable with arrays of
   lasers and detectors in conjunction with MIMO, using channel capacity as
   the metric to optimize. We also discuss some aspects related to
   complexity of the algorithms needed for signal processing and discuss
   techniques for low complexity implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum 5000-series alloy sheet materials exhibit substantial
   ductilities at hot and warm temperatures, even when grain size is not
   particularly fine. The relatively high strain-rate sensitivity exhibited
   by these non-superplastic materials, when deforming under solute-drag
   creep, is a primary contributor to large tensile ductilities. This
   active deformation mechanism influences both plastic flow and
   microstructure evolution across conditions of interest for hot- and
   warm-forming. Data are presented from uniaxial tensile and biaxial bulge
   tests of AA5182 sheet material at elevated temperatures. These data are
   used to construct a material constitutive model for plastic flow, which
   is applied in finite-element-method (FEM) simulations of plastic
   deformation under multiaxial stress states. Simulation results are
   directly compared against experimental data to explore the usefulness of
   this constitutive model. The effects of temperature and stress state on
   plastic response and microstructure evolution are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are particularly attractive as
   portable power sources because they use liquid methanol fuel which is
   easily manageable and has a high energy storage density. However, DMFCs
   present certain major challenges: the sluggish methanol oxidation
   reaction at the anode and oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode and
   methanol crossover through the membrane from the anode to the cathode,
   all of which lead to dramatic performance losses. The commercialization
   of DMFC has been hindered by these factors, as well as the high costs of
   the Pt-based catalyst and perfluorinated membrane currently used. This
   chapter, after outlining the fundamental aspects of DMFC operation,
   focuses on the design and developments of membranes, electrocatalysts,
   catalyst layer and membrane electrode assembly ( MEA) structure to
   address these technical challenges and reduce the cost.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic duty cycling, where a node's duty cycle is adapted according to
   observed context (e.g, local traffic, other nodes duty cycles), is
   commonly used by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to reduce energy
   consumption. Currently, duty cycles are assigned for every node in the
   network because it is assumed that all nodes are potential participants
   in transmissions. Receiver-based protocols, on the other hand, involve
   transmissions only among a subset of network nodes. Therefore, duty
   cycling may be limited to those nodes while the other nodes remain in an
   extended low-power state. In this work, we develop a duty cycle
   assignment algorithm for the nodes that participate in transmissions by
   employing two phases. First, nodes that participate in transmissions are
   selected and marked as ``heads.{''} Second, by acquiring information to
   estimate future network traffic, the heads are programmed to be awake
   only during incoming transmissions. Simulation evaluations show that
   they greatly improve energy efficiency without sacrificing packet
   delivery ratio or introducing delay compared with traditional methods
   for duty cycle assignment.}},

Abstract = {{We consider coordination in a multi-user multiple input single output
   cellular system. In contrast with existing base station cooperation
   methods that rely on sharing CSI with or without user data to manage
   interference, we propose to share user data only. We consider a system
   where blind interference alignment (BIA) is applied to serve multiple
   users in each cell. We apply interference coordination through data
   sharing to mitigate other-cell interference at the cell-edge users.
   While BIA mitigates intra-cell interference in MU-MISO systems, it does
   not address the problem of inter-cell interference. We apply
   interference coordination through data sharing to mitigate inter-cell
   interference at the cell-edge users. We propose a new cooperative BIA
   scheme that takes into account the users whose data is being shared
   between adjacent base stations. We derive the achievable sum rate with
   interference mitigation and we compare it to achievable rates with the
   original BIA strategy. Numerical results show that the achievable sum
   rate of the cell-edge users with data sharing decreases with increasing
   number of served users in each cell and increasing number of antennas at
   the base stations.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility modeling and analysis is a key issue in wireless networks. In
   this paper we propose a new and quite general random waypoint (RWP)
   mobility model which is valid over the entire plane. We derive key
   properties of the proposed mobility model including transition length,
   transition time and spatial node distribution. Then the RWP mobility
   model is applied to study the handover rate in cellular networks under
   both deterministic (hexagonal) and random (Poisson) base station (BS)
   models. Closed form expressions for handover rate can be obtained. These
   results show the expected property that the handover rate is
   proportional to the square root of base station density. Also, we find
   that Poisson-Voronoi model for BS coverage areas is about as accurate in
   terms of mobility (particularly handover) evaluation as the ubiquitous
   hexagonal model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses design and control of a prismatic series elastic
   actuator with high mechanical power output in a small and lightweight
   form factor. We introduce a design that pushes the performance boundary
   of electric series elastic actuators by using high motor voltage coupled
   with an efficient drivetrain to enable large continuous actuator force
   while retaining speed. Compact size is achieved through the use of a
   novel piston-style ball screw support mechanism and a concentrically
   placed compliant element. We develop controllers for force and position
   tracking based on combinations of PID, model-based, and disturbance
   observer control structures. Finally, we demonstrate our actuator's
   performance with a series of experiments designed to operate the
   actuator at the limits of its mechanical and control capability.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing the strength of binding between a molecule and a receptor is
   an important technique in the design of effective drugs. One
   experimental technique to increase the strength of binding (called
   ``binding affinity{''}) is to synthesize molecules that are already in
   the shape that it will take when bound to a receptor. This technique
   works because it decreases the binding entropy which increases the
   overall binding affinity. A recent experimental study of a series of
   receptor-molecule complexes (the Grb2 SH2 domain with peptide analogues)
   aimed to increase the binding affinity by introducing a bond constraint.
   However, the constrained molecules had less favorable binding entropies
   than their flexible counterparts. Yue Shi of the Ren lab at UT Austin
   aimed to probe the origin of this entropy paradox with molecular
   dynamics simulations which were run on Lonestar and Ranger at TACC.
   Their group used approximately 2 million CPU hours on Ranger and almost
   1 million on Lonestar this past year. Their research addresses
   biological and medical challenges from single molecules to the genome
   with high performance computing and theory. In collaboration with other
   experimental groups, they utilize computer modeling and simulations to
   understand these complex biomolecular systems and to discover molecules
   for treating disease and improving human health. Effectively
   communicating the results of their computational studies to
   experimentalists is essential to the success of their collaborative
   efforts. Anne Bowen of the Texas Advanced Computing Center collaborated
   with Yue Shi to prepare animations and graphics to better explain the
   origins of the ``entropy paradox{''} to experimentalists and the general
   public.}},

Abstract = {{Wrought magnesium alloys, such as AZ31 sheet, are of considerable
   interest for light-weighting of vehicle structural components. The poor
   room-temperature ductility of AZ31 sheet has been a hindrance to forming
   the complex part shapes necessary for practical applications. However,
   the outstanding formability of AZ31 sheet at elevated temperature
   provides an opportunity to overcome that problem. Complex demonstration
   components have already been produced at 450 degrees C using
   gas-pressure forming. Accurate simulations of such hot, gas-pressure
   forming will be required for the design and optimization exercises
   necessary if this technology is to be implemented commercially. We
   report on experiments and simulations used to construct the accurate
   material constitutive models necessary for finite-element-method
   simulations. In particular, the effects of strain and stress state on
   plastic deformation of AZ31 sheet at 450 degrees C are considered in
   material constitutive model development. Material models are validated
   against data from simple forming experiments.}},

   cycle analysis overlooks the relationship between a product's

   design, and usage variables. Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs)
   provide the capability of not only evaluating uncertainty and

   product's features and usage context. This discussion explores the use
   of PGMs as a tool for evaluating operational variability in products and
   including the results in life cycle inventories. The tool is illustrated
   for environmentally conscious product design through an example study of

Abstract = {{The United States uses approximately 5\% of its primary energy and 6\%
   of its electricity to pump, convey, treat, distribute, heat, and
   recondition water in the US public water supply. Allocating this energy
   towards water has contributed to a national public water distribution
   system that is considered among the best in the world, providing its
   users with a clean and reliable water supply. This water supply, treated
   to stringent water standards defined by the Environmental Protection
   Agency's Safe Drinking Water Act, has been critical to the health and
   livelihood of United States' citizens. However, this energy-expenditure
   comes at an environmental cost, since the majority of water-related
   energy is derived from burning fossil fuels. Fossil-fuel combustion
   emits carbon-dioxide, a greenhouse gas that has become of concern in
   recent years because of its connection to anthropogenic climate change.
   The amount of carbon-dioxide that is emitted from fossil-fuel combustion
   is principally a function of the quantity and type of fuel that is
   burned for energy.
   This first-order analysis quantifying national water-related carbon
   dioxide emissions is the second in a series of several analyses by the
   authors, quantifying the energy and greenhouse emissions embedded in the
   US public water supply. Results indicate that water withdrawal,
   conveyance, treatment, distribution, end-use preparation, and wastewater
   treatment produces approximately 301 million metric tonnes of CO2
   emissions annually. This quantity is 5.1\% of total US CO2 emissions in
   2009, which is approximately equal to emissions from the gasoline
   consumed by one-quarter of the US passenger fleet in the same year.
   Considering that the emissions associated with water for industrial,
   municipal and self-supplied sectors (such as agriculture) were not
   included in this analysis, the actual quantity of carbon emissions
   released as a result of water-related activities is likely to be higher.
   Consequently, identifying efficiency measures and conservation schemes
   to reduce the amount of water-related energy consumed in the US might be
   significant in achieving future greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.}},

Abstract = {{This experimental study reports the adhesion rate and adhesion density
   of Chlorella vulgaris on hydrophilic glass, and hydrophobic indium tin
   oxide (ITO) surfaces at constant shear rate. Cultivation of algae as
   biofilms offers an energy and water efficient method for algal biofuel
   production. In order to design algal biofilm cultivation systems, algal
   adhesion and biofilm formation on substrates with different surface
   properties must be known. To assess this, a parallel plate flow chamber
   was used to quantify the adhesion rate of the commonly used algae
   Chlorella vulgaris to the surfaces under controlled shear rates. The
   contact angle and zeta potential measurements were made both for the
   algal cells and the adhesion surfaces to model adhesion. The
   experimental results were compared with the predictions of the
   Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (DLVO), extended DLVO (XDLVO)
   theories, and the thermodynamic model. The experiments showed that the
   rate of adhesion over the hydrophobic surface was 81 cells mm(-2)min(-1)
   which was 3 times larger than that of the hydrophilic surface for the
   first forty minutes of the adhesion experiments. Moreover, the final
   adhesion density over the hydrophobic surface was 6182 mm(-2) after an
   experimental duration of 320 minutes which was 2.7 times that of the
   hydrophilic surface. Detachment studies done with increased shear rates
   showed that the adhesion strength of algae was also higher over the
   hydrophobic surface. The experimental results fit best with the results
   from the XDLVO theory. However, the model was inaccurate in predicting
   high detachment rate from the hydrophilic surface with increased shear
   rates. Results show the importance of surface material selection for the
   initial adhesion of cells. These results can be used for selection and
   design of surface materials for optimizing initial adhesion of algae
   cells in algal biofilm photobioreactors. Furthermore, the results can
   also be used for the design of planktonic photobioreactors to avoid
   biofouling.}},

   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wild strain and its truncated chlorophyll
   antenna transformant, t1a1, as a function of local irradiance. It is
   hypothesized that reduction in the pigmentation of algae cells can
   enhance light peneration in mass cultures and increase productivity.
   Thus, an experimental setup was designed to expose each cell within
   planktonic algae cultures to a nearly uniform irradiance. An oxygen
   microsensor was used to monitor the photosynthetic rate as the
   irradiance onto the sample was varied. The results showed that the
   cellular photosynthetic rate of the wild strain, CC125, was greater than
   that of t1a1 at all irradiances, by a factor that ranged from 1.7 to 4.
   Photoinhibition was observed in both strains, although the effect was
   more pronounced in CC125. Although less pigmented cells enable deeper
   light penetration in photobioreactors, their reduced phosotynthetic rate
   can negate this benefit.}},

Abstract = {{Recycling plastics is widely accepted as the most beneficial end use of
   plastic products. Consequently, many cities are turning towards
   single-stream recycling to make it easier for consumers to recycle and
   to increase the total amount of municipal solid waste (in particular,
   energy-dense plastic waste) that is diverted to recycling facilities.
   However, single-stream recycling Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs)
   are now faced with sorting more diverse material flows with increased
   contamination from the mixing of recyclable and non-recyclable
   materials, leading to roughly 5-10\% of the incoming material being sent
   to landfills. Converting the energy dense MRF waste material into solid
   recovery fuel (SRF) pellets creates an additional use for the products,
   diverts the material from the landfill, and displaces some fossil fuel
   use. However, there are some non-obvious energetic and environmental
   tradeoffs that require analysis to quantify. That is the intent of the
   research presented here. To analyze the potential of SRFs as viable
   alternative fuel sources, a first-order thermodynamic materials and
   energy balance was constructed using cement kilns as a test-bed. The
   proposed methodology allows for a range of traditional fuels to be
   compared with and without supplemental SRF. The SRF case can be
   benchmarked against the reference case, or conventional plastic
   end-of-life pathway, landfilling of the non-recycled plastic. The
   comparison includes transportation and processing steps required for
   each pathway, including any additional sorting needed for creating the
   SRF as well as the pelletization process itself. A robust methodology
   was created that allows for the MRF residue to be adjusted on a
   compositional basis because residue composition varies by season and
   location, which affects the analysis. Additionally, proximity to SRF
   conversion facilities and cement kilns will vary for each MRF and can
   impact the analysis so the methodology allows these factors to be
   adjusted. A test case was studied to compare the landfilling or
   combustion of MRF residue in a cement kiln at a rate of 0.9 metric tons
   per hour (7884 metric tons for a one year period). The analysis details
   the total energy consumed, landfill avoidance, amount of fuel displaced,
   and the total equivalent CO2 emissions of each scenario. The methodology
   successfully models the reference and SRF case and is robust enough to
   be used with a wide variety of potential SRF scenarios. A few parametric
   studies were performed on the transportation and landfill variables to
   determine their relative effect on results. It was found that additional
   transportation would have minimal effect of total energy consumption.
   When using SRF as a supplementary cement kiln fuel, the equivalent CO2
   reductions are higher in scenarios with low methane capture efficiency
   at the landfill. Overall, it was found that using SRF as a supplementary
   fuel at cement kilns reduces the total fossil energy consumption and
   total equivalent CO2 reductions by 6\% and 76\%, respectively.}},

   cooling. In contrast with traditional AC units and furnaces that use air
   outside of the house as a heat sink or source, GSHP systems use a ground
   loop heat exchanger to transfer heat to and from the soil where
   temperatures stay relatively constant throughout the year. GSHP systems
   operate more efficiently due to their use of the ground as a heat sink
   or source, whereas traditional AC units use the outside air.
   Consequently, GSHP systems typically use less energy than traditional
   HVAC units, but high capital costs have inhibited their widespread use.
   The monthly and annual energy costs for a home with a traditional AC
   unit-furnace are compared to a home with a GSHP system using hourly
   energy consumption data. The GSHP system modeled for the energy
   efficient home uses less energy (8.2 MMBtu) throughout the year compared
   to an efficient AC unit installed on the same home. Energy costs are
   lower using both the Austin Energy current rate schedule and for a
   proposed alternative schedule. Additionally, the GSHP system produces a
   net reduction in harmful emissions. Furthermore, GSHP systems reduce
   peak demand during the energy-intensive summer months, when air
   emissions are of greater concern.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the limits of light trapping for amorphous
   silicon thin film solar cells using surface metallic gratings. Adopting
   a method used recently by Sheng et al. {[}31], arbitrarily shaped
   periodic surface textures described by Fourier series with limited terms
   are considered, and global inverse optimization techniques such as
   Simulated Annealing are used to adjust the structural variations of the
   unknown texture to yield maximum light trapping. The optimization is
   done with respect to two objective functions: enhancement in the number
   of absorbed photons and, maximal spectral absorptivity enhancement. We
   show that compared with the rectangular structures previously studied,
   curved structures result in additional waveguide modes and more
   broadband enhancement in absorptivity of silicon. An overall improvement
   of over 60\% is achievable in the number of absorbed photons for
   polarized incident sunlight using the shape functions we will describe.
   We compare the results with conventional Lambertian limit of light
   trapping {[}1] and with the more recent theoretical limits of Yu et al.
   {[}30] and Sheng et al. {[}31] for thin films. We show that at
   near-infrared ranges, absorptivity enhancements remarkably higher than
   those results can be achieved using the proposed structures and inverse
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a numerical study on the thermal radiative transport
   in a cloud of dry water particles. Dry water is a water-in-air inverse
   foam which consists of micrometer-sized water droplets encapsulated by
   hydrophobic fumed-silica nanoparticles. The radiative properties of this
   novel material were estimated using the Mie theory for coated spheres.
   The radiative transport equation (RTE) was solved for a one-dimensional
   geometry using the discrete ordinates method. The effects of silica
   particle and water droplet size as well as the volume fraction of dry
   water particles on reducing radiative heat transfer were studied
   numerically. The results were compared with respect to two limiting
   cases: (i) system with no particles and (ii) silica particles with no
   water. The results showed that dry water reduced the local radiative
   heat flux as much as 20\% more than that by silica particles alone.
   Additionally, reduction of the diameter of dry water particles from 75
   to 25 mu m reduced the radiative heat flux by 17\%. Finally, parametric
   analysis showed that increasing the volume fraction of dry water by 10
   times decreased the radiative heat flux by about 30\% at the receiver
   end.}},

   processing that can be used to recover the biomass concentration of an

   biofuel or food supplement production. In particular, non-invasive and
   rapid detection techniques that can provide estimates of the biomass
   concentration can significantly aid in providing delay-free process
   control feedback in large scale cultivation platforms. In this
   technique, the digital images of the biofilms of the cyanobacteria
   Anabaena variabilis were obtained under consistent lighting conditions
   and analyzed as a function of their biomass content. The image analysis
   was carried out using a custom Matlab code where the red, green and blue
   content of the images were correlated with the biomass concentration.
   The obtained correlation was consistent across biofilms generated from
   different stock cultures of varying culture age. Challenges facing
   application of the image processing technique for scaled up outdoor
   photobioreactors under various lighting conditions and color backgrounds

Abstract = {{Disturbance of a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminated sediment;
   for example the loading-induced consolidation after placement of a
   sediment cap, may result in the release of the NAPL. Organophilic clays
   are reported as effective media in adsorbing NAPLs and organic
   contaminants. Consolidation tests were performed to evaluate the
   effectiveness of placement of an organophilic clay layer to capture any
   such displaced NAPL. NAPL contaminated specimens were tested in a
   modified triaxial setup under anisotropic loading conditions. Kaolinite
   was used to represent the sediment solid phase and Soltrol 130 (a type
   of mineral oil) was used to represent the NAPL. The tests with no
   organophilic clay showed that higher NAPL saturation resulted in a
   stiffer soil matrix, which reduced NAPL expulsion. The more organophilic
   clay was used, the less NAPL release was observed. For the conditions of
   this study, no NAPL breakthrough was observed, when the initial NAPL
   saturation of kaolinite was 28 \% with a layer of organophilic clay on
   top. The adsorption capacity of organophilic clay with this oil was
   approximated as 1.2 ml (0.93 g) per 1 g of organophilic clay solids.
   Organophilic clay reached its full adsorption capacity independent of
   the volume and rate of NAPL expulsion during consolidation. These data
   provide guidance to estimate the quantity of organophilic clay needed
   for site-specific applications.}},

Abstract = {{Using a silicon nitride cantilever with an integral Si tip and a
   micro-fabricated Pt-C resistance thermometer placed close to the tip, we
   have measured the thermal contact resistance of a nanoscale Si point
   contact in an ultrahigh vacuum atomic force microscope at near room
   temperature. The temperature of the cantilever tip was observed to
   remain constant during approach to, while in contact with, and during
   retraction from the Si substrate, while a large temperature drop was
   observed at the points of contact and separation, suggesting negligible
   near-field radiation transport in the experiment reported here. Detailed
   contact mechanics calculations of the contact diameter and modeling of
   the nanocontact show that solid-solid conduction with phonon
   transmission coefficient of at least 0.12 is the dominant mode of heat
   transfer through the nanoscale contact.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the rheological properties of the novel material
   ``dry water{''} which contains about 98\% by weight water but resembles
   a dry powder. Dry water is a water-in-air inverse foam which consists of
   microscopic water droplets encapsulated with hydrophobic fumed-silica
   nanoparticles. This novel material offers a large surface to volume
   ratio on the order of 2x10(5) m(2)/m(3) for the gas and water phases.
   Thus, it provides a convenient medium for surface area limited processes
   and finds applications from cosmetics to gaseous fuel storage. In this
   study both steady and dynamic rheological properties of dry water were
   measured. In particular, the elastic (G') and viscous (G `') moduli, and
   the complex dynamic shear viscosity (eta{*}) were recovered from
   experimental data. Results showed that both the elastic and viscous
   moduli decreased with increasing strain at strains larger than 4\%, and
   both moduli are weak functions of rotational frequency. Complex dynamic
   shear viscosity decreased with strain and rotational frequency. When
   compared with the studies in literature, rheological experiments and
   obtained results indicated that dry water behaves as a gel rheologically
   under the investigated conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This experimental study reports the steady and dynamic rheological
   properties of dense slurries of the green algae Chlorella vulgaris.
   Biofuel production from algae growth is a promising technology that has
   the potential to serve as a significant component of the world's revised
   energy mix. Along with providing a renewable fuel source, algae
   production acts as a CO2 sink, potentially reducing net CO2 emissions.
   Design and operation of algae biofuel production facilities require
   accurate knowledge of the flow characteristics of algae slurries and
   estimation of the pumping and harvesting energy requirements. Reliable
   rheological data is needed to optimize production processes to lower
   costs and increase yields. This study reports steady state viscosity
   measurements conducted using the ARES TA rotational rheometer using the
   common algae strain Chlorella vulgaris over the packing factor range
   from 0.1 to 0.8. Viscoelastic data was gathered using oscillatory tests
   conducted on the rotational rheometer with a double wall coquette
   fixture geometry. Dynamic frequency sweep tests were used to recover the
   storage shear modulus (G'), and the loss shear modulus (G `'), which
   correspond to the elastic and viscous properties of the fluid,
   respectively. Apparent viscosity of the cell suspensions increased with
   increasing packing factors. Packing factors lower than 0.3 exhibited
   Newtonian characteristics, whereas at larger packing factors the
   behavior was shear-thinning. The algae suspensions exhibited both
   viscous and elastic behavior when subjected to oscillatory flow,
   behaving as a dilute solution. Finally, the frequency of the gel point
   increased with increasing packing factor.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a design automation approach that combines various
   optimization research and artificial intelligence methods for
   synthesizing fluid networks. Unlike traditional software tools available
   today, this approach does not rely on having any predefined network
   topology to design and optimize its networks. PipeSynth generates its
   designs by using only desired port locations, and the desired fluid
   properties at each of those ports. An ideal network is found by
   optimizing the number and connectivity of pipes and pipe fittings, the
   size and length of each pipe, and the size and orientation of each
   fitting. A Uniform-Cost-Search is used for topology optimization along
   with a combination of non-gradient based optimization methods for
   parametric optimization. PipeSynth demonstrates how advances in
   automated design can enable engineers to manage much more complex fluid
   network problems. PipeSynth uses a unique representation of fluid
   networks that synthesizes and optimizes networks one pipe at a time, in
   three-dimensional space. PipeSynth has successfully solved several
   problems containing multiple interlaced networks concurrently with
   multiple inputs and outputs. PipeSynth shows the power of automated
   design and optimization in producing solutions more effectively and
   efficiently than traditional design approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Many factors must be addressed when designing infrastructure health
   monitoring systems. Structures in remote locations or with limited
   accessibility make the requirements for these systems unique and
   challenging. For locations where connection to the power grid is
   difficult or impossible, monitoring system life is severely limited by
   battery technology. Alternatively, an energy harvesting power supply can
   make the monitoring system independent of the grid while increasing
   capabilities and lifetime beyond what is possible with current battery
   technology. This paper discusses a design and development methodology
   for developing energy harvesting aspects of a health monitoring system.
   The system comprises a sensor module that monitors the health of the
   structure, an on-site processing module that analyzes the data, and a
   wireless communication module that transmits the data. The method is
   demonstrated by examples of energy harvesting systems for a bridge
   monitoring application, using solar, wind, and vibration energy
   harvesters to provide power to a wireless network, local data
   processors, and strain gauges. Theoretical feasibility of energy
   harvesting in these domains has been previously demonstrated. The
   examples described in this paper validate the feasibility previously
   calculated as well as illustrate shortcomings in the current technology
   that inhibit potential implementation. The examples also show areas
   where innovation is needed to continue to advance the technology of
   energy harvesting in this application on infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Complex design problems are typically decomposed into smaller design
   problems that are solved by domain-specific experts who must then
   coordinate their solutions into a satisfactory system-wide solution. In
   set-based collaborative design, collaborating engineers coordinate
   themselves by communicating multiple design alternatives at each step of
   the design process. Previous research has demonstrated that classifiers
   can be a communication medium for facilitating set-based collaborative
   design because of their ability to divide a design space into
   satisfactory and unsatisfactory regions. The proposed kernel-based
   Bayesian network (KBN) classifier uses a set of example designs of known
   acceptability, called the training set, to create a map of the
   satisfactory region of the design space. However, previous
   implementations used deterministic space-filling sampling sequences to
   choose the training set of designs. The shortcoming of deterministic
   space-filling sampling schemes is that they do not adapt to focus the
   samples on regions of interest to the design team (exploitation) or,
   alternatively, on regions in which little information is known
   (exploration). In this paper, we introduce the use of KBN classifiers as
   the basis for sequential sampling strategies that can be exploitive,
   exploratory, or any combination thereof.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting is a promising and evolving field of research capable
   of supplying power to systems in a broad range of applications. Energy
   harvesting encompasses many distinct technologies, including
   photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, kinetic motion harvesters, and
   thermal generators. Each technology utilizes different processes, to
   transform energy from the environment into usable electrical energy. As
   such, there are many analogous functions and processes that are common
   or similar across the various domains. To leverage and understand these
   functions and processes, functional modeling approaches are needed to
   identify these similarities and functions ripe for innovation in new
   systems.
   This paper describes a method for modeling the functional architectures
   of a sample set of energy harvesters, using a functional common basis
   from the literature. Vector space analysis is used to identify patterns
   and correlations in the use of functions across different products and
   energy-harvesting domains in the sample set. The resulting analysis
   indicates that systems in the same domain usually have very similar
   function structures, differing only by the addition or removal of a few
   driving or supporting functions. Systems in different domains also
   typically have similar structures, with the substitution of different
   material and energy flows into the system. A generalized functional
   model for energy harvesting is described, along with possible design
   ramifications and key opportunities to innovate. Several recommendations
   are given for the continued development and improvement of the
   functional common basis and, more generally, functional modeling
   methodologies. These include improved standardization and explanation of
   abstract functions, such as blending with the environment, and of
   organizational conventions to improve consistency.}},

Abstract = {{Well developed innovation processes are essential components for
   continued success of product and systems design throughout industry.
   Such processes build upon research advancements in innovation techniques
   and methods. To create such techniques and methods, studies are needed
   to examine the current state-of-the-art, as well as the corresponding
   teaching of such innovation processes in higher education. This paper
   contributes to this effort by studying a specific group of innovation
   researchers, teachers, and practitioners. The study was created to probe
   this group of leaders in the engineering design domain using technical,
   demographic, and short answer questions. Various analysis methods are
   used to obtain a fundamental view of the answers to these questions with
   respect to the demographics of the participant group. Two deductive
   analysis methods are used, in addition to an inductive approach,
   consisting of a correlation analysis to compare responses to questions
   and understand trends across the participants. Results from the analyses
   emphasize the current perceptions of innovation by the participants and
   opportunities to refine research in improving innovation practices.}},

Abstract = {{Universal Design (UD) is defined as the creation of products and
   environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent
   possible, without the need for adaptation or specialization. There is a
   growing need for such products. However, many products are not
   accessible to all potential customers, arguably due to a lack of
   experience, design tools, and engineering methods for creating
   universally designed products. Currently, there are no industry standard
   design tools or methods to assist engineers in the universal design of
   products. The Center for Universal Design (North Carolina State
   University; Raleigh, NC) has created the Universal Design Performance
   Measure for Products (UDPMP), based on the seven principles of universal
   design, which is intended to assist industrial designers. This paper
   reports on research to evaluate the applicability of the UDPMP for
   assisting engineers in the universal design of consumer products. An
   experiment was conducted in which a group of practicing engineers
   analyzed three standard kitchen products (can opener, salad spinner, and
   corkscrew) to identify metrics that should be improved to create a UD
   version of these standard products. Half of the engineers, the test
   group, completed this exercise using the UDPMP, while the other half,
   the control group, did not use the tool. The results of the experiment
   show that the UDPMP assisted the engineers in the test group for a
   limited subset of the universal design principles. In particular, the
   test group identified reduction in force for the user as an important
   metric for universally designed products. The metrics generated in the
   experiment were most commonly linked with principle six of the UDPMP
   tool, i.e., ``low physical effort.{''} The identified metrics were then
   physically measured for the standard products as well as for paired
   award-winning UD products to determine if the metrics were indeed
   improved in the UD product. Additionally, a comparison of functional
   models of the products was performed to identify any functional
   differences between each pair of standard and UD products. Improvement
   in metrics associated with low physical effort was verified for the UD
   products over the standard products, and added functionality was
   identified in the UD products that address these metrics. The research
   indicates that engineers who were given the UDPMP did generate more
   metrics that were improved in the UD versions of the products than
   engineers without the tool. While the UDPMP does assist engineers in
   certain aspects of UD design, it is clearly not a comprehensive tool for
   engineers. There is a need to develop tools and methods to promote UD by
   engineer designers of consumer products.}},

Abstract = {{In highly flexible and integrated manufacturing systems such as those in
   semiconductor manufacturing, there exist strong dynamic interactions
   between the equipment condition, operations executed on the equipment
   and the resulting product quality. These interactions necessitate a
   methodology that integrates the decisions of maintenance scheduling and
   production operations. Currently, maintenance and production operations
   decision-making are two decoupled processes. In this paper we aim to
   devise an integrated decision making policy for maintenance scheduling
   and production sequencing with the objective of maximizing an adaptive
   profit function, while taking. into account operation-dependent
   degradation models and a production target. In order to obtain the
   optimal decision policy, a metaheuristic method based on the results of
   discrete-event simulations of the target manufacturing system is used.
   The new approach is demonstrated in simulations of a generic cluster
   tool routinely used in semiconductor manufacturing. The results show
   that jointly making maintenance and production sequencing decisions
   consistently outperforms the current practice of making these decisions
   separately.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal conductivity of bilayer graphene (BLG) and few-layer
   graphene (FLG) samples supported on a silicon dioxide (SiO2) bridge has
   been measured in the temperature range between 80 K and 375 K. In the
   experiments, resistance heater and thermometer lines at the two ends of
   the bridge were used to implement steady-state thermal conductance
   measurements of the sample before and after the graphene on the bridge
   was etched away. The obtained thermal conductivity of the supported
   graphene increases and the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity
   decreases with increasing layer thickness. Compared to the reported
   thermal conductivity of suspended FLG samples, the opposite behavior
   observed here for the supported FLG reveals that interaction with the
   SiO2 support and also possibly polymer residue on top of the FLG sample
   suppresses the thermal conductivity of the supported FLG more than
   interlayer interaction within the FLG. The linear rise of thermal
   conductivity with layer number up to 8 layers suggests that the
   scattering effects due to substrate and polymer residue penetrates much
   more than 4 layers into a multilayer flake.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity analysis and design calculations are often best performed
   using low-order models. This work details work done on adding
   complementary pieces to a low-order, quasi-steady-state ablation model
   to facilitate uncertainty propagation. The quasi-steady-state ablation
   model is a one-dimensional, quasi-steady-state, algebraic ablation model
   that uses finite-rate surface chemistry and equilibrium
   pyrolysis-gas-production submodels to predict surface recession rate.
   The material response model is coupled to a film-transfer boundary layer
   model to enable the computation of heat and mass transfer from an
   ablating surface. For comparison to arc jet data, a simple shock heated
   gas model is coupled. A coupled model consisting of submodels for the
   shock heated gases, film heat and mass transfer, and material response
   is exercised against recession rate data for surface and in-depth
   ablators. Comparisons are made between the quasi-state-state ablation
   model and the unsteady ablation code, Chaleur, as well as to other
   computations for a graphite ablator in arcjet facilities. The simple
   models are found to compare reasonably well to both the experimental
   results and the other calculations. Uncertainty propagation using a
   moment based method is presented. The results of this study are
   discussed, and conclusions about the utility of the method as well as
   the properties of the ablation code are drawn.}},

Abstract = {{Intravenous injection of nanoparticles as drug delivery vehicles is a
   common practice used in in-vivo and clinical trials of therapeutic
   agents to target specific cancerous or pathogenic sites. The vascular
   flow dynamics of nanocarriers in human capillaries play an important
   role in the ultimate efficacy of this drug delivery method. This article
   reports an experimental study of the effect of nanoparticle size on
   their margination and adhesion propensity in micro fabricated
   microfluidic channels of a half elliptical cross-section. Spherical
   polystyrene particles ranging in diameter from 60 to 970 nm were flown
   in the microchannels and individual particles adhered to either the
   channel's top or bottom wall were imaged using fluorescence microscopy.
   The results show a significant increase in adhesion for particles with
   diameter below 200 nm as well as the emergence of a critical
   nanoparticle diameter of about 970 nm, where no nanoparticle adherence
   was observed on the top wall. For the same particle number
   concentration, the total volume of the nanoparticles adhered to the top
   and bottom walls was found to increase with decreasing diameter for
   diameters less than 200 nm. The results are explained by the competition
   between Brownian motion, gravity and hemodynamic forces on the
   nanoparticles. These findings on the flow behavior of spherical
   nanoparticles in artificial micro-capillaries provide further insight
   for the rational design of nanocarriers for targeted cancer
   therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, global optimization techniques are used to design
   broadband solar absorption enhancement in thin film amorphous silicon
   (a-Si) solar cells, using periodic nanostructures on the top and bottom
   surfaces of the cell. Considering a combination of silver rectangular
   gratings and indium tin oxide (ITO) coatings on both surfaces of the
   a-Si, numerical optimization techniques such as Simulated Annealing and
   a local constrained Quasi-Newton algorithm are used to optimize the
   surface texture patterns. Numerical results indicate that, unlike the
   case of metallic gratings on the front surface, a periodic silver
   grating structure on the back surface results in a modification of the
   absorption spectrum largely independent of the effect of anti-reflection
   ITO coatings on the front of the cell. Furthermore, additional
   improvement can be obtained by using a thin rear surface ITO layers.
   Therefore, using a combination of metallic gratings and ITO coatings on
   both sides, a wideband absorption spectrum enhancement is achievable.
   Simulations predict integrated enhancement factors as high as 2.0 (100\%
   improvement) for the case of metallic grating on the back surface and
   ITO layers on the front, and as high as 2.2 (120\% improvement) when a
   combination of grating and ITO coatings on both sides is used. Such
   noteworthy improvements are made possible by efficient multi-parameter
   optimization supplanting an intractable exhaustive search.}},

Abstract = {{Recent development of next-generation DNA sequencing platforms has
   dramatically increased the efficiency of sequencing genomes or targeted
   regions of interest within genomes. Identification of genetic variants
   is an important downstream application of such platforms. In this paper,
   we present a novel framework for processing short reads generated by
   next-generation sequencing platforms, and apply it to the problem of
   detecting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the target genome.
   The framework relies on a bipartite graphical model and message-passing
   techniques to unify the quality score recalibration and variant calling
   steps in the downstream data processing pipeline. This technique
   computes posteriori probabilities of the bases in the reconstructed
   sequence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique can
   improve the variant calling accuracy compared to broadly used
   alternative method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of a hybrid neural net and physics
   based battery model. A control oriented one dimensional physics based
   model of a battery is developed. A neural net based modeling approach is
   used to compensate for the lack of knowledge of material parameters for
   the battery cell. Given the knowledge of the physics of the battery,
   sparse recurrent neural nets are used. Multiple types of standalone
   neural nets as well as hybrid neural net and physics based battery
   models are developed and tested to determine the appropriate
   configuration for an optimal performance. All neural nets are trained as
   open-loop (feed-forward) systems and are tested as recurrent systems,
   with the battery state of charge being fed back The neural nets are
   trained, tested and validated using test data from a 4.4Ah Boston Power
   lithium ion battery cell. The modeling approach presented in this paper
   is able to accurately simulate battery performance for multiple current
   profiles.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an algorithm that predicts the best presentation of a stereo
   3D image in the sense of viewers' preference. The algorithm operates in
   three steps. First, the 3D image is classified as either a ``foreground
   dominant{''} or ``background dominant{''} image. Next, for ``foreground
   dominant{''} images, a model of the stereoacuity function is used to
   optimize the perceptual 3D resolution; for ``background dominant{''}
   images, the nearest surface is placed in the 3D plane of the display
   screen. A human study was conducted to assess the algorithm and showed
   that the proposed model produced 3D images which had the best 3D quality
   scores among several candidate algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Modern space situational awareness is focused on the detection,
   tracking, identification, and characterization of passive and active
   resident space objects. In the past, this process relied primarily on
   ground-based sensors. However, difficulties arise when smaller objects
   are considered, in the nano- or pico-satellite range for instance. To
   supplement ground sensing capabilities, a constellation of space based
   sensors is envisioned. In this study, concepts from computer graphics
   and numerical optimization are fused into a unique constellation design
   approach for space based space situational awareness applications.}},
