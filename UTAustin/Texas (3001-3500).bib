Title = {{Hybrid Electric Vehicle Ownership and Fuel Economy Across Texas An

Abstract = {{Policymakers, transport planners, automobile manufacturers, and others
   are interested in the factors that affect adoption rates of electric
   vehicles and other fuel-efficient vehicles. With tract-level data from
   the 2010 census and registered vehicle counts from Texas counties in
   2010, this study investigated the impact of various built environment
   and demographic attributes, including land use balance, employment
   density, population density, median age, gender, race, education,
   household size, and income. Spatial autocorrelation (across census
   tracts) in unobserved components of vehicle counts by tract and
   cross-response correlation (both spatial and local-aspatial in nature)
   was allowed for by the estimation of models of ownership levels (vehicle
   counts by vehicle type and fuel economy level) with bivariate and
   trivariate Poisson-lognormal conditional autoregressive models. The
   presence of high spatial autocorrelations and local cross-response
   correlations was consistent in all models across all counties studied.
   Ownership rates for fuel-efficient vehicles were found to rise with
   household income, resident education levels, and the share of male
   residents and to fall in the presence of larger household sizes and
   higher job densities. The average fuel economy of each tract's
   light-duty vehicles was also analyzed with a spatial error model across
   all Texas tracts, and this variable was found to depend most on
   educational attainment levels, median age, income, and household size
   variables, though all covariates used were statistically significant. If
   households registering more fuel-efficient vehicles, including hybrid
   electric vehicles, are also more inclined to purchase plug-in electric
   vehicles, these findings can assist in spatial planning of charging
   infrastructure as well as other calculations (such as implications for
   the revenue from gas tax).}},

   linearity in the presence of large DAC mismatches. A prototype ADC in
   1.30nm CMOS occupies only 0.04mm(2). It achieves 71dB SNDR over 1.7MHz

   Complementary mechanisms of circadian disruption and related diseases}},
Journal = {{CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{1029-1048}},
Abstract = {{Routine exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) in work, home, and
   community settings is linked with increased risk of breast and prostate
   cancer (BC, PC) in normally sighted women and men, the hypothesized
   biological rhythm mechanisms being frequent nocturnal melatonin
   synthesis suppression, circadian time structure (CTS) desynchronization,
   and sleep/wake cycle disruption with sleep deprivation. ALAN-induced
   perturbation of the CTS melatonin synchronizer signal is communicated
   maternally at the very onset of life and after birth via breast or
   artificial formula feedings. Nighttime use of personal computers, mobile
   phones, electronic tablets, televisions, and the like -now epidemic in
   adolescents and adults and highly prevalent in pre-school and
   school-aged children -is a new source of ALAN. However, ALAN exposure
   occurs concomitantly with almost complete absence of daytime sunlight,
   whose blue-violet (446-484 nm lambda) spectrum synchronizes the CTS and
   whose UV-B (290-315nm lambda) spectrum stimulates vitamin D synthesis.
   Under natural conditions and clear skies, day/night and annual cycles of
   UV-B irradiation drive corresponding periodicities in vitamin D
   synthesis and numerous bioprocesses regulated by active metabolites
   augment and strengthen the biological time structure. Vitamin D
   insufficiency and deficiency are widespread in children and adults in
   developed and developing countries as a consequence of inadequate
   sunlight exposure. Past epidemiologic studies have focused either on
   exposure to too little daytime UV-B or too much ALAN, respectively, on
   vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency or melatonin suppression in relation
   to risk of cancer and other, e. g., psychiatric, hypertensive, cardiac,
   and vascular, so-called, diseases of civilization. The observed elevated
   incidence of medical conditions the two are alleged to influence through
   many complementary bioprocesses of cells, tissues, and organs led us to
   examine effects of the totality of the artificial light environment in
   which humans reside today. Never have chronobiologic or epidemiologic
   investigations comprehensively researched the potentially deleterious
   consequences of the combination of suppressed vitamin D plus melatonin
   synthesis due to life in today's man-made artificial light environment,
   which in our opinion is long overdue.}},

Title = {{Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) as the reference standard
   for diagnosis of hypertension and assessment of vascular risk in adults}},
Journal = {{CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1329-1342}},
Abstract = {{New information has become available since the ISC, AAMCC, and SECAC
   released their first extensive guidedelines to improve the diagnosis and
   treatment of adult arterial hypertension. A critical assessment of
   evidence and a comparison of what international guidelines now propose
   are the basis for the following statements, which update the
   recommendations first issued in 2013. Office blood pressure (BP)
   measurements should no longer be considered to be the `` gold standard''
   for the diagnosis of hypertension and assessment of cardiovascular risk.
   Relying on office BP, even when supplemented with at-home wake-time
   self-measurements, to identify high-risk individuals, disregarding
   circadian BP patterning and asleep BP level, leads to potential
   misclassification of 50\% of all evaluated persons. Accordingly,
   ambulatory BP monitoring is the recommended reference standard for the
   diagnosis of true hypertension and accurate assessment of cardiovascular
   risk in all adults >= 18 yrs of age, regardless of whether office BP is
   normal or elevated. Asleep systolic BP mean is the most significant
   independent predictor of cardiovascular events. The sleep-time relative
   SBP decline adds prognostic value to the statistical model that already
   includes the asleep systolic BP mean and corrected for relevant
   confounding variables. Accordingly, the asleep systolic BP mean is the
   recommended protocol to diagnose hypertension, assess cardiovascular
   risk, and predict cardiovascular eventfree interval. In men, and in the
   absence of compelling clinical conditions, reference thresholds for
   diagnosing hypertension are 120/70mmHg for the asleep systolic/diastolic
   BP means derived from ambulatory BP monitoring. However, in women, in
   the absence of complicating co-morbidities, the same thresholds are
   lower by 10/5 mmHg, i. e., 110/65mmHg for the asleep means. In high-risk
   patients, including those diagnosed with diabetes or chronic kidney
   disease, and/or those having experienced past cardiovascular events, the
   thresholds are even lower by 15/10 mmHg, i. e., 105/60 mmHg. Bedtime
   treatment with the full daily dose of >= 1 hypertension medications is
   recommended as a cost-effective means to improve the management of
   hypertension and reduce hypertension-associated risk. Bedtime treatment
   entailing the full daily dose of >= 1 conventional hypertension
   medications must be the therapeutic regimen of choice for the elderly
   and those with diabetes, resistant and secondary hypertension, chronic
   kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and medical history of past
   cardiovascular events, among others, given their documented high
   prevalence of sleep-time hypertension.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1954-1963}},
Abstract = {{Seismic loads on bridges may cause large damaging forces in
   substructure. Isolation and energy dissipating elements or a combination
   of the two have been used to reduce the transmitted forces caused by
   seismic loading. The benefits of these systems are mainly attributed to
   the increase of structure's natural period of vibration and damping.
   This paper investigates a new device that works on the same principles.
   This device is composed of sliding bearings and air springs or airbags.
   Several bridges are analyzed using the Nishimura's model for air
   springs; and the sensitivity of seismic response of bridges due to
   variable spring parameters is investigated and optimum values are
   obtained. Then, using these parameters for the air spring and solving
   the equation of motion, the variation of air spring internal parameters
   with time are investigated. Results show that air springs are very
   efficient in reducing the effects of seismic forces. (C) 2015 Sharif

Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{35-44}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is maturing, and AVs are being
   test-driven on public roads. A promising intersection control policy,
   tile-based reservation (TBR), proposed by Dresner and Stone in 2004,
   could improve intersection capacity beyond the capabilities of optimized
   traffic signals. Although TBR has been studied in several
   microsimulation models, it has yet to be analyzed under user equilibrium
   behavior. In this study, TBR was modeled in the dynamic traffic
   assignment to draw on the extensive literature on vehicle routing
   behaviors. With the proposed model, TBR can be computationally simulated
   on large city networks, with the goal of solving the traffic assignment
   problem. TBR also arbitrarily prioritizes vehicle movement, and
   high-value-of-time travelers may be able to gain priority through
   intersection auctions, as suggested by the literature. An in-depth study
   of simple intersection auctions found that much of the benefit (over
   first-come, first-served prioritization) resulted from the randomizing
   effect of auctions giving larger queues of vehicles greater shares of
   the intersection capacity.}},

Abstract = {{A panel method is applied to predict the performance of tip loaded
   propeller with and without cavitation modeling. For fully wetted cases,
   the geometry of the wake is shown to be critical to the computational
   accuracy. To align the wake surface, two methods are proposed and the
   full wake alignment scheme behaves better then PSF2 alignment. The
   boundary layer correction can also improve the pressure distribution
   especially near the trailing edge region. Finally, for cavitating cases,
   the results based on full wake alignment tend to create larger
   cavitation region and higher cavitation thickness compared to results
   based on PSF2 alignment.}},

Title = {{Novel Utility-Based Methodological Framework for Valuation of Road
   Infrastructure}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2529}},
Pages = {{37-45}},
Abstract = {{Transportation infrastructure assets are the largest publicly owned
   infrastructure assets in the United States. The management of these
   assets and the determination of their value have been at the forefront
   of discussions in many state agencies and local governments. However,
   existing valuation approaches are mostly based on physical condition and
   neglect the effect of factors such as functionality and overall use on
   the asset's value. This paper presents a utility-based methodological
   framework for the valuation of transportation infrastructure. The
   proposed valuation methodology uses the asset replacement cost as the
   base value. Value is then added to the base value by considering three
   key factors associated with the infrastructure: physical condition,
   functionality, and overall asset use. Each factor is characterized by
   appropriate indicators that can be quantified with specific performance
   measures. Then, the utility theory is applied to combine the effect of
   performance indicators of varying measures and scales on the value of an
   asset. The proposed framework can assist state and local transportation
   agencies in optimizing their resource allocation procedures for better
   coordination of asset investments within or across infrastructure
   assets.}},

Title = {{Approach to Classifying Freight Data Elements Across Multiple Data
   Sources}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2529}},
Pages = {{56-65}},
Abstract = {{Multiple freight data sources, both public and private, are available to
   practitioners for understanding freight demand and evaluating current
   and future freight transportation capacity. The challenge of working
   with multiple data sources is dealing with the syntactic and semantic
   heterogeneity in these sources. To assist practitioners in addressing
   this challenge, a unified perspective from which data elements from
   multiple sources can be examined is proposed. The role-based
   classification schema (RBCS) organizes and classifies data elements
   within their respective parent databases such that similar data elements
   across multiple sources can be grouped. RBCS is based on two levels of
   classification: a primary group that characterizes data elements
   according to the type of object that they describe and a secondary group
   that differentiates between elements that identify objects and those
   that describe features related to the objects. When similar data
   elements are ascertained, the subsequent process of resolving syntactic
   and semantic heterogeneity becomes much clearer, especially with
   hundreds of data elements. The proposed schema was validated by
   classifying 1,624 data elements from 28 freight data sources, and it was
   compared with the existing mnemonic CODMRT, which defined key attributes
   of freight-related shipments: commodity, origin, destination, mode,
   route, and time. Examples of applications in the areas of data bridging
   and multidatabase querying are also presented.}},

Title = {{Welfare Analysis Using Logsum Differences Versus Rule of Half Series of
   Case Studies}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2530}},
Pages = {{73-83}},
Abstract = {{Logsum differences and rule-of-half (ROH) calculations are two methods
   for estimating consumer surplus in transport economics. As a traditional
   and relatively straightforward (and potentially more robust) procedure,
   ROH is widely used in project investment and policy analysis, and much
   of the literature agrees that logsums are somewhat superior to ROH when
   user benefits are valued, at least when true travel behaviors stem from
   random-utility maximization with Gumbel error terms. This paper explores
   the differences in both methods through a careful review of literature
   and many case study results. The comparison of ROH and logsum methods
   relies on three specifications in order of increasing complexity: binary
   logit, multinomial logit, and nested logit models under a variety of
   settings and scenarios. This work offers a closer look at three
   numerical examples and concludes that the difference between ROH and
   logsum solutions rises with increases in travel times or costs and with
   changes in parameters. The monetized differences in logsums is usually
   smaller than the ROH solution for welfare changes under most situations
   and gives a more exact result for consumer surplus than ROH (which
   assumes a linear demand relationship with respect to cost). Larger
   coefficients on affected variables (such as travel time and cost) in the
   random-utility expressions tend to increase differences between logsum-
   and ROH-based estimates. Such findings should be of interest to policy
   makers and planners when they are developing transportation planning and
   land use models and interpreting their results for more accurate and
   rigorous and behaviorally defensible project evaluations.}},

Journal = {{CRYOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{2429-2446}},
Abstract = {{A glacial flow model of Smith, Pope and Kohler Glaciers is calibrated by
   means of control methods against time varying, annually resolved
   observations of ice height and velocities, covering the period 2002 to
   2011. The inversion - termed ``transient calibration{''} - produces an
   optimal set of time-mean, spatially varying parameters together with a
   time-evolving state that accounts for the transient nature of
   observations and the model dynamics. Serving as an optimal initial
   condition, the estimated state for 2011 is used, with no additional
   forcing, for predicting grounded ice volume loss and grounding line
   retreat over the ensuing 30 years. The transiently calibrated model
   predicts a near-steady loss of grounded ice volume of approximately 21
   km(3) a(-1) over this period, as well as loss of 33 km(2) a(-1) grounded
   area. We contrast this prediction with one obtained following a commonly
   used ``snapshot{''} or steady-state inversion, which does not consider
   time dependence and assumes all observations to be contemporaneous.
   Transient calibration is shown to achieve a better fit with observations
   of thinning and grounding line retreat histories, and yields a
   quantitatively different projection with respect to ice volume loss and
   ungrounding. Sensitivity studies suggest large near-future levels of
   unforced, i.e., committed sea level contribution from these ice streams
   under reasonable assumptions regarding uncertainties of the unknown
   parameters.}},

   3.2, 2.1, 1.4, and 1.4 h, respectively. The preexposed fish showed a
   poorer tolerance to TDG-supersaturated water than did a control group
   that were not preexposed for TDG above 120\% supersaturation (P < 0.05
   in cases where there was a significant difference between individual
   groups). Experiments on horizontal behavior and vertical behavior used
   the same preexposure routine, followed by 5 d of recovery in
   saturated-equilibrium water. For all behavior experiments, both the
   preexposed and control groups showed significant avoidance responses to
   TDG-supersaturated water; however, there were no significant differences
   between the preexposed and control groups.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonic nanoparticles with sizes well below 100 nm and high near
   infrared ( NIR) extinction are of great interest in biomedical imaging.
   Herein we present similar to 60 nm Au nanoparticles with high NIR
   absorbance at wavelengths ranging from 700 nm to 1100 nm, which were
   synthesized under kinetic control. A high surface density of
   protuberances is grown on similar to 30 nm nanocluster cores, which are
   composed of similar to 10 nm primary particles. The high NIR extinction
   is produced by a combination of the close proximity of the primary
   particles in the cores, the high surface density of protuberances, and
   the high aspect ratio of the length of the protuberances to the diameter
   of the primary particles. When the Au precursor was reduced more slowly
   at a higher pH of 9.3, the growth was thermodynamically controlled and
   the nanocluster cores relaxed to spheres. This concept of self-assembly
   during reaction to change the morphology of nanoclusters and decorated
   nanoclusters, may be expected to be applicable to a wide variety of
   systems by balancing kinetic and thermodynamic control, along with the
   colloidal interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In the Bayesian approach to inverse problems, data are often
   informative, relative to the prior, only on a low-dimensional subspace
   of the parameter space. Significant computational savings can be
   achieved by using this subspace to characterize and approximate the
   posterior distribution of the parameters. We first investigate
   approximation of the posterior covariance matrix as a low-rank update of
   the prior covariance matrix. We prove optimality of a particular update,
   based on the leading eigendirections of the matrix pencil defined by the
   Hessian of the negative log-likelihood and the prior precision, for a
   broad class of loss functions. This class includes the Forstner metric
   for symmetric positive definite matrices, as well as the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance between the
   associated distributions. We also propose two fast approximations of the
   posterior mean and prove their optimality with respect to a weighted
   Bayes risk under squared-error loss. These approximations are deployed
   in an offline-online manner, where a more costly but data-independent
   offline calculation is followed by fast online evaluations. As a result,
   these approximations are particularly useful when repeated posterior
   mean evaluations are required for multiple data sets. We demonstrate our
   theoretical results with several numerical examples, including
   high-dimensional X-ray tomography and an inverse heat conduction
   problem. In both of these examples, the intrinsic low-dimensional
   structure of the inference problem can be exploited while producing
   results that are essentially indistinguishable from solutions computed
   in the full space.}},

Title = {{SOLUTION OF NONLINEAR STOKES EQUATIONS DISCRETIZED BY HIGH-ORDER FINITE
   ELEMENTS ON NONCONFORMING AND ANISOTROPIC MESHES, WITH APPLICATION TO
   ICE SHEET DYNAMICS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{B804-B833}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the need for efficient and accurate simulation of the
   dynamics of the polar ice sheets, we design high-order finite element
   discretizations and scalable solvers for the solution of nonlinear
   incompressible Stokes equations. In particular, we focus on power-law,
   shear thinning rheologies commonly used in modeling ice dynamics and
   other geophysical flows. We use nonconforming hexahedral meshes and the
   conforming inf-sup stable finite element velocity-pressure pairings Q(k)
   x Q(disc)(k-2) or Q(k) x P-k-1(disc), where k >= 2 is the polynomial
   order of the velocity space. To solve the nonlinear equations, we
   propose a Newton-Krylov method with a block upper triangular
   preconditioner for the linearized Stokes systems. The diagonal blocks of
   this preconditioner are sparse approximations of the (1,1)-block and of
   its Schur complement. The (1,1)-block is approximated using linear
   finite elements based on the nodes of the high-order discretization, and
   the application of its inverse is approximated using algebraic multigrid
   with an incomplete factorization smoother. This preconditioner is
   designed to be efficient on anisotropic meshes, which are necessary to
   match the high aspect ratio domains typical for ice sheets. As part of
   this work, we develop and make available extensions to two libraries-a
   hybrid meshing scheme for the p4est parallel adaptive mesh refinement
   library and a modified smoothed aggregation scheme for PETSc-to improve
   their support for solving PDEs in high aspect ratio domains. In a
   comprehensive numerical study, we find that our solver yields fast
   convergence that is independent of the element aspect ratio, the
   occurrence of nonconforming interfaces, and the mesh refinement and that
   depends only weakly on the polynomial finite element order. We simulate
   the ice flow in a realistic description of the Antarctic ice sheet
   derived from field data and study the parallel scalability of our solver
   for problems with up to 383 million unknowns.}},

   Widening Projects in Texas}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2515}},
Pages = {{63-69}},
Abstract = {{Texas has approximately 40,000 lane miles (64,000 lane kilometers) of
   two-lane farm-to-market (FM) and ranch-to-market (EM) roads with total
   paved widths of 18 to 22 ft (5.5 to 6.7 m), most of which are in rural
   areas. Narrow pavement widening in Texas typically involves adding lane
   width, a narrow shoulder, or both to increase the travel way in each
   direction of a narrow FM and EM road by 1 to 9 ft (0.3 to 2.7 m). The
   main reasons for roadway widening are usually to do any or all of the
   following: improve safety, increase structural capacity, and enhance
   pavement performance. The goal of this study was to investigate the
   safety effects of narrow pavement widening projects for rural two-lane
   FM and EM roads in Texas. A before-after comparison study was conducted
   with the empirical Bayes method to evaluate how wider lanes and
   shoulders affect crash occurrence, by type and severity. Of the 22
   studied projects, analysis showed a 31.5\% reduction in total crashes, a
   35.7\% reduction in run-off-the-road crashes, and a 55.4\% reduction in
   head-on crashes after narrow widening projects were carried out. The
   projects were also effective in reducing fatal crashes and injuries by
   about 29.5\%. These findings suggest that pavement widening is an
   effective safety countermeasure on narrow two-lane FM and EM roads in
   rural areas.}},

Title = {{Wetting Characteristics of Asphalt Binders at Mixing Temperatures}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2505}},
Pages = {{66-75}},
Abstract = {{Conventional hot-mix asphalt is produced by heating the aggregate and
   the asphalt binder to elevated temperatures, typically within the range
   of 140 degrees C to 170 degrees C. These temperatures ensure that the
   viscosity of the asphalt binder is low enough to coat the aggregate
   particles effectively. During the past decade, warm-mix asphalt (WMA)
   technology has been introduced to reduce the mixing temperatures by
   approximately 30 degrees C compared with hot-mix asphalt. Workability at
   these reduced temperatures typically is achieved by the use of chemical
   additives in the asphalt binder or through the foaming of the asphalt
   binder with small percentages of water. In either case (i.e., WMA or
   hot-mix asphalt), one of the important physical properties that dictates
   the quality of coating and concomitant aggregate binder bonding is the
   surface tension of the asphalt binder at mixing temperatures. In this
   study, the surface tension of different liquid asphalt binders was
   measured at typical mixing temperatures. The influence on the surface
   tension of binder type, temperature, and chemical additives used to
   produce WMA was evaluated. The results showed that the surface tension
   of asphalt binder depended on the rate of surface formation,
   temperature, and the source of the asphalt binder. The dynamic surface
   tension of the asphalt binders suggested that inherently they behaved
   similarly to surfactants. This observation lent indirect support to the
   theory that different molecular species tended to agglomerate within the
   binder, which rendered the binder microstructurally heterogeneous. Only
   one of the chemical additives resulted in a significant reduction in the
   surface tension of the binder compared with the control.}},

   Asphalt Foaming Characteristics}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{76-83}},
Abstract = {{Warm-mix asphalt (WMA) produced by foaming is widely used in the asphalt
   paving industry and is the largest segment of the WMA market in the
   United States. To produce foaming, a small quantity of cold water is
   injected into hot asphalt to cause a reduction in the asphalt viscosity
   and improve the coating of the aggregate particles. The primary
   objectives of the study reported here were to compare the foaming
   characteristics of asphalts of different sources and grades and to
   evaluate the effect of certain additives on the characteristics of the
   foamed asphalt. To characterize the foamed asphalt, a laser distance
   meter (LDM) was used in the laboratory. The LDM was used as an
   alternative to the dipstick (traditionally used in foaming measurements)
   because of its better repeatability and accuracy. The LDM results
   indicated that the foaming characteristics depended on the source and
   performance grade of the asphalt. The addition of a foaming-enhancing
   additive had a significant effect on the foaming characteristics of most
   asphalt. However, no obvious difference in foaming characteristics was
   observed when warm-mix additives were used as part of the foaming
   process.}},

   temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that offer technical and
   economical benefits, materials research in the area of SOFC cathodes is
   being directed toward mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) oxides
   with perovskite or related structures due to their promising
   performances particularly at reduced temperatures (T < 800 degrees C).
   This article focuses on the recent progress in the A-site ordered,
   layered LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta) perovskite family of MIECs that have been
   most actively investigated in the last decade. While significant
   progress has been made in understanding the promising cathode activity
   of LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta), much efforts are being put towards further
   fine-tuning their properties by exploring their derivative chemical
   compositions and optimizing microstructures via advanced cathode
   fabrication processes. Based on the literature data, an overview of the
   structure-composition-property-performance relationships of the
   LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta)-based layered perovskite family is presented here.
   The challenges and perspectives of the LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta)-based
   cathodes are also discussed in relation to the conventional perovskite
   oxide cathodes.}},

Abstract = {{Solid electrolytes may be used where the electrode reactants are gaseous
   as in a rechargeable oxide fuel cell or are liquids as in a cell of a

   battery, or (iii) in contact with an alkali-metal anode on one side and
   a liquid electrolyte on the other side. A solid-electrolyte interface
   with the anode would also block from reaching the anode soluble
   intermediate species of a solid-sulfur cathode reaction in a liquid
   catholyte. We discuss strategies for realizing the different strategies

Abstract = {{Platinum-cobalt alloy nanoparticles are of great interest as cathode
   catalysts for PEMFCs as they have been shown to have enhanced activity
   versus platinum. However, their relative stability against loss of
   electrochemically-active surface area in relation to Pt catalysts is
   still debated. In this study, the evolutions of Pt3Co particle size
   distributions (PSDs) in fuel cell and aqueous environments were followed
   during accelerated stress tests (ASTs) using in-operando ASAXS. The
   measured evolutions showed a degradation mechanism dominated by loss of
   particles smaller than the critical particle diameter (<5.2 to 6.1 nm,
   CPD), which depended on environment and the AST. These evolutions were
   compared to that of a Pt catalyst with a similar initial PSD, which was
   found to have a lower degradation rate than Pt3Co. The ASAXS data, as
   well as data from aqueous dissolution, X-ray absorption spectroscopy,
   individual particle energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence
   spectrometry, and kinetic Monte Carlo calculations support a loss
   mechanism of increased Pt dissolution from Pt3Co versus Pt due to
   destabilization caused by extensive dealloying of particles <similar to
   5 nm during ASTs. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS. This is an

Pages = {{20391-20396}},
Abstract = {{Moire nanosphere lithography (MNSL), which features the relative
   in-plane rotation between two layers of self-assembled monodisperse
   nanospheres as masks, provides a cost-effective approach for creating
   moire patterns on generic substrates. In this work, we experimentally
   and numerically investigate a series of moire metasurfaces by MNSL. Due
   to the variety of gradient plasmonic nanostructures in arrays, single
   moire metasurfaces can support multiple localized surface plasmon (LSP)
   modes with a wide range of resonant wavelengths from similar to 600 nm
   to similar to 4200 nm. We analyze the origin of the LSP modes based on
   the optical spectra and near-field electromagnetic distributions. In
   addition, we fabricate and analyze the metasurfaces with high-density
   nanogap structures. These nanogap structures support plasmonic gap modes
   with significant field enhancements. With their tunable multiband
   optical responses from visible to near-infrared to mid-infrared regimes,
   these moire metasurfaces are applicable for ultrabroadband absorbers,
   multiband surface-enhanced infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and
   broad-band single-molecule spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel, is of key importance to various
   industrial applications, including fuel cells and in the aerospace and
   automotive industries. However, hydrogen gas is odorless, colorless, and
   highly flammable; thus appropriate safety protocol implementation and
   monitoring are essential. Highly sensitive hydrogen leak detection and
   surveillance sensor systems are needed; additionally, the ability to
   maintain uniformity through repetitive hydrogen sensing is becoming
   increasingly important. In this report, we detail the fabrication of
   porous palladium coated conducting polymer (3-carboxylate polypyrrole)
   nanoparticles (Pd@CPPys) to detect hydrogen gas. The Pd@CPPys are
   produced by means of facile alkyl functionalization and chemical
   reduction of a pristine 3-carboxylate polypyrrole nanoparticle-contained
   palladium precursor (PdCl2) solution. The resulting Pd@CPPy-based sensor
   electrode exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity (0.1 ppm) and stability toward
   hydrogen gas at room temperature due to the palladium sensing layer.}},

   electromagnetically-engineered plasmonic elements we may produce
   ultrathin metasurfaces with giant nonlinear response. Here we
   experimentally demonstrate metasurfaces designed for second harmonic
   generation at lambda approximate to 9.9 mu m with a record-high
   nonlinear response for condensed-matter systems in infrared/visible
   spectral range, up to 1.17 x 10(6) pm/V. The practical impact of the

Abstract = {{Environmental context Chirally enriched semiconducting single-walled
   carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are some of the most utilised nanomaterials.
   Although chirality of SWNTs is known to influence their electronic
   properties and interfacial interaction, the interplay between chirality
   and surfactant structure in SWNT stability is not well understood. This
   study investigates these interactions, providing data to better assess
   the environmental fate of SWNTs.
   Abstract Single-walled carbon nanotubes' (SWNT) effectiveness in
   applications is enhanced by debundling or stabilisation. Anionic
   surfactants are known to effectively stabilise SWNTs. However, the role
   of specific chirality on surfactant-stabilised SWNT aggregation has not
   been studied to date. The aggregation behaviour of chirally enriched

   and sodium deoxycholate - was evaluated with time-resolved dynamic light
   scattering. A wide range of mono- (NaCl) and divalent (CaCl2)
   electrolytes as well as a 2.5mg total organic carbon (TOC) L-1 Suwannee
   River humic acid were used as background chemistry. Overall, sodium
   dodecyl benzene sulfonate showed the most effectiveness in stabilising
   SWNTs, followed by sodium deoxycholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate.
   However, the larger diameter (7,6) chirality tubes (compared to (6,5)
   diameter), compromised the surfactant stability due to enhanced van der
   Waals interaction. The presence of divalent electrolytes overshadowed
   the chirality effects and resulted in similar aggregation behaviour for
   both the SWNT samples. Molecular modelling results elucidated key
   differences in surfactant conformation on SWNT surfaces and identified
   interaction energy changes between the two chiralities to delineate
   aggregation mechanisms. The stability of SWNTs increased in the presence
   of Suwannee River humic acid under 10mM monovalent and mixed-electrolyte
   conditions. The results suggest that change in chirality can overcome
   surfactant stabilisation of semiconducting SWNTs. SWNT stability can
   also be strongly influenced by the anionic surfactant structure.}},

Abstract = {{Mainstream rechargeable lithium battery materials research of the past
   20 years has focused on nano-particulate materials, where Li+-diffusion
   lengths exceeded at designated cycling rates the particle radii, and
   where the particles slipped rather than broke upon their expansion and
   shrinkage in lithiation/delithiation cycles. Here we show that in
   intrinsically rapidly Li+-transporting macrocrystalline germanium and
   even more so in a dispersion of non-cycling Li2Te in macrocrystalline
   germanium it is unnecessary to use nanocrystalline materials and that
   Li2Te increases the retained capacity at 1C rate after 500 cycles. A
   dispersion of 17.65 atom\% of crystalline GeTe in 82.35 atom\%
   crystalline Ge was synthesized by quenching from the melt followed by
   high energy ball milling to 1 mu m-5 mu m particle size. The particles,
   as well as similarly made and similarly sized pure Ge particles were
   incorporated in electrodes, which were galvanostatically
   lithiated/delithiated. In the initial cycle, GeTe is reduced to LixGe
   alloys and Li2Te. In 500 1C cycles of LixGe delithiation/Ge lithiation
   the capacity of the pure Ge faded more rapidly than that of the Ge
   electrodes containing Li2Te, which retained 96\% of their initial
   capacity after 500 cycles at 1C rate.}},

Abstract = {{Real space pseudopotentials have a number of advantages in solving for
   the electronic structure of materials. These advantages include ease of
   implementation, implementation on highly parallel systems, and great
   flexibility for describing partially periodic systems. One limitation of
   this approach, shared by other electronic structure methods, is the slow
   convergence of interatomic forces when compared to total energies. For
   real space methods, this requires a fine grid to converge a solution of
   the Kohn-Sham problem, which is accompanied by concurrent increase in
   memory and additional matrix-vector multiplications. Here we introduce a
   method to expedite the computation of interatomic forces by employing a
   high order integration technique. We demonstrate the usefulness of this
   technique by calculating accurate bond lengths and vibrational
   frequencies for molecules and nanocrystals without using fine real space
   grids.}},

Abstract = {{Nanosphere lithography (NSL) uses self-assembled layers of monodisperse
   micro-/nano-spheres as masks to fabricate plasmonic metal nanoparticles.
   Different variants of NSL have been proposed with the combination with
   dry etching and/or angled-deposition. These techniques have employed to
   fabricate a wide variety of plasmonic nanoparticles or nanostmctures.
   Here we report another promising extension - moire nanosphere
   lithography (MNSL), which incorporates in-plane twisting between
   neighboring monolayers, to extend the patterning capability of
   conventional NSL. In conventional NSL, the masks, either a monolayer or
   bilayer, are formed by spontaneous self-assembly. Therefore, the
   resulted colloidal crystal configurations are limited. In this work we
   used sequential stacking of polystyrene nanosphere monolayers to form a
   bilayer crystal at the air/water interfaces. During this layer-by-layer
   stacking process, a crystal domain in the top layer gains the freedom to
   positon itself in a relative angle to that in the bottom layer allowing
   for the formation of moire patterns. Subsequent O-2 plasma etching
   results in a variety of complex nanostmctures that have not been
   reported before. Using etched moire patterns as masks, we further
   fabricated the corresponding gold nanostmctures and characterized their
   scattering optical properties. We believe this facile technique provides
   a new strategy to fabricate novel and complex plasmonic nanostmctures or
   metasurfaces.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{9107-9114}},
Abstract = {{Recently, alignment of block copolymer domains has been achieved using a
   topographically patterned substrate with a sidewall preferential to one
   of the blocks. This strategy has been suggested as an option to overcome
   the patterning resolution challenges facing chemoepitaxy strategies,
   which utilize chemical stripes with a width of about half the period of
   block copolymer to orient the equilibrium morphologies. In this work,
   single chain in mean field simulation methodology was used to study the
   self assembly of symmetric block copolymers on topographically patterned
   substrates with sidewall interactions. Random copolymer brushes grafted
   to the background region (space between patterns) were modeled
   explicitly. The effects of changes in pattern width, film thicknesses
   and strength of sidewall interaction on the resulting morphologies were
   examined and the conditions which led to perpendicular morphologies
   required for lithographic applications were identified. A number of
   density multiplication schemes were studied in order to gauge the
   efficiency with which the sidewall pattern can guide the self assembly
   of block copolymers. The results indicate that such a patterning
   technique can potentially utilize pattern widths of the order of one-two
   times the period of block copolymer and still be able to guide ordering
   of the block copolymer domains up to 8X density multiplication.}},

Title = {{Equilibrium cluster fluids: pair interactions via inverse design}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{48}},
Pages = {{9342-9354}},
Abstract = {{Inverse methods of statistical mechanics are becoming productive tools
   in the design of materials with specific microstructures or properties.
   While initial studies have focused on solid-state design targets (e.g.,
   assembly of colloidal superlattices), one can alternatively design fluid
   states with desired morphologies. This work addresses the latter and
   demonstrates how a simple iterative Boltzmann inversion strategy can be
   used to determine the isotropic pair potential that reproduces the
   radial distribution function of a fluid of amorphous clusters with
   prescribed size. The inverse designed pair potential of this ``ideal{''}
   cluster fluid, with its broad attractive well and narrow repulsive
   barrier at larger separations, is qualitatively different from the
   so-called SALR form most commonly associated with equilibrium cluster
   formation in colloids, which features short-range attractive (SA) and
   long-range repulsive (LR) contributions. These differences reflect
   alternative mechanisms for promoting cluster formation with an isotropic
   pair potential, and they in turn produce structured fluids with
   qualitatively different static and dynamic properties. Specifically,
   equilibrium simulations show that the amorphous clusters resulting from
   the inverse designed potentials display more uniformity in size and
   shape, and they also show greater spatial and temporal resolution than
   those resulting from SALR interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Bismuth vanadate, BiVO4, is a promising material for use as an anode in
   photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, its conversion efficiency
   is limited by poor bulk charge transport, which is via small-polarons.
   We report here the use of a suite of X-ray spectroscopic probes to
   determine the electronic structure of 0.3-0.6 at\% M:BiVO4 (M = Mo or
   W). The results are interpreted in the context of current theories
   regarding the influence of doping on the existence of inter-band gap
   small-polaron states and their effect on the conversion efficiency of
   BiVO4. Preliminary X-ray absorption and emission measurements reveal
   that doping widens the band gap from 2.50 to 2.75 eV, whereas the
   indirect nature of the band gap remains unaffected. X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy verified that the doping levels did not affect the
   distorted tetrahedral environment of V5+ in BiVO4. For BiVO4 and
   W:BiVO4, V L-3 resonant inelastic X-ray scattering showed energy loss
   features related to charge transfer from low lying valence metal/oxygen
   states to unoccupied V e(g) conduction band states. A 3.8 eV energy loss
   feature, coupled with small polaron-like peaks measured in valence band
   resonant photoelectron spectroscopy of M:BiVO4, point to the population
   of inter-band gap V 3d states of eg symmetry. The data reveals the
   existence of a band gap state in the absence of an applied bias in M:
   BiVO4, linked to small-polaron formation. We tentatively assign it as a
   deep trap state, which suggests that the improved conversion efficiency
   of M:BiVO4 relative to the undoped material is largely due to the
   increased carrier concentration in spite of increased carrier
   recombination rates.}},

Abstract = {{Three Dimensional Integrated Circuits are an important new paradigm in
   which different dies are stacked atop one another, and interconnected by
   Through Silicon Vias (TSVs). Testing 3D-ICs poses additional challenges
   because of the need to transfer data to the non-bottom layers and the
   limited number of TSVs available in the 3D-ICs for the data transfer. A
   novel test compression technique is proposed that introduces the ability
   to share tester data across layers using daisy-chained decompressors.
   This improves the encoding of test patterns substantially, thereby
   reducing the amount of test data required to be stored on the external
   tester. In addition, an inter-layer serialization technique is proposed,
   which further reduces the number of TSVs required, using simple hardware
   to serialize and deserialize the test data. Experimental results are
   presented demonstrating the efficiency of the technique proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Heart valves play a very important role in the functioning of the heart
   and many of the heart failures are related to the valvular dysfunctions,
   e.g. aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Relationship between the
   biomechanical properties of valve leaflets and their function has long
   been established, however, determining these properties in a
   non-invasive manner remains a challenge. Here we present a framework for
   such a tool for biomechanical properties determination. We use an
   inverse-modeling approach, where the only input is through imaging the
   leaflet tissue as it is loaded naturally during its functional cycle.
   Using a structural model for the leaflet material behavior allows us to
   reduce the number of parameters to be determined to only two, which in
   addition to dramatically reducing the computational time also allows one
   to visualize the cost function and the minimization process. We close
   with discussion about the contributions of the current framework and
   other constituents needed to make it a clinically viable tool.}},

Journal = {{GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the ECCO v4 non-linear inverse modeling framework
   and its baseline solution for the evolving ocean state over the period
   1992-2011. Both components are publicly available and subjected to
   regular, automated regression tests. The modeling framework includes
   sets of global conformal grids, a global model setup, implementations of
   data constraints and control parameters, an interface to algorithmic
   differentiation, as well as a grid-independent, fully capable Matlab
   toolbox. The baseline ECCO v4 solution is a dynamically consistent ocean
   state estimate without unidentified sources of heat and buoyancy, which
   any interested user will be able to reproduce accurately. The solution
   is an acceptable fit to most data and has been found to be physically
   plausible in many respects, as documented here and in related
   publications. Users are being provided with capabilities to assess
   model-data misfits for themselves. The synergy between modeling and data
   synthesis is asserted through the joint presentation of the modeling
   framework and the state estimate. In particular, the inverse estimate of
   parameterized physics was instrumental in improving the fit to the
   observed hydrography, and becomes an integral part of the ocean model
   setup available for general use. More generally, a first assessment of
   the relative importance of external, parametric and structural model
   errors is presented. Parametric and external model uncertainties appear
   to be of comparable importance and dominate over structural model
   uncertainty. The results generally underline the importance of including
   turbulent transport parameters in the inverse problem.}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{C497-C531}},
Abstract = {{The forest-of-octrees approach to parallel adaptive mesh refinement and
   coarsening has recently been demonstrated in the context of a number of
   large-scale PDE-based applications. Efficient reference software has
   been made freely available to the public both in the form of the
   standalone p4est library and more indirectly by the general-purpose
   finite element library deal. II, which has been equipped with a p4est
   backend. Although linear octrees, which store only leaf octants, have an
   underlying tree structure by definition, it is not fully exploited in
   previously published mesh-related algorithms. This is because tree
   branches are not explicitly stored and because the topological
   relationships in meshes, such as the adjacency between cells, introduce
   dependencies that do not respect the octree hierarchy. In this work, we
   combine hierarchical and topological relationships between octants to
   design efficient recursive algorithms that operate on distributed
   forests of octrees. We present three important algorithms with recursive
   implementations. The first is a parallel search for leaves matching any
   of a set of multiple search criteria, such as leaves that contain points
   or intersect polytopes. The second is a ghost layer construction
   algorithm that handles arbitrarily refined octrees that are not covered
   by previous algorithms, which require a 2: 1 condition between
   neighboring leaves. The third is a universal mesh topology iterator.
   This iterator visits every cell in a partition, as well as every
   interface (face, edge, and corner) between these cells. The iterator
   calculates the local topological information for every interface that it
   visits, taking into account the nonconforming interfaces that increase
   the complexity of describing the local topology. To demonstrate the
   utility of the topology iterator, we use it to compute the numbering and
   encoding of higher-order C-0 nodal basis functions used for finite
   elements. We analyze the complexity of the new recursive algorithms
   theoretically and assess their performance, both in terms of
   single-processor efficiency and in terms of parallel scalability,
   demonstrating good weak and strong scaling up to 458,000 cores of the
   JUQUEEN supercomputer.}},

Abstract = {{Finding optimal word lengths in digital signal processing systems has
   been one of the primary mechanisms for reducing complexity. Recently,
   this topic has been explored in a broader approximate computing context,
   where architectures allowing for fine-grain control of hardware or
   software accuracy have been proposed. One of the obstacles for adoption
   of fine-grain scaling techniques is that they require determining the
   precision of all intermediate values at all possible operation points,
   making simulation-based optimization infeasible. In this chapter, we
   study efficient analytical heuristics to find optimal sets of word
   lengths for all variables and operations in a dataflow graph constrained
   by mean squared error type of metrics. We apply our method to several
   industrial-strength examples. Our results show a more than 5,000x
   improvement in optimization time compared to an efficient
   simulation-based word length optimization method with less than 10\%
   estimation error across a range of target quality metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical energy storage system such as secondary batteries is the

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{21824-21831}},
Abstract = {{One critical hindrance to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a Ni-based
   anode fueled with hydrocarbons is the coking (carbon deposition)
   phenomenon; on anodes exposed directly to hydrocarbon fuels, solid
   carbonaceous materials accumulate during SOFC operation, resulting in
   severe degradation of the catalytic activity of Ni and structural damage
   to the anode. This may be overcome by Ni-M (M = Sn, Sb) intermetallic
   compound-based catalytic functional layers (CFLs) on the anode surface.
   Sn or Sb incorporated onto Ni surface develops into intermetallic
   compounds under reducing atmosphere, thereby interrupting the
   interaction between Ni and the solid carbon produced by hydrocarbon
   cracking beforehand. Moreover, the hydrophilic properties of Sn or Sb
   facilitate the formation of hydroxyl groups on their surfaces by
   reaction with the water vapor generated by the electrochemical oxidation
   of fuel, and the solid carbon accumulated onto the intermetallic surface
   is oxidized by the hydroxyls and removed from the anode. With these
   roles of Sn or Sb in M/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 CFLs, we show here that the
   operational stability of SOFCs can be maintained more than 200 h in
   methane fuel at intermediate temperatures.}},

   characteristics of lithium-rich layered oxide cathodes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{44}},
Pages = {{22199-22207}},
Abstract = {{Li-rich layered oxides are being pursued intensively as next generation
   cathodes for Li-ion batteries due to their high capacity, but their
   adoption is hampered by voltage decay during cycling. This investigation
   focuses on the effect of Ni oxidation state on the structural and
   electrochemical properties, including voltage decay, of Li-rich layered
   oxides. With increasing Ni3+ content, (i) the interlayer mixing between
   Li and Ni (cation disorder) decreases due to its smaller size compared
   to Ni2+, (ii) the oxygen loss plateau decreases in length due the
   decreased Mn4+ content and Li content in the transition-metal layer,
   resulting in a reduction in Li2MnO3 character, (iii) the discharge
   capacity decreases due to the shorter plateau and a larger 1st cycle
   irreversible capacity loss, (iv) the operating voltage increases due to
   the increasing amount of Ni and as Ni4+/3+ reduction occurs at a higher
   voltage than Mn4+ reduction, and (v) cyclability is enhanced as less
   Mn3+ ions are formed, minimizing Mn dissolution. Most importantly, the
   decreasing degree of Mn reduction suppresses the layered-to-spinel phase
   transformation and the consequent voltage decay. Increasing the
   oxidation state of Ni could thus be a potential approach to reduce the
   voltage decay in lithium-rich layered oxides, but it would cause a
   decrease in capacity.}},

Title = {{Model-Based Control of a Continuous Coating Line for Proton Exchange
   Membrane Fuel Cell Electrode Assembly}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The most expensive component of a fuel cell is the membrane electrode
   assembly (MEA), which consists of an ionomer membrane coated with
   catalyst material. Best-performing MEAs are currently fabricated by
   depositing and drying liquid catalyst ink on the membrane; however, this
   process is limited to individual preparation by hand due to the
   membrane's rapid water absorption that leads to shape deformation and
   coating defects. A continuous coating line can reduce the cost and time
   needed to fabricate the MEA, incentivizing the commercialization and
   widespread adoption of fuel cells. A pilot-scale membrane coating line
   was designed for such a task and is described in this paper. Accurate
   process control is necessary to prevent manufacturing defects from
   occurring in the coating line. A linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
   controller was developed based on a physics-based model of the coating
   process to optimally control the temperature and humidity of the drying
   zones. The process controller was implemented in the pilot-scale coating
   line proving effective in preventing defects.}},

   composite anodes as measured by GITT}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion coefficient of lithium is an important parameter in
   determining the rate capability of an electrode and its ability to
   deliver high power output. Galvanostatic intermittent titration
   technique (GITT) is a quick electrochemical method to determine
   diffusion coefficients in electrode materials and is applied here to
   antimony-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries. Like other alloy
   anodes, antimony suffers from large volume change and a short cycle
   life, so GITT is also applied to determine the effects on lithium
   diffusivity of antimony intermetallics and composite electrodes designed
   to mitigate these issues. Pure antimony is measured to have a diffusion
   coefficient of 4.0 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1), in agreement with previously
   measured values. The intermetallics NiSb, FeSb, and FeSb2 all
   demonstrate diffusivity values within an order of magnitude of antimony,
   while Cu2Sb shows roughly an order of magnitude improvement due to the
   persistence of the Cu2Sb phase during cycling. The composite electrode
   FeSb-TiC is shown to offer significant enhancement of the diffusion
   coefficient positively correlated with higher concentrations of TiC in
   the composite up to a maximum value of 1.9 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) at 60
   wt\% TiC, nearly two full orders of magnitude greater than that of pure
   antimony.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{29184-29192}},
Abstract = {{AMP and its blends are an attractive solvent for CO2 capture, but the
   underlying reaction mechanisms still remain uncertain. We attempt to
   elucidate the factors enhancing bicarbonate production in aqueous AMP as
   compared to MEA which, like most other primary amines, preferentially
   forms carbamate. According to our predicted reaction energies, AMP and
   MEA exhibit similar thermodynamic favorability for bicarbonate versus
   carbamate formation; moreover, the conversion of carbamate to
   bicarbonate also does not appear more favorable kinetically in aqueous
   AMP compared to MEA. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, however,
   demonstrate that bicarbonate formation tends to be kinetically more
   probable in aqueous AMP while carbamate is more likely to form in
   aqueous MEA. Analysis of the solvation structure and dynamics shows that
   the enhanced interaction between N and H2O may hinder CO2 accessibility
   while facilitating the AMP + H2O -> AMPH(+) + OH- reaction, relative to
   the MEA case. This study highlights the importance of not only
   thermodynamic but also kinetic factors in describing CO2 capture by

Title = {{Chemical extraction of Zn from ZnMn2O4-based spinels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{42}},
Pages = {{21077-21082}},
Abstract = {{With an aim to increase the energy density compared to current Li-ion
   batteries, there is immense interest in rechargeable batteries with
   multivalent cations, such as Mg2+ and Zn2+, as they could provide higher
   charge storage capacity. alpha-MnO2 has been investigated as a cathode
   for Zn-ion batteries, but other structures could be explored.
   Accordingly, this study investigates the chemical extraction of Zn from
   the spinel compositions ZnMn2-xNixO4 (x = 0, 0.5, and 1) using H2SO4 and
   NO2BF4. Acid treatment is able to extract Zn from the structure through
   a Mn3+ disproportionation reaction that is dependent on the Mn-3+
   content. Zn extraction decreases with increasing Ni content due to the
   decrease in Mn3+ content; in fact, ZnMnNiO4 does not lose any Zn upon
   acid treatment because all of the Mn ions are in the 4+ state. Treatment
   with NO2BF4, however, is unable to extract any Zn from the samples,
   unlike in the analogous LiMn2O4 spinel. This is believed to be due to
   the high electrostatic repulsion that Zn2+ ions would feel from other
   Zn2+ ions in neighboring tetrahedral sites as they have to diffuse
   through the unoccupied octahedral sites in the spinel lattice, and Zn2+
   does not prefer octahedral sites. Because NO2BF4 more closely
   approximates the extraction mechanism experienced in a Zn-ion cell, it
   appears that the ideal spinel structure is not suitable as a Zn-ion
   battery cathode unless synthesis conditions or additional treatments
   were used to create vacancies in the structure that allows for easier
   Zn-ion diffusion without much electrostatic repulsion.}},

Title = {{Enhanced thermoelectric power factor of Re-substituted higher manganese
   silicides with small islands of MnSi secondary phase}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{10500-10508}},
Abstract = {{Higher manganese silicides (HMS) are promising thermoelectric materials
   owing to the abundance of the constituent elements in the earth crust,
   environmental friendliness and good chemical stability at high
   temperatures. However, the metallic MnSi layers with a lateral size as
   large as similar to 50 mu m are formed in the melt-grown HMS samples.
   These large MnSi layers are characterized with relatively high
   electrical and thermal conductivities and low Seebeck coefficient, which
   can degrade the thermoelectric performance of the melt-grown samples.
   Here, we report the synthesis and thermoelectric properties of
   Re-substituted HMS with relatively small-size MnSi platelets via
   melt-quenching, followed by ball-milling, and consolidated by spark
   plasma sintering. As compared to the samples prepared by either
   solid-state reaction or mechanical alloying, the reduced lateral size of
   MnSi in the quenched sample leads to an increased carrier concentration
   without a reduction in the carrier mobility according to our electrical
   transport measurements. As a result, the thermoelectric power factor is
   increased to 1.9 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3) W m(-1) K-2 at 860 K, which is about
   20\% higher than that of the sample prepared by solid-state reaction. In
   addition, the lattice thermal conductivity of the quenched sample
   remains nearly the same as the samples prepared by two other synthesis
   methods. Therefore, a figure-of-merit ZT of 0.64 +/- 0.08 at 823 K is
   obtained for the quenched sample, compared to 0.57 + 0.07 and 0.26 +
   0.03 obtained from the two other samples prepared by different methods.}},

Title = {{Controlled delivery of SDF-1 alpha and IGF-1: CXCR4(+) cell recruitment

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1475-1486}},
Abstract = {{Therapeutic delivery of regeneration-promoting biological factors
   directly to the site of injury has demonstrated its efficacy in various
   injury models. Several reports describe improved tissue regeneration
   following local injection of tissue specific growth factors, cytokines
   and chemokines. Evidence exists that combined cytokine/growth factor
   treatment is superior for optimizing tissue repair by targeting
   different aspects of the regeneration response. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the controlled
   delivery of stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1 alpha) alone or in
   combination with insulin-like growth factor-I (SDF-1 alpha/IGF-I) for
   the treatment of tourniquet-induced ischemia/reperfusion injury (TK-I/R)
   of skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that SDF-1 alpha will promote
   sustained stem cell recruitment to the site of muscle injury, while
   IGF-I will induce progenitor cell differentiation to effectively restore
   muscle contractile function after TK-I/R injury while concurrently
   reducing apoptosis. Utilizing a novel poly-ethylene glycol PEGylated
   fibrin gel matrix (PEG-Fib), we incorporated SDF-1 alpha alone
   (PEG-Fib/SDF-1 alpha) or in combination with IGF-I (PEG-Fib/SDF-1
   alpha/IGF-I) for controlled release at the site of acute muscle injury.
   Despite enhanced cell recruitment and revascularization of the
   regenerating muscle after SDF-1 alpha treatment, functional analysis
   showed no benefit from PEG-Fib/SDF-1 alpha therapy, while dual delivery
   of PEG-Fib/SDF-1 alpha/IGF-I resulted in IGF-I-mediated improvement of
   maximal force recovery and SDF-1 alpha-driven in vivo neovasculogenesis.
   Histological data supported functional data, as well as highlighted the
   important differences in the regeneration process among treatment
   groups. This study provides evidence that while revascularization may be
   necessary for maximizing muscle force recovery, without modulation of
   other effects of inflammation it is insufficient.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of structure and bonding in nanoscale materials is
   incomplete without knowledge of their surface structure. Needed are
   better surveying capabilities responsive not only to different atoms at
   the surface, but also their respective coordination environments. We
   report here that d-block organometallics, when placed at nanocrystal
   surfaces through heterometallic bonds, serve as molecular beacons
   broadcasting local surface structure in atomic detail. This unique
   ability stems from their elemental specificity and the sensitivity of
   their d-orbital level alignment to local coordination environment, which
   can be assessed spectroscopically. Re-surfacing cadmium and lead
   chalcogenide nanocrystals with iron- or ruthenium-based molecular
   beacons is readily accomplished with trimethylsilylated cyclopentadienyl
   metal carbonyls. For PbSe nanocrystals with iron-based beacons, we show
   how core-level X-ray spectroscopies and DFT calculations enrich our
   understanding of both charge and atomic reorganization at the surface
   when beacons are bound.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes recent research on modeling steel fracture at
   elevated temperature. Modeling fracture is important for simulating the
   behavior of steel connections in fire, where fracture of bolts or other
   connection elements is often the failure mode that controls overall
   strength and deformation capacity of the connection. In this study, true
   stress-strain curves for structural steel at ambient and elevated
   temperatures are first developed that extend beyond necking. Then two
   widely used fracture criteria (ductile fracture and shear fracture
   criterion) are studied in order to model steel fracture at ambient and
   elevated temperatures. Calibration of fracture parameters for these
   criteria is performed by using finite element analysis together with
   experimental data. To verify the accuracy of the calibrated fracture
   parameters, comparisons are presented between the results of elevated
   temperature connection tests and simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need for analytical tools that can accurately model
   the behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) structures under extreme loads,
   particularly with respect to blast and impact. Current capabilities are
   almost entirely confined to hydrocodes (e.g., LS-DYNA) and such
   procedures have often met with limited success as they typically require
   complex micro-modeling representations of the structure, which is
   expensive in preparation and computation, and many of the commercial
   programs have shown deficiencies in their abilities to adequately
   capture cracked concrete response, particularly with regard to brittle
   shear-critical behavior.
   This paper presents the application of an alternative modeling procedure
   for RC slabs and shells subjected to blast and impact loads. The
   nonlinear finite element program employed uses a layered thick-shell
   element with RC constitutive modeling done in accordance with the
   formulations of the Disturbed Stress Field Model, a smeared rotating
   crack procedure shown to be capable of accurately capturing the behavior
   of shear-critical elements under conventional static loads. The smeared
   modeling approach differs from that typically employed by hydrocodes and
   results in simple model construction and reduced computation cost. The
   program is used to model the response of intermediate-scale RC and steel
   fiber-reinforced concrete slabs tested under repeated high-mass
   low-velocity impacts. Using simple finite element meshing techniques and
   material behavioral models requiring only basic user input, good
   correlation between the observed and modeled slab response was attained.
   The analyses provided high accuracy estimates of peak and residual
   displacements and successfully captured the punching shear failure modes
   observed experimentally.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of volatile organic compounds can be necessary to ensure
   healthy indoor environments. Many methods exist to collect and analyze
   volatile organic compounds, and each technique is associated with
   characteristic issues that affect the identification and quantification
   of some volatile organic compounds. In this study, simultaneous samples
   of volatile organic compounds were collected during 30 test visits in 14
   retail stores. Time-integrated measurements were made using Summa
   canisters, Tenax-GR sorbent tubes, and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine tubes.
   Time-resolved measurements were collected using photoionization
   detectors and colorimetric formaldehyde multimode monitors. Sampling
   with Summa canisters is less field intensive than with sorbent tubes;
   however, samples collected using Tenax-GR sorbent tubes indicated more
   possible exceedances of health guidelines compared to Summa canister
   samples. Photoionization detector total volatile organic compound
   concentrations were not directly correlated with Summa canister results
   even after correction for differential response to different volatile
   organic compounds. Formaldehyde monitor results were strongly correlated
   with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine tube results for formaldehyde, and the
   two sampling techniques agreed on all exceedances of the National
   Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) chronic recommended
   exposure limit (16 ppb) but not on exceedances of the stricter Office of
   Environmental Health Hazard Assessment chronic recommended exposure
   limit (7.3 ppb) at two stores. The formaldehyde monitor showed promising
   characteristics, supporting its further consideration as an indicator to
   control ventilation and/or environmental parameters in buildings where
   formaldehyde concentrations are of concern. The variation in results
   from various volatile organic compound sampling approaches can lead to
   different compliance levels with green building standards for a single
   building.}},

Abstract = {{Conductive polymers combine the attractive properties associated with
   conventional polymers and unique electronic properties of metals or
   semiconductors. Recently, nanostructured conductive polymers have
   aroused considerable research interest owing to their unique properties
   over their bulk counterparts, such as large surface areas and shortened
   pathways for charge/mass transport, which make them promising candidates
   for broad applications in energy conversion and storage, sensors,
   actuators, and biomedical devices. Numerous synthetic strategies have
   been developed to obtain various conductive polymer nanostructures, and
   high-performance devices based on these nanostructured conductive
   polymers have been realized. This Tutorial review describes the
   synthesis and characteristics of different conductive polymer
   nanostructures; presents the representative applications of
   nanostructured conductive polymers as active electrode materials for
   electrochemical capacitors and lithium-ion batteries and new
   perspectives of functional materials for next-generation high-energy
   batteries, meanwhile discusses the general design rules, advantages, and
   limitations of nanostructured conductive polymers in the energy storage

Abstract = {{A custom separator with an ultra-lightweight polyaniline
   nanofiber/multiwall carbon nanotube (PANiNF/MWCNT) coating has been
   utilized in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries for investigating the
   electrochemical performance of the hybrid conductive-polymer/carbon
   coating. The cells employing the PANiNF/MWCNT-functionalized separators
   facilitate high reversible capacities of 709, 641, and 612 mA h g(-1)
   at, respectively, C/5, C/2, and 1C rates after 100 cycles. High
   charge-storage capacity retention was also found in the cell with the
   PANiNF/MWCNT-functionalized separator after a resting time of 12 h. Such
   dynamic and static electrochemical stability could be ascribed to the
   synergistic physical adsorption and chemical immobilization of the
   polysulfides by the ultra-lightweight PANiNF/MWCNT coating (only 0.01 mg
   cm(-2)). This demonstrates that the design of hybrid
   polymer/carbon-coated-separators has the potential to become a viable

Abstract = {{Flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors have offered promising
   applications as novel energy storage devices based on their merits, such
   as small size, low cost, light weight and high wearability for
   high-performance portable electronics. However, one major challenge to
   make flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors depends on the improvement
   of electrode materials with higher electrical conductivity properties
   and longer cycling stability. In this article, we put forward a simple
   strategy to in situ synthesize 1D CoMoO4 nanowires (NWs), using highly
   conductive CC and an electrically conductive PPy wrapping layer on
   CoMoO4 NW arrays for high performance electrode materials. The results
   show that the CoMoO4/PPy hybrid NW electrode exhibits a high areal
   specific capacitance of ca. 1.34 F cm(-2) at a current density of 2 mA
   cm(-2), which is remarkably better than the corresponding values for a
   pure CoMoO4 NW electrode of 0.7 F cm(-2). An excellent cycling
   performance of nanocomposites of up to 95.2\% (ca. 1.12 F cm(-2)) is
   achieved after 2000 cycles compared to pristine CoMoO4 NWs. In addition,
   we fabricate flexible all-solid-state ASC which can be cycled reversibly
   in the voltage range of 0-1.7 V, and exhibits a maximum energy density
   of 104.7 W h kg(-1) (3.522 mW h cm(-3)), demonstrating great potential
   for practical applications in flexible energy storage electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of automated vehicles holds great promise for the future
   of transportation. Although commercial sales of fully self-driving
   vehicles will not commence for several more years, once these sales are
   possible a new transportation mode for personal travel promises to
   arrive. This new mode is the shared autonomous (or fully automated)
   vehicle (SAV), combining features of short-term, on-demand rentals with
   self-driving capabilities: in essence, a driverless taxi. This
   investigation examined the potential implications of the SAY at a low
   level of market penetration (1.3\% of regional trips) by simulating a
   fleet of SAVs serving travelers in the 12-mi by 24-mi regional core of
   Austin, Texas. The simulation used a sample of trips from the region's
   planning model to generate demand across traffic analysis zones and a
   32,272-link network. Trips called on the vehicles in 5-min departure
   time windows, with link-level travel times varying by hour of day based
   on MATSIM's dynamic traffic assignment simulation software. Results
   showed that each SAY could replace about nine conventional vehicles
   within the 24-mi by 12-mi area while still maintaining a reasonable
   level of service (as proxied by user wait times, which averaged just 1
   min). Additionally, approximately 8\% more vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
   may be generated because of SAV's ability to journey unoccupied to the
   next traveler or relocate to a more favorable position in anticipation
   of its next period demand.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},

Abstract = {{The effects of various cationic substitutions in lithium-rich layered
   Li{[}Li0.2Mn0.4Co0.4-xMx]O-2 (M = Cr, Fe, and Ni) on the electrochemical
   behavior and oxygen loss have been systematically investigated. Fe
   substitution dramatically decreases the reversible capacity of
   Li{[}Li0.2Mn0.4Co0.4-xFex]O-2 due to the reduced oxygen loss from the
   lattice caused by a decrease in the metal-oxygen covalence and an
   irreversible migration of Fe3+ ions. With increasing Cr substitution,
   the reversible capacity of Li{[}Li0.2Mn0.4Co0.4-xCrx]O-2 first increases
   due to the multi-electron transfer reaction of the Cr3+/6+ redox couple
   and then decreases due to reduced oxygen loss and irreversible migration
   of the smaller Cr6+ ions from octahedral to tetrahedral sites. With
   increasing Ni substitution, the reversible capacity of
   Li{[}Li0.2Mn0.4Co0.4-xNix]O-2 also first increases because Ni3+ can be
   fully oxidized to Ni4+ before the oxygen loss begins while Co3+ can be
   oxidized only to around Co3.6+ and then decreases due to suppressed
   oxygen loss caused by the decrease in metal-oxygen covalence. Also, the
   Ni substitution raises the average discharge potential as Ni3+ ions will
   be reduced to Ni2+ before the Mn4+ ions are reduced to Mn3+. The study
   demonstrates the sensitivity and intricacies associated with the nature
   of the cations in lithium-rich layered oxide cathodes. (C) The Author(s)

Abstract = {{Purpose - Currently, human hearts destined for transplantation can be
   used for 4.5 hours which is often insufficient to test the heart, the
   purpose of this paper is to find a compatible recipient and transport
   the heart to larger distances. Cooling systems with simultaneous
   internal and external liquid cooling were numerically simulated as a
   method to extend the usable life of human hearts.
   Design/methodology/approach - Coolant was pumped inside major veins and
   through the cardiac chambers and also between the heart and cooling
   container walls. In Case 1, two inlets and two outlets on the container
   walls steadily circulated the coolant. In the Case 2, an additional
   inlet was specified on the container wall thus creating a steady jet
   impinging one of the thickest parts of the heart. Laminar internal flow
   and turbulent external flow were used in both cases. Unsteady periodic
   inlet velocities at two frequencies were applied in Case 3 and Case 4
   that had four inlets and four outlets on walls with turbulent flows used
   for internal and external circulations.
   Findings - Computational results show that the proposed cooling systems
   are able to reduce the heart temperature from + 37 degrees C to almost
   uniform + 5 degrees C within 25 min of cooling, thus reducing its
   metabolic rate of decay by 95 percent. Calculated combined thermal and
   hydrodynamic stresses were below the allowable threshold. Unsteady flows
   did not make any noticeable difference in the speed of cooling and
   uniformity of temperature field.
   Originality/value - This is the pioneering numerical study of conjugate
   convective cooling schemes capable of cooling organs much faster and
   more uniformly than currently practiced.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid nanostructures of low-dimensional metal oxide (MO) semiconductors
   based on two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanosheets have been considered
   as one of the most promising nanomaterials for an extensive variety of
   applications. Unfortunately, it is still challenging to rationally
   design and fabricate MO/graphene hybrids with highly controllable
   nanostructures and desirable properties, which are of paramount
   importance for practical applications. Here, we report a novel, facile
   and ``green{''} glycerol-mediated self-assembly method, using
   alpha-Fe2O3 semiconductor as an illustrative example, for the controlled
   growth of MO with a well-defined nanostructure on 2D graphene
   nanosheets. Based on this new method, we first demonstrate the ability
   to exquisitely tune the alpha-Fe2O3 nanostructure from zero-dimensional
   quantum dots (similar to 3.2 nm) to one-dimensional mesoporous nanorods,
   and eventually to 2D mesoporous nanosheets over the entire surface of
   graphene nanosheets. A possible formation mechanism has been proposed
   based on the systematic investigation of the morphological evolution and
   growth processes of alpha-Fe2O3 on graphene. The as-synthesized samples
   exhibit excellent performance for the photo-Fenton treatment of polluted
   water at neutral pH under visible light irradiation. Moreover, TiO2 and
   Fe3O4 quantum dots (similar to 5.2 and 3.3 nm, respectively)
   ultradispersed on graphene are also successfully synthesized by this
   method, demonstrating its versatility for the rational fabrication of
   novel MO/graphene hybrids with huge potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the materials characteristics that lead to high
   electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is
   needed to make electrolytic hydrogen fuel production and rechargeable
   metal-air batteries a reality. Here, the first systematic investigation
   of a family of Ni-rich layered LiNi1-xMxO2 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) oxides
   reveals that the catalytic activity can be tuned by varying the Ni
   content, nature of the transition-metal dopant, lithium content, and
   degree of cation ordering between Li and Ni/M. In particular, Fe-doping
   in LiNi1-xMxO2 imparts the most dramatic improvements in OER activity,
   possibly due to the flexibility of Fe to adopt different coordination
   geometries on the surface. Xray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) data
   reveal that the surface of the Fe-doped sample is enriched with Fe while
   ex situ Raman spectroscopy indicates that the layered morphology is
   preserved during electrochemical cycling, but the cation disorder
   increases. Among the various LiNi1-xMxO2 compositions investigated,
   LiNi0.7Co0.3Fe0.2O2 exhibits the highest OER activity, which increases
   further when excess lithium and oxygen vacancies are present, and good
   stability. The Ni-rich LiNi1-xMxO2 samples join a growing number of
   highly active iron-doped systems for OER electrocatalysis in alkaline
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal stability and reactions of Sb and the intermetallic Cu2Sb in
   lithium-ion batteries has been investigated and analyzed relative to
   graphite electrodes under the same conditions. Bulk and surface layer
   products of the thermal reactions have been characterized by ex situ
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been employed to investigate
   the relative heat generation with these electrodes and their potential
   to enhance lithium-ion battery safety by reducing the low-temperature
   exothermic driving force for thermal runaway. Sb and Cu2Sb are both
   found to undergo low-temperature reactions similar to graphite, with
   reactions at, respectively, similar to 90 and 130 degrees C related to
   solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer breakdown. The heat generation
   per unit capacity for both Sb and Cu2Sb at < 150 degrees C is similar to
   37\% lower than that with graphite, which is a critical range for
   prevention of thermal runaway. Because neither Sb nor Cu are shown to be
   present in the SEI layer in appreciable quantities, this reduction in
   heat generation is largely attributed to the greater volumetric
   capacities of antimony and Cu2Sb that allow for greater lithium storage
   with less surface exposure for the formation of a thermally unstable SEI
   layer. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been reported that Pd-Au bimetallic catalysts display improved
   catalytic performance after adequate calcination. In this study, a model
   catalyst study was conducted to investigate the effects of annealing in
   oxygen on the surface structures of Pd-Au alloys by comparing the
   physicochemical properties of Pd/Au(111) surfaces that were annealed in
   ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) versus in an oxygen ambient. Auger electron
   spectroscopy (AES) and Basin hopping simulations reveal that the
   presence of oxygen can inhibit the diffusion of surface Pd atoms into
   the subsurface of the Au(111) sample. Reflection-absorption infrared
   spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule (CO-RAIRS) and King-Wells
   measurements of O-2 uptake suggest that surfaces annealed in an oxygen
   ambient possess more contiguous Pd sites than surfaces annealed under
   UHV conditions. The oxygen-annealed Pd/Au(111) surface exhibited a
   higher activity for CO oxidation in reactive molecular beam scattering
   (RMBS) experiments. This enhanced activity likely results from the
   higher oxygen uptake and relatively facile dissociation of oxygen
   admolecules due to stronger adsorbate-surface interactions as suggested
   by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements. These
   observations provide fundamental insights into the surface phenomena of
   Pd-Au alloys, which may prove beneficial in the design of future Pd-Au
   catalysts.}},

   temperature. The supramolecular soft template provided by the DES
   structure and its viscosity at different temperatures drives directed
   growth of crystalline gold and self-assembly producing star-shaped
   AuNSs. Additionally, the effect of AuNS shape and surface area on their
   catalytic activity towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has
   been tested. With the advantage of their high surface area and presence
   of high-index facets in the edge of the star arms, the star-shaped
   nanostructures showed superior electrocatalytic activity than other
   morphologies. The use of DES as a green chemistry platform for the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHOTOPOLYMER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{67-71}},
Abstract = {{Low molecular weight photopolymers are candidate materials for resists
   in Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography. The patterned chemical
   transformations used in photolithography generate a surface energy
   pattern that can induce flow in low molecular weight photopolymers via
   the Marangoni effect, due to their intrinsically higher translational
   mobility relative to larger polymers. To demonstrate this outcome, a low
   molecular weight photopolymer bearing acid-labile protecting groups was
   co-cast with a photo-acid generator and exposed through a contact mask.
   During a post-exposure bake above the film's glass transition
   temperature, unexposed polymer flowed into deprotected regions since the
   deprotected polymers possess relatively higher surface tension compared
   to the unreacted polymers. After cooling, the film exhibited thickness
   variations of up to 90 nm, and the topographic profile reflected the
   mask pattern. An appreciation of this transport mechanism could be
   useful to those integrating low molecular weight photopolymers into
   lithographic process flows.}},

Abstract = {{A photochemical process for controlling block copolymer (BCP) domain
   orientation in an area selected manner is described. Polymers with
   photoswitching surface energy, used as interfacial underlayers adjoining

   interfacial polymers were designed to be either inherently neutral or
   preferential to poly(styrene-block-4-trimethylsilylstyrene). Through
   patternwise exposure to 193nm light and subsequent reaction with
   photogenerated acid, the wetting characteristics of the underlayer
   material can be switched from neutral to preferential (N2P) or
   preferential to neutral (P2N). Thermal annealing of the BCP confined
   between a patterned N2P or P2N substrate and a neutral top coat results
   in alternating areas of perpendicular and parallel BCP domains within
   the same film. If adapted in tandem with directed self-assembly, this
   approach could enable new routes to customizable patterns for advanced

Title = {{Adaptive Second Order Sliding Mode Control of a Fuel Cell Hybrid System
   for Electric Vehicle Applications}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{We present an adaptive-gain second order sliding mode (SOSM) control
   applied to a hybrid power system for electric vehicle applications. The
   main advantage of the adaptive SOSM is that it does not require the
   upper bound of the uncertainty. The proposed hybrid system consists of a
   polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) with a unidirectional
   DC/DC converter and a Li-ion battery stack with a bidirectional DC/DC
   converter, where the PEMFC is employed as the primary energy source and
   the battery is employed as the second energy source. One of the main
   limitations of the FC is its slow dynamics mainly due to the air-feed
   system and fuel-delivery system. Fuel starvation phenomenon will occur
   during fast load demand. Therefore, the second energy source is required
   to assist the main source to improve system perofrmance. The proposed
   energy management system contains two cascade control structures, which
   are used to regulate the fuel cell and battery currents to track the
   given reference currents and stabilize the DC bus voltage while
   satisfying the physical limitations. The proposed control strategy is
   evaluated for two real driving cycles, that is, Urban Dynamometer
   Driving Schedule (UDDS) and Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule
   (HWFET).}},

   Assignment Models with Added Network Detail}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2498}},
Pages = {{19-26}},
Abstract = {{Advanced traffic assignment models, such as simulation-based dynamic
   traffic assignment, typically incorporate more detailed network
   representations than do traditional planning models. In this context,
   the placement of centroid connectors may have a significant effect on
   model performance, and attention must be paid to their number and
   location to avoid unrealistic congestion or low utilization of minor
   roadways by local traffic. Given that the manual inspection of centroid
   connector placement may be too time-consuming in large regional
   networks, this paper proposes two simple automatic centroid connector
   placement strategies for dynamic traffic assignment applications. The
   first approach radially distributes the connectors to the nearest nodes
   and is intended to exemplify some limitations of the most common
   techniques in practice. The second strategy involves dividing the
   centroid and subsequent demand into two parts, distributing the demand
   across one sub-centroid linked to nearby nodes and one linked to the
   periphery, and thus effectively establishing a bilevel distribution. A
   modification of this strategy involves eliminating nodes at signalized
   intersections as viable candidates for connection. As part of the
   evaluation of the methods, a new metric, the locality factor, has been
   introduced to describe the use of minor streets by local traffic. The
   numerical experiments, conducted on two real-world networks, exemplify
   the effects of the incorporation of local streets and the placement of
   centroid connectors on model results. Sensitivity testing and limited
   field data comparisons suggest that the bilevel centroid connector
   placement strategy achieves more realistic results.}},

Pages = {{75-83}},
Abstract = {{Research on the range anxiety of battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers
   is limited, and research on the route choice of such drivers has been
   restricted to a fixed range limit modeled as a distance constrained
   shortest path problem. In this paper, a more general network route
   choice model based on the range anxiety of BEY drivers is formulated as
   a nonadditive shortest path problem. More appropriate for BEVs, a
   tour-based analysis with a continuum of range limits is considered, and
   an outer approximation algorithm has been used to find the optimal path.
   Numerical experiments on a small network demonstrate how the routes

Pages = {{2389-2395}},
Abstract = {{Despite great interest in a Li-S battery, soluble polysulfides as
   charge/discharge intermediates pose an important challenge to realize
   commercial Li-S batteries. For building physical barriers to reduce a
   diffusional loss of those species, chemical surfacetrap- sites have been
   proposed, but experimental evidence about the trapping interaction
   hasn't been reported. Here, highly crosslinked polymer-electrolyte
   coating layers with electron-donating groups were designed to bind
   lithium polysulfides. An ester group with a high spatial density was
   shown to be a strong candidate to bind lithium polysulfides.
   Spectroscopic evidence for the presence of lithium bonds between the
   lithium polysulfides and the electrondonating groups is reported for the
   first time. An electrochemical charge/discharge model is also proposed,
   which can explain the electrochemical behavior within the insulating
   polymer layer.}},

Abstract = {{A simple unconventional reservoir model is developed that accounts for
   complex physics affecting production from hydraulically-fractured wells
   in shale resources. Integrating these physics and evaluating their order
   of importance on future production of an unconventional reservoir is
   very essential. The proposed model divides the formation into three
   zones, rock matrix (I), induced-fracture (II) and hydraulic fracture
   (III) that hold varying characteristics. Also, a history matching
   process with Marcellus shale field production data is performed in order
   to obtain the most uncertain parameters defined in the model. Results
   showed that combined effect of permeability losses of hydraulic and
   induced-fracture zones results in 15\% gas production drop in 30 years.
   It is also concluded that the minimum ingredients required for long-term
   production forecast of unconventional shale gas reservoirs are
   considering two physics; shale surface methane desorption along with
   pressure-dependent permeability for fracture network and other physical
   phenomena are inconsequential.}},

Abstract = {{Conducting polymer hydrogels are emerging as a promising class of
   polymeric materials for various technological applications, especially

   3D hierarchical porous nanostructures, resulting in high electrical
   conductivity, large surface area, structural tunability and hierarchical
   porosity for rapid mass/charge transport. The newly developed conducting
   polymer hydrogels exhibit high performance when applied as active
   electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors or as functional

Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{181-192}},
Abstract = {{Grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements
   reveal that superlattices of 1.7 nm diameter, gold (Au) nanocrystals
   capped with octadecanethiol become significantly more ordered when
   heated to moderate temperatures (50-60 degrees C). This enhancement in
   order is reversible and the superlattice returns to its initially
   disordered structure when cooled back to room temperature.
   Disorder-order transition temperatures were estimated from the GISAXS
   data using the Hansen-Verlet criterion. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the superlattices exhibited exotherms
   (associated with disordering during cooling) and endotherms (associated
   with ordering during heating) near the transition temperatures. The
   superlattice transition temperatures also correspond approximately to
   the melting and solidification points of octadecanethiol. Therefore, it
   appears that a change in capping ligand packing that occurs upon ligand
   melting underlies the structural transition of the superlattices. We
   liken the heat-induced ordering of the superlattices to an inverse
   melting transition.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{14750-14758}},
Abstract = {{VO2 (B) is an interesting cathode candidate in lithium-ion batteries
   with a high theoretical capacity and fast charge/mass transfer rate.
   Most of the studies on this material have focused on the lithium
   insertion reaction in the range of 4.0-1.0 V. In this paper, VO2/rGO
   nanocomposite was prepared by a microwave-assisted solvothermal method
   and investigated in both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries as a
   potential anode. The VO2 (B) nanorods have an average diameter of
   similar to 200 nm, and is encapsulated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
   nanosheets. Electrochemical results reveal that the VO2/rGO electrodes
   exhibit stable cycling and good rate performance in both Li and Na
   cells. Reversible capacities of 400 mA h g(-1) over 400 cycles (vs.
   Li/Li+) and 200 mA h g(-1) over 200 cycles (vs. Na/Na+) have been
   achieved, indicating it is potential as an anode candidate either in
   lithium- or sodium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the reaction mechanisms
   seem to be different in Li and Na cells. The crystal structure of VO2
   (B) is maintained at a low discharge potential of 0.05 V in lithium-ion
   cells, while phase amorphization occurs in sodium-ion cells below 0.5 V.
   This result is consistent with the previous study on TiO2, further
   confirming that some stable metal oxides may show rather different
   behaviors in Na cells than expected.}},

Abstract = {{High energy density Li-S batteries are a promising green battery
   chemistry, but polysulfide shuttling and lithium anode degradation

   electrolytes and safe operation of Li-S batteries. Moreover, a

Pages = {{15683-15691}},
Abstract = {{The development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery technology is
   experiencing a critical challenge due to the migration of the soluble
   polysulfide species from the cathode to the lithium-metal anode which
   results in poor cyclability of the cell. To overcome the above issue,
   use of lithium-ion conductive membranes instead of the traditional
   porous Celgard membrane as the separator/electrolyte is one of the
   promising approaches. In this study, a lithiated Nafion membrane is used
   as a cation-selective electrolyte for Li-S batteries to suppress the
   polysulfide diffusion. An advanced cathode structure containing a
   high-surface activated carbon nanofiber (AC-CNF) current collector
   filled with dissolved lithium polysulfides and a thin AC-CNF upper

Abstract = {{Here we report on dramatic and favorable changes to the operating
   characteristics in monolayer graphene field-effect transistors (FETs)
   exposed to vapor-phase, polar organic molecules in ambient. These
   changes include significant reduction of the Dirac voltage, accompanied
   by both an increase in electron and hole mobility, mu, and a decrease in
   residual carrier density, N-0, to < 3 x 10(11) cm(-2). In contrast to
   graphene FET modulation with various liquid- and solid-phase dielectric
   media present in the literature, we attribute these changes to screening
   by polar vapor-phase molecules of fields induced by charged impurities
   and defects, n(imp), in or near the active layer. The magnitude of the
   changes produced in the graphene FET parameters scales remarkably well
   with the dipole moment of the delivered molecules. These effects are
   reversible, a unique advantage of working in the vapor phase. The
   changes observed upon polar molecule delivery are analogous to those
   produced by depositing and annealing fluoropolymer coatings on graphene
   that have been reported previously, and we attribute these changes to
   similar charge screening or neutralization phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-narrow linewidth in the extinction spectrum of noble metal
   nanoparticle arrays induced by the lattice plasmon resonances (LPRs) is
   of great significance for applications in plasmonic lasers and plasmonic
   sensors. However, the challenge of sustaining LPRs in an asymmetric
   environment greatly restricts their practical applications, especially
   for high-performance on-chip plasmonic sensors. Herein, we fully study
   the parallel plasmonic-photonic interactions in both the Au nanodisk
   arrays (NDAs) and the core/shell SiO2/Au nanocylinder arrays (NCAs).
   Different from the dipolar interactions in the conventionally studied
   orthogonal coupling, the horizontal propagating electric field
   introduces the out-of-plane ``hot spots{''} and results in electric
   field delocalization. Through controlling the aspect ratio to manipulate
   the ``hot spot{''} distributions of the localized surface plasmon
   resonances (LSPRs) in the NCAs, we demonstrate a high-performance
   refractive index sensor with a wide dynamic range of refractive indexes
   ranging from 1.0 to 1.5. Both high figure of merit (FOM) and high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be maintained under these detectable
   refractive indices. Furthermore, the electromagnetic field distributions
   confirm that the high FOM in the wide dynamic range is attributed to the
   parallel coupling between the superstrate diffraction orders and the
   height-induced LSPR modes. Our study on the near-field ``hot-spot{''}
   engineering and far-field parallel coupling paves the way towards
   improved understanding of the parallel LPRs and the design of
   high-performance on-chip refractive index sensors.}},

Abstract = {{As traffic volumes increase, bridges age, and maintenance budgets are
   cut, transportation officials often need quantitative data to
   distinguish between bridges that can be kept safely in service and those
   that need to be replaced or retrofitted. Strain gages can be utilized to
   evaluate fatigue damage in steel bridges using the techniques that are
   discussed in this paper. To evaluate fatigue damage, the cycles induced
   by vehicular traffic must be quantified using a cycle-counting
   algorithm, such as a rainflow algorithm. The amount of fatigue damage
   induced during the monitoring period can then be calculated using the
   traditional method, the effective stress range, or using a new approach
   based on the index stress range. One distinct advantage of the proposed
   method is that the relative amount of fatigue damage accumulated at
   different locations along the bridge can be easily compared. The
   advantages and limitations of both methods are demonstrated using
   measured data from a fracture-critical steel bridge.}},

Abstract = {{Observation and quantification of the Earth's surface is undergoing a
   revolutionary change due to the increased spatial resolution and extent
   afforded by light detection and ranging (lidar) technology. As a
   consequence, lidar-derived information has led to fundamental
   discoveries within the individual disciplines of geomorphology,
   hydrology, and ecology. These disciplines form the cornerstones of
   critical zone (CZ) science, where researchers study how interactions
   among the geosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere shape and maintain the
   `zone of life', which extends from the top of unweathered bedrock to the
   top of the vegetation canopy. Fundamental to CZ science is the
   development of transdisciplinary theories and tools that transcend
   disciplines and inform other's work, capture new levels of complexity,
   and create new intellectual outcomes and spaces. Researchers are just
   beginning to use lidar data sets to answer synergistic,
   transdisciplinary questions in CZ science, such as how CZ processes
   co-evolve over long timescales and interact over shorter timescales to
   create thresholds, shifts in states and fluxes of water, energy, and
   carbon. The objective of this review is to elucidate the transformative
   potential of lidar for CZ science to simultaneously allow for
   quantification of topographic, vegetative, and hydrological processes. A
   review of 147 peer-reviewed lidar studies highlights a lack of lidar
   applications for CZ studies as 38 \% of the studies were focused in
   geomorphology, 18 \% in hydrology, 32 \% in ecology, and the remaining
   12 \% had an interdisciplinary focus. A handful of exemplar
   transdisciplinary studies demonstrate lidar data sets that are
   well-integrated with other observations can lead to fundamental advances
   in CZ science, such as identification of feedbacks between hydrological
   and ecological processes over hillslope scales and the synergistic
   co-evolution of landscape-scale CZ structure due to interactions amongst
   carbon, energy, and water cycles. We propose that using lidar to its
   full potential will require numerous advances, including new and more
   powerful open-source processing tools, exploiting new lidar acquisition
   technologies, and improved integration with physically based models and
   complementary in situ and remote-sensing observations. We provide a
   5-year vision that advocates for the expanded use of lidar data sets and
   highlights subsequent potential to advance the state of CZ science.}},

   fields}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{11363-11370}},
Abstract = {{Recently, we reported an innovative type of micromotors consisting of
   nanowires as rotors and patterned Au/Ni/Cr nanodisks as bearings. The
   dimensions of micromotors were less than 1 mu m, and could continuously
   rotate for 15 hours over 240 000 cycles. To understand the limitation of
   their lifetime, we systematically investigated the rotation dynamics by
   analytical modeling and determined the time-dependent torques and forces
   involved in the rotation. From the forces and torques, the extent of
   wear of micromotors was successfully derived, which agreed well with the
   experimental characterization. The results also proved that the
   frictional force linearly increases with the loading in such rotary
   nanodevices operating in suspension, consistent with the prediction of
   the non-adhesive multi-asperity friction theory. With these
   understandings, we enhanced the design of micromotors and achieved an
   operation lifetime of 80 hours and over 1.1 million total rotation
   cycles. This research, shedding new light on the frictional mechanism of
   recently reported nanowire micromotors with demonstration of the most
   durable rotary nanomechanical devices of similar dimensions to the best
   of our knowledge, can be inspiring for innovative design of future
   nanomechanical devices with ultra-long lifetime for practical
   applications.}},

Title = {{Optical properties of laser sintered polyamide 12}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{443-448}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report selected optical
   properties of laser sintered polyamide 12 blank plates under different
   monochromatic and white light conditions and to apply these properties
   in production of laser sintered lithophanes.
   Design/methodology/approach - A UNICO 1201E spectrophotometer was used
   to measure the transmittance of laser sintered polyamide 12 plates as a
   function of plate thickness. Monochromatic light-emitting diodes were
   used to assess the wavelength dependence on the transmission and
   contrast as captured by a SONY DSC-W55 camera.
   Findings - The transmittance decreased with increasing plate thickness
   which varied significantly depending on the monochromatic wavelength.
   Highest transmission was observed using green light (525 nm) and poorest
   transmission was measured for yellow light (589 nm).
   Research limitations/implications - There is a limit to the amount of
   contrast obtained in polyamide lithophanes because the thickness of the
   plates is limited to less than about 5 mm. Greater thickness results in
   discernible topology on the lithophane which impairs the quality of the
   image.
   Originality/value - Light transmittance of polyamide 12 plates under
   different lighting conditions is reported and applied to optically
   defined laser sintered lithophanes.}},

Title = {{An Inexact Newton-Krylov Algorithm for Constrained Diffeomorphic Image
   Registration}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1030-1069}},
Abstract = {{We propose numerical algorithms for solving large deformation
   diffeomorphic image registration problems. We formulate the nonrigid
   image registration problem as a problem of optimal control. This leads
   to an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE)
   constrained optimization problem. The PDE constraint consists, in its
   simplest form, of a hyperbolic transport equation for the evolution of
   the image intensity. The control variable is the velocity field.
   Tikhonov regularization on the control ensures well-posedness. We
   consider standard smoothness regularization based on H-1- or
   H-2-seminorms. We augment this regularization scheme with a constraint
   on the divergence of the velocity field (control variable) rendering the
   deformation incompressible (Stokes regularization scheme) and thus
   ensuring that the determinant of the deformation gradient is equal to
   one, up to the numerical error. We use a Fourier pseudospectral
   discretization in space and a Chebyshev pseudospectral discretization in
   time. The latter allows us to reduce the number of unknowns and enables
   the time-adaptive inversion for nonstationary velocity fields. We use a
   preconditioned, globalized, matrix-free, inexact Newton-Krylov method
   for numerical optimization. A parameter continuation is designed to
   estimate an optimal regularization parameter. Regularity is ensured by
   controlling the geometric properties of the deformation field. Overall,
   we arrive at a black-box solver that exploits computational tools that
   are precisely tailored for solving the optimality system. We study
   spectral properties of the Hessian, grid convergence, numerical
   accuracy, computational efficiency, and deformation regularity of our
   scheme. We compare the designed Newton-Krylov methods with a globalized
   Picard method (preconditioned gradient descent). We study the influence
   of a varying number of unknowns in time. The reported results
   demonstrate excellent numerical accuracy, guaranteed local deformation
   regularity, and computational efficiency with an optional control on
   local mass conservation. The Newton-Krylov methods clearly outperform
   the Picard method if high accuracy of the inversion is required. Our
   method provides equally good results for stationary and nonstationary
   velocity fields for two-image registration problems.}},

Title = {{A reduced-complexity model for river delta formation - Part 1: Modeling
   deltas with channel dynamics}},
Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{67-86}},
Abstract = {{In this work we develop a reduced-complexity model (RCM) for river delta
   formation (referred to as DeltaRCM in the following). It is a rule-based
   cellular morphodynamic model, in contrast to reductionist models based
   on detailed computational fluid dynamics. The basic framework of this
   model (DeltaRCM) consists of stochastic parcel-based cellular routing
   schemes for water and sediment and a set of phenomenological rules for
   sediment deposition and erosion. The outputs of the model include a
   depth-averaged flow field, water surface elevation and bed topography
   that evolve in time. Results show that DeltaRCM is able (1) to resolve a
   wide range of channel dynamics - including elongation, bifurcation,
   avulsion and migration - and (2) to produce a variety of deltas such as
   alluvial fan deltas and deltas with multiple orders of bifurcations. We
   also demonstrate a simple stratigraphy recording component which tracks
   the distribution of coarse and fine materials and the age of the
   deposits. Essential processes that must be included in
   reduced-complexity delta models include a depth-averaged flow field that
   guides sediment transport a nontrivial water surface profile that
   accounts for backwater effects at least in the main channels, both
   bedload and suspended sediment transport, and topographic steering of
   sediment transport.}},

Abstract = {{In a companion paper (Liang et al., 2015) we introduced a
   reduced-complexity model (RCM) for river delta formation, developed
   using a parcel-based ``weighted random walk{''} method for routing water
   and sediment flux. This model (referred to as DeltaRCM) consists of a
   flow routing scheme as the hydrodynamic component (referred to as
   FlowRCM) and a set of sediment transport rules as the morphodynamic
   component. In this work, we assess the performance of FlowRCM via a
   series of hydrodynamic tests by comparing the model outputs to Delft3D
   and theoretical predictions. These tests are designed to reveal the
   capability of FlowRCM to resolve flow field features that are critical
   to delta dynamics at the level of channel processes. In particular, we
   focus on (1) backwater profile, (2) flow around a mouth bar, (3) flow
   through a single bifurcation, and (4) flow through a distributary
   channel network. We show that while the simple rules are not able to
   reproduce all fine-scale flow structures, FlowRCM captures flow field
   features that are essential to deltaic processes such as bifurcations
   and avulsions, the partitioning of flux between channels and inundated
   islands, and the instability of flux distribution at channel mouths
   which is responsible for mouth-bar growth. Finally, we discuss
   advantages and limitations of FlowRCM and identify environments most
   suitable for it.}},

Abstract = {{ABO(3) perovskites have fascinated solid-state chemists and physicists
   for decades because they display a seemingly inexhaustible variety of
   chemical and physical properties. However, despite the diversity of
   properties found among perovskites, very few of these materials are
   ferroelectric, or even polar, in bulk. In this Perspective, we highlight
   recent theoretical and experimental studies that have shown how a
   combination of non-polar structural distortions, commonly tilts or
   rotations of the BO6 octahedra, can give rise to polar structures or
   ferroelectricity in several families of layered perovskites. We discuss
   the crystal chemical origin of the polarization in each of these
   families - which emerges through a so-called `trilinear coupling' or
   `hybrid improper' mechanism - and emphasize areas in which further
   theoretical and experimental investigation is needed. We also consider
   how this mechanism may provide a generic route for designing not only
   new ferroelectrics, but also materials with various other
   multifunctionalities, such as magnetoelectrics and electric
   field-controllable metal-insulator transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Sand-particle-size distributions (PSDs) are used for various purposes in
   sand control: for example, decision making between various sand-control
   techniques and sizing of the filter media (sand screens and/or gravel
   packs) through either rule of thumb or physical experiments or
   theoretical models. PSDs of formation-sand samples are also often used
   to generate ``simulated{''} formation sand for laboratory experiments.
   The two most commonly used techniques for PSD measurements are sieve and
   laser. Although some engineers use one technique for no obvious or
   justifiable reasons, others use both techniques for measurements and do
   not know what to do with the data when significant differences exist in
   PSDs obtained from each technique. Although the inherent limitations of
   (and the differences between), these two techniques as well as other
   factors affecting the measurements are well-known, a systematic study as
   to which of these two techniques is relevant to sand-control-screen
   selection and why is lacking.
   In this study, we critically review the current practices in PSD
   determination and the use (and misuse) of the information obtained from
   these measurements, propose a methodology toward determining what is
   relevant under gradual-formation-failure conditions for wire-wrap
   screen, discuss when it should be used and why, and present initial
   experimental results that support our conclusions.}},

Title = {{Tubing Anchors Can Reduce Production Rates and Pump Fillage}},
Journal = {{SPE PRODUCTION \& OPERATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{156-163}},
Abstract = {{Modern completion techniques have greatly increased the production-rate
   capability of wells. Many wells have the potential to produce more
   liquid and gas, but the use of tubing anchors in certain wellbore
   locations chokes the gas flow up the casing and results in increased
   backpressure against the formation, which restricts production from the
   well. A gaseous liquid column can form above the tubing anchor and cause
   high pressure in the gas below the tubing anchor that restricts the
   liquid and gas flow from the reservoir.
   Often, low pump fillage and low production rates are blamed on a poor
   gas separator, when actually the separator is operating efficiently and
   is separating the liquid from the gas. In the condition described, all
   of the liquid in the wellbore below the tubing anchor falls to the pump
   and is being removed by the pump. The problem is that high pressure in
   the gas column below the tubing anchor is restricting production from
   the well. Additional production is available if the high pressure that
   is restricting production from the formation is removed. The
   accumulation of a gaseous liquid column above the tubing anchor when
   constant low pump fillage is observed indicates that liquid exists above
   the tubing anchor whereas only free gas exists from the tubing anchor
   down to the pump. Limited liquid production falls down the casing wall,
   while the casing annulus is almost completely filled with gas if the
   pump is set below the formation (McCoy et al. 2013).
   Field testing with automated fluid-level-measurement equipment to
   perform liquid-depression tests verifies that a gaseous liquid column
   exists (Rowlan et al. 2008) above the tubing anchor and a gas column
   exists below the tubing anchor in wells with high fluid levels, with low
   pump fillage, and with the tubing anchor located above the pump. These
   field data were acquired on several wells and are shown to verify the
   preceding analysis of the well's performance. This fluid-distribution
   condition is not generally known. Locating the tubing anchor below the
   pump prevents this condition and will improve production in these wells.}},

Title = {{Using metaheuristics to optimize the combination of classifier and
   cluster ensembles}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{229-242}},
Abstract = {{We investigate how to make a simpler version of an existing algorithm,
   named (CE)-E-3, from Consensus between Classification and Clustering
   Ensembles, more user-friendly by automatically tuning its main
   parameters with the use of metaheuristics. In particular, (CE)-E-3 based
   on a Squared Loss function, (CE)-E-3-SL, assumes an optimization
   procedure that takes as input class membership estimates from existing
   classifiers, as well as a similarity matrix from a cluster ensemble
   operating solely on the new target data, to provide a consolidated
   classification of the target data. To do so, two parameters have to be
   defined a priori, namely: the relative importance of classifier and
   cluster ensembles and the number of iterations of the algorithm. In some
   practical applications, these parameters can be optimized via time
   consuming grid search approaches based on cross-validation procedures.
   This paper shows that seven metaheuristics for parameter optimization
   yield classifiers as accurate as those obtained from grid search, but
   taking half the running time. More precisely, and by assuming a

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a phase-contrast MRI based
   technique that allows quantitative, noninvasive assessment of the
   mechanical properties of tissues by the introduction of shear waves into
   the body and measurement of the resulting displacements. In MRE, the
   calculated stiffness values are affected by noise, which is amplified by
   the inversion process. It would be useful to know that beyond some SNR
   threshold, the stiffness values are accurate within some confidence
   limit. The most common methods to calculate SNR values in MRE are
   variations of displacement SNR, which estimate the noise in the measured
   displacement. However, the accuracy of stiffness determination depends
   not only on the displacement SNR, but also on the wavelength of the
   shear wave, in turn dependent on the stiffness of the underlying
   material. More recently, the SNR of the octahedral shear strain (OSS)
   has been proposed as a more appropriate measure, since shear deformation
   is the signal in MRE. We also propose here another measure based on the
   SNR of the Laplacian of the data, since this is the most noise sensitive
   quantity calculated when performing direct inversion of the Helmholtz
   equation. The three SNR measures were compared on simulated data for
   materials of different stiffness with varying amounts of noise using
   three inversion algorithms commonly used in MRE (phase gradient, local
   frequency estimation, and direct inversion). We demonstrate that the
   proper SNR measure for MRE depends on the inversion algorithm used, and,
   more precisely, on the order of derivatives used in the inversion
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Unsupervised models can provide supplementary soft constraints to help
   classify new data since similar instances are more likely to share the
   same class label. In this context, this paper reports on a study on how
   to make an existing algorithm, named (CE)-E-3 (from consensus between
   classification and clustering ensembles), more convenient by
   automatically tuning its main parameters. The (CE)-E-3 algorithm is
   based on a general optimisation framework that takes as input class
   membership estimates from existing classifiers, and a similarity matrix
   from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the new (target) data to be
   classified, in order to yield a consensus labelling of the new data. To
   do so, two parameters have to be defined a priori by the user: the
   relative importance of classifier and cluster ensembles, and the number
   of iterations of the algorithm. We propose a differential evolution (DE)
   algorithm, named dynamic DE ((DE)-E-2), which is a computationally
   efficient alternative for optimising such parameters. (DE)-E-2 provides
   better results than DE by dynamically updating its control parameters.
   Moreover, competitive results were achieved when comparing (DE)-E-2 with
   three state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Abstract = {{While many synthesis methods have been reported for Co3O4-carbon
   nanocomposites as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in
   alkaline solutions, the individual contributions of Co3O4 and CNW
   towards ORR and OER are still not clear. Here, we report the individual
   functionality of Co3O4 and the N-doped carbon nanoweb (CNW) in ORR and
   OER. The Co3O4/CNW bifunctional catalysts were synthesized by an in situ
   growth of Co precursors onto CNW followed by a controlled heat
   treatment. The specific functions of Co3O4 and CNW were delineated by
   rotating disk electrode measurements. It was found that Co3O4 alone
   exhibited poor ORR catalytic activity. However, in the presence of CNW,
   Co3O4 assisted the selective four-electron oxygen reduction over the
   two-electron pathway. Analyses of the Tafel slope and reaction order
   suggested that Co3O4 acted as the primary catalytic site for OER. CNW
   improved the electronic conduction between Co3O4 and the current
   collector. CNW underwent serious degradation at the high potential of
   the OER but its stability improved greatly upon the deposition of Co3O4.
   Two possible mechanisms for the improved catalytic stability are
   discussed. The findings demonstrate the specific functions of Co3O4 and
   CNW in catalyzing the OER and ORR and further establish an understanding
   of the synergy of the composite in electrocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{New automated methods are developed for identifying narrow landscape
   features that cause hydrodynamic blocking and might have critical
   impacts for management models of river flooding, coastal inundation,
   climate change, or extreme event analysis. Lidar data processed into a
   fine-resolution raster (1m x 1 m) can resolve narrow blocking features
   in topography but typically cannot be directly used for hydrodynamic
   modeling. For practical applications such data are abstracted to larger
   scales, which can result in a loss of hydrodynamic blocking effects. The
   traditional approach to resolving hydrodynamic blocking features is to
   represent them as cell boundaries within a customized unstructured grid
   that is tuned to the spatial features. A new automated edge-blocking
   approach is developed, which allows application of an arbitrarily
   structured (Cartesian) mesh at coarser scales and provides contiguous
   representation of blocking features along Cartesian cell boundaries.
   This approach distorts the shape of a blocking feature (i.e., making it
   rectilinear along grid cell faces) but retains its critical hydrodynamic
   blocking height characteristics and spatial continuity within the
   topographic model.}},

Abstract = {{Nanosculpting, the fabrication of two-and three-dimensional shapes at
   the nanoscale, enables applications in photonics, metamaterials,
   multi-bit magnetic memory, and bio-nanoparticles. A promising high
   resolution and high throughput method for nanosculpting is nanoimprint
   lithography (NIL). A key requirement to achieving manufacturing
   viability of nanosculptures in NIL is maintaining image fidelity through
   each step of the imprinting process. In particular, polymer
   densification during UV curing can distort the imprinted image. Here we
   study the shape changes introduced by polymer densification and develop
   a forward method for predicting changes in nanoscale geometries from UV
   curing. We show that shape changes by polymer densification are governed
   by the Poisson's ratio, the shrinkage coefficient of the polymer resist,
   and the geometric aspect ratios of the nanosculpted shape. We also show
   that the size of the residual layer does not impact the final profile of
   the imprinted shape.}},

Abstract = {{In the past thirty years, the development of compositional reservoir
   simulators using an equation of state (EOS) has been addressed in the

   compositional EOS-based simulator in conjunction with unstructured
   meshes has been developed. In this model, an equation of state is used
   for equilibrium calculations among phases. Also, the physical properties
   are calculated based on an EOS, hence obviating the need for using steam
   tables for calculation of water/steam properties. The governing
   equations for the model comprise fugacity equations, material balance,
   pore volume constraint and energy equation. The governing partial
   differential equations are solved using the EbFVM (Element based Finite
   Volume Method). Results for several case studies consisting of 2D and 3D
   reservoirs are presented in order to demonstrate the applicability of

Abstract = {{It is resource-intensive to conduct human studies for task-based
   assessment of medical image quality and system optimization. Thus,
   numerical model observers have been developed as a surrogate for human
   observers. The Hotelling observer (HO) is the optimal linear observer
   for signal-detection tasks, but the high dimensionality of imaging data
   results in a heavy computational burden. Channelization is often used to
   approximate the HO through a dimensionality reduction step, but how to
   produce channelized images without losing significant image information
   remains a key challenge. Kernel local Fisher discriminant analysis
   (KLFDA) uses kernel techniques to perform supervised dimensionality
   reduction, which finds an embedding transformation that maximizes
   between-class separability and preserves within-class local structure in
   the low-dimensional manifold. It is powerful for classification tasks,
   especially when the distribution of a class is multimodal. Such
   multimodality could be observed in many practical clinical tasks. For
   example, primary and metastatic lesions may both appear in medical
   imaging studies, but the distributions of their typical characteristics
   (e.g., size) may be very different. In this study, we propose to use
   KLFDA as a novel channelization method. The dimension of the embedded
   manifold (i.e., the result of KLFDA) is a counterpart to the number of
   channels in the state-of-art linear channelization. We present a
   simulation study to demonstrate the potential usefulness of KLFDA for
   building the channelized HOs (CHOs) and generating reliable decision
   statistics for clinical tasks. We show that the performance of the CHO
   with KLFDA channels is comparable to that of the benchmark CHOs.}},

Abstract = {{The capabilities and limitations of angular scatterometry for a
   structure pitch much less than the optical wavelength are experimentally
   investigated using a 100-nm pitch Al-wire grid polarizer on a SiO2
   substrate. Three CW laser sources of wavelengths (244 nm, 405 nm and 633
   nm) are used to measure the 0-order diffraction (reflection) across an
   incident angle range of 8 degrees to 80 degrees. The grating profile is
   defined by seven parameters (pitch, bottom linewidth, top linewidth,
   fused silica undercut, Al thickness, horizontal and vertical extent of
   top rounding). Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) simulations show
   that the reflectivity versus angle results are sensitive to changes in
   all of these parameters. The simulations act as a baseline library for
   the scatterometry measurements. Fitting the experimental curves with the
   corresponding simulation parameters results in a determination of the
   grating profile. As expected the shorter wavelength measurements provide
   the most sensitivity, but good precision is obtained at all three
   wavelengths. The measurements are in good agreement with destructive
   cross section scanning electron microscopy measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating photonic waveguide sensors with microfluidics is promising
   in achieving high-sensitivity and cost-effective biological and chemical
   sensing applications. One challenge in the integration is that an air
   gap would exist between the microfluidic channel and the photonic
   waveguide when the micro-channel and the waveguide intersect. The air
   gap creates a path for the fluid to leak out of the micro-channel.
   Potential solutions, such as oxide deposition followed by surface
   planarization, would introduce additional fabrication steps and thus are
   ineffective in cost. Here we propose a reliable and efficient approach
   for achieving closed microfluidic channels on a waveguide sensing chip.
   The core of the employed technique is to add waveguide crossings, i.e.,
   perpendicularly intersecting waveguides, to block the etched trenches
   and prevent the fluid from leaking through the air gap. The waveguide
   crossings offer a smooth interface for microfluidic channel bonding
   while bring negligible additional propagation loss (0.024 dB/crossing
   based on simulation). They are also efficient in fabrication, which are
   patterned and fabricated in the same step with waveguides. We
   experimentally integrated microfluidic channels with photonic crystal
   (PC) microcavity sensor chips on silicon-on-insulator substrate and
   demonstrated leak-free sensing measurement with waveguide crossings. The
   microfluidic channel was made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and
   pressure bonded to the silicon chip. The tested flow rates can be varied
   from 0.2 mu L/min to 200 mu L/min. Strong resonances from the PC cavity
   were observed from the transmission spectra. The spectra also show that
   the waveguide crossings did not induce any significant additional loss
   or alter the resonances.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to deliver therapeutic healthcare remotely relying on
   pervasive computing technologies requires addressing real research
   challenges ranging from sensing people and their interactions with the
   environment to software abstractions to move data from low-level signals
   into representations that are understandable and manipulatable by domain
   experts who are not computer scientists. In this position paper, we
   inspect the potential for immersive physiotherapy, just one of many
   potential application of real smart health. The time is right for
   delivering real services for immersive physiotherapy, as many
   technological solutions for remote monitoring of patients and their
   interactions are ready for prime time. In this paper, we take a critical
   look at remaining tasks, to propose novel concepts for data processing
   and service delivery of remote physiotherapy applications. We go beyond
   the obvious integration tasks to uncover real and tangible research
   challenges that are solvable in the near term and, when solved, will
   make the vision of immersive physiotherapy possible.}},

Abstract = {{While superresolution optical microscopy techniques afford enhanced
   resolution for biological applications, they have largely been used to
   study structures in isolated cells. We use the FDTD method to simulate
   the propagation of focused beams for STED microscopy through multiple
   biological cells. We model depletion beams that provide 2D and 3D
   confinement of the fluorescence spot and assess the effective PSF of the
   system as a function of focal depth. We compare the relative size of the
   STED effective PSF under one- and two-photon excitation. PSF
   calculations suggest that imaging is possible up to the maximum
   simulation depth if the fluorescence emission remains detectable.}},

Abstract = {{As a newly developed assay for the detection of endogenous enzyme
   activity at the single-catalytic-event level, Rolling Circle Enhanced
   Enzyme Activity Detection (REEAD) has been used to measure enzyme
   activity in both single human cells and malaria-causing parasites,
   Plasmodium sp. Current REEAD assays rely on organic dye-tagged linear
   DNA probes to report the rolling circle amplification products (RCPs),
   the cost of which may hinder the widespread use of REEAD. Here we show
   that a new class of activatable probes, NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs), can
   simplify the REEAD assays. Easily prepared without any need for
   purification and capable of large fluorescence enhancement upon
   hybridization, NCBs are cost-effective and sensitive. Compared to
   conventional fluorescent probes, NCBs are also more photostable. As
   demonstrated in reporting the human topoisomerases I (hTopI)
   cleavage-ligation reaction, the proposed NCBs suggest a read-out format
   attractive for future REEAD-based diagnostics.}},

   provide the possibility to quantum engineer one of the largest known

   show that by coupling of electromagnetic modes in plasmonic metasurfaces
   with quantum-engineered intersubband transitions in semiconductor
   heterostructures one can create ultra-thin highly-nonlinear metasurfaces
   for normal light incidence. Structures discussed here represent a novel
   kind of hybrid metal-semiconductor metamaterials in which exotic optical
   properties are produced by coupling electromagnetically-engineered modes
   in dielectric and plasmonic nanostructures with quantum-engineered
   intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures. Record
   values of effective optical nonlinearities of over 400 nm/V are
   experimentally measured for metasurfaces optimized for efficient second
   harmonic generation at 9.7 mu m pump wavelength under normal incidence.}},

Abstract = {{We present a fast algorithm for kernel summation problems in high
   dimensions. Such problems appear in computational physics, numerical
   approximation, nonparametric statistics, and machine learning. In our
   context, the sums depend on a kernel function that is a pair potential
   defined on a dataset of points in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. A
   direct evaluation of the sum scales quadratically with the number of
   points. Fast kernel summation methods can reduce this cost to linear
   complexity, but the constants involved do not scale well with the
   dimensionality of the dataset. The main algorithmic components of fast
   kernel summation algorithms are the separation of the kernel sum between
   near and far field (which is the basis for pruning) and the efficient
   and accurate approximation of the far field. We introduce novel methods
   for pruning and for approximating the far field. Our far field
   approximation requires only kernel evaluations and does not use analytic
   expansions. Pruning is not done using bounding boxes but rather
   combinatorially using a sparsified nearest-neighbor graph of the input
   distribution. The time complexity of our algorithm depends linearly on
   the ambient dimension. The error in the algorithm depends on the
   low-rank approximability of the far field, which in turn depends on the
   kernel function and on the intrinsic dimensionality of the distribution
   of the points. The error of the far field approximation does not depend
   on the ambient dimension. We present the new algorithm along with
   experimental results that demonstrate its performance. As a highlight,
   we report results for Gaussian kernel sums for 100 million points in 64
   dimensions, for one million points in 1000 dimensions, and for problems
   in which the Gaussian kernel has a variable bandwidth. To the best of
   our knowledge, all of these experiments are prohibitively expensive with
   existing fast kernel summation methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present experimental and theoretical studies on the
   bending induced resonance shift of a photonic crystal cavity. The
   photonic crystal devices are fabricated on a 2cm x 2cm large-area single
   crystal SiNM which is transferred defect-freely onto a Kapton substrate
   with an SU-8 bottom cladding. Photonic crystal tapers are implemented at
   the strip-photonic crystal waveguide interfaces, which lowers the
   coupling loss and enables operation closer to the band edge.
   Subwavelength grating (SWG) couplers are employed at the input and
   output of the device in order to enable device characterization. The
   device is mounted on the two jaws of a caliper and it can be buckled up
   and down through sliding one of the jaws. The bending radius at the top
   of the curvature can be estimated with the length of the specimen and
   the distance between the two jaws. A minimum bending radius of 5 mm is
   achieved. Finite element method (FEM) is used to simulate the
   deformation and the strain of the nanomembrane. The results are used as
   the input of finitedifference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. The
   analysis shows that the strain sensitivities are 0.673 pm/mu epsilon,
   0.656 pm/mu epsilon, 0.588 pm/mu epsilon, and 0.591 pm/mu epsilon for
   longitudinal face-out, longitudinal face-in, transverse face-out, and
   transverse face-in bending, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{3D single-particle tracking (SPT) has been a pivotal tool to furthering
   our understanding of dynamic cellular processes in complex biological
   systems, with a molecular localization accuracy (10-100 nm) often better
   than the diffraction limit of light. However, current SPT techniques
   utilize either CCDs or a confocal detection scheme which not only suffer
   from poor temporal resolution but also limit tracking to a depth less
   than one scattering mean free path in the sample ( typically <15 mu m).
   In this report we highlight our novel design for a spatiotemporally
   multiplexed two-photon microscope which is able to reach
   sub-diffraction-limit tracking accuracy and sub-millisecond temporal
   resolution, but with a dramatically extended SPT range of up to 200 mu m
   through dense cell samples. We have validated our microscope by tracking
   ( 1) fluorescent nanoparticles in a prescribed motion inside gelatin gel
   (with 1\% intralipid) and (2) labeled single EGFR complexes inside skin
   cancer spheroids (at least 8 layers of cells thick) for similar to 10
   minutes. Furthermore we discuss future capabilities of our multiplexed
   two-photon microscope design, specifically to the extension of (1)
   simultaneous multicolor tracking (i.e. spatiotemporal co-localization
   analysis) and (2) FRET studies (i.e. lifetime analysis). The high
   resolution, high depth penetration, and multicolor features of this
   microscope make it well poised to study a variety of molecular scale
   dynamics in the cell, especially related to cellular trafficking studies
   with in vitro tumor models and in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we introduced a novel and an etch-free solution based
   procedure utilizing a combination of imprinting and inkjet printing for
   developing polymer photonic devices to overcome the limitations of
   conventional polymer photonic device fabrication techniques, such as RIE
   or direct pattern writing. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility
   of developing very large-area photonic systems on both rigid and
   flexible substrates. Specifically, a complete reconfigurable 4-bit
   true-time-delay module, comprising of an array of five interconnected TO
   switches and polymer delay lines, with a dimension of 25 mm x 18 mm is
   developed. Because of the roll-to-roll (R2R) compatibility of the
   employed solution processing techniques, photonic system development
   over large areas at high-throughput on rigid or flexible substrates is
   possible, which will lead to tremendous cost savings. Moreover, these
   devices can be integrated with other printed photonic and electronic
   components, such as light sources, modulators, antennas, etc., on the
   same substrate, thus enabling integrated systems that can be conformably
   integrated on any platform.}},

Abstract = {{We present a compact light source designed for arrayed lab-on-chip cell
   imaging with the motivation of creating a microchip based system for
   detection of tumor cells. We aim at creating a multicolor light source
   that can be integrated for on-chip imaging. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs)
   were used as the emission layer due to their unique capabilities like
   multicolor emission, multiple available methods of electrical and photo
   excitation and compatibility with silicon fabrication were achieved.
   Micropatterning of QDs was used to create both electrically and photo
   excited light sources. We study the photo activated source as a robust,
   high intensity light source which can be easily integrated with
   lab-on-chip systems while requiring additional filters and excitation
   systems and compare it with an electrically excited source with the
   capability of individually addressable, multicolor sources on a single
   substrate eliminating the need for additional optical components. To
   demonstrate the efficacy of our design, we performed ex vivo
   transmission mode microscopy to evaluate the nucleus-cytoplasm ratios of
   cancer cells. We showed the capability of imaging of inner cell
   structures using multiple wavelengths to perform high contrast imaging
   and observation. We performed immunofluorescence excitation of MDA-MB
   231 cancer cells, cultured in a microwell array. Our method provides
   patterned multicolor light sources and low cost which are suitable for
   high-throughput microarray cellular imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Biocompatible Optical Needle Array (BONA) is showing to be a powerful
   tool complementing the novel antibacterial blue light therapy. BONA is
   able to deliver light to deeper skin tissue layers successfully as shown
   in experiments. In this study, we will discuss BONA's design, mechanical
   and optical properties, production method, plus propose improvements to
   optimize it all. A special skin phantom with photosensitizer was
   developed in order to investigate how light is delivered inside the
   tissue. The phantom shows the light scattering pattern through
   photobleach, allowing us to determine length, thickness and spacing
   between needles. Other quantitative optical properties as penetration
   depth were determined using a different phantom (using PDMS). Mechanical
   properties as needle resistance were determined using one axis of a
   custom biaxial tensile strain device. The results led us to conclude
   that besides the great results, there is still room for improvements
   regarding tip sharpness and manufacturing time and cost, which would be
   solved with the enhanced fabrication method proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the application of a modified Rayleigh-Lamb frequency
   equation (RLFE) to a noncontact optical coherence elastography (OCE)
   method for quantitative assessment of the biomechanical properties of a
   porcine cornea. A focused air-pulse induced an elastic wave in the
   cornea, which was imaged by a phase-stabilized optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) system. From the displacement data acquired by the OCT
   system, phase velocities of the mechanical wave were extracted by
   spectral analysis using a fast Fourier transform. Experiments were
   conducted on 2\% agar phantom samples, and the Young's moduli were
   assessed by the Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equation, which was validated
   using uniaxial mechanical compression testing. The Rayleigh-Lamb
   frequency equation was then applied to OCE data from a normal porcine
   cornea, in which the fluid-solid effect was considered. The Young's
   modulus of the porcine cornea was measured to be similar to 60 kPa and
   the shear viscosity was similar to 0.33 Pa.s. The combination of OCE and
   RLFE is a promising noninvasive method for the estimation of the
   biomechanical properties of the cornea in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we utilize a confocal ultrasound and phase-sensitive
   optical coherence elastography (OCE) system to assess age-related
   changes in biomechanical properties of the crystalline lens in intact
   rabbit eyes in situ. Low-amplitude elastic deformations, induced on the
   surface of the lens by localized acoustic radiation force, were measured
   using phase-sensitive OCT. The results demonstrate that the
   displacements induced in young rabbit lenses are significantly larger
   than those in the mature lenses. Temporal analyses of the elastic waves
   are also demonstrated significant difference between young and old
   lenses, indicating that the stiffness of lens increases with the age.
   These results demonstrate possibility of OCE for completely noninvasive
   analysis and quantification of lens biomechanical properties, which
   could be used in many clinical and basic science applications such as
   surgeries and studies on lens physiology and function.}},

Abstract = {{In on-chip optical interconnect, dielectric waveguide arrays are usually
   designed with pitches of a few wavelengths to avoid crosstalk, which
   greatly limits the integration density. In this paper, we for the first
   time propose to use multiple input multiple-output (MIMO), a well-known
   technique in wireless communication, to recover the data from entangled
   signals and reduce the waveguide pitch to subwavelength range. In the
   proposed on-chip MIMO system, there is significant coupling among the
   adjacent waveguides in the high density waveguide region. In order to
   recover signals, the NxN transmission matrix of N high-density
   waveguides is calculated to describe the relation between each input
   ports and output ports. In the receiving part, homodyne coherent
   receivers are used to receive the transmitted signals, and obtain the
   signal in phase and pi/2 out of phase with local oscillator. In the
   electrical signal processing, the inverse transmission matrix is
   utilized to recover the signals in the electronic domain. To verify the
   proposed on-chip MIMO, we used the INTERCONNECT package in Lumerical
   software to simulate a 10x10 MIMO system. The cross section of each
   waveguide is 500 nm x 220 nm. The spacing is 250 nm. The simulation
   verifies the possibility of recovering 10 Gbps data from the heavily
   coupled 10 waveguides with a BER better than 10(-12). The minimum input
   optical power for a BER of 10(-12) is greater than -18.1 dBm, and the
   maximum phase shift between input laser and local oscillator can reach
   to 73.5.}},

Abstract = {{Collecting accurate rutting data is important to assess network-level
   pavement conditions and to determine maintenance and rehabilitation
   needs and funding levels to optimize the use of available economic
   resources. The technical objective of this study was the assessment of
   the rut-depth (RD) accuracy and precision of different continuous
   automated systems (CASs), which represent the state-of-the-art for the
   automated data collection of rutting and discrete automated systems
   (DASs), which are still used by several departments of transportation in
   the United States. The RD values analyzed in this study were obtained
   by: (1) field measurements at highway speeds using five different
   optical CASs, and (2) calculation simulating the use of DASs with
   different configurations. The analysis of the first type of values
   assessed the closeness of the RD produced by the different CASs to the
   RD manually measured for this study. The analysis of the second type of
   values assessed the effects of the number of sensors and the width of
   measurement on the accuracy and precision of the DASs. In addition, the
   impact of the RD accuracy and precision on the assessed pavement
   condition at the network level was analyzed for both the CAS that
   participated in the experiment and the simulated DAS.}},

Abstract = {{The development of minimally invasive medical devices, which employ
   hyperthermic and/or cryothermic modalities to treat a variety of organ
   system diseases, is a rapidly expanding field. Consultation with a
   knowledgeable pathologist during the development of these devices is
   crucial, as characterization of the treated tissues can support the
   device's safety and future efficacy. The properties of thermally treated
   tissues often share a set of overlapping histopathologic
   characteristics, regardless of organ system. Several methods for
   optimally evaluating these thermal changes have been developed that
   depend on the tissue's post-treatment time interval. For devices
   associated with hyperthermic collagen denaturation, bright field or
   polarized light microscopy of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections can
   be utilized to assess thermal spread within the tissue. For applications
   resulting in collagen denaturation with associated desiccation,
   trichrome staining may provide additional information. For cryothermic
   devices, these collagen-based methods are generally less informative.
   Tetrazolium-based tissue viability staining (triphenyltetrazolium
   chloride, TTC; nitroblue tetrazolium, NBT; NADH/NADPH staining) can be
   used to assess for the presence of associated tissue necrosis within
   either hyperthermically or cryothermically treated tissues. The
   advantages and limitations of several of these methods will be
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{For more than 50 years, hyperthermia-based cancer researchers have
   utilized mathematical models, cell culture studies and animal models to
   better understand, develop and validate potential new treatments. It has
   been, and remains, unclear how and to what degree these research
   techniques depend on, complement and, ultimately, translate accurately
   to a successful clinical treatment. In the past, when mathematical
   models have not proven accurate in a clinical treatment situation, the
   initiating quantitative scientists (engineers, mathematicians and
   physicists) have tended to believe the biomedical parameters provided to
   them were inaccurately determined or reported. In a similar manner,
   experienced biomedical scientists often tend to question the value of
   mathematical models and cell culture results since those data typically
   lack the level of biologic and medical variability and complexity that
   are essential to accurately study and predict complex diseases and
   subsequent treatments. Such quantitative and biomedical interdependence,
   variability, diversity and promise have never been greater than they are
   within magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia cancer treatment. The use of
   hyperthermia to treat cancer is well studied and has utilized numerous
   delivery techniques, including microwaves, radio frequency, focused
   ultrasound, induction heating, infrared radiation, warmed perfusion
   liquids (combined with chemotherapy), and, recently, metallic
   nanoparticles (NP) activated by near infrared radiation (NIR) and
   alternating magnetic field (AMF) based platforms. The goal of this paper
   is to use proven concepts and current research to address the potential
   pathobiology, modeling and quantification of the effects of treatment as
   pertaining to the similarities and differences in energy delivered by
   known external delivery techniques and iron oxide nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Several clinically successful clinical radio frequency vessel-sealing
   devices are currently available. The dominant thermodynamic principles
   at work involve tissue water vaporization processes. It is necessary to
   thermally denature vessel collagen, elastin and their adherent proteins
   to achieve a successful fusion. Collagens denature at middle
   temperatures, between about 60 and 90 C depending on heating time and
   rate. Elastin, and its adherent proteins, are more thermally robust, and
   require temperatures in excess of the boiling point of water at
   atmospheric pressure to thermally fuse. Rapid boiling at low apposition
   pressures leads to steam vacuole formation, brittle tissue remnants and
   frequently to substantial disruption in the vessel wall, particularly in
   high elastin-content arteries. High apposition pressures substantially
   increase the equilibrium boiling point of tissue water and are necessary
   to ensure a high probability of a successful seal. The FDM numerical
   models illustrate the beneficial effects of high apposition pressures.}},

   measurements. In this work, tissue-mimicking agar phantoms were utilized
   to analyze the accuracy and feasibility of four methods for
   reconstructing the Young's modulus from OCE-measured elastic wave which
   were induced by a focused air-pulse. These reconstruction methods are:
   the shear wave equation (SWE), the surface wave equation (SuWE), the
   Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equation (RLFE), and the finite element method
   (FEM). The reconstructed elasticity values were also compared with
   uniaxial mechanical testing results. It was shown that the RLFE and the
   FEM are more robust in quantifying elasticity than the other simplified
   models. This work may provide a reference for reconstructing the
   biomechanical properties of tissues based on OCE measurements. Accurate
   reconstruction of biomechanical properties is an important issue for
   further developing noninvasive elastography methods.}},

Abstract = {{Carboxylated oligothiophenes were evaluated as interfacial modifiers
   between the organic poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and inorganic TiO2
   layers in bilayer hybrid polymer solar cells. Carboxylated
   oligothiophenes can be isolated using conventional purification
   techniques resulting in pure, monodisperse molecules with 100\%
   carboxylation. Device prototypes using carboxylated oligothiophenes as
   interfacial modifiers showed improved performance in the open-circuit
   voltage and fill factor over devices using unmodified oligothiophenes as
   interfacial modifiers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies
   supported the idea that interface layer adhesion was improved by
   functionalizing oligothiophenes with a carboxyl moiety. Wide-field
   fluorescence images revealed that devices made using carboxylated
   oligothiophenes had fewer aggregates in the P3HT layers atop the
   modified TiO2 surface. Hysteresis seen in the fluorescence intensity as
   a function of applied bias, obtained from In-Device Fluorescence Voltage
   Spectroscopy (ID-FVS), was found to be a diagnostic criterion of the
   quality of the hybrid interface modification. The best interfaces were
   found using oligothiophenes functionalized with carboxylates, which
   created smooth layers on TiO2, and showed no hysteresis, suggesting
   elimination of interfacial charge traps. However, this hysteresis could
   be re-introduced by increasing the scan rate of the applied bias,
   suggesting that smooth P3HT layers created by carboxylated
   oligothiophene interface modifiers were necessary but not sufficient for
   sustaining improved photovoltaic properties especially during long-term
   device operation.}},

Title = {{Negative stiffness honeycombs for recoverable shock isolation}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{193-200}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of negative
   stiffness beams when arranged in a honeycomb configuration and to
   compare the energy absorption capacity of these negative stiffness
   honeycombs with regular honeycombs of equivalent relative densities.
   Design/methodology/approach - A negative stiffness honeycomb is
   fabricated in nylon 11 using selective laser sintering. Its
   force-displacement behavior is simulated with finite element analysis
   and experimentally evaluated under quasi-static displacement loading.
   Similarly, a hexagonal honeycomb of equivalent relative density is also
   fabricated and tested. The energy absorbed for both specimens is
   computed from the resulting force-displacement curves. The beam geometry
   of the negative stiffness honeycomb is optimized for maximum energy
   absorption per unit mass of material.
   Findings - Negative stiffness honeycombs exhibit relatively large
   positive stiffness, followed by a region of plateau stress as the cell
   walls buckle, similar to regular hexagonal honeycombs, but unlike
   regular honeycombs, they demonstrate full recovery after compression.
   Representative specimens are found to absorb about 65 per cent of the
   energy incident on them. Optimizing the negative stiffness beam geometry
   can result in energy-absorbing capacities comparable to regular
   honeycombs of similar relative densities.
   Research limitations/implications - The honeycombs were subject to
   quasi-static displacement loading. To study shock isolation under impact
   loads, force-controlled loading is desirable. However, the energy
   absorption performance of the negative stiffness honeycombs is expected
   to improve under force-controlled conditions. Additional experimentation
   is needed to investigate the rate sensitivity of the force-displacement
   behavior of the negative stiffness honeycombs, and specimens with
   various geometries should be investigated.
   Originality/value - The findings of this study indicate that recoverable
   energy absorption is possible using negative stiffness honeycombs
   without sacrificing the high energy-absorbing capacity of regular
   honeycombs. The honeycombs can find usefulness in a number of unique
   applications requiring recoverable shock isolation, such as bumpers,
   helmets and other personal protection devices. A patent application has
   been filed for the negative stiffness honeycomb design.}},

Title = {{Designing lipids for selective partitioning into liquid ordered membrane

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3241-3250}},
Abstract = {{Self-organization of lipid molecules into specific membrane phases is
   key to the development of hierarchical molecular assemblies that mimic
   cellular structures. While the packing interaction of the lipid tails
   should provide the major driving force to direct lipid partitioning to
   ordered or disordered membrane domains, numerous examples show that the
   headgroup and spacer play important but undefined roles. We report here
   the development of several new biotinylated lipids that examine the role
   of spacer chemistry and structure on membrane phase partitioning. The
   new lipids were prepared with varying lengths of low molecular weight
   polyethylene glycol (EGn) spacers to examine how spacer hydrophilicity
   and length influence their partitioning behavior following binding with
   FITC-labeled streptavidin in liquid ordered (L-o) and liquid disordered
   (L-d) phase coexisting membranes. Partitioning coefficients (K-p
   L-o/L-d) of the biotinylated lipids were determined using fluorescence
   measurements in studies with giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Compared
   against DPPE-biotin, DPPE-cap-biotin, and DSPE-PEG2000-biotin lipids,
   the new dipalmityl-EGn-biotin lipids exhibited markedly enhanced
   partitioning into liquid ordered domains, achieving K-p of up to 7.3
   with a decaethylene glycol spacer (DP-EG10-biotin). We further
   demonstrated biological relevance of the lipids with selective
   partitioning to lipid raft-like domains observed in giant plasma
   membrane vesicles (GPMVs) derived from mammalian cells. Our results
   found that the spacer group not only plays a pivotal role for designing
   lipids with phase selectivity but may also influence the structural
   order of the domain assemblies.}},

Abstract = {{Transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers have attracted extensive
   attention because of their rich physical and chemical properties and
   wide applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the
   electronic properties of tin dichalcogenide monolayers (SnX2, X = S, Se,
   and Te) and the effects of hydrogenation and tension by first-principles
   calculations based on the density-functional theory. We find that a pure
   SnX2 monolayer can be an intrinsic semiconductor or metal depending on
   the Sn-X bonding state. Hydrogenation can transfer its conductivity from
   a narrow-band semiconductor or a metal to wide-band semiconductor. We
   further show that a monolayer with a tunable band gap and even metallic
   characteristics can be achieved by applying tension. We predict that
   these tin-based dichalcogenide monolayers with controllable
   multi-functions may be employed in nanodevices and sensors.}},

Title = {{Finite-Element Studies of Hoop-Stress Enhancement for Wellbore
   Strengthening}},
Journal = {{SPE DRILLING \& COMPLETION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{38-51}},
Abstract = {{In the drilling of deep horizons, the mud-weight window between
   pore-pressure gradient and fracture gradient often narrows because of
   rock properties and underground-stress state. Nonproductive-time events
   such as lost circulation, wellbore instability, kicks, underground
   crossflow, and pipe sticking are more likely. Such problems greatly
   increase drilling costs. Bridging pre-existing natural fractures or
   drilling-induced fractures with lost-circulation materials (LCM) is
   often performed to increase fracture gradient and widen the mud-weight
   window. This technique, referred to as wellbore strengthening, includes
   the stress cage, fracture-closure stress, and
   fracture-propagation-resistance methods. Although these methods are
   often used, several aspects of these approaches are still not thoroughly
   understood.
   To reduce the risk of lost circulation while drilling in formations with
   narrow mud-weight windows, such as pressure-depleted reservoirs and
   deepwater formations, a good understanding of the mechanisms of wellbore
   strengthening in different downhole scenarios helps engineers to
   optimize the design of drilling fluids and operational procedures.
   This paper discusses the mechanism of wellbore strengthening, with a
   focus on hoop stresses at and near the wellbore, in elastic and
   poroelastic models, by use of the finite-element method to evaluate
   wellbore and near-wellbore stresses during fracture creation and
   propagation, and after plugging fractures with LCM. Factors affecting
   fracture behavior, such as horizontal-stress anisotropy, LCM-bridging
   location, initial pore pressure, and fluid leakoff, are investigated. A
   better understanding of the several interacting events local to the
   wellbore and near-wellbore regions can result in improved operational
   practices related to lost-circulation prevention and mitigation.}},

Journal = {{COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{187}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen-based systems, such as fuel cells, are a promising means to
   satisfy portable and remote power demands. Hydrogen transportation and
   storage challenges can be met with point-of-use reforming of hydrocarbon
   fuels to hydrogen-rich syngas. Applications may require geometric
   scaling of system components, including the fuel reformer. This study
   computationally investigates, via a two-dimensional computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) model, the effect of scaling on a noncatalytic
   counter-flow reformer that utilizes heat recirculation to convert
   hydrocarbon fuels to syngas. The dimensions of the counter-flow reactor
   studied previously are used as reference values, and the reactor volume
   is scaled relative to the reference volume by varying either channel
   height or length. Operating range maps are developed that indicate where
   reactor operation is obtained as a function of equivalence ratio and
   inlet velocity. Heat recirculation, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and
   methane conversion efficiencies are quantified over a range of inlet
   velocities and equivalence ratios. Computationally determined peak gas
   and wall temperatures are compared to adiabatic equilibrium
   temperatures. This analysis relates the degree of superadiabicity, the
   extent to which the temperature exceeds that predicted by equilibrium in
   the reactor to the more readily measured wall temperatures, which have
   previously been shown to be important indicators of reactor performance.}},

Abstract = {{The peridynamics theory of solid mechanics has been proposed as a
   suitable framework for material failure and damage simulation. As a
   nonlocal model, based upon integro-differential equations, peridynamics
   is computationally expensive. Concurrent multiscale methods are thus of
   interest for efficient and accurate solutions of peridynamic problems.
   The goal is to restrict the use of peridynamic models to regions where
   discontinuities are present or may be generated, while employing
   classical local models in domains characterized by smooth displacement
   fields. In this article, we derive a blending scheme to concurrently
   couple bond-based peridynamic models and the Navier equation of
   classical elasticity. We extend the work for one-dimensional linear
   peridynamic models presented by Seleson et al. (2013a), to general
   bond-based peridynamic models in higher dimensions, and we provide an
   error estimate for the coupling scheme. We show analytically and
   numerically that the blended model does not exhibit ghost forces and is
   also patch-test consistent. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy
   and efficiency of the blended model proposed, suggesting an alternative
   framework for cases where peridynamic models are too expensive, whereas
   classical local models are not accurate enough.}},

Abstract = {{Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) is popularly in production use for
   one-dimensional-type dense patterns with good pitch control in NAND
   Flash memory applications and the fin layer patterning of FinFET
   devices, but it is still challenging to apply SADP to two-dimensional
   (2-D) random metal patterns. We describe the SADP layout decomposition
   methods for complex 2-D layouts. The SADP for complex logic metals
   consists of a two mask approach using a core (mandrel) mask and a trim
   mask. This paper describes methods for automatically choosing and
   optimizing the manufacturability of base core mask patterns, generating
   assist core patterns, and optimizing trim mask patterns to accomplish
   high quality layout decomposition in the SADP process. Our technique is
   validated with 22-nm node industrial standard cells and logic designs,
   which can be applicable to sub-10-nm node design. Experimental results
   show that our proposed layout decomposition for SADP effectively
   decomposes many challenging 2-D layouts. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{As technology nodes continue to shrink, layout patterns become more
   sensitive to lithography processes, resulting in lithography hotspots

   We propose an accurate hotspot detection approach based on principal
   component analysis-support vector machine classifier. Several
   techniques, including hierarchical data clustering, data balancing, and
   multilevel training, are provided to enhance the performance of the
   proposed approach. Our approach is accurate and more efficient than
   conventional time-consuming lithography simulation and provides a high
   flexibility for adapting to new lithography processes and rules. (C)

Abstract = {{We construct quasi-optimal elimination trees for 2D finite element
   meshes with singularities. These trees minimize the complexity of the
   solution of the discrete system. The computational cost estimates of the
   elimination process model the execution of the multifrontal algorithms
   in serial and in parallel shared-memory executions. Since the meshes
   considered are a subspace of all possible mesh partitions, we call these
   minimizers quasi-optimal. We minimize the cost functionals using dynamic
   programming. Finding these minimizers is more computationally expensive
   than solving the original algebraic system. Nevertheless, from the
   insights provided by the analysis of the dynamic programming minima, we
   propose a heuristic construction of the elimination trees that has cost
   O(N(e)log(N-e)), where N-e is the number of elements in the mesh. We
   show that this heuristic ordering has similar computational cost to the
   quasi-optimal elimination trees found with dynamic programming and
   outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in our numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Planar laser-induced fluorescence of nitric oxide was used to visualize
   the interaction of reaction control system jet flows on the afterbody of
   a hypersonic capsule reentry vehicle at the Calspan-University at
   Buffalo Research Center's Large Energy National Shock Tunnel I reflected
   shock tunnel facility. The interaction of pitch and roll jets with the
   flowfield was investigated. Additionally, thin-film sensors were used to
   monitor heat transfer on the surface of the model to detect localized
   heating resulting from the firing of the reaction control system jets.
   Visualizations of the capsule shear layer using both planar
   laser-induced fluorescence and schlieren imaging compared favorably. The
   structure of the roll jet was found to be significantly altered due to
   interactions with the flowfield. Additionally, the presence of the roll
   jet appeared to change the nature of the shear layer from steady laminar
   to unsteady. The pitch jet structure was only disturbed in the far
   field. Comparison of the planar laser-induced fluorescence jet-fluid
   visualizations and the surface heat flux distributions indicate that the
   regions of enhanced aeroheating are not caused by the jet fluid itself
   impinging on the surface, but rather by the presence of jet-induced
   horseshoe vortices and shock wave/boundary-layer interactions.}},

Title = {{A Coupled Ordinates Method for Convergence Acceleration of the Phonon
   Boltzmann Transport Equation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sequential numerical solution methods are commonly used for solving the
   phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) because of simplicity of
   implementation and low storage requirements. However, they exhibit poor
   convergence for low Knudsen numbers. This is because sequential solution
   procedures couple the phonon BTEs in physical space efficiently but the
   coupling is inefficient in wave vector (K) space. As the Knudsen number
   decreases, coupling in K space becomes dominant and convergence rates
   fall. Since materials like silicon have K-resolved Knudsen numbers that
   span two to five orders of magnitude at room temperature, diffuse-limit
   solutions are not feasible for all K vectors. Consequently, nongray
   solutions of the BTE experience extremely slow convergence. In this
   paper, we develop a coupled-ordinates method for numerically solving the
   phonon BTE in the relaxation time approximation. Here, interequation
   coupling is treated implicitly through a point-coupled direct solution
   of the K-resolved BTEs at each control volume. This implicit solution is
   used as a relaxation sweep in a geometric multigrid method which
   promotes coupling in physical space. The solution procedure is
   benchmarked against a traditional sequential solution procedure for
   thermal transport in silicon. Significant acceleration in computational
   time, between 10 and 300 times, over the sequential procedure is found
   for heat conduction problems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Downburst winds are inherently transient and non-stationary by nature.
   Field records have confirmed the often very rapid variation in time of
   both mean wind speed and wind direction during a downburst. Turbulence
   characteristics in a downburst are also different from those in the
   neutral boundary layer. Studies have indicated that turbulence power
   spectra during a downburst can deviate significantly from more
   traditional spectra used for the neutral boundary layer. Estimated power
   spectra from downburst records indicate additional turbulence energy in
   the mid-frequency range and often they do not follow the -5/3 slope in
   the inertial subrange. In this study, three turbulence models that can
   be combined with a non-turbulent downburst wind field model are
   presented. The influence of these three models on extreme and fatigue
   loads for a 5-MW wind turbine is investigated first. Then, a parametric
   study on the longitudinal turbulence length scale, turbulence intensity,
   and turbulence vertical component in downburst turbulence modeling is
   carried out. The influence of these various turbulence-related
   parameters on loads on the 5-MW wind turbine is discussed. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Electroforming and resistive switching in SiO2 materials are
   investigated by controlling the annealing temperature, etching time and
   operating ambient. Thermal anneal in reducing ambient lowers
   electroforming voltage to <10 V, providing insight into possible
   electroformation precursors. Conductive filaments form within similar to
   4 nm of sidewall surfaces in devices with an etched SiO2 layer, whereas
   most filaments are >10 nm from the electrode edge in devices with
   continuous SiO2 layers. Switching unpassivated devices fails in 1 atm
   air and pure O-2/N-2, with the recovery of vacuum switching at similar
   to 4.6 V after switching attempts in O-2/N-2 and at similar to 9.5 V
   after switching attempts in air. Incorporating a hermetic passivation
   layer enables switching in 1 atm air. Discussions of defect energetics
   and electrochemical reactions lead to a localized switching model
   describing device switching dynamics. Low-frequency noise data are
   consistent with charge transport through electron-trapping defects.
   Low-resistance-state current for <1.5 V bias is modeled by hopping
   conduction. A current ``overshoot{''} phenomenon with threshold near 1.6
   V is modeled as electron tunneling. Results demonstrate that SiO2-based
   resistive memory devices provide a good experimental platform to study
   SiO2 defects. The described electroforming methods and operating models
   may aid development of future SiO2-based resistive memory products.}},

Title = {{Effects of nanoparticles diameter and concentration on natural

Abstract = {{The effects of nanoparticles diameter and concentration on natural
   convection heat transfer of a nanofluid around a vertical cone embedded
   in a Darcy porous medium is theoretically investigated utilizing the
   drift-flux model. The thermal conductivity and the viscosity of the
   nanofluid are assumed as simultaneous functions of temperature and local
   volume fraction of nanoparticles using experimental correlations. In
   addition, the flux of nanoparticles on the surface of the cone is
   assumed to be zero. An efficient mathematical approach with a
   self-similar solution is utilized to theoretically analyze the boundary
   layer heat and mass transfer of an Al2O3-water nanofluid. The reduced
   system of ordinary differential equations are general and can be solved
   for any arbitrary functions of thermal conductivity and viscosity. The
   analysis of the nanofluid natural convection flow is accomplished for
   two cases of (i) T-w > T-infinity and (ii) T-w < T-infinity. The results
   show that using nanoparticles would not (would) enhance the heat
   transfer from the cone for the case of a cone with a hot surface (cold
   surface). A decrease in the size of nanoparticles or an increase in the
   volume fraction of nanoparticles causes a decline in the heat transfer
   rate from the cone when the cone surface is hot. Finally, a comparison
   between the non-homogenous model (drift-flux model) and the homogenous
   model of nanofluids is performed. The results demonstrate that the
   driftflux model tends to the homogeneous model as the size and volume
   fraction of nanoparticles increase. (C) 2014 The Society of Powder

Abstract = {{Diagenetic changes such as cementation or dissolution have a strong
   control on carbonate pore structure, and often disconnect the original
   intergranular pore space. Spatial distribution of submicron porosity
   (microporosity) that develops in the process, as well as its influence
   on flow properties, is difficult to image and characterize. Yet, a
   petrophysically rigorous pore-scale model that accounts for submicron
   porosity interconnectivity would help in the understanding and
   development of carbonate reservoirs dominated by microporosity. We
   present algorithms to geometrically match pore-throat networks from two
   separate length scales that can be extracted directly from
   three-dimensional (3D) rock images, or be constructed to match the
   relevant measured properties. We evaluate the combined influence of
   cementation and dissolution using a Bentheimer Sandstone sample, as well
   as image-identified microporosity on flow transport properties in an
   Estaillades Limestone sample.}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Field observations show that hydraulic fracture growth in naturally
   fractured formations like shale is complex. Preexisting discontinuities
   in shale, including natural fractures and bedding, act as planes of
   weakness that divert fracture propagation. To investigate the influence
   of weak planes on hydraulic fracture propagation, we performed
   Semicircular Bend tests on Marcellus Shale core samples containing
   calcite-filled natural fractures (veins). The approach angle of the
   induced fracture to the veins and the thickness of the veins have a
   strong influence on propagation. As the approach angle becomes more
   oblique to the induced fracture plane, and as the vein gets thicker, the
   induced fracture is more likely to divert into the vein. Microstructural
   analysis of tested samples shows that the induced fracture propagates in
   the middle of the vein but not at the interface between the vein and the
   rock matrix. Cleavage planes and fluid inclusion trails in the vein
   cements exert some control on the fracture path. Combining the
   experimental results with theoretical fracture mechanics arguments, the
   fracture toughness of the calcite veins was estimated to range from
   0.24MPa m(1/2) to 0.83MPa m(1/2), depending on the value used for the
   Young's modulus of the calcite vein material. Measured fracture
   toughness of unfractured Marcellus Shale was 0.47MPa m(1/2).}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and accurate prediction of gas or liquid phase (solute)
   diffusion are essential to accurate prediction of contaminant transport
   in partially saturated porous media. In this study, we propose
   analytical equations, using concepts from percolation theory and the
   Effective Medium Approximation (EMA) to model the saturation dependence
   of both gas and solute diffusion in porous media. The predictions of our
   theoretical approach agree well with the results of nine lattice
   Boltzmann simulations. We find that the universal quadratic scaling
   predicted by percolation theory, combined with the universal linear
   scaling predicted by the EMA, describes diffusion in porous media with
   both relatively broad and extremely narrow pore size distributions.}},

Abstract = {{The products formed by the chemical extraction of lithium from
   LiMn2-xMxO4 (M = Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni) with aqueous sulfuric acid have
   been structurally and chemically characterized. The amount of lithium
   extracted is found to be proportional to the initial Mn3+ content,
   confirming the reaction mechanism, LiMn3+Mn4+O4 -> 0.75 Mn2O4 + 0.5 Li2O
   + 0.5 MnO. Thus, no lithium is extracted from LiMn1.54+Ni0.52+O4 as
   there is no Mn3+, while complete delithiation occurs in LiMn3+Mn4+O4 to
   give Mn2O4. The amount of lithium extracted from the other samples is in
   good agreement with that calculated from the Mn3+ content. The XRD data
   confirm the maintenance of the spinel structure for the delithiated
   samples, while the redox titration confirmed the maintenance of oxygen
   content at 4.0, indicating that no protons were inserted into the
   lattice during delithiation. The findings could provide more insight on
   the problem of metal dissolution from cathode materials in lithium-ion
   batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS. All rights

Title = {{Varying dimensional Bayesian acoustic waveform inversion for 1D
   semi-infinite heterogeneous media}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a methodology to infer the spatial variation of
   the acoustic characteristics of a 1D vertical elastic heterogeneous
   earth model via a Bayesian calibration approach, given a prescribed
   sequence of loading and the corresponding time history response
   registered at the ground level. This involves solving an inverse problem
   that maps the ground seismic response onto a random profile of the
   ground stratigraphy (i.e. a 1D continuous spatial random field). From a
   Bayesian point of view, the solution to an inverse problem is fully
   characterized by a posterior density function of the forward model
   random parameters, which explicitly overcomes the solution's
   non-uniqueness. This subsurface earth model is parameterized using a
   Bayesian partition model, where the number of soil layers, the location
   of the layers' interfaces, and their corresponding mechanical
   characteristics are defined as random variables. The partition model
   approach to an inverse problem is closely related to a Bayesian model
   selection problem, where the likely dimensionality of the inverse
   problem (number of unknowns) is inferred conditioned on the experimental
   observations. The main benefit of the proposed approach is that the
   explicit regularization of the inverted profile by global damping
   procedures is not required. A Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   (RJMCMC) algorithm is used to sample the target posterior of varying
   dimension, dependent on the number of layers. A synthetic case study is
   provided to indicate the applicability of the proposed methodology. (C)

Title = {{Wrinkling and folding of thin films by viscous stress}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1814-1827}},
Abstract = {{We examine the buckling of a thin elastic film floating on a viscous
   liquid layer which is itself supported on a prestretched rubber sheet.
   Releasing the prestretch in the rubber induces a viscous stress in the
   liquid, which in turn induces a compressive stress in the elastic film,
   leading to buckling. Unlike many previous studies on wrinkling of
   floating films, the buckling process in the present study is dominated
   by viscous effects whereas gravitational effects are negligible. An
   approximate shear lag model predicts the evolution of the stress profile
   in the unbuckled film that depends on three parameters: the rate at
   which the prestretch is released, the thickness of the liquid layer, and
   the length of the elastic film. A linear perturbation analysis is
   developed to predict the wavelength of wrinkles. Numerical simulations
   are conducted to predict nonlinear evolution of the wrinkle wavelength
   and amplitude. Experiments using elastic polymer films and viscous
   polymer liquids show trends that are qualitatively consistent with the
   predictions although quantitatively, the experimentally-observed wrinkle
   wavelengths are longer than predicted. Although this article is focused
   only on small-strain wrinkling behavior, we show that application of
   large nominal strains (on the order of 100\%) leads to sharply localized
   folds. Thus this approach may be useful for developing buckled features
   with high aspect ratio on surfaces.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{This paper characterizes the performance of coordinated beamforming with
   dynamic clustering. A downlink model based on stochastic geometry is put
   forth to analyze the performance of such a base station (BS)
   coordination strategy. Analytical expressions for the complementary
   cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the instantaneous
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are derived in terms of relevant
   system parameters, chiefly the number of BSs forming the coordination
   clusters, the number of antennas per BS, and the pathloss exponent.
   Utilizing this CCDF, with pilot overheads further incorporated into the
   analysis, we formulate the optimization of the BS coordination clusters
   for a given fading coherence. Our results indicate that: 1) coordinated
   beamforming is most beneficial to users that are in the outer part of
   their cells yet in the inner part of their coordination cluster and that
   2) the optimal cluster cardinality for the typical user is small and it
   scales with the fading coherence. Simulation results verify the
   exactness of the SIR distributions derived for stochastic geometries,
   which are further compared with the corresponding distributions for
   deterministic grid networks.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-52}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Although adaptive control schemes for spacecraft attitude tracking are
   abundant in controls literature, very few are designed to guarantee
   consistent performance for a spacecraft with both rigid and nonrigid
   (time-varying) inertia components. Because inertia matrix changes are a
   common occurrence due to phenomena like fuel depletion or mass
   displacement in a deployable spacecraft, an adaptive control algorithm
   that takes explicit account of such information is of significant
   interest. In this paper, a novel adaptive attitude control scheme is
   presented for a spacecraft with inertia matrix parameters that have both
   unknown rigid components and only partially determined variable
   components. The proposed controller directly compensates for inertia
   variations that occur as either pure functions of the control input, or
   as functions of time. For the particular case of an input-dependent
   inertia matrix, a bounded control solution is ensured by placing some
   mild restrictions on the initial conditions and by employing a smooth
   projection scheme that confines the parameter estimates to a
   well-dMefined convex set. Detailed derivations of the control law are
   provided, along with a thorough analysis for the associated stability
   and error convergence properties. In addition, numerical simulations are
   presented to highlight the performance benefits when compared with an
   adaptive control scheme that does not account for inertia variations.}},

Abstract = {{Free-standing porous carbon nanofibers with tunable surface area and
   pore structure have been investigated as an interlayer between the
   sulfur cathode and the separator to inhibit the shuttling of the
   intermediate polysulfides in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.
   Specifically, the effects of thickness, surface area, and pore size
   distribution of carbon nanofiber (CNF) interlayers on the performance of
   Li-S batteries have been studied. The carbon nanofiber interlayer not
   only reduces the electrochemical resistance but also localizes the
   migrating polysulfides and traps them, thereby improving the discharge
   capacity as well as cyclability. It was found that the optimum thickness
   of the interlayer is a critical factor to achieve good cell performance,
   in addition to the surface area and pore structure. A high initial
   discharge capacity of 1549 mA h g(-1) at C/5 rate, which is 92\% of the
   theoretical capacity of sulfur, with 98\% average coulombic efficiency
   and 83\% capacity retention after 100 cycles was obtained with a

   determined using the transfer length method is gate-bias dependent and
   ranges from 175 k Omega center dot mu m to 5 k Omega center dot mu m,
   and shows an exponential dependence on back-gate voltage indicating
   Schottky barriers at the source and drain contacts. Dual-gated ReS2 FETs

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the control of the rotation dynamics of
   an innovative type of rotary micromotors with desired performances by
   tuning the magnetic interactions among the assembled micro/nanoscale
   components. The micromotors are made of metallic nanowires as rotors,
   patterned magnetic nanodisks as bearings and actuated by external
   electric fields. The magnetic forces for anchoring the rotors on the
   bearings play an essential role in the rotation dynamics of the
   micromotors. By varying the moment, orientation, and dimension of the
   magnetic components, distinct rotation behaviors can be observed,
   including repeatable wobbling and rolling in addition to rotation. We
   understood the rotation behaviors by analytical modeling, designed and
   realized micromotors with step-motor characteristics. The outcome of
   this research could inspire the development of high-performance
   nanomachines assembled from synthetic nanoentities, relevant to
   nanorobotics, microfluidics, and biomedical research.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in high-resolution time-of-flight chemical
   ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-CIMS) have made it possible to
   directly detect atmospheric organic compounds in real time with high
   sensitivity and with little or no fragmentation, including
   low-volatility, highly oxygenated organic vapors that are precursors to
   secondary organic aerosol formation. Here, using ions identified by
   high-resolution spectra from an HR-ToF-CIMS with acetate reagent ion
   chemistry, we develop an algorithm to estimate the vapor pressures of
   measured organic acids. The algorithm uses identified ion formulas and
   calculated double bond equivalencies, information unavailable in
   quadrupole CIMS technology, as constraints for the number of possible
   oxygen-containing functional groups. The algorithm is tested with
   acetate chemical ionization mass spectrometry (acetate-CIMS) spectra of
   O-3 and OH oxidation products of alpha-pinene and naphthalene formed in
   a flow reactor with integrated OH exposures ranged from 1.2 x 10(11) to
   9.7 x 10(11) molec scm(-3), corresponding to approximately 1.0 to 7.5
   days of equivalent atmospheric oxidation. Measured gas-phase organic
   acids are similar to those previously observed in environmental chamber
   studies. For both precursors, we find that acetate-CIMS spectra capture
   both functionalization (oxygen addition) and fragmentation (carbon loss)
   as a function of OH exposure. The level of fragmentation is observed to
   increase with increased oxidation. The predicted condensed-phase
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) average acid yields and O / C and H / C
   ratios agree within uncertainties with previous chamber and flow reactor
   measurements and ambient CIMS results. While acetate reagent ion
   chemistry is used to selectively measure organic acids, in principle
   this method can be applied to additional reagent ion chemistries
   depending on the application.}},

Abstract = {{A critical element in the application of passive sampling devices for
   estimating in situ the concentrations of contaminants in pore water of
   sediments is predicting the rate of uptake within the device. Herein, we
   demonstrate the relative importance of internal and external mass
   transport processes for sampling devices and show that external
   processes control the kinetics in many instances. As such uptake rates
   are closely related to the surface area to volume ratio of the sampling
   device and site-specific transport conditions. Models based on
   sorption-related molecular diffusion provide an upper bound on
   equilibrium times. The essential model parameters and corresponding
   kinetics at a site with more substantial mixing can be inferred using
   time series of sampler concentrations, concentrations in samplers with
   different geometry, or concentrations of performance reference
   compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{773-790}},
Abstract = {{Recent findings indicate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is best
   predicted by asleep systolic blood pressure (SBP), and lowering it by
   scheduling >= 1 conventional long-acting hypertension medications, alone
   or in combination, at bedtime significantly lessens vascular-associated
   risks. Some 20 years ago, four controlled-onset extended-release
   drug-delivery systems incorporating a calcium channel or beta-blocker,
   with the treatment goal specifically being attenuation of morning rather
   than asleep BP, were conceived as one type of bedtime hypertension
   chronotherapy. However, the CONVINCE outcomes trial failed to
   substantiate the merit of targeting morning and daytime BP to decrease
   CVD risk. The HOPE trial, entailing bedtime ramipril treatment for high
   CVD risk patients, showed substantial reduction of vascular-related
   events, theorized as the beneficial treatment-time-dependent strong
   asleep BP lowering. The MAPEC trial was the first prospective randomized
   treatment-time outcomes investigation to test the worthiness of bedtime
   hypertension chronotherapy entailing >= 1 conventional long-acting
   medications (BTCT), in comparison to the conventional morning-time
   therapeutic scheme for all medications (CMTT), to normalize asleep BP
   and diminish CVD risk. BTCT compared to CMTT significantly better
   lowered asleep BP and most importantly major CVD-associated morbidity
   and mortality, including myocardial infarction and ischemic and
   hemorrhagic stroke, by similar to 60\%. CVD risk reduction was strongest
   when the BTCT included an angiotensin receptor blocker. The HOPE and
   MAPEC trials provide positive evidence of very significant CVD risk
   reduction by a BTCT strategy that specifically targets normalization of
   asleep BP, evidence that awaits conformation by the ongoing Hygia and
   other outcomes trials.}},

Abstract = {{In computer-aided manufacturing process planning, the determination of
   fixtures is often completed after a process plan is generated. This
   strategy does not consider the manufacturing dependency between the
   process planning and the fixture design, which in fact needs to be
   thoroughly assessed before any conclusion regarding the optimality of a
   plan or the quality of a proposed fixture can be made. In this paper, a
   concurrent approach is presented in which the fixture design and machine
   planning are combined in an automated search process that starts with
   simply a CAD model. First, a rule-based algorithm is used to define all
   feasible manufacturing operations for the given CAD model. Then, a
   hierarchical search technique is developed to discern which operations
   are best in terms of manufacturing time, cost, and fixture quality. The
   fixture quality is a quantitative measure derived based on a collection
   of fixture design guidelines from manufacturing experiences and
   engineering handbooks and is intended to give a consistent and complete
   assessment of a fixture design. Cases studies and discussion are
   provided to showcase distinct characteristics of our algorithm. A real
   implementation of one suggested plan is also presented in order to
   validate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{High-density, high-rate FeSb-TiC-C nanocomposite alloy anodes composed
   of varying amounts of FeSb, TiC, and conductive carbon black have been
   synthesized by heating the metallic precursors first followed by
   high-energy mechanical milling (HEMM) of the product with carbon black.
   The synthesis method allows for a systematic variation of the TiC and
   carbon contents within the electrode so that the effects of each
   component on the electrochemical performance can be understood. The
   FeSb-TiC-C samples display high tap density (2.9 g cm(-3)), high
   reversible specific capacity (450 mA h g(-1)), superior volumetric
   capacity (1300 mA h cm(-3)), and high rate capability (89\% retention of
   the C/5 capacity at 10 C rate). However, realizing a cycle life of >500
   cycles requires increased contents of carbon and TiC, which lead to a
   reduction in reversible capacity and tap density. Incorporation of
   additives, such as fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) or vinylene carbonate
   (VC), into the electrolyte provides moderate improvements in cycle life.
   The FeSb-TiC-C nanocomposite anodes with a high volumetric capacity at a
   moderate operating voltage offer an attractive alternative to graphite
   anodes with safety advantages.}},

Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-13}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the bulk energy
   transport processes in the build chamber environment before and during
   laser sintering (LS) to provide a basis for effective and accurate
   thermal control for the LS process. This leads to improved mechanical
   properties and geometrical tolerances for LS products and may be applied
   to optimize operation cycle times for the LS process.
   Design/methodology/approach - Computational models with two levels of
   complexity were built to explore the heat transfer mechanisms in the LS
   process. In a one-dimensional model (1D), the powder performed as a
   semi-infinite solid and heater flux to the powder surface was modeled
   with a heater control law. A two-dimensional (2D) fluid/solid finite
   element model of the build chamber and powder bins provided insight into
   the thermal processes in the build chamber.
   Findings - Numerical 1D simulations were verified with measurements from
   sensors embedded in the build chamber powder bed. Using a 2D model,
   computed powder surface temperatures during the warm up and build phases
   were verified with an infrared camera. Convective currents in the build
   chamber and non-uniformities in the distribution of temperature over the
   radiant heater surface were found to be substantial contributors to
   non-uniformities in the powder bed surface temperature.
   Research limitations/implications - Limited heat sources were analyzed.
   No three-dimensional model was built. Assumptions to decrease the part
   bed temperature difference were not tested.
   Originality/value - These simulation and experimental results may be
   used to enhance thermal control and operation efficiency during the LS
   process and to improve LS product mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a random network model for a device-to-device (D2D)
   underlaid cellular system using stochastic geometry and develops
   centralized and distributed power control algorithms. The goal of
   centralized power control is twofold: ensure that the cellular users
   have sufficient coverage probability by limiting the interference
   created by underlaid D2D users, while scheduling as many D2D links as
   possible. For the distributed power control method, the optimal on-off
   power control strategy is proposed, which maximizes the sum rate of the
   D2D links. Expressions are derived for the coverage probabilities of
   cellular, D2D links, and the sum rate of the D2D links in terms of the
   density of D2D links and the path-loss exponent. The analysis reveals
   the impact of key system parameters on the network performance. For
   example, the bottleneck of D2D underlaid cellular networks is the
   cross-tier interference between D2D links and the cellular user, not the
   D2D intratier interference when the density of D2D links is sparse.
   Simulation results verify the exactness of the derived coverage
   probabilities and the sum rate of D2D links.}},

Title = {{Desorption-induced shear failure of coal bed seams during gas depletion}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{142-151}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The recovery of natural gas from coal bed seams is usually accompanied
   by a significant increase of permeability induced by coal matrix
   shrinkage and stress relaxation upon gas desorption. This advantageous
   increase in permeability may be impaired sometimes by mechanical failure
   of the reservoir rock and ensuing production of coal fines.
   Near-wellbore stress concentration and reduction of lateral stresses are
   known to promote shear failure during depletion in oil and gas reservoir
   formations. Yet, conventional analyses have shown limited success in
   predicting coal failure, since other chemo-physical mechanisms may be
   responsible in enhancing the conditions towards mechanical failure in
   the coal bed reservoir rock. We show a set of triaxial experiments
   involving gas desorption from coal cores under zero-lateral strain
   condition (radial stress measured and controlled) and constant total
   vertical stress meant to simulate the stress path during production far
   from the wellbore. CO2 is used as surrogate fluid for CH4. The
   experimental data indicates that desorption can significantly help
   reduce lateral stress (and increasing deviatoric stress) until shear
   failure occurs. The results suggest that depletion-induced shear failure
   is much more likely to occur in coal seams than in conventional
   non-sorbing reservoir rocks. The adsorptive-mechanical coupling turns
   out to be a key phenomenon in the process. Numerical simulations at the
   representative elementary volume scale adopting a double-porosity
   poromechanical model support the experimental findings and permit
   calculating a critical gas pressure for shear failure to happen. This
   emergent phenomenon is comparable to the outcome of other situations
   such as mineral dissolution or thermal contraction, where shrinkage
   relaxes lateral stress and acts as an intensifying driver for promoting
   shear failure within the reservoir rock. Coupled numerical simulation is
   needed to include near-wellbore effects and validate our findings with
   actual field observations. A thorough understanding of the coupled
   response of coal seams is necessary to enhance reservoir management and
   mitigate the effects of coal failure on fines production. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Jilin oilfield is conducting the first large scale demonstration project
   on CO2 EOR and storage in the northeast China. CO2 with high purity is
   produced from a nearby natural gas reservoir and injected into the tight
   oil reservoir of H-59 block. Up to early in 2012, more than 20 x 10(4)
   tons of CO2 has been injected into the reservoir through a miscible
   flooding scheme. In order to track the migration of CO2 in the reservoir
   and ensure a long-term storage safety, a monitoring program has been
   deployed in the field. The used monitoring techniques include wellbore
   integrity detecting, produced fluid sampling, CO2 gas tracer, electric
   spontaneous potential measurement, micro-seismic and cross-well seismic.
   An environmental monitoring program is also implemented for verifying
   CO2 leakage. Preliminary results indicate that it is effective to detect
   the movement of CO2 in the oil reservoir by jointly applying various
   monitoring techniques based on wellbores. After more than four years of
   operation since 2008, nearly 80\% of injected CO2 has been stored in the
   reservoir with the rest of injected CO2 breakthrough in the production
   wells. CO2 storage safety needs more detailed and comprehensive
   monitoring data for further verification. The obtained preliminary
   monitoring experience can provide valuable guidance for the future
   enlarged Jilin project and other CO2 EOR and storage operations. (C)

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{136-145}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Oil recovery from fractured carbonate reservoirs by water flooding is
   often inefficient due to the commonly oil-wet nature of these rocks and
   the lack of sufficient spontaneous capillary imbibition driving force to
   push oil out from the matrix to the fracture network. Chemical processes
   such as surfactant/alkali-induced wettability alteration and interfacial
   tension (IFT) reduction have shown great potential to reduce the
   residual oil saturation in matrix blocks, leading to significant
   incremental oil recovery (IOR). However, the time required to achieve a
   significant amount of oil recovery is the most crucial deciding factor
   in field projects. The magnitude of recovery and response time of any
   chemical process depends on the degree of wettability alteration and LH
   reduction, the nature and density of fracture network, and the matrix
   block size.
   Oil recovery experiments were performed for the same matrix rock and
   chemical formulation, but for different sized cores to gain a better
   understanding of the time dependence of the recovery process. The
   measured oil recoveries were history-matched. The simulation models were
   then used to predict the recovery response times for larger cores. The
   controlled and systematic laboratory measurements for several core sizes
   helped in developing dimensionless scaling groups to aid in
   understanding the time dependence and the upscaling of laboratory
   results to field-scale applications.
   This finding is significant as it illustrates the extent of wettability
   alteration. and IFT reduction needed in fractured reservoirs. Laboratory
   measurements and simulation work substantiate the validity and the range
   of applicability of upscaled procedures and indicate the importance of
   viscous and buoyancy forces in larger field cases. The results of this
   work will be useful for the design of future field projects. (C) 2014

Title = {{The effect of subgrid-scale models on the entrainment of a passive
   scalar in a turbulent planar jet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{342-366}},
Abstract = {{Classical large-eddy simulation (LES) modelling assumes that the passive
   subgrid-scale (SGS) models do not influence large-scale quantities, even
   though there is now ample evidence of this in many flows. In this work,
   direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulations of
   turbulent planar jets at Reynolds number Re-H = 6000 including a passive
   scalar with Schmidt number Sc = 0.7 are used to study the effect of
   several SGS models on the flow integral quantities e.g. velocity and
   scalar jet spreading rates. The models analysed are theSmagorinsky,
   dynamic Smagorinsky, shear-improved Smagorinsky and the Vreman. Detailed
   analysis of the thin layer bounding the turbulent and non-turbulent
   regions - the so-called turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI) - shows
   that this region raises new challenges for classical SGS models. The
   small scales are far from equilibrium and contain a high fraction of the
   total kinetic energy and scalar variance, but the situation is worse for
   the scalar than for the velocity field. Both a-priori and a-posteriori
   (LES) tests show that the dynamic Smagorinsky and shear-improved models
   give the best results because they are able to accurately capture the
   correct statistics of the velocity and passive scalar fluctuations near
   the TNTI. The results also suggest the existence of a critical
   resolution (x), of the order of the Taylor scale , which is needed for
   the scalar field. Coarser passive scalar LES i.e. (x) results in
   dramatic changes in the integral quantities. This fact is explained by
   the dynamics of the small scales near the jet interface.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the band gap by tuning the lattice structure through
   pressure engineering is a relatively new route for tailoring the
   optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we
   investigate the electronic structure and lattice vibrational dynamics of
   the distorted monolayer 1T-MoS2 (1T') and the monolayer 2H-MoS2 via a
   diamond anvil cell (DAC) and density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations. The direct optical band gap of the monolayer 2H-MoS2
   increases by 11.7\% from 1.85 to 2.08 eV, which is the highest reported
   for a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) material. DFT
   calculations reveal a subsequent decrease in the band gap with eventual
   metallization of the monolayer 2H-MoS2, an overall complex
   structureproperty relation due to the rich band structure of MoS2.
   Remarkably, the metastable 1T'-MoS2 metallic state remains invariant
   with pressure, with the J(2), A(1g), and E(2)g modes becoming dominant
   at high pressures. This substantial reversible tunability of the
   electronic and vibrational properties of the MoS2 family can be extended
   to other 2D TMDs. These results present an important advance toward
   controlling the band structure and optoelectronic properties of
   monolayer MoS2 via pressure, which has vital implications for enhanced
   device applications.}},

Title = {{Control of selectivity in allylic alcohol oxidation on gold surfaces:
   the role of oxygen adatoms and hydroxyl species}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{4730-4738}},
Abstract = {{Gold catalysts display high activity and good selectivity for partial
   oxidation of a number of alcohol species. In this work, we discuss the
   effects of oxygen adatoms and surface hydroxyls on the selectivity for
   oxidation of allylic alcohols (allyl alcohol and crotyl alcohol) on gold
   surfaces. Utilizing temperature programmed desorption (TPD), reactive
   molecular beam scattering (RMBS), and density functional theory (DFT)
   techniques, we provide evidence to suggest that the selectivity
   displayed towards partial oxidation versus combustion pathways is
   dependent on the type of oxidant species present on the gold surface.
   TPD and RMBS results suggest that surface hydroxyls promote partial
   oxidation of allylic alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes with very
   high selectivity, while oxygen adatoms promote both partial oxidation
   and combustion pathways. DFT calculations indicate that oxygen adatoms
   can react with acrolein to promote the formation of a bidentate surface
   intermediate, similar to structures that have been shown to decompose to
   generate combustion products over other transition metal surfaces.
   Surface hydroxyls do not readily promote such a process. Our results
   help explain phenomena observed in previous studies and may prove useful
   in the design of future catalysts for partial oxidation of alcohols.}},

Journal = {{Nature Communications}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sensing an incoming signal is typically associated with absorbing a
   portion of its energy, inherently perturbing the measurement and
   creating reflections and shadows. Here, in contrast, we demonstrate a
   non-invasive, shadow-free, invisible sensor for airborne sound waves at
   audible frequencies, which fully absorbs the impinging signal, without
   at the same time perturbing its own measurement or creating a shadow.
   This unique sensing device is based on the unusual scattering properties
   of a parity-time (PT) symmetric metamaterial device formed by a pair of
   electro-acoustic resonators loaded with suitably tailored non-Foster
   electrical circuits, constituting the acoustic equivalent of a coherent
   perfect absorber coupled to a coherent laser. Beyond the specific
   application to non-invasive sensing, our work broadly demonstrates the
   unique relevance of PT-symmetric metamaterials for acoustics, loss
   compensation and extraordinary wave manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput immune repertoire sequencing has emerged as a critical
   step in the understanding of adaptive responses following infection or

   antibody variable heavy-light pairs (VH-VL pairs) remains a major
   challenge, and no technologies exist to adequately interrogate the >1 x

   sequester single B cells into emulsion droplets containing lysis buffer
   and magnetic beads for mRNA capture; subsequent emulsion RT-PCR
   generated VH-VL amplicons for next-generation sequencing. Massive VH-VL
   repertoire analyses of three human donors provided new immunological
   insights including (i) the identity, frequency and pairing propensity of
   shared, or `public', VL genes, (ii) the detection of allelic inclusion

Abstract = {{Auto-ignition of sprays plays a key role in diesel engines,
   high-altitude relight of aircraft engines, and augmenters. The ignition
   process occurs exclusively at the small scales and represents the
   interaction of evaporation, turbulent mixing, and combustion. Here, a
   large eddy simulation (LES) methodology combined with a probability
   density function (PDF) approach is used to simulate a series of methanol
   spray flames. To account for the small-scale interaction between spray
   droplets and the gas-phase combustion process, a stochastic model is
   proposed. Detailed chemical kinetics is used along with in situ adaptive
   tabulation (ISAT) to accelerate the computations. The simulations
   produce very good agreement with experimental data. From the LES
   computations, it is postulated that the ignition process happens through
   two different mechanisms: an entrainment process that traps droplets in
   high-temperature oxidizer pockets, and a stratified premixed process. It
   is shown that without the explicit model for the spray/combustion
   coupling, a more premixed propagation is observed due to the artificial
   mixing induced by the algorithm. Finally, it is shown that increased
   subfilter mixing leads to a reduction in peak temperatures, where
   ignition kernels are dissipated quickly. (C) 2014 The Combustion

Title = {{Direct numerical simulation of supersonic combustion with thermal

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{2145-2153}},
Abstract = {{Flow inside the combustor of a scramjet engine is likely to be in
   thermal nonequilibrium due to upstream shock-based compression. Given
   the short flow-through timescales in such engines, the flow will not
   reach equilibrium in the combustor. Since the distribution of energy in
   the internal modes affects chemical reactions, nonequilibrium could have
   significant impact on ignition and flame stabilization inside scramjet
   combustors. In this study, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is used to
   understand the impact of thermal nonequilibrium on flame structure in a
   supersonic flow. The operating conditions correspond to the HyShot II
   scramjet experiment. A two-temperature model along with detailed
   chemical kinetics is used to model supersonic combustion. It is observed
   that when vibrational temperature is lower than translational
   temperature, there is significant delay in flame ignition. In addition,
   combustion reactions are weaker leading to reduced heat release. The
   vibrational temperature exhibits a broad dissipation structure compared
   to a conserved scalar, but contains thin dissipation elements near the
   shear layer between the fuel and oxidizer. There is a small improvement
   in turbulent mixing with nonequilibrium, primarily due to reduced
   viscosity arising from lower translational temperature in the domain.
   Overall, thermal equilibrium occurs over time scales longer than the
   integral scale, indicating that nonequilibrium will play a crucial role
   in the internal structure of the flame. (C) 2014 The Combustion

Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{208-218}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Widespread adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) may
   substantially reduce emissions of greenhouse gases while improving
   regional air quality and increasing energy security. However, outcomes
   depend heavily on the electricity generation process, power plant
   locations, and vehicle use decisions. This paper provides a clear
   methodology for predicting PEV emissions impacts by anticipating
   battery-charging decisions and power plant energy sources across Texas.
   Life-cycle impacts of vehicle production and use and Texans' exposure to
   emissions are also computed and monetized. This study reveals to what
   extent PEVs are more environmentally friendly, for most pollutant
   species, than conventional passenger cars in Texas, after recognizing
   the emissions and energy impacts of battery provision and other
   manufacturing processes. Results indicate that PEVs on today's grid can
   reduce GHGs, NOx, PM10, and CO in urban areas, but generate
   significantly higher emissions of SO2 than existing light-duty vehicles.
   Use of coal for electricity production is a primary concern for PEV
   growth, but the energy security benefits of electrified vehicle-miles
   endure. As conventional vehicle emissions rates improve, it appears that
   power grids must follow suit (by improving emissions technologies and/or
   shifting toward cleaner generation sources) to compete on an
   emissions-monetized basis with conventional vehicles in many locations.
   Moreover, while PEV pollution impacts may shift to more remote (power
   plant) locations, dense urban populations remain most strongly affected
   by local power plant emissions in many Texas locations. (C) 2014

Title = {{Combining a dynamic battery model with high-resolution smart grid data
   to assess microgrid islanding lifetime}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{482-489}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we use experimental data collected from an Austin, Texas
   smart grid test bed with a system-level battery energy storage model to
   assess the lifetime of batteries in a microgrid operating in islanded
   mode during a distribution-level outage. We consider a hypothetical
   microgrid consisting of 21 single-family detached homes and three
   transformer-level community energy storage (CES) battery units ranging
   in size from 25 kW h to 75 kW h. To describe the performance of CES
   batteries, we implement a dynamic behavioral circuit model capable of
   describing voltage transients and rate-capacity effects. We use
   one-minute electricity production and consumption data collected from
   the smart grid test bed in 2012 to assess how the timing of an electric
   outage affects the islanding lifetime of a residential microgrid. We
   contrast our results with the average outage duration reported by U.S.
   electric utilities to quantify how often a residential microgrid could
   withstand a typical outage. Our results show that increasing the amount
   of rooftop PV in a residential microgrid does not significantly increase
   how often it can withstand an average-duration outage. However,
   combining PV with CES extends the median islanding lifetime by up to
   11.6 h during morning outages. Based on our results, 50 kW h CES
   provides the best tradeoff between the cost of a CES system and its
   reliability benefit, allowing downstream loads to withstand an
   average-duration outage approximately 93\% of the time. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Elemental compositions of organic aerosol (OA) particles provide useful
   constraints on OA sources, chemical evolution, and effects. The Aerodyne
   high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) is
   widely used to measure OA elemental composition. This study evaluates
   AMS measurements of atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O : C), hydrogen-to-carbon
   (H : C), and organic mass-to-organic carbon (OM : OC) ratios, and of
   carbon oxidation state ((OS) over bar (C))for a vastly expanded
   laboratory data set of multifunctional oxidized OA standards. For the
   expanded standard data set, the method introduced by Aiken et al.
   (2008), which uses experimentally measured ion intensities at all ions
   to determine elemental ratios (referred to here as
   ``Aiken-Explicit{''}), reproduces known O: C and H: C ratio values
   within 20\% (average absolute value of relative errors) and 12\%,
   respectively. The more commonly used method, which uses empirically
   estimated H2O+ and CO+ ion intensities to avoid gas phase air
   interferences at these ions (referred to here as ``Aiken-Ambient{''}),
   reproduces O: C and H: C of multifunctional oxidized species within 28
   and 14\% of known values. The values from the latter method are
   systematically biased low, however, with larger biases observed for
   alcohols and simple diacids. A detailed examination of the H2O+, CO+,
   and CO2+ fragments in the high-resolution mass spectra of the standard
   compounds indicates that the Aiken-Ambient method underestimates the CO
   C and especially H2O+ produced from many oxidized species. Combined
   AMS-vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) ionization measurements indicate that these
   ions are produced by dehydration and decarboxylation on the AMS
   vaporizer (usually operated at 600 degrees C). Thermal decomposition is
   observed to be efficient at vaporizer temperatures down to 200 degrees
   C. These results are used together to develop an ``Improved-Ambient{''}
   elemental analysis method for AMS spectra measured in air. The
   Improved-Ambient method uses specific ion fragments as markers to
   correct for molecular functionality-dependent systematic biases and
   reproduces known O : C (H : C) ratios of individual oxidized standards
   within 28\% (13 \%) of the known molecular values. The error in
   Improved-Ambient O : C (H : C) values is smaller for theoretical
   standard mixtures of the oxidized organic standards, which are more
   representative of the complex mix of species present in ambient OA. For
   ambient OA, the Improved-Ambient method produces O : C (H : C) values
   that are 27\% (11 \%) larger than previously published Aiken-Ambient
   values; a corresponding increase of 9\% is observed for OM : OC values.
   These results imply that ambient OA has a higher relative oxygen content
   than previously estimated. The (OS) over bar (C) values calculated for
   ambient OA by the two methods agree well, however (average relative
   difference of 0.06 (OS) over bar (C) units). This indicates that (OS)
   over bar (C) is a more robust metric of oxidation than O : C, likely
   since (OS) over bar (C) is not affected by hydration or dehydration,
   either in the atmosphere or during analysis.}},

Abstract = {{RNAs are more susceptible to modifications than DNA, and chemical
   modifications in RNA have an effect on their structure and function.
   This study aimed to characterize chemical effects on total RNA in human
   A549 lung cells after exposure to elevated levels of major secondary air
   pollutants commonly found in urban locations, including ozone (O-3),
   acrolein (ACR) and methacrolein (MACR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assays (ELISA) were used to measure levels of interleukin (IL)-8 in the
   growth media and 8-oxoguanine (8OG) levels in total cellular RNA, and
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the growth media was measured by a
   coupled enzymatic assay. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure levels of microRNA 10b (miR-10b).
   The study found that 1-h exposure to all tested pollutant mixtures
   consistently caused significant increases in the levels of 8OG in total
   RNA. In the case of 4 ppm O-3 exposures, measured levels of IL-8, LDH
   and miR-10b each showed consistent trends between two independent
   trials, but varied among these three targets. After 1-h exposures to an
   ACR+MACR mixture, measured levels of IL-8, LDH and miR-10b showed
   variable results. For mixtures of O-3+ACR+MACR, IL-8 measurements showed
   no change; miR-10b and LDH showed variable results. The results indicate
   that short-term high-concentration exposures to air pollution can cause
   RNA chemical modifications. Chemical modifications in RNAs could
   represent more consistent markers of cellular stress relative to other
   inflammation markers, such as IL-8 and LDH, and provide a new biomarker
   endpoint for mechanistic studies in toxicity of air pollution exposure.}},

Title = {{Effect of Ru substitution on the first charge-discharge cycle of
   lithium-rich layered oxides}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2006-2011}},
Abstract = {{The electrochemical properties of lithium-rich layered oxides are
   affected significantly by the first-cycle charge-discharge
   characteristics. Specifically, the lengths of the sloping and plateau
   regions of the first charge influence the charge capacity, irreversible
   capacity loss in the first cycle, reversible capacity, cyclability, and
   voltage decay. We present here an analysis and understanding of the
   first charge-discharge profiles by substituting Ru4+ for Mn4+ in
   Li1.2Mn0.6-xRuxNi0.2O2 (0 <= x <= 0.60). While most of the X-ray
   diffraction peaks at low Ru contents could be indexed on the basis of
   the trigonal R (3) over bar m structure, those for x >= 0.4 could be
   indexed on the basis of the monoclinic P12/m structure of Li2RuO3.
   Rietveld refinement data provides preliminary evidence of Ru-Ru dimer
   formation in these samples. The Ru substitution increases the sloping
   region, but decreases the plateau region corresponding to the loss of
   oxygen from the lattice. The shorter plateau region decreases the charge
   capacity and irreversible capacity loss. The dQ/dV plots and
   open-circuit voltage measurements indicate a decrease in cell voltage
   with increasing Ru substitution, largely due to the shifts in the
   positions of the Ru4+/(5+):4d and O2-:2p bands. Ru-Ru dimerization that
   splits the Ru4+:t(2g) band into bonding/antibonding orbitals could
   explain the decrease in voltage and shortening of the oxygen-loss
   plateau due to a decreased overlap between the Ru4+/5+:4d and O2-:2p
   bands.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2399-2406}},
Abstract = {{Micro-sized carbon-coated Si-based composites have been developed by a
   simple mechanochemical reaction between SiO, Ni, and Al, followed by an
   additional milling process with graphite. The resultant carbon-coated
   Si-based composite exhibits a reversible capacity of over 580 mA h g(-1)
   after 200 cycles with a considerably higher tap density of similar to
   1.34 g cm(-3) compared to nanosized Si (similar to 0.16 g cm(-3)). The
   improvement in the electrochemical performance is achieved due to both
   highly conductive NiSi2 nanoinclusions and amorphous Al2O3 buffer matrix
   in the composite. Upon cycling, the multifunctional NiSi2 phase not only
   provides enhanced electronic conductivity but also suppresses the
   formation of crystalline Li15Si4 that causes an inhomogeneous volume
   change. Simultaneously, amorphous Al2O3 plays a crucial role in
   maintaining particle connectivity by impeding the agglomeration of
   active Si nanocrystallites. The combination of these advantages with a
   low-cost, scalable, and environmentally benign synthetic process make
   the Si-based composite a promising alternative anode for high

Title = {{Comparison of three Stark problem solution techniques for the bounded
   case}},
Journal = {{CELESTIAL MECHANICS \& DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-60}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Three methods of obtaining solutions to the Stark problem-one developed
   by Lantoine and Russell using Jacobi elliptic and related functions, one
   developed by Biscani and Izzo using Weierstrass elliptic and related
   functions, and one developed by Pellegrini, Russell, and Vittaldev using
   and Taylor series extended to the Stark problem-are compared
   qualitatively and quantitatively for the bounded motion case. For
   consistency with existing available code for the series solution,
   Fortran routines of the Lantoine method and Biscani method are newly
   implemented and made available. For these implementations, the Lantoine
   formulation is found to be more efficient than the Biscani formulation
   in the propagation of a single trajectory segment. However, for
   applications for which acceptable accuracy may be achieved by orders up
   to 16, the Pellegrini series solution is shown to be more efficient than
   either analytical method. The three methods are also compared in the
   propagation of sequentially connected trajectory segments in a
   low-thrust orbital transfer maneuver. Separate tests are conducted for
   discretizations between 8 and 96 segments per orbit. For the series
   solution, the interaction between order and step size leads to
   computation times that are nearly invariable to discretization for a
   given truncation error tolerance over the tested range of
   discretizations. This finding makes the series solution particularly
   attractive for mission design applications where problems may require
   both coarse and fine discretizations. Example applications include the
   modeling of low-thrust propulsion and time-varying
   perturbations-problems for which the efficient propagation of relatively
   short Stark segments is paramount because the disturbing acceleration
   generally varies continuously.}},

   objective of this study was to investigate the impact of vegetative
   cells of Sporosarcina pasteurii on the hydration kinetics and
   compressive strength of cement-based materials. The hydration kinetics
   were greatly influenced when a bacterial solution consisting of
   urea-yeast extract nutrient medium and vegetative cells was used to
   prepare bacterial cement pastes; specifically, severe retardation was
   observed. In addition, an increase in calcium carbonate precipitation,
   particularly calcite, occurred within the bacterial pastes. Furthermore,
   after the first day of hydration, the bacterial mortar displayed
   compressive strength that was similar to or greater than the compressive
   strength of the neat mortar. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Using BEopt (EnergyPlus) with energy audits and surveys to predict
   actual residential energy usage}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{808-816}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Simulations of building energy use can give insights into how energy
   efficiency retrofits and operational changes can influence a building's
   total and temporal energy use. However, before those models are used to
   generate recommendations, it is important to understand how accurately
   the simulations predict actual energy use. This paper seeks to determine
   model accuracy by considering 54 homes in Austin, TX that are part of a
   smart grid demonstration project. Data about the homes were collected
   with energy audits then converted into energy models using BEopt
   (version 2.0), a residential building-focused graphical user interface
   (GUI) front-end for EnergyPlus developed by NREL Actual meter reads (kW
   h) were compared to simulation results for four cases: (I) energy model
   output with typical meteorological year (TMY) weather data, (2) output
   with an actual meteorological year weather (AMY) file created using real
   weather data from a year during which actual energy use measurements
   were made, (3) model output with thermostat user behavior data, and (4)
   output using a simplified home geometry. The purpose of this analysis
   was to evaluate how well this model, as it is, could be expected to
   predict energy usage using varying levels of inputs that might be
   included on an energy audit and survey. Results indicate that the
   modeling software was able to estimate aggregate annual electrical
   energy usage within 1\% (for groups of homes) but might vary up to 28\%
   (absolute) for an individual home. Using AMY weather data (Case 2)
   yielded results within 2.4\% of measured (aggregate) energy use, while
   using a TMY3 weather file for Austin yielded results within 9\% of
   (aggregate) actual usage. Using a simplified home geometry did not
   appreciably change the results of the model or its ability to simulate
   real usage. Results show that while the model does a reasonable job
   predicting usage for homes with average usage, the model has trouble
   predicting usage of homes with low or high consumption, particularly
   homes below 5 kW h/ft(2)/year (0.47 kW h/m(2)/year) of average energy
   use or above 10 kW h/ft(2)/year (0.93 kW h/m(2)/year), likely due to
   unknowns about the home when BEopt defaults were used. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Los Azufres geothermal complex of central Mexico is characterized by
   fumaroles and boiling hot-springs. The fumaroles form habitats for
   extremophilic mosses and ferns. Physico-chemical measurements of two
   relatively pristine fumarolic microcosms point to their resemblance with
   the paleo-environment of earth during the Ordovician and Devonian
   periods. These geothermal habitats were analysed for the distribution of
   elemental mass fractions in the rhizospheric soil (RS), the native
   volcanic substrate (VS) and the sediments (S), using the new
   high-sensitivity technique of polarized x-ray energy dispersive
   fluorescence spectrometry (PEDXRF) as well as instrumental neutron
   activation analysis (INAA) for selected elements. This work presents the
   results for the naturally occurring heavy radioactive elements (NOHRE)
   Bi, Th and U but principally the latter two. For the RS, the density was
   found to be the least and the total organic matter content the most. Bi
   was found to be negligibly present in all substrate types. The average
   Th and U mass fractions in the RS were higher than in the VS and about
   equal to their average mass fractions in the S. The VS mass fraction of
   Th was higher, and of U lower, than the mass fractions in the earth's
   crust. In fact for the fumaroles of one site, the average RS mass
   fractions of these elements were higher than the averaged values for S
   (without considering the statistical dispersion). The immobilization of
   the NOHRE in the RS is brought about by the bio-geochemical processes
   specific to these extremophiles. Its effectiveness is such that despite
   the small masses of these plants, it compares with, or may sometimes
   exceed, the immobilization of the NOHRE in the S by the abiotic and
   aggressive chemical action of the hot-springs. These results indicate
   that the fumarolic plants are able to transform the volcanic substrate
   to soil and to affect the NOHRE mass fractions even though these
   elements are not plant nutrients. Mirrored back to the paleo times when
   such plant types were ubiquitous, it would mean that the first plants
   contributed significantly to pedogenesis and the biogeochemical
   recycling of even the heaviest and radioactive elements. Such plants may
   potentially be useful for the phytostabilisation of soil moderately
   contaminated by the NOHRE. Furthermore where applicable, geochronology
   may require taking into account the influence of the early plants on the
   NOHRE distributions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We perform experiments on jammed suspensions of microgels with different
   constituent properties to determine their stress relaxation behavior on
   flow cessation. We observe that the stress relaxes through a two-step
   process: A rapid initial relaxation where internal stresses are trapped
   followed by a much slower decay. Trapped internal stresses are related
   to the solvent viscosity, particle elasticity, and volume fraction
   through a universal scaling. The second slower relaxation of the
   internal stress is characterized by a single exponential decay, which is
   independent of the preshear stress and relatively insensitive to the
   material properties of the microgel suspension. Particle-scale
   simulations are used to understand the microscopic mechanisms which
   drive the amplitude and the kinetics of the stress relaxation as well as
   the local particle dynamics in each regime. The rapid initial relaxation
   occurs through ballistic particle motion, where the number of contacts
   and average compression return to their static values but the asymmetry
   of the pair distribution function remains as a signature of the internal
   stress. (C) 2015 The Society of Rheology.}},

Title = {{Hydroxylamine addition impact to Nitrosomonas europaea activity in the
   presence of monochloramine}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{719-730}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In drinking water, monochloramine may promote ammonia-oxidizing bacteria
   (AOB) growth because of concurrent ammonia presence. AOB use (i) ammonia
   monooxygenase for biological ammonia oxidation to hydroxylamine and (ii)
   hydroxylamine oxidoreductase for biological hydroxylamine oxidation to
   nitrite. In addition, monochloramine and hydroxylamine abiotically
   react, providing AOB a potential benefit by removing the disinfectant
   (monochloramine) and releasing growth substrate (ammonia). Alternatively
   and because biological hydroxylamine oxidation supplies the electrons
   (reductant) required for biological ammonia oxidation, the
   monochloramine/hydroxylamine abiotic reaction represents a possible
   inactivation mechanism by consuming hydroxylamine and inhibiting
   reductant generation. To investigate the abiotic monochloramine and
   hydroxylamine reaction's impact on AOB activity, the current study used
   batch experiments with Nitrosomonas europaea (AOB pure culture),
   ammonia, monochloramine, and hydroxylamine addition. To decipher whether
   hydroxylamine addition benefitted N. europaea activity by (i) removing
   monochloramine and releasing free ammonia or (ii) providing an
   additional effect (possibly the aforementioned reductant source), a
   previously developed cometabolism model was coupled with an abiotic
   monochloramine and hydroxylamine model for data interpretation. N.
   europaea maintained ammonia oxidizing activity when hydroxylamine was
   added before complete ammonia oxidation cessation. The impact could not
   be accounted for by monochloramine removal and free ammonia release
   alone and was concentration dependent for both monochloramine and
   hydroxylamine. In addition, a preferential negative impact occurred for
   ammonia versus hydroxylamine oxidation. These results suggest an
   additional benefit of exogenous hydroxylamine addition beyond
   monochloramine removal and free ammonia release, possibly providing
   reductant generation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Long test times and the use of conventional automatic test equipment
   (ATE) makes conventional mixed-signal linearity performance testing
   costly. Diminishing test time of linearity test significantly reduces
   system-on-a-chip production test costs and, therefore, lessens total
   product manufacturing costs. Several low-cost linearity test methods
   have addressed this issue for a single-ended mixed-signal circuit
   testing. On the other hand, a low-cost test approach has rarely been
   proposed for differential mixed-signal circuits, due to a new class of
   test obstacles from differential circuits that are widely employed for
   high-speed I/O products. This paper presents a cost-effective self-test
   methodology to characterize the linearity performance of differential
   mixed-signal circuits in loopback mode. The proposed method precisely
   predicts the device-under-test (DUT) linearity specifications by
   building accurate DUT nonlinear polynomial models using spectral
   specifications from recent work. The test cost is significantly reduced
   by replacing conventional ATE with the proposed self-test platform and
   by reducing test time to a fraction of conventional testing time.
   Hardware measurement results validated the test performance of the
   proposed test scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The rapidly increasing global demand for energy combined with the
   environmental impact of fossil fuels has spurred the search for
   alternative sources of clean energy. One promising approach is to
   convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel using photoelectrochemical
   cells. However, the semiconducting photoelectrodes used in these cells
   typically have low efficiencies and/or stabilities. Here we show that a
   silicon-based photocathode with a capping epitaxial oxide layer can
   provide efficient and stable hydrogen production from water. In
   particular, a thin epitaxial layer of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) was
   grown directly on Si(001) by molecular beam epitaxy. Photogenerated
   electrons can be transported easily through this layer because of the
   conduction-band alignment and lattice match between single-crystalline
   SrTiO3 and silicon. The approach was used to create a
   metal-insulator-semiconductor photocathode that, under a broad-spectrum
   illumination at 100 mW cm(-2), exhibits a maximum photocurrent density
   of 35 mA cm(-2) and an open circuit potential of 450 mV; there was no
   observable decrease in performance after 35 hours of operation in 0.5M
   H2SO4. The performance of the photocathode was also found to be highly
   dependent on the size and spacing of the structured metal catalyst.
   Therefore, mesh-like Ti/Pt nanostructured catalysts were created using a
   nanosphere lithography lift-off process and an applied-bias
   photon-to-current efficiency of 4.9\% was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of network coding across three unicast sessions
   over a directed acyclic graph, where the sender and receiver of each
   unicast session are both connected to the network via a single edge of
   unit capacity. We consider a network model in which the middle of the
   network can only perform random linear network coding, and restrict our
   approaches to precoding-based linear schemes, where the senders use
   precoding matrices to encode source symbols. We adapt a precoding-based
   interference alignment technique, originally developed for the wireless
   interference channel, to construct a precoding-based linear scheme,
   which we refer to as precoding-based network alignment scheme (PBNA). A
   primary difference between this setting and the wireless interference
   channel is that the network topology can introduce dependencies among
   the elements of the transfer matrix, which we refer to as coupling
   relations, and can potentially affect the achievable rate of PBNA. We
   identify all these coupling relations and interpret them in terms of
   network topology. We then present polynomial-time algorithms to check
   the presence of these coupling relations in a particular network.
   Finally, we show that, depending on the coupling relations present in
   the network, the optimal symmetric rate achieved by precoding-based
   linear scheme can take only three possible values, all of which can be
   achieved by PBNA.}},

   boost the charge transfer from such a bundle of nanofibers, we
   fabricated novel core-shell structures. Finally, we developed pressure
   sensors utilizing these fiber structures for endovascular applications.
   The sensors were tested in vitro under simulated physiological
   conditions. We observed significant improvements using core-shell
   electrospun fibers (4.5 times gain in signal intensity, 4000 mu V/mmHg
   sensitivity) over PVDF nanofibers (280 aeV/mmHg). The preliminary
   results showed that core-shell fiber-based devices exhibit nearly
   40-fold higher sensitivity,}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for improved molybdenum isotope covariance data for use
   in modeling a new uranium-molybdenum fuel form to be produced at the
   Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12). Covariance data correlate the
   uncertainty in an isotopic cross section at a particular energy to
   uncertainties at other energies. While high-fidelity covariance data
   exist for key isotopes, the low-fidelity covariance data available for
   most isotopes, including the natural molybdenum isotopes considered in
   this work, are derived from integral measurements without meaningful
   correlation between energy regions. This paper provides a framework for
   using the Bayesian R-matrix code SAMMY to derive improved isotopic
   resonance region covariance data from elemental experimental
   cross-section data. These resonance-wise covariance data were combined
   with integral uncertainty data from the Atlas of Neutron Resonances,
   uncertainty data generated via a dispersion method, and high-energy
   uncertainty data previously generated with the Empire-KALMAN code to
   produce an improved set of covariance data for the natural molybdenum
   isotopes. The improved covariance data sets, along with the associated
   resonance parameters, were inserted into JENDL4.0 data files for the
   molybdenum isotopes for use in data processing and modeling codes.
   Additionally, a series of critical experiments featuring the new
   U(19.5\%)-10Mo fuel form produced at Y-12 was designed. Along with
   existing molybdenum sensitive critical experiments, these were used to
   compare the performance of the new molybdenum covariance data against
   the existing low-fidelity evaluation. The new covariance data were found
   to result in reduced overall bias, reduced bias due to the molybdenum
   isotopes, and improved goodness of fit of computational to experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Based on observations of industrial construction sites, it is evident
   that most industrial projects do not effectively implement historically
   successful management practices that have the potential to improve
   construction productivity. Also, these practices are seldom implemented
   consistently from project to project. To help address this problem, the
   authors identified essential management practices for productivity
   improvement and developed the Best Productivity Practices Implementation
   Index for Industrial Projects (BPPII Industrial) based on these
   practices. The BPPII Industrial is a method and metric for assessing the
   planning and implementation levels of key practices needed to ensure
   high levels of labor productivity. The practices included in the
   proposed method are those that are widely accepted in academia and
   industry to have a positive impact on labor productivity. This paper
   presents the development, verification, and validation of the BPPII
   Industrial. This paper's primary contributions are the identification of
   key productivity practices, quantification of the relative importance of
   these practices, development of a method to assess the level of
   implementation of these practices on project productivity performance,
   and validation of the proposed method based on its implementation on
   several industrial projects. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Finite-element analyses are performed of centrifuge tests consisting of
   untreated and drain-treated lateral spread sites, with the goal of
   evaluating the ability of numerical simulations to predict the response
   of sites improved with prefabricated vertical drains. Finite-element
   models of varying complexity are analyzed: a two-dimensional model of
   the full centrifuge test, a three-dimensional unit cell model around a
   single drain, and a two-dimensional unit cell model. All the
   finite-element models predict pore pressures consistent with the
   centrifuge tests. The deformation responses of the finite-element models
   show that unit cell analyses produce significantly larger deformations
   than those observed in the centrifuge. This result is caused by the fact
   that the centrifuge test geometry is not well represented by the
   infinite slope condition assumed in a unit cell. The full
   two-dimensional model predicts deformations that are more consistent
   with those of the centrifuge because it can capture the rotational mode
   of deformation experienced in the centrifuge. These results indicate
   that the expected mode of deformation should be considered when
   selecting the appropriate finite-element model to analyze a site. The
   simulations also show that constitutive models for liquefiable soils
   significantly overestimate the volumetric stiffness, which leads to
   inaccurate modeling of the diffusion process unless the model is
   appropriately modified. This issue is critical when simulating the
   performance of drain-treated sites. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{The construction industry has struggled with the adoption of information

Abstract = {{The discretization of the double-layer potential integral equation for
   the interior Dirichlet-Laplace problem in a domain with smooth boundary
   results in a linear system that has a bounded condition number. Thus,
   the number of iterations required for the convergence of a Krylov method
   is, asymptotically, independent of the discretization size N. Using the
   fast multipole method to accelerate the matrix-vector products, we
   obtain an optimal O(N) solver. In practice, however, when the geometry
   is complicated, the number of Krylov iterations can be quite largeto the
   extend that necessitates the use of preconditioning. We summarize the
   different methodologies that have appeared in the literature
   (single-grid, multigrid, approximate sparse inverses), and we propose a
   new class of preconditioners based on a fast multipole method-based
   spatial decomposition of the double-layer operator. We present an
   experimental study in which we compare the different approaches, and we
   discuss the merits and shortcomings of our approach. Our method can be
   easily extended to other second-kind integral equations with

Abstract = {{Aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) has been extensively studied as a solvent
   for CO2 capture, yet the underlying reaction mechanisms are still not
   fully understood. Combined ab initio and classical molecular dynamics
   simulations were performed to revisit and identify key elementary
   reactions and intermediates in 25-30 wt\% aqueous MEA with CO2, by
   explicitly taking into account the structural and dynamic effects. Using
   static quantum chemical calculations, we also analyzed in more detail
   the fundamental interactions involved in the MEA-CO2 reaction. We find
   that both the CO2 capture by MEA and solvent regeneration follow a
   zwitterion-mediated two-step mechanism; from the zwitterionic
   intermediate, the relative probability between deprotonation (carbamate
   formation) and CO2 removal (MEA regeneration) tends to be determined
   largely by the interaction between the zwitterion and neighboring H2O
   molecules. In addition, our calculations clearly demonstrate that proton
   transfer in the MEA-CO2-H2O solution primarily occurs through H-bonded
   water bridges, and thus the availability and arrangement of H2O
   molecules also directly impacts the protonation and/or deprotonation of
   MEA and its derivatives. This improved understanding should contribute
   to developing more comprehensive kinetic models for use in modeling and
   optimizing the CO2 capture process. Moreover, this work highlights the
   importance of a detailed atomic-level description of the solution
   structure and dynamics in order to better understand molecular
   mechanisms underlying the reaction of CO2 with aqueous amines.}},

Title = {{A class of polysulfide catholytes for lithium-sulfur batteries: energy
   density, cyclability, and voltage enhancement}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-phase polysulfide catholytes are attracting much attention in
   lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries as they provide a facile dispersion and
   homogeneous distribution of the sulfur active material in the conductive
   matrix. However, the organic solvents used in lithium-polysulfide
   (Li-PS) batteries play an important role and have an impact on the
   physico-chemical characteristics of polysulfides. For instance,
   significantly higher voltages (similar to 2.7 V) of the S/S-n(2-) (4 <=
   n <= 8) redox couple are observed in Li-PS batteries with dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents. Accordingly,
   high power Li-PS batteries are presented here with the catholyte
   prepared with NMP solvent and operated with the highly reversible
   sulfur/long-chain polysulfide redox couple. On the other hand, a
   remarkable cyclability enhancement of the Li-PS battery is observed with
   the long-chain, ether-based tetraglyme (TEGDME) solvent. The voltage
   enhancement and the cyclability enhancement of the Li-PS batteries are
   attributed to the solvation effect, viscosity, and volatility of the
   solvents. Finally, highly concentrated polysulfide catholytes are
   successfully synthesized, with which high energy density Li-PS batteries
   are demonstrated by employing a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
   fabric electrode.}},

Abstract = {{Degenerative disc disease (DDD) induces chronic back pain with limited
   nonsurgical options. In this open label pilot study, 26 patients (median
   age 40 years; range 18-61) received autologous bone marrow concentrate
   (BMC) disc injections (13 one level, 13 two levels). Pretreatment
   Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) were
   performed to establish baseline pain scores (average 56.5 and 79.3,
   respectively), while magnetic resonance imaging was independently scored
   according to the modified Pfirrmann scale. Approximately 1 ml of BMC was
   analyzed for total nucleated cell (TNC) content, colony-forming
   unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) frequency, differentiation potential, and
   phenotype characterization. The average ODI and VAS scores were reduced
   to 22.8 and 29.2 at 3 months, 24.4 and 26.3 at 6 months, and 25.0 and
   33.2 at 12 months, respectively (p < .0001). Eight of twenty patients
   improved by one modified Pfirrmann grade at 1 year. The average BMC
   contained 121 3 10(6) TNC/ml with 2,713 CFU-F/ml (synonymous with
   mesenchymal stem cells). Although all subjects presented a substantial
   reduction in pain, patients receiving greater than 2,000 CFU-F/ml
   experienced a significantly faster and greater reduction in ODI and VAS.
   Subjects older than 40 years who received fewer than 2,000 CFU-F/ml
   experienced an average pain reduction of 33.7\% (ODI) and 29.1\% (VAS)
   at 12 months, while all other patients' average reduction was 69.5\%
   (ODI, p = .03) and 70.6\% (VAS, p = .01). This study provides evidence
   of safety and feasibility in the nonsurgical treatment of DDD with
   autologous BMC and indicates an effect of mesenchymal cell concentration
   on discogenic pain reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in finding small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria has significantly
   increased in recent years due to their regulatory functions. Development
   of high-throughput methods and more sophisticated computational
   algorithms has allowed rapid identification of sRNA candidates in
   different species. However, given their various sizes (50 to 500
   nucleotides {[}nt]) and their potential genomic locations in the 5' and
   3' untranslated regions as well as in intergenic regions, identification
   and validation of true sRNAs have been challenging. In addition, the
   evolution of bacterial sRNAs across different species continues to be
   puzzling, given that they can exert similar functions with various
   sequences and structures. In this study, we analyzed the enrichment
   patterns of sRNAs in 13 well-annotated bacterial species using existing
   transcriptome and experimental data. All intergenic regions were
   analyzed by WU-BLAST to examine conservation levels relative to species
   within or outside their genus. In total, more than 900 validated
   bacterial sRNAs and 23,000 intergenic regions were analyzed. The results
   indicate that sRNAs are enriched in intergenic regions, which are longer
   and more conserved than the average intergenic regions in the
   corresponding bacterial genome. We also found that sRNA-coding regions
   have different conservation levels relative to their flanking regions.
   This work provides a way to analyze how noncoding RNAs are distributed
   in bacterial genomes and also shows conserved features of intergenic
   regions that encode sRNAs. These results also provide insight into the
   functions of regions surrounding sRNAs and into optimization of RNA
   search algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual platform prototypes are widely used for early design space
   exploration at the system level. There is, however, a lack of accurate
   and fast power and performance models of hardware components at such
   high levels of abstraction. In this paper, we present an approach that
   extends fast functional hardware models with the ability to produce
   detailed, cycle-level timing and power estimates. Our approach is based
   on back-annotating behavioral hardware descriptions with a dynamic power
   and performance model that allows capturing cycle-accurate and
   data-dependent activity without a significant loss in simulation speed.
   By integrating with existing high-level synthesis (HLS) flows,
   back-annotation is fully automated for custom hardware synthesized by
   HLS. We further leverage state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to
   synthesize abstract power models, where we introduce a structural
   decomposition technique to reduce model complexities and increase
   estimation accuracy. We have applied our back-annotation approach to
   several industrial-strength design examples under various architecture
   configurations. Results show that our models predict average power
   consumption to within 1\% and cycle-by-cycle power dissipation to within
   10\% of a commercial gate-level power estimation tool, all while running
   several orders of magnitude faster.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new algorithm for attitude motion planning,
   Constrained Attitude Guidance (CAG) problem, in the presence of angular
   rate constraints and conic exclusion regions (pointing constraints). The
   CAG problem is solved by considering only the quaternion kinematics in
   the formulation and using constraints on quaternions and its time
   derivatives to indirectly apply bounds on the angular rates and
   accelerations. The CAG formulation makes use of Mixed Integer Convex
   Programming (MICP) in order to impose, approximately, the unity
   constraint on the quaternion magnitude, where the approximation accuracy
   can be set to a desired accuracy. The solution complexity of the MICP
   formulation increases exponentially with the number of binary variables
   that are used to impose the unit norm constraint on the quaternion.
   Since this number is independent of the number of exclusion pointing
   constraints, the solution approach has favorable complexity in terms of
   the number of pointing constraints. The paper also provides a numerical
   example that incorporates both angular rate and pointing constraints.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers stabilization of fully actuated rigid-body attitude
   dynamics in the absence of angular velocity measurements and presents
   new robustness results to bounded unknown external disturbance torques.
   In particular, it is assumed that only body orientation is measured in
   the form of a unit-quaternion signal. It is well known that the
   passivity properties of the dynamics allows design of velocity-free
   controllers using a first-order stable filter driven by measured states.
   When external disturbance torques are taken into account, however, the
   robustness properties of these passivity-based output feedback
   controllers cannot be readily analyzed because the Lyapunov-like
   function from which the controller is derived has a time-derivative that
   is only negative semidefinite, and therefore non-strict. This obstacle
   is circumvented through a new partial-strictification approach which
   ultimately allows the characterization of robustness properties for this

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of characterizing the optimal
   strategy for guiding the so-called Isotropic Rocket to a fixed target in
   the presence of a partially known flowfield. We reformulate the guidance
   problem into an equivalent two-player pursuit evasion game, where the
   evader has a modified vectogram. First, we characterize the optimal
   strategies for both players, assuming that the evader is capturable.
   Then, we derive the necessary condition for capture, and visualize the
   capturability envelope using numerical simulations in which we compute
   the level sets of the optimal value function (isochrones). In addition,
   we consider a more general case of the game, where the pursuer is
   affected by friction (or drag). In that case, we identify the capture
   zones from geometric properties of the isochrones.}},

Abstract = {{Fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are an increasingly common
   sensing platform, owing to their key advantages: speed, endurance and
   ability to explore remote areas. While these platforms are highly
   efficient, they cannot easily be equipped with air data sensors commonly
   found on their larger scale manned counterparts. Indeed, such sensors
   are bulky, expensive and severely reduce the payload capability of the
   UAVs. In consequence, UAV controllers (humans or autopilots) have little
   information on the actual mode of operation of the wing (normal,
   stalled, spin) which can cause catastrophic losses of control when
   flying in turbulent weather conditions. In this article, we propose a
   real-time air parameter estimation scheme that can run on commercial,
   low power autopilots in real-time. The computational method is based on
   a hybrid decomposition of the modes of operation of the UAV. A Bayesian
   approach is considered for estimation, in which the estimated airspeed,
   angle of attack and sideslip are described statistically. An
   implementation on a UAV is presented, and the performance and
   computational efficiency of this method are validated using hardware in
   the loop (HIL) simulation and experimental flight data and compared with
   classical Extended Kalman Filter estimation. Our benchmark tests shows
   that this method is faster than EKF by up to two orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{As the production, the variety, and the consumption of born digital
   video grows, so does the demand for acquiring, curating and preserving
   large-scale digital video collections. A multidisciplinary team of
   curators, computer scientists and video engineers we explore the use of
   Non-Reference Image and Video Quality Algorithms (I/VQA), speccally of
   BRISQUE in this paper, to automatically derive ranges of video quality.
   An important characteristic of these algorithms is that they are modeled
   to human perception. We run the algorithms in a High Performance
   Computing (HPC) environment to obtain results for many videos at the
   same time, accelerating time to results and precision in computing
   per-frame and per-video quality assessment scores. Results, which were
   evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, suggest that BRISQUE
   identifies the distortions in which it was trained, and performs well in
   videos that have natural scenes and do not have drastic scene changes.
   While we found that this particular model is not apt for evaluating
   collections with varied content, the results suggest that research into
   other I/VQA models is promising, and that their implementation at large
   scale can narrow the problem of curating very digital video collections
   and lead to preservation and access decisions based on informed
   priorities.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{When CO2 is sequestered into the deep subsurface, changes to the
   subsurface microbial community will occur. Capnophiles, microorganisms
   that grow in CO2-rich environments, are some organisms that may be
   selected for under the new environmental conditions. To determine
   whether capnophiles comprise an important part of CO2-rich environments,
   an isolate from Crystal Geyser, Utah, U.S.A., a CO2-rich spring
   considered a carbon sequestration analog, was characterized. The isolate
   was cultured under varying CO2, pH, salinity, and temperature, as well
   as different carbon substrates and terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) to
   elucidate growth conditions and metabolic activity. Designated CG-1, the
   isolate is related (99\%) to Lactobacillus casei in 16S rRNA gene
   identity, growing at PCO2 between 0 and 1.0 MPa. Growth is inhibited at
   2.5 MPa, but stationary phase cultures exposed to this pressure survive
   beyond 5 days. At 5.0 MPa, survival is at least 24 h. CG-1 grows in
   neutral pH, 0.25 M NaCl, and between 25 and 45 C and consumes glucose,
   lactose, sucrose, or crude oil, likely performing lactic acid
   fermentation. Fatty acid profiles between 0.1 and 1.0 MPa suggests
   decreases in cell size and increases in membrane rigidity. Transmission
   electron microscopy reveals rod shaped bacteria at 0.1 MPa. At 1.0 MPa,
   cells are smaller, amorphous, and produce abundant capsular material.
   Its ability to grow in environments regardless of the presence of CO2
   suggests we have isolated an organism that is more capnotolerant than
   capnophilic. Results also show that microorganisms are capable of
   surviving the stressful conditions created by the introduction of CO2
   for sequestration. Furthermore, our ability to culture an environmental
   isolate indicates that organisms found in CO2 environments from previous
   genomic and metagenomics studies are viable, metabolizing, and
   potentially affecting the surrounding environment.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RAIL TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{81-96}},
Abstract = {{China has developed plans to build 87 mass transit rail lines, totalling
   2500 km, in 25 cities from 2009 to 2015. The life-cycle costs of the
   urban rail transit systems have become the focus of both the government
   and the private sector involved in these large-scale investments.
   However, the availability of quality data has posed a major challenge to
   such life-cycle cost analyses; in other words, for any methodology to be
   effective, it must have the capability of working with very limited
   amount of available data, or small sample data. In this article, two
   cost assessment methodologies, fuzzy cluster and support vector machine,
   are proposed to analyse the life-cycle cost of urban rail transit
   systems based on small sample data. A case study featuring Line 1 of the
   Shijiazhuang urban rail transit system was employed to demonstrate the
   validity of the proposed methodologies. The analysis results indicate
   that the two assessment methodologies are valid for the life-cycle cost
   assessment of urban rail transit systems when only small sample data are
   available.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of noise abatement system consisting of arrays of tuneable
   air-filled acoustic resonators has been developed to attenuate
   underwater sound radiated by noise sources such as marine pile driving,
   offshore energy production, seismic sources, and ships, among others.
   Modelling and laboratory measurements were used to investigate the
   acoustic behavior of these resonators for the purpose of designing and
   building a noise abatement system accurately tuned for specific noise
   applications. System demonstrations that were conducted at two offshore
   wind farm construction sites in the North Sea in 2014 will be discussed.
   In these tests, peak sound pressure level reduction of nearly 40 dB was
   measured near the individual resonators' individual resonance frequency
   of approximately 100 Hz, and almost 20 dB sound exposure level reduction
   was measured in the 20 Hz to 20 kHz band. The method of deploying these
   resonator arrays in a collapsible framework, as well as the operational
   advantages of this system for pile driving, will be described. In
   addition, concepts for the application of this system to other noise
   sources, as well as future improvements of the resonators, will be
   presented. Finally, future planned demonstrations of the technology will
   be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise Web applications are moving towards server-side scripting
   using managed languages. Within this shifting context, event-driven
   programming is emerging as a crucial programming model to achieve
   scalability. In this paper, we study the microarchitectural implications
   of server-side scripting, JavaScript in particular, from a unique
   event-driven programming model perspective. Using the Node.js framework,
   we come to several critical microarchitectural conclusions. First,
   unlike traditional server-workloads such as CloudSuite and BigDataBench
   that are based on the conventional thread-based execution model,
   event-driven applications are heavily single-threaded, and as such they
   require significant single-thread performance. Second, the single-thread
   performance is severely limited by the front-end inefficiencies of
   today's server processor microarchitecture, ultimately leading to
   overall execution inefficiencies. The front-end inefficiencies stem from
   the unique combination of limited intra-event code reuse and large
   inter-event reuse distance. Third, through a deep understanding of
   event-specific characteristics, architects can mitigate the front-end
   inefficiencies of the managed-language-based event-driven execution via
   a combination of instruction cache insertion policy and prefetcher.}},

Abstract = {{The self-centering steel plate shear wall (SC-SPSW) combines the high
   lateral strength and stiffness of thin steel web plates, typically
   connected to beams and columns, with the recentering capabilities of
   post-tensioned (PT) beam-column connections to form a resilient
   structural system that sustains minimal boundary frame damage after
   severe ground shaking. To further improve structural economy,
   robustness, and constructability, a modified SC-SPSW with web plates
   connected only to the beams has been proposed as a means of reducing
   column demands and reducing localized strain demands in the web plate
   due to PT connection gap opening. Experimental and numerical
   investigations of SC-SPSWs with beam-only web plate connectivity have
   shown the beam-connected SC-SPSWs to have overall lighter steel weights,
   delayed onset and propagation of web plate tearing, and increased energy
   dissipation compared to SC-SPSWs of comparable strength with web plates
   connected to beams and columns. Results from these studies on SC-SPSWs
   suggest similar benefits from employing beam-connected web plates in
   conventional steel plate shear walls (SPSWs). This paper discusses the
   behavior of and design implications for beam-connected web plates in
   SPSWs and SC-SPSWs. Response of SC-SPSWs with beam-connected web plates
   from numerical models and experimental results are compared. Two
   three-story SC-SPSWs with beam-connected and fully-connected web plates
   was designed to have equal strength and the steel weight of each design
   is compared to address potential economic benefits from releasing the
   web plates from the columns. This research is of interest for university
   faculty and design professionals worldwide who focus on design of
   structural systems in high seismic regions. This presentation will
   provide design alternatives and highlight new research directions for
   improving economy, constructability, and resiliency of SPSWs.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the previous studies on porous pavement, whether pervious
   concrete, porous asphalt, or interlocking concrete pavers, have focused
   on the water balance and attempted to quantify the reduction in
   discharge volume that occurs. However, in many areas infiltration
   capacity is limited and these systems must be installed with
   underdrains. This paper describes the results of a year-long monitoring
   program to document the quality of water discharged from the underdrain
   system of a parking lot with permeable interlocking concrete pavers. The
   monitoring site is located on the Texas State University campus in San
   Marcos, Texas. The system was installed with an impermeable liner
   because of concerns about groundwater contamination in the area;
   consequently, all the runoff which entered the pavement was discharged
   through the underdrain. Roof runoff from an adjacent building also
   discharges to the permeable interlocking concrete pavement, which has a
   reservoir layer that is 19 inches deep. Monitoring of the water quality
   demonstrated substantial variation in the concentrations of suspended
   solids and other common stormwater constituents. Concentrations of TSS
   and E. coli in the discharge appeared to be positively correlated
   rainfall intensity with the highest values associated with the most
   intense events. It appears that a significant reason for this variation
   is the additional volume contributed by the offsite roof area.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in the reuse of flowback and produced water
   in slickwater hydraulic fracturing is the compatibility between
   additives and high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations, which
   are the most difficult contaminants to remove. Typical polyacrylamide
   friction reducers show reduced effectiveness in water with high ionic
   content, so water must either be treated or diluted with freshwater to
   reduce salt content before reuse.
   The case for directly reusing produced water with high salt content is
   presented in this research. The first part of the study ascertains the
   effectiveness of various friction reducers in brines. While typical
   polyacrylamide friction reducers lose their efficacy at high salt
   concentrations, we have identified other polymers that are generally
   resistant to changes in salt concentration. The second part of the
   research assesses not only the effect of pumping high-TDS water into a
   formation, but also the impacts of salt-tolerant friction reducers on
   shale stability and fracture conductivity. Shale compatibility
   experiments determined that injecting water with a higher salinity into
   a water-sensitive formation can benefit shale stability. In addition,
   the friction reducing agents were shown to have secondary stabilizing
   effects on shale.}},

Abstract = {{Household sewage causes several problems if not managed properly.
   Centralized wastewater treatment systems have long been considered the
   preferred form of sewage treatment, but they can be expensive. Several
   decentralized wastewater technologies can manage household sewage safely
   and effectively and may appear to be less expensive than centralized
   systems on a life cycle cost basis.
   Homeowners may be reluctant to bear the costs of these technologies,
   forcing municipalities to weigh the expense of monetary incentives to
   householders against the costs of centralized systems. Accurate life
   cycle cost comparisons rely on the use of discount rates representative
   of the appropriate investors. Centralized systems are typically financed
   by public municipalities, who use market interest rates or ``social{''}
   discount rates in life cycle cost calculations, whereas homeowners have
   been observed to demonstrate much higher ``implicit discount rates.{''}
   When system costs are compared using appropriate discount rates,
   decentralized systems might lose their cost advantage. We examine this
   phenomenon with two case studies. The methodology developed herein can
   be applied to any case in which centralized and decentralized
   technologies may be appropriate solutions; it also gives a basis for
   sound decisions about incentivizing homeowner adoption of decentralized
   technologies.}},

Title = {{Validating predictions of unobserved quantities}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate purpose of most computational models is to make
   predictions, commonly in support of some decision-making process (e.g.,
   for design or operation of some system). The quantities that need to be
   predicted (the quantities of interest or QoIs) are generally not
   experimentally observable before the prediction, since otherwise no
   prediction would be needed. Assessing the validity of such extrapolative
   predictions, which is critical to informed decision-making, is
   challenging. In classical approaches to validation, model outputs for
   observed quantities are compared to observations to determine if they
   are consistent. By itself, this consistency only ensures that the model
   can predict the observed quantities under the conditions of the
   observations. This limitation dramatically reduces the utility of the
   validation effort for decision making because it implies nothing about
   predictions of unobserved QoIs or for scenarios outside of the range of
   observations. However, there is no agreement in the scientific community
   today regarding best practices for validation of extrapolative
   predictions made using computational models. The purpose of this paper
   is to propose and explore a validation and predictive assessment process
   that supports extrapolative predictions for models with known sources of
   error. The process includes stochastic modeling, calibration,
   validation, and predictive assessment phases where representations of
   known sources of uncertainty and error are built, informed, and tested.
   The proposed methodology is applied to an illustrative extrapolation
   problem involving a misspecified nonlinear oscillator. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Volume = {{106}},

Abstract = {{The influence of barometric cycling on gas transport through complex
   media can be described using a double porosity model. Here vertical
   channels simulate the effect of cracks that pass through homogeneous
   regions of media. The cracks are coupled to the atmosphere and act as
   boundaries for the sections of homogeneous media. Convection-diffusion
   models are then used to simulate gas transport through the coupled
   system. This approach has been used to model soil aeration, subsurface
   movement of volatile compounds, and the migration of gases to the
   surface after below ground nuclear detonations. In the present work, we
   describe four stable numerical methods that can be used to implement the
   double porosity model when first-order reactions produce and consume the
   gaseous species of interest. We find that all four methods satisfy
   analytical crosschecks and agree to at least seven digits of precision.
   An iterative solver based on Newton's method is found to be optimal as
   it is easily scalable to 3-D models and to multithreaded execution.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on the influence of different filler loadings on the
   elongation at break and flammability properties of the PA11/FR/HNTs
   nanocomposites. Polyamide 11 (PA11)/flame-retardant (FR)
   additives/halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) nanocomposites were melt
   compounded via twin-screw extrusion for all the compositions. Three FR
   additive loadings (15, 20, and 25 wt\%) and three HNTs loadings (2.5, 5,
   and 10 wt\%) were selected. The formula with 25 \% FR and 2.5 \% HNT had
   the lowest additives content and the highest elongation at break of
   10.22 \% among all UL-94 V-0 rated formulas. A homogeneous dispersion of
   HNTs in PA11 matrix was observed by transmission electron microscopy.
   Differential scanning calorimeter measurements indicated that HNTs
   behaved as nucleating agents by accelerating the rate of
   crystallization, thus increasing crystallization temperature. The
   young's modulus of the PA11 nanocomposites was enhanced with the
   addition of HNTs. Micro-scale combustion calorimeter results
   demonstrated that the addition of HNTs also decreased the peak heat
   release rate of the nanocomposites. These results indicate the
   effectiveness of HNTs on the mechanical, thermal, and flame-retardant
   performance of PA11/FR/HNTs nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{Nanowell structure has been attractive in plasmonics, surface enhanced
   Raman scattering, nanocrystal synthesis, and biomolecular
   immobilization. Conventional nanowell structures have been carved into
   continuous thin metal films. This letter focuses on the fabrication and
   characterization of triangular gold nanowell arrays embedded in a
   back-filled non-metallic and transparent substrate. The nanowell
   dimensions can be controlled to produce an optically tunable localized
   surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) as a plasmonic sensor. AFM and LSPR
   spectroscopy confirm that the triangular Au nanowell structures are
   partially embedded in the surface of a transparent glass substrate to
   protect the shape and sharp features of the nanowell. Experimental
   spectral results and numerical calculations show that the extinction
   maximum of the LSPR is located in the NIR range, and correlates linearly
   with the base thickness of the nanowell. Numerical calculations to
   analyze the extinction spectrum of gold nanowell show that scattering of
   the nanostructure is dominant to compare to its absorption. LSPR-tunable
   nanowells can potentially be used for plasmonic sensors and biomolecular
   docking system platforms.}},

Abstract = {{We report a quantum dot (QD)-based light emitting diode (LED) structure
   with a solution processed zinc oxide electron transporting layer, with
   patterning of anode and cathode on the substrate toward cellular imaging
   applications. Compared with the use of sputtered thin films, solution
   processed electron transporting layer improves robustness of the device,
   as crystalline ZnO shows low CB and VB edge energy levels, efficiently
   suppressing hole leakage current resulting in LEDs with longer
   lifetimes. We demonstrate a working lifetime of more than 12 h and a
   shelf-life of more than 180 days for the devices. Our solution-based
   process is applicable to microcontact printed and also spin-coated QD
   films. Further, we demonstrate electroluminescence of QD LEDs at 580-
   and 600-nm emission wavelengths, with typical turn-ON voltage of 12 V.
   We compare operating characteristics of an array of individually
   addressable LEDs fabricated on a single substrate, with average size of
   each element being 800 mu m x 200 mu m. The LEDs with spin-coated ETL
   show a lifetime increase of more than three orders of magnitude compared
   with devices made using sputtered ETL layer. We find marginal increases
   in the intensity and uniformity of devices fabricated using a
   spin-coated ZnO layer. Finally, we demonstrate a compact multicolor
   light source for cell characterizations by imaging HEMA 3 stained MDA-MB
   231 breast cancer cells on-chip. We demonstrate the capability of the
   devices as a light source by measuring intensity across stained cells
   with QDLEDs of two different wavelengths and show the correlation as
   expected with the absorption profile of the fluorescent dye.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{323}},
Pages = {{78-81}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) are both recognized as a promising anode
   material for high-energy lithium-ion batteries. Si is abundant and best
   known for its superior gravimetric energy storage capacity, while Ge
   exhibits faster charge/discharge rates and better capacity retention.
   Recently, it was discovered that Si lithiation exhibits strong
   orientation dependence while Ge lithiation proceeds isotropically,
   although they have the same crystalline structure. To better understand
   the underlying reasons behind these distinctive differences, we examine
   and compare the lithiation behaviors at the Li4Si/c-Si(1 1 0) and
   Li4Ge/c-Ge(1 1 0) model systems using ab initio molecular dynamics
   simulations. In comparison to lithiated c-Si, where a sharp
   amorphous-crystalline interface remains and advances rather slowly,
   lithiated c-Ge tends to loose its crystallinity rapidly, resulting in a
   graded lithiation front of fast propagation speed. Analysis of the
   elastic responses and dynamics of the host Si and Ge lattices clearly
   demonstrate that from the beginning of the lithiation process, Ge
   lattice responds with more significant weakening as compared to the
   rigid Si lattice. Moreover, the more flexible Ge lattice is found to
   undergo facile atomic rearrangements during lithiation, overshadowing
   the original crystallographic characteristic. These unique properties of
   Ge thereby contribute synergistically to the rapid and isotropic
   lithiation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In single-molecule pulling experiments, the molecule of interest is
   attached to a much larger object such as an atomic force microscope tip
   or a micrometer sized bead. The measured dynamics of molecular
   transitions is therefore affected by the hydrodynamic drag on the
   pulling instrument itself. By considering the transitions within the
   combined system (the molecule and the instrument), it is shown here that
   two distinct physical regimes exist: when the intrinsic stiffness of the
   molecule is greater than that of the linker connecting the molecule to
   the pulling setup then the pulling experiment probes the intrinsic
   dynamics of the molecule with only relatively small (and quantifiable)
   corrections resulting from the pulling setup. In contrast, when the
   stiffness of the linker exceeds that of the molecule, the molecular
   transition in question involves concerted motion of the molecule and the
   pulling setup and the hydrodynamic drag on the pulling instrument
   becomes the dominant source of friction along the molecular reaction
   coordinate. An analytical formula interpolating between these two cases
   is further derived. These results explain recent conflicting
   observations where some single-molecule pulling measurements report
   anomalously low diffusion coefficients along molecular reaction
   coordinates while others do not. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Coarse-graining in simulations of multicomponent polymer systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the mapping required between the interaction parameters
   of two different coarse-grained simulation models to ensure a match of
   the long-range structural characteristics of multicomponent polymeric
   system. The basis for our studies is the recent work of Morse and
   workers, which demonstrated the existence of a mapping between the
   interaction parameters of different coarse-grained simulation models
   which allow for a matching of the peak of the disordered state structure
   factor in symmetric diblock copolymers. We investigate the extensibility
   of their results to other polymeric systems by studying a variety of
   systems, including, asymmetric diblock copolymers, symmetric triblock
   copolymers, and diblock copolymer-solvent mixtures. By using the mapping
   deduced in the context of symmetric diblock copolymers, we observe
   excellent agreement for peak in the inverse structure between both two
   popular coarse grained models for all sets of polymeric melt systems
   investigated, thus showing that the mapping function proposed for
   diblock copolymer melts is transferable to other polymer melts
   irrespective of the blockiness or overall composition. Interestingly,
   for the limited parameter range of polymer-solvent systems investigated
   in this article, the mapping functions developed for polymer melts are
   shown to be equally effective in mapping the structure factor of the
   coarse-grained simulation models. We use our findings to propose a
   methodology to create ordered morphologies in simulations involving hard
   repulsive potentials in a computationally efficient manner. We
   demonstrate the outcomes of methodology by creating lamellar and
   cylindrical phases of diblock copolymers of long chains in the popularly
   used Kremer-Grest simulation model. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The vibronic coupling model of Koppel, Domcke, and Cederbaum is a
   powerful means to understand, predict, and analyze electronic spectra of
   molecules, especially those that exhibit phenomena that involve
   breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In this work, we
   describe a new parallel algorithm for carrying out such calculations.
   The algorithm is conceptually founded upon a stencil representation of
   the required computational steps, which motivates an efficient strategy
   for coarse-grained parallelization. The equations involved in the
   direct-CI type diagonalization of the model Hamiltonian are presented,
   the parallelization strategy is discussed in detail, and the method is
   illustrated by calculations involving direct-product basis sets with as
   many as 17 vibrational modes and 130 billion basis functions.}},

Abstract = {{Nonaqueous solvents in modern battery technologies undergo
   electroreduction at negative electrodes, leading to the formation of a
   solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). The mechanisms and reactions leading
   to a stable SEI on silicon electrodes in lithium-ion batteries are still
   poorly understood. This lack of understanding inhibits the rational
   design of electrolyte additives, active material coatings, and the
   prediction of Li-ion battery life in general. We prepared SEI with a
   common nonaqueous solvent (LiPF6 in PC and in EC/DEC 1:1 by wt \%) on
   silicon oxide and etched silicon (001) surfaces in various states of
   lithiation to understand the role of surface chemistry on the SEI
   formation mechanism and SEI structure. Anhydrous and anoxic techniques
   were used to prevent air and moisture contamination of prepared SEI
   films, allowing for more accurate characterization of SEI chemical
   stratification and composition by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth
   profiling. Additionally, multivariate statistical methods were used to
   better understand TOF-SIMS depth profiling studies. We conclude that the
   absence of native-oxide layer on silicon has a significant impact on the
   formation, composition, structure, and thickness of the SEI.}},

Abstract = {{Yi(1-x)InBaCo(3)ZnO(7+delta) (0 <= x <= 0.5) oxides have been
   investigated as cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).
   While YBaCO3ZnO7+delta is observed to decompose after 120 h exposure to
   SOFC operating temperatures (600-700 degrees C), all the In-substituted
   compositions following Y0.9In0.1BaCo3ZnO7+delta are phase stable in the
   range of 600-800 degrees C. The substitution of In in the range of 0 < x
   <= 0.5 shows a negligible impact on the polarization resistances and
   activation energies of Y1-xInxBaCo3 ZnO7+delta + GdO2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC)
   composite cathodes on 8 mol\% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ)
   electrolytes. The polarization resistances of YBaCo3ZnO7+delta (YBC3Z) +
   GDC cathodes decrease with decreasing electrolyte particle size,
   suggesting a strong dependence on the three-phase boundary region. Also,
   YBC3Z + GDC cathodes in symmetric cells on both 8YSZ and GDC
   electrolytes shows superior performance in the range of 400-600 degrees
   C compared to the well-studied Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF)
   cathode. With a low thermal expansion coefficient, low intermediate
   temperature polarization resistances, and good phase stability, the
   Y0.9In0.1BaCo3ZnO7+delta oxide is an attractive cathode candidate for
   low and intermediate temperature SOFCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{All clinically approved antibodies are of the IgG isotype and mediate
   the clearance of target cells via binding to Fc gamma receptors and
   complement (C1q). Even though IgA can elicit powerful cytotoxic action
   via Fc alpha RI receptor binding, IgA antibodies have not been amenable
   to therapeutic development. Here, we report the engineering of a
   ``cross-isotype{''} antibody, IgGA, which combines the effector
   functions of both IgG and IgA. IgGA binds to Fc alpha RI with an
   affinity comparable to that of IgA, and to the activating Fc gamma
   receptors, Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RIIa, with high affinity, and
   displays increased binding to C1q compared to IgG. Unlike
   trastuzumab-IgG, trastuzumab-IgGA potently activates both neutrophils
   and macrophages to kill Her2(+) cancer cells. Furthermore, IgGA mediates
   greater complement-dependent cytotoxicity than IgG1 or IgA antibodies.
   The multitude of IgGA effector functions could be important for
   therapeutic purposes and highlights the concept of engineering
   antibodies that combine effector functions from multiple antibody
   isotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Emissions of phthalates and phthalate alternatives from vinyl flooring
   and crib mattress covers were measured in a specially designed chamber.
   The gas-phase concentrations versus time were measured at four different
   temperatures, that is, 25, 36, 45, and 55 degrees C. The key parameter
   that controls the emissions (y(0), gas-phase concentration in
   equilibrium with the material phase) was determined, and the emissions
   were found to increase significantly with increasing temperature. Both
   the material-phase concentration (C-0) and the chemical vapor pressure
   (V-p) were found to have great influence on the value of y(0). The
   measured ratios of C-0 to y(0) were exponentially proportional to the
   reciprocal of temperature, in agreement with the vant Hoff equation. A
   emission model was validated at different temperatures, with excellent
   agreement between model calculations and chamber observations. In
   residential homes, an increase in the temperature from 25 to 35 degrees
   C can elevate the gas-phase concentration of phthalates by more than a
   factor of 10, but the total airborne concentration may not increase that
   much for less volatile compounds. In infant sleep microenvironments, an
   increase in the temperature of mattress can cause a significant increase
   in emission of phthalates from the mattress cover and make the
   concentration in the infants breathing zone about four times higher than
   that in the bulk room air, resulting in potentially high exposure.}},

Title = {{Calibrated analytical element for lateral-strength degradation of
   reinforced concrete columns}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{35-48}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{An analytical element is proposed to simulate the cyclic nonlinear
   lateral-strength behavior of reinforced concrete columns. The element
   possesses a unique and novel combination of functionalities that allow
   increased accuracy of simulation as well as ease of use. Key
   functionalities are: (1) the ability to simulate cyclic as well as
   in-cycle strength degradation including hysteretic pinching and damage
   accumulation, (2) the ability to monitor column boundary condition and
   adjust behavior accordingly, (3) full calibration to a dataset of column
   tests allowing users to only define column material and geometric
   properties for the element to automatically determine all cyclic
   behavior parameters. Parameters of the material model governing the
   element were related through regression analyses to predictor variables
   to arrive at governing relations for the parameters. In the process of
   calibrating model parameters, correlations were uncovered that provide
   insight into mechanisms that affect column cyclic lateral-strength. The
   proposed element and material model were calibrated to simulate the
   seismic behavior of lightly confined reinforced concrete columns that
   experience flexural yielding prior to sustaining lateral-strength
   degradation through a shear failure mechanism. Calibration to other
   column types is the subject of future work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Reacting ortho-functional poly(hydroxyimide)s via a high-temperature
   (i.e., 350 degrees C-450 degrees C) solid-state reaction produces
   polymers with exceptional gas separation properties for separations such
   as CO2/CH4, CO2/N-2, and H-2/CH4. However, these reactions render these
   so-called thermally rearranged (TR) polymers insoluble in common
   solvents, which prevent the use of certain experimental characterization
   techniques such as solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) from
   identifying their chemical structure. In this work, we seek to identify
   the chemical structure of TR polymers by synthesizing a partially
   soluble TR polymer from an ortho-functional poly(hydroxyamide). The
   chemical structure of this TR polymer was characterized using 1-D and
   2-D NMR. By use of cross-polarization magic-angle spinning C-13 NMR, the
   structure of the polyamide-based TR polymer was compared to that of a
   polyimide-based TR polymer with a nearly identical proposed structure.
   The NMR spectra suggest that oxazole functionality is formed for both of
   these TR polymers. Furthermore, gas permeation results are provided for
   the precursor polymers and their corresponding TR polymer. The
   differences in transport properties for these polymers result from
   differences in the isomeric nature of oxazole-aromatic linkages and
   morphological differences related to free volume and free volume
   distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about variations in electricity use at finely-resolved
   timescales, or the drivers for those variations. Using measured
   electricity use data from 103 homes in Austin, TX, this analysis sought
   to (1) determine the shape of seasonally-resolved residential demand
   profiles, (2) determine the optimal number of normalized representative
   residential electricity use profiles within each season, and (3) draw
   correlations to the different profiles based on survey data from the
   occupants of the 103 homes. Within each season, homes with similar
   hourly electricity use patterns were clustered into groups using the
   k-means clustering algorithm. Then probit regression was performed to
   determine if homeowner survey responses could serve as predictors for
   the clustering results. This analysis found that Austin homes fall into
   one of two seasonal groups with some homes using more expensive
   electricity (from a wholesale electricity market perspective) than
   others. Regression results indicate that variables such as if someone
   works from home, hours of television watched per week, and education
   levels have significant correlations with average profile shape, but
   might vary across seasons. The results herein also indicate that
   policies such as time-of-use or real-time electricity structures might
   be more likely to affect lower income households during some high
   electricity use parts of the year. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{248-255}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Ultrasonic wave methods have been extensively investigated for
   monitoring the setting and hardening process of cementitious materials.
   However, the commonly used P wave velocity parameter is affected by air
   voids in the material in the fresh state. In addition, the conventional
   ultrasonic wave velocity test setup typically needs access to both sides
   of a structural member, which is not always possible for in-situ field
   testing. The ultrasonic shear wave reflection method measures the
   acoustic property of the near surface material only. In this paper,
   ultrasonic shear waves, measured by embedded piezoceramic bender
   elements, are used to monitor the setting and hardening process of
   mortar and concrete. Experimental results from mortar and concrete
   mixtures with different water to cement ratios show a clear relationship
   between the shear wave velocity and the penetration resistance (ASTM
   C403), which indicates that the shear wave velocity is a more reliable
   indicator than the P wave velocity for in-situ monitoring of the setting
   and hardening process of cementitious materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Effect of chemical composition on rheology and mechanical properties of
   asphalt binder}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{293-300}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Asphalt binder imparts most of its characteristics to the asphalt
   concrete mixture and also dictates several forms of distresses in
   asphalt mixtures and pavements. The chemical makeup of the asphalt
   binder dictates its rheological and mechanical properties. The objective
   of this study was to investigate the effect of the relative
   concentration of different polar fractions on the rheology and tensile
   strength of asphalt binders. Two different binders were separated into
   four (SARA) fractions based on their polarity. The fractions were
   individually doped in the original binder to produce four derivative
   binders from each of the two parent binders. Dynamic shear moduli and
   tensile strengths of the asphalt binders were measured using a dynamic a
   shear rheometer (DSR) and a tension-compression machine, respectively.
   The results show that an increase in the concentration of polar
   fractions resulted in an increase in both the stiffness and tensile
   strength of the binder. Addition of more polar fractions resulted in a
   substantial increase in stiffness at lower frequencies of loading but
   this increase was not as substantial at higher frequencies of loading.
   Observation of the failure surfaces from the poker-chip test also
   revealed that binders with higher polar fractions that had higher
   stiffness and tensile strength also had higher number and smaller size
   cavities that resulted in crack nucleation and failure. The findings
   from this study can help better understand the behavior of aged and
   chemically modified asphalt binders and also engineer better performing
   binders for pavement applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{270}},
Pages = {{101-105}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A part of carbon additives in sulfur cathodes is replaced by
   lithium-insertion compounds as they can contribute extra capacity and
   increase the overall energy density. Accordingly, VO2(B) and TiS2 were
   incorporated into sulfur cathodes as they can work within the same
   voltage window as that of sulfur. However, VO2(B) was found to be
   incompatible with the glyme-based electrolytes that are usually used in
   Li-S cells, but TiS2 performs well while coupled with sulfur. The
   S/C/TiS2 composite cathode delivers 252 mAh g(-1) more than that of
   pristine sulfur cathode (1334 mAh g(-1) vs. 1082 mAh g(-1)). The
   increased capacity is not only due to the contribution by TiS2 itself
   but also due to a better active-material dispersion and utilization.
   Serving as active reaction sites during cycling, TiS2 suppresses
   agglomeration of sulfur and facilitates better ionic! electronic
   transport within the cathode structure. This composite cathode design
   provides another direction for Li-S batteries to improve the overall
   energy density. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Single-walled carbon nanotubes increase pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus
   infectivity of lung epithelial cells}},
Journal = {{PARTICLE AND FIBRE TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Background: Airborne exposure to nanomaterials from unintended
   occupational or environmental exposures or as a consequence of product
   use may lead to adverse health effects. Numerous studies have focused on
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their ability to cause
   pulmonary injury related to fibrosis, and cancer; however few studies
   have addressed their impact on infectious agents, particularly viruses
   that are known for causing severe disease. Here we have demonstrated the
   ability of pristine SWCNTs of diverse electronic structure to increase
   the susceptibility of small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) to pandemic
   influenza A H1N1 infection and discerned potential mechanisms of action
   driving this response.
   Methods: Small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were exposed to three
   types of SWCNTs with varying electronic structure (SG65, SG76, CG200)
   followed by infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (pH1N1). Cells were then
   assayed for viral infectivity by immunofluorescence and viral titers. We
   quantified mRNA and protein levels of targets involved in inflammation
   and anti-viral activity (INF beta 1, IL-8, RANTES/CCL5, IFIT2, IFIT3,
   ST3GAL4, ST6GAL1, IL-10), localized sialic acid receptors, and assessed
   mitochondrial function. Hyperspectral imaging analysis was performed to
   map the SWCNTs and virus particles in fixed SAEC preparations. We
   additionally performed characterization analysis to monitor SWCNT
   aggregate size and structure under biological conditions using dynamic
   light scattering (DLS), static light scattering (SLS).
   Results: Based on data from viral titer and immunofluorescence assays,
   we report that pre-treatment of SAEC with SWCNTs significantly enhances
   viral infectivity that is not dependent on SWCNT electronic structure
   and aggregate size within the range of 106 nm - 243 nm. We further
   provide evidence to support that this noted effect on infectivity is not
   likely due to direct interaction of the virus and nanoparticles, but
   rather a combination of suppression of pro-inflammatory (RANTES) and
   anti-viral (IFIT2, IFIT3) gene/protein expression, impaired
   mitochondrial function and modulation of viral receptors by SWCNTs.
   Conclusions: Results of this work reveal the potential for SWCNTs to
   increase susceptibility to viral infections as a mechanism of adverse
   effect. These data highlight the importance of investigating the ability
   of carbon-nanomaterials to modulate the immune system, including impacts
   on anti-viral mechanisms in lung cells, thereby increasing
   susceptibility to infectious agents.}},

Title = {{Paramagnetic Beads and Magnetically Mediated Strain Enhance
   Cardiomyogenesis in Mouse Embryoid Bodies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical forces play an important role in proper embryologic
   development, and similarly such forces can directly impact pluripotency
   and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) in vitro. In
   addition, manipulation of the embryoid body (EB) microenvironment, such
   as by incorporation of microspheres or microparticles, can similarly
   influence fate determination. In this study, we developed a mechanical
   stimulation regimen using permanent neodymium magnets to magnetically
   attract cells within an EB. Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid
   (RGD)-conjugated paramagnetic beads were incorporated into the interior
   of the EBs during aggregation, allowing us to exert force on individual
   cells using short-term magnetization. EBs were stimulated for one hour
   at different magnetic field strengths, subsequently exerting a range of
   force intensity on the cells at different stages of early EB
   development. Our results demonstrated that following exposure to a 0.2
   Tesla magnetic field, ESCs respond to magnetically mediated strain by
   activating Protein Kinase A (PKA) and increasing phosphorylated
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) expression. The
   timing of stimulation can also be tailored to guide ESC differentiation:
   the combination of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) supplementation
   with one hour of magnetic attraction on Day 3 enhances cardiomyogenesis
   by increasing contractile activity and the percentage of sarcomeric
   a-actin-expressing cells compared to control samples with BMP4 alone.
   Interestingly, we also observed that the beads alone had some impact on
   differentiation by increasingly slightly, albeit not significantly, the
   percentage of cardiomyocytes. Together these results suggest that
   magnetically mediated strain can be used to enhance the percentage of
   mouse ESC-derived cardiomyocytes over current differentiation protocols.}},

   batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{269}},
Pages = {{848-854}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Tin-antimony alloy (SnSb) particles dispersed in a conductive matrix
   comprised of TiC and carbon have been synthesized by high energy
   mechanical milling (HEMM) and explored as anodes for sodium-ion
   batteries. The SnSb TiC C samples have been prepared with different TiC
   and carbon contents in the composite, characterized by X-ray diffraction
   before and after sodiation and by high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy, and compared to SnSb C as a baseline. The SnSb TiC C anodes
   demonstrate better cyclic performance as well as better rate-capability
   compared to SnSb C. In addition, the increase in TiC content in the
   composite leads to better electrochemical performance.
   SnSb-TiC(40\%)-C(20\%) and SnSb-TiC(40\%)-C(30\%) electrodes exhibit the
   best electrochemical performance, which could result from both the
   well-developed SnSb as an electrochemically active nanocrystalline
   material and the conductive matrix composed of a combination of TiC and
   carbon. Additionally, the use of FEC electrolyte additive results in
   much better electrochemical performance even at high-rate current
   density when combined with this material due to the formation of a
   stable and thin SEI layer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-wavelength semiconductor laser arrays (MLAs) have wide
   applications in wavelength multiplexing division (WDM) networks. In
   spite of their tremendous potential, adoption of the MLA has been

   which the wavelengths of each channel can be determined precisely
   through low-cost standard mu m-level photolithography/holographic
   lithography and the
   reconstruction-equivalent-chirp (REC) technique. 60-wavelength MLAs with
   good wavelength spacing uniformity have been demonstrated
   experimentally, in which nearly 83\% lasers are within a wavelength
   deviation of +/- 0.20 nm, corresponding to a tolerance of +/- 0.032 nm
   in the period pitch. As a result of employing the equivalent phase shift
   technique, the single longitudinal mode (SLM) yield is nearly 100\%,
   while the theoretical yield of standard DFB lasers is only around
   33.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Charge transport and recombination mechanisms within organic bulk
   heterojunction (BHJ) systems have been studied using lateral devices to
   perform in situ potentiometry. We have developed a simplified
   measurement technique using two types of lateral structures to elicit
   key charge transport parameters and study the time and process
   dependence of the carrier mobilities and their ratio. Small geometry
   lateral devices are used to evaluate the mobility of the slower carrier
   within the P3HT:PCBM material system. Larger structures with 5 in situ
   voltage probes are used to construct a simple potential profile of the
   device channel and accurately determine the carrier mobility ratio.
   These two measurements enable the calculation of carrier densities and
   the recombination coefficient. We monitor the change in these parameters
   as the P3HT: PCBM film degrades in the presence of oxygen and also
   examine the effect of the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane on this
   degradation mechanism. By exposing ethanol vapor to the BHJ film, we
   induce traps in the material and monitor the shift in dominant
   nongeminate recombination mechanism to a more unimolecular type. We are
   also able to measure the resulting decrease in carrier mobilities due to
   the presence of dipole-induced traps. Lateral devices are useful
   material diagnostic structures for studying degradation in BHJ

Title = {{Peak power prediction of a vanadium redox flow battery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{268}},
Pages = {{261-268}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is a promising grid-scale energy
   storage technology, but future widespread commercialization requires a
   considerable reduction in capital costs. Determining the appropriate
   battery size for the intended power range can help minimize the amount
   of materials needed, thereby reducing capital costs. A physics-based
   model is an essential tool for predicting the power range of large scale
   VRFB systems to aid in the design optimization process. This paper
   presents a modeling framework that accounts for the effects of flow rate
   on the pumping losses, local mass transfer rate, and nonuniform vanadium
   concentration in the cell. The resulting low-order model captures
   battery performance accurately even at high power densities and remains
   computationally practical for stack-level optimization and control
   purposes. We first use the model to devise an optimal control strategy
   that maximizes battery life during discharge. Assuming optimal control
   is implemented, we then determine the upper efficiency limits of a given
   VRFB system and compare the net power and associated overpotential and
   pumping losses at different operating points. We also investigate the
   effects of varying the electrode porosity, stack temperature, and total
   vanadium concentration on the peak power. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Production scheduling and process control have the common aim of
   identifying (economically) optimal operational decisions, and it is
   reasonable to expect that significant economic benefits can be derived
   from their integration. Yet, the scheduling and control fields have
   evolved quite independently of each other, and efforts aimed at
   integrating these two decision-making activities are quite recent. In
   this paper, we review progress made thus far in this direction. We
   identify key elements of control and scheduling, and carry out a
   systematic investigation of their use as building blocks for the
   formulation and solution of the integrated scheduling/control problem.
   On the basis of our review, we define several necessary directions for
   future development as well as a complement of promising applications.

   Features}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the proliferation of low-cost digital cameras in mobile
   devices being deployed in automated surveillance networks, we study the
   interaction between perceptual image quality and a classic computer
   vision task of face detection. We quantify the degradation in
   performance of a popular and effective face detector when
   human-perceived image quality is degraded by distortions commonly
   occurring in capture, storage, and transmission of facial images,
   including noise, blur, and compression. It is observed that, within a
   certain range of perceived image quality, a modest increase in image
   quality can drastically improve face detection performance. These
   results can be used to guide resource or bandwidth allocation in
   acquisition or communication/delivery systems that are associated with
   face detection tasks. A new set of features, called qualHOG, are
   proposed for robust facedetection that augments face-indicative
   Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with perceptual
   quality-aware spatial Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) features. Face
   detectors trained on these new features provide statistically
   significant improvement in tolerance to image distortions over a strong
   baseline. Distortiondependent and distortion-unaware variants of the
   face detectors are proposed and evaluated on a large database of face
   images representing a wide range of distortions. A biased variant of the
   training algorithm is also proposed that further enhances the robustness
   of these face detectors. To facilitate this research, we created a new
   distorted face database (DFD), containing face and non-face patches from
   images impaired by a variety of common distortion types and levels. This
   new data set and relevant code are available for download and further
   experimentation at www.live.ece.utexas.edu/research/Quality/index.htm.}},

Abstract = {{Metasurfaces, the two-dimensional equivalent of metamaterials, are
   periodic arrays of sub-wavelength engineered inclusions that can locally

   developments in this area of research, especially focusing on their

Abstract = {{A new class of surfactants has been developed and tested for chemical
   enhanced oil recovery (EOR) that shows excellent performance under harsh
   reservoir conditions. These novel Guerbet alkoxy carboxylate (GAC)
   surfactants fulfill this need by providing large, branched hydrophobes;
   flexibility in the number of alkoxylate groups; and stability in both
   alkaline and nonalkaline environments at temperatures up to at least 120
   degrees C. The new carboxylate surfactants were recently manufactured at
   a cost comparable to other commercial EOR surfactants by use of
   commercially available feedstocks. A formulation containing the
   combination of a carboxylate surfactant and a sulfonate cosurfactant
   resulted in a synergistic interaction that has the potential to reduce
   the total chemical cost further. One can obtain both ultralow
   interfacial tension (IFT) with the oils and a clear aqueous solution
   (even under harsh conditions such as high salinity, high hardness, and
   high temperature with or without alkali) with these new large-hydrophobe
   alkoxy carboxylate surfactants. Both sandstone and carbonate corefloods
   were conducted, with excellent results. Formulations were developed for
   both active oils (contains naturally occurring carboxylic acids) and
   inactive oils (oils that do not produce sufficient amounts of
   soap/carboxylic acid), with excellent results.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper systematically explores the extensional-torsional coupling
   due to the trapeze effect acting on a thin flexible ribbon subjected to
   combined tension and torsion. Kinematic relationships as well as
   expressions for the restoring torque associated with this effect are
   analytically derived. Additionally, the locus of points about which the
   cross sections of a twisted ribbon under tension rotate is derived.
   These points, called torsional centers, are found to be coincident with
   the centroids of the axial stress field at each station along the
   ribbon. More generally, it is shown that when a flexible slender member
   is in tension, combined transverse forces must act at the centroid of
   the axial stress field to produce pure bending and no twist. As a
   result, the elastic axis (EA) of the member shifts from the locus of
   shear centers to the locus of centroids of the axial stress field. A
   numerical model is developed to investigate the effect of the position
   of the EA on the prediction of steady-state deformations and natural
   frequencies of a rotating ribbon with tip mass. By assuming the EA to be
   the locus of the shear centers, the tip twist is overpredicted by a
   factor of 2 for small twist angles, and up to 2.5 for large twist
   deformations. In addition, assuming the EA to be the locus of shear
   centers results in an error of up to 60\% in the predicted natural
   frequencies at large twist angles.}},

Abstract = {{The use of mmWave frequencies for wireless communications offers channel
   bandwidths far greater than previously available, while enabling dozens

   spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and diversity, have been widely
   deployed in lower-frequency systems such as IEEE 802.11n/ac (wireless
   local area networks) and 3GPP LTE 4G cellphone standards. Given the tiny
   wavelengths associated with mmWave, coupled with differences in the
   propagation and antennas used, it is unclear how well spatial
   multiplexing with multiple streams will be suited to future mmWave
   mobile communications. This tutorial explores the fundamental issues
   involved in selecting the best communications approaches for mmWave

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a test program where samples of ASTM
   A992 steel were first subjected to pre-yielding at room temperature, and
   subsequently tested at elevated temperature. Elevated temperature
   properties of previously yielded steel may be of interest for structures
   that experienced a fire following another extreme event that caused
   pre-yielding, such as an earthquake, terrorist attack and normal
   fabrication practices such as a straightening or cambering of members.
   The pre-yielding was simulated with two categories for both 0.5\% and
   8\% as minor and major pre-yielding respectively, to reflect possible
   scenarios as practical industrial issues. The minor pre-yielding is used
   to mimic the potential pre-yielding introduced by normal fabrication
   practices of steel and the major pre-yielding is used to reflect the
   large strain deformations induced from a seismic event or enormous
   deformation due to an unexpected accident. A testing program was
   undertaken by the authors to measure the mechanical properties of ASTM
   A992 steel at elevated temperature after pre-yielding. This paper will
   present results and provide data on the effect of pre-yielding and
   heating process on key mechanical properties, including yield strength,
   tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying two common
   intravascular optical coherence tomography (IV-OCT) artifacts that occur
   when imaging metallic stents: ``merry-go-rounding{''} (MGR), which is an
   increase in strut arc length (SAL), and ``blooming,{''} which is an
   increase in the strut reflection thickness (blooming thickness). Due to
   uncontrollable variables that occur in vivo, we performed an in vitro
   assessment of MGR and blooming in stented vessel phantoms. Using Xience
   V and Driver stents, we examined the effects of catheter offset, intimal
   strut coverage, and residual blood on SAL and blooming thickness in
   IV-OCT images. Catheter offset and strut coverage both caused minor MGR,
   while the greatest MGR effect resulted from light scattering by residual
   blood in the vessel lumen, with 1\% hematocrit (Hct) causing a more than
   fourfold increase in SAL compared with saline (p < 0.001). Residual
   blood also resulted in blooming, with blooming thickness more than
   doubling when imaged in 0.5\% Hct compared with saline (p < 0.001). We
   demonstrate that a previously undescribed mechanism, light scattering by
   residual blood in the imaging field, is the predominant cause of MGR.
   Light scattering also results in blooming, and a newly described
   artifact, three-dimensional-MGR, which results in `` ghost struts{''} in
   B-scans. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{Flexible inorganic electronic devices promise numerous applications,
   especially in fields that could not be covered satisfactorily by
   conventional rigid devices. Benefits on a similar scale are also
   foreseeable for silicon photonic components. However, the difficulty in
   transferring intricate silicon photonic devices has deterred widespread
   development. In this paper, we demonstrate a flexible single-crystal
   silicon nanomembrane photonic crystal microcavity through a bonding and
   substrate removal approach. The transferred cavity shows a quality
   factor of 2.2 x 10(4) and could be bent to a curvature of 5 mm radius
   without deteriorating the performance compared to its counterparts on
   rigid substrates. A thorough characterization of the device reveals that
   the resonant wavelength is a linear function of the bending-induced
   strain. The device also shows a curvature-independent sensitivity to the
   ambient index variation.}},

Abstract = {{Great potential may exist in the development of abalone aquaculture in
   underutilized, exposed marine environments. Abalone is a shellfish that
   feeds on kelp and as a product, can often render high market value. In
   this study, the development of a commercial-size, submersible abalone
   cage grow-out system with a modular box structure is described. The flow
   field characteristics within the abalone containment structure were
   analyzed with computational fluid dynamic software. The hydrodynamic
   response of the moored containment structure was investigated with a
   Morison equation type finite element model that simulates
   fluid-structure interaction. Environmental forcing input to the model
   consisted of loading conditions representing combinations of currents
   with a magnitude of 1.0 m/s and irregular seas with a significant wave
   height of 8.01 m and peak period of 12.52 s. Simulations were performed
   with the abalone cage model in both surface and submerged
   configurations. From the simulations, the attachment loads were
   determined and used in a structural model to calculate local stresses.
   Structural analysis of the deployment and recovery operation was also
   investigated. The results indicate the importance of including a
   combination of detailed structural/hydrodynamic/flow analyses into the
   design framework to avoid catastrophic failures of abalone farming
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Limestone: High-throughput candidate phenotype generation via tensor

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{199-211}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The rapidly increasing availability of electronic health records (EHRs)
   from multiple heterogeneous sources has spearheaded the adoption of
   data-driven approaches for improved clinical research, decision making,
   prognosis, and patient management. Unfortunately. EHR data do not always
   directly and reliably map to medical concepts that clinical researchers
   need or use. Some recent studies have focused on EHR-derived
   phenotyping, which aims at mapping the EHR data to specific medical
   concepts; however, most of these approaches require labor intensive
   supervision from experienced clinical professionals. Furthermore,
   existing approaches are often disease-centric and specialized to the
   idiosyncrasies of the information technology and/or business practices
   of a single healthcare organization.
   In this paper, we propose Limestone, a nonnegative tensor factorization
   method to derive phenotype candidates with virtually no human
   supervision. Limestone represents the data source interactions naturally
   using tensors (a generalization of matrices). In particular, we
   investigate the interaction of diagnoses and medications among patients.
   The resulting tensor factors are reported as phenotype candidates that
   automatically reveal patient clusters on specific diagnoses and
   medications. Using the proposed method, multiple phenotypes can be
   identified simultaneously from data.
   We demonstrate the capability of Limestone on a cohort of 31,815 patient
   records from the Geisinger Health System. The dataset spans 7 years of
   longitudinal patient records and was initially constructed for a heart
   failure onset prediction study. Our experiments demonstrate the
   robustness, stability, and the conciseness of Limestone-derived
   phenotypes. Our results show that using only 40 phenotypes, we can
   outperform the original 640 features (169 diagnosis categories and 471
   medication types) to achieve an area under the receiver operator
   characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.720 (95\% CI 0.715 to 0.725). Moreover,
   in consultation with a medical expert, we confirmed 82\% of the top 50
   candidates automatically extracted by Limestone are clinically
   meaningful. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Enhanced oil recovery from high-temperature, high-salinity naturally
   fractured carbonate reservoirs by surfactant flood}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{122-131}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Water floods are often very inefficient in naturally fractured carbonate
   oil reservoirs because many of these reservoirs are mixed-wet or oil-wet
   as well as extremely heterogeneous. Naturally fractured reservoirs are
   challenging targets for chemical flooding because they typically have a
   high permeability contrast between the fractures and the matrix with a
   low matrix permeability. Some of the world's largest oil reservoirs are
   fractured carbonates with a high reservoir temperature and a high
   salinity formation brine. Some of them also have low API gravity oils,
   which also increases the difficulty of recovering the oil. A surfactant
   formulation has been developed that shows promising results for such
   difficult reservoirs. Ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) and good
   aqueous stability were achieved with this new carboxylate surfactant in
   a hard brine at a high reservoir temperature of 100 degrees C. Both
   static and dynamic imbibition experiments were conducted using a
   fractured carbonate core. 65.9\% Oil recovery was obtained in fractured
   coreflood compared to 33.3\% oil recovery in static imbibition test. The
   surfactant retention was low at 0.086 mg/g of rock. The oil recovery is
   excellent taking into account that the temperature and salinity
   conditions were harsh, the core was extremely vuggy and fractured, no
   mobility control was used, and only a small surfactant slug was
   injected. The coreflood results were interpreted using a mechanistic
   chemical reservoir simulator. It showed that both the mechanisms of IFT
   reduction and wettability alteration were important for oil recovery.
   Neither IFT reduction nor wettability alteration alone recovered oil as
   high as the combined contributions from both. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{2014/2015 represents the tenth anniversary of modern graphene research.
   Over this decade, graphene has proven to be attractive for thin-film
   transistors owing to its remarkable electronic, optical, mechanical and
   thermal properties. Even its major drawback-zero bandgap-has resulted in
   something positive: a resurgence of interest in two-dimensional
   semiconductors, such as dichalcogenides and buckled nanomaterials with
   sizeable bandgaps. With the discovery of hexagonal boron nitride as an
   ideal dielectric, the materials are now in place to advance integrated
   flexible nanoelectronics, which uniquely take advantage of the unmatched
   portfolio of properties of two-dimensional crystals, beyond the
   capability of conventional thin films for ubiquitous flexible systems.}},

Abstract = {{Highly transparent, flexible and conductive networks of carbon
   nanotubes-silver nanowire networks were formed on polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) substrates. The high temperature and humidity tests
   reveal that our CNT-AgNW composite networks maintain high durability and
   reliability in the electrical and optical properties under high
   temperature (85 degrees C) and relative humidity (85\% R.H.). When bent
   and flexed over 1000 cycles; the films did not show significant
   degradation in sheet resistance compared to Ag films and ITOs on the
   same flexible substrates; demonstrating the superior mechanical
   stability of our CNT-AgNWs networks. The composite films on PET were
   employed for supercapacitor electrodes. The supercapacitors demonstrate
   a mass specific capacitance of 143 Fg(-1) with a stable charge-discharge
   (3000 cycles) and low internal resistance (16 Omega). Furthermore; the
   supercapacitors showed high durability under harsh climatic conditions
   and mechanical bending. Our works indicate that the CNT-AgNWs could be
   promising transparent conductive electrodes for the applications in
   flexible optoelectronics and energy storage devices. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH

Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Laminar flow over a periodic array of cylindrical surface roughness
   elements is simulated with an immersed boundary spectral method both to
   validate the method for subsequent studies and to examine how persistent
   streamwise vortices are introduced by a low Reynolds number roughness
   element. Direct comparisons are made with prior studies at a
   roughness-based Reynolds number Re-k (= U(k) k/nu) of 205 and a diameter
   to spanwise spacing ratio d/lambda of 1/3. Downstream velocity contours
   match present and past experiments very well. The shear layer developed
   over the top of the roughness element produces the downstream velocity
   deficit. Upstream of the roughness element, the vortex topology is found
   to be consistent with juncture flow experiments, creating three cores
   along the recirculation line. Streamtraces stemming from these upstream
   cores, however, have unexpectedly little effect on the downstream
   flowfield as lateral divergence of the boundary layer quickly dissipates
   their vorticity. Long physical relaxation time of the recirculating wake
   behind the roughness remains a prominent issue for simulating this type
   of flowfield. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the production potential of shale gas can be assisted by
   constructing a simple, physics-based model for the productivity of
   individual wells. We adopt the simplest plausible physical model:
   one-dimensional pressure diffusion from a cuboid region with the
   effective area of hydrofractures as base and the length of horizontal
   well as height. We formulate a nonlinear initial boundary value problem
   for transient flow of real gas that may sorb on the rock and solve it
   numerically. In principle, solutions of this problem depend on several
   parameters, but in practice within a given gas field, all but two can be
   fixed at typical values, providing a nearly universal curve for which
   only the appropriate scales of time in production and cumulative
   production need to be determined for each well. The scaling curve has
   the property that production rate declines as one over the square root
   of time until the well starts to be pressure depleted, and later it
   declines exponentially. We show that this simple model provides a
   surprisingly accurate description of gas extraction from 8305 horizontal
   wells in the United States' oldest shale play, the Barnett Shale. Good
   agreement exists with the scaling theory for 2133 horizontal wells in
   which production started to decline exponentially in less than 10 yr. We
   provide upper and lower bounds on the time in production and original
   gas in place.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses two fundamental and interrelated issues in
   device-to-device (D2D) enhanced cellular networks. The first issue is
   how D2D users should access spectrum, and we consider two choices:
   overlay (orthogonal spectrum between D2D and cellular UEs) and underlay
   (non-orthogonal). The second issue is how D2D users should choose
   between communicating directly or via the base station, a choice that
   depends on distance between the potential D2D transmitter and receiver.
   We propose a tractable hybrid network model where the positions of
   mobiles are modeled by random spatial Poisson point process, with which
   we present a general analytical approach that allows a unified
   performance evaluation for these questions. Then, we derive analytical
   rate expressions and apply them to optimize the two D2D spectrum sharing
   scenarios under a weighted proportional fair utility function. We find
   that as the proportion of potential D2D mobiles increases, the optimal
   spectrum partition in the overlay is almost invariant (when D2D mode
   selection threshold is large) while the optimal spectrum access factor
   in the underlay decreases. Further, from a coverage perspective, we
   reveal a tradeoff between the spectrum access factor and the D2D mode
   selection threshold in the underlay: as more D2D links are allowed (due
   to a more relaxed mode selection threshold), the network should actually
   make less spectrum available to them to limit their interference.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of MINLP (mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming) approach for scheduling of a CHP (combined heat and power)
   plant in the day-ahead wholesale energy markets. This work employs first
   principles models to describe the nonlinear dynamics of a CHP plant and
   its individual components. The MINLP framework includes practical
   constraints such as minimum/maximum power output and steam flow
   restrictions, minimum up/down times, start-up and shut-down procedures,
   and fuel limits. Special care is given to the explicit modeling of the
   unit start-up types (hot, warm, and cold), which depend on the
   component's prior reservation time, resulting in the differences in the
   time-dependent start-up costs of generating units. The model also
   accounts for the different operating modes (synchronization, soak,
   dispatch, and desynchronization) during start-up and shut-down of each
   unit. We provide case studies involving the Hal C. Weaver power plant
   complex at the University of Texas at Austin to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results show that the
   optimized operating strategies can yield substantial net incomes from

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel test point insertion (TPI) method for a
   pseudo-random built-in self-test (BIST) to reduce the area overhead.
   Recently, a new TPI method for BISTs was proposed that tries to use
   functional flip-flops to drive control test points instead of adding
   extra dedicated flip-flops for driving control points. The replacement
   rule used in a previous work has limitations preventing some dedicated
   flip-flops from being replaced by functional flip-flops. This paper
   proposes a logic cone analysis based TPI approach to overcome the
   limitations. Logic cone analysis is performed to find candidate
   functional flop-flops for replacing dedicated flip-flops. Experimental
   results indicate that the proposed method reduces the test point area
   overhead significantly with minimal loss of testability by replacing the
   dedicated flip-flops.}},

Abstract = {{We announce a new video quality model (VQM) that accounts for the
   perceptual impact of variable frame delays (VFD) in videos with
   demonstrated top performance on the laboratory for image and video
   engineering (LIVE) mobile video quality assessment (VQA) database. This
   model, called VQM\_VFD, uses perceptual features extracted from
   spatial-temporal blocks spanning fixed angular extents and a long edge
   detection filter. VQM\_VFD predicts video quality by measuring multiple
   frame delays using perception based parameters to track subjective
   quality over time. In the performance analysis of VQM\_VFD, we evaluated
   its efficacy at predicting human opinions of visual quality. A detailed
   correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing show that
   VQM\_VFD accurately predicts human subjective judgments and
   substantially outperforms top-performing image quality assessment and
   VQA models previously tested on the LIVE mobile VQA database. VQM\_VFD
   achieved the best performance on the mobile and tablet studies of the
   LIVE mobile VQA database for simulated compression, wireless
   packet-loss, and rate adaptation, but not for temporal dynamics. These
   results validate the new model and warrant a hard release of the VQM\_
   VFD algorithm. It is freely available for any purpose, commercial, or

Abstract = {{Broadband impedance matching and zero reflection of acoustic waves at a
   planar interface between two natural materials is a rare phenomenon,
   unlike its optical counterpart, frequently observed for polarized light
   incident at the Brewster angle. In this article, it is shown that, by
   inserting a metamaterial layer between two acoustic materials with
   different impedance, it is possible to artificially realize an extremely
   broadband Brewster-like acoustic intromission angle window, in which
   energy is totally transmitted from one natural medium to the other. The
   metamaterial buffer, composed of acoustically hard materials with
   subwavelength tapered apertures, provides an interesting way to match
   the impedances of two media in a broadband fashion, different from
   traditional methods like quarter-wave matching or Fabry-Perot
   resonances, inherently narrowband due to their resonant nature. This
   phenomenon may be interesting for a variety of applications including
   energy harvesting, acoustic imaging, ultrasonic transducer technology,

Abstract = {{Traditional steel connection systems rely on on-site welding and

   Reducing welding and bolting efforts in structural steel erection
   presents an opportunity to improve steel structure construction
   productivity. A series of steel quick connection systems (SQCS) have
   been introduced in the market in the last few years, either through
   research prototypes or commercial products. However, their real benefits
   need to be confirmed and quantified at actual construction sites. Hence,
   the main goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of steel quick
   connection systems on construction productivity and cost. To accomplish
   this goal, the authors performed analyses of data from nine SQCS
   projects and conducted two case studies. The authors also utilized a
   building information modeling based simulation to compare the schedule
   impact of SQCS and conventional structural steel connections systems.

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Non-reciprocal components, which are essential to many modern
   communication systems, are almost exclusively based on magneto-optical
   materials, severely limiting their applicability. A practical and
   inexpensive route to magnetic-free non-reciprocity could revolutionize
   radio-frequency and nanophotonic communication networks.
   Angular-momentum biasing was recently proposed as a means of realizing
   isolation for sound waves travelling in a rotating medium(1), and
   envisaged as a path towards compact, linear integrated non-reciprocal
   electromagnetic components(2),(3). Inspired by this concept, here we
   demonstrate a subwavelength, linear radio-frequency non-reciprocal
   circulator free from magnetic materials and bias. The scheme is based on
   the parametric modulation of three identical, strongly and symmetrically
   coupled resonators. Their resonant frequencies are modulated by external
   signals with the same amplitude and a relative phase difference of 120
   degrees, imparting an effective electronic angular momentum to the
   system. We observe giant non-reciprocity, with up to six orders of
   magnitude difference in transmission for opposite directions.
   Furthermore, the device topology is tunable in real time, and can be
   directly embedded in a conventional integrated circuit.}},

Title = {{Computational study of the interaction of cold atmospheric helium plasma
   jets with surfaces}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We describe a computational modeling study of a cold atmospheric
   pressure plasma jet interacting with a dielectric surface placed normal
   to the jet axis. The plasma jet is generated by the application of a
   nanosecond pulse voltage applied to a dielectric tube through which the
   jet issues into ambient air. A base fluid flow field is pre-computed
   using a Navier-Stokes model for the helium jet impinging on the
   dielectric target surface with a two-species description for laminar
   diffusional mixing of the helium and ambient air streams. A
   self-consistent, multiple species, two-temperature model is used to
   describe the non-equilibrium plasma discharge dynamics in the presence
   of the base jet flow field. A single nanosecond pulse discharge event
   starting from initial breakdown in the dielectric tube, to propagation
   into the open gap, and finally the interaction with the dielectric
   surface is simulated. Initially, the plasma forms within the dielectric
   tube and propagates along the tube surface as a surface discharge driven
   by large induced electric fields produced by trapped charge on the
   dielectric surface. When the discharge reaches the end of the dielectric
   tube, the discharge transitions to a constricted fast ionization wave
   that propagates along the helium-air interface. The fast ionization wave
   eventually reaches the dielectric target surface where charged species
   are deposited as the discharge propagates parallel to the wall as a
   surface driven discharge. The surface driven discharge ceases to
   propagate once the quantity of air to helium is sufficient enough to
   quench the hot electrons and prevent further ionization. Due to the low
   speed of the flow discharge and the short life times of the radical
   species such as O, most of the radical species delivered to the surface
   are a result of the surface discharge that forms after the plasma bullet
   impinges against the surface. It is found that factors such as the
   thickness of the target dielectric and the profile of the stagnation
   helium-air jet significantly impact the net quantity of reactive
   particles delivered to the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal denaturation of proteins is critical to cell injury, food
   science and other biomaterial processing. For example protein
   denaturation correlates strongly with cell death by heating, and is
   increasingly of interest in focal thermal therapies of cancer and other
   diseases at temperatures which often exceed 50 A degrees C. The
   Arrhenius model is a simple yet widely used model for both protein
   denaturation and cell injury. To establish the utility of the Arrhenius
   model for protein denaturation at 50 A degrees C and above its
   sensitivities to the kinetic parameters (activation energy E (a) and
   frequency factor A) were carefully examined. We propose a simplified
   correlated parameter fit to the Arrhenius model by treating E (a), as an
   independent fitting parameter and allowing A to follow dependently. The
   utility of the correlated parameter fit is demonstrated on thermal
   denaturation of proteins and cells from the literature as a validation,
   and new experimental measurements in our lab using FTIR spectroscopy to
   demonstrate broad applicability of this method. Finally, we demonstrate
   that the end-temperature within which the denaturation is measured is
   important and changes the kinetics. Specifically, higher E (a) and A
   parameters were found at low end-temperature (50 A degrees C) and reduce
   as end-temperatures increase to 70 A degrees C. This trend is consistent
   with Arrhenius parameters for cell injury in the literature that are
   significantly higher for clonogenics (45-50 A degrees C) vs. membrane
   dye assays (60-70 A degrees C). Future opportunities to monitor cell
   injury by spectroscopic measurement of protein denaturation are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Right ventricular (RV) failure in response to pulmonary hypertension
   (PH) is a severe disease that remains poorly understood. PH-induced
   pressure overload leads to changes in the RV free wall (RVFW) that
   eventually results in RV failure. While the development of computational
   models can benefit our understanding of the onset and progression of
   PH-induced pressure overload, detailed knowledge of the underlying
   structural and biomechanical events remains limited. The goal of the
   present study was to elucidate the structural and biomechanical
   adaptations of RV myocardium subjected to sustained pressure overload in
   a rat model. Hemodynamically confirmed severe chronic RV pressure
   overload was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats via pulmonary artery
   banding. Extensive tissue-level biaxial mechanical and
   histomorphological analyses were conducted to assess the remodeling
   response in the RV free wall. Simultaneous myofiber hypertrophy and
   longitudinal re-orientation of myo- and collagen fibers were observed,
   with both fiber types becoming more highly aligned. Transmural myo- and
   collagen fiber orientations were co-aligned in both the normal and
   diseased state. The overall tissue stiffness increased, with larger
   increases in longitudinal vs. circumferential stiffness. The latter was
   attributed to longitudinal fiber re-orientation, which increased the
   degree of anisotropy. Increased mechanical coupling between the two axes
   was attributed to the increased fiber alignment. Interestingly,
   estimated myofiber stiffness increased while the collagen fiber
   stiffness remained unchanged. The increased myofiber stiffness was
   consistent with clinical results showing titin-associated increased
   sarcomeric stiffening observed in PH patients. These results further our
   understanding of the underlying adaptive and maladaptive remodeling
   mechanisms and may lead to improved techniques for prognosis, diagnosis,
   and treatment for PH.}},

Abstract = {{Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations and the major heat carriers in
   most crystalline materials. We have been utilizing femtosecond phonon
   spectroscopy to excite and detect optical coherent phonons (CPs) in
   various materials. However, the impact of CPs to overall thermal
   transport is still unknown. In this study, we developed a small
   perturbation model in MD to simulate CPs and investigate the effects of
   CPs on thermal transport in Bi2Te3 at temperatures ranging from 20 to
   325 K. The phonon frequency and lifetime predicted by our model agree
   very well with experimental results. It is found that the effective
   thermal transport estimated with the heat current autocorrelation
   function shows a great enhancement upon CP generation and extension,
   especially at low temperatures. Our results suggest that it is possible
   to manipulate thermal transport effectively with CPs.}},

Abstract = {{Electromigration (EM) in power distribution networks (PDNs) is a major
   reliability issue in 3-D ICs. While the EM issues of local vias and
   through-silicon-vias (TSV) have been studied separately, the interplay
   of TSVs and conventional local vias in 3-D ICs has not been well
   investigated. This co-design is necessary when the die-to-die vertical
   power delivery is done using both TSVs and local interconnects. In this
   paper, we model EM for PDNs of 3-D ICs with a focus on multiscale via
   (MSV) structure, i.e., TSVs and local vias used together for vertical
   power delivery. We study the impact of structure, material, and
   preexisting void conditions on the EM-related lifetime of our MSV
   structures. We also investigate the transient IR-voltage change of
   full-chip level 3-D PDNs with MSVs with our model. The experimental
   results demonstrate that our EM modeling can effectively capture the EM
   reliability of the full-chip level 3-D PDNs with MSVs, which can be hard
   to achieve by the traditional EM analysis based on the individual local
   via or the TSV.}},

Title = {{Cost of Right-of-Way Acquisition: Recognizing the Impact of Condemnation
   via a Switching Regression Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The costs of acquiring parcels by condemnation are usually significantly
   higher than those of property acquired by negotiation, suggesting that
   right-of-way (R/W) acquisition costs may best be described by two
   different regression equations. This paper develops a switching
   regression model of acquisition cost to simultaneously predict the
   probability of whether a parcel will go to condemnation rather than be
   acquired through negotiation and the corresponding acquisition costs
   under these two regimes. The error terms of the selection equation and
   the two cost equations follow a trivariate normal distribution to
   reflect codependence on unobserved factors (such as a land owner's
   tenacity or a site's view value). When applied to the properties
   acquired across the state of Texas for transportation probjects between
   2008 and 2011, the results of this switching regression model suggest
   that R/W appraisers and staff should pay special attention to parcels in
   commercial use involving a partial taking with a relatively small
   remainder and located in more urbanized areas. Comparison of cost
   estimates between the two regimes (condemnation versus negotiation)
   suggests that condemned parcels will have, on average, 78\% higher
   acquisition costs and 51\% greater price variation across the 1,710
   acquired properties. These results suggest that it is much more costly
   to acquire a property and more difficult to accurately predict its costs
   if it cannot be acquired through negotiation. The application of model
   estimates to an example corridor highlights the value of simulation to
   capture all modeling uncertainties. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron
   microscopy studies were conducted in situ on 2-5 nm Pt and 10-40 nm Ag
   nanoparticles to study mechanisms for sintering and to measure relevant
   sintering kinetics in nanoscale particles. Sintering between two
   separated particles was observed to initiate by either (1) diffusion of
   the particles on the sample support or (2) diffusion of atoms or small
   clusters of atoms to the neck region between the two particles. After
   particle contact, the rate of sintering was controlled by atomic surface
   diffusivity. The surface diffusivity was determined as a function of
   particle size and temperature from experimental measurements of the rate
   of neck growth of the particles. The surface diffusivities did not show
   a strong size effect for the range of particle sizes that were studied.
   The surface diffusivity for Pt nanoparticles exhibited the expected
   Arrhenius temperature dependence and did not appear to be sensitive to
   the presence of surface contaminants. In contrast, the surface
   diffusivity for Ag nanoparticles was affected by the presence of
   impurities such as carbon. The diffusivities for Ag nanoparticles were
   consistent with previous measurements of bulk surface diffusivities for
   Ag in the presence of C, but were significantly slower than those
   obtained from pristine Ag. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

   systems. Equation-oriented (EO) steady-state process simulation and
   optimization are key enablers in the optimal design of integrated
   processes. A new process modeling and simulation concept based on
   pseudo-transient continuation is introduced. An algorithm for
   reformulating the steady-state models of process unit operations as
   differential-algebraic equation systems that are statically equivalent
   with the original model is presented. These pseudo-transient models
   improve the convergence of EO process flowsheet simulations by expanding
   the convergence basin. This concept is used to build a library of
   pseudo-transient models for common process unit operations, and this
   modeling concept seamlessly integrates with a previously developed
   time-relaxation optimization algorithm. Two design case studies are
   presented to validate the proposed framework. (c) 2014 American

Abstract = {{One of the largest user of electricity in the average U.S. household is
   appliances, which when aggregated, account for approximately 30\% of
   electricity used in the residential building sector. As influencing the
   time-of-use of energy becomes increasingly important to control the
   stress on today's electrical grid infrastructure, understanding when
   appliances use energy and what causes variation in their use are of
   great importance. However, there is limited appliance-specific data
   available to understand their use patterns. This study provides daily
   energy use profiles of four major household appliances: refrigerator,
   clothes washer, clothes dryer, and dishwasher, through analyzing
   disaggregated energy use data collected for 40 single family homes in
   Austin, TX. The results show that when compared to those assumed in
   current energy simulation software for residential buildings, the
   averaged appliance load profiles have similar daily distributions.
   Refrigerators showed the most constant and consistent use. However, the
   three user-dependent appliances, appliances which depend on users to
   initiate use, varied more greatly between houses and by time-of-day.
   During peak use times, on weekends, and in homes with household members
   working at home, the daily use profiles of appliances were less
   consistent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The tremendous explosion of image-, video-, and audio-enabled mobile
   devices, such as tablets and smart-phones in recent years, has led to an
   associated dramatic increase in the volume of captured and distributed
   multimedia content. In particular, the number of digital photographs
   being captured annually is approaching 100 billion in just the U. S.
   These pictures are increasingly being acquired by inexperienced, casual
   users under highly diverse conditions leading to a plethora of
   distortions, including blur induced by camera shake. In order to be able
   to automatically detect, correct, or cull images impaired by
   shake-induced blur, it is necessary to develop distortion models
   specific to and suitable for assessing the sharpness of camera-shaken
   images. Toward this goal, we have developed a no-reference framework for
   automatically predicting the perceptual quality of camera-shaken images
   based on their spectral statistics. Two kinds of features are defined
   that capture blur induced by camera shake. One is a directional feature,
   which measures the variation of the image spectrum across orientations.
   The second feature captures the shape, area, and orientation of the
   spectral contours of camera shaken images. We demonstrate the
   performance of an algorithm derived from these features on new and
   existing databases of images distorted by camera shake.}},

   Valve Tissue Formation Under Pulmonary Arterial Physiological Flow

Abstract = {{The ability to replicate physiological hemodynamic conditions during in
   vitro tissue development has been recognized as an important aspect in
   the development and in vitro assessment of engineered heart valve
   tissues. Moreover, we have demonstrated that studies aiming to
   understand mechanical conditioning require separation of the major heart
   valve deformation loading modes: flow, stretch, and flexure (FSF) (Sacks
   et al., 2009, ``Bioengineering Challenges for Heart Valve Tissue
   Engineering,{''} Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng., 11(1), pp. 289-313). To
   achieve these goals in a novel bioreactor design, we utilized a
   cylindrical conduit configuration for the conditioning chamber to allow
   for higher fluid velocities, translating to higher shear stresses on the
   in situ tissue specimens while retaining laminar flow conditions. Moving
   boundary computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed to
   predict the flow field under combined cyclic flexure and steady flow
   (cyclic-flex-flow) states using various combinations of flow rate, and
   media viscosity. The device was successfully constructed and tested for
   incubator housing, gas exchange, and sterility. In addition, we
   performed a pilot experiment using biodegradable polymer scaffolds
   seeded with bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) at a seeding density
   of 5 x 10(6) cells/cm(2). The constructs were subjected to combined
   cyclic flexure (1 Hz frequency) and steady flow (Re = 1376; flow rate of
   1.06 l/min (LPM); shear stress in the range of 0-9 dynes/cm(2)) for 2
   weeks to permit physiological shear stress conditions. Assays revealed
   significantly (P < 0.05) higher amounts of collagen (20516256 mu g/g) at
   the end of 2 weeks in comparison to similar experiments previously
   conducted in our laboratory but performed at subphysiological levels of
   shear stress (<2 dynes/cm(2); Engelmayr et al., 2006, ``Cyclic Flexure
   and Laminar Flow Synergistically Accelerate Mesenchymal Stem
   Cell-Mediated Engineered Tissue Formation: Implications for Engineered
   Heart Valve Tissues,{''} Biomaterials, 27(36), pp. 6083-6095). The
   implications of this novel design are that fully coupled or decoupled
   physiological flow, flexure, and stretch modes of engineered tissue
   conditioning investigations can be readily accomplished with the
   inclusion of this device in experimental protocols on engineered heart
   valve tissue formation.}},

Title = {{Automatic Reasoning for Defining Lathe Operations for Mill-Turn Parts: A
   Tolerance Based Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With the increase in computer-controlled hybrid machining (e. g.,
   mill-turn machining), one needs to discern what features of a part are
   created during turning (i.e., with a lathe cutter) versus those created
   by milling. Given a generic part, it is desirable to extract the
   turnable and nonturnable features in order to obtain feasible machining
   plans. A novel approach for automating this division and for defining
   the resulting turning operations in a hybrid process is proposed in this
   paper. Given a mill-turn part, the algorithm first identifies the
   dominant rotational-axis in order to quickly generate the axisymmetric
   ``aslathed{''} model. This model is then subtracted from the original
   part to isolate the nonturnable features. Next, the as-lathed model is
   translated to a label-rich graph, which is fed into a grammar reasoning
   algorithm to produce feasible turning sequences. During the turning
   process planning, the knowledge encapsulated in the design tolerances is
   used to guide the generation of feasible turning sequences. Two case
   studies are provided to explain the details of our algorithm. One of the
   suggested turning plans is compared with a manually proposed plan from
   an expert machinist and the results show the optimality of our plan in
   satisfying the prescribed tolerances.}},

Abstract = {{Transportation investments are nearing \$1,000per capita annually in the
   USA, and the Highway Trust Fund has been depleted. Such significant
   investments and budget-constrained contexts demand careful
   decision-making and thoughtful cost-benefit analyses. A project
   evaluation toolkit has been developed for comprehensive assessment of
   network expansion and pricing projects with only project expenditures,
   link attributes, and traffic counts as required inputs. The toolkit uses
   a self-contained travel demand model to predict future and alternative
   scenario traffic volumes, speeds, crash counts, emissions, and toll
   revenues while providing project-summary measures, including net present
   value and benefit-cost ratios. The toolkit seeks to provide early
   assessment of major project plans along abstracted networks, using
   hundreds of coded links (rather than thousands), providing results in a
   matter of minutes (rather than days). This paper describes the model and
   develops two case-study sites, each with several alternative scenarios.
   The first examines capacity expansion projects along a highly congested
   link on the periphery of Austin, Texas, while the second focuses on
   strategies to reduce traffic in central Austin through tolling and
   capacity-reduction projects. Toolkit results show which projects merit
   further consideration by summarizing and monetizing impacts across
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The gyroscope is playing a key role in helping estimate 3D camera
   rotation for various vision applications on cell phones, including video
   stabilization and feature tracking. Successful fusion of gyroscope and
   camera data requires that the camera, gyroscope, and their relative pose
   to be calibrated. In addition, the timestamps of gyroscope readings and
   video frames are usually not well synchronized. Previous paper performed
   camera-gyroscope calibration and synchronization offline after the
   entire video sequence has been captured with restrictions on the camera
   motion, which is unnecessarily restrictive for everyday users to run
   apps that directly use the gyroscope. In this paper, we propose an
   online method that estimates all the necessary parameters, whereas a
   user is capturing video. Our contributions are: 1) simultaneous online
   camera self-calibration and camera-gyroscope calibration based on an
   implicit extended Kalman filter and 2) generalization of the
   multiple-view coplanarity constraint on camera rotation in a rolling
   shutter camera model for cell phones. The proposed method is able to
   estimate the needed calibration and synchronization parameters online
   with all kinds of camera motion and can be embedded in gyroaided
   applications, such as video stabilization and feature tracking. Both
   Monte Carlo simulation and cell phone experiments show that the proposed
   online calibration and synchronization method converge fast to the
   ground truth values.}},

Abstract = {{Metastatic melanoma is a deadly form of cancer with few therapeutic
   options and the cause of more than 9480 deaths annually in the USA
   alone. Novel treatment options for this disease are urgently needed.
   Here we test the efficacy of a novel melanoma drug, the human
   recombinant Co-arginase (CoArgIPEG), against an aggressive A375 melanoma
   mouse model. CoArgIPEG is a modification of the naturally occurring
   human enzyme with improved stability, catalytic activity, and
   potentially lower immunogenicity compared with current amino
   acid-depleting drugs. Marked tumor growth reductions (mean P=0.0057)
   with apoptosis induction and proliferation inhibition are noted with
   CoArgIPEG treatment, both in the presence and in the absence of
   supplemental citrulline. Further, improved therapeutic efficacy has been
   noted against A375 xenografts relative to the naturally occurring human
   recombinant arginase enzyme at lower doses of CoArgIPEG. Unfortunately,
   after 1 month, half of the relapsing tumors showed argininosuccinate
   synthase induction, which correlated with Ser62-phosphorylated cMyc.
   Although argininosuccinate synthase induction could not be induced in
   vitro, a drug targeting pathway previously demonstrated to be associated
   with Ser62 cMyc phosphorylation - U0126 - in combination with CoArgIPEG
   demonstrated an in-vitro synergistic response (combination indices 0.13
   +/- 0.10 and 0.14 +/- 0.10 with or without citrulline, respectively).
   Overall, favorable efficacy and potential synergy with other
   antimelanoma drugs support CoArgIPEG as a potent, novel cancer
   therapeutic.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{282}},
Pages = {{54-70}},

Abstract = {{A new eddy viscosity model for the large eddy simulation of turbulent
   flows is developed. The eddy viscosity is proportional to the product of
   the magnitude of the fine scale velocity and the grid size. The residual
   based variational multiscale formulation is used to obtain a
   computationally inexpensive approximation for the fine scale velocity
   field. It is noted that the fine scale velocity field, and hence the
   eddy viscosity, are proportional to the residual of the resolved scale
   solution. As a result the eddy viscosity automatically vanishes whenever
   or wherever the coarse scale solution is accurate. In that regard this
   model is inherently dynamic and does not require the application of a
   dynamic procedure. The performance of this model is tested in predicting
   the decay of incompressible and compressible homogeneous turbulence. In
   both cases it is found that it is more accurate than the dynamic version
   of the Smagorinsky-type eddy viscosity model. In addition, it is easier
   to implement as it does not require a dynamic procedure in order to
   determine model parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of staffing large-scale service systems with

   which arrival rates are deterministic and the QoS metric is the
   probability a customer is queued, given by the Erlang-C formula. We use
   the Janssen-Van Leeuwaarden-Zwart bounds to obtain asymptotically
   optimal solutions to this problem. The second model considered is one in
   which the arrival rates are not completely known in advance (before the
   server staffing levels are chosen), but rather are known via a
   probability distribution. In this case, we provide asymptotically
   optimal solutions to the resulting stochastic integer program,
   leveraging results obtained for the case of deterministic arrivals.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{79}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (WSGG) model is widely used in
   engineering computations of radiative heat transfer in participating
   media due to its relatively simple implementation and reasonable
   accuracy. However, a major difficulty arises with its application to
   general gas mixtures where the mole ratios of the participating
   components are not constant. The present study presents a WSGG
   methodology to allow efficient, accurate computation of radiative heat
   transfer in mixtures of H2O, CO2, and soot with arbitrary
   concentrations. The method is based on first establishing independent
   correlations for each species, which are then combined to form the WSGG
   correlations for the mixture. A few test cases are presented to assess
   the accuracy of the two methods by comparisons with benchmark solutions
   obtained with the line-by-line integration (LBL) of the spectrum. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flow past a cylinder is a classical problem of fluid mechanics and
   convective heat transfer. In this problem, the local convective heat
   transfer coefficient on the cylinder surface varies around the cylinder
   due to boundary layer growth, separation and transition to turbulence.
   While there is considerable literature on computing the temperature
   distribution in the fluid, not much work exists on computing the
   temperature distribution within the solid body, particularly if the
   solid has anisotropic thermal properties. This paper presents an
   analytical technique for computing the temperature distribution within a
   heat-generating cylinder with anisotropic thermal conductivity subjected
   to spatially varying convective heat transfer coefficient due to fluid
   flow. As expected, temperature distribution on the cylinder surface
   exhibits minima and maxima at locations where the convective heat
   transfer coefficient has maxima and minima respectively. The effect of
   various parameters, including Reynolds number of the flow and extent of
   anisotropy are examined. Results presented in this paper contribute
   towards the fundamental understanding of a classical heat transfer
   problem. Further, since Li-ion cells that are commonly used for energy
   conversion and storage exhibit strong thermal conduction anisotropy,
   these results may be useful for design of convection-based thermal
   management of Li-ion cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes a control system designed for real-time monitoring

   To provide information for real-time monitoring of damage, indirect
   measurement of damage is made feasible using an embedded carbon nanotube
   (CNT) network to perform as sensor for detecting the local damage. A
   software infrastructure is developed and implemented in order to
   integrate the various constituents, such as finite element approximation
   of the continuum damage models, generated experimental data, and
   Bayesian-based methods for model calibration and validation. The

Abstract = {{This report describes the direct melt processing of inorganic tin
   fluorophosphate (TFP) glass fibers with average diameters ranging from 2
   to 4 A mu m via centrifugal Forcespinning. This was accomplished by
   using a TFP glass with low glass transition temperature (T (g)) and the
   melt processing capability of Forcespinning. The thermal behavior of TFP
   glass fibers was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and
   thermogravimetric analysis, while the compositional evolution of the
   fibers was studied using energy-dispersive spectrometry and
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. These fibers exhibited
   excellent thermal stability after thermal post-treatment at 300 A
   degrees C. The T (g) of the thermally treated fibers increased by 100 A
   degrees C compared to the bulk material. The fibers were found to
   undergo dehydration and loss of fluorine during thermal treatment,
   resulting in a rigid and crosslinked glass network with enhanced thermal
   stability and increased T (g). The enhanced thermal stability
   demonstrated the potential of TFP fibers for high temperature catalysis
   and chemical filtration applications.}},

Abstract = {{The base of the methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) in the Kumano
   Basin, offshore Japan, is marked by a bottom-simulating reflection (BSR)
   on seismic data. At Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0002, which
   penetrates this BSR, the in situ temperature profile combined with bulk
   seawater methane equilibrium conditions suggest that the base of the
   MHSZ is 428 m below seafloor (bsf), which is 28m deeper than the
   observed BSR (400 m bsf). We found that submicron pore sizes determined
   by mercury injection capillary pressure are sufficiently small to cause
   64\% of the observed uplift of the base of the MHSZ by the Gibbs-Thomson
   effect. This is the most thorough characterization of pore sizes within
   the MHSZ performed to date and illustrates the extent to which pore size
   can influence MHSZ thickness. Our results demonstrate the importance of
   considering lithology and pore structure when assessing methane hydrate
   stability conditions in marine sediments.}},

Abstract = {{For 68 fluids that include hydrogen bonding and quantum fluids, the
   fugacity coefficient that defines the residual chemical potential adopts
   a near universal value of 2/3 at the critical point. More precisely, the
   reciprocal of the fugacity coefficient equals 1.52 +/- 0.02 and includes
   fluids as diverse as helium (1.50), dodecafluoropentane (1.50), and
   water (1.53). For 65 classical fluids, a dimensionless thermal pressure
   coefficient and internal pressure attain critical values of 1.88 +/-
   0.11 and 1.61 +/- 0.11, respectively. From equations of state, values of
   these new critical constants have been calculated and agree favorably
   with experimental values. Specifically, for the critical fugacity
   coefficient, the following results were obtained for its reciprocal: van
   der Waals (1.44), lattice gas (1.43), scaled particle theory (1.46), and
   the RedlichKwong eq (1.50). The semiempirical RedlichKwong equation is
   also the most accurate for the thermal pressure coefficient (1.86) and
   internal pressure (1.53). Physical interpretations of these results are
   discussed as well as their implications for other critical phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the influence of metal ions and oxidative
   degradation inhibitors on the stability of monoethanolamine solvents
   (MEA) is studied. Solvent degradation induces additional costs and
   impacts the environmental balance of the CO2 capture process as well as
   its efficiency. The two main degradation pathways of MEA are studied
   under accelerated conditions: oxidative degradation with continuous gas
   feed and thermal degradation in batch reactors. It is confirmed that
   metal ions (resulting from solvent impurities and wall leaching) enhance
   the oxidative degradation of MEA, while they do not impact its thermal
   degradation. Moreover, different oxidative degradation inhibitors are
   tested with varying results according to the inhibitor. It appears that
   at the selected concentration, radical scavengers like Inhibitor A and
   DMTD (2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) are more efficient than
   chelating agents like HEDP (1-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid) at
   inhibiting oxidative degradation. Furthermore, attention must be paid to
   the influence of oxidative degradation inhibitors on the thermal
   degradation of MEA. Indeed, some inhibitors like DMTD, DTPA
   (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), and DTDP (3,3'-dithiodipropionic
   acid) appeared to decrease the MEA thermal stability, which cannot be
   accepted in industrial applications. Finally, a further drawback of DTPA
   is its high affinity for metal ions, leading to a more corrosive
   solution, so its use is not recommended for CO2 capture applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we generalize our previous results concerning the impact
   of material recycling and energy recovery on plant dynamics and control.
   We define a generic class of integrated process systems, in which an
   extensive quantity that obeys conservation laws is recovered from the
   process output and recycled to the process feed; the operation of the
   system is assumed to be subject to time-varying, measurable
   disturbances. We establish, in this general case, that integration is
   conducive to the emergence of a two-time-scale dynamic behavior and
   derive reduced-order models for the dynamics in each time scale.
   Subsequently, we postulate a hierarchical control framework that
   exploits these dynamics results in the design of coordinated fast and
   slow feedback/feedforward controllers and formulate a stability result
   for the closed-loop system. We demonstrate these concepts on a case
   study concerning an energy-integrated process. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Abstract = {{Natural materials exhibit negligible magnetism at optical frequencies,
   since the direct effects of the optical magnetic field on matter are
   much weaker than electric ones. In the last decades, however, scientists
   and engineers have been trying to tackle and overcome these limitations
   by designing artificial subwavelength meta-molecules that support a
   strong magnetic response, even if made of non-magnetic materials. These
   issues have become popular because of the excitement around magnetic
   metamaterials and their exotic wave interaction. Here, we review recent
   efforts on this topic, with particular focus on magnetic metamaterials
   operating at optical frequencies. We discuss how the concept of
   split-ring resonators, introduced at microwaves to realize artificial
   magnetic inclusions with subwavelength footprint, can be translated to
   the optical region exploiting the plasmonic features of metallic
   nanoparticles suitably arranged in nanoclusters and nanorings. We also
   show that Fano interference effects, triggered by small
   symmetry-breaking in nanoclusters, may be the key to largely boost the
   magnetic response in optical metamolecules. All these findings show that
   the alliance of optical metamaterials and advanced nanotechnology holds
   the promise to provide significant advances in the quest towards
   low-loss optical magnetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of most therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting
   tumor antigens results primarily from their ability to elicit potent
   cytotoxicity through effectormediated functions. We have engineered the
   fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) mAb,
   HuM195, targeting the leukemic antigen CD33, by introducing the triple
   mutation Ser293Asp/Ala330Leuille332Glu (DLE), and developed Time-lapse
   Imaging Microscopy in Nanowell Grids to analyze antibody-dependent
   cellmediated cytotoxicity kinetics of thousands of individual natural
   killer (NK) cells and mAb-coated target cells. We demonstrate that the
   DLE-HuM195 antibody increases both the quality and the quantity of NK
   cell-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity by endowing more NK cells
   to participate in cytotoxicity via accrued CD16-mediated signaling and
   by increasing serial killing of target cells. NK cells encountering
   targets coated with DLE-HuM195 induce rapid target cell apoptosis by
   promoting simultaneous conjugates to multiple target cells and induce
   apoptosis in twice the number of target cells within the same period as
   the wild-type mAb. Enhanced target killing was also associated with
   increased frequency of NK cells undergoing apoptosis, but this effect
   was donor-dependent. Antibody-based therapies targeting tumor antigens
   will benefit from a better understanding of cell-mediated tumor
   elimination, and our work opens further opportunities for the
   therapeutic targeting of CD33 in the treatment of acute myeloid
   leukemia.}},

   is to use alternative, high-capacity, lithium-free anodes (e.g., Si, Sn,

   identified on the initial charge of insulating bulk Li2S particles,
   limiting the cell performance. In this work, the bulk Li2S particles
   were effectively activated with an electrolyte containing P2S5,
   resulting in a lowered initial charging voltage plateau. This permits
   the direct use of commercially available bulk Li2S particles as a

   degrees C. Especially, the Y(0.5)in(0.1)Ca(0.4)BaCo(3)ZnO(7+delta) + GDC
   composite cathode exhibits good performance on GDC electrolytes in the
   range of 400-600 degrees C. With superior phase stability and
   electrochemical performance, the (Y,In,Ca)BaCo3ZnO7+delta series of
   oxides are attractive cathode candidates for intermediate temperature

Abstract = {{We report a simple and efficient extracellular biosynthesis of silver
   and gold nanoparticles (Ag and AuNPs) using anaerobic enriched mixed
   bacteria (AEMB) for the first time. Biosynthesized silver and gold
   nanoparticles were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), Xray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results demonstrated that as-prepared
   nanoparticles are spherical in shape with the size of 5-65 nm in range.
   For gold nanopartides, 2-7 particles were self-assembled into 1D
   chain-like structure. FTIR results evidenced interaction between the
   nanoparticle's surface and the reductive groups. Additionally, the
   dominant bacterial species in the enriched mixed culture have been
   identified via PCR-DGGE and DNA sequencing analysis. It was found that
   major bands belong to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus
   amylotrophicious and Salmonella enterica, which were responsible for the
   rapid reduction of silver and gold nanoparticles. This simple and green
   protocol could be used to prepare large-scale and economically viable
   synthesis of other metallic nanoparticles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multimodal nanostructures can help solve many problems in the biomedical
   field including sensitive molecular imaging, highly specific therapy,
   and early cancer detection. However, the synthesis of densely packed,
   multicomponent nanostructures with multimodal functionality represents a
   significant challenge. Here, a new type of hybrid magneto-plasmonic
   nanoparticles is developed using an oil-in-water microemulsion method.
   The nanostructures are synthetized by self-assembly of primary 6 nm iron
   oxide core-gold shell particles resulting into densely packed spherical
   nanoclusters. The dense packing of primary particles does not change
   their superparamagnetic behavior; however, the close proximity of the
   constituent particles in the nanocluster leads to strong near-infrared
   (NIR) plasmon resonances. The synthesis is optimized to eliminate
   nanocluster cytotoxicity. Immunotargeted nanoclusters are also developed
   using directional conjugation chemistry through the Fc antibody moiety,
   leaving the Fab antigen recognizing region available for targeting.
   Cancer cells labeled with immunotargeted nanoclusters produce a strong
   photoacoustic signal in the NIR that is optimum for tissue imaging.
   Furthermore, the labeled cells can be efficiently captured using an
   external magnetic field. The biocompatible magneto-plasmonic
   nanoparticles can make a significant impact in development of
   point-of-care assays for detection of circulating tumor cells, as well
   as in cell therapy with magnetic cell guidance and imaging monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by an application to school funding, we introduce the notion
   of a robust decomposable Markov decision process (MDP). A robust
   decomposable MDP model applies to situations where several MDPs, with
   the transition probabilities in each only known through an uncertainty
   set, are coupled together by joint resource constraints. Robust
   decomposable MDPs are different than both decomposable MDPs, and robust
   MDPs and cannot be solved by a direct application of the solution
   methods from either of those areas. In fact, to the best of our
   knowledge, there is no known method to tractably compute optimal
   policies in robust, decomposable MDPs. We show how to tractably compute
   good policies for this model, and apply the derived method to a stylized
   school funding example. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   bituminous coal cores exposed to CO2: Adsorption, swelling strains,
   swelling stresses and impact on fracture permeability}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The reservoir response of unmineable coal seams to primary and enhanced
   natural gas recovery is strongly affected by gas sorption and the
   swelling properties of the coal reservoir rock. In-depth understanding
   of the process of gas sorption/desorption in the coal matrix, induced
   deformation and measurement of relevant physical parameters are critical
   for predictive reservoir management. Models used in industry practice
   are based on swelling strains measured in ``free{''} swelling coal or on
   empirical correlations between strain and adsorption, and predict
   permeability changes based on changes of porosity or stress calculated
   assuming an analogy with thermoelasticity. However, not only coal seams
   are subjected to in-situ stresses and geometrical boundary conditions
   but also sorption and strain are strongly coupled. Representative
   experiments and a truly coupled model for coal seams are needed in
   challenging applications. We present a set of triaxial testing
   measurements on 38 mm diameter fractured sub-bituminous/bituminous coal
   cores exposed to CO2. Testing includes the measurement of fluid uptake,
   adsorption-induced strains and stresses, and the impact on
   simultaneously measured permeability. Noteworthy, we measured increases
   in effective stress of up to 29 MPa when injecting CO2 at 5 MPa and
   preventing the coal core to swell. The results are analyzed with a
   poromechanical model in which coal matrix microporosity and
   adsorption-induced phenomena are embedded into a fractured reservoir
   rock with transverse isotropic properties. The adsorptive-mechanical
   coupling in the coal matrix is integrated through an adsorption stress
   function and fractured coal permeability is estimated as a function of
   Terzaghi's effective stresses (parallel and perpendicular to the bedding
   plane). The experimental results and model predictions help identify the
   characteristic response of coal microporosity and cleat macroporosity on
   the poromechanical response of coal cores, and suggest that order of
   magnitude changes of reservoir permeability observed in the field are
   linked to sorption-induced change on Terzaghi's effective horizontal
   stress under laterally constrained displacement condition. Together, the
   modeling and experimental characterization offer unprecedented insights
   into the mechanics of coal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Single-atom catalysts are of great interest because of their high
   efficiency. In the case of chemically deposited sp(2) carbon, the
   implementation of a single transition metal atom for growth can provide
   crucial insight into the formation mechanisms of graphene and carbon
   nanotubes. This knowledge is particularly important if we are to
   overcome fabrication difficulties in these materials and fully take
   advantage of their distinct band structures and physical properties. In
   this work, we present atomically resolved transmission EM in situ
   investigations of single Fe atoms at graphene edges. Our in situ
   observations show individual iron atoms diffusing along an edge either
   removing or adding carbon atoms (viz., catalytic action). The
   experimental observations of the catalytic behavior of a single Fe atom
   are in excellent agreement with supporting theoretical studies. In
   addition, the kinetics of Fe atoms at graphene edges are shown to
   exhibit anomalous diffusion, which again, is in agreement with our
   theoretical investigations.}},

Abstract = {{eEF-2K is a potential target for treating cancer. However, potent
   specific inhibitors for this enzyme are lacking. Previously, we
   identified
   2,6-diamino-4-(2-fluorophenyl)-4H-thiopyran-3,5-dicarbonitrile (DFTD) as
   an inhibitor of eEF-2K. Here we describe its mechanism of action against
   eEF-2K, on the basis of kinetic, mutational, and docking studies, and
   use chemoinformatic approaches to identify a similar class of
   carbonitrile-containing compounds that exhibit the same mechanism of
   action. We show that DFTD behaves as a reversible covalent inhibitor of
   eEF-2K with a two-step mechanism of inhibition: a fast initial binding
   step, followed by a slower reversible inactivation step. Molecular
   docking suggests that a nitrile group of DFTD binds within 4.5 angstrom
   of the active site Cys146 to form a reversible thioimidate adduct.
   Because Cys146 is not conserved amongst other related kinases, targeting
   this residue holds promise for the development of selective covalent
   inhibitors of eEF-2K.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents analytical and experimental results for the
   velocity distribution and transport of expiratory particles from an
   artificial cough. The stream-wise penetration distance and velocity
   field of the cough jet were determined through a combination of
   dimensionless analysis and experimental techniques. The experiments were
   conducted in a well-controlled environmental chamber with simplified
   thermal manikins to simulate human coughs and buoyant thermal plumes,
   and involved flow visualization, velocity measurements employing high
   and low velocity hot-wire anemometers, and particle size and
   concentration measurement. The study analyzed three particle sizes-0.77,
   2.5, and 7 mu m-to examine the impact of particle size on particle
   transport in the cough jet region and in the vicinity of a receiver
   occupant positioned in close proximity to the coughing source. The
   results indicate that the cough jet has a lower axial velocity but
   higher span-wise expansion rate than a steady jet with an identical
   discharge velocity. The particles of three sizes have a similar
   trajectory when considering the transport in the cough jet region.
   However, particle concentration distributions of the three size
   particles show that size is an important factor for particle transport
   in the vicinity of the receiver occupant where airflow velocity decays
   to the room background air velocity. Furthermore, the results suggest
   that a cough jet is able to overcome the buoyant human thermal plume and
   travel further ahead in the region behind the receiver occupant.

Abstract = {{The capabilities of a high-resolution Digital Image Correlation (DIC)
   system are presented within the context of deformation measurements of
   full-scale concrete columns tested under reversed cyclic loading. The
   system was developed to have very high-resolution such that material
   strains on the order of the cracking stain of concrete could be measured
   on the surface of full-scale structural members. The high-resolution DIC
   system allows the measurement of a wide range of deformations and
   strains that could only be inferred or assumed previously. The DIC
   system is able to resolve the full profiles of member curvatures,
   rotations, plasticity spread, shear deformations, and bar-slip induced
   rotations. The system allows for automatic and objective measurement of
   crack widths and other damage indices that are indicative of cumulated
   damage and required repair time and cost. DIC damage measures contrast
   prevailing proxy damage indices based on member force-deformation data
   and subjective damage measures obtained using visual inspection. Data
   derived from high-resolution DIC systems is shown to be of great use in

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates the growth of crystalline SrTiO3 (STO) directly
   on germanium via a chemical method. After thermal deoxidation, the Ge
   substrate is transferred in vacuo to the deposition chamber where a thin
   film of STO (2 nm) is deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 225
   degrees C. Following post-deposition annealing at 650 degrees C for 5
   min, the STO film becomes crystalline with epitaxial registry to the
   underlying Ge (001) substrate. Thicker STO films (up to 15 nm) are then
   grown on the crystalline STO seed layer. The crystalline structure and
   orientation are confirmed via reflection high-energy electron
   diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy.
   Electrical measurements of a 15-nm thick epitaxial STO film on Ge show a
   large dielectric constant (k approximate to 90), but relatively high
   leakage current of approximate to 10 A/cm(2) for an applied field of 0.7
   MV/cm. To suppress the leakage current, an aluminum precursor is cycled
   during ALD growth to grow crystalline Al-doped STO (SrTi1-xAlxO3-delta)
   films. With sufficient Al doping (approximate to 13\%), the leakage
   current decreases by two orders of magnitude for an 8-nm thick film. The
   current work demonstrates the potential of ALD-grown crystalline oxides
   to be explored for advanced electronic applications, including
   highmobility Ge-based transistors.}},

Title = {{Simulation study on the CO2-driven enhanced gas recovery with
   sequestration versus the re-fracturing treatment of horizontal wells in
   the US unconventional shale reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{It is proposed that very low permeability formations are possible
   candidates for CO2 sequestration. Further, experimental studies have
   shown that shale formations have huge affinity to adsorb CO2, the order
   of 5 to 1 compared to the methane. Therefore, potential sequestration of
   CO2 in shale formations leading to enhanced gas recovery (EGR) will be a
   promising while challenging target for the oil and gas industry. On the
   other side, hydraulic re-fracturing treatment of shale gas wells is
   currently gaining more attention due to the poor performance of shale
   gas reservoirs after a couple years of production. Hence, investigating
   and comparing the performance of CO2-EGR with the re-fracturing
   treatment is essential for the future economic viability of depleted
   shale gas reservoirs. This paper presents a systematic comparison of the
   effect of these two processes on improving gas production performance of
   unconventional reservoirs, which is not well understood and has not been
   studied thoroughly in the literature.
   In this paper, a shale gas field data has been evaluated and
   incorporated in our simulations for both CO2-EGR and re-fracturing
   treatment purposes. Numerical simulations are performed using local grid
   refinement (LGR) in order to accurately model the non-linear pressure
   drop. Also, a dual-porosity/dual-permeability model is incorporated in
   the reservoir simulation model. Further, the uncertainties associated
   with inter-related set of geologic and engineering parameters are
   evaluated and quantified for refracturing treatment through several
   simulation runs. This comprehensive sensitivity study helps in
   understanding the key reservoir and fracture properties that affect the
   production performance and enhanced gas recovery in shale gas
   reservoirs. The results showed that re-fracturing treatment outperforms
   CO2-EGR due to the pronounced effect on cumulative methane gas
   production. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis showed that the
   characteristics of reservoir matrix including permeability and porosity
   are the most influential parameters for re-fracturing treatment The
   findings of this study recommend hydraulic re-fracturing of shale
   reservoirs at first for enhancing gas production followed by CO2
   injection at a later time. This work provides field operators with more
   insight into maximizing gas recovery from unconventional shale gas
   reservoirs using re-fracturing stimulation, CO2 injection, or a
   combination of both methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effect of natural fracture's closure on long-term gas production
   from unconventional resources}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{1205-1213}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The future U.S. and world energy supply is supported by the observed
   trends of long-term production forecasts from unconventional resources.
   Also, recent innovations in multi-pad horizontal drilling and hydraulic
   fracturing empower such trends to be economically viable. Nevertheless,
   the triggered fractures in an unconventional reservoir rapidly shrink,
   as a result of produced gas that leads to a significant loss in
   long-term production. Hence, it is critical to quantify the effect of
   fracture closure on long-term production for to reach an accurate
   production forecast. In this paper, the permeability changes of
   secondary fractures network are investigated with respect to their
   effect on the long-term gas production from unconventional resources.
   An analytical trilinear model is revised and improved in order to handle
   the constant bottom-hole pressure production scenario and hence
   analyzing the cumulative gas production by considering the effect of
   stress on natural fracture permeability. In addition, a comprehensive
   sensitivity study is performed to rank the influence of uncertain
   parameters on cumulative production and consequently identify a
   condition in which a severe effect of pressure-dependent natural
   fracture on production is observed. It is concluded that the
   pressure-dependent natural fracture permeability can cause up to ten
   percent less cumulative production than considering the constant natural
   fracture permeability. Also, the improved analytical model is very fast
   and robust compared to the commercial numerical simulators. The
   advantage of this approach is to obtain a quick and accurate assessment

Title = {{The effect of new media on consumer media usage: An empirical study in

Journal = {{TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{3-11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The advent and proliferation of the Internet (a form of new media) have
   heavily influenced consumers' media usage behavior and a number of other
   social, political, cultural, and economic outcomes. The recent
   introduction of smart mobile media, including smartphones and tablets,
   is expected to similarly affect these issues. This study empirically
   analyzes how the advent of the Internet and smart mobile media affects
   Korean consumers' media usage behavior, seeking to provide a means to
   anticipate the ripple effect to societal outcomes related to the
   evolution of new media in Korea. We modeled consumers' media usage
   behavior and conducted preference and simulation analyses using data
   gleaned from a survey of consumers' media behavior and a Multiple
   Discrete-Continuous Extreme Values (MDCEV) model. The results of the
   analyses illustrate how consumer preferences regarding old and new media
   differ in terms of socio-demographic variables. Moreover, the analyses
   revealed that whereas the advent of the Internet has negatively
   influenced consumers' use of old media, the arrival of smart mobile
   media has had a synergistic effect on television use. As a result, the
   advent of mobile media increased the use of television, but decreased
   use of other forms of old media. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic capability of a
   multimodal spectral diagnosis (SD) for in vivo noninvasive disease
   diagnosis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. We acquired
   reflectance, fluorescence, and Raman spectra from 137 lesions in 76
   patients using custom-built optical fiber-based clinical systems.
   Biopsies of lesions were classified using standard histopathology as
   malignant melanoma (MM), nonmelanoma pigmented lesion (PL), basal cell
   carcinoma (BCC), actinic keratosis (AK), and squamous cell carcinoma
   (SCC). Spectral data were analyzed using principal component analysis.
   Using multiple diagnostically relevant principal components, we built
   leave-one-out logistic regression classifiers. Classification results
   were compared with histopathology of the lesion. Sensitivity/specificity
   for classifying MM versus PL (12 versus 17 lesions) was 100\%/100\%, for
   SCC and BCC versus AK (57 versus 14 lesions) was 95\%/71\%, and for AK
   and SCC and BCC versus normal skin (71 versus 71 lesions) was 90\%/85\%.
   The best classification for nonmelanoma skin cancers required multiple
   modalities; however, the best melanoma classification occurred with
   Raman spectroscopy alone. The high diagnostic accuracy for classifying
   both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer lesions demonstrates the
   potential for SD as a clinical diagnostic device. c 2014 Society of

Title = {{Host-Compiled Multicore System Simulation for Early Real-Time
   Performance Evaluation}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{With increasing complexity and software content, modern embedded
   platforms employ a heterogeneous mix of multicore processors along with
   hardware accelerators in order to provide high performance in limited
   power budgets. To evaluate real-time performance and other constraints,
   full system simulations are essential. With traditional approaches being
   either slow or inaccurate, so-called source-level or host-compiled
   simulators have recently emerged as a solution for rapid evaluation of
   the complete system at early design stages. In such approaches, a faster
   simulation is achieved by abstracting execution behavior and increasing
   simulation granularity. However, existing source-level simulators often
   focus on application behavior only while neglecting the effects of
   hardware/software interactions and their associated speed and accuracy
   trade-offs.
   In this article, we present a host-compiled simulator that emulates
   software execution in a full-system context. Our simulator incorporates
   abstract models of both real-time operating systems (RTOSs) and
   multicore processors to replicate timing-accurate hardware/software
   interactions and to enable full system cosimulation. An integrated
   approach for automatic timing granularity adjustment (ATGA) uses
   observations of the system state to automatically control the timing
   model and optimally navigate speed versus accuracy conditions. Results
   as applied to industrial-strength platforms confirm that OS-and
   system-level effects can significantly contribute to overall accuracy
   and simulation overhead. By providing careful abstractions, our models
   can achieve full system simulations at equivalent speeds of more than a
   thousand MIPS with less than 3\% timing error. Coupled with the
   capability to easily adjust simulation parameters and configurations,
   this demonstrates the benefits of our simulator for early application
   development and design space exploration.}},

   Trough}},
Journal = {{MARINE GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{357}},
Pages = {{293-303}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{I characterized microporosity by performing low pressure nitrogen
   adsorption measurements on 13 shallow marine mudstone samples from the
   Nankai Trough offshore Japan. The samples were from two reference Sites
   on the incoming Philippine Sea Plate, and one Site above the
   accretionary prism. I determined pore size distributions using the
   Barrett-Joyner-Hallenda (BJH) model, and merged these with existing
   mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements to construct a
   full distribution covering micro- to macropores. I found that overall
   pore sizes decrease with consolidation, and that microporosity content
   (pores < 2 nm in diameter) is influenced mainly by mineralogy, with some
   influence of diagenetic processes. A small amount of microporosity
   (similar to 0.25\% of bulk sediment volume) is present in these
   sediments at the time of burial, presumably contained mainly in clays.
   Additional microporosity may develop as a result of alteration of
   volcanic ash at the reference Sites, and may be related to diagenetic
   processes that create zones of anomalous high porosity. Comparisons with
   porewater chemistry (K+, Ca2+, Sr, Si) show inconsistent relationships
   with microporosity development and cannot confirm or deny the role of
   ash alteration in this process. The strongest correlation observed at
   the three Sites was between microporosity volume and clay mineral
   fraction. This suggests that microporosity content is determined mainly
   by detrital clay abundance and development of clay as an ash alteration
   product, with some contribution from amorphous silica cement
   precipitated in the zones of anomalous high porosity. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objective of the study summarized in this paper was to develop
   simple, accurate, and conservative guidelines for the design of deep
   beams and discontinuity regions. To accomplish this goal, the authors
   compiled a database of 868 deep-beam shear tests from the literature and
   fabricated and tested 37 additional deep-beam specimens. The
   cross-sectional dimensions of the specimens that were tested included 36
   x 48 in. (910 x 1220 mm); 21 x 75 in. (530 x 1910 mm); 21 x 42 in. (530
   x 1070 mm); and 21 x 23 in. (530 x 580 mm). A comprehensive analysis of
   the database resulted in the following conclusions: 1) deep-beam shear
   design provisions of ACI 318-11 and AASHTO LRFD (2010) are overly
   conservative; and 2) the accuracy of existing design provisions can be
   improved without compromising their conservative nature. Accordingly,
   the authors propose recommendations to these methods to form an improved
   strut-and-tie modeling procedure. The transparently derived procedure is
   based on fundamental principles, current provisions, and experimental
   data. The authors recommend adoption of the proposed modifications into
   the ACI 318 and AASHTO LRFD provisions. An example problem illustrating
   the use of the proposed method is provided in the Appendix.}},

   measurements of the tractionseparation relations, which represent the
   strength and range of adhesive interactions, and the adhesion energy
   between wet-transferred, CVD grown graphene and the native oxide surface
   of silicon substrates. These were determined by coupling interferometry
   measurements of the separation between the graphene and silicon with
   fracture mechanics concepts and analyses. The measured adhesion energy
   was 357 +/- 16 mJ/m(2), which is commensurate with van der Waals
   interactions. However, the deduced tractionseparation relation for
   graphene-silicon interactions exhibited a much longer range interaction
   than those normally associated with van der Waals forces, suggesting

Abstract = {{The development and study of a benchtop, high-throughput, and
   inexpensive fabrication strategy to obtain hierarchical patterns of
   biomolecules with sub-50 nm resolution is presented. A diblock copolymer
   of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide), PS-b-PEO, is synthesized with
   biotin capping the PEO block and 4-bromostyrene copolymerized within the
   polystyrene block at 5 wt \%. These two handles allow thin films of the
   block copolymer to be postfunctionalized with biotinylated biomolecules
   of interest and to obtain micropatterns of nanoscale-ordered films via
   photolithography. The design of this single polymer further allows
   access to two distinct superficial nanopatterns (lines and dots), where
   the PEO cylinders are oriented parallel or perpendicular to the
   substrate. Moreover, we present a strategy to obtain hierarchical mixed
   morphologies: a thin-film coating of cylinders both parallel and
   perpendicular to the substrate can be obtained by tuning the solvent
   annealing and irradiation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Pore size distributions in rocks may be represented by fractal scaling,
   and fractal descriptions of pore systems may be used for prediction of
   petrophysical properties such as permeability, tortuosity, diffusivity,
   and electrical conductivity. Transverse relaxation time (T-2)
   distributions determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   measurements may be used to determine the fractal scaling of the pore
   system, but the analysis is complicated when internal magnetic field
   gradients at the pore scale are sufficiently large. Through computations
   in ideal porous media and laboratory measurements of glass beads and
   sediment samples, we found that the effect of internal magnetic field
   gradients was most pronounced in rocks with larger pores and a high
   magnetic susceptibility contrast between the pore fluid and mineral
   grains. We quantified this behavior in terms of pore size and
   Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) half-echo spacing through scaling
   arguments. We additionally found that the effects of internal field
   gradients may be mitigated in the laboratory by performing T-2
   measurements with different CPMG half-echo spacings and fitting the
   apparent fractal dimensions determined by the NMR measurements with a
   model to determine the true pore system fractal dimension.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual
   quality of a distorted image without information regarding its reference
   image. Existing BIQA models usually predict the image quality by
   analyzing the image statistics in some transformed domain, e. g., in the
   discrete cosine transform domain or wavelet domain. Though great
   progress has been made in recent years, BIQA is still a very challenging
   task due to the lack of a reference image. Considering that image local
   contrast features convey important structural information that is
   closely related to image perceptual quality, we propose a novel BIQA
   model that utilizes the joint statistics of two types of commonly used
   local contrast features: 1) the gradient magnitude (GM) map and 2) the
   Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) response. We employ an adaptive procedure to
   jointly normalize the GM and LOG features, and show that the joint
   statistics of normalized GM and LOG features have desirable properties
   for the BIQA task. The proposed model is extensively evaluated on three
   large-scale benchmark databases, and shown to deliver highly competitive
   performance with state-of-the-art BIQA models, as well as with some
   well-known full reference image quality assessment models.}},

Abstract = {{This study involved the development of an in situ ablation sensor
   designed to evaluate the recession rate for an ablative thermal
   protection system exposed to a hyperthermal environment. Design
   requirements specify that the sensor be constructed using multiple
   thermocouples at staggered depths, drilled and mounted into
   carbon/carbon composite and carbon/phenolic ablatives. During erosion,
   the thermocouples record thermal data and then melt when the flame front
   approaches the thermocouples. The position of the recession front and
   breaking time of the thermocouple can determine the ablation rate.
   Earlier designs developed by the authors' research group involved the
   use of 0.25-mm-diam thermocouples and electric discharge machining.
   Later designs used 0.5-mm-diam thermocouples using conventional
   microdrilling: This approach can be used in all applications in which
   the intrusiveness of the thermocouple embedded in the thermal protection
   system is not a primary requirement and allows 0.5mm thermocouples to be
   used as a replacement for ultrasmall and costly 0.25mm thermocouples.}},

Abstract = {{An automated method is developed to generate a minimum-fuel, finite
   thrust orbit insertion sequence while simultaneously generating a flyby
   trajectory of the same body that satisfies pre- and postflyby conditions
   in a general force field with ephemeris-level dynamics. The initial
   estimate requires no user input, and an impulsive solution is
   automatically converted to an optimal finite thrust transfer. As part of
   the initial estimate, a new method of generating ephemeris-level single
   flyby free returns is presented. A hybrid method is implemented for the
   optimal control solution whereby the costates are added to the vector of
   free parameters and the cost function is minimized directly. Analytic
   gradients are derived to decrease computation time and aid convergence
   of the optimization algorithm. The method is successfully applied in the
   Earth-moon system with application to human spaceflight and in the
   Saturn-Titan system with application to robotic spaceflight.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the activation energy of dopants in semiconducting
   nanomaterials is higher than in bulk materials owing to dielectric
   mismatch and quantum confinement. This quenches the number of free
   charge carriers in nanomaterials. Though higher doping concentration can
   compensate for this effect, there is no clear criterion on what the
   doping concentration should be. Using P-doped Si{[}110] nanowires as the
   prototypical system, we address this issue by establishing a doping
   limit by first-principles electronic structure calculations. We examine
   how the doped nanowires respond to charging using an effective
   capacitance approach. As the nanowire gets thinner, the interaction
   range of the P dopants shortens and the doping concentration can
   increase concurrently. Hence, heavier doping can remain nondegenerate
   for thin nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{High-assurance systems found in safety-critical infrastructures are

   information flows in the underlying hardware, including implicit flows
   through hardware-specific timing channels. However, existing work in
   this realm either restricts to two-level security labels or essentially
   targets two-input primitive gates and several simple multilevel security
   lattices. This article provides a general way to expand the GLIFT method
   for multilevel security. Specifically, it formalizes tracking logic for
   an arbitrary Boolean gate under finite security lattices, presents a
   precise tracking logic generation method for eliminating false positives
   in GLIFT logic created in a constructive manner, and illustrates
   application scenarios of GLIFT for enforcing multilevel information flow
   security. Experimental results show various trade-offs in precision and
   performance of GLIFT logic created using different methods. It also
   reveals the area and performance overheads that should be expected when
   expanding GLIFT for multilevel security.}},

Abstract = {{Single-layer graphene exhibits exceptional mechanical properties
   attractive for optomechanics: it combines low mass density, large
   tensile modulus, and low bending stiffness. However, at visible
   wavelengths, graphene absorbs weakly and reflects even less, thereby is
   inadequate to generate large optical forces needed in optomechanics.
   Here, we numerically show that a single-layer graphene sheet is
   sufficient to produce strong optical forces under terahertz or infrared
   illumination. For a system as simple as graphene suspended atop a
   uniform substrate, high reflectivity from the substrate is crucial in
   creating a standing-wave pattern, leading to a strong optical force on
   graphene. This force is readily tunable in amplitude and direction by
   adjusting the suspension height. In particular, repellent optical forces
   can levitate graphene to a series of stable equilibrium heights above
   the substrate. One of the key parameters to maximize the optical force
   is the excitation frequency: peak forces are found near the scattering
   frequency of free carriers in graphene. With a dynamically controllable
   Fermi level, graphene opens up new possibilities of tunable nanoscale
   optomechanical devices.}},

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{7673-7693}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Economic analysis and market simulation tools are used to evaluate
   uranium (U) supply shocks, sale or purchase of uranium stockpiles, or
   market effects of new uranium mines or enrichment technologies. This
   work expands on an existing U market model that couples the market for
   primary U from uranium mines with those of secondary uranium, e.g.,
   depleted uranium (DU) upgrading or highly enriched uranium (HEU) down
   blending, and enrichment services. This model accounts for the
   interdependence between the primary U supply on the U market price, the
   economic characteristics of each individual U mine, sources of secondary
   supply, and the U enrichment market. This work defines a procedure for
   developing an aggregate supply curve for primary uranium from marginal
   cost curves for individual firms (Uranium mines). Under this model,
   market conditions drive individual mines' startup and short- and
   long-term shutdown decisions. It is applied to the uranium industry for
   the period 2010-2030 in order to illustrate the evolution of the front
   end markets under conditions of moderate growth in demand for nuclear
   fuel. The approach is applicable not only to uranium mines but also
   other facilities and reactors within the nuclear economy that may be
   modeled as independent, decision-making entities inside a nuclear fuel
   cycle simulator.}},

Volume = {{190}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely used as the electrode material in
   touch-screen displays and solar cells attributing to its combined high
   electrical conductivity and optical transparency. Moving forward from
   wafer based electronics to flexible/stretchable electronics, brittle
   electronic materials like ITO are significantly hindering the
   deformability of the integrated systems. To minimize strains in
   inorganic materials when subjected to stretch, thin metallic and ceramic
   films can be patterned into serpentine shapes. Although metallic
   serpentines have received extensive studies, experimental investigations
   on ceramic serpentines have not been reported. We perform uniaxial
   tension tests on Kapton-supported ITO serpentine thin films with in situ
   electrical resistance measurements. It is found that the narrower
   serpentine ribbons are more stretchable than their wider counterparts.
   We propose a generic empirical equation to predict the stretchability
   using three dimensionless geometric parameters. Conclusions reached for
   Kapton-supported ITO serpentine films are generally applicable to gold,
   silicon, and other stiff serpentine films bonded to stiff polymer
   substrates such as Kapton and polyethylene terephthalate.}},

Abstract = {{We present the role of photogenerated charge carriers in the oxidation
   of CO by O-2 on reduced, rutile TiO2(110) based on first-principles DFT
   calculations. Our calculations show that hole-trapped O-2 at the O
   vacancy site adopts a tilted open ring configuration, while an
   additional electron preferentially localizes at the CO-bound Ti site.
   The electronhole separated configuration likely converts to the OOCO
   complex with a small barrier of around 0.1 eV. From the neutral
   intermediate state, CO2 is predicted to desorb off the surface with a
   barrier less than 0.2 eV if another hole is available. For comparison,
   we also look at both thermally activated and hole-mediated CO oxidation
   processes, but the predicted overall barriers of around 0.9 and 0.5 eV,
   respectively, appear to be high for facile CO oxidation at low
   temperatures. Our findings clearly highlight that excess electrons and
   holes can synergetically contribute to CO photooxidation, which is
   consistent with a recent experimental study by Petrik and Kimmel that
   provides evidence for involvement of multiple nonthermal reaction steps.}},

Abstract = {{Electrically tunable mid-infrared metasurfaces with nanosecond response

   Stark effect. Experimentally, a 220-nm-thick multi-quantum-well
   semiconductor layer is sandwiched between a ground plane and a metal
   layer patterned with plasmonic nanoresonators. Approximately 300 nm

   is shown with a response time less than approximate to 10 ns using bias
   voltage modulation between +2 V and +4 V. Since the bias affects the
   optical response at the individual nanoresonator level, this approach
   may be used to create metasurfaces for ultrafast electrical wavefront
   tuning and beam steering.}},

   lipolytica, only a low-copy CEN plasmid is available. In this study, we
   engineered the CEN plasmid from Y.lipolytica by fusing different
   promoters upstream of the centromeric region to regulate its function
   and expand its range. By doing this, we successfully improved the copy
   number and gene expression at plasmid level by 80\% and enabled a
   dynamic range of nearly 2.7-fold. This improvement was seen to be
   independent from both the promoter and gene used in the expression
   cassette. These results present a better starting point for more potent

Abstract = {{A novel single-source surface-volume-surface integral equation is
   proposed for accurate broadband resistance and inductance extraction in
   3-D interconnects. The new equation originates in the volume integral
   equation (VIE) traditionally used for magneto-quasi-static modeling of
   current flow in 3-D wires. The latter is reduced to a surface integral
   equation by representing the electric field inside each conductor
   segment as a superposition of cylindrical waves emanating from the
   conductor's boundary. As no approximation is utilized and all underlying
   boundary conditions and pertinent equations are satisfied in the
   reduction, the new integral equation is rigorously equivalent to the
   solution of the traditional volume electric field integral equation. The
   rigorous nature of the proposed single-source surface integral equation
   is corroborated numerically. In this paper, a detailed description of
   the method of moments discretization for the proposed surface integral
   equation is also presented. Numerical solution of the proposed surface
   integral equation for a 12-conductor bond-wire package is used to
   demonstrate the accuracy of the method and its computational benefits
   compared to the traditional solution based on the VIE.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene, a 2-D sheet of carbon atoms, is believed to have diverse
   application areas ranging from medicine to communications. A novel
   application is using graphene as a photodetector in optical
   communications due to its superior optical and electrical properties
   such as wide and tunable absorption frequency range and high electron
   mobility. Noise, which is especially significant in nanoscale
   communications, is mostly seen as an adversary. Stochastic resonance
   (SR) is the performance enhancement of a system due to incorporation of
   noise. It is shown that the excess noise in nanocommunications can be
   used to improve the performance of a graphene bilayer photodetector
   system with hard threshold decoder, when received signals are
   subthreshold. SR arises due to the nonlinear nature of the hard decoder.
   First, the SR effect due to the background ambient noise and intentional
   light noise is analyzed. An approximate inverse signal-to-noise ratio
   expression is derived, which maximizes the mutual information. The
   effect of frequency on the mutual information is also investigated, and
   it is shown that the higher frequencies are more preferable for noise
   limited regimes. Later, the case with the intentional noise added to the
   top gate is investigated. It is shown that significant mutual
   information improvements are achieved for subthreshold signals, due to
   the multiplicative stochastic terms arising from the nonlinear graphene
   bilayer characteristics, i.e., the exponential dependence of
   photocurrent on the gate voltages. All the analytical results are
   verified with extensive simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure-differential microphones inspired by the hearing mechanism of a
   special parasitoid fly have been described previously. The designs
   employ a beam structure that rotates about two pivots over an enclosed
   back volume. The back volume is only partially enclosed due to open
   slits around the perimeter of the beam. The open slits enable incoming
   sound waves to affect the pressure profile in the microphone's back
   volume. The goal of this work is to study the net moment applied to
   pressure-differential microphones by an incoming sound wave, which
   in-turn requires modeling the acoustic pressure distribution within the
   back volume. A lumped-element distributed transmission-line model of the
   back volume is introduced for this purpose. It is discovered that the
   net applied moment follows a low-pass filter behavior such that, at
   frequencies below a corner frequency depending on geometrical parameters
   of the design, the applied moment is unaffected by the open slits. This
   is in contrast to the high-pass filter behavior introduced by barometric
   pressure vents in conventional omnidirectional microphones. The model
   accurately predicts observed curvature in the frequency response of a
   prototype pressure-differential microphone 2 mm x 1 mm x 0.5 mm in size
   and employing piezoelectric readout. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{Tsunami computational models are employed to explore multiple flooding

   characterize here by three different parameters set to be constant in
   the on-shore, near-shore and deep-water regions as defined using
   iso-baths. We use Polynomial Chaos (PC) to build an inexpensive
   surrogate for the GEOCLAW model and employ Bayesian inference to
   estimate and quantify uncertainties related to relevant parameters using
   the DART buoy data collected during the T (o) over bar hoku tsunami. The
   surrogate model significantly reduces the computational burden of the
   Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the Bayesian inference. The
   PC surrogate is also used to perform a sensitivity analysis. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of characterizing a spatial partition of the
   position space of a team of vehicles with linear time-varying
   kinematics. The generalized metric that determines the proximity
   relations between the vehicles and an arbitrary target point in the
   partition space is the minimum control effort required for each vehicle
   to reach the latter point with zero miss distance and exactly zero
   velocity at a prescribed final time. We show that the solution to the
   generalized Voronoi partitioning problem can be associated with a
   special class of spatial partitions known as affine diagrams. Because
   the combinatorial complexity of the affine diagrams is comparable to the
   one of the standard Voronoi diagrams, their computation does not pose a
   significant challenge in applications of multi-vehicle systems.
   Subsequently, we propose an algorithm for the computation of the spatial
   partition, which is decentralized in the sense that each vehicle can
   compute an approximation of its own cell independently from the other
   vehicles from the same team without utilizing a common spatial mesh.
   Numerical simulations that illustrate the theoretical developments are
   also presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Admittance to detect alterations in left ventricular stroke volume}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators monitor intracardiac
   electrograms (EGMs) to discriminate between ventricular and
   supraventricular tachycardias. The incidence of inappropriate shocks
   remains high because of misclassification of the tachycardia in an
   otherwise hemodynamically stable individual. Coupling EGMs with an
   assessment of left ventricular (LV) stroke volume (SV) could help in
   gauging hemodynamics during an arrhythmia and reducing inappropriate
   shocks.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to use the admittance method to
   accurately derive LV SV.
   METHODS Ultrasonic flow probe and LV endocardial crystals were used in
   canines (n = 12) as the standard for LV SV. Biventricular pacing leads
   were inserted to obtain admittance measurements. A tetrapolar, complex
   impedance measurement was made between the Bi-V leads. The real and
   imaginary components of impedance were used to discard the myocardial
   component from the blood component to derive instantaneous blood
   conductance (G(b)). Alterations in SV were measured during right
   ventricular pacing, dopamine infusion, and inferior vena cava occlusion.
   RESULTS G(b) tracks steady-state changes in SV more accurately than
   traditional magnitude (ie. IYI, without removal of the muscle signal)
   during right ventricular pacing and dopamine infusion (P = .004).
   Instantaneous LV volume also was tracked more accurately by G(b) than
   vertical bar Y vertical bar in the subset of subjects that underwent
   inferior vena cava occlusions (n = 5, P = .025). Finite element modeling
   demonstrates that admittance shifts more sensitivity of the measurement
   to the LV blood chamber as the mechanism for improvement (see Online
   Appendix).
   CONCLUSION Monitoring LV SV is possible using the admittance method with
   biventricular pacing leads. The technique could be piggybacked to
   complement EGMs to determine if arrhythmias are hemodynamically
   unstable.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this work was to demonstrate computationally that
   realistic human hearts can be cooled much faster by performing conjugate
   heat transfer consisting of pumping a cold liquid through the cardiac
   chambers and major veins while keeping the heart submerged in cold
   gelatin filling a cooling container. The human heart geometry used for
   simulations was obtained from three-dimensional, high resolution
   CT-angio scans. Two fluid flow domains for the right (pulmonic) and left
   (systemic) heart circulations, and two solid domains for the heart
   tissue and gelatin solution were defined for multi-domain numerical
   simulation. Detailed unsteady temperature fields within the heart tissue
   were calculated during the conjugate cooling process. A linear
   thermoelasticity analysis was performed to assess the stresses applied
   on the heart due to the coolant fluid shear and normal forces and to
   examine the thermal stress caused by temperature variation inside the
   heart. It was demonstrated that a conjugate cooling effort with coolant
   temperature at +4 degrees C is capable of reducing the average heart
   temperature from +37 degrees C to +8 degrees C in 25 minutes for cases
   in which the coolant was steadily pumped only through major heart inlet
   veins and cavities. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Solving large-scale PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems with
   Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We consider the Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) method
   for solving statistical inverse problems governed by partial
   differential equations (PDEs). The Bayesian framework is employed to
   cast the inverse problem into the task of statistical inference whose
   solution is the posterior distribution in infinite dimensional parameter
   space conditional upon observation data and Gaussian prior measure. We
   discretize both the likelihood and the prior using the H-1-conforming
   finite element method together with a matrix transfer technique. The
   power of the RMHMC method is that it exploits the geometric structure
   induced by the PDE constraints of the underlying inverse problem.
   Consequently, each RMHMC posterior sample is almost
   uncorrelated/independent from the others providing statistically
   efficient Markov chain simulation. However this statistical efficiency
   comes at a computational cost. This motivates us to consider
   computationally more efficient strategies for RMHMC. At the heart of our
   construction is the fact that for Gaussian error structures the Fisher
   information matrix coincides with the Gauss-Newton Hessian. We exploit
   this fact in considering a computationally simplified RMHMC method
   combining state-of-the-art adjoint techniques and the superiority of the
   RMHMC method. Specifically, we first form the Gauss-Newton Hessian at
   the maximum a posteriori point and then use it as a fixed constant
   metric tensor throughout RMHMC simulation. This eliminates the need for
   the computationally costly differential geometric Christoffel symbols,
   which in turn greatly reduces computational effort at a corresponding
   loss of sampling efficiency. We further reduce the cost of forming the
   Fisher information matrix by using a low rank approximation via a
   randomized singular value decomposition technique. This is efficient
   since a small number of Hessian-vector products are required. The
   Hessian-vector product in turn requires only two extra PDE solves using
   the adjoint technique. Various numerical results up to 1025 parameters
   are presented to demonstrate the ability of the RMHMC method in
   exploring the geometric structure of the problem to propose (almost)
   uncorrelated/independent samples that are far away from each other, and
   yet the acceptance rate is almost unity. The results also suggest that
   for the PDE models considered the proposed fixed metric RMHMC can attain
   almost as high a quality performance as the original RMHMC, i.e.
   generating (almost) uncorrelated/independent samples, while being two
   orders of magnitude less computationally expensive.}},

Title = {{Likelihood-informed dimension reduction for nonlinear inverse problems}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The intrinsic dimensionality of an inverse problem is affected by prior
   information, the accuracy and number of observations, and the smoothing
   properties of the forward operator. From a Bayesian perspective, changes
   from the prior to the posterior may, in many problems, be confined to a
   relatively low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. We present a
   dimension reduction approach that defines and identifies such a
   subspace, called the `likelihood-informed subspace' (LIS), by
   characterizing the relative influences of the prior and the likelihood
   over the support of the posterior distribution. This identification
   enables new and more efficient computational methods for Bayesian
   inference with nonlinear forward models and Gaussian priors. In
   particular, we approximate the posterior distribution as the product of
   a lower-dimensional posterior defined on the LIS and the prior
   distribution marginalized onto the complementary subspace. Markov chain
   Monte Carlo sampling can then proceed in lower dimensions, with
   significant gains in computational efficiency. We also introduce a
   Rao-Blackwellization strategy that de-randomizes Monte Carlo estimates
   of posterior expectations for additional variance reduction. We
   demonstrate the efficiency of our methods using two numerical examples:
   inference of permeability in a groundwater system governed by an
   elliptic PDE, and an atmospheric remote sensing problem based on Global
   Ozone Monitoring System (GOMOS) observations.}},

Abstract = {{VF from Papillary Muscle
   BackgroundAnimal studies showed that papillary muscles can be sources of
   ventricular fibrillation (VF) in both the left and right ventricle, but
   this occurrence in humans has been described only in patients with
   ischemic heart disease.
   ObjectiveTo investigate the role of papillary muscle premature
   ventricular contractions (PVCs) as triggers for VF and the safety and
   feasibility of catheter ablation in these patients.
   MethodsSix patients (2 male; age, 40 11 years; 5 with a normal
   structural heart and 1 with nonischemic cardiomyopathy) with history of
   VF resulting in repetitive implantable cardioverter defibrillator
   shocks, despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and a papillary muscle
   focus of PVCs triggering VF were included and underwent mapping and
   ablation of PVCs.
   ResultsPVCs were observed to trigger VF and localized by mapping the
   earliest activation point that matched pace mapping of the same area. In
   2 patients, PVCs originated from the left ventricle at the posteromedial
   papillary muscle; in 4 patients, PVCs originated from the right
   ventricle, at the posterolateral papillary muscle. Elimination of the
   triggering PVC was obtained in these areas after 19 +/- 12 minutes by
   radiofrequency application. During a follow-up of 58 +/- 11 months using
   ambulatory monitoring and defibrillator memory interrogation, no
   patients had recurrence of symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias.
   ConclusionPapillary muscles from both ventricles represent an anatomic
   structure potentially involved in the onset of VF, also in normal
   structural heart. PVCs arising from this area can be successfully
   eliminated by radiofrequency ablation, resulting in freedom from
   recurrent VF at long-term follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Absorption/stripping using alkanolamine solvents for removing CO2 from
   the flue gas of coal-fired power plants requires a substantial amount of
   energy. Typical designs anticipate the use of steam extraction between
   the Intermediate Pressure (IP) and Low Pressure (LP) turbines to provide
   heat for the reboiler. Geothermal energy in the form of hot brine offers
   an alternative to this large parasitic load on the power generation
   cycle. We investigate the requirements (number and spacing of
   extraction/injection well pairs) to provide heat at 150 degrees C for a
   pilot scale (60 MWe) and a full scale (900 MWe) capture process for
   thirty years. The calculations are based on properties of a
   geopressured/geothermal aquifer near the Texas Gulf Coast. In the
   vicinity of a large coal-fired power plant in South Texas, this aquifer
   lies between 3 050 and 3 350 m (10 000 and 11 000 ft) below the surface.
   We present a novel design of the stripper/regenerator process based on
   heat exchange with the brine, discharging the brine at 100 degrees C.
   The results indicate that the overall process is feasible and that costs
   are of similar magnitude to standard designs.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been interest in employing atomistic
   computations to inform macroscale thermal transport analyses. In heat
   conduction simulations in semiconductors and dielectrics, for example,
   classical molecular dynamics (MD) is used to compute phonon relaxation
   times, from which material thermal conductivity may be inferred and used
   at the macroscale. A drawback of this method is the noise associated
   with MD simulation (here after referred to as MD noise), which is
   generated due to the possibility of multiple initial configurations
   corresponding to the same system temperature. When MD is used to compute
   phonon relaxation times, the spread may be as high as 20\%. In this
   work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty in thermal
   conductivity computations due to MD noise, and its effect on the
   computation of the temperature distribution in heat conduction
   simulations. Bayesian inference is used to construct a probabilistic
   surrogate model for thermal conductivity as a function of temperature,
   accounting for the statistical spread in MD relaxation times. The
   surrogate model is used in probabilistic computations of the temperature
   field in macroscale Fourier conduction simulations. These simulations
   yield probability density functions (PDFs) of the spatial temperature
   distribution resulting from the PDFs of thermal conductivity. To allay
   the cost of probabilistic computations, a stochastic collocation
   technique based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) is used to
   construct a response surface for the variation of temperature (at each
   physical location in the domain) as a function of the random variables
   in the thermal conductivity model. Results are presented for the spatial
   variation of the probability density function of temperature as a
   function of spatial location in a typical heat conduction problem to
   establish the viability of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Foamed asphalt binders are increasingly being used to produce warm mix
   asphalt. This paper presents the findings from a study conducted to (1)
   identify a repeatable and accurate method to characterize the quality of
   asphalt binder foams, and (2) use this method to evaluate the influence
   of water content, binder type, and foaming device on the quality of
   foamed binders. Laser and ultrasonic distance-measuring tools were used
   in combination with digital imaging of the foamed surface to quantify
   and better understand the expansion and decay of foamed asphalt binders
   over time. Measurements obtained from these methods were used to
   evaluate the extent and stability of foams produced using three
   different asphalt binders at three water contents and two laboratory
   foaming devices. Rheological properties and moisture content of selected
   binder residues were also measured. Results indicate that both the
   laser- and ultrasonic-based methods were promising in terms of their
   ability to provide a repeatable and detailed history of the change in
   volume of the foamed asphalt binder as the foam collapses. It was also
   shown that water content and binder type have a significant influence on
   the maximum expansion ratio and rate of collapse of foams. Higher water
   contents were associated with higher expansion ratios but also faster
   rates of collapse. The two foaming devices used in this study produced
   foams with similar properties. Rheological tests conducted on foamed
   binder residues revealed that the foaming process slightly increased the
   high temperature continuous performance grade (PG) of the binder. (C)

Title = {{Behavior of Impregnated Paving Geotextiles: Study of Optimum Tack Coat
   Rate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Paving geotextiles are becoming increasingly used in highway
   construction overlays in order to recover cracked asphalt pavements. In
   antireflective cracking systems, the geosynthetic should have the
   ability to absorb and retain the asphalt tack coat to effectively bond
   the system to the existing pavement and overlay. However, the type and
   rate of tack coat impregnation can significantly influence the
   reinforcement mechanism, potentially leading to early overlay failure.
   Stiffness has been identified as the governing property to quantify the
   potential contribution of the interlayer to the asphalt overlay
   strength. In addition, the overall behavior of reinforced asphalt
   pavements may also be incorporated with an increased tensile strength of
   the geosynthetic. With the purpose of quantifying the often significant
   changes in the mechanical behavior of paving geosynthetics that occur
   after bitumen impregnation, a series of tensile strength tests were
   conducted in this study using nonwoven geotextiles with different rates
   of asphalt emulsion. Evaluation of the geosynthetics changes in tensile
   strength and tensile stiffness with increasing tack coat rates provides
   insight on the identification of an optimum bitumen dosage for these
   materials. A tack coat rate equal to the asphalt retention capacity was
   specifically evaluated in this study and was generally found to be the
   optimum rate that leads to the highest tensile strength and stiffness of
   impregnated of geotextiles. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Successful realization of dual-mode scramjet engines will require
   closed-loop control schemes to eliminate the occurrence of inlet
   unstart. A nimportant step toward this goal is the development of
   dynamic models for shock system motion inside the inlet isolator under
   varying flow conditions. In this paper, shock motion models are
   developed based on fast-response pressure measurements made along the
   wall of the isolator (straight channel) downstream of a Mach 1.8 nozzle.
   The shock system can be perturbed by changing the stagnation pressure
   with an upstream valve and/or by changing the backpressure with a
   downstream flap. In particular, the shock's transient dynamics are
   modeled, which govern the unstart process and are induced by changing
   pressure-boundary conditions, by employing system identification
   techniques. The result is a partially nonlinear dynamic model that
   reveals the possibility of partitioning the nonlinear behavior from the
   linear dynamics with relative ease. A second dynamic model is then
   generated, where the nonlinear portion has been prespecified, leaving
   only the linear portion to be determined by system identification. The
   modeling and identification process specific to the experimental unstart
   data used are discussed and successful models are presented for both the
   full system identification and the partitioned model cases.}},

Title = {{On the Use of Site Data to Define Extreme Turbulence Conditions for Wind
   Turbine Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{In wind turbine design, external conditions to be considered depend on
   the intended site for the planned installation. Wind turbine classes,
   defined in terms of wind speed and turbulence parameters, cover most
   sites and applications. In the International Electrotechnical
   Commission's (IEC's) 61400-1 standard, there is a design load case that
   requires consideration for ultimate loading resulting from extreme
   turbulence conditions. Since site-specific wind conditions should not
   compromise the structural integrity of turbine installations, at some
   sites where class-based design may not apply, there is sometimes a need
   to establish extreme turbulence (50-year) levels as part of site
   assessment by making use of measurements. This should be done in a
   manner consistent with class-based design where the extreme turbulence
   model (ETM) provides 50-year turbulence standard deviation (sigma) value
   as a function of the ten minute average hub-height wind speed, V. For
   one site in Germany and three contrasting terrain sites in Japan, wind
   velocity data are used to establish 50-year ETM levels. The inverse
   first-order reliability method (IFORM) is applied with 10 min data for
   this purpose. Sometimes, as in assessing wind farm wake effects,
   analysis of turbulence levels by direction sector is important because
   normal and extreme turbulence levels can vary by sector. We compare ETM
   levels by sector for the Hamburg, Germany site. The influence of terrain
   complexity on ETM levels is also of interest; the three sites in Japan
   have contrasting terrain characteristics-referred to as flat, hilly, and
   mountainous. ETM levels are compared for these three terrain types. An
   important overall finding of this study is that site-specific ETM levels
   can greatly exceed levels specified in the standard for class-based
   design.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a frequency-domain hp-adaptive Finite Element (PE)
   Method for a class of coupled acoustics/elasticity/poroelasticity
   problems with application to modeling of acoustic logging measurements
   in complex borehole environments. The paper extends methodology,
   software, and results presented in Matuszyk et al. (2012). We derive for
   poroelastic media a mixed weak formulation, which is closely related to
   the enhanced (u, p) formulation developed by Atalla et al. (2001). The
   formulation is extended to the transversely anisotropic (VTI) case, and
   makes use of the viscodynamic operator, which enables more accurate
   calculations for higher frequencies. In this approach, a special split
   of the differential operator results in boundary and coupling conditions
   that can be easily implemented within the FE framework. The appropriate
   PML technique is employed to truncate the computational domain.
   Accordingly, the original hp-FE code is modified by the implementation
   of the appropriate scaling of the independent variables to make
   efficient the automatic adaptation algorithm. Solutions of non-trivial
   examples involving formations with permeable layers are presented. They
   positively verify the consistency and accuracy of the presented method.

Abstract = {{High-performance stretchable electronics have to utilize high-quality
   inorganic electronic materials such as silicon, oxide or nitride
   dielectrics, and metals. These inorganic materials usually crack or
   yield at very small intrinsic strains, for example, 1\%, whereas
   bio-integrated electronics are expected to at least match the
   stretchability of bio-tissues (20\%) and deployable structure health
   monitoring networks are expected to expand from wafer scale (several
   centimeters) to cover macroscopic structures (several meters). To
   minimize strains in inorganic materials under large deformation,
   metallic and ceramic films can be patterned into serpentine-shaped
   ribbons. When the ribbon is stretched, some sections of the ribbon can
   rotate and/or buckle to accommodate the applied displacement, leaving
   much smaller intrinsic strain in the materials compared to the applied
   strain. The choice of the shape of the serpentine depends on systematic
   studies of the geometric variables. This paper investigates the effect
   of serpentine shapes on their stretchability and compliance through
   theoretical, numerical, and experimental means. Our closed-form curved
   beam solutions, FEM results, and experimental measurements have found
   good agreement with one another. Our results conclude that in general,
   the narrower ribbon, the larger arc radius and arc angle, and the longer
   arm length will yield lower intrinsic strain and effective stiffness.
   When the arm length approaches infinite, the stretchability can be
   enhanced by several orders. A few unexpected behaviors are found at arc
   angles that are close to straight bars. With additional practical
   constraints such as minimum ribbon width and finite overall breadth, the
   optimal serpentine shape can be accurately determined using our
   closed-form analytical solution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Two piezoelectric transducer modes applied in microelectromechanical
   systems are (i) the 3-1 mode with parallel electrodes perpendicular to a
   vertical polarization vector, and (ii) the 3-3 mode which uses
   interdigitated (IDT) electrodes to realize an in-plane polarization
   vector. This study compares the two configurations by deriving a Norton
   equivalent representation of each approach - including expressions for
   output charge and device capacitance. The model is verified using a
   microfabricated device comprised of multiple epitaxial silicon beams
   with sol-gel deposited lead zirconate titanate at the surface. The beams
   have identical dimensions and are attached to a common moving element at
   their tips. The only difference between beams is electrode configuration
   - enabling a direct comparison. Capacitance and charge measurements
   verify the presented theory with high accuracy. The Norton equivalent
   representation is general and enables comparison of any figure of merit,
   including electromechanical coupling coefficient and signal-to-noise
   ratio. With respect to coupling coefficient, the experimentally
   validated theory in this work suggests that 3-3 mode IDT-electrode
   configurations offer the potential for modest improvements compared
   against 3-1 mode devices (less than 2x), and the only geometrical
   parameter affecting this ratio is the fill factor of the IDT electrode.

Abstract = {{In the present work, we demonstrate that the mesoscopic in-plane
   mechanical behavior of membrane elastomeric scaffolds can be simulated
   by replication of actual quantified fibrous geometries. Elastomeric
   electrospun polyurethane (ES-PEUU) scaffolds, with and without
   particulate inclusions, were utilized. Simulations were developed from
   experimentally-derived fiber network geometries, based on a range of
   scaffold isotropic and anisotropic behaviors. These were chosen to
   evaluate the effects on macro-mechanics based on measurable geometric
   parameters such as fiber intersections, connectivity, orientation, and
   diameter. Simulations were conducted with only the fiber material model
   parameters adjusted to match the macro-level mechanical test data. Fiber
   model validation was performed at the microscopic level by individual
   fiber mechanical tests using AFM. Results demonstrated very good
   agreement to the experimental data, and revealed the formation of
   extended preferential fiber orientations spanning the entire model
   space. We speculate that these emergent structures may be responsible
   for the tissue-like macroscale behaviors observed in electrospun
   scaffolds. To conclude, the modeling approach has implications for (1)
   gaining insight on the intricate relationship between fabrication
   variables, structure, and mechanics to manufacture more functional
   devices/materials, (2) elucidating the effects of cell or particulate
   inclusions on global construct mechanics, and (3) fabricating better
   performing tissue surrogates that could recapitulate native tissue
   mechanics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A tissue engineering chondrocytes/scaffold construct provides a promise
   to cartilage regeneration. The architecture of a scaffold such as
   interconnections, porosities, and pore sizes influences the fates of
   seeding cells including gene expression, survival, migration,
   proliferation, and differentiation thus may determine the success of
   this approach. Scaffolds of highly ordered and uniform structures are
   desirable to control cellular behaviors. In this study, a newly designed
   microfluidic device based on flow-focusing geometry was developed to
   fabricate gelatin scaffolds of ordered pores. In comparison with random
   foam scaffolds made by the conventional freeze-dried method,
   honeycomb-like scaffolds exhibit higher swelling ratio, porosity, and
   comparable compressive strength. In addition, chondrocytes grown in the
   honeycomb-like scaffolds had good cell viability, survival rate,
   glycosaminoglycans production, and a better proliferation than ones in
   freeze-dried scaffolds. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA
   expressions of aggrecan and collagen type II were up-regulated when
   chondrocytes cultured in honeycomb-like scaffolds rather than cells
   cultured as monolayer fashion. Oppositely, chondrocytes expressed
   collagen type II as monolayer culture when seeded in freeze-dried
   scaffolds. Histologic examinations revealed that cells produced
   proteoglycan and distributed uniformly in honeycomb-like scaffolds.
   Immunostaining showed protein expression of S-100 and collagen type II
   but negative for collagen type I and X, which represents the
   chondrocytes maintained normal phenotype. In conclusion, a highly
   ordered and honeycomb-like scaffold shows superior performance in
   cartilage tissue engineering. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new methodology for designing a nonlinear rotational spring
   with a desired passive torque profile by using a noncircular
   pulley-spring mechanism. A synthesis procedure for the shape of the
   noncircular pulley is presented. The method is based on an infinitesimal
   calculus approach that leads to an analytical solution, and the method
   is extended to address practical design issues related to the cable
   routing. Based on the synthesis method, an antagonistic spring
   configuration is designed for bilateral torque generation and is
   designed such that there is no slack in the routing cables. Two design
   examples are presented, namely, double exponential torque generation and
   gravity compensation for an inverted pendulum. Experiments with a
   mechanism for gravity compensation of an inverted pendulum validate our
   approach. We extend our approach to generate nonlinear torques at two
   joints by introducing the concept of torque decomposition. Experiments
   with a two-link robotic arm show that the gravitational forces from the
   masses on each link are accurately compensated for with our noncircular
   pulley-spring mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The risk of exposure to pollutants in mattress dust is enhanced by the
   extended period that people spend every day in their sleep
   microenvironments. Epidemiological studies have shown strong
   associations between exposure to these pollutants and health risks.
   Blankets, pillows, and mattresses have been considered as major sources
   of accumulated dust particles, which may become airborne through a
   process known as resuspension. Therefore, a better understanding of the
   impact of bedding arrangements on human-induced particle resuspension in
   the sleep microenvironment is needed. In this investigation,
   participants performed sets of prescribed movements on an
   artificially-seeded mattress. Ten different bedding arrangements were
   examined. Airborne particle number concentrations were measured to
   estimate size-resolved resuspension rates (RR). Across all particle
   sizes and bedding arrangements, RRs ranged from 10(-3) to 10(1) h(-1),
   with higher RRs associated with larger particles. RRs for a seeded
   pillow were greater than RRs for a seeded blanket or seeded mattress.
   The use of an additional pillow cover did act as an effective barrier to
   the penetration of larger particles deposited on the underlying pillow
   surface. Additionally, blankets were not found to be a significant
   barrier for particles resuspended from the underlying seeded mattress.
   Intake fractions (iF) were in the range of 10(2) to 10(4) ppm (10(-4) to
   10(-2) on a fractional basis), suggesting a significant fraction of
   released particles can reach the breathing zone region. The highest iF
   was estimated for an arrangement where both a pillow and a mattress were
   seeded without a blanket present (10(4) ppm). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic materials are gaining increased interest as renewable
   sources of building materials. However, chemical and microbiological
   degradation can occur when lignocellulosic materials are exposed to
   environmental stressors such as ozone and elevated humidity. In this
   study, the effects of ozone treatment and solvent extraction on fungal
   growth rates of bamboo and oak flooring materials were investigated. One
   set of samples was extracted with a mixture of cyclohexane and ethanol
   solvents for 72 h to remove extractable compounds. Another set of
   materials was exposed continuously to ozone (2000 mu L m(-3) or 2000
   ppb(v)) for one to five weeks. Solvent-extracted and ozone-treated
   samples were incubated in closed chambers at 85\% or 55\% RH and 30
   degrees C. Incubated samples were removed at regular time intervals for
   fungal growth evaluation. Ozone treatment caused chemical changes in
   bamboo and oak, which appeared to reduce bamboo's resistance to fungal
   attack. Longer ozone exposure led to higher susceptibility to fungal
   growth. Untreated and ozone-treated oak showed no evidence of fungal
   growth, suggesting that this material may contain fungi-inhibitory
   compounds that are not removed by these treatments. Also, a delay in
   fungal growth on cyclohexane/ethanol-extracted bamboo was observed,
   probably due to the extraction process removing substances that enhanced
   fungal growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide (G-O) flakes were used to seed the growth of single
   crystal graphene islands by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Cu foil.
   Such islands have the G-O seed (which converts to a `reduced graphene
   oxide' (rG-O) seed due to the CVD growth conditions used) roughly in the
   center of the islands. The lateral growth of such single crystal
   graphene islands was studied by carbon isotope labeling and Raman
   spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and selected
   area electron diffraction. By changing the concentration of G-O in the
   aqueous dispersion used to deposit the G-O flakes onto the Cu foil by
   dip-coating, the size of the seeded graphene islands could be precisely
   controlled on the Cu foil. The crystal orientation of the single crystal
   graphene islands was found to be identical to that of the G-O seeds. (C)

   finite and semi-infinite cylindrical ducts}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{1155-1165}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A semi-analytical solution for the transient advection diffusion
   reaction problem within finite and semi-infinite ducts is derived. The
   solution allows for general radial- and time-dependent inlet/outlet
   conditions, complex boundary conditions on the duct wall including
   adsorption and decay, and arbitrary velocity profiles of the
   transporting fluid. The only numerical step of the solution is the
   inverse Laplace transform in the time variable. Therefore, the approach
   also produces fully analytical steady-state solutions. The solution is
   verified against computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations under
   various boundary conditions and velocity profiles (Newtonian and
   power-law), and in all cases good agreement is obtained. Although
   theoretically applicable to all regimes, the solution is computationally
   difficult at very high Peclet numbers and very early times due to
   numerical instabilities as a result of finite precision arithmetic of
   computers. A convergence analysis is conducted to delineate the
   boundaries of this limit for two important cases.
   The solution was derived using a new approach for solving
   two-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) with non-constant
   coefficients which parallels the Frobenius and power series methods for
   solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The approach reduces the
   original PDE to a single infinite-order ODE with constant coefficients.
   The approach is suspected to provide solutions to a large class of PDEs
   of this type. The solution may find applications in a number of
   engineering and/or biomedical fields, it can be used to verify numerical
   simulators, and serve as a simple and easy-to-implement alternative
   where access to numerical simulators is not available. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Hyperbolic-metamaterial antennas for broadband enhancement of dipole
   emission to free space}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Dipole emitters used in nano optics and nanophotonics (e.g., fluorescent
   molecules or quantum dots) are weak radiators and thus detecting the
   radiation of a single emitter gets possible only if it is significantly
   enhanced. For this enhancement, one often utilizes resonant nanoantennas
   (Purcell's effect); this method, however, requires the exact knowledge
   of source location and radiation frequency which constitute a
   significant drawback. One known possibility for broadband
   location-insensitive radiation enhancement is to use a layer of the
   so-called hyperbolic metamaterial. However, the enhanced radiated energy
   is mainly directed into the volume of the lossy medium, where it is lost
   to heating. In this work, we suggest specific shapes of macroscopic
   hyperbolic metamaterial samples to open radiation windows for enhanced
   radiation to free space. We show that hyperbolic media slabs with
   properly shaped macroscopic grooves convert the evanescent waves
   produced by a dipole into waves traveling in free space, which results
   in the enhancement of useful radiation by one to two orders of
   magnitude. That level of enhancement of radiation into free-space which
   is also wideband and of non-resonant nature has not been reported up to
   now. These results may open possibilities for realization of broadband
   and directive antennas, where the primary radiators are randomly
   positioned fluorescent molecules or quantum dots. (C) 2014 AIP

Title = {{Basin constrained kappa-dimer method for saddle point finding}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Within the harmonic approximation to transition state theory, the rate
   of escape from a reactant is calculated from local information at saddle
   points on the boundary of the state. The dimer minimum-mode following
   method can be used to find such saddle points. But as we show, dimer
   searches that are initiated from a reactant state of interest can
   converge to saddles that are not on the boundary of the reactant state.
   These disconnected saddles are not directly useful for calculating the
   escape rate. Additionally, the ratio of disconnected saddles can be
   large, especially when the dimer searches are initiated far from the
   reactant minimum. The reason that the method finds disconnected saddles
   is a result of the fact that the dimer method tracks local ridges,
   defined as the set of points where the force is perpendicular to the
   negative curvature mode, and not the true ridge, defined as the boundary
   of the set of points which minimize to the reactant. The local ridges
   tend to deviate from the true ridge away from saddle points.
   Furthermore, the local ridge can be discontinuous and have holes which
   allow the dimer to cross the true ridge and escape the initial state. To
   solve this problem, we employ an alternative definition of a local ridge
   based upon the minimum directional curvature of the isopotential
   hyperplane, kappa, which provides additional local information to tune
   the dimer dynamics. We find that hyperplanes of kappa = 0 pass through
   all saddle points but rarely intersect with the true ridge elsewhere. By
   restraining the dimer within the kappa < 0 region, the probability of
   converging to disconnected saddles is significantly reduced and the
   efficiency of finding connected saddles is increased. (c) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{The injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured at large point sources
   into deep saline aquifers can significantly reduce anthropogenic CO2
   emissions from fossil fuels. Dissolution of the injected CO2 into the
   formation brine is a trapping mechanism that helps to ensure the
   long-term security of geological CO2 storage. We use thermochronology to
   estimate the timing of CO2 emplacement at Bravo Dome, a large natural
   CO2 field at a depth of 700 m in New Mexico. Together with estimates of
   the total mass loss from the field we present, to our knowledge, the
   first constraints on the magnitude, mechanisms, and rates of CO2
   dissolution on millennial timescales. Apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology
   records heating of the Bravo Dome reservoir due to the emplacement of
   hot volcanic gases 1.2-1.5 Ma. The CO2 accumulation is therefore
   significantly older than previous estimates of 10 ka, which demonstrates
   that safe long-term geological CO2 storage is possible. Integrating
   geophysical and geochemical data, we estimate that 1.3 Gt CO2 are
   currently stored at Bravo Dome, but that only 22\% of the emplaced CO2
   has dissolved into the brine over 1.2 My. Roughly 40\% of the
   dissolution occurred during the emplacement. The CO2 dissolved after
   emplacement exceeds the amount expected from diffusion and provides
   field evidence for convective dissolution with a rate of 0.1 g/(m(2)y).
   The similarity between Bravo Dome and major US saline aquifers suggests
   that significant amounts of CO2 are likely to dissolve during injection
   at US storage sites, but that convective dissolution is unlikely to trap
   all injected CO2 on the 10-ky timescale typically considered for storage
   projects.}},

Abstract = {{Ni-catalyst-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)
   operating with H-2 fuel are highly efficient, low-emission,
   electrochemical energy conversion devices. However, the economical
   production of hydrogen is a challenge, and there is immense interest to
   use hydrocarbon fuels directly with SOFC. Unfortunately, the
   solid-carbon generated continuously by hydrocarbon cracking accumulates
   on the Ni-metal surface and leads to rapid decline in performance. We
   show here that 1 atom\% Sn (with respect to Ni) incorporated onto a
   surface-modified Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) cermet anode with extended
   three-phase boundaries, where O2- ions, electrons, and fuels get
   together, acts as an excellent decoking agent. The hydrophilic Sn doped
   on the surface of Ni is hydrated and hydroxylated by reacting with the
   water vapour produced by the electrochemical oxidation of the fuel, and
   the hydroxyl groups aid the oxidation of neighbouring carbon and drive
   off as CO2. Moreover, the enlarged three-phase boundaries of the anode
   allow 02 ions to rapidly reach the deposited carbon as well as the
   hydrocarbon gas and electrochemically oxidize them. With this modified
   Sn/Ni-GDC catalyst anode, GDC electrolyte, and
   La(0.6)Sr(0.4)ACo(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) cathode, more than 200 h of
   operation with a methane-fueled SOFC is demonstrated here.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous, high glass transition, crosslinkable poly(arylene ether)s for
   gas purification membranes have been synthesized. The polymers include a
   moiety capable of several oxidation reactions and UV crosslinking.
   Structural identification was confirmed by H-1 NMR and IR spectroscopy
   and molecular weights were determined by SEC. Two oxidation reactions of
   the polymers were identified, one by chemical treatment using Oxone and
   KBr and one by elevated thermal treatment in air. DSC and TGA were used
   for thermal characterization, and TGA, H-1 NMR and ATR-FTIR revealed the
   progress of the thermal oxidation reactions. Both polymers produced
   tough, ductile films and gas transport properties of the non-crosslinked
   linear polymers and crosslinked polymer are compared. The O-2
   permeability of one exemplary non-crosslinked poly(arylene ether) was
   2.8 Barrer, with an O-2/N-2 selectivity of 5.4. Following UV
   crosslinking, the O-2 permeability decreased to 1.8 Barrer, and the

Abstract = {{Physical aging of both thick and thin films of ``high free-volume{''}
   glassy perfluoropolymers was studied by monitoring changes in pure gas
   permeability of 02, N-2 and CH4. All permeability measurements were done
   at a fixed temperature of 35 C for more than 1000 h of aging. Two grades
   of perfluoropolymers, Teflon AF and Hyflon AD, having different
   comonomer structures but with similar comonomer ratios were studied to
   understand the effect of comonomer type and content on the aging
   behavior. The effect of casting process (solution vs. spin coating) and
   solvent type (vapor pressure and boiling point) had a significant effect
   on the absolute permeability of both thick and thin films; however, the
   aging rates were more affected by thickness and solvent type rather than
   the casting process for similar thicknesses. After 1000 h of aging, the
   relative permeability for thin films of Teflon AF 2400 was decreased by
   27\% compared to only 10\% for thick films prepared from Novec 7500
   solvent. Teflon AF, which has a higher fractional free volume (FFV) than
   Hyflon AD, is believed to undergo significant aging well before the
   initial permeability measurement could be made (after similar to 1 h of
   aging) and, therefore, Teflon AF materials showed a lower decrease in
   relative permeability compared to Hyflon AD for the same aging time. The
   comonomer type and content has a significant effect on the permeability;
   the initial absolute oxygen permeability for AF 2400 was an order of
   magnitude higher compared to AD 60. The physical aging of thin films of
   the various glassy perfluoropolymers was also tracked by recording
   changes in the refractive index and thickness with time by ellipsometry.
   The ellipsometry data also confirmed higher aging rates in Hyflon AD
   compared to Teflon AF materials. The volumetric aging rate, obtained
   from the change in the refractive index using the Lorentz-Lorenz
   equation, and the permeability reduction rate from the (P-1000h/P-1h)
   ratio showed an excellent linear correlation. The (P-1000h/P-1h) ratio
   also showed a stronger correlation with (T-g-35) degrees C than with
   FFV. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) is a good solvent for postcombustion CO2
   capture; however, it is prone to oxidative degradation. The initial test
   conditions mimicked those found in the absorber of a commercial system:
   MEA was degraded in the presence of CO2, with high oxygen mass transfer,
   and with dissolved metals, at absorber temperatures. In later
   experiments, high temperature cycling was incorporated into the
   apparatus to better represent a real system. These cycling results
   suggest that the unadditized 7 m MEA in a real system contacted with 5\%
   oxygen in the absorber and with the stripper operated at 120 degrees C
   would experience close to 5\% amine loss per week. Inhibitors such as
   inhibitor A (Inh A), 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMcT),
   diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA),
   hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid (HEDP), and methyldiethanolamine
   (MDEA) reduced MEA oxidation at low temperature by more than 90\%.
   Results of the screening study also confirmed the reliability of ammonia
   production as an accurate indicator of MEA oxidation under all test
   conditions, allowing for rapid and accurate screening of new additives.
   Unfortunately, none of the additives screened at low temperature
   significantly reduced oxidation with high temperature cycling; thus they
   are not recommended at this point for use in a commercial CO2 capture
   system.}},

Title = {{Specific ion effects on membrane potential and the permselectivity of
   ion exchange membranes}},

Abstract = {{Membrane potential and permselectivity are critical parameters for a
   variety of electrochemically-driven separation and energy technologies.
   An electric potential is developed when a membrane separates electrolyte
   solutions of different concentrations, and a permselective membrane
   allows specific species to be transported while restricting the passage
   of other species. Ion exchange membranes are commonly used in
   applications that require advanced ionic electrolytes and span
   technologies such as alkaline batteries to ammonium bicarbonate reverse
   electrodialysis, but membranes are often only characterized in sodium
   chloride solutions. Our goal in this work was to better understand
   membrane behaviour in aqueous ammonium bicarbonate, which is of interest
   for closed-loop energy generation processes. Here we characterized the
   permselectivity of four commercial ion exchange membranes in aqueous
   solutions of sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and
   ammonium bicarbonate. This stepwise approach, using four different ions
   in aqueous solution, was used to better understand how these specific
   ions affect ion transport in ion exchange membranes. Characterization of
   cation and anion exchange membrane permselectivity, using these ions, is
   discussed from the perspective of the difference in the physical
   chemistry of the hydrated ions, along with an accompanying re-derivation
   and examination of the basic equations that describe membrane potential.
   In general, permselectivity was highest in sodium chloride and lowest in
   ammonium bicarbonate solutions, and the nature of both the counter- and
   co-ions appeared to influence measured permselectivity. The counter-ion
   type influences the binding affinity between counter-ions and polymer
   fixed charge groups, and higher binding affinity between fixed charge
   sites and counter-ions within the membrane decreases the effective
   membrane charge density. As a result permselectivity decreases. The
   charge density and polarizability of the co-ions also appeared to
   influence permselectivity leading to ion-specific effects; co-ions that
   are charge dense and have low polarizability tended to result in high
   membrane permselectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with a unilateral transtibial amputation have a greater risk
   of falling compared to able-bodied individuals, and falling on stairs
   can lead to serious injuries. Individuals with transtibial amputations
   have lost ankle plantarflexor muscle function, which is critical for
   regulating whole-body angular momentum to maintain dynamic balance.
   Recently, powered prostheses have been designed to provide active ankle
   power generation with the goal of restoring biological ankle function.
   However, the effects of using a powered prosthesis on the regulation of
   whole-body angular momentum are unknown. The purpose of this study was
   to use angular momentum to evaluate dynamic balance in individuals with
   a transtibial amputation using powered and passive prostheses relative
   to able-bodied individuals during stair ascent and descent. Ground
   reaction forces, external moment arms, and joint powers were also
   investigated to interpret the angular momentum results. A key result was
   that individuals with an amputation had a larger range of sagittal-plane
   angular momentum during prosthetic limb stance compared to able-bodied
   individuals during stair ascent. There were no significant differences
   in the frontal, transverse, or sagittal-plane ranges of angular momentum
   or maximum magnitude of the angular momentum vector between the passive
   and powered prostheses during stair ascent or descent. These results
   indicate that individuals with an amputation have altered angular
   momentum trajectories during stair walking compared to able-bodied
   individuals, which may contribute to an increased fall risk. The results
   also suggest that a powered prosthesis provides no distinct advantage
   over a passive prosthesis in maintaining dynamic balance during stair
   walking. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With an aim to broaden the understanding of the role of Co3+ in the
   lithium-rich layered oxide cathodes for lithium-ion batteries, the
   influence of composition and synthesis temperature on the oxygen loss,
   reversible capacity, and electrochemical behavior of the xLi(2)MnO(3)-(1
   x)LiCoO2 series in the first cycle has been systematically investigated.
   The charge capacity first increases with increasing x value from 0.2 to
   0.6 due to the enhanced oxygen loss, but then decreases with further
   increase in x from 0.6 to 0.8. Although the discharge capacity shows a
   trend similar to the charge capacity, the maximum value appears at x =
   0.40.5, rather than at x = 0.6 because of its larger irreversible
   capacity loss. Surprisingly, raising the synthesis temperature from 800
   to 1000 degrees C alters the electrochemical behavior of the first
   charge. The materials synthesized at 900 and 1000 degrees C show a
   three-step reaction process consisting of the oxidation of Co3+,
   simultaneous oxidation of Co3+ and O-2, and finally the oxidation of O-2
   only, while those synthesized at 800 degrees C exhibit a two-step
   reaction process composed of Co3+ oxidation and O-2 oxidation occurring
   separately.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design, fabrication and characterization of a compact and
   highly sensitive integrated photonic electromagnetic field sensor based
   on a silicon-organic hybrid modulator driven by a bowtie antenna.
   Slow-light effects in the electrooptic (EO) polymer refilled silicon
   slot photonic crystal waveguide (PCW), together with broadband electric
   field enhancement provided by the bowtie antenna, are utilized to
   enhance the interaction of microwaves and optical waves, enabling an
   ultra large effective in-device EO coefficient over 1000 pm/V and thus a
   high sensitivity. The EO polymer refilled slot PCW is designed for
   low-dispersion slow-light propagation, high poling efficiency, and high
   optical mode confinement inside the slot. The bowtie antenna acts not
   only as a receiving antenna, but also as poling electrodes during the
   fabrication process. A bowtie antenna integrated on doped silicon slot
   PCW is demonstrated to have a broad operational bandwidth, with a
   maximum resonance at the frequency of 10 GHz. The strongly enhanced
   broadband electric field is used to directly modulate the phase of the
   optical waves propagating through the slot PCW embedded inside the feed
   gap of the bowtie antenna. The phase modulation is then converted to
   intensity modulation using an external reference arm to form a
   Mach-Zehnder interferometer in our experimental setup. The sensing of
   electromagnetic field at 8.4 GHz is experimentally demonstrated, with a
   minimum detectable electromagnetic power density of 8.4 mW/m(2),
   corresponding to a minimum detectable electric field of 2.5 V/m.}},

Abstract = {{For over two decades, immunologists and biomaterials scientists have
   co-existed in parallel world with the rationale of understanding the
   molecular profile of immune responses to vaccination, implantation, and
   treating incurable diseases. Much of the field of biomaterial-based
   immunotherapy has relied on evaluating model antigens such as chicken
   egg ovalbumin in mouse models but their relevance to humans has been
   point of much discussion. Nevertheless, such model antigens have
   provided important insights into the mechanisms of immune regulation and
   served as a proof-of-concept for plethora of biomaterial-based vaccines.
   After years of extensive development of numerous biomaterials for
   immunomodulation, it is only recently that an experimental scaffold
   vaccine implanted beneath the skin has begun to use the human model to
   study the immune responses to cancer vaccination by co-delivering
   patient-derived tumor lysates and immunomodulatory proteins. If
   successful, this scaffold vaccine will change the way we approached
   untreatable cancers, but more importantly, will allow a faster and more
   rational translation of therapeutic regimes to other cancers, chronic
   infections, and autoimmune diseases. Most materials reviews have focused
   on immunomodulatory adjuvants and micro-nano-particles. Here we provide
   an insight into emerging hydrogel and scaffold based immunomodulatory
   approaches that continue to demonstrate efficacy against immune
   associated diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear buckling of elastic thin films on compliant substrates is
   studied by modeling and simulations to reveal the roles of pre-strain,
   elastic modulus ratio, and interfacial properties in morphological
   transition from wrinkles to buckle-delamination blisters. The model
   integrates an interfacial cohesive zone model with the Foppl-von Karman
   plate theory and Green function method within the general framework of
   energy minimization. A kinetics approach is developed for numerical
   simulations. Subject to a uniaxial pre-strain, the numerical simulations
   confirm the analytically predicted critical conditions for onset of
   wrinkling and wrinkle-induced delamination, with which a phase diagram
   is constructed. It is found that, with increasing pre-strain, the
   equilibrium configuration evolves from flat to wrinkles, to concomitant
   wrinkles and buckle-delamination, and to an array of parallel straight
   blisters. The height and width of the buckle-delamination blisters can
   be approximately described by a set of scaling laws with respect to the
   pre-strain and interfacial toughness. Subject to an equi-biaxial
   pre-strain, the critical conditions are determined numerically to
   construct a similar phase diagram for the buckling modes. Moreover, by
   varying the pre-strain, modulus ratio, and interfacial toughness, a rich
   variety of equilibrium configurations are simulated, including straight
   blisters, and network blisters with or without wrinkles. These results
   provide considerable insight into diverse surface patterns in layered
   material systems as a result of the mechanical interactions between the
   film and the substrate through their interface, which suggests potential
   control parameters for designing specific surface patterns. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Five membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) with different average sizes
   of platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (2.2, 3.5, 5.0, 6.7, and 11.3 nm) in the
   cathode were analyzed before and after potential cycling (0.6 to 1.0 V,
   50 mV/s) by transmission electron microscopy. Cathodes loaded with 2.2
   and 3.5 nm catalyst nanoparticles exhibit the following changes during
   electrochemical cycling: (i) substantial broadening of the size
   distribution relative to the initial size distribution, (ii) presence of
   coalesced particles within the electrode, and (iii) precipitation of
   submicron-sized particles with complex shapes within the membrane. In
   contrast, cathodes loaded with 5.0, 6.7, and 11.3 nm size catalyst
   nanoparticles are significantly less prone to the aforementioned
   effects. As a result, the electrochemically active surface area (ECA) of
   MEA cathodes loaded with 2.2 and 3.5 nm nanoparticle catalysts degrades
   dramatically within 1000 cycles of operation, while the
   electrochemically active surface area of MEA cathodes loaded with 5.0,
   6.7, and 11.3 nm nanoparticle catalysts appears to be stable even after
   10 000 cycles. The loss in MEA performance for cathodes loaded with 2.2
   and 3.5 run nanoparticle catalysts appears to be due to the loss in
   electrochemically active surface area concomitant with the observed
   morphological changes in these nanoparticle catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{The well-known Leidenfrost effect is the formation of a vapor layer
   between a liquid and an underlying hot surface. This insulating vapor
   layer severely degrades heat transfer and results in surface dryout. We
   measure the heat transfer enhancement and dryout prevention benefits
   accompanying electrostatic suppression of the Leidenfrost state.
   Interfacial electric fields in the vapor layer can attract liquid toward
   the surface and promote wetting. This principle can suppress dryout even
   at ultrahigh temperatures exceeding 500 degrees C, which is more than 8
   times the Leidenfrost superheat for organic solvents. Robust Leidenfrost
   state suppression is observed for a variety of liquids, ranging from low
   electrical conductivity organic solvents to electrically conducting salt
   solutions. Elimination of the vapor layer increases heat dissipation
   capacity by more than 1 order of magnitude. Heat removal capacities
   exceeding 500 W/cm(2) are measured, which is 5 times the critical heat
   flux (CHF) of water on common engineering surfaces. Furthermore, the
   heat transfer rate can be electrically controlled by the applied
   voltage. The underlying science is explained via a multiphysics
   analytical model which captures the coupled electrostatic-fluid-thermal
   transport phenomena underlying electrostatic Leidenfrost state
   suppression. Overall, this work uncovers the physics underlying dryout
   prevention and demonstrates electrically tunable boiling heat transfer
   with ultralow power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Coatings and substrates with topographically patterned features will
   play an important role in efficient technologies for harvesting and

   methodology for prescribing height profiles in polymer films is
   presented here. This is accomplished by photochemcially patterning a
   solid-state, sensitized polymer film. After heating the film above its
   glass transition temperature, melt-state flow is triggered and directed
   by the chemical pattern. A second light exposure was applied to fully
   activate a heat-stable photo-crosslinking additive. The features formed
   here are thermochemically stable and can act as an underlayer in a
   multilayered film. To exemplify this capability, these films were also
   used to direct the macroscopic film morphology of a block copolymer
   overlayer.}},

Abstract = {{The acoustic signatures produced by a full-scale, Bell 430 helicopter
   during steady-level-flight and transient roll-right maneuvers are
   analyzed by way of time-frequency analysis. The roll-right maneuvers
   comprise both a medium and a fast roll rate. Data are acquired using a
   single ground based microphone that are analyzed by way of the Morlet
   wavelet transform to extract the spectral properties and sound pressure
   levels as functions of time. The findings show that during maneuvering
   operations of the helicopter, both the overall sound pressure level and
   the blade-vortex interaction sound pressure level are greatest when the
   roll rate of the vehicle is at its maximum. The reduced inflow in the
   region of the rotor disk where blade-vortex interaction noise originates
   is determined to be the cause of the increase in noise. A local decrease
   in inflow reduces the miss distance of the tip vortex and thereby
   increases the BVI noise signature. Blade loading and advance ratios are
   also investigated as possible mechanisms for increased sound production,
   but are shown to be fairly constant throughout the maneuvers. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Charge/discharge of a room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery
   involves redox processes of a series of long-chain soluble sodium
   polysulfides (Na2Sn, 4 <= n <= 8). By taking advantage of this, a
   room-temperature Na-S battery is developed with dissolved sodium
   polysulfide catholyte and a free-standing, binder-free multiwall carbon
   nanotube (MWCNT) fabric electrode. Use of liquid phase sodium
   polysulfide as a cathode not only provides a facile dispersion and
   homogeneous distribution of the sulfur active material into the
   conductive matrix but also supplies a unique approach to mechanistically
   understand the ambient-temperature Na-S battery system. With the
   intermediate products (polysulfides) as the starting cathode, the
   electrochemical characteristics of the Na-S battery in the lower
   voltage-plateau region can be readily studied without the impact from
   the transformation process of elemental sulfur into long-chain sodium
   polysulfides. The nanostructured free-standing MWCNT fabric electrode in
   this battery system acts as a high-surface current collector. In
   comparison with the traditional solid sulfur-carbon composite cathode,
   the sodium polysulfide/MWCNT fabric cathode provides higher active
   material utilization and capacity retention during cycling.
   Electrochemical studies reveal that the transition of the low-ordered
   sodium polysulfides (or disulfide) is mostly responsible for the
   capacity fade during cycling. Operation of the cells with the
   sulfur/dissolved sodium polysulfide redox couple provides a stable
   output capacity/energy.}},

Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Higher manganese silicides (HMS) made of earth-abundant and non-toxic
   elements are regarded as promising p-type thermoelectric materials
   because their complex crystal structure results in low lattice thermal
   conductivity. It is shown here that the already low thermal conductivity
   of HMS can be reduced further to approach the minimum thermal
   conductivity via partial substitution of Mn with heavier rhenium (Re) to
   increase point defect scattering. The solubility limit of Re in the
   obtained RexMn1-xSi1.8 is determined to be about x = 0.18. Elemental
   inhomogeneity and the formation of ReSi1.75 inclusions with 50-200 nm
   size are found within the HMS matrix. It is found that the power factor
   does not change markedly at low Re content of x <= 0.04 before it drops
   considerably at higher Re contents. Compared to pure HMS, the reduced
   lattice thermal conductivity in RexMn1-xSi1.8 results in a 25\% increase
   of the peak figure of merit ZT to reach 0.57 +/- 0.08 at 800 K for x =
   0.04. The suppressed thermal conductivity in the pure RexMn1-xSi1.8 can
   enable further investigations of the ZT limit of this system by
   exploring different impurity doping strategies to optimize the carrier
   concentration and power factor.}},

   Anodes for Li-Ion Batteries}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional mesoporous TiO2-Sn/C core-shell nanowire arrays are
   prepared on Ti foil as anodes for lithium-ion batteries. Sn formed by a
   reduction of SnO2 is encapsulated into TiO2 nanowires and the carbon
   layer is coated onto it. For additive-free, self-supported anodes in
   Li-ion batteries, this unique core-shell composite structure can
   effectively buffer the volume change, suppress cracking, and improve the
   conductivity of the electrode during the discharge-charge process, thus
   resulting in superior rate capability and excellent long-term cycling
   stability. Specifically, the TiO2-Sn/C nanowire arrays display
   rechargeable discharge capacities of 769, 663, 365, 193, and 90 mA h
   g(-1) at 0.1C, 0.5C, 2C 10C, and 30C, respectively (1C = 335 mA g(-1)).
   Furthermore, the TiO2-Sn/C nanowire arrays exhibit a capacity retention
   rate of 84.8\% with a discharge capacity of over 160 mA h g(-1), even
   after 100 cycles at a high current rate of 10C.}},

Title = {{On the calculation of internal forces in mechanically stressed
   polyatomic molecules}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{We discuss how to define and to compute internal forces in a molecule
   subjected to mechanical stress. Because of the inherently many-body
   character of intramolecular interactions, internal forces cannot be
   uniquely defined without specifying a set of internal coordinates used
   to describe the molecular structure. When such a set is comprised of 3N
   - 6 interactomic distances (N being the number of atoms) and includes
   the bond lengths of interest, we show that the associated forces, while
   satisfying the equation F = partial derivative V/partial derivative R (
   where R is the bond length, F is the internal force in this bond, and V
   is the potential energy of the molecule), can be determined from the
   molecular geometry alone. We illustrate these ideas using several toy
   models ranging from small molecules to a graphene sheet and show that
   the magnitude of the internal force in a bond is not necessarily a good
   predictor of its strength in response to mechanical loading. At the same
   time, analysis of internal forces reveals interesting phenomena such as
   the force multiplication effect, where weak external forces may, e.g.,
   be used to break strong bonds, and offers insight into the catch-bond
   phenomenon where chemical reactivity is suppressed through application
   of a force. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The expected urbanization of the planet in the coming century coupled
   with aging infrastructure in developed regions, increasing complexity of
   man-made systems, and pressing climate change impacts have created
   opportunities for reassessing the role of infrastructure and
   technologies in cities and how they contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. Modern urbanization is predicated on complex, increasingly
   coupled infrastructure systems, and energy use continues to be largely
   met from fossil fuels. Until energy infrastructures evolve away from
   carbon-based fuels, GHG emissions are critically tied to the
   urbanization process. Further complicating the challenge of decoupling
   urban growth from GHG emissions are lock-in effects and
   interdependencies. This paper synthesizes state-of-the-art thinking for
   transportation, fuels, buildings, water, electricity, and waste systems
   and finds that GHG emissions assessments tend to view these systems as
   static and isolated from social and institutional systems. Despite
   significant understanding of methods and technologies for reducing
   infrastructure-related GHG emissions, physical, institutional, and
   cultural constraints continue to work against us, pointing to knowledge
   gaps that must be addressed. This paper identifies three challenge
   themes to improve our understanding of the role of infrastructure and
   technologies in urbanization processes and position these increasingly
   complex systems for low-carbon growth. The challenges emphasize how we
   can reimagine the role of infrastructure in the future and how people,
   institutions, and ecological systems interface with infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of dynamic properties of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is
   essential for seismic response analysis of MSW landfills in areas of
   moderate to high seismicity. A field testing program aimed at
   characterizing the dynamic properties of MSW was executed at two
   locations in a Subtitle D landfill in Austin, Texas. Shear and primary
   wave velocities were measured using small-scale crosshole and downhole
   seismic tests. The combination of these seismic methods allowed an
   assessment of the effect of waste composition on dynamic properties,
   anisotropy, and Poisson's ratio of the MSW. In addition, steady-state
   dynamic testing was performed using two mobile vibroseis shakers to
   evaluate in-situ the nonlinear relationship between shear modulus and
   shearing strain. Horizontal steady-state shaking at increasing stress
   level generated shearing strains from 0.001\% to 0.2\% allowing
   evaluation of shear modulus reduction curves over a wide shearing strain
   range. The effect of confining stress on the dynamic properties of the
   MSW was also evaluated using the substantial weight of the vibroseis as
   reaction to apply surcharge vertical loads at the surface of the MSW.

Title = {{Exploring approaches to improve the performance of autonomous monitoring

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{collect and provide rich information to facilitate decision making
   processes. One of the applications is using location data to support
   autonomous crane safety monitoring (e.g., collision avoidance and
   dangerous areas control). Several location-aware wireless technologies
   such as GPS (Global Positioning System), RFID (Radio-frequency
   identification), and Ultra-Wide Band sensors, have been proposed to
   provide location information for autonomous safety monitoring. However,
   previous studies indicated that imperfections (errors, uncertainty, and
   inconsistency) exist in the data collected from those sensors and the
   data imperfections have great impacts on autonomous safety monitoring
   system performance. This paper explores five computationally
   light-weight approaches to deal with the data imperfections, aiming to
   improve the system performance. The authors built a scaled autonomous
   crane safety monitoring testbed with a mounted localization system to
   collect location data and developed five representative test cases based
   on a live construction jobsite. Seven hundred and sixty location
   readings were collected at thirty-eight test points from the sensors.
   Those location data was fed into the reasoning mechanisms with five
   approaches to generate the safety decisions at those thirty-eight test
   points and evaluate system performance in terms of precision, recall and
   accuracy. The results indicate that system performance can be improved
   if at least ten position readings from sensors can be collected at small
   intervals at any location along the moving path. However, by including
   additional data such as velocity and acceleration that may be read from
   devices mounted on workers, localization error may be significantly
   reduced. These findings represent a path forward to improve localization
   accuracy by mixing imperfect data from the sensed environment with
   supplemental input. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Under technologically relevant oxygen-rich conditions, the reaction
   mechanism of CO oxidation over transition metals can be complicated by
   the formation of oxides. Questions of whether the active surface for CO
   oxidation is a pristine metal, a surface oxide, or a bulk oxide is still
   under active debate. In this study, density functional theory
   calculations are used to model CO oxidation on the Pd(111) surface. Our
   results show that a thin layer of Pd5O4 surface oxide is stable under
   catalytically relevant gas-phase conditions. Three-fold oxygen atoms in
   the surface are found to react with gas-phase CO molecules following an
   Eley-Rideal reaction mechanism. Such CO oxidation reduces the surface
   oxide, but the oxide can be replenished by O-2 dissociation. Kinetic
   analysis shows that experimentally observed reaction conditions, that
   are uninhibited by CO and limited only by mass transfer, correspond to a
   surface oxide phase with CO oxidation occurring though the Eley-Rideal
   mechanism. Under steady-state operating conditions, the continuous
   formation and decomposition of the surface oxide is expected and is key
   to the high CO oxidation rate on Pd(111).}},

Title = {{A Parallel Sparse Direct Solver via Hierarchical DAG Scheduling}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We present a parallel sparse direct solver for multicore architectures
   based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scheduling. Recently, DAG
   scheduling has become popular in advanced Dense Linear Algebra libraries
   due to its efficient asynchronous parallel execution of tasks. However,
   its application to sparse matrix problems is more challenging as it has
   to deal with an enormous number of highly irregular tasks. This
   typically results in substantial scheduling overhead both in time and
   space, which causes overall parallel performance to be suboptimal. We
   describe a parallel solver based on two-level task parallelism: tasks
   are first generated from a parallel tree traversal on the assembly tree;
   next, those tasks are further refined by using algorithms-by-blocks to
   gain fine-grained parallelism. The resulting fine-grained tasks are
   asynchronously executed after their dependencies are analyzed. Our
   approach is distinct from others in that we adopt two-level task
   scheduling to mirror the two-level parallelism. As a result, we reduce
   scheduling overhead, and increase efficiency and flexibility. The
   proposed parallel sparse direct solver is evaluated for the particular
   problems arising from the hp-Finite Element Method where conventional
   sparse direct solvers do not scale well.}},

Abstract = {{In compositional reservoir simulation, a set of non-linear partial
   differential equations must be solved. In this work, two numerical
   formulations are compared. The first formulation is based on an implicit
   pressure and explicit composition (IMPEC) procedure, and the second
   formulation uses an implicit pressure and implicit saturation (IMPSAT).
   The main goal of this work is to compare the formulations in terms of
   computational times for solving 2D and 3D compositional reservoir
   simulation case studies. In the comparison, both UDS (Upwind difference
   scheme) and third order TVD schemes were used. The computational results
   for the aforementioned formulations and the two interpolation functions
   are presented for several case studies involving homogeneous and
   heterogeneous reservoirs. Based on our comparison of IMPEC and IMPSAT
   formulations using several case studies presented in this work, the
   IMPSAT formulation was faster than the IMPEC formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent sustainability research has focused on urban systems given their
   high share of environmental impacts and potential for centralized impact
   mitigation. Recent research emphasizes descriptive statistics from
   place-based case studies to argue for policy action. This limits the
   potential for general insights and decision support. Here, we implement
   generalized linear and multiple linear regression analyses to obtain
   more robust insights on the relationship between urbanization and
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the US We used consistently derived
   county-level scope 1 and scope 2 GHG inventories for our response
   variable while predictor variables included dummy-coded variables for
   county geographic type (central, outlying, and nonmetropolitan), median
   household income, population density, and climate indices (heating
   degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD)). We find that there is
   not enough statistical evidence indicating per capita scope 1 and 2
   emissions differ by geographic type, ceteris paribus. These results are
   robust for different assumed electricity emissions factors. We do find
   statistically significant differences in per capita emissions by sector
   for different county types, with transportation and residential
   emissions highest in nonmetropolitan (rural) counties, transportation
   emissions lowest in central counties, and commercial sector emissions
   highest in central counties. These results indicate the importance of
   regional land use and transportation dynamics when planning local
   emissions mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{We consider downlink transmission in a cellular network consisting of
   multi-antenna base stations (BSs), single-antenna mobile users,
   directional antennas each with a vertically adjustable beam, and control
   signaling delays in feedback and backhaul links. We propose a novel
   transmission technique in which intercell interference management is
   performed via coordinating the beamforming jointly in the horizontal and
   vertical planes of the wireless channel, denoted as coordinated 3D
   beamforming. In the horizontal plane, we focus on intercell interference
   cancelation (ICIC) and investigate its performance when the provided
   channel state information (CSI) is impaired due to delay/mobility. It is
   demonstrated that the superiority of ICIC over conventional intracell
   maximum ratio transmission is highly dependent on the CSI accuracy. In
   the vertical plane, we consider intercell interference control via
   coordinatively adapting the elevation angle of the BS antenna pattern,
   denoted as tilt, to the locations of the scheduled users. It is shown
   that with perfect CSI interference management should be performed in the
   horizontal plane using ICIC, while at high delay/mobility it should be
   done in the vertical plane via coordinated tilt adaptation. For
   intermediate values of delay/mobility, joint interference management in
   both planes is required.}},

Abstract = {{Water-alternating-gas (WAG) floods are designed to lessen the mobility
   of CO2 and thereby increase sweep efficiency. Common factors that often

   This study uses a slate of analytical tools to monitor flood performance
   in miscible and immiscible WAG floods. These tools include the

Abstract = {{The reliability of Pareto-based history matching decreases as the number
   of objective functions increases because the probability that trade-off
   solutions exist in the non-optimal domain increases exponentially. This
   study developed an evolutionary algorithm to overcome inefficiency of
   the objective constraint by introducing preference-ordering and
   successive objective reduction to the conventional multi-objective
   optimization module. The former enhances the convergence speed towards
   the Pareto-optimal front by pruning any unqualified geomodels, and the
   latter improves the optimization efficiency by excluding redundant
   production data from the fitness evaluation. This integrated model
   consistently reduced the data mismatch between the observed and
   calculated production, so that overcame the divergence problem in
   multi-objective optimization as well as the scale-dependency problem in
   single-objective optimization. This calibration process predicted the
   future performance better than the typical optimization schemes from
   equiprobable geomodels, preserving the diversity of feasible solutions,
   thereby assessing uncertainties in production forecasts for both the
   field and wells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Investigation of the Critical Velocity Required for a Gravity-Stable
   Surfactant Flood}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{931-942}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Classical stability theory predicts the critical velocity for a miscible
   fluid to be stabilized by gravity forces. This theory was tested for
   surfactant floods with ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) and was found
   to be optimistic compared with both laboratory displacement experiments
   and fine-grid simulations. The inaccurate prediction of instabilities on
   the basis of available analytical models is because of the complex
   physics of surfactant floods. First, we simulated vertical sandpack
   experiments to validate the numerical model. Then, we performed
   systematic numerical simulations in two and three dimensions to predict
   formation of instabilities in surfactant floods and to determine the
   velocity required to prevent instabilities by taking advantage of
   buoyancy. The 3D numerical grid was refined until the numerical results
   converged. A third-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD)
   finite-difference method was used for these simulations. We investigated
   the effects of dispersion, heterogeneity, oil viscosity, relative
   permeability, and microemulsion viscosity. These results indicate that
   it is possible to design a very efficient surfactant flood without any
   mobility control if the surfactant solution is injected at a low
   velocity in horizontal wells at the bottom of the geological zone and
   the oil is captured in horizontal wells at the top of the zone. This
   approach is practical only if the vertical permeability of the
   geological zone is high. These experiments and simulations have provided
   new insight into how a gravity-stable, low-tension displacement behaves
   and in particular the importance of the microemulsion phase and its
   properties, especially its viscosity. Numerical simulations show high
   oil-recovery efficiencies on the order of 60\% of waterflood residual
   oil saturation (ROS) for gravity-stable surfactant floods by use of
   horizontal wells. Thus, under favorable reservoir conditions,
   gravity-stable surfactant floods are very attractive alternatives to
   surfactant/polymer floods. Some of the world's largest oil reservoirs
   are deep, high-temperature, high-permeability, light-oil reservoirs, and
   thus candidates for gravity-stable surfactant floods.}},

Title = {{Proppant Placement Using Alternate-Slug Fracturing}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{974-985}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{New fracturing techniques, such as hybrid fracturing (Sharma et al.
   2004), reverse-hybrid fracturing (Liu et al. 2007), and channel (HiWAY)
   fracturing (Gillard et al. 2010), have been deployed over the past few
   years to effectively place proppant in fractures. The goal of these
   methods is to increase the conductivity in the proppant pack, providing
   highly conductive paths for hydrocarbons to flow from the reservoir to
   the wellbore. This paper presents an experimental study on proppant
   placement by use of a new method of fracturing, referred to as
   alternate-slug fracturing. The method involves an alternate injection of
   low-viscosity and high-viscosity fluids, with proppant carried by the
   low-viscosity fluid. Alternate-slug fracturing ensures a deeper
   placement of proppant through two primary mechanisms: (i) proppant
   transport in viscous fingers, formed by the low-viscosity fluid, and
   (ii) an increase in drag force in the polymer slug, leading to better
   entrainment and displacement of any proppant banks that may have formed.
   Both these effects lead to longer propped-fracture length and better
   vertical placement of proppant in the fracture. In addition, the method
   offers lower polymer costs, lower pumping horsepower, smaller fracture
   widths, better control of fluid leak-off, less risk of tip screenouts,
   and less gel damage compared with conventional gel fracture treatments.
   Experiments are conducted in simulated fractures (slot cells) with
   fluids of different viscosity, with proppant being carried by the
   low-viscosity fluid. It is shown that viscous fingers of low-viscosity
   fluid and viscous sweeps by the high-viscosity fluid lead to a deeper
   placement of proppant. Experiments are also conducted to demonstrate
   slickwater fracturing, hybrid fracturing, and reverse-hybrid fracturing.
   Comparison shows that alternate-slug fracturing leads to the deepest and
   most-uniform placement of proppant inside the fracture. Experiments are
   also conducted to study the mixing of fluids over a wide range of
   viscosity ratios. Data are presented to show that the finger velocities
   and mixing-zone velocities increase with viscosity ratio up to viscosity
   ratios of approximately 350. However, at higher viscosity ratios, the
   velocities plateau, signifying no further effect of viscosity contrast
   on the growth of fingers and mixing zone. The data are an integral part
   of design calculations for alternate-slug-fracturing treatments.}},

Title = {{A dynamical system model of eco-geomorphic response to landslide
   disturbance}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{8216-8226}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Vegetated landscapes form through the interactions of ecologic and
   geomorphic processes. These interactions are generally slow and steady,
   but they are occasionally the subject of abrupt disturbance. In humid
   uplands, for example, landslides episodically disrupt forest growth and
   regolith development, suddenly mobilize soil, regolith and bedrock, and
   facilitate runoff-driven erosion by abruptly removing canopy protection
   over a wide area. Here we model such an environment as a stochastically
   perturbed dynamical system whose simplified low dimensionality makes its
   eco-geomorphic interactions easier to explore and understand. The model
   captures some of the spatial variability across a catchment by treating
   an ensemble of subcatchments: in each, aggregated biomass and regolith
   coevolve as a two-dimensional dynamical system subject to episodic
   disturbance by slope failure. This coevolution gives rise to a notional
   stable equilibrium between regolith and biomass, but one that is not
   achieved in practice where landslide disturbance is significant.
   Instead, a catchment-scale, ensemble-average state arises in which
   higher storm frequency entails thinner regolith, less biomass, and
   weaker canopy protection against runoff erosion. The model makes the
   counter-intuitive prediction that, as rainfall-triggered landslides
   become more frequent, their contribution to the erosion of weathered
   bedrock will diminish as the role from storm runoff erosion rises. In
   some environments apparently dominated by landsliding, the model
   predicts that runoff erosion may be more important in the removal of
   regolith and fine sediment from hillslopes than mass wasting.

Abstract = {{Shale gas formations exhibit strong mechanical and strength
   anisotropies. Thus, it is necessary to study the effect of anisotropy on
   the hydraulic fracture initiation pressure. The calculation model for
   the in-situ stress of the bedding formation is improved according to the
   effective stress theory. An analytical model of the stresses around
   wellbore in shale gas reservoirs, in consideration of stratum dip
   direction, dip angle, and in-situ stress azimuth, has been built.
   Besides, this work established a calculation model for the stress around
   the perforation holes. In combination with the tensile failure
   criterion, a prediction model for the hydraulic fracture initiation
   pressure in the shale gas reservoirs is put forward. The error between
   the prediction result and the measured value for the shale gas reservoir
   in the southern Sichuan Province is only 3.5\%. Specifically, effects of
   factors including elasticity modulus, Poisson's ratio, in-situ stress
   ratio, tensile strength, perforation angle (the angle between
   perforation direction and the maximum principal stress) of anisotropic
   formations on hydraulic fracture initiation pressure have been
   investigated. The perforation angle has the largest effect on the
   fracture initiation pressure, followed by the in-situ stress ratio,
   ratio of tensile strength to pore pressure, and the anisotropy ratio of
   elasticity moduli as the last. The effect of the anisotropy ratio of the
   Poisson's ratio on the fracture initiation pressure can be ignored. This
   study provides a reference for the hydraulic fracturing design in shale
   gas wells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to synthesize prefix graph
   structures that yield adders with the best performance-area trade-off.
   For designing a parallel prefix adder of a given bit-width, our approach
   generates prefix graph structures to optimize an objective function such
   as size of prefix graph subject to constraints like bit-wise output
   logic level. Given bit-width n and level (L) restriction, our algorithm
   excels the existing algorithms in minimizing the size of the prefix
   graph. We also prove its size-optimality when n is a power of two and L
   = log(2) n. Besides prefix graph size optimization and having the best
   performance-area trade-off, our approach, unlike existing techniques,
   can 1) handle more complex constraints such as maximum node fanout or
   wire-length that impact the performance/area of a design and 2) generate
   several feasible solutions that minimize the objective function.
   Generating several sizeoptimal solutions provides the option to choose
   adder designs that mitigate constraints such as wire congestion or power
   consumption that are difficult to model as constraints during logic
   synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves
   performance by 3\% and area by 9\% over even a 64-bit full custom
   designed adder implemented in an industrial high-performance design.}},

Abstract = {{A gas-fed capillary plasma source has been developed to study
   plasma-surface interactions under pulsed high pressure arc conditions,
   without the use of an exploding fuse wire or ablative liner. A
   nonintrusive preionization source has been developed to break down
   relatively large interelectrode gaps at low charge voltages of 2-6 kV.
   The preionization source comprises a nonequilibrium surface streamer
   discharge that forms a conducting channel through which the main thermal
   arc discharge is initiated. The arc electron temperature and number
   density are estimated to be T-e similar to 1-2 eV and n(e) similar to
   10(23) m(-3). Silicon and sapphire samples were exposed to the arc
   plasma and revealed deposition of electrode and wall materials.
   Substitution of Elkonite 50W3 for brass electrodes reduced plasma
   contamination to acceptable levels. The plasma-material interactions
   were examined and quantified using scanning electron microscopy and
   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-air batteries have become appealing in recent years, but one of
   the major challenges is the large overpotential associated with the
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
   Tremendous efforts have been made on developing highly active and
   durable catalysts to lower the overpotentials for ORR and OER. In
   addition to the intrinsic activity and stability of the catalysts,
   construction of the air electrodes plays an important role in the
   overall performance of the air electrodes. Accordingly, three kinds of
   electrode configurations are herein compared: single, combined, and
   decoupled bifunctional air electrodes. The decoupled design of the air
   electrodes shows the best performance in terms of both the discharge and
   charge performance compared to the other configurations. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Two-point statistics are presented for a new direct simulation of the
   zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer in the range Reo =
   2780-6680, and compared with channels in the same range of Reynolds
   numbers, 8+ 1000-2000. Threedimensional spatial correlations are
   investigated in very long domains to educe the average structure of the
   velocity and pressure fluctuations. The streamwise velocity component is
   found to be coherent over longer distances in channels than in boundary
   layers, especially in the direction of the flow. For weakly correlated
   structures, the maximum streamwise length is O(7(S) for boundary layers
   and O(18(S) for channels, attained at the logarithmic and outer regions,
   respectively. The corresponding lengths for the spanwise and wall-normal
   velocities and for the pressure are shorter, O(8-28). The correlations
   are shown to be inclined to the wall at angles that depend on the
   distance from the wall, on the variable being considered, and on the
   correlation level used to define them. All these features change little
   between the two types of flows. Most the above features are also
   approximately independent of the Reynolds number, except for the
   pressure, and for the streamwise velocity structures in the channel.
   Further insight into the flow is provided by correlations conditioned on
   the intensity of the perturbations at the reference point, or on their
   sign. The statistics of the new simulation are available in our website.

Abstract = {{Unsupervised models can provide supplementary soft constraints to help
   classify new ``target{''} data because similar instances in the target
   set are more likely to share the same class label. Such models can also
   help detect possible differences between training and target
   distributions, which is useful in applications where concept drift may
   take place, as in transfer learning settings. This article describes a
   general optimization framework that takes as input class membership
   estimates from existing classifiers learned on previously encountered
   ``source{''} (or training) data, as well as a similarity matrix from a
   cluster ensemble operating solely on the target (or test) data to be
   classified, and yields a consensus labeling of the target data. More
   precisely, the application settings considered are nontransductive
   semisupervised and transfer learning scenarios where the training data
   are used only to build an ensemble of classifiers and are subsequently
   discarded before classifying the target data. The framework admits a
   wide range of loss functions and classification/clustering methods. It
   exploits properties of Bregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre
   duality to yield a principled and scalable approach. A variety of
   experiments show that the proposed framework can yield results
   substantially superior to those provided by naively applying classifiers
   learned on the original task to the target data. In addition, we show
   that the proposed approach, even not being conceptually transductive,
   can provide better results compared to some popular transductive

Abstract = {{NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs), which use few-atom DNA-templated silver
   clusters as reporters, are a type of activatable molecular probes that
   are low-cost and easy to prepare. While NCBs provide a high fluorescence
   enhancement ratio upon activation, their activation colors are currently
   limited. Here we report a simple method to design NCBs with
   complementary emission colors, creating a set of multicolor probes for
   homogeneous, separation-free detection. By systematically altering the
   position and the number of cytosines in the cluster-nucleation sequence,
   we have tuned the activation colors of NCBs to green (C8-8, 460 nm/555
   nm); yellow (C5-5, 525 nm/585 nm); red (C3-4, 580 nm/635 nm); and
   near-infrared (C3-3, 645 nm/695 nm). At the same NCB concentration, the
   activated yellow NCB (C5-5) was found to be 1.3 times brighter than the
   traditional red NCB (C3-4). Three of the four colors (green, yellow, and
   red) were relatively spectrally pure. We also found that subtle changes
   in the linker sequence (down to the single-nucleotide level) could
   significantly alter the emission spectrum pattern of an NCB. When the
   length of linker sequences was increased, the emission peaks were found
   to migrate in a periodic fashion, suggesting short-range interactions
   between silver clusters and nucleobases. Size exclusion chromatography
   results indicated that the activated NCBs are more compact than their
   native duplex forms. Our findings demonstrate the unique photophysical
   properties and environmental sensitivities of few-atom DNA-templated
   silver clusters, which are not seen before in common organic dyes or
   luminescent crystals.}},

Abstract = {{The largest applications of high-performance graphene will likely be
   realized when combined with ubiquitous Si very large scale integrated
   (VLSI) technology, affording a new portfolio of ``back end of the
   line{''} devices including graphene radio frequency transistors, heat
   and transparent conductors, interconnects, mechanical actuators,
   sensors, and optical devices. To this end, we investigate the scalable
   growth of polycrystalline graphene through chemical vapor deposition
   (CVD) and its integration with Si VLSI technology. The large-area Raman
   mapping on CVD polycrystalline graphene on 150 and 300 mm wafers reveals
   >95\% monolayer uniformity with negligible defects. About 26?000
   graphene field-effect transistors were realized, and statistical
   evaluation indicates a device yield of similar to 74\% is achieved, 20\%
   higher than previous reports. About 18\% of devices show mobility of
   >3000 cm(2)/(V s), more than 3 times higher than prior results obtained
   over the same range from CVD polycrystalline graphene. The peak mobility
   observed here is similar to 40\% higher than the peak mobility values
   reported for single-crystalline graphene, a major advancement for
   polycrystalline graphene that can be readily manufactured. Intrinsic
   graphene features such as soft current saturation and three-region
   output characteristics at high field have also been observed on
   wafer-scale CVD graphene on which frequency doubler and amplifiers are
   demonstrated as well. Our growth and transport results on scalable CVD
   graphene have enabled 300 mm synthesis instrumentation that is now
   commercially available.}},

Abstract = {{The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard 61400-1 for
   the design of wind turbines does not explicitly address site-specific
   conditions associated with anomalous atmospheric events or conditions.
   Examples of off-standard atmospheric conditions include thunderstorm
   downbursts, hurricanes, tornadoes, low-level jets, etc. The simulation
   of thunderstorm downbursts and associated loads on a utility-scale wind
   turbine is the focus of this study. Since the problem has not received
   sufficient attention, especially in terms of design, we thus focus in
   this paper on practical aspects. A wind field model that incorporates
   component non-turbulent and turbulent parts is described and employed in
   inflow simulations. The non-turbulent part is based on an available
   analytical model with some modifications, while the turbulent part is
   simulated as a stochastic process using standard turbulence power
   spectral density functions and coherence functions whose defining
   parameters are related to the downburst characteristics such as the
   storm translation velocity. Available information on recorded downbursts
   is used to define two storm scenarios that are studied. Rotor loads are
   generated using stochastic simulation of the aeroelastic response of a
   model of a utility-scale 5-MW turbine. An illustrative single storm
   simulation and the associated turbine response are used to discuss load
   characteristics and to highlight storm-related and environmental
   parameters of interest. Extensive simulations for two downbursts are
   then conducted while varying the storm's location and track relative to
   the turbine. Results suggest that wind turbine yaw and pitch control
   systems clearly influence overall system response. Results also
   highlight the important effects of both the turbulence as well as the
   downburst mean wind profiles on turbine extreme loads.}},

Abstract = {{High-angle (HA) and horizontal (HZ) wells are drilled to maximize
   reservoir exposure, hence improve hydrocarbon production. Because
   attaining the desired well-placement targets while drilling is
   challenging, HA/HZ wells commonly traverse multiple bed boundaries,
   including pay and nonpay reservoir zones. Therefore, the borehole
   measurements simultaneously respond to multiple and heterogeneous layer
   properties, thus giving rise to challenging well-log features such as
   resistivity polarization horns, anisotropy in apparent resistivity, and
   ``bull's-eye{''} features on nuclear-log borehole images. It is for
   these reasons that conventional well-log interpretation methods
   developed for vertical wells often produce unreliable petrophysical
   results in HA/HZ wells.
   Using field examples, we document the application of inversion-based
   interpretation and highlight the advantages of joint petrophysical
   inversion of nuclear and resistivity measurements in HA/HZ wells. The
   examples show that conventional interpretation intuition often developed
   in vertical wells may be inappropriate in HA/HZ wells because of bed
   geometry, shoulder beds, well trajectory, and differing
   volume-of-investigation (VOI) effects. Results indicate that estimated
   hydrocarbon pore volume (HPV) using conventional petrophysical analysis
   can yield errors as high as 10\%.
   We show that inversion-based interpretation is a viable method to
   emphasize sensitivity to petrophysical properties, including electrical
   anisotropy, interpreted from LWD measurements acquired in HA/HZ wells.
   This is especially significant across thinly bedded formations, where
   formation layering is below the spatial resolution of the measurements
   and shoulder-bed effects mask the detection of hydrocarbon sweet spots
   from array propagation-resistivity logs. In the examples, variations in
   water saturation influenced by reservoir quality become conspicuous only
   after applying the inversion-based interpretation method. Subsequently,
   assessment of reservoir HPV improves the diagnosis of pay and nonpay
   reservoir zones.}},

Abstract = {{The production and use of renewable fuels in the transport sector are
   rapidly increasing. Renewable fuel standard (RFS) is a strong regulatory
   component and quantitative policy expected to have a significant market
   impact. In Korea, RFS implementation was agreed upon in July 2013 and
   will be enforced beginning in July 2015. Drivers' acceptance is the most
   important consideration for RFS introduction and sustainable
   implementation. This study analyzed Korean customer preferences for RFS
   and quantified their acceptance level according to policy design. A
   choice experiment was analyzed with a mixed logit model to reflect the
   heterogeneity of respondents' preferences. Respondents were relatively
   sensitive to the price increase, while other attributes had little
   effect on acceptance of RFS. Differences between the influences of
   attributes on drivers' acceptance should be considered when designing
   RFS implementation. Furthermore, it is recommended that the price of
   transportation fuels should be limited to an increase between KRW 10 and
   20/liter (USD 8.879 x 10(-3) and 1.776 x 10(-2)/liter) to ensure high
   acceptance level, secure a budget for infrastructure, and achieve

Abstract = {{Ablation Outcome in Silent Longstanding Persistent AF
   BackgroundImpact of catheter ablation on exercise performance, quality
   of life (QoL) and symptom perception in asymptomatic longstanding
   persistent AF (LSP-AF) patients has not been reported yet.
   Methods and ResultsSixty-one consecutive patients (mean age 62 13 years,
   71\% males) with asymptomatic LSP-AF undergoing first catheter ablation
   were enrolled. Extended pulmonary vein antrum isolation plus ablation of
   complex fractionated atrial electrograms and nonpulmonary vein triggers
   was performed in all. QoL survey was taken at baseline and 12-months
   postablation, using Short Form-36 (SF-36). Information on arrhythmia
   perception was obtained using a standard questionnaire and corroborating
   symptoms with documented evidence of arrhythmia. Exercise tests were
   performed on 38 patients at baseline and 5 months after procedure.
   Recurrence was assessed using event recorder, cardiology evaluation,
   electrocardiogram, and 7-day holter monitoring. After 20 +/- 5 months
   follow-up, 36 (57\%) patients remained recurrence-free off-AAD. Of the
   25 patients experiencing recurrence, 21 (84\%) were symptomatic.
   Compared to baseline, follow-up SF-36 scores improved significantly in
   many measures. For patients with successful ablation, physical component
   summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) demonstrated
   substantial improvement (MCS: 64.2 +/- 22.3 to 70.1 +/- 18.6 {[}P =
   0.041]; PCS: 62.6 +/- 18.4 to 70.0 +/- 14.4 {[}P = 0.032]). Postablation
   exercise study in recurrence-free patients showed significant reduction
   in resting and peak heart rate (75 +/- 11 vs. 90 +/- 17 and 132 +/- 20
   vs. 154.5 +/- 36, respectively, P < 0.001), increase in peak oxygen
   pulse (13.4 +/- 3 vs. 18.9 +/- 16 mL/beat, 5.5 +/- 15, P = 0.001), peak
   VO2/kg (19.7 +/- 5 to 23.4 +/- 13 mL/kg/min {[} 3.7 +/- 10, P = 0.043]),
   and corresponding MET (5.6 +/- 1 to 6.7 +/- 4 {[}1.1 +/- 3, P = 0.03]).
   No improvement was observed in patients with failed procedures.
   ConclusionSuccessful ablation improves exercise performance and QoL in
   asymptomatic LSP-AF patients.}},

Abstract = {{The installation of smart meters has provided an opportunity to better
   analyze residential energy consumption and energy-related behaviors.
   Air-conditioning (A/C) use can be determined through non-intrusive load
   monitoring, which separates A/C cooling energy consumption from
   whole-house energy data. In this paper, a disaggregation technique is
   described and executed on 1-mM smart meter data from 88 houses in
   Austin, TX, USA, from July 2012 through June 2013. Nineteen houses were
   sub-metered to validate the accuracy of the disaggregation technique.
   The R-2 value between the predicted and actual A/C energy use for the 19
   houses was 0.90. The algorithm was then applied to all houses. On
   average, daily energy use from A/C increased by 25 +/- 11 kWh between a
   mild temperature day of 15.5 degrees C (60 degrees F) and a hotter day
   of 31.5 degrees C (89 degrees F), with an 11 kWh increase just during
   peak hours (14:00-20:00). Average time operated, number of cycles, and
   A/C fraction of energy were found to increase linearly with outdoor
   temperature up to 25 degrees C (77 degrees F); a plateau was detected at
   higher temperatures. The accuracy of A/C disaggregation on 5-min data
   was found to be comparable to 1-min data. However, 15-min data did not
   yield accurate results due to insufficient granularity. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Antenna beamwidth is a critical parameter that dictates the performance
   of a radar system. For a microstrip leaky wave antenna (MLWA) to achieve
   a narrow beam, it requires not only a long aperture, but also a small
   attenuation constant. In this paper, a two-section MLWA is proposed to
   achieve a small attenuation constant. The complex propagation constant
   of the proposed structure is first derived using the transverse
   resonance method (TRM). An antenna cross section is then designed using
   TRM and a short prototype is built and measured. It is shown that the
   resulting complex propagation constant agrees well with that calculated
   using TRM. Next, the antenna design is extended to a long aperture to
   demonstrate its narrow-beam performance based on full-wave simulation.
   Finally, the implications of employing a narrow-beam MLWA for radar
   applications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-mode fracture presents spectacular, scale-independent, pattern
   formation in nature and engineering applications. The criteria for crack
   initiation and growth under such mixed mode loading, however, are not
   well established. This work is aimed at exploring the failure criteria
   and the pattern formation under combined modes I and III. Specific
   designs of specimens based on boundary element simulations are
   considered with the aim of examining crack path selection at nucleation,
   threshold behavior of crack front fragmentation and, spacing of
   fragmentation. Experimental investigations with these specially designed
   geometries show that there does not exist a threshold ratio of
   K-III(infinity)/K-I(infinity) below which a crack will propagate
   smoothly without fragmenting into facets. The crack front is shown to
   fragment immediately as soon as it is perturbed by a small amplitude
   mode III loading. The experimental results show further that spacing of
   the fragmentation is set not by any intrinsic length scale of the
   material, but by the characteristic dimension of the driving crack and
   the global loading.}},

Abstract = {{This analysis considers the effect of the placement (azimuth and tilt)
   of fixed solar PV systems on their total energy production, peak power
   production, and economic value given local solar radiation, weather, and
   electricity market prices and rate structures. This analysis details a
   model that was used to calculate the output of solar PV systems across a
   range of azimuths and tilts to find the energetically and economically
   optimal placement. The result of this method, which concludes that the
   optimal placement can vary with a multitude of conditions, challenges
   the default due-south placement that is conventional for typical
   installations. We found that for Austin, TX the optimal azimuth to
   maximize energy production is about 187-188 degrees, or 7-8 degrees west
   of south, while the optimal azimuth to maximize economic output based on
   the value of the solar energy produced is about 200-231 degrees or 20-51
   degrees west of south. The differences between due south (which is the
   conventional orientation) and the optimal placement were on the order of
   1-7\%. Solar PV arrays that are not constrained on their placement, such
   as ground mounted arrays, could possibly increase overall production or
   the value of that production at no additional installation cost by a
   slight rotation from the traditional orientation of due south. The model
   is then extended to consider 1020 locations across the United States
   that have Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data to provide a spatial
   view of optimal solar placements across the country. For the rest of the
   US we found that for most locations the energetically optimal solar PV
   azimuth is within 10 of south. Considering the temporal value of the
   solar energy produced from spatially-resolved market conditions derived
   from local time-of-use rates, the optimal placement shifts to a
   west-of-south azimuth in attempt to align solar energy production with
   higher afternoon prices and higher grid stress times. There are some
   locations particularly on the west coast that have west-of-south energy
   optimal placements, possibly due to typical morning clouds or fog.
   Further solar considerations, such as maximum peak alignment also have
   the potential to influence solar placement. These results have the
   potential to be significant for solar PV installations: utilities might
   alter rate structures to encourage solar generation that is more
   coincident with peak demand, utilities might also use west-of-south
   solar placements as a hedge against future wholesale electricity price
   volatility, building codes might encourage buildings to match roof
   azimuths with local optimal solar PV generation placements, and
   calculations of the true value of solar in optimal and non-optimal
   placements can be more accurate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Dynamic optimization of a hybrid solar thermal and fossil fuel system}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{210-218}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This work illustrates the synergy that exists between solar thermal and
   fossil fuel energy systems. By adding degrees of freedom and optimizing
   the system, more solar energy can be harvested by operating in a
   ``hybrid{''} mode, where a portion of the demand is met by solar energy,
   with the remainder provided by a supplemental fuel, such as natural gas.
   This requires allowing temperatures in the solar field and storage tanks
   to vary, permitting the system to meet the demand by a combination of
   solar and fossil energy, rather than one or the other, and by allowing
   the heat transfer fluid to bypass storage. The addition of thermal
   energy storage provides the opportunity for dynamic optimization, where
   the degrees of freedom can be exploited over the entire time horizon to
   yield optimal results: maximizing the total amount of solar energy
   harvested. The problem is solved using a simultaneous solution method
   that concurrently minimizes the objective function and solves the
   system's constraints. This methodology is demonstrated on a parabolic
   trough solar thermal plant with a two-tank-direct thermal energy storage
   system. Results show that 9\% more solar energy can be harvested on a
   sunny day by using this methodology. On a day with intermittent
   sunlight, 49\% more solar energy can be harvested with the same system.
   Dynamic optimization enables more cost effective solar integration in
   areas with lower or intermittent sources of solar incidence. (C) 2014

   distribution of radiation transmitted through homogenous cloud cover}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{592-601}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the transmission of solar radiation through clouds is
   critical to forecasting the performance of solar power systems. The
   interaction of solar radiation with cloud particles is described by Mie
   scattering and the subsequent radiation transport equations must be
   solved numerically. A standard implementation is typically done using a
   discrete ordinates or Monte Carlo approach, both of which can be
   computationally expensive. An alternate approach, called the
   doubling-method, approximates a cloud as being comprised of optically
   thin layers for which transmission and reflection functions can be
   formulated. A thick cloud is then modeled by stacking the layers in such
   a way that the reflection and transmission from one layer act as inputs
   to the layers above and below it. The approach allows for rapid
   computation of the direct and diffuse components of surface solar
   radiation as a function of solar zenith angle, wavelength, and cloud
   optical thickness. Here we present a simple, platform independent, fully
   benchmarked, algorithm for implementing the doubling-method. The code
   runs orders of magnitude faster than does DISORT for an equivalent
   angular resolution and is shown to produce equivalent results. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Metastases rather than primary tumors are responsible for killing most
   patients with cancer. Cancer cells often invade regional lymph nodes
   (LN) before colonizing other parts of the body. However, due to the low
   sensitivity and specificity of current imaging methods to detect
   localized nodal spread, an invasive surgical procedure-sentinel LN
   biopsy-is generally used to identify metastatic cancer cells. Here, we
   introduce a new approach for more sensitive in vivo detection of LN
   micrometastases, based on the use of ultrasound-guided spectroscopic
   photoacoustic (sPA) imaging of molecularly activated plasmonic
   nanosensors (MAPS). Using a metastatic murine model of oral squamous
   cell carcinoma, we showed that MAPS targeted to the epidermal growth
   factor receptor shifted their optical absorption spectrum to the
   red-near-infrared region after specific interactions with nodal
   metastatic cells, enabling their noninvasive detection by sPA. Notably,
   LN metastases as small as 50 mu m were detected at centimeter-depth
   range with high sensitivity and specificity. Large sPA signals appeared
   in metastatic LN within 30 minutes of MAPS injection, in support of the
   clinical utility of this method. Our findings offer a rapid and
   effective tool to noninvasively identify micrometastases as an alternate
   to sentinal node biopsy analysis. (C)2014 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional analog and mixed-signal production testing of
   system-on-a-chip systems provides limited controllability and
   observability because automatic test equipment (ATE) access is limited
   to device under test (DUT) ballouts. More importantly, production
   mixed-signal testing, due to long test times and expensive ATE,
   represents a substantial portion of the total manufacturing costs. This
   brief presents a cost-effective and advanced-signature-based dynamic
   test method that uses a built-in self-test (BIST) platform that enhances
   the controllability and observability of mixed-signal embedded systems.
   The BIST platform includes a simple on-chip signature generator that
   comprises a clipper and a single-bit comparator. This brief precisely
   predicts the dynamic nonlinearity of individual mixed-signal circuits
   connected in a loopback configuration by clipping the loopback-path
   signal to efficiently give the loopback response a different weighting.
   The clipped behavior of the loopback-path signal is translated to a
   bitstream signature by the comparator. The signature and the loopback
   response allow us to efficiently split the loopback performance into
   individual DUT performances by solving the DUT characteristic equations
   using the on-chip digital-signal-processor core. Hardware measurements
   were performed to show that the proposed method can be practically
   applied in production.}},

Abstract = {{Optical grating-based interferometric sensors have been the subject of
   prior investigations, with recent work focused on micromachined
   microphone applications. The silicon structure is similar in
   construction to capacitive microelectromechanical-system microphones,
   with the exception that the microphone backplate contains an
   optical-diffraction grating at the center. The grating serves as a beam
   splitter in this system, allowing only a portion of the incident light
   to pass to the diaphragm and back, enabling interferometric readout of
   diaphragm displacements. A cited advantage of this system is the ability
   to design highly perforated backplates with low mechanical damping and
   with the ability to realize low thermal-mechanical noise. Grating
   backplates, however, have their own unique optical design constraints
   different from capacitive sensors. This paper details a rigorous finite
   element computational fluid dynamics model for flow resistance of a
   grating backplate. The model is validated for a case study backplate
   fabricated in the epitaxial layer of a 2-mu m silicon-on-insulator
   wafer. The dynamics of the backplate are studied in isolation from other
   microphone elements by mounting the backplate in close proximity to a
   rigid optical-reflector and using electrostatic actuation to vibrate the
   backplate for extraction of compliance, resonance frequency, and quality
   factor. {[}2013-0290]}},

Abstract = {{We present a fluorescence two-photon laser scanning microscope that uses
   a soft-magnetic stainless steel microscanner to generate a 2-D Lissajous
   scanning pattern. The wide-scanning low-voltage driven gimbaled
   torsional stainless steel microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) scanner
   is designed and then fabricated using electrical discharge machining.
   This technology offers unique advantages by allowing larger mirror
   surface areas (4 mm x 5 mm) to enhance the fluorescence collection
   efficiency at low incoming signal level, and providing a rapid
   prototyping and low-cost alternative to silicon-based MEMS devices,
   particularly when large displacements and large field of view are
   required. A maximum total optical scan angle (TOSA) of 20.6 degrees at
   112 Hz for a drive power of 200 mW is required for the slow-scan
   movement, whereas the fast-scan movement occurs at the resonance
   frequency of 1268 Hz and has a TOSA of 26.6 degrees using a drive power
   of 400 mW. The soft-magnetic microscanner incorporated in the two-photon
   hyperspectral fluorescence microscope demonstrates its applicability in
   two-photon hyperspectral imaging of circulating cancer cells, stem

Abstract = {{Decision analysis can help breast reconstruction patients and their
   surgeons to methodically evaluate clinical alternatives and make hard
   decisions. The purpose of this article is to help plastic surgeons guide
   patients in making decisions though a case study in breast
   reconstruction. By making good decisions, patient outcomes may be
   improved. This article aims to illustrate decision analysis techniques
   from the patient perspective, with an emphasis on her values and
   preferences. The authors introduce normative decision-making through a
   fictional breast reconstruction patient and systematically build the
   decision basis to help her make a good decision. The authors broadly
   identify alternatives of breast reconstruction, propose types of
   outcomes that the patient should consider, discuss sources of
   probabilistic information and outcome values, and demonstrate how to
   make a good decision. The concepts presented here may be extended to
   other shared decision-making problems in plastic and reconstructive

   test the robustness of the decision and how to evaluate the quality of
   decisions. The authors also present tools to help implement these
   concepts in practice. Finally, the authors examine limitations that
   hamper adoption of patient decision analysis in reconstructive surgery

   out-of-pocket expense, and recovery time.}},

Title = {{A joint count-continuous model of travel behavior with selection based

Abstract = {{This paper formulates a multidimensional choice model system that is
   capable of handling multiple nominal variables, multiple count dependent
   variables, and multiple continuous dependent variables. The system takes
   the form of a treatment-outcome selection system with multiple
   treatments and multiple outcome variables. The Maximum Approximate
   Composite Marginal Likelihood (MACML) approach is proposed in
   estimation, and a simulation experiment is undertaken to evaluate the
   ability of the MACML method to recover the model parameters in such
   integrated systems. These experiments show that our estimation approach
   recovers the underlying parameters very well and is efficient from an
   econometric perspective. The parametric model system proposed in the
   paper is applied to an analysis of household-level decisions on
   residential location, motorized vehicle ownership, the number of daily
   motorized tours, the number of daily non-motorized tours, and the
   average distance for the motorized tours. The empirical analysis uses
   the NHTS 2009 data from the San Francisco Bay area. Model estimation
   results show that the choice dimensions considered in this paper are
   inter-related, both through direct observed structural relationships and
   through correlations across unobserved factors (error terms) affecting
   multiple choice dimensions. The significant presence of self-selection
   effects (endogeneity) suggests that modeling the various choice
   processes in an independent sequence of models is not reflective of the
   true relationships that exist across these choice dimensions, as also
   reinforced through the computation of treatment effects in the paper.

Abstract = {{The carbonized eggshell membrane (CEM) powder with abundant micropores
   and high porosity is embedded within conventional sulfur cathodes (CEM-S
   cathodes) as a polysulfide (PS) absorbent for lithium-sulfur batteries.
   The CEM PS absorbent effectively limits the irreversible active material
   loss from CEM-S cathodes and prevents the formation of severe inactive
   agglomerations on the surface of the cathode during cycling. In addition
   to trapping the migrating PSs, the conductive and porous CEM facilitates
   efficient electron transport and electrolyte immersion, which ensures
   successive reactivation and reutilization of the trapped active
   material. As a result, the CEM-S cathodes with a reasonable sulfur
   content of 60 wt \% exhibit a high capacity retention rate of 85\% and a
   low capacity fade rate of 0.10\% per cycle for 150 cycles. Such superior
   cycle stability suggests that natural starting materials with unique
   porous structures can be utilized to manufacture high-performance cell
   components for Li-S cells.}},

Abstract = {{Discounted, discrete-time, discrete state-space, discrete action-space
   Markov decision processes (MDPs) form a classical topic in control, game
   theory, and learning, and as a result are widely applied, increasingly,
   in very large-scale applications. Many algorithms have been developed to
   solve large-scale MDPs. Algorithms based on value iteration are
   particularly popular, as they are more efficient than the generic linear
   programming approach, by an order of magnitude in the number of states
   of the MDP. Yet in the case of budget constrained MDPs, no more
   efficient algorithm than linear programming is known. The theoretically
   slower running times of linear programming may limit the scalability of
   constrained MDPs piratically; while, theoretically, it invites the
   question of whether the increase is somehow intrinsic. In this technical
   note we show that it is not, and provide two algorithms for
   budget-constrained MDPs that are as efficient as value iteration.
   Denoting the running time of value iteration by VI, and the magnitude of
   the input by U, for an MDP with m expected budget constraints our first
   algorithm runs in time O(poly(m, log U).VI). Given a pre-specified
   degree of precision,., for satisfying the budget constraints, our second
   algorithm runs in time O(logm center dot poly(log U).(1/eta(2)) center
   dot VI), but may produce solutions that overutilize each of the m
   budgets by a multiplicative factor of 1 + eta. In fact, one can
   substitute value iteration with any algorithm, possibly specially
   designed for a specific MDP, that solves the MDP quickly to achieve
   similar theoretical guarantees. Both algorithms restrict attention to
   constrained infinite-horizon MDPs under discounted costs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents improved architectures for a fused floating-point
   three-term adder. The fused floating-point three-term adder performs two
   additions in a single unit to achieve better performance and better
   accuracy compared to a network of traditional floating-point two-term
   adders, which is referred to as a discrete design. In order to further
   improve the performance of the three-term adder, several optimization
   techniques are applied including a new exponent compare and significand
   alignment, dual-reduction, early normalization, three-input leading zero
   anticipation, compound addition/rounding and pipelining. The proposed
   design is implemented for both single and double precision and
   synthesized with a 45 nm CMOS standard-cell library. The improved fused
   floating-point three-term adder reduces the area and power consumption
   by about 20\% and reduces the latency by about 35\% compared to a
   discrete floating-point three-term adder. Based on the data flow
   analysis, the proposed three-term adder can be split into three pipeline
   stages. Since the latencies of three pipeline stages are fairly well
   balanced, the throughput is increased to 2.7 times that of the
   non-pipelined design.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to use activation treatments on sodium
   montmorillonite and illite shale, to alter early hydration or later
   pozzolanic reactivity when used as supplementary cementitious materials
   (SCMs). For comparison purposes, treatment methods were also applied to
   the highly reactive pozzolan, metakaolin, and the inert filler, quartz.
   Activation treatment strategies included the addition of 0.15 wt\% zinc
   oxide and the use of thermal treatments to the SCMs at temperatures of
   650 degrees C, 830 degrees C and 930 degrees C. The use of zinc oxide
   additions increased the early hydration rate of SCM-containing pastes,
   yet introduced a chemical retardation and negatively impacted early
   compressive strengths. Moreover, the results suggest that retardation
   was inversely correlated with the pozzolanic reactivity of the SCM used.
   Thermal treatment methods were effective at influencing the SCM
   pozzolanic reactivity, with montmorillonite calcined at 830 degrees C
   and illite calcined at 930 degrees C behaving as late-reacting
   pozzolans. SCMs calcined at these temperatures resulted in higher 90 day
   compressive strengths compared to mortars containing the quartz filler.
   Overall, this study provides insight into different strategies that
   maybe used to enhance the reactivity of impure calcined clays in order
   to facilitate their acceptance into the concrete industry. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Hybrid Li-air batteries with acidic catholyte offer high cell voltage
   and are stable with CO2 in air. However, the practical capacity of the
   acidic catholyte is limited by the low concentration of acids utilized
   and the limited solubility of the discharge products. Only weak acids or
   diluted strong acids with limited practical capacity are generally used
   due to the poor stability of the solid electrolyte in low pH solution.
   We show here the pH of high-concentration, strong acids can be increased
   to near neutral values by forming a buffer with imidazole additive,
   which can be used in hybrid Li-air batteries. With the addition of 6.06
   mol L-1 of imidazole to 6 mol L-1 HCl, the solution has a mild pH of
   similar to 5.0, facilitating the operation of hybrid Li-air batteries
   with high practical capacity and stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for constructing a
   volumetric T-spline from B-reps inspired by constructive solid geometry
   Boolean operations. By solving a harmonic field with proper boundary
   conditions, the input surface is automatically decomposed into regions
   that are classified into two groups represented, topologically, by
   either a cube or a torus. We perform two Boolean operations (union and
   difference) with the primitives and convert them into polycubes through
   parametric mapping. With these polycubes, octree subdivision is carried
   out to obtain a volumetric T-mesh, and sharp features detected from the
   input model are also preserved. An optimization is then performed to
   improve the quality of the volumetric T-spline. The obtained T-spline
   surface is C (2) everywhere except the local region surrounding
   irregular nodes, where the surface continuity is elevated from C (0) to
   G (1). Finally, we extract trivariate B,zier elements from the
   volumetric T-spline and use them directly in isogeometric analysis.}},

Title = {{Channel Estimation and Hybrid Precoding for Millimeter Wave Cellular
   Systems}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular systems will enable gigabit-per-second
   data rates thanks to the large bandwidth available at mmWave
   frequencies. To realize sufficient link margin, mmWave systems will
   employ directional beamforming with large antenna arrays at both the
   transmitter and receiver. Due to the high cost and power consumption of
   gigasample mixed-signal devices, mmWave precoding will likely be divided
   among the analog and digital domains. The large number of antennas and
   the presence of analog beamforming requires the development of
   mmWave-specific channel estimation and precoding algorithms. This paper
   develops an adaptive algorithm to estimate the mmWave channel parameters
   that exploits the poor scattering nature of the channel. To enable the
   efficient operation of this algorithm, a novel hierarchical
   multi-resolution codebook is designed to construct training beamforming
   vectors with different beamwidths. For single-path channels, an upper
   bound on the estimation error probability using the proposed algorithm
   is derived, and some insights into the efficient allocation of the
   training power among the adaptive stages of the algorithm are obtained.
   The adaptive channel estimation algorithm is then extended to the
   multi-path case relying on the sparse nature of the channel. Using the
   estimated channel, this paper proposes a new hybrid analog/ digital
   precoding algorithm that overcomes the hardware constraints on the
   analog-only beamforming, and approaches the performance of digital
   solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity
   channel estimation algorithm achieves comparable precoding gains
   compared to exhaustive channel training algorithms. The results
   illustrate that the proposed channel estimation and precoding algorithms
   can approach the coverage probability achieved by perfect channel
   knowledge even in the presence of interference.}},

Abstract = {{Graph clustering involves the task of dividing nodes into clusters, so
   that the edge density is higher within clusters as opposed to across
   clusters. A natural, classic, and popular statistical setting for
   evaluating solutions to this problem is the stochastic block model, also
   referred to as the planted partition model. In this paper, we present a
   new algorithm-a convexified version of maximum likelihood-for graph
   clustering. We show that, in the classic stochastic block model setting,
   it outperforms existing methods by polynomial factors when the cluster
   size is allowed to have general scalings. In fact, it is within
   logarithmic factors of known lower bounds for spectral methods, and
   there is evidence suggesting that no polynomial time algorithm would do
   significantly better. We then show that this guarantee carries over to a
   more general extension of the stochastic block model. Our method can
   handle the settings of semirandom graphs, heterogeneous degree
   distributions, unequal cluster sizes, unaffiliated nodes, partially
   observed graphs, planted clique/coloring, and so on. In particular, our
   results provide the best exact recovery guarantees to date for the
   planted partition, planted k-disjoint-cliques and planted noisy coloring
   models with general cluster sizes; in other settings, we match the best
   existing results up to logarithmic factors.}},

Abstract = {{Pregnancy produces rapid, non-pathological volume-overload in the
   maternal circulation due to the demands of the growing fetus. Using a
   bovine model for human pregnancy, previous work in our laboratory has
   shown remarkable pregnancy-induced changes in leaflet size and mechanics
   of the mitral valve. The present study sought to relate these changes to
   structural alterations in the collagenous leaflet matrix. Anterior
   mitral valve leaflets were harvested from non-pregnant heifers and
   pregnant cows (pregnancy stage estimated by fetal length). We measured
   changes in the thickness of the leaflet and its anatomic layers via
   Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining, and in collagen crimp (wavelength and
   percent collagen crimped) via picrosirius red staining and polarized
   microscopy. Collagen concentration was determined biochemically:
   hydroxyproline assay for total collagen and pepsin-acid extraction for
   uncrosslinked collagen. Small-angle light scattering (SALS) assessed
   changes in internal fiber architecture (characterized by degree of fiber
   alignment and preferred fiber direction). Pregnancy produced significant
   changes to collagen structure in the mitral valve. Fiber alignment
   decreased 17\% with an 11.5A degrees rotation of fiber orientation
   toward the radial axis. Collagen fiber crimp was dramatically lost,
   accompanied by a 53\% thickening of the fibrosa, and a 16\% increase in
   total collagen concentration, both suggesting that new collagen is being
   synthesized. Extractable collagen concentration was low, both in the
   non-pregnant and pregnant state, suggesting early crosslinking of
   newly-synthesized collagen. This study has shown that the mitral valve
   is strongly adaptive during pregnancy, with significant changes in size,
   collagen content and architecture in response to rapidly changing
   demands.}},
