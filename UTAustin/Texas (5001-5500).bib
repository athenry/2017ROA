Abstract = {{High-resolution self-consistent numerical simulation of electromagnetic
   wave phenomena in an axisymmetric capacitively coupled plasma reactor is
   reported. A prominent centre-peaked plasma density profile is observed
   for driving frequencies of 60MHz and is consistent with observations in
   the literature and accompanying experimental studies. A power spectrum
   of the simulated wave electric field reveals the presence of
   well-resolved high frequency harmonic content up to the 20th harmonic of
   the excitation frequency; an observation that has also been reported in
   experiments. Importantly, the simulation results reveal that the
   occurrence of higher harmonics is strongly correlated with the
   occurrence of a centre-peaked plasma density profile.}},

Abstract = {{Using molecular simulations, we investigate the structural and diffusive
   dynamics properties of a model fluid in highly absorptive cylindrical
   pores. At subcritical temperatures, self-diffusivity displays three
   distinct regimes as a function of average pore density rho: (1) a
   decrease in self-diffusivity with increasing rho at low rho, (2)
   constant self-diffusivity with respect to varying rho at moderate
   density, and (3) a decrease in self-diffusivity with increasing rho at
   high density. These regimes are closely linked to the thermodynamic
   properties of the fluid in the pore, specifically, the adsorption
   isotherm, isosteric heat of adsorption, and the density profile. We show
   that these three diffusivity regimes qualitatively correspond to three
   distinct adsorption regimes: monolayer formation, multilayer adsorption,
   and pore filling, respectively. In addition, we find that the
   self-diffusivity is a universal function of the local film density in
   the monolayer formation regime at subcritical temperatures. The results
   of this work suggest a potential means to estimate the self-diffusivity
   over a broad pressure range using a limited number of experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic imaging, a promising new diagnostic medical imaging
   modality, can provide high contrast images of molecular features by
   introducing highly- absorbing plasmonic nanoparticles. Currently, it is
   uncertain whether the absorption of low fluence pulsed light by
   plasmonic nanoparticles could lead to cellular damage. In our studies we
   have shown that low fluence pulsed laser excitation of accumulated
   nanoparticles at low concentration does not impact cell growth and
   viability, while we identify thresholds at which higher nanoparticle
   concentrations and fluences produce clear evidence of cell death. The
   results provide insights for improved design of photoacoustic contrast
   agents and for applications in combined imaging and therapy.}},

   polyacetylene nanofibers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Thermal transport in oxidized polyacetylene (PA) nanofibers with
   diameters in the range between 74 and 126 nm is measured with the use of
   a suspended micro heater device. With the error due to both radiation
   and contact thermal resistance corrected via a differential measurement
   procedure, the obtained thermal conductivity of oxidized PA nanofibers
   varies in the range between 0.84 and 1.24Wm(-1) K-1 near room
   temperature, and decreases by 40\%-70\% after iodine doping. It is also
   found that the thermal conductivity of oxidized PA nanofibers increases
   with temperature between 100 and 350 K. Because of exposure to oxygen
   during sample preparation, the PA nanofibers are oxidized to be
   electrically insulating before and after iodine doping. The measurement
   results reveal that iodine doping can result in enhanced lattice
   disorder and reduced lattice thermal conductivity of PA nanofibers. If
   the oxidation issue can be addressed via further research to increase
   the electrical conductivity via doping, the observed suppressed lattice
   thermal conductivity in doped polymer nanofibers can be useful for the
   development of such conducting polymer nanostructures for thermoelectric
   energy conversion. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Conversion of multilayer graphene into continuous ultrathin sp(3)-bonded
   carbon films on metal surfaces}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The conversion of multilayer graphenes into sp(3)-bonded carbon films on
   metal surfaces (through hydrogenation or fluorination of the outer
   surface of the top graphene layer) is indicated through first-principles
   computations. The main driving force for this conversion is the
   hybridization between sp(3) orbitals and metal surface d(z)(2) orbitals.
   The induced electronic gap states and spin moments in the carbon layers
   are confined in a region within 0.5 nm of the metal surface. Whether the
   conversion occurs depend on the fraction of hydrogenated (fluorinated) C
   atoms at the outer surface and on the number of stacked graphene layers.
   In the analysis of the Eliashberg spectral functions for the sp(3)
   carbon films on a metal surface that is diamagnetic, the strong covalent
   metal-sp(3) carbon bonds induce soft phonon modes that predominantly
   contribute to large electron-phonon couplings, suggesting the
   possibility of phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our computational
   results suggest a route to experimental realization of large-area
   ultrathin sp(3)-bonded carbon films on metal surfaces.}},

Title = {{Plasticity mechanism for copper extrusion in through-silicon vias for

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrated the plasticity mechanism for copper (Cu)
   extrusion in through-silicon via structures under thermal cycling. The
   local plasticity was directly observed by synchrotron x-ray
   micro-diffraction near the top of the via with the amount increasing
   with the peak temperature. The Cu extrusion was confirmed by Atomic
   Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements and found to be consistent with the
   observed Cu plasticity behavior. A simple analytical model elucidated
   the role of plasticity during thermal cycling, and finite element
   analyses were carried out to confirm the plasticity mechanism as well as
   the effect of the via/Si interface. The model predictions were able to
   account for the via extrusions observed in two types of experiments,
   with one representing a nearly free sliding interface and the other a
   strongly bonded interface. Interestingly, the AFM extrusion profiles
   seemed to contour with the local grain structures near the top of the
   via, suggesting that the grain structure not only affects the yield
   strength of the Cu and thus its plasticity but could also be important
   in controlling the pop-up behavior and the statistics for a large
   ensemble of vias. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A green, rapid microwave-assisted solvothermal process using
   tetraethylene glycol (TEG) as a reducing agent has been explored as a
   soft-chemistry route for the preparation of various lower-valent
   transition metal oxides. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach,
   lower-valent binary oxides such as V4O9, Mn3O4 or MnO, CoO, and Cu2O
   have been obtained within a short reaction time of 30 min by reducing,
   respectively, V2O5, MnO2, Co3O4, and CuO with TEG at <300 degrees C.
   Moreover, the approach has been used to extract oxygen from ternary
   oxides such as LaFeO3, SrMnO3, LaCoO3, LaNiO3, and La4Ni3O10. The
   oxidation state of the transition metal ions and the oxygen content in
   these ternary oxides could be tuned by precisely controlling the
   reaction temperatures from 160 to 300 degrees C. The products have been
   characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and iodometric titration. The
   versatility of this novel technique is demonstrated by the facile
   synthesis of V4O9, which has only been produced recently in single-phase
   form.}},

Abstract = {{We design and demonstrate a compact and low-power, band-engineered,

   optimum coupling to the slow-light mode of the band-engineered PCW. The
   half-wave switching voltage is measured to be V-pi = 0.97 +/- 0.02 V
   over an optical spectrum range of 8 nm, corresponding to the effective
   in-device r(33) of 1190 pm/V and V-pi x L = 0.291 +/- 0.006 V x mm in a
   push-pull configuration. Excluding the slow-light effect, we estimate
   that the EO polymer is poled with an efficiency of 89 pm/V in the slot.

Volume = {{191}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5052-5064}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The invariant NKT (iNKT) cells represent a unique group of alpha beta T
   cells that have been classified based on their exclusive usage of the
   invariant V alpha 14J alpha 18 TCR alpha-chain and their innate-like
   effector function. Thus far, the transcriptional programs that control V
   alpha 14Ja18 TCR alpha rearrangements and the population size of iNKT
   cells are still incompletely defined. E protein transcription factors
   have been shown to play necessary roles in the development of multiple T
   cell lineages, including iNKT cells. In this study, we examined E
   protein functions in T cell development through combined deletion of
   genes encoding E protein inhibitors Id2 and Id3. Deletion of Id2 and Id3
   in T cell progenitors resulted in a partial block at the pre-TCR
   selection checkpoint and a dramatic increase in numbers of iNKT cells.
   The increase in iNKT cells is accompanied with a biased rearrangement
   involving V alpha 14 to J alpha 18 recombination at the double-positive
   stage and enhanced proliferation of iNKT cells. We further demonstrate
   that a 50\% reduction of E proteins can cause a dramatic switch from
   iNKT to innate-like gamma delta T cell fate in Id2- and Id3-deficient
   mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that Id2- and Id3-mediated
   inhibition of E proteins controls iNKT development by restricting
   lineage choice and population expansion.}},

Abstract = {{We propose the concept of a graphene-based nanoantenna-enhanced
   photomixer to realize wideband-tunable terahertz (THz) frequency
   generation. When two laser beams are focused on the graphene nanoemitter
   of a planar field-emission diode, THz current oscillations can be
   created at the emitter tip through the optical heterodyne. Graphene's
   optical transparency allows suitably designed plasmonic nanoantennas to
   boost the mixing of laser radiation at the emitter tip, significantly
   increasing the overall produced photomixing current. The THz wave
   generated at the graphene emitter is then coupled to a loading circuit,
   thanks to the THz wave confinement in the graphene nanostructures. Our
   design is ideally suited for THz sources that may be tuned from DC to 10
   THz by simply shifting the frequency offset of two pumping lasers.}},

Abstract = {{A biopsy of the first lymph node to which a tumor drains-the sentinel
   lymph node (SLN)-is commonly performed to identify micrometastases.
   Image guidance of the SLN biopsy procedure has the potential to improve
   its accuracy and decrease its morbidity. We have developed a new stable
   contrast agent for photoacoustic image-guided SLN biopsy: silica-coated
   gold nanoplates (Si-AuNPs). The Si-AuNPs exhibit high photothermal
   stability when exposed to pulsed and continuous wave laser irradiation.
   This makes them well suited for in vivo photoacoustic imaging.
   Furthermore, Si-AuNPs are shown to have low cytotoxicity. We tested the
   Si-AuNPs for SLN mapping in a mouse model where they exhibited a strong,
   sustained photoacoustic signal. Real-time ultrasound and photoacoustic
   imaging revealed that the Si-AuNPs quickly drain to the SLN, gradually
   spreading throughout a large portion of the node.}},

   design of living systems. In contrast to classical cell engineering
   approaches, synthetic biology enables cellular networks to be understood
   as a combination of modular elements in much the same way as unit
   operations combine to describe a chemical plant. Consequently, models
   for the behavior of these designed systems are inspired by frameworks
   developed for traditional chemical engineering design. There are direct
   analogies between cellular metabolism and reaction networks in a
   chemical process. As examples, thermodynamic and kinetic models of
   chemical reaction networks have been used to simulate fluxes within
   living systems and predict the performance of synthetic parts. Concepts
   from process control have been brought to bear on the design of
   transcriptional and translational regulatory networks. Such engineering
   frameworks have greatly aided the design and understanding of living
   systems and have enabled the design of cells exhibiting complex dynamic
   behavior and high productivity of desirable compounds. This review
   summarizes efforts to quantitatively model cellular behavior (both
   endogenous and synthetic), especially as related to the design of living
   systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-phase (Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95)(0.5)/(Zr0.92Y0.O-08(1.96))(0.5) (GDC/YSZ)
   nanocomposite thin films with vertically aligned structure are grown as
   the electrolyte for thin film solid oxide fuel cells (TFSOFCs). X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results
   confirm that GDC and YSZ grow as separated, high crystallinity
   nanocolumns with tunable column width on both single crystal and
   polycrystalline anode substrates. Impedance measurements demonstrate
   similar to 50\% enhancement in ionic conductivity compared to pure
   single-crystal-like GDC thin film. The enhanced properties in the
   GDC/YSZ vertically aligned nanocomposite (VAN) system may be attributed
   to two-phase strain coupling and the fast ionic transport rate along the
   vertical interfaces. The VAN is applied in thin film SOFC as a part of
   the electrolyte in the single cells. The overall power density increases
   more than 40\% compared with that of the cells without VAN electrolyte.
   This work demonstrates the first VAN nanostructured electrolyte with the
   essential vertical ion-transport channels. The new VAN electrolyte
   provides superior out-of-plane ionic conductivity compared to those
   single phase electrolytes as well as the nanolayered electrolytes. (C)

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes in supercapacitors have recently
   demonstrated enhanced performance compared to conventional carbon-based
   electrodes; however, the underlying relationships between electrode
   curvature and capacitance remain unclear. Using computer simulations, we
   evaluate the capacitive performance of metallic (6,6), (10,10), and
   (16,16) CNTs in {[}BMIM]{[}PF6] ionic liquid (IL), with particular
   attention to the relative contributions of the electric double layer
   (EDL) capacitance (C-D) at the CNT/IL interface and the electrode
   quantum capacitance (C-Q). Our classical molecular dynamics simulations
   reveal that C-D improves with increasing electrode curvature, which we
   discuss in terms of how the curvature affects both the electric field
   strength and EDL microstructure. In addition, the C-Q of the CNTs is
   constant near the Fermi level and increases with curvature, as also
   demonstrated by density functional theory calculations. Our study shows
   that the electrode curvature effect on the total interfacial capacitance
   can be a strong function of applied voltage, which we attribute to the
   shifting contributions of C-Q and C-D.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are short transcripts that typically do not
   encode proteins and often act as regulators of gene expression through a
   variety of mechanisms. Regulatory sRNAs have been identified in many
   species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of
   tuberculosis. Here, we use a computational algorithm to predict sRNA
   candidates in the mycobacterial species M. smegmatis and M. bovis BCG
   and confirmed the expression of many sRNAs using Northern blotting.
   Thus, we have identified 17 and 23 novel sRNAs in M. smegmatis and M.
   bovis BCG, respectively. We have also applied a high-throughput
   technique (Deep-RACE) to map the 59 and 39 ends of many of these sRNAs
   and identified potential regulators of sRNAs by analysis of existing
   ChIP-seq datasets. The sRNAs identified in this work likely contribute
   to the unique biology of mycobacteria.}},

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the relationship between 3-year pedestrian crash
   counts across Census tracts in Austin, Texas, and various land use,
   network, and demographic attributes, such as land use balance,
   residents' access to commercial land uses, sidewalk density, lane-mile
   densities (by roadway class), and population and employment densities
   (by type). The model specification allows for region-specific
   heterogeneity, correlation across response types, and spatial
   autocorrelation via a Poisson-based multivariate conditional
   auto-regressive (CAR) framework and is estimated using Bayesian Markov
   chain Monte Carlo methods. Least-squares regression estimates of
   walk-miles traveled per zone serve as the exposure measure. Here, the
   Poisson-lognormal multivariate CAR model outperforms an aspatial
   Poisson-lognormal multivariate model and a spatial model (without
   cross-severity correlation), both in terms of fit and inference.
   Positive spatial autocorrelation emerges across neighborhoods, as
   expected (due to latent heterogeneity or missing variables that trend in
   space, resulting in spatial clustering of crash counts). In comparison,
   the positive aspatial, bivariate cross correlation of severe (fatal or
   incapacitating) and non-severe crash rates reflects latent covariates
   that have impacts across severity levels but are more local in nature
   (such as lighting conditions and local sight obstructions), along with
   spatially lagged cross correlation. Results also suggest greater mixing
   of residences and commercial land uses is associated with higher
   pedestrian crash risk across different severity levels, ceteris paribus,
   presumably since such access produces more potential conflicts between
   pedestrian and vehicle movements. Interestingly, network densities show
   variable effects, and sidewalk provision is associated with lower
   severe-crash rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) was used to characterize
   the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2 on indium-doped tin oxide
   (ITO) substrates by studying electron transfer through pores in the thin
   films (1-5 nm thickness). The extent of electron transfer, and thus the
   porosity of the films, was evaluated by transient electrochemistry.
   These studies show that ALD deposition of TiO2 on ITO does not produce
   pinhole-free films but rather porous deposits with electrochemical
   behavior similar to that of microelectrode arrays up to about 30 ALD
   cycles. All the experimental results are explained in the context of a
   numerical model developed by finite element analysis and corroborated by
   complementary conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) results that
   directly reveal localized, nanoscale current conduction paths in thinner
   TiO2 layers with a transition to more spatially uniform conduction in
   the thickest layers. SECM images demonstrate the existence of pinholes
   even on films that have been subjected to more than 100 ALD cycles
   (thicknesses larger than 4 nm).}},

Abstract = {{BaIrO3 adopts the 9R polytype structure if it is synthesized at ambient
   pressure. High-pressure and high-temperature treatments up to 10 GPa
   have led to other 5H and 6H polytype phases, which are quenchable to the
   ambient condition. However, the single-phase 3C perovskite, the end
   member of polytypes, has not been obtained so far. Here we report the
   high-pressure synthesis of BaIrO3 perovskite under 25 GPa and 1150
   degrees C. Rietveld refinement on the powder x-ray diffraction pattern
   revealed that this new compound crystallizes in a tetragonal I4/mcm
   structure rather than the expected cubic Pm-3m structure. The new
   perovskite is a Pauli paramagnetic metal with a Fermi liquid ground
   state, i.e., rho proportional to T-2 below 6 K. The availability of
   BaIrO3 perovskite also allows completion of the structure-physical
   property evolution in the AIrO(3) perovskites (A = Ca, Sr, Ba). The
   Fermi energy located in bands originated from Ir: 5d and O: 2p electrons
   are found to be very sensitive to the change of crystal structure.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of high-quality single crystals of graphene by chemical vapor
   deposition on copper (Cu) has not always achieved control over domain
   size and morphology, and the results vary from lab to lab under
   presumably similar growth conditions. We discovered that oxygen (O) on
   the Cu surface substantially decreased the graphene nucleation density
   by passivating Cu surface active sites. Control of surface O enabled
   repeatable growth of centimeter-scale single-crystal graphene domains.
   Oxygen also accelerated graphene domain growth and shifted the growth
   kinetics from edge-attachment-limited to diffusion-limited.
   Correspondingly, the compact graphene domain shapes became dendritic.
   The electrical quality of the graphene films was equivalent to that of
   mechanically exfoliated graphene, in spite of being grown in the
   presence of O.}},

   higher manganese silicides}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Experiments and analysis have been carried out to investigate the
   effects of Al and (Al,Ge) doping on the microstructure and
   thermoelectric properties of polycrystalline higher manganese silicide
   (HMS) samples, which were prepared by solid-state reaction, ball
   milling, and followed by spark plasma sintering. It has been found that
   Al doping effectively increases the hole concentration, which leads to
   an increase in the electrical conductivity and power factor. By
   introducing the second dopant Ge into Al-doped HMS, the electrical
   conductivity is increased, and the Seebeck coefficient is decreased as a
   result of further increased hole concentration. The peak power factor is
   found to occur at a hole concentration between 1.8 x 10(21) and 2.2 x
   10(21) cm(-3) measured at room temperature. The (Al,Ge)-doped HMS
   samples show lower power factors owing to their higher hole
   concentrations. The mobility of Mn(Al0.0035GeySi0.9965-y)1.8 with y =
   0.035 varies approximately as T-3/2 above 200 K, suggesting acoustic
   phonon scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism. The thermal
   conductivity of HMS does not change appreciably by Al or (Al,Ge) doping.
   The maximum ZT of (Al,Ge)-doped HMS is 0.57 at 823 K, which is similar
   to the highest value found in the Al-doped HMS samples. The ZT values
   were reduced in the Mn(Al0.0035GeySi0.9965-y) 1.8 samples with high Ge
   concentration of y = 0.025 and 0.035, because of reduced power factor.
   In addition, a two-band model was employed to show that the hole
   contribution to the thermal conductivity dominates the bipolar and
   electron contributions for all samples from 300 to 823K and accounts for
   about 12\% of the total thermal conductivity at about 800 K. (c) 2013

Title = {{Microsegregation effects on the thermal conductivity of
   silicon-germanium alloys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{A silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloy is a promising candidate for
   thermoelectric materials; while it shows a significantly reduced thermal
   conductivity (k) as compared to pure Si and Ge, the k values obtained
   from previous experiments and computations tend to be widely scattered.
   We present here a computational analysis of thermal transport in SiGe,
   particularly the effects of the local segregation (microsegregation) of
   alloying elements. Our nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations
   confirm the strong dependence of k on the Si: Ge ratio and the
   occurrence of the minimum k around Si0.8Ge0.2, consistent with existing
   experimental observations. Moreover, our study clearly demonstrates that
   the k of Si0.8Ge0.2 increases substantially and monotonically as Ge
   atoms undergo segregation; that is, the magnitude of alloy scattering is
   found to be sensitive to homogeneity in the distribution of alloying
   elements. Nonequilibrium Green's function analysis also shows that such
   microsegregation enhances phonon transmission due to the reduced number
   of scattering centers. The findings highlight that distribution
   homogeneity, along with composition, can be a critical factor in
   determining the k of SiGe alloys. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Analyzing milestoning networks for molecular kinetics: Definitions,
   algorithms, and examples}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Network representations are becoming increasingly popular for analyzing
   kinetic data from techniques like Milestoning, Markov State Models, and
   Transition Path Theory. Mapping continuous phase space trajectories into
   a relatively small number of discrete states helps in visualization of
   the data and in dissecting complex dynamics to concrete mechanisms.
   However, not only are molecular networks derived from molecular dynamics
   simulations growing in number, they are also getting increasingly
   complex, owing partly to the growth in computer power that allows us to
   generate longer and better converged trajectories. The increased
   complexity of the networks makes simple interpretation and qualitative
   insight of the molecular systems more difficult to achieve. In this
   paper, we focus on various network representations of kinetic data and
   algorithms to identify important edges and pathways in these networks.
   The kinetic data can be local and partial (such as the value of rate
   coefficients between states) or an exact solution to kinetic equations
   for the entire system (such as the stationary flux between vertices). In
   particular, we focus on the Milestoning method that provides fluxes as
   the main output. We proposed Global Maximum Weight Pathways as a useful
   tool for analyzing molecular mechanism in Milestoning networks. A
   closely related definition was made in the context of Transition Path
   Theory. We consider three algorithms to find Global Maximum Weight
   Pathways: Recursive Dijkstra's, Edge-Elimination, and Edge-List
   Bisection. The asymptotic efficiency of the algorithms is analyzed and
   numerical tests on finite networks show that Edge-List Bisection and
   Recursive Dijkstra's algorithms are most efficient for sparse and dense
   networks, respectively. Pathways are illustrated for two examples: helix
   unfolding and membrane permeation. Finally, we illustrate that networks
   based on local kinetic information can lead to incorrect interpretation
   of molecular mechanisms. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB) electrolyte additive on
   the performance of full lithium-ion cells pairing the high-voltage
   spinel cathode with the graphite anode was systematically investigated.
   Adding 1 wt \% LiBOB to the electrolyte significantly improved the cycle
   life and Coulombic efficiency of the full-cells at 30 and 45 degrees C.
   As the LiBOB was preferentially oxidized and reduced compared with
   LiBOB-free electrolyte during cycling, their relative contributions to
   the improved capacity retention in full-cells was gauged by pairing
   fresh and LiBOB-treated electrodes with various combinations. The
   results indicated that a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) film on
   graphite produced by the reduction of the LiBOB additive is more robust
   and stable against Mn dissolution problem during cycling at 45 degrees C
   compared with the SEI formed by the reduction of the base (LiBOB-free)
   electrolyte. In addition, a 3 wt \% LiBOB-added electrolyte showed
   reduced Mn dissolution compared with the base electrolyte after storing
   the fully charged Li1-xNi0.42Fe0.08Mn1.5O4 (LNFMO) electrodes at 60
   degrees C for one month. It is believed that LiBOB aids in stabilizing
   the electrolyte by trapping the PF5, i.e., sequestering the radical
   which tends to oxidize EC and DEC electrolyte solvents. Thus, oxidation
   is suppressed on the carbon black particles in the positive electrode,
   as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses. As a result, HF generation is
   suppressed, which in turn results in less Mn dissolution from the spinel
   cathode.}},

Abstract = {{During chemical-vapor-deposited graphene transfer onto target
   substrates, a polymer film coating is necessary to provide a mechanical
   support. However, the remaining polymer residues after organic solvent
   rinsing cannot be effectively removed by the empirical thermal annealing
   in vacuum or forming gas. Little progress has been achieved in the past
   years, for little is known about the chemical evolution of the polymer
   macromolecules and their interaction with the environment. Through in
   situ Raman and infrared spectroscopy studies of PMMA transferred
   graphene annealed in nitrogen, two main processes are uncovered
   involving the polymer dehydrogenation below 200 degrees C and a
   subsequent depolymerization above 200 degrees C. Polymeric carbons over
   the monolayer graphitic carbon are found to constitute a fundamental
   bottleneck for a thorough etching of PMMA residues. The dehydrogenated
   polymeric chains consist of active C=C bonding sites that are readily
   attacked by oxidative gases. The combination of Raman spectroscopy,
   X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy
   reveals the largely improved carbon removal by annealing in oxidative
   atmospheres. CO2 outperforms other oxidative gases (e.g., NO2, O-2)
   because of its oxidative strength to remove polymeric carbons
   efficiently at 500 degrees C in a few minutes while preserving the
   underlying graphene lattice. The strategy and mechanism described here
   open the way for a significantly improved oxidative cleaning of
   transferred graphene sheets, which may require optimization tailored to
   specific applications.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},

Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{251-274}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{A parallel scheme is developed to solve fluid-solid interaction problems
   using the immersed boundary method (IBM). The fluid solver is based on a
   non-staggered pressure-based finite volume method, targeted to solving
   3D incompressible low Reynolds number flows. Domain decomposition is
   employed to partition the global mesh into local meshes that are
   distributed over processors. A new efficient parallel marking algorithm
   is introduced to track the fluid-solid interface for IBM implementation.
   A second layer of ghost cells is included in the interpolation in order
   to produce consistent solutions between serial and parallel runs. Three
   linear solvers are implemented: (1) Algebraic Multi Grid (AMG), (2)
   BCGSTAB with AMG preconditioner, and (3) BCGSTAB with ILU0
   preconditioner. The parallel performance and benchmarks of the linear
   solvers are investigated on different architectures by solving the 2D
   diffusion-convection problem and the 3D flow over sphere problem.
   Finally, the parallel implementation is validated by a micro-cantilever
   damping case. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   over a wide range of injection currents, with a side mode suppression
   ratio (SMSR) of 41.1 dB. This provides a practical, low-cost method to
   fabricate quarter-wave phase shifted DFB lasers with high performance
   without any epitaxial regrowth or the use of electron-beam lithography,
   thereby simplifying the fabrication of DFB lasers with stable and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a distributed energy-saving lighting strategy for
   the arrangements of a lighting network consisting of a group of
   light-emitting diode (LED) lamps and users. LED lamps have a dimming
   support feature to meet the illuminance requirements imposed by
   individual users. Both groups interact with each other via visible light
   communication (VLC) or other wireless communication features. This work
   aims to identify a configuration of lamps leading to the maximal energy
   saving in adaptive and distributed ways. To this end, a distributed
   assignment strategy is developed based on a message-passing framework
   where only local interactions among lamps and users are allowed for
   calculations and exchanges of the information on their status. The
   simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other
   distributed algorithms in a range of indoor lighting configurations. (C)

Abstract = {{We describe two studies that were aimed towards increasing our
   understanding of how the visibility of distortions on stereoscopically
   viewed 3D images is affected by scene content and distortion types. By
   assuming that subjects' performance would be highly correlated with the
   visibility of local distorted patches, we analyzed subjects' performance
   in locating distortion patches when viewing stereoscopic 3D images.
   Subjects' performances are measured by whether they successfully locate
   a local distorted patch, the times they spent to finish the task, and
   subjective quality ratings given by subjects. The visual data used in
   this work are co-registered stereo images with co-registered ``ground
   truth{''} range (depth) data. Varied statistical analysis methods were
   used to discuss the significance of our observations. Three observations
   are drawn from our analyses. First, blur, JPEG, and JP2K distortions in
   stereo 3D images may be suppressed if one of the left or right views is
   undistorted. Second, contrast masking does not occur, or is reduced,
   while viewing white noise distorted stereo 3D images. Third, there is no
   depth/disparity masking effect when viewing stereo 3D images, but there
   may be (conversely) depth-related facilitation effects for blur, JPEG,
   and JP2K distorted stereo 3D images.}},

Abstract = {{The design, fabrication, and testing of a hybrid micro air vehicle
   capable of morphing between a high-hover-endurance rotary-wing mode and
   a high-cruise-speed fixed-wing mode is described. The micro air vehicle
   can efficiently perform a mission comprising outdoor flight to a target,
   followed by indoor surveillance and a return to the launch point. In
   addition, the micro air vehicle can function as a multirole platform,
   capable of flying exclusively as a fixed-wing or a rotary-wing vehicle.
   The key design drivers were 1) minimizing power required to hover, 2)
   ensuring static longitudinal stability in fixed-wing mode, and 3)
   minimizing the change in geometry between flight modes. Configuration
   trade studies were performed using blade element momentum theory for the
   rotary-wing mode and modified lifting-line theory for the fixed-wing
   mode. Design drivers for the rotary-wing mode and fixed-wing mode were
   often conflicting, and the selection of the final vehicle planform was
   primarily based on longitudinal static stability in fixed-wing mode. Two
   proof-of-concept prototypes with identical geometries, one for each
   flight mode, were constructed using off-the-shelf components and tested.
   Analytical predictions were validated by experimental measurements on
   the prototype vehicles. The final vehicle design is a flying wing with
   aft-swept, negatively twisted wings, having a wingspan of 394 mm and a
   mass of 85 g. The cruise velocity is 13.2 m/s, and the power required to
   hover is 11.6 W.}},

Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{B329-B338}},

Abstract = {{The time-lapse seismic survey for CO2 sequestration study at Cranfield
   can be problematic because of misalignments between time-lapse data
   sets. Such misalignments can be caused by the seismic data processing
   workflow and may result in the wrong interpretation of time-lapse
   seismic amplitude differences. We propose an efficient
   local-correlation-based warping method of registering the time-lapse
   poststack data sets, which can align these data sets without changing
   original amplitudes. Application of our registration method to Cranfield
   time-lapse data demonstrates its effectiveness in separating time-shift
   character from seismic amplitude signature. After registration,
   time-lapse differences show an improved consistency in vertical cross
   sections and a more localized distribution of difference amplitudes
   along the horizon, allowing us to apply a high-resolution basis pursuit
   inversion (BPI) for acoustic impedances. Inversion results show that
   decreases in acoustic impedances occur mostly at the top of the
   injection interval, which can be used as an indicator of rock properties
   to detect a subsurface CO2 plume.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICS}},

Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{D403-D418}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A model was recently introduced to describe the complex electrical
   conductivity and high-frequency dielectric constant of isotropic clayey
   porous materials. We generalized that approach to the case of
   anisotropic and tight hydrocarbon-bearing shales and mudrocks by
   introducing tensorial versions of formation factor and tortuosity.
   In-phase and quadrature conductivity tensors have common eigenvectors,
   but the eigenvectors of the dielectric tensor may be different due to
   influence of the solid phase at high frequencies. In-phase and
   quadrature contributions to complex electrical conductivity depend on
   saturation, salinity, porosity, temperature, and cation exchange
   capacity (alternatively, specific surface area) of the porous material.
   Kerogen is likely to have a negligible contribution to the cation
   exchange capacity of the material because all exchangeable sites in the
   functional groups of organic matter may have been polymerized during
   diagenesis. An anisotropic experiment is performed to validate some of
   the properties described by the proposed model, especially to verify
   that the electrical anisotropy factor is the same for in-phase and
   quadrature conductivities. We used two samples from the Bakken
   formation. Experimental data confirm the validity of the model. Also,
   the range of values for cation exchange capacity determined when
   implementing the new model with experimental data agree with the known
   range of cation exchange capacity for the Bakken shale. Measurements
   indicate that the bulk-space tortuosity in the direction normal to
   bedding plane can be higher than 100.}},

Title = {{Modeling potential CO2 leakage rate along a fault in Mahogany Field}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{15-24}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In geological CO2 storage projects, faults and the damage zones
   surrounding them may provide a leaky conduit for CO2 to escape the
   storage formation and enter shallower sensitive zones. Upward migration
   of CO2 whether within the damage zone or along the fault itself can be
   attenuated by permeable layers that intersect the fault. Quantifying CO2
   flux along leakage paths requires values of transport coefficients along
   the pathways, which are rarely available. This work provides a data
   point for one type of escape path permeability, namely a conductive
   fault. The key feature is that the field data yield two independent
   estimates of the permeability, and the estimates are consistent.
   We describe two methods to estimate plausible range of fault properties
   from field data in the Mahogany Field, Trinidad. The Mahogany field is
   well characterized and this study uses the geology of this
   hydrocarbon-bearing structure to represent the geology of analogous
   structures that do not contain hydrocarbon. Fault permeability and
   capillary entry pressure are estimated from a shale gouge ratio (SGR)
   correlation. An independent estimate of fault permeability is obtained
   from a simple model of cross flow between the adjacent fault blocks and
   the measured pressure response during the production period. The two
   estimates agree, suggesting that the SGR method could be useful in
   assessing risk associated with along-fault leakage of stored CO2.
   We use a simple leakage model to estimate the worst-case CO2 flux along
   the fault. Results show that for the inferred fault permeability and a
   plausible range of pressure elevation at the base of the fault, the
   predicted CO2 fluxes at top of the fault are in tenths mg/m(2)/s. That
   is above the range of background CO2 fluxes measured at surface, but
   below high fluxes in nature. The CO2 flux along fault could be
   attenuated to zero by permeable layers that intersect the fault. However
   the attenuation is temporary if layers are sealed at other end. The flow
   rate at top of fault increases asymptotically after the attenuation
   starts decreasing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   traffic. Simple mechanisms are proposed to decide when the current set
   of replication nodes should be changed, to enable new applications and
   nodes to efficiently bootstrap into a working WSAN, to recover from
   failing nodes, and to adapt to changing conditions. Extensive
   simulations demonstrate that our approach can extend a WSAN's lifetime
   by at least 60\%, and up to a factor of 10x depending on the lifetime
   criterion being considered. The feasibility of the proposed framework
   has been validated in a prototype with 20 resource-constrained motes,
   and the results obtained via simulation for large WSANs have been also
   corroborated in that prototype.}},

Abstract = {{An anisotropic homogenization theory for spatially dispersive periodic
   arrays is developed, based on the microscopic Maxwell equations, that
   yields causal, macroscopic permittivities, and inverse permeabilities
   for the fundamental Floquet modes of the arrays. (Macroscopic
   magnetoelectric coefficients are not required.) Reality conditions,
   reciprocity relations, passivity conditions, and causality relations are
   derived for these spatially dispersive macroscopic constitutive
   parameters. A significant feature of the formulation is that the
   macroscopic permittivities and permeabilities reduce to their
   anisotropic-continuum definitions in terms of ordinary macroscopic
   averages at the low spatial and temporal frequencies. In addition,
   diamagnetic rnetamaterial arrays require no special considerations or
   modifications to accommodate their unusual characteristics. A numerical
   example of a 2D array comprised of circular-cylinder inclusions is given
   that confirms the theoretical results for the computed electric and

Title = {{Measures of the environmental footprint of the front end of the nuclear
   fuel cycle}},
Journal = {{ENERGY ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{898-910}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Previous estimates of environmental impacts associated with the front
   end of the nuclear fuel cycle (FEFC) have focused primarily on energy
   consumption and CO2 emissions. Results have varied widely. This work
   builds upon reports from operating facilities and other primary data
   sources to build a database of front end environmental impacts. This
   work also addresses land transformation and water withdrawals associated
   with the processes of the FEFC These processes include uranium
   extraction, conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication, depleted uranium
   disposition, and transportation.
   To allow summing the impacts across processes, all impacts were
   normalized per tonne of natural uranium mined as well as per MWh(e) of
   electricity produced, a more conventional unit for measuring
   environmental impacts that facilitates comparison with other studies.
   This conversion was based on mass balances and process efficiencies
   associated with the current once-through LWR fuel cycle.
   Total energy input is calculated at 8.7 x 10(-3) GJ(e)/MWh(e) of
   electricity and 5.9 x 10(-3) GJ(t)/MWh(e) of thermal energy. It is
   dominated by the energy required for uranium extraction, conversion to
   fluoride compound for subsequent enrichment, and enrichment. An estimate
   of the carbon footprint is made from the direct energy consumption at
   1.7 kg CO2/MWh(e). Water use is likewise dominated by requirements of
   uranium extraction, totaling 154 L/MWh(e). Land use is calculated at 8 x
   10(-3) m(2)/MWh(e), over 90\% of which is due to uranium extraction.
   Quantified impacts are limited to those resulting from activities
   performed within the FEFC process facilities (i.e. within the plant
   gates). Energy embodied in material inputs such as process chemicals and
   fuel cladding is identified but not explicitly quantified in this study.
   Inclusion of indirect energy associated with embodied energy as well as
   construction and decommissioning of facilities could increase the FEFC
   energy intensity estimate by a factor of up to 2. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   milling, and refining}},
Journal = {{ENERGY ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{911-926}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Land, water and energy use are key measures of the sustainability of
   uranium production into the future. As the most attractive, accessible
   deposits are mined out, future discoveries may prove to be
   significantly, perhaps unsustainably, more intensive consumers of
   environmental resources. A number of previous attempts have been made to
   provide empirical relationships connecting these environmental impact
   metrics to process variables such as stripping ratio and ore grade.
   These earlier attempts were often constrained by a lack of real world
   data and perform poorly when compared against data from modern
   operations. This paper conditions new empirical models of energy, water
   and land use in uranium mining, milling, and refining on contemporary
   data reported by operating mines. It shows that, at present, direct
   energy use from uranium production represents less than 1\% of the
   electrical energy produced by the once-through fuel cycle. Projections
   of future energy intensity from uranium production are also possible by
   coupling the empirical models with estimates of uranium crustal
   abundance, characteristics of new discoveries, and demand. The
   projections show that even for the most pessimistic of scenarios
   considered, by 2100, the direct energy use from uranium production
   represents less than 3\% of the electrical energy produced by the
   contemporary once-through fuel cycle. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Toward developing a new method for restoring tissue viscoelasticity in
   scarred vocal folds, we previously proposed a method to localize
   biomaterials within subepithelial voids ablated using ultrafast laser
   pulses. The clinical implementation of this method necessitates the
   quantification of the laser parameters for ablating scarred tissue.
   Here, we present a comprehensive study of these parameters including
   ablation threshold and bubble lifetime in healthy and scarred tissues.
   We also present a new method for extracting tissue-specific ablation
   threshold and scattering lengths of different tissue layers. This method
   involves finding the ablation threshold at multiple depths and solving
   the equations based on Beer's law of light attenuation for each depth to
   estimate the unknown parameters. Measured threshold fluences were 1.75
   J/cm(2) for vocal folds and 0.5 J/cm(2) for cheek pouches for 3-ps,
   776nm laser pulses. Scarred pouches exhibited 30\% lower threshold than
   healthy pouches, possibly due to the degraded mechanical properties of
   scarred collagen during wound healing. The analysis of tissue
   architecture indicated a direct correlation between the ablation
   threshold and tissue tensile strength and that the bubble lifetime is
   inversely related to tissue stiffness. Overall, this study sheds light
   on the required laser parameters for successful implementation of
   ultrafast laser ablation for phonosurgery. (C) 2013 Society of

Abstract = {{By signing a water sharing agreement (WSA), countries agree to release
   an amount of river water in exchange for a negotiated compensation. We
   examine the vulnerability of such agreements to reduced water flows.
   Among all WSAs that are acceptable to riparian countries, we find out
   the one which is self-enforced under the most severe drought scenarios.
   The so-called upstream incremental WSA assigns to each country its
   marginal contribution to its followers in the river. Its mirror image,
   the downstream incremental WSA, is not sustainable to reduced flow at
   the source. Self-enforcement problems can be solved by setting water
   releases and compensations contingent to water flow. We apply our
   analysis to the Aral Sea Basin. We compute the upstream incremental
   compensations for the Bishkek agreement and asses its vulnerability with

Abstract = {{We propose a virtual statistical validation process as an aid to the

   the behavior of material bodies, with focus on those cases in which
   knowledge of the fabrication process used to manufacture the body can
   provide information on the micro-molecular-scale properties underlying
   macroscale behavior. One example is given by models of elastomeric
   solids fabricated using polymerization processes. We describe a
   framework for model validation that involves Bayesian updates of
   parameters in statistical calibration and validation phases. The process
   enables the quantification of uncertainty in quantities of interest
   (QoIs) and the determination of model consistency using tools of
   statistical information theory. We assert that microscale information
   drawn from molecular models of the fabrication of the body provides a
   valuable source of prior information on parameters as well as a means

Abstract = {{Continuing our previous work {[}6, Inverse Problems, 2012, 28, 055002]
   and {[}5, Inverse Problems, 2012, 28, 055001], we address the
   ill-posedness of the inverse scattering problem of electromagnetic waves
   due to an inhomogeneous medium by studying the Hessian of the data
   misfit. We derive and analyze the Hessian in both Holder and Sobolev
   spaces. Using an integral equation approach based on Newton potential
   theory and compact embeddings in Holder and Sobolev spaces, we show that
   the Hessian can be decomposed into three components, all of which are
   shown to be compact operators. The implication of the compactness of the
   Hessian is that for small data noise and model error, the discrete
   Hessian can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. This in turn enables
   fast solution of an appropriately regularized inverse problem, as well
   as Gaussian-based quantification of uncertainty in the estimated
   inhomogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{To explain the dynamic behavior of the matric potential at the wetting

   angle theta(d). theta(d) depends on a number of factors including
   velocity of the water and can be found by the Hoffman-Jiang equation
   that was modified for gravity effects. By assuming that water at the
   wetting front imbibes one pore at a time, realistic velocities are
   obtained that can explain the capillary pressures observed in unstable

Title = {{Perceptually optimized blind repair of natural images}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10, SI}},
Pages = {{1478-1493}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We define the new idea of blind image repair as a process of correcting
   one or more different and unknown types of distortions afflicting an
   image. These distortions could introduce linear or non-linear
   degradations, compression artifacts, noise, etc., or combinations of
   these. Thus the concept encompasses denoising, deblurring, deblocking,
   deringing, and other post-acquisition image improvement processes that
   address distortions. The problem is distortion-blind when the natures of
   the distortion processes are unknown prior to analyzing the image.
   Towards solving this problem, we describe a new framework for repairing
   an image that has undergone an unknown set of distortions, based on
   identifying the distortion(s) present in the image (if any) and applying
   possibly multiple distortion-specific image repair algorithms. Our
   philosophy is based on the principle that the task of general purpose
   image repair is one of agglomeration, i.e., the algorithm should embody
   multiple high-performing distortion-specific repair modules such that
   seamless general purpose image repair is achieved. Our proposed
   framework - the GEneral-purpose No-reference Image Improver (GENII) -
   enables the design of algorithms that are blind to distortion type as
   well as to distortion parameters, and only requires as input the
   distorted image to be repaired. The GENII framework is modular and
   easily extensible to image repair problems beyond those considered here.
   GENII operates by using natural scene statistic models to identify
   distortion, to perceptually optimize the distortion parameter(s), to
   assess the quality of the intermediate repaired images, and to
   perceptually optimize the repair processes. We explain the general
   purpose image repair framework and one specific realization, dubbed
   GENII-1, which assumes that the image has been affected by one or more
   of four possible distortion types.The performance of GENII-1 is
   evaluated on 4000 distorted images, and shown to deliver substantial
   improvements in both quantitative and qualitative visual quality. (C)

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In fractured reservoirs, the efficiency of water flood is governed by
   spontaneous imbibition of water into oil-containing matrix blocks. When
   the matrix is oil-wet or mixed-wet, little oil can be recovered by
   imbibition. The objective of this work is to identify chemicals that can
   be added to the injection water that can induce imbibition into an
   originally mixed-wet, tight, fractured sandstone reservoir. Several
   surfactants were evaluated for their aqueous stability at the reservoir
   temperature and salinity. Contact angles were measured on a clay-rich
   sandstone. Spontaneous imbibition tests were conducted on the reservoir
   rocks. It is shown that the use of dilute (0.1 wt \%) anionic surfactant
   solution with a large number of ethoxy groups can alter the wettability
   from oil-wet toward more water-wet conditions on the mineral plates.
   Incremental oil recovery as high as 68\% original oil in place is
   obtained through spontaneous imbibition experiments performed on tight
   (similar to 10 mu D) oil-wet/mixed-wet sandstone reservoir cores. A
   three-dimensional fine grid mechanistic simulator was used to perform
   lab-scale validation and parametric analysis. Parametric studies show
   that the rate of oil recovery increases with increasing wettability
   alteration, increasing fracture density, and decreasing oil viscosity.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete's resistance to chloride diffusion is one of the primary
   factors governing the concrete structure service life and life-cycle
   costs. This paper presents a new model developed for estimating the
   apparent concrete diffusivity based on the mixture proportions,
   cementitious materials used, and concrete age. The model includes the
   effects of supplementary cementitious material types commonly found in
   other service life models such as fly ash, ground-granulated
   blast-furnace slag, and silica fume. Also included are ultra-fine fly
   ash and metakaolin, which were not available in previous service life
   models. For validation of the model, chloride profiles have been
   measured on concrete blocks exposed daily to seawater for 25 years at
   the Treat Island, ME concrete exposure site. Concrete mixtures tested as
   part of the validation dataset contained up-to 80\% ground-granulated
   blast-furnace slag, 25\% fly ash, or 20\% silica fume, and were compared

Abstract = {{Two high-chi block copolymers, lamella-forming
   poly(styrene-block-{[}isoprene-random-epoxyisoprene]) (PS-PEI78, with 78
   mol \% epoxidation) and lamella-forming
   poly(4-trimethylsilylstyrene-block-D,L-lactide) (PTMSS-PLA), were used
   to study three combinations of interfacial neutrality involving at least
   one neutral interface. PS-PEI78 annealed on a nonpreferential polymer
   mat (SMG) produced perpendicular lamellae independent of film thickness,
   indicating a neutral substrate and neutral free surface. In contrast,
   the presence of only one neutral interface results in the formation of
   surface topography ({''}islands{''} and ``holes{''}) with 0.5L(0) step
   heights. PS-PEI78 (neutral free surface) annealed on PS brush (PS block
   preferential) forms ``half' islands and holes. The inverse experiment,
   PTMSS-PLA (with a PTMSS preferential free surface) annealed on a neutral
   (or near neutral) substrate surface, also generates 0.5L(0) topography.
   These ``half' island and hole structures are stable to extended thermal
   annealing. PS-PEI78 exposes both blocks at the free surface in contrast
   to PTMSS-PLA, which exposes just one. All three combinations of
   interfacial neutrality are explained by the precise balancing of the
   wetting tendencies of the two blocks. Evolution of the 0.5L(0) motifs
   appears to be facilitated by a preference to form half-period thick
   nuclei in the initial stages of morphological development.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregate structure of covalently functionalized chiral specific
   semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was systematically
   studied employing static light scattering (SLS). Fractal dimensions
   (D-f) of two specific chirality SWNT5-SG65 and SG76 with (6, 5) and (7,
   6) chiral enrichments-were measured under four biological exposure media
   conditions, namely: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), Minimum
   Essential Medium (MEM), Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640
   medium, and 0.9\% saline solution. The SWNTs exhibited chiral dependence
   on Dr with SG65 showing more fractal or loosely bound aggregate
   structures, i.e., lower Df values (range of 2.24 +/- 0.03 to 2.64 +/-
   0.05), compared to the SG76 sample (range of 2.58 +/- 0.13 to 2.90 +/-
   0.08). All the Df values reported are highly reproducible, measured from
   multiple SLS runs and estimated with `random block-effects' statistical
   analysis that yielded all p values to be <0.001. The key mechanism for
   such difference in D-f between the SWNT samples was identified as the
   difference in van der Waals (VDW) interaction energies of these samples,
   where higher VOW of SG76 resulted in tighter packing density. Effect of
   medium type showed lower sensitivity; however, presence of di-valent
   cations (Ca2+) in DMEM and MEM media resulted in relatively loose or
   more fractal aggregates. Moreover, presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS)
   and bovine serum albumin (BSA), used to mimic the in vitro cell culture
   condition, reduced the Dr values, i.e., created more fractal structures.
   Steric hindrance to aggregation was identified as the key mechanism for
   creating the fractal structures. Also, increase in FBS concentration
   from 1\% to 10\% resulted in increasingly lower Df values. Published by

Abstract = {{This letter addresses a distributed rate allocation for a class of
   multicast networks employing linear network coding. The goal is to
   minimize the cost, e.g., the sum rate allocated to links in the network,
   while satisfying a multicast rate requirement for each users in the
   network. In essence, it aims to achieve the network capacity while
   ensuring that the operation cost is minimal. This letter uses an
   alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to obtain a
   distributed algorithm for the rate allocation. Simulation results
   demonstrate the convergence of this algorithm to the optimal solution.}},

   were generated by focusing a nanosecond pulsed laser beam and the
   displacement of each microbubble in response to an impulsive acoustic

   high-pulse-repetition-frequency ultrasound system. Based on measured
   dynamics of the microbubble, Young's modulus and shear viscosity at
   various locations of the vitreous were reconstructed. Young's moduli of

Abstract = {{Graphite anode is widely used in current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries
   due its high capacity and excellent cycling stability. A conventional
   graphite composite anode consists of graphite powder, carbon additive,
   and a polymer binder. To further increase the energy density of Li-ion
   batteries, alternative high capacity anode materials such as silicon are
   needed. Here, we report a hybrid anode consisting of silicon
   nanoparticles supported on a woven graphitic carbon paper. The
   structural carbon paper itself exhibits a specific capacity of 167 mAh
   g(-1) at a rate of C/40, while the silicon nanoparticles further
   increase the overall capacity of the electrode by similar to 10\% with a
   silicon loading of only 0.2 mg. The silicon in the hybrid electrode
   exhibits a specific capacity of similar to 1300 mAh g(-1) which
   decreases as the loading increases to 0.6 mg, but still showing good
   cyclability. The structural and morphological changes of graphite and
   silicon within the hybrid electrode during charge and discharge are also

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{427-436}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Using a fully coupled (flow and mechanics)
   hydraulic-fracture-propagation model, we investigate the critical
   in-situ and treatment factors controlling geometry in multiple-fracture
   horizontal wells. Fracture net pressure is calculated by considering
   continuity of flow rate and pressure equilibrium in the fracture and the
   wellbore between injection points. A 2D displacement-discontinuity
   method, with correction for finite fracture height, was used to
   calculate fracture aperture, accounting for mechanical interaction
   between multiple propagating fractures.
   Stress-shadow effects change the local stress field in the surrounding
   rock, influencing fracture geometry. A sensitivity study for
   simultaneous propagation was performed, including fracture spacing,
   velocity exponent, in-situ differential stress, fluid viscosity, and
   pump rate. The results show that closely spaced hydraulic fractures can
   cause significant fracture-width restriction, increasing the likelihood
   of premature screenout. Exterior fractures have greater lengths than
   interior fractures, and the length difference is more significant for
   poor injection control. At a low in-situ differential stress, multiple
   fractures tend to extend away from one another to reduce the negative
   mechanical interaction; however, increasing the stress difference can
   make fractures propagate along a straight line. Compared with gel
   hydraulic-fracturing treatments, slickwater treatments generate narrower
   and much longer fractures with lower net pressure. In the case of
   simultaneously generating multiple fractures, these slickwater fractures
   cause less mechanical interference with each other. Increasing pump rate
   enlarges fracture width slightly and reduces the length. Finally,
   simultaneous and sequential injection methods were examined showing that
   these two methods create slightly distinct fracture trajectories.}},

Title = {{Multiple input multiple output controller design to match chamber
   performance in plasma etching for semiconductor manufacturing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In semiconductor manufacturing, multiple chambers utilized for the same
   process step often experience performance variation. This chamber to
   chamber performance variation has affected the yield of wafers, but
   there are no standard procedures to reduce them in semiconductor
   manufacturing. This paper introduces chamber matching in plasma etching
   as one of the core issues in semiconductor manufacturing and suggests a
   step-by-step procedure to address chamber matching issues. A brief
   review of two approaches, fault detection and classification and
   equipment control, is given and a step-by-step procedure of the
   equipment control approach is introduced. To design a multiple
   input-multiple output controller, a decomposed etch rate map makes it
   possible to analyze etch rate performance between chambers and to define
   controlled variables. Optimum variable selection techniques, such as
   singular value analysis and relative gain array methods, and dynamic
   optimization with constraints are suggested in this paper. In addition,
   a performance matching index (PMI) is introduced to calculate
   performance of chambers in terms of both etch rate and wafer yield to
   verify the matching capability of our approach. PMI is a quantitative
   index, which calculates performance of two chambers and lower value is
   better. By applying our approach, the performance of a worst chamber
   reaches to that of a golden chamber, resulting in PMI improvement from
   100.7 to 31.6. The methodology of chamber matching introduced in this
   paper should be useful to semiconductor manufacturers impacted by
   chamber matching issues. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{A microdevice was used to measure the in-plane thermoelectric properties
   of suspended bismuth telluride nanoplates from 9 to 25 nm thick. The
   results reveal a suppressed Seebeck coefficient together with a general
   trend of decreasing electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity
   with decreasing thickness. While the electrical conductivity of the
   nanoplates is still within the range reported for bulk Bi2Te3, the total
   thermal conductivity for nanoplates less than 20 nm thick is well below
   the reported bulk range. These results are explained by the presence of
   surface band bending and diffuse surface scattering of electrons and
   phonons in the nanoplates, where pronounced n-type surface band bending
   can yield suppressed and even negative Seebeck coefficient in
   unintentionally p-type doped nanoplates.}},

Abstract = {{Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data reveal that superlattices of

   hexagonal close-packed structure, followed by the formation of binary
   simple cubic AB(13) and hexagonal AB(5) superlattices. Ultimately the
   superlattice decomposes at high temperature to bicontinuous domains of
   coalesced Au and intervening hydrocarbon. Transmission electron
   microscopy revealed that the ordered structure transformations result
   from partial ligand desorption and controlled Au nanocrystal growth
   during heating, which forces changes in superlattice symmetry. These
   observations suggest some similarity between organic ligand-coated
   nanocrystals and microphase-segregated diblock copolymers, where
   thermally induced nanophase-segregation of Au and organic ligand

Abstract = {{Recently, a number of experiments have demonstrated that addition of
   ceramics with nanoscale dimensions can lead to substantial improvements
   in the low-temperature conductivity of the polymeric materials. However,
   the origin of such behaviors and, more generally, the manner by which
   nanoscale fillers impact the ion mobilities remain unresolved. In this
   communication, we report the results of atomistic molecular dynamics
   simulations which used multibody polarizable force fields to study
   lithium ion diffusivities in an amorphous poly(ethylene-oxide) (PEO)
   melt containing well-dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles. We observed that the
   lithium ion diffusivities decrease with increased particle loading. Our
   analysis suggests that the ion mobilities are correlated to the
   nanoparticle-induced changes in the polymer segmental dynamics.
   Interestingly, the changes in polymer segmental dynamics were seen to be
   related to the nanoparticle's influence on the polymer conformational
   features. Overall, our results indicate that addition of nanoparticle
   fillers modifies polymer conformations and the polymer segmental
   dynamics and thereby influence the ion mobilities of polymer
   electrolytes.}},

   frequency-scanned beam of the MLWA and its frequency bandwidth during
   the beam dwell are exploited to achieve simultaneous bearing estimation
   and ranging within a single frequency sweep. As a result, 2-D
   range-azimuth images can be readily generated with a high refresh rate.
   The radar processing algorithm is developed and tested using point
   scatterer simulations. Stationary trihedral and human tracking
   measurements are carried out to demonstrate the concept. In addition, an
   L1-norm minimization algorithm is applied to improve the resulting

Abstract = {{Modern design and manufacturing methodologies for magnesium (Mg) sheet
   panels require formability data for use in computer-aided design and
   computer-aided engineering tools. To meet this need, forming-limit
   diagrams (FLDs) for AZ31B and ZEK100 wrought Mg alloy sheets were
   developed at elevated temperatures for strain rates of 10(-3) and 10(-2)
   s(-1). The elevated temperatures investigated range from 250 to 450 A
   degrees C for AZ31B and 300 to 450 A degrees C for ZEK100. The FLDs were
   generated using data from uniaxial tension, biaxial bulge, and
   plane-strain bulge tests, all carried out until specimen rupture. The
   unique aspect of this study is that data from materials with consistent
   processing histories were produced using consistent testing techniques
   across all test conditions. The ZEK100 alloy reaches greater major true
   strains at rupture, by up to 60\%, than the AZ31B alloy for all strain
   paths at all temperatures and strain rates examined. Formability limits
   decrease only slightly with a decrease in temperature, less than 30\%
   decrease for AZ31B and less than 35\% decrease for ZEK100 as the
   temperature decreases from 450 to 300 A degrees C. This suggests that
   forming processes at 250-300 A degrees C are potentially viable for
   manufacturing complex Mg components.}},

Abstract = {{More than 2300 sediment pore water distribution coefficients (K-PCBi

   from sediments from Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal. K-PCBi (ds) were

   PDMS-fiber and Sigma PCB ranged from 41 to 1500 ng L-1. The resulting
   K-PCBi ds were similar to 1 log unit lower in comparison to other
   reported values. A simple model for the K-PCBi (d) consisted of the
   product of the organic carbon fraction and the octanol water partition
   coefficient and provided an excellent prediction for the measured
   values, with a mean square error of 0.09 +/- 0.06. Although black carbon
   content is very high in these sediments and was expected to play an
   important role in the distribution of PCBs, no improvement was obtained

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{183-188}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study is interested in determining the experimental relation
   between the suction pressure and evaporation rate from the upper surface
   of a flat, thin porous membrane, which naturally draws water from a
   reservoir, and its microchannel feeding system. The effects of three
   main design parameters of a water delivery system on the evaporation
   rate of the membrane are considered: (i) the diameter of the
   microchannels irrigating the membrane, (ii) the length of the irrigating
   microchannels, and (iii) the surface area of the membrane. Additionally,
   we also evaluated the effect of the pumping height (i.e., the vertical
   distance between the membrane and the main reservoir) on the evaporation
   rates for the three design parameters. While the maximum evaporation
   rate from the membrane is a function of the membrane's properties (e.g.,
   permeability and porosity), as well as the ambient conditions (e.g.,
   temperature, pressure and humidity), this study focused on determining
   the geometric parameters of closed water-feeding microchannels that
   properly hydrate a porous membrane while not impeding evaporation.
   Results indicated that the evaporation rate was mostly unaffected by the
   channel dimensions considered. Moreover, evaporation rates increased
   with increasing surface area (between 20.3 cm(2) and 176.7 cm(2)) but at
   a decreasing rate of return. Finally, the suction pressures achieved
   were inversely related to hydrodynamic pressure drop and were unaffected
   by the membrane diameter. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Today, the majority of semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) conduct
   equipment preventive maintenance based on statistically-derived time- or
   wafer-count-based intervals. While these practices have had relative
   success in managing equipment availability and product yield, the cost,
   both in time and materials, remains high. Condition-based maintenance
   has been successfully adopted in several industries, where costs
   associated with equipment downtime range from potential loss of life to
   unacceptable affects to companies' bottom lines. In this paper, we
   present a method for the monitoring of complex systems in the presence
   of multiple operating regimes. In addition, the new representation of
   degradation processes will be used to define an optimization procedure
   that facilitates concurrent maintenance and operational decision-making
   in a manufacturing system. This decision-making procedure
   metaheuristically maximizes a customizable cost function that reflects
   the benefits of production uptime, and the losses incurred due to
   deficient quality and downtime. The new degradation monitoring method is
   illustrated through the monitoring of a deposition tool operating over a
   prolonged period of time in a major fab, while the operational
   decision-making is demonstrated using simulated operation of a generic
   cluster tool.}},

Abstract = {{A tertiary alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) pilot flood was implemented
   during 2010 in the Illinois basin of the US, and is continuing
   currently. With initial discovery of the Bridgeport sandstone formation
   in the early 1900s and more than 60 years of waterflooding, the pilot
   was designed to demonstrate that ASP flooding could produce sufficient
   quantities of incremental oil to sanction a commercial project.
   Laboratory experiments, including corefloods, were performed to
   determine the optimal chemical formulation for the pilot and to provide
   essential parameters for a numerical-simulation model.
   Polymer-injectivity tests, single well chemical tracer tests (SWCTTs),
   and an interwell-tracer-test (TWIT) program were all performed to
   prepare for and support a full interpretation of the pilot results. A
   field laboratory was run through the duration of the pilot to monitor
   the quality of the injection and production fluids, which turned out to
   be critical to the success of the pilot. We present the results and
   interpretation of the ASP pilot to date, the challenges faced during the
   project, and the lessons learned from the field perspective.}},

   design procedures based on different rationales. The results of the
   examination revealed that design expressions based on the Modified
   Compression Field. Theory (MCFT) yielded the most accurate shear
   strength estimations for prestressed concrete members that failed in
   typical shear failure modes. Most of the unconservative estimations that
   resulted from the use of the MCFT-based design expressions were observed
   in specimens that failed in shear but exhibited signs of horizontal
   shear damage or anchorage zone distress. Although the ACI 318-11
   detailed method provided slightly less-conservative estimations than the
   MCFT-based design expressions, these estimations were more accurate than
   those obtained by using other empirical shear design equations.}},

Abstract = {{In many reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures designed before issues
   related to progressive collapse became important, it was common to have
   continuous negative reinforcement through a column but to have
   discontinuous positive reinforcement. To provide toughness to such
   frames under extreme loading, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   materials can be installed on the side faces of an RC beam parallel to
   discontinuous longitudinal reinforcement. The CFRP sheets provide
   continuity and improve integrity. However, CFRP sheets cannot develop
   their tensile capacity because they will delaminate from the concrete.
   In this study, the use of anchorage techniques for CFRP materials on the
   side faces of RC beams was experimentally investigated. Ten RC beams
   were tested to examine the effectiveness of the anchorage methods using
   CFRP anchors and/or U-wraps. The test results show that the tensile
   strength of CFRP sheets was realized if they were anchored by a
   combination of CFRP U-wraps and anchors.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of characterizing a generalized Voronoi diagram
   that is relevant to a special class of area assignment problems for
   multi-vehicle systems. It is assumed that the motion of each vehicle is
   described by a second order mechanical system with time-varying linear
   or affine dynamics. The proposed generalized Voronoi diagram encodes
   information regarding the proximity relations between the vehicles and
   arbitrary target points in the plane. These proximity relations are
   induced by an anisotropic (generalized) distance function that
   incorporates the vehicle dynamics. In particular, the generalized
   distance is taken to be the minimum control effort required for the
   transition of a vehicle to an arbitrary target point with a small
   terminal speed at a fixed final time. The space we wish to partition
   corresponds to the union of all the terminal positions that can be
   attained by each vehicle using finite control effort. Consequently, the
   partition space has lower dimension than the state space of each
   vehicle. We show that, in the general case, the solution to the proposed
   partitioning problem can be associated with a power Voronoi diagram
   generated by a set of spheres in a five-dimensional Euclidean space for
   the computation of which efficient techniques exist in the relevant
   literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 has been investigated extensively as an active resistive switching

   single-crystal anatase-TiO2 thin films fabricated on silicon by atomic

   behavior with a record high ON/OFF ratio (similar to 10(7)) and low
   leakage current in the high-resistance state. The switching
   characteristics resemble those of electrochemical memories via formation
   and dissolution of conductive filaments (CFs) composed of oxygen
   vacancies, and small numbers of quantized channels are reproducibly
   observed in the low-resistance state, consistent with quantized
   conductance (QC) found in conventional electrolytic systems and
   indicating its potential for forming ultrathin CF amenable to device
   scaling. A detailed analysis of QC and contact resistance is presented.
   The emergence of QC is believed to be related to the single-crystal

Abstract = {{The dynamics of complex diseases are governed by intricate interactions
   of myriad factors. Drug combinations, formed by mixing several
   single-drug treatments at various doses, can enhance the effectiveness
   of the therapy by targeting multiple contributing factors. The main
   challenge in designing drug combinations is the highly nonlinear
   interaction of the constituent drugs. Prior work focused on guided
   space-exploratory heuristics that require discretization of drug doses.
   While being more efficient than random sampling, these methods are
   impractical if the drug space is high dimensional or if the drug
   sensitivity is unknown. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the obtained
   combinations may decrease if the resolution of the discretization grid
   is not sufficiently fine. In this paper, we model the biological system
   response to a continuous combination of drug doses by a Gaussian process
   (GP). We perform closed-loop experiments that rely on the expected
   improvement criterion to efficiently guide the exploration process
   toward drug combinations with the optimal response. When computing the
   criterion, we marginalize out the GP hyperparameters in a fully Bayesian
   manner using a particle filter. Finally, we employ a hybrid Monte Carlo
   algorithm to rapidly explore the high-dimensional continuous search
   space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a fully
   factorial Drosophila dataset, an antiviral drug dataset for Herpes
   simplex virus type 1, and simulated human Apoptosis networks. The
   results show that our approach significantly reduces the number of
   required trials compared to existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we target arginine auxotrophy of AML cell lines using
   human arginase I cobalt-PEG5000. HuArgI(Co)-PEG5000 was cytotoxic to all
   AML cell lines tested. Mononuclear cells and CD34+ blasts were not
   sensitive demonstrating the selectivity of HuArgI(Co)-PEG5000-induced
   arginine deprivation. Addition of l-citrulline led to the rescue of five
   cell lines. The four cell lines that were not rescued by l-citrulline
   did not express argininosuccinate synthetase-1, indicating complete
   arginine auxotrophy. Inhibition of autophagy increased cell sensitivity
   to HuArgI(Co)-PEG5000 demonstrating the protective role of autophagy
   following arginine deprivation.
   We have shown that AML can be selectively targeted using

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test has been a widely used
   non-destructive testing method for concrete structures. However, the
   conventional UPV test has limitations in consistency of results and
   applicability in hard-to-access regions of structures. The authors
   explore the feasibility of embedded piezoelectric (PZT) sensors for
   ultrasonic measurements in concrete structures. Two PZT sensors were
   embedded in a reinforced concrete specimen. One sensor worked as an
   actuator driven by an ultrasonic pulse-receiver, and another sensor
   worked as a receiver. A series of ultrasonic tests were conducted to
   investigate the performance of the embedded sensors in crack-free
   concrete and concrete specimens having a surface-breaking crack under
   various external loadings. Signals measured by the embedded sensors show
   a broad bandwidth with a centre frequency around 80 kHz, and very good
   coherence in the frequency range from 30 to 180 kHz. Furthermore,
   experimental variability in ultrasonic pulse velocity and attenuation is
   substantially reduced compared to previously reported values from
   conventional UPV equipment. Findings from this study demonstrate that
   the embedded sensors have great potential as a low-cost solution for
   ultrasonic transducers for health monitoring of concrete in structures.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous paper (Dehghanpour et al., Phys Rev E 83:065302, 2011a),
   we showed that relative permeability of mobilized oil, , measured during
   tertiary gravity drainage, is significantly higher than that of the same
   oil saturation in other tests where oil is initially a continuous phase.
   We also showed that tertiary strongly correlates to both water
   saturation, , water flux (water relative permeability), , and the change
   in water saturation with time, . To develop a model and understanding of
   the enhanced oil transport, identifying which of these parameters (, or
   ) plays the controlling role is necessary, but in the previous
   experiments these could not be deconvolved. To answer the remaining
   question, we conduct specific three-phase displacement experiments in
   which is controlled by applying a fixed water influx, and develops
   naturally. We obtain by using the saturation data measured in time and
   space. The results suggest that steady-state water influx, in contrast
   to transient water displacement, does not enhance . Instead, reducing
   water influx rate results in excess oil flow. Furthermore, according to
   our pore scale hydraulic conductivity calculations, viscous coupling and
   fluid positioning do not sufficiently explain the observed correlation
   between and . We conclude that tertiary is controlled by the oil
   mobilization rate, which in turn is linked to the rate of water
   saturation decrease with time, . Finally, we develop a simple model
   which relates tertiary to transient two-phase gas/water relative
   permeability.}},

   feature is perhaps the proposition of chirality-dependent concepts of
   effective thickness and effective radius, whose evaluation is achieved
   in terms of nanoscopic information; moreover, as shown in the companion

   process. Based on the improved simulation method proposed in the Part I
   of this paper, the impacts of correlated LER/LWR in the channel of

Abstract = {{Compressed-air energy storage (CAES) is considered a promising energy
   storage system for many grid applications, including managing renewable
   variability and grid capacity concerns. However, compared with
   conventional generation such as coal or hydro, the cost of storage power
   of CAES is still high, which impedes its deployment. Therefore a
   standing question is how to operate CAES in the most efficient and
   economical fashion, that is, to exploit the system functions for
   maximum-possible benefit. This study investigates the CAES dynamic
   reactive capability used to stabilise wind farms under grid fault
   conditions. Two considered operation modes are motor mode with leading
   power factor and synchronous condenser mode. Analysis with a 60-MW wind
   farm and two types of popular wind turbines, namely stall-regulated and
   doubly fed induction-generator-based WTs, shows that the CAES
   performance is comparable or better than that of an static var
   compensator in most situations investigated. Therefore the
   reactive-power-supply function should be considered in CAES design and
   operation to increase the system efficiency and value.}},

Abstract = {{Administration of Isuprel/Adenosine After PulmonaryVein Antrum Isolation
   BackgroundPulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) remains associated with
   atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence. We administered adenosine and
   isoproterenol (ISP) after PVAI to uncover non-PV atrial triggers and PV
   reconnection, potentially increasing ablation success rate.
   MethodsOne hundred and ninety-two consecutive patients with symptomatic
   AF presenting for PVAI were prospectively studied (group 1). Following
   PVAI, adenosine (18-24 mg) and ISP (20-30 mcg/min) were administered
   intravenously. Supplemental ablation was performed in patients with
   non-PV triggers that induced AF (group 1A). Other subgroups included
   patients with (group 1B) or without (group 1C) consistent non-PV atrial
   foci that did not induce AF. A cohort of 196 matched control patients
   undergoing PVAI without drug challenge was used for comparison (group
   2).
   ResultsA total of 132 atrial non-PV foci were revealed (31 inducing AF).
   The majority of atrial foci were observed with ISP (113/132, 86\%). Less
   than 5\% of patients had persistent PV recovery during the drug
   challenge. During a mean follow-up of 22 8 months, PVAI was successful
   in 110/192 (57\%, group 1) versus 100/196 (52\%, group 2), P = 0.038.
   Furthermore, the success rate was statistically different between group
   1A (25/32, 78\%), group 1B (28/83, 34\%), and group 1C (57/74, 74\%), P
   < 0.001.
   ConclusionAfter PVAI, ablation guided by the administration of adenosine
   and ISP to target non-PV triggers inducing AF increased AF ablation
   outcomes. Patients with non-PV foci that did not induce AF had no
   further ablation, with the lowest ablation success rate. This group may
   likely benefit from further ablation after PVAI.}},

Abstract = {{AF Ablation in Patients with Large LA
   IntroductionThe effect of catheter ablation on severe left atrial
   enlargement especially in nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation (NPAF)
   patients is not well understood. Whether reverse remodelling may occur
   after ablation has not been evaluated in this setting.
   Methods and resultsFifty consecutive patients with left atrial diameter
   (LAD) 50mm, and LA volume >200 cc undergoing catheter ablation for
   drug-refractory NPAF were included in this study. Transthoracic
   echocardiographic measurements were performed at baseline and at
   12-months postprocedure. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic
   dimensions were indexed by body surface area (LVEDDI, LVESDI).
   Electroanatomic mapping system (Carto or NavX system) and computed
   tomography (CT) were used for 3-dimensional reconstruction of the LA.
   All patients underwent posterior wall isolation and pulmonary vein (PV)
   antrum and extra PV trigger ablations. Long-term follow-up was monitored
   by event recordings, 7-day Holter monitors and office visits. The mean
   age was 6510 years, 78\% male, persistent AF 22 (44\%), longstanding AF
   28 (56\%), LAD diameter 56.9 +/- 7.8 mm, left ventricular ejection
   fraction (LVEF) 53 +/- 14 and median AF duration 72 (49-96) months. At
   12-month follow-up, 27 patients (54\%) remained arrhythmia-free off
   antiarrhythmic drugs. Significant reduction in LAD at follow-up (10\%
   reduction) was observed in 52\% (26/50) of the total population and
   among the 63\% (17/27) of recurrence-free patients. Magnitude of LA
   reduction was identically distributed among the persistent and
   longstanding persistent AF cohorts (16 +/- 12\% vs 14 +/- 16\%,
   respectively, P= 0.15). A significant 20\% improvement in LVEF (from 53
   +/- 14 to 58 +/- 9, P = 0.03) was found in the overall population.
   Improvement was noted in recurrence-free patients. No significant change
   in LVEDDI and LVESDI was noted. After adjusting for baseline risk
   factors in a multivariable model, a reduction in LAD was identified as a
   strong predictor of long-term success (beta = -11.1, P = 0.013).
   Preexisting LA scarring was associated with increased LAD (beta = 2.7, P
   = 0.023). No periprocedural or long-term complications were reported.
   ConclusionOur results show that atrial fibrillation ablation is
   effective in NPAF patients with severe LA enlargement and is associated
   with LA reverse remodeling and improvement in LVEF.}},

Abstract = {{Typical calibration of solid environmental samples for the determination
   of Ra-226, Ra-228 and Pb-210 entails the use of standard reference
   materials which have a very similar matrix. However, TENORM samples from
   the oil and gas exploration contain unusually high amounts of calcium,
   strontium and barium which can severely attenuate the photons of Pb-210
   and Ra-226 with their characteristic 46.1 keV and 186.2 key gamma-rays,
   respectively and to some extent Ra-228 with the characteristic
   gamma-rays of 911.2 keV and 969.0 keV. We used neutron activation
   analysis to evaluate the content of TENORM for calcium, barium and
   strontium and then used a software program SELABS to determine the
   self-absorption. Our results confirm that even in Petrie (R) containers
   with small dimensions the Pb-210 can be underestimated by almost by a
   factor of four while Ra-226 can be underestimated by 5\%. The Ra-228
   activities are virtually unaffected due to the higher energy gamma-rays.
   However, the implications for TENORM studies that employ large Marinelli
   (R) containers having sample sizes between 0.25 and 1.0 L may be
   severely compromised by the presence of high Z elements in elevated
   concentrations. The usual spectral interferences on Ra-226, Ra-228 and
   Pb-210 coming from other radionuclides in the U-254, U-235 and U-238
   decay chains are virtually nonexistent due the very high activity levels
   of Ra-226, Ra-228 and Pb-210 in the tens of thousands of Bq/kg. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the indirect impact of IT use via work processes
   on construction project performance in the industrial sector.
   Specifically, using the project-level data in the Construction Industry
   Institute Benchmarking and Metrics database, the overall impact of 3D
   CAD use, including the direct impact of the use to project cost growth
   and its indirect impact via CII designated Best Practice(s), is tested
   by path analysis. The analysis results show that the direct impact of 3D
   CAD use on project cost growth is not statistically significant. On the
   other hand, the indirect impact of 3D CAD use via Best Practice(s) is
   statistically significant. Interpreting the path values reveal that the
   use of 3D CAD contributes to more use of Best Practice(s), which in turn
   leads to cost performance improvement. This finding highlights the

   Using this approach, the domain is partitioned into two sub-domains in
   which the different methods are used for the numerical solution. The
   discretization is based on a monolithic solver in which finite
   differences are used for temporal integration and a Galerkin finite

Abstract = {{Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chips have become the most popular
   actuators, particularly for droplet-based digital microfluidic biochip
   (DMFB) systems. In order to enable the electrical manipulations, wire
   routing is a key problem in designing EWOD chips. Unlike traditional
   very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) routing problems, in addition to
   routing-path establishment on signal pins, the pin-constrained EWOD-chip
   routing problem must address the issue of signal sharing for pin-count
   reduction under a practical constraint posed by a limited pin-count
   supply. Moreover, EWOD-chip designs might incur several obstacles in the
   routing region due to embedded devices for specific fluidic protocols.
   However, no existing work considers the EWOD-chip routing with obstacles
   and, therefore, lots of manual design efforts are involved. To remedy
   this insufficiency, we propose in this paper the first routing algorithm
   for pin-constrained EWOD chips with obstacle avoidance. The proposed
   algorithm, based on effective integer-linear-programming (ILP)
   formulation as well as efficient routing framework, can achieve high
   routability with a low design complexity. Experimental results based on
   real-life chips with obstacles demonstrate the high routability of
   proposed algorithm for pin-constrained EWOD chips with obstacle
   avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{Planetary soft landing is one of the benchmark problems of optimal
   control theory and is gaining renewed interest due to the increased
   focus on the exploration of planets in the solar system, such as Mars.
   The soft landing problem with all relevant constraints can be posed as a
   finite-horizon optimal control problem with state and control
   constraints. The real-time generation of fuel-optimal paths to a
   prescribed location on a planet's surface is a challenging problem due
   to the constraints on the fuel, the control inputs, and the states. The
   main difficulty in solving this constrained problem is the existence of
   nonconvex constraints on the control input, which are due to a nonzero
   lower bound on the control input magnitude and a nonconvex constraint on
   its direction. This paper introduces a convexification of the control
   constraints that is proven to be lossless; i.e., an optimal solution of
   the soft landing problem can be obtained via solution of the proposed
   convex relaxation of the problem. The lossless convexification enables
   the use of interior point methods of convex optimization to obtain
   optimal solutions of the original nonconvex optimal control problem.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of estimating a signal corrupted by independent
   interference with the assistance of a cost-constrained helper who knows
   the interference causally or non-causally. When the interference is
   known causally, we characterize the minimum distortion incurred in
   estimating the desired signal. In the noncausal case, we present a
   general achievable scheme for discrete memoryless systems and novel
   lower bounds on the distortion for the binary and Gaussian settings. Our
   Gaussian setting coincides with that of assisted interference
   suppression introduced by Grover and Sahai. Our lower bound for this
   setting is based on the relation recently established by Verdu between
   divergence and minimum mean squared error. We illustrate with a few
   examples that this lower bound can improve on those previously
   developed. Our bounds also allow us to characterize the optimal
   distortion in several interesting regimes. Moreover, we show that causal
   and noncausal estimation are not equivalent for this problem. Finally,
   we consider the case where the desired signal is also available at the
   helper. We develop new lower bounds for this setting that improve on
   those previously developed, and characterize the optimal distortion up
   to a constant multiplicative factor for some regimes of interest.}},

Abstract = {{The k-distribution method for treating the spectral properties of an
   absorbing-emitting medium represents an alternative to line-by-line
   calculations. It reduces the number of RTE evaluations from the order of
   a million to the order of ten without any significant loss of accuracy.
   For problems where an appropriate reference temperature can be defined,
   the k-distribution method is formally exact. However, when no
   appropriate reference temperature can be defined, the method results in
   errors. There have been several attempts to implement corrections to the
   k-distribution method to extend its application to inhomogeneous media
   by modeling the effects of temperature, pressure, and concentration
   gradient. Some of these techniques are effective at reducing these
   errors, but none successfully extend the k-distribution method to
   inhomogeneous media in a way that retains the analytical guarantee of
   line-by-line accuracy. The Multi-Source Full Spectrum K-Distribution
   Method (MSFSK) introduced here manages to attain this goal for
   1-dimensional domains with piecewise constant temperature distributions
   by applying the superposition principle to the original RTE before
   applying the k-distribution transformation to decompose the problem into
   a set of sub-problems each of which is able to be solved exactly via the
   ordinary or modified full spectrum k-distribution method. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The main advantage of organic or polymer solar cells is their
   compatibility with conventional printing and coating techniques, making
   them highly cost-effective and suitable for large scale manufacturing.
   This work describes a simple, scalable, low-cost platform designed to
   test polymer solar cell devices. Custom built instrumentation and
   software were developed to analyze the current-voltage characteristics
   and quantum efficiency (QE) of the solar cells. The test set-up is
   modular and can be adapted to test solar cells under varying atmospheres
   (inert and ambient). The solar energy source comprises of an Oriel 91160
   300W class C solar simulator with air mass (AM) 1.5G filter for spectral
   shaping and solar intensity variation between 1 and 3 suns. Custom
   software developed using LABVIEW allows for testing to be carried out at
   high speeds reproducibly with minimal operator intervention.
   Software-controlled timer functionality allows programmable testing of
   solar cells over durations ranging from seconds to days, allowing for
   the evaluation of solar cell operational lifetimes. The facile design of
   the test set-up presented here provides an opportunity for different
   laboratories to set-up similar systems and tweak them for performing a

Abstract = {{Cold-formed steel stud walls are an attractive alternative to wooden
   stud walls because of their ductility, sustainability, and resistance to
   insects, mold, and rot. To date, engineers have faced challenges using
   steel stud walls to mitigate blast loads because of strict response
   limits set forth by existing standards that address blast-resistant
   design. Because of the limited past research on the response of steel
   stud walls subject to blasts, uncertainties exist regarding how these
   systems transition from elastic to inelastic response, particularly when
   lateral torsional buckling or local buckling of a section occurs.
   Existing standards used to design structures to mitigate blast loads
   penalize the use of steel stud walls by incorporating large safety
   factors that make the design of these systems uneconomical, which
   prevents engineers from taking full advantage of their benefits. The
   goal of the research described in this paper is to evaluate the
   suitability of conventional construction techniques to design and build
   steel stud walls that are capable of resisting blast effects associated
   with common threat scenarios. The work carried out to meet this goal
   included four controlled series of laboratory experiments. Results from
   this study demonstrate that the overall stiffness and strength of steel
   stud walls can be significantly greater than the values currently
   indicated in available design guidelines and that steel stud walls can
   be utilized to resist blast threats using conventional construction
   methods that add little cost to traditional designs.}},

Abstract = {{How long does it take to equilibrate the unfolded state of a protein?
   The answer to this question has important implications for our
   understanding of why many small proteins fold with two state kinetics.
   When the equilibration within the unfolded state U is much faster than
   the folding, the folding kinetics will be two state even if there are
   many folding pathways with different barriers. Yet the mean first
   passage times (MFPTs) between different regions of the unfolded state
   can be much longer than the folding time. This seems to imply that the
   equilibration within U is much slower than the folding. In this
   communication we resolve this paradox. We present a formula for
   estimating the time to equilibrate the unfolded state of a protein. We
   also present a formula for the MFPT to any state within U, which is
   proportional to the average lifetime of that state divided by the state
   population. This relation is valid when the equilibration within U is
   very fast as compared with folding as it often is for small proteins. To
   illustrate the concepts, we apply the formulas to estimate the time to
   equilibrate the unfolded state of Trp-cage and MFPTs within the unfolded
   state based on a Markov State Model using an ultra-long 208 microsecond
   trajectory of the miniprotein to parameterize the model. The time to
   equilibrate the unfolded state of Trp-cage is similar to 100ns while the
   typical MFPTs within U are tens of microseconds or longer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses real-time monitoring of the precipitable water
   vapor (PWV) from GNSS measurements and presents some results obtained
   from 6-month long GNSS PWV experiments using international and domestic
   GNSS networks. In the real-time GNSS PWV monitoring system a
   server/client structure is employed to facilitate formation of PWV
   networks and single-differenced GNSS measurements are utilized to
   mitigate errors in GNSS satellites' orbits and clocks. An issue relating
   to baseline length between the server and clients is discussed in detail
   and as a result the PWV monitor is configured to perform in two modes
   depending on the baseline length. The server estimates sequentially the
   zenith wet delay of the individual stations, which is then converted
   into the PWV of the stations. We evaluate system performance by
   comparing the real-time PWV solution with reference solutions including
   meteorological measurements obtained with radiosondes and deferred-time
   precision GNSS PWV solutions. Results showed that the standard deviation
   of difference between the real-time PWV and the reference solutions
   ranged from 2.1 to 3.4 mm in PWV for a 6-month long comparison, which
   was improved to 1.4 to 2.9 mm by reducing comparison period to 20 days

Abstract = {{The influence of the cellular environment on the structures and
   properties of catalytic RNAs is not well understood, despite great
   interest in ribozyme function. Here we report on ribosome association of
   group II introns, which are ribozymes that are important because of
   their putative ancestry to spliceosomal introns and retrotransposons,
   their retromobility via an RNA intermediate, and their application as
   gene delivery agents. We show that group II intron RNA, in complex with
   the intron-encoded protein from the native Lactoccocus lactis host,
   associates strongly with ribosomes in vivo. Ribosomes have little effect
   on intron ribozyme activities; rather, the association with host
   ribosomes protects the intron RNA against degradation by RNase E, an
   enzyme previously shown to be a silencer of retromobility in Escherichia
   coli. The ribosome interacts strongly with the intron, exerting
   protective effects in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by genetic and
   biochemical experiments. These results are consistent with the ribosome
   influencing the integrity of catalytic RNAs in bacteria in the face of
   degradative nucleases that regulate intron mobility.}},

   platelets. Generation of hydrogen at the G-O/Al interface increases the
   reduction efficiency of this method that is demonstrated in better
   electrical conductivity of the obtained films compared to the RG-O films
   reduced by the similar method but using remote Al foil in HCl solution
   and hydrazine reduced RG-O films. By transferring the free standing RG-O
   films onto Ag NW films, hybrid transparent conductive films (TCFs) with
   opto-electrical properties comparable to that of ITO films were

Abstract = {{The relationship between electrical conductivity, structure and

   biocomposites has been analyzed. To test the film's antimicrobial
   activity, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were studied. The
   interactions between silver nanoparticles with chitosan suggest the
   formation of silver ions which plays a major role in nanocomposite's
   bactericidal potency. In CS/AgnP biocomposites, the bactericide
   effectiveness increases by increasing AgnP concentrations up to 3 wt\%,
   which is close to the electrical percolation threshold of ca. 3 wt\%. As
   the AgnP concentration increases above this threshold, the bactericidal
   potency is greatly diminished. The elucidated correlation between
   electrical conductivity and antibacterial activity could be useful in
   the design of other nanocomposites that involve polymeric-based
   matrices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new abnormal grain growth phenomenon that occurs only during
   continuous plastic straining, termed dynamic abnormal grain growth
   (DAGG), was observed in molybdenum (Mo) at elevated temperature. DAGG
   was produced in two commercial-purity molybdenum sheets and in a
   commercial-purity molybdenum wire. Single crystals, centimeters in
   length, were created in these materials through the DAGG process. DAGG
   was observed only at temperatures of 1713 K (1440 A degrees C) and above
   and occurred across the range of strain rates investigated, similar to
   10(-5) to 10(-4) s(-1). DAGG initiates only after a critical plastic
   strain, which decreases with increasing temperature but is insensitive
   to strain rate. Following initiation of an abnormal grain, the rate of
   boundary migration during DAGG is on the order of 10 mm/min. This rapid
   growth provides a convenient means of producing large single crystals in
   the solid state. When significant normal grain growth occurs prior to
   DAGG, island grains result. DAGG was observed in sheet materials with
   two very different primary recrystallization textures. DAGG grains in Mo
   favor boundary growth along the tensile axis in a aOE (c) 110 >
   direction, preferentially producing single crystals with orientations
   from an approximately aOE (c) 110 > fiber family of orientations. A
   mechanism of boundary unpinning is proposed to explain the dependence of
   boundary migration on plastic straining during DAGG.}},

Abstract = {{Nanovectors hold substantial promise in abating the off-target effects
   of therapeutics by providing a means to selectively accumulate payloads
   at the target lesion, resulting in an increase in the therapeutic index.
   A sophisticated understanding of the factors that govern the degradation
   and release dynamics of these nanovectors is imperative to achieve these
   ambitious goals. In this work, we elucidate the relationship that exists
   between variations in pore size and the impact on the degradation,
   loading, and release of multistage nanovectors. Larger pored vectors
   displayed faster degradation and higher loading of nanoparticles, while
   exhibiting the slowest release rate. The degradation of these particles
   was characterized to occur in a multi-step progression where they
   initially decreased in size leaving the porous core isolated, while the
   pores gradually increased in size. Empirical loading and release studies
   of nanoparticles along with diffusion modeling revealed that this
   prolonged release was modulated by the penetration within the porous
   core of the vectors regulated by their pore size. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The accelerating increase in information traffic demands the expansion
   of optical access network systems that require the cost reduction of
   optical and photonic components. Low cost, ease of fabrication, and
   integration capabilities of low optical-loss polymers make them
   attractive for photonic applications. In addition to passive
   wave-guiding components, electro-optic (EO) polymers consisting of a
   polymeric matrix doped with organic nonlinear chromophores have enabled
   wide-RF-bandwidth and low-power optical modulators. Beside board level
   passive and active optical components, compact on-chip modulators (a few
   100 mu m to a few millimeters) have been made possible by hybrid
   integration of EO polymers onto the silicon platform. This paper
   summarizes some of the recent progress in polymer-based optical
   modulators and interconnects. A highly linear, broadband directional
   coupler modulator for use in analog optical links and compact, and
   low-power silicon/polymer hybrid slot photonic crystal waveguide
   modulators for on chip applications are presented. Recently,
   cost-effective roll-to-roll fabrication of electronic and photonic
   systems on flexible substrates has been gaining interest. A low-cost
   imprinted/ink-jet-printed Mach-Zehnder modulator and board-to-board
   optical interconnects using microlens integrated 45. mirror couplers
   compatible with the roll-to-roll fabrication platforms are also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new algorithm for the stochastic shortest path
   problem where path costs are a weighted sum of expected cost and cost

Abstract = {{Antibody therapeutics are one of the fastest growing classes of
   pharmaceuticals, with an annual US market over \$20 billion, developed
   to treat a variety of diseases including cancer, auto-immune and
   infectious diseases. Most are currently administered as a single

   specificity and protective mechanism, may improve clinical efficacy.
   Here, we review progress in the development of oligoclonal combinations
   of antibodies to treat disease, focusing on identification of
   synergistic antibodies. We then discuss the application of modern
   antibody engineering technologies to produce highly potent antibody
   preparations, including oligoclonal antibody cocktails and truly
   recombinant polyclonal antibodies. Specific examples illustrating the
   synergy conferred by multiple antibodies will be provided for diseases
   caused by botulinum toxin, cancer and immune thrombocytopenia. The
   bioprocessing and regulatory options for these preparations will be

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Neutron and density logs are important borehole measurements for
   estimating reservoir capacity and inferring saturating fluids. The
   neutron log, measuring the hydrogen index, is commonly expressed in
   apparent water-filled porosity units assuming a constant matrix
   lithology whereby it is not always representative of actual pore fluid.
   By contrast, a lithology-independent porosity calculation from nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR) and/ or core measurements provides reliable
   evaluations of reservoir capacity. In practice, not all wells include
   core or NMR measurements. We discovered an interpretation workflow
   wherein formation porosity and hydrocarbon constituents can be estimated
   from density and neutron logs using an interactive, variable matrix
   scale specifically suited for the precalculated matrix density. First,
   we estimated matrix components from combinations of nuclear logs
   (photoelectric factor, spontaneous gamma ray, neutron, and density)
   using Schlumberger's nuclear parameter calculator (SNUPAR) as a matrix
   compositional solver while assuming freshwater-filled formations. The
   combined effects of grain density, volumetric concentration of shale,
   matrix hydrogen, and neutron lithology units define an interactive
   matrix scale for correction of neutron porosity. Under updated matrix
   conditions, the resulting neutron-density crossover can only be
   attributed to pore volume and saturating fluid effects. Second,
   porosity, connate-water saturation, and hydrocarbon density are
   calculated from the discrepancy between corrected neutron and density
   logs using SNUPAR and Archie's water saturation equation, thereby
   eliminating the assumption of freshwater saturation. With matrix effects
   eliminated from the neutron-density overlay, gas-or light-oil-saturated
   formations exhibiting the characteristic gas neutron-density crossover
   become representative of saturating hydrocarbons. This behavior gives a
   clear qualitative distinction between hydrocarbon-saturated and
   nonviable depth zones.}},

Abstract = {{Well-log-based hydraulic rock typing is critical in deepwater reservoir
   description and modeling. Resistivity logs are often used for hydraulic
   rock typing due to their high sensitivity to rock textural attributes
   such as porosity and tortuosity. However, resistivity logs measured at
   different water saturation conditions need to be cautiously used for
   hydraulic rock typing because, by definition, the properties of
   hydraulic rock types (HRT) are independent of fluid saturation. We
   compare theoretical models of electrical and hydraulic conductivity of
   clastic rocks exhibiting different pore-size distributions and
   originating from different sedimentary grain sizes. When rocks
   exhibiting similar porosity ranges are fully saturated with
   high-salinity water, hydraulic conductivity is dominantly controlled by
   characteristic pore size while electrical conductivity is only
   marginally affected by the characteristic pore size. As a result, rock
   types with similar porosity but different characteristic pore sizes
   cannot be effectively differentiated with resistivity logs in a
   water-bearing zone. In a hydrocarbon-bearing zone at irreducible water
   saturation, capillary pressure gives rise to specific desaturation
   behaviors in different rock types during hydrocarbon migration, thereby
   causing differentiable resistivity log attributes that are suitable for
   classifying HRT. Core data and well logs acquired from a deep-drilling
   exploration well penetrating Tertiary turbidite oil reservoirs in the
   Gulf of Mexico, verify that inclusion of resistivity logs in the rock
   classification workflow can significantly improve the accuracy of
   hydraulic rock typing in zones at irreducible water saturation.
   Classification results exhibit a good agreement with those obtained from
   nuclear magnetic resonance logs, but have relatively lower vertical
   resolution. The detected and ranked HRT exhibit different grain-size
   distributions, which provide useful information for sedimentary facies
   analysis.}},

   ratio by weight, were produced by carding and needle-punching
   techniques, followed by a compression molding with 6-mm thick gauge. The
   uniaxial tensile, three-point bending, in-plane shearing, and Izod
   impact tests were performed to evaluate the composite mechanical
   properties. The thermal properties were evaluated using
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The performance of sound
   absorption and sound insulation was also investigated. An adhesive-free
   sandwich structure was found to have excellent sound absorption and
   insulation performance. Based on the evaluation of end-use performance,
   the best processing condition combination of 230 degrees C and 120 s was
   determined, and the correlation between mechanical properties and
   acoustical behavior was also verified by the panel resonance theory. (C)

Abstract = {{Investigation of Cu2S as cathode in lithium cells with ether-based
   electrolytes shows a discharge voltage plateau at 1.7 and 2.25 V in the
   first cycle which slowly evolve, respectively, to 1.74 and 1.94 V in the
   following cycles. This transition process has been analyzed by ex situ
   X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The discharged products
   are identified as Li2S and elemental copper, and the charged product is
   Cu1.96S, all of which are crystalline during cycling. SEM reveals a
   pulverization process of particles during the phase transition and the
   EIS shows a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance after
   charges. The Cu2S electrodes exhibit a relatively stable discharge
   capacity of around 250 mAh g(-1) at rates of C/10, C/5, and C/2 after a
   capacity decline in the first cycle. Coulombic efficiency starts to
   decrease in early cycles as the rate increases. The poor cyclability and
   low Coulombic efficiency at high rates like 1 C rate indicate the
   transition process is limited at high rates due to the large particle
   size. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of applied strain on the arrangement of atoms in

   and cluster expansion Hamiltonians. The strain effects are found to be
   significant, with heteronuclear (Au-Pd) interactions more strongly
   enhanced by biaxial compression than homonuclear (Pd-Pd) ones. In
   particular, compressive strain causes an increase in the population of
   Pd monomers and second nearest-neighbor pairs of Pd monomers, both of
   which have been identified previously as important ensembles for various
   catalytic reactions. We also discuss the origin of these effects using
   density functional theory calculations of the surface electronic
   structure of strained AuPd/Pd(100). Our findings may suggest an
   additional means of employing strain to tune the catalytic properties of

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of the size dependent properties of LiFePO4 have
   focused on the diffusion rate or phase transformation pathways by bulk
   analysis techniques such as x-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron diffraction
   and electrochemistry. In this work, in situ Raman spectroscopy was used
   to study the surface phase change during charge and self-discharge on a
   more localized scale for three morphologies of LiFePO4: (1) 25 +/- 6 nm
   width nanorods, (2) 25 +/- 6 nm width nanorods and (3) similar to 2 mu m
   porous microspheres. Both the large nanorod and microsphere geometries
   showed incomplete delithiation at the end of charge, which was most
   likely caused by anti-site defects along the 1D diffusion channels in
   the bulk of the larger particles. Based on the in situ Raman
   measurements, all of the morphologies studied exhibited self-discharge
   with time. Among them, the smallest FePO4 particles self-discharged
   (lithiated) the fastest. While nanostructuring LiFePO4 can offer
   advantages in terms of lowering anti-site defects within particles, it
   also creates new problems due to high surface energies that allow
   self-discharge. The in situ Raman spectroscopy also showed that carbon
   coating did not provide significant improvement to the stability of the
   lithiated particles.}},

   liners (GCLs) with particular focus on capillary barriers, liner
   performance under elevated temperatures, and interface friction
   respectively. Mechanisms involved in the development of capillary
   barriers are evaluated to explain the storage of water at the interface
   between materials with contrasting hydraulic conductivity (e.g. a
   fine-grained soil and a nonwoven geotextile). Potential desiccation of
   GCLs is explained in the light of an application in a liquid waste

Abstract = {{The miniaturization and integration of frequency-agile microwave
   circuits-relevant to electronically tunable filters, antennas,
   resonators and phase shifters-with microelectronics offers tantalizing
   device possibilities, yet requires thin films whose dielectric constant
   at gigahertz frequencies can be tuned by applying a quasi-static
   electric field(1). Appropriate systems such as BaxSr1-xTiO3 have a
   paraelectric-ferroelectric transition just below ambient temperature,
   providing high tunability(1-3). Unfortunately, such films suffer
   significant losses arising from defects. Recognizing that progress is
   stymied by dielectric loss, we start with a system with exceptionally
   low loss-Srn+1TinO3n+1 phases(4,5)-in which (SrO)(2) crystallographic
   shear(6,7) planes provide an alternative to the formation of point
   defects for accommodating non-stoichiometry(8,9). Here we report the
   experimental realization of a highly tunable ground state arising from
   the emergence of a local ferroelectric instability(10) in biaxially
   strained Srn+1TinO3n+1 phases with n >= 3 at frequencies up to 125 GHz.
   In contrast to traditional methods of modifying
   ferroelectrics-doping(1-3,11,12) or strain(13-16)-in this unique system
   an increase in the separation between the (SrO)(2) planes, which can be
   achieved by changing n, bolsters the local ferroelectric instability.
   This new control parameter, n, can be exploited to achieve a figure of
   merit at room temperature that rivals all known tunable microwave
   dielectrics(3).}},

   itinerant electrons from the Ir-O sublattice makes Kondo-like physics
   take place at a temperature as high as 80 K. Results from the local

   structure. The magnetization anomaly found at 80 K can be well
   rationalized by the two-fluid model.}},

Abstract = {{A crystal-chemical guide is provided for understanding how factors such
   as the crystal structure and covalency of the polyanion affect the
   M2+/3+ redox energies polyanion cathodes. Although there are more
   rigorous techniques available, our approach is precise in spite of being
   simple. We show that an accurate prediction can be made with regard to
   the voltages delivered based on a basic understanding of how the
   coordination of the transition-metal ion affects the covalency of the
   M-O bond. Additionally, a new method for assessing the covalency of the
   polyanion (beyond the electronegativity of the countercation) is
   presented and used to explain why the voltage delivered by Li2MP2O7
   cathodes is higher than that of LiMPO4. Furthermore, a comparison of the
   silicate and phosphate structures reveals that edge sharing between
   transition metal polyhedra and other cation polyhedra has an opposite
   effect on the voltage delivered by these materials. For instance, edge
   sharing with LiO4 polyhedra in the silicates raises the M2+/3+ redox
   energy, whereas edge sharing with PO4 polyhedra in the phosphates lowers
   the M2+/3+ redox energy. This is due to a difference in the strength of
   the repulsive force exerted on the transition metal by the P5+ cation
   when compared to Li+. This observation is significant since edge sharing
   has generally been viewed as a structural feature that lowers the redox
   energy. Lastly, crystal field splitting consideration alone is not
   sufficient to understand the voltage trends for polyanion cathodes and
   one must consider the contributions of the structure and/or the
   inductive effect. Our analysis provides new insights that may prove
   useful in tuning the voltage of existing polyanion systems and in the
   design of new cathode materials.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric microemulsions are formed in a narrow range of phase diagram
   when a blend of immiscible homopolymers is compatibilized by copolymers.
   In this study, we consider the ternary blend system of A and B
   homopolymers mixed with block copolymers containing A and B segments and
   probe the efficacy of different copolymer configurations in promoting
   the formation of microemulsion phases. Specifically, we consider (a)
   monodisperse diblock copolymers (D), (b) diblock copolymers with
   bidisperse molecular weights (MW) (BDL), (c) block copolymers having MW
   polydispersity in one of the blocks (PD), (d) diblock copolymers having
   monodisperse MW but bidispersity in average composition (BDC), and (e)
   gradient copolymers exhibiting a linear variation in the average
   composition (G). Using single chain in mean field simulations effected
   in two dimensions, we probe the onset of formation and the width of the
   bicontinuous microemulsion channel in the ternary phase diagram of
   homopolymer blended with compatibilizer. We observed that diblock
   copolymers having bidisperse composition are most efficient (i.e.,
   microemulsion phases occupy the largest area of phase diagram) in
   forming microemulsions. On the other hand, monodisperse diblock
   copolymers and diblock copolymers having bidisperse MW distribution form
   microemulsions with the least amount of compatibilizers. We rationalize
   our results by explicitly quantifying the interfacial activity and the
   influence of fluctuation effects in the respective copolymer systems.}},

Abstract = {{Size, surface charge, and material compositions are known to influence
   cell uptake of nanoparticles. However, the effect of particle geometry,
   i.e., the interplay between nanoscale shape and size, is less
   understood. Here we show that when shape is decoupled from volume,
   charge, and material composition, under typical in vitro conditions,
   mammalian epithelial and immune cells preferentially internalize
   disc-shaped, negatively charged hydrophilic nanoparticles of high aspect
   ratios compared with nanorods and lower aspect-ratio nanodiscs.
   Endothelial cells also prefer nanodiscs, however those of intermediate
   aspect ratio. Interestingly, unlike nanospheres, larger-sized hydrogel
   nanodiscs and nanorods are internalized more efficiently than their
   smallest counterparts. Kinetics, efficiency, and mechanisms of uptake
   are all shape-dependent and cell type-specific. Although
   macropinocytosis is used by both epithelial and endothelial cells,
   epithelial cells uniquely internalize these nanoparticles using the
   caveolae-mediated pathway. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, on
   the other hand, use clathrin-mediated uptake for all shapes and show
   significantly higher uptake efficiency compared with epithelial cells.
   Using results from both upright and inverted cultures, we propose that
   nanoparticle internalization is a complex manifestation of three
   shape-and size-dependent parameters: particle surface-to-cell membrane
   contact area, i.e., particle-cell adhesion, strain energy for membrane
   deformation, and sedimentation or local particle concentration at the
   cell membrane. These studies provide a fundamental understanding on how
   nanoparticle uptake in different mammalian cells is influenced by the
   nanoscale geometry and is critical for designing improved nanocarriers
   and predicting nanomaterial toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the global scattering response of invisibility cloaks over
   the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from static to very high
   frequencies. Based on linearity, causality, and energy conservation, we
   show that the total extinction and scattering, integrated over all
   wavelengths, of any linear, passive, causal, and nondiamagnetic cloak,
   necessarily increase compared to the uncloaked case. In light of this
   general principle, we provide a quantitative measure to compare the
   global performance of different cloaking techniques and we discuss
   solutions to minimize the global scattering signature of an object using
   thin, superconducting shells. Our results provide important physical
   insights on how invisibility cloaks operate and affect the global
   scattering of an object, suggesting ways to defeat countermeasures aimed
   at detecting cloaked objects using short impinging pulses.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports the gas separation performance of several 6FDA-based
   polyimides with different chemical structures, to correlate chemical
   structure with gas transport properties with a special focus on CO2 and
   CH4 transport and plasticization stability of the polyimides membranes
   relevant to natural gas purification. The consideration of the other
   gases (He, O-2 and N-2) provided additional insights regarding effects
   of backbone structure on detailed penetrant properties. The polyimides
   studied include 6FDA-DAM, 6FDA-mPDA, 6FDA-DABA, 6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2),
   6FDA-DAM:mPDA (3:2) and 6FDA-mPDA:DABA (3:2). Both pure and binary gas
   permeation were investigated. The packing density, which is tunable by
   adjusting monomer type and composition of the various samples,
   correlated with transport permeability and selectivity. The separation
   performance of the polyimides for various gas pairs were also plotted
   for comparison to the upper bound curves, and it was found that this
   family of materials shows attractive performance. The CO2 plasticization
   responses for the un-cross-linked polyimides showed good plasticization
   resistance to CO2/CH4 mixed gas with 10\% CO2; however, only the
   cross-linked polyimides showed good plasticization resistance under
   aggressive gas feed conditions (CO2/CH4 mixed gas with 50\% CO2 or pure
   CO2). For future work, asymmetric hollow fibers and carbon molecular
   sieve membranes based on the most attractive members of the family will
   be considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of the interaction of water with mineral surfaces is
   fundamental for the description of solid liquid interface reactions such
   as adsorption and desorption of solutes in natural and industrial
   systems. First-principles calculations can aid in the understanding of
   these interactions at the molecular level, allowing to formulate
   mechanistic laws of reaction. In this work, the adsorption of water
   (H2O) on forsteritic olivine (Mg2SiO4) is studied on the stoichiometric
   (100) surface using density functional theory (DFT) based electronic
   structure calculations to predict stability and reactivity of this
   surface under atmospheric and hydrothermal conditions. The structure and
   the energetics were analyzed for H2O interacting at different reactive
   surface sites comprising magnesium, silicon, and oxygen atoms showing
   that H2O can be adsorbed molecularly, dissociatively, or in some
   combination of the two. Ab initio thermodynamics was employed to extend
   the first-principles DFT calculations at 0 K in vacuum to atmospheric
   and hydrothermal conditions providing predictions of the changes in
   surface stability as a function of temperature and pressure. The type of
   interaction was analyzed through the surface energy, Bader charge
   analysis, and the projected density of state (PDOS) of the most stable
   hydroxylated surface over a wide range of temperatures. This analysis
   shows that the most stable configuration is the adsorption of two water
   molecules on two surface sites leading to the formation of a hydronium
   ion, H3O+, bridging two Mg1 atoms and elongating their bonds with the
   surrounding surface oxygen atoms and a H+ binding to a Si atom. Bader
   charge and density of states analyses indicate that upon interaction
   significant charge is lost from the surface atoms toward the water
   molecule groups, suggesting that the hydronium ion is chemisorbed at the
   Mg surface atoms resulting in reduced stability compared to the Si atom.
   Finally, the coverage effect up to two layers of water molecules (20
   H2O/nm(2)) was investigated to validate our calculations. Below 6
   H2O/nm(2), our calculations agree with previous DFT studies available at
   low coverage predicting that water dissociates at the most reactive
   sites. At higher coverage, our energetics agree with the experimental
   data from calorimetric measurements and show that at the most stable
   hydrated surface water can both dissociate and be molecularly adsorbed,
   thereby creating a hydrogen-bonding network involving the first and the
   second water layer.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) governing equations represent
   eight conservation equations for the evolution of density, momentum,
   energy and induced magnetic fields in an electrically conducting fluid,
   typically a plasma. A matrix free implicit method is developed to solve
   the conservation equations within the framework of an unstructured grid
   finite volume formulation. The analytic form of the convective flux
   Jacobian is derived on a general unstructured mesh and used in a
   Lower-Upper Symmetric Gauss Seidel (LU-SGS) technique developed as part
   of the implicit scheme. A grid coloring technique is also developed to
   create data parallelism in the algorithm. The computational efficiency
   of the matrix free method is compared with two common approaches: a
   global matrix solve technique that uses the GMRES (Generalized minimum
   residual) algorithm and an explicit method. The matrix-free method is
   observed to be overall computationally faster than the global matrix
   solve method and demonstrates excellent parallel scaling on multiple
   cores. The computational effort and memory requirements for the matrix
   free approach is comparable to the explicit approach which in turn is
   much lower than the global solve implicit approach. Both the matrix free
   and global solve implicit techniques exhibit superior steady state
   convergence compared to the explicit method. (C) 2013 Published by

   has been investigated. With a joint neutron diffraction (ND) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) Rietveld refinement method, the composition and weight
   percent variations of the layered and spinel phases in this composite
   cathode system have been obtained as a function of x and synthesis
   temperature. While no significant composition and weight percent
   variations are found with the synthesis temperature, the electrochemical
   characteristics of both the layered and spinel phases in the composites
   are significantly affected by the synthesis temperature. In contrast to
   the layered sample (x = 1), the capacity of the layered phase in the
   composites increases with decreasing synthesis temperature due to an
   increase in surface area. Conversely, the effect of synthesis
   temperature on the spinel phase is similar in both the spinel sample (x
   = 0) and the composite samples. However, the lower synthesis temperature
   increases the cation ordering in the 16d octahedral sites of the spinet
   phase, which changes the voltage profiles below 3 V due to the decrease
   in the lattice distortion during lithium ion insertion into the empty
   16c octahedral sites. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics are known to limit the
   performance of electronic devices. We study TLS using millikelvin
   microwave (6.4GHz) loss measurements of three atomic layer deposited
   (ALD) oxide films-crystalline BeO (c-BeO), amorphous Al2O3 (a-Al2O3),
   and amorphous LaAlO3 (a-LaAlO3)-and interpret them with room temperature
   characterization measurements. We find that the bulk loss tangent in the
   crystalline film is 6 times higher than in the amorphous films. In
   addition, its power saturation agrees with an amorphous distribution of
   TLS. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) impurity analysis of the
   c-BeO film showed excess surface carbon (C) impurities and a uniform
   hydrogen (H) impurity distribution, which coupled with the analysis of
   loss tangent strongly suggests H limited loss. Impurity analysis of the
   amorphous films reveals that they have excess H impurities at the
   ambient-exposed surface, and we extract the associated H-based surface
   loss tangent. We compare two a-Al2O3 films with drastically different C
   impurity concentrations and similar H impurity concentrations and
   conclude that H rather than C is the likely source of loss in the
   amorphous films and we find the loss per H concentration in a-Al2O3 to
   be K-H = 3 x 10(-24) cm(3). (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Ferroic transition metal oxides, which exhibit spontaneous elastic,
   electrical, magnetic, or toroidal order, exhibit functional properties
   that find use in ultrastable solid-state memories, sensors, and medical
   imaging technologies. To realize multifunctional behavior, where one
   order parameter can be coupled to the conjugate field of another order
   parameter, however, requires a common microscopic origin for the
   long-range order. Here, a complete theory is formulated for a novel form
   of ferroelectricity, whereby a spontaneous and switchable polarization
   emerges from the destruction of an antiferroelectric state due to
   octahedral rotations and ordered cation sublattices. A materials design
   framework is then constructed based on crystal-chemistry descriptors
   rooted in group theory, which enables the facile design of artificial
   oxides with large electric polarizations, P, simultaneous with small
   energetic switching barriers between +P and -P. The theory is validated
   with first principles density functional calculations on more than 16
   perovskite-structured oxides, illustrating it could be operative in any
   materials classes exhibiting two- or three-dimensional corner-connected
   octahedral frameworks. The principles governing materials selection of
   the ``layered{''} systems are shown to originate in the lattice dynamics
   of the A cation displacements stabilized by the pervasive BO6 rotations
   of single phase ABO(3) materials, whereby the latter distortions govern
   the optical band gaps, magnetic order, and critical transition
   temperatures. This approach provides the elusive route to the practical
   control of octahedral rotations, and hence, a wide range of functional
   properties, with an applied electric field.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have shown that the perovskite to post-perovskite
   phase transformation in CaIrO3 occurs more readily at room temperature
   when a shear stress is applied as compared to isotropic pressure. To
   understand this mechanistically, we have calculated the minimum-energy
   pathway of the phase transition with density functional theory under
   different pressure conditions with the generalized solid-state nudged
   elastic band method. Our results reveal that shear stress significantly
   lowers the barrier and stabilizes the product state while isotropic
   pressure initially raises the barrier and only reduces the barrier at
   pressures above 90 GPa. The nonmonotonic change in barrier with
   isotropic pressure is explained in terms of an increase in the
   activation volume under low pressure and a decrease under high pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The recent studies of thermal transport in suspended, supported, and
   encased graphene just began to uncover the richness of twodimensional
   phonon physics, which is relevant to the performance and reliability of
   graphene-based functional materials and devices. Among the outstanding
   questions are the exact causes of the suppressed basal-plane thermal
   conductivity measured in graphene in contact with an amorphous material,
   and the layer thickness needed for supported or embedded multilayer
   graphene (MLG) to recover the high thermal conductivity of graphite.
   Here we use sensitive in-plane thermal transport measurements of
   graphene samples on amorphous silicon dioxide to show that full recovery
   to the thermal conductivity of the natural graphite source has yet to
   occur even after the MLG thickness is increased to 34 layers,
   considerably thicker than previously thought. This seemingly surprising
   finding is explained by long intrinsic scattering mean free paths of
   phonons in graphite along both basal-plane and cross-plane directions,
   as well as partially diffuse scattering of MLG phonons by the
   MLG-amorphous support interface, which is treated by an interface
   scattering model developed for highly anisotropic materials. Based on
   the phonon transmission coefficient calculated from reported
   experimental thermal interface conductance results, phonons emerging
   from the interface consist of a large component that is scattered across
   the interface, making rational choice of the support materials a
   potential approach to increasing the thermal conductivity of supported
   MLG.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal conductivity of individual ZnTe nanowires (NWs) was measured
   using a suspended micro-bridge device with built-in resistance
   thermometers. A collection of NWs with different diameters were
   measured, and strong size-dependent thermal conductivity was observed in
   these NWs. Compared to bulk ZnTe, NWs with diameters of 280 and 107 nm
   showed approximately three and ten times reduction in thermal
   conductivity, respectively. Such a reduction can be attributed to
   phonon-surface scattering. The contact thermal resistance and the
   intrinsic thermal conductivities of the nanowires were obtained through
   a combination of experiments and molecular dynamic simulations. The
   obtained thermal conductivities agree well with theoretical predictions.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration research at Cranfield,
   Mississippi is studied by injecting millions tonnes of CO2 into the
   lower Tuscaloosa sandstone Formation over a two year period. Time-lapse
   surface seismic surveys were recorded at pre-(2007) and post-(2010)
   injection stages to monitor the subsurface fluid plume. The injection
   interval, appearing as a thin layer in the well-log data, shows very
   weak signature of CO2 injection in the time-lapse seismic amplitude
   data. In order to improve the capability of tracking CO2 plume movement
   using seismic data, we have applied a basis pursuit inversion (BPI)
   method to the post-stack seismic datasets. This method of inversion
   incorporates a priori information as a wedge dictionary and employs a
   L-1-norm optimization for obtaining solutions with improved resolution.
   The inverted time-lapse acoustic impedances show a strongly decreasing
   trend mostly at the top of the injection interval, which is in agreement
   with well-log measurements for CO2 saturation. Improved resolution
   time-lapse impedance mapping therefore is an effective tool for imaging
   the displacement of the CO2 plume. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Reservoir modeling is an important process for improving our
   understanding of processes during and after CO2 injection, and
   traditional rock and fluid characterization is the first step in
   building a static reservoir model. This model can be further refined by
   integrating dynamic data as they become available during the life of the
   project. Such data could improve the static model such that the field
   could be simulated and its future behavior predicted especially CO2
   plume size and amount of reservoir pressurization. Cranfield is an
   active CO2 flooding field with a focused research area in the water leg
   of the reservoir. One injection and two observation wells at a depth of
   >3000 m with spacing <80 m in this area are used to assess storage
   potential. Integrating various dynamic data into the initial static
   model provides a unique and challenging modeling opportunity. These data
   include well-test data, reservoir saturation tool (RST) measurements,
   pressure and temperature data both in and above the injection zone,
   U-tube samples from bottom-hole fluids, etc. Integration of all these
   data into a single numerical model helps to reduce the uncertainty of

Abstract = {{Numerous experimental and field-demonstration tests have been conducted
   to investigate the feasibility of large-scale long-term storage of CO2
   in subsurface formations and to monitor the fate of the injected gas.
   The Cranfield reservoir in western Mississippi is the location of an
   injection test and monitoring program conducted by The University of
   Texas at Austin, Bureau of Economic Geology. Geological carbon
   sequestration involves injecting CO2 into subsurface formations and
   storing it using several chemical, physical, and geological mechanisms.
   CO2 behavior in the subsurface results from the interplay of multiphase
   flow, fluid-phase behavior, relative permeability, wettability, and
   gravity. This paper presents findings of a research numerical simulator
   for modeling CO2 injection at Cranfield. Simulations focusing on a
   future postinjection period were carried out with sensitivities to
   uncertain parameters, i.e., relative permeability and its variations due
   to interfacial tension and buoyancy. Numerical results were consistent
   with bottom-hole injection flowing pressure for the first 350 days prior
   to the rate increase and also observed-CO2 breakthrough time at the
   first observation well. Results also illustrate the importance of using
   accurate trapping models to predict CO2 immobilization behavior. The
   impact of CO2/brine relative-permeability curves and trapping model on
   bottom-hole injection pressure was also demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Geologic storage of CO2 for atmospheric emissions reductions imposes
   unique requirements to document containment. Monitoring pressure in
   strata above the injection interval is a fit-to-purpose technique to
   document performance of the confining system and the degree of isolation
   provided by existing wellbore completions. The Cranfield (Mississippi,
   USA) enhanced oil recovery and sequestration project provides downhole
   high-precision pressure and temperature measurements at an observation
   well at two depths: at the injection interval and at a selected above
   zone monitoring interval (AZMI). To attempt to reconcile disparate
   observations from the pressure and temperature measurements, we present
   a simple set of coupled analytical models that enable diagnosis of
   above-zone monitoring data. Concurrent pressure and temperature
   measurements are especially valuable because they independently
   constrain the effective permeability of a leakage path along wellbore.
   Application of the models to the Cranfield data shows that the observed
   pressure elevation requires a model with an extremely large leakage rate
   and an effective wellbore permeability in order of tens of darcies. The
   temperature model shows that this rate would be large enough to raise
   the temperature in the monitoring zone significantly, which is not
   observed. We conclude that the observation well is unlikely to be
   leaking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel methodology for localizing faults in code as
   it evolves. Our insight is that the essence of failure-inducing edits
   made by the developer can be captured using mechanical program
   transformations (e. g., mutation changes). Based on the insight, we
   present the FIFL framework, which uses both the spectrum information of
   edits (obtained using the existing FAULTTRACER approach) as well as the
   potential impacts of edits (simulated by mutation changes) to achieve
   more accurate fault localization. We evaluate FIFL on real-world
   repositories of nine Java projects ranging from 5.7KLoC to 88.8KLoC. The
   experimental results show that FIFL is able to outperform the
   state-of-the-art FAULTTRACER technique for localizing failure-inducing
   program edits significantly. For example, all 19 FIFL strategies that
   use both the spectrum information and simulated impact information for
   each edit outperform the existing FAULTTRACER approach statistically at
   the significance level of 0.01. In addition, FIFL with its default
   settings outperforms FAULTTRACER by 2.33\% to 86.26\% on 16 of the 26
   studied version pairs, and is only inferior than FAULTTRACER on one
   version pair.}},

Abstract = {{The explosive growth in data traffic is resulting in a spectrum crunch
   forcing many wireless network operators to look towards refarming their
   2G spectrum and deploy more spectrally efficient Long Term Evolution
   (LTE) technology. However, mobile network operators face a challenge
   when it comes to spectrum refarming because 2G technologies such as
   Global System for Mobile (GSM) is still widely used for low bandwidth
   machineto- machine (M2M) devices. M2M devices typically have long life
   cycles, e.g. smart meters, and it is expensive to migrate these devices
   to newer technology since a truck roll will typically be required to the
   site where a device is deployed. Furthermore, with cost of 2G modules
   several times less than that of LTE, even newly deployed M2M devices
   tend to adopt 2G technology. Nevertheless, operators are keen to either
   force their 2G M2M customers to migrate so that they can refarm the
   spectrum or set aside a portion of the 2G spectrum for continuing
   operating 2G and only refarm the rest for LTE. In this paper we propose
   a novel solution to provide GSM connectivity within an LTE carrier
   through an efficient overlay by reserving a few physical resource blocks
   for GSM. With this approach, operators can refarm their 2G spectrum to
   LTE efficiently while still providing some GSM connectivity to their low
   data rate M2M customers. Furthermore, spectrum can be dynamically shared
   between LTE and GSM. An approach similar to that proposed in this paper
   can also be applied for other narrow band technology overlays over LTE.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitive and quantitative assessment of changes in circulating tumor
   cells (CM) can help in cancer prognosis and in the evaluation of
   therapeutics efficacy. However, extremely low occurrence of CTCs in the
   peripheral blood (approximately one CTC per billion blood cells) and
   potential changes in molecular biomarkers during the process of
   epithelial to mesenchymal transition create technical hurdles to the
   enrichment and enumeration of CTCs. Recently, efforts have been directed
   toward development of antibody-capture assays based on the expression of
   the common biomarker-the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) of
   epithelium-derived cancer cells. Despite some promising results, the
   assays relying on EpCAM capture have shown inconsistent sensitivity in
   clinical settings and often fail to detect CTCs in patients with
   metastatic cancer. We have addressed this problem by the development of
   an assay based on hybrid magnetic/plasmonic nanocarriers and a
   microfluidic channel. In this assay, cancer cells are specifically
   targeted by antibody-conjugated magnetic nanocarriers and are separated
   from normal blood cells by a magnetic force in a microfluidic chamber.
   Subsequently, immunofluorescence staining is used to differentiate CTCs
   from normal blood cells. We demonstrated in cell models of colon,
   breast, and skin cancers that this platform can be easily adapted to a
   variety of biomarkers, targeting both surface receptor molecules and
   intracellular biomarkers of epithelial-derived cancer cells. Experiments
   in whole blood showed capture efficiency greater than 90\% when two
   cancer biomarkers are used for cell capture. Thus, the combination of
   immunotargeted magnetic nanocarriers with microfluidics provides an
   important platform that can improve the effectiveness of current CTC
   assays by overcoming the problem of heterogeneity of tumor cells in the
   circulation.}},

Abstract = {{Bimetallic PdPt dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) having sizes
   of about 2 nm were synthesized by a homogeneous route that involved (1)
   formation of a Pd core, (2) deposition of a Cu shell onto the Pd core in

   shell. Under these conditions, a Pd@Pt core@shell DEN is anticipated,
   but detailed characterization by in-situ extended X-ray absorption fine
   structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and other analytical methods indicate
   that the metals Invert to yield a Pt-rich core with primarily Pd in the
   shell. The experimental findings correlate well with density functional
   theoretical (DFT) calculations. Theory suggests that the increased
   disorder associated with <similar to 2 nm diameter nanoparticles, along
   with the relatively large number of edge and corner sites, drives the
   structural rearrangement. This type of rearrangement is not observed on

Abstract = {{Dynamical characteristics of tip vortices shed from a 1 m diameter,
   four-bladed rotor in hover are investigated using various aperiodicity
   correction techniques. Data are acquired by way of stereo-particle image
   velocimetry and comprises measurements up to 260 degrees vortex age with
   10 degrees offsets. The nominal operating condition of the rotor
   corresponds to Re-c = 248,000 and M = 0.23 at the blade tip. With the
   collective pitch set to 7.2 degrees and a rotor solidity of 0.147, blade
   loading (C-T/sigma) is estimated from blade element momentum theory to
   be 0.042. The findings reveal a noticeable, anisotropic, aperiodic
   vortex wandering pattern over all vortex ages measured. These findings
   are in agreement with recent observations of a full-scale, four-bladed
   rotor in hover operating under realistic blade loading. The principal
   axis of wander is found to align itself perpendicular to the slipstream
   boundary. Likewise, tip vortices trailing from different blades show a
   wandering motion that is in phase instantaneously with respect to one
   another, in every direction and at every wake age in the measurement
   envelope.}},

   numbers up to delta(+) approximate to 2000}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{One-point statistics are presented for new direct simulations of the
   zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer in the range Re-theta =
   2780-6680, matching channels and pipes at delta(+) approximate to
   1000-2000. For tripped boundary layers, it is found that the
   eddy-turnover length is a better criterion than the Reynolds number for
   the recovery of the largest flow scales after an artificial inflow.
   Beyond that limit, the integral parameters, mean velocities, Reynolds
   stresses, and pressure fluctuations of the new simulations agree very
   well with the available numerical and experimental data, but show clear
   differences with internal flows when expressed in wall units at the same
   wall distance and Reynolds number. Those differences are largest in the
   outer layer, independent of the Reynolds number, and apply to the three
   velocity components. The logarithmic increase with the Reynolds number
   of the maximum of the streamwise velocity and pressure fluctuations is
   confirmed to apply to experimental and numerical internal and external
   flows. The new simulations also extend to a wider range of Reynolds
   numbers, and to more than a decade in wall distance, the evidence for
   logarithmic intensity profiles of the spanwise velocity and of the
   pressure intensities. Streamwise velocity fluctuations appear to require
   higher Reynolds numbers to develop a clear logarithmic profile, but it
   is argued that the comparison of the available near-wall data with
   fluctuation profiles experimentally obtained by other groups at higher
   Reynolds numbers can only be explained by assuming the existence of a
   mesolayer for the fluctuations. The statistics of the new simulation are
   available in our website. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A modeling procedure is presented for multiple-port,
   multiple-vibration-mode transducers. Unique features of the procedure
   include the use of modal coordinates to describe deformations of the
   mechanical structure, the use of a network analog for each vibration
   mode of the structure, and the selection of modal velocity, rather than
   a particular physical velocity on the structure, as the mechanical flow
   variable in each modal network. Finite element analysis is used only to
   compute a discrete set of salient circuit parameters, with all other
   analysis and design computations performed using the networks. The
   approach is computationally efficient and assists with providing
   insights into the design of actuators and micromechanical resonators,
   where the generation and suppression of particular vibration modes may
   be important. A micromachined, multiple-port piezoelectric microphone
   with in-plane directivity is presented as a case study to demonstrate
   application of the procedure. Model verification is performed by
   comparing simulated and measured port-to-port transfer functions over a
   frequency range spanning several vibration modes of the device. The
   modeling procedure can address multiple-port sensor response to
   distributed loadings, selective excitation and suppression of modes in
   actuator applications, and mixed sensing and actuator applications such
   as the demonstrated port-to-port measurements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Wettability modification of solid rocks with surfactants is an important
   process and has the potential to recover oil from reservoirs. When
   wettability is altered by use of surfactant solutions, capillary
   pressure, relative permeabilities, and residual oil saturations change
   wherever the porous rock is contacted by the surfactant. In this study,
   a mechanistic model is described in which wettability alteration is
   simulated by a new empirical correlation of the contact angle with
   surfactant concentration developed from experimental data. This model
   was tested against results from experimental tests in which oil was
   displaced from oil-wet cores by imbibition of surfactant solutions.
   Quantitative agreement between the simulation results of oil
   displacement and experimental data from the literature was obtained.
   Simulation of the imbibition of surfactant solution in laboratory-scale
   cores with the new model demonstrated that wettability alteration is a
   dynamic process, which plays a significant role in history matching and
   prediction of oil recovery from oil-wet porous media. In these
   simulations, the gravity force was the primary cause of the
   surfactant-solution invasion of the core that changed the rock
   wettability toward a less oil-wet state.}},

Abstract = {{This paper establishes low-tension gas (LTG) as a method for submiscible
   tertiary recovery in tight sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. The LTG
   process involves the use of surfactant and gas to mobilize and then
   displace residual crude after waterflood at a greatly reduced oil/water
   interfacial tension (IFT). This method allows extending surfactant
   enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in sub-20-md formations in which polymer is
   impractical because of plugging, shear, or the requirement to use a
   low-molecular-weight polymer.
   The proposed strategy is tested through the coinjection of nitrogen and
   a slug/drive surfactant solution. Results indicate favorable
   mobilization and displacement of residual crude oil in both
   tight-carbonate and tight-sandstone reservoirs. Tertiary recovery of
   75-90\% of residual oil in place (ROIP) was achieved for cores with 2-
   to 15-md permeability. High LTG tertiary recovery is contrasted with
   results from reference surfactant (no gas) flooding (28\% ROIP tertiary
   recovery) and immiscible gas coinjection (no surfactant) flooding (13\%
   ROIP tertiary recovery). In addition, high initial oil saturation was
   tested to determine the process tolerance to oil and to evaluate the
   potential for application during secondary recovery. Under such
   conditions, this method achieved a recovery of 84\% of oil originally in
   place (OOIP), suggesting the potential application of this process at
   secondary recovery.
   To better understand the physical mechanisms that affect mobilization
   and displacement, the early production of an elongated oil bank at
   reduced fractional flow of oil was shown to be an attribute of high
   crude-oil relative mobility and low pore volume (PV) available to mobile
   oil. This should favorably affect economics during chemical flooding by
   accelerating the production of an oil bank. Next, by application of
   salinity as a conservative tracer and oil material balance, gas
   saturation during LTG floods was calculated to be 18 to 22\%. By
   comparing effluent salinity profiles across floods, a qualitative
   understanding of in-situ fluid dispersion associated with macroscopic
   displacement stability is developed. The results indicate that in-situ
   foaming was present, which enabled mobility control, and that stable
   displacement of in-situ fluids was achieved during flooding.}},

Abstract = {{Three hydrocarbon phases can coexist at equilibrium at relatively low
   temperatures in many carbon dioxide (CO2) floods. The formation of an
   aqueous phase in contact with hydrocarbon phases is inevitable in almost
   all recovery processes, because of the permanent presence of water in
   the reservoirs either as injection fluid or as initial formation water.
   As the number of phases increases, flash calculations become more
   difficult and time-consuming. A possible approach to reduce the
   computational time of the phase-equilibrium calculations is to use
   reduced methods. This paper presents a general strategy to model the
   phase behavior of CO2/hydrocarbon/water systems in which four
   equilibrium phases occur by use of a reduced-flash approach. The speedup
   obtained by a reduced-flash algorithm compared with the
   conventional-flash approach is demonstrated for a different number of
   components and phases. The results show a significant speedup in the
   Jacobian-matrix construction and in Newton-Raphson (NR) iterations by
   use of the reduced method when four phases are present. The
   computational advantage of the reduced method increases rapidly with the
   number of phases and components. The developed four-phase reduced-flash
   algorithm is used to investigate the effect of introducing water on the
   phase behavior of two west Texas oil/CO2 mixtures. The results show
   changes in the phase splits and saturation pressures by adding water to
   these CO2/hydrocarbon systems.}},

Title = {{Discovery of a Substrate Selectivity Motif in Amino Acid Decarboxylases
   Unveils a Taurine Biosynthesis Pathway in Prokaryotes}},

Abstract = {{Taurine, the most abundant free amino acid in mammals, with many
   critical roles such as neuronal development, had so far only been
   reported to be synthetized in eukaryotes. Taurine is the major product
   of cysteine metabolism in mammals, and its biosynthetic pathway consists
   of cysteine dioxygenase and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase
   (hCSAD). Sequence, structural, and mutational analyses of the
   structurally and sequentially related hCSAD and human glutamic acid
   decarboxylase (hGAD) enzymes revealed a three residue substrate
   recognition motif (X(1)aa(19)X(2)aaX(3)), within the active site that is
   responsible for coordinating their respective preferred amino acid
   substrates. Introduction of the cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) motif into
   hGAD (hGAD-S192F/N212S/F214Y) resulted in an enzyme with a >700 fold
   switch in selectivity toward the decarboxylation of CSA over its
   preferred substrate, L-glutamic acid. Surprisingly, we found this CSA
   recognition motif in the genome sequences of several marine bacteria,
   prompting us to evaluate the catalytic properties of bacterial amino
   acid decarboxylases that were predicted by sequence motif to
   decarboxylate CSA but had been annotated as GAD enzymes. We show that
   CSAD from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7335 specifically decarboxylated CSA and
   that the bacteria accumulated intracellular taurine. The fact that CSAD
   homologues exist in certain bacteria and are frequently found in operons
   containing the recently discovered bacterial cysteine dioxygenases that
   oxidize L-cysteine to CSA supports the idea that a bona fide bacterial
   taurine biosynthetic pathway exists in prokaryotes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of optimal energy-aware content
   distribution over wireless networks with mobile-to-mobile cooperation.
   Given a number of mobile terminals (MTs) interested in downloading a
   common content via a base station (BS), the MTs are grouped into
   cooperative groups or coalitions. Within each coalition, an optimally
   chosen coalition head downloads the content from the BS and either
   unicasts or multicasts it to the other MTs. The centralized optimization
   formulations are derived for both unicasting and multicasting among the
   MTs, along with the suitable simplifications to reduce the complexity of
   the optimization formulations. Then, a polynomial time heuristic
   algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problems for relatively
   large networks where the optimal solution becomes computationally
   complex. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm, which is based on
   coalitional game theory, is developed to allow the MTs to choose,
   independently, which coalitions to join. Performance results for various
   scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithms lead to significant
   reduction in the total energy consumed by the MTs. In addition, the
   proposed centralized and distributed algorithms are shown to have
   relatively low complexity while achieving a near-optimal performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new method of simulating ductile fracture in steel

   simulation of material degradation within the framework of conventional
   nonlinear FEM. The method is validated through simulating fracture in a
   structural detail (column-to-base plate connection) for which several
   cyclic tests has been previously conducted. It is found that the method
   can successfully predict the cracking site, its propagation path, the
   number of cycles corresponding to crack initiation, and also final

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an efficient method for cancer cell capture via cell
   line-specific protein deposition on nanoporous surface in microfluidic
   channels. Specifically, anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecules (EpCAM)
   were microcontact printed onto nanoporous silica substrate with optimal
   pore size of 4 nm, porosity of 52.4 +/- 0.2\%, and thin film thickness
   of 130 +/- 0.5 nm. SkBr3, Colo205, and MDA-MB-435 cancer cells suspended
   in buffer solution were captured on the stamped nanoporous silica
   substrate. The method demonstrated significantly higher numbers of
   captured EpCAM-positive cancer cells within anti-EpCAM stamped areas.
   For site-selective cell capture, grooved microfluidic channels were
   designed to investigate effects of local confinement due to the laminar
   flows. Both theoretical modeling and experiments show that the
   integration of the microfluidic channels greatly enhances cell capture.
   Patterning of anti-EpCAM in areas of downward flow (optimal regions for
   cell capture), generated by grooves of the microchannel, enables higher
   capture numbers than that of stamped areas of upward flow (non-optimal).
   Fluorescence microscopy images were acquired for captured SkBr3 and
   Colo205 cells using anti-EpCAM on the nanoporous silica substrate. It
   was shown that higher numbers of cells were captured across all
   EpCAM-positive cell lines in optimal areas versus non-optimal areas.
   Spatial control and large scale patterning of proteins enable novel
   designs and productions of cost effective, high throughput, and
   integrated detection and analysis systems. Site-selective detection
   provides the capability of defining optimal locations for cell capture
   based on various channel geometries and flow profile. The demonstrated
   method shows great potential for point-of-care cancer diagnostic tools
   to quantify the progression and status of the disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of non-premixed turbulent combustion using large
   eddy simulation (LES) requires detailed modelling of the mixing between
   fuel and oxidizer that occurs at scales smaller than the LES
   filterwidth. The small-scale mixing process can be quantitatively
   characterized by two related variables, the subfilter scalar variance
   and the subfilter scalar dissipation rate. A recently proposed
   alternative dynamic modelling procedure for the subfilter scale
   dissipation rate, designed for use with transport equation based models
   for subfilter scalar variance, is analysed in this work. This new
   dynamic non-equilibrium modelling approach produces a nonlinear
   interaction between variance and dissipation rate predictions that makes
   it difficult to isolate the performance of any single modelling
   component in a conventional LES simulation. To gain a better
   understanding of the new model, a three-part study is undertaken here.
   The first part of the study uses a priori analysis to examine some novel
   aspects of the model's computation and guide its practical
   implementation. In the second part of the study, detailed a posteriori
   analysis of the model is performed. This analysis suggests that the
   dynamic estimate of the dissipation rate model coefficient helps to
   compensate for over-prediction of variance production rates and improves
   the accuracy of variance prediction. However, improved modelling of the
   variance production term, which in turn depends on the accuracy of
   models for the subfilter scalar flux, is necessary to allow both the
   scalar variance and dissipation rate to be predicted accurately.
   Therefore, the third part of the study examines the effect of the scalar
   flux model on the predictions of the dynamic non-equilibrium model. Use
   of a mixed model for the fluxes, rather than a gradient-diffusion-only
   model, is found to improve variance predictions in some cases.}},

Abstract = {{Syngas chemistry modelling is an integral step toward the development of
   safe and efficient syngas combustors. Although substantial effort has
   been undertaken to improve the modelling of syngas combustion, models
   nevertheless fail in regimes important to gas turbine combustors, such
   as low temperature and high pressure. In order to investigate the
   capabilities of syngas models, a Bayesian framework for the
   quantification of uncertainties has been used. This framework, given a
   set of experimental data, allows for the calibration of model
   parameters, determination of uncertainty in those parameters,
   propagation of that uncertainty into simulations, as well as
   determination of model evidence from a set of candidate syngas models.
   Here, three syngas combustion models have been calibrated using laminar
   flame speed measurements from high pressure experiments. After
   calibration the resulting uncertainty in the parameters is propagated
   forward into the simulation of laminar flame speeds. The model evidence
   is then used to compare candidate models for the given set of
   experimental conditions and results. Additionally, the technique
   MUM-PCE, an interesting uncertainty minimisation method for kinetics
   models, has been compared to the Bayesian method for this application to
   the prediction of syngas laminar flame speeds. This comparison shows the
   importance of model form error and experimental error representations in
   the uncertainty quantification context, for these choices significantly
   affect uncertainty quantification results.}},

Abstract = {{Conducting polymer hydrogels (CPHs) represent a unique class of
   materials that synergize the advantageous features of hydrogels and
   organic conductors and have been used in many applications such as
   bioelectronics and energy storage devices. This perspective provides a
   brief overview of current research activities in the field of
   three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured CPHs for high-performance
   electrochemical devices. The synthesis methods of conventional
   conductive polymers (CPs) and hydrogels are outlined with emphasis on
   newly developed methods for the preparation of 3D nanostructured CPs and
   CPHs. Following this discussion is an outline of the applications of 3D
   CPH nanostructures with particular focus on those applications in which
   nanostructured CPHs are clearly advantageous over their conventional
   counterparts. Other potential applications of nanostructured CPHs are
   also discussed in this perspective along with the main challenges and
   future research directions for this new class of conductive hydrogels.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-correlation of unknown encrypted signals between two Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers is used for spoofing
   detection of publicly-known signals. This detection technique is one of
   the strongest known defenses against sophisticated spoofing attacks if
   the defended receiver has only one antenna. The attack strategy of
   concern overlays false GNSS radio-navigation signals on top of the true
   signals. The false signals increase in power, lift the receiver tracking
   loops off of the true signals, and drag the loops and the navigation
   solution to erroneous but consistent results. Hypothesis testing theory
   is used to develop a codeless cross-correlation detection method for use
   in inexpensive, narrowband civilian GNSS receivers. The detection method
   is instantiated by using the encrypted military Global Positioning
   System (GPS) P(Y) code on the L1 frequency in order to defend the
   publicly-known civilian GPS C/A code. Successful detection of spoofing
   attacks is demonstrated by off-line processing of recorded RF data from
   narrowband 2.5 MHz RF front-ends, which attenuate the wideband P(Y) code
   by 5.5 dB. The new technique can detect attacks using correlation
   intervals of 1.2 s or less.}},

   be at a loading pH of 5.6, particle to insulin mass ratio of 7:1, a
   concentration of 1.0 mg/mL insulin, and a collapsing pH of approximately
   9.5. Microparticles exhibited a responsive (pH) or intelligent (glucose)
   release of insulin from a stimulus. Microparticles that had a nominal

   a single stimulus, compared to nearly 70\% for microparticles with a 3\%

Abstract = {{The Texas DOT (TXDOT) is concerned about the widening gap between
   pavement preservation needs and available funding. Thus, the TXDOT
   Austin district pavement engineer (DPE) has investigated methods to
   strategically allocate available pavement funding to potential projects
   that improve the overall performance of the district and Texas highway
   systems. The primary objective of the study presented in this paper is
   to develop a network-level project-screening and ranking method that
   supports the Austin district 4-year pavement-management plan
   development. The writers developed candidate-project selection and
   ranking algorithms that evaluated pavement conditions of each project
   candidate using data contained in the Pavement Management Information
   System (PMIS) database, incorporated insights from Austin district
   pavement experts, and implemented the developed method and supporting
   algorithm. This process previously required weeks to complete, but now
   requires about 10min, including data preparation and running the
   analysis algorithm, which enables the Austin DPE to devote more time and
   resources to conducting field visits, performing project-level
   evaluations, and testing candidate projects. The case study results show
   that the proposed method assisted the DPE in evaluating and prioritizing
   projects and allocating funds to the right projects at the right time.

Abstract = {{Laser speckle contrast imaging has become a widely used tool for dynamic
   imaging of blood flow, both in animal models and in the clinic.
   Typically, laser speckle contrast imaging is performed using
   scientific-grade instrumentation. However, due to recent advances in
   camera technology, these expensive components may not be necessary to
   produce accurate images. In this paper, we demonstrate that a
   consumer-grade webcam can be used to visualize changes in flow, both in
   a microfluidic flow phantom and in vivo in a mouse model. A two-camera
   setup was used to simultaneously image with a high performance
   monochrome CCD camera and the webcam for direct comparison. The webcam
   was also tested with inexpensive aspheric lenses and a laser pointer for
   a complete low-cost, compact setup (\$90, 5.6 cm length, 25 g). The CCD
   and webcam showed excellent agreement with the two-camera setup, and the
   inexpensive setup was used to image dynamic blood flow changes before
   and after a targeted cerebral occlusion. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{A harmonic rejection mixer (HRM) with a programmable local oscillator
   (LO) frequency is presented. The design allows for the generation of
   multiple effective LO frequencies within a single HRM that are derived
   from a single primary clock frequency, without any modifications to the
   analog signal path. A 16-phase HRM with the proposed frequency synthesis
   technique is implemented in a 130-nm CMOS process. A clocking approach
   within a two-stage HRM is presented, which reduces HRM sensitivity to
   both gain and phase mismatch. The HRM synthesizes eight effective LO
   frequencies and shows an 11.9-dB gain, 11.2-dB DSB NF, and +5.4-dBm
   in-band IIP3 in the fundamental mode. Greater than 72-dB HR3, 71-dB HR5,
   and 67-dB HR7 is achieved over ten IC samples in this mode without
   calibration or harmonic filtering. Harmonic rejection greater than 61 dB
   for LO factors 2-6 and 54 dB for LO factor 7 is observed, when modifying
   the effective LO frequency. The HRM achieves S11 better than -10 dB over
   50-830 MHz and has a total power consumption of 67 mW from a 1.2-V
   supply.}},

   developed for and used in, the system-level characterization and

   with specific gain-state transitions were measured within a test

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a general abstract framework for a posteriori
   estimates for immiscible incompressible two-phase flows in porous media.
   We measure the error by the dual norm of the residual and, for
   mathematical correctness, employ the concept of global and complementary
   pressures in the analysis. Our estimators allow to estimate separately
   the different error components, namely, the spatial discretization
   error, the temporal discretization error, the linearization error, the
   iterative coupling error, and the algebraic solver error. We propose an
   adaptive algorithm wherein the different iterative procedures (iterative
   linearization, iterative coupling, iterative solution of linear systems)
   are stopped when the corresponding errors do not affect significantly
   the overall error and wherein the spatial and temporal errors are
   equilibrated. Consequently, important computational savings can be
   achieved while guaranteeing a user-given precision. The developed
   framework covers fully implicit, implicit pressure-explicit saturation,
   or iterative coupling formulations; conforming spatial discretization
   schemes such as the vertex-centered finite volume method or the finite
   element method and nonconforming spatial discretization schemes such as
   the cell-centered finite volume method, the mixed finite element method,
   or the discontinuous Galerkin method; linearizations such as the Newton
   or the fixed-point one; and general linear solvers. Numerical
   experiments for a model problem are presented to illustrate the
   theoretical results. Only by stopping timely the linear and nonlinear
   solvers, speedups by a factor between 10 and 20 in terms of the number
   of total linear solver iterations are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a proposed framework for evaluating building energy
   model performance of LEED buildings through an aggregate analysis of
   comparing predicted to actual building energy consumption as well as
   evaluating how well the building energy model reflects the actual
   physical building. In this study, we seek to identify potential sources
   of energy model error by applying the framework to two, identically
   constructed and co-located, LEED-certified military dormitories. The
   simulated and actual building energy data is segregated and analyzed by
   energy type, heating/cooling season, end use, and weekday/weekend to
   determine the relative extent to which these differences contribute to
   the total annual difference between predicted and actual consumption as
   well as examine the model's assumptions regarding occupancy. Overall,
   the model over-predicted energy consumption in Buildings A and B by 14\%
   and 25\%, respectively, as based on comparison between coinciding
   modeled and actual cooling and heating seasons. The larger model errors
   appeared in over-estimating natural gas consumption, particularly the
   heating season's boiler usage. Examining the buildings' daily water
   consumption data exhibited significant changes throughout the analysis
   period, suggesting similar changes in the buildings' actual occupancy
   which deviates from the model's assumption of 100\% occupancy throughout
   the analysis period. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In geologic sequestration or in CO2-based geothermal systems, CO2 is
   present on top of the brine phase. In this study we performed a
   numerical analysis of a geothermal reservoir that is impermeable from
   the sides and is open to CO2 at the top. For this configuration, double
   diffusive natural convection due to density and temperature differences
   across the height enhance the mass transfer rate of CO2 into the
   initially stagnant brine. The analysis is done using mass, momentum,
   energy conservation laws, and the Darcy laws. The objective is to
   understand the diffusion of CO2 over long periods of time after
   sequestration into a subsurface porous media geothermal aquifer. The
   problem parameters are the solutal Rayleigh number (100 <= Ra-s <=
   10,000), the buoyancy ratio (2 <= N <= 100), the cavity aspect ratio
   (0.5 <= A <= 2), and a fixed Lewis number (Le = 301). Numerical
   computations do not exhibit natural convection effects for homogeneous
   initial conditions. Hence a sinusoidal perturbation is added for the
   initial top boundary condition. It is found that the CO2 plumes move
   faster when Ras is increased, however they slow down with decreasing N.
   For every simulation run, the average CO2 concentration ((S) over bar =
   (Sigma(ni)(i) Sigma(nJ)(j) c(i,j)/n(i) x n(j))) is computed. Higher
   concentration rates in laterally wide reservoirs make better candidates
   than deeper aquifers for CO2 sequestration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   count times. Ar-41, K-42, K-43, and Ca-47 were detected in the spectra.
   The induced activities of Ar-37, Ar-39, Ar-41, K-42, K-43, and Ca-47
   were calculated using a 63-group energy-dependent neutron flux
   determined utilizing a neutron energy flux profile calculated from a

Title = {{Effects of Bicycle Boxes on Bicyclist and Motorist Behavior at
   Intersections in Austin, Texas}},

Abstract = {{Provision of bicycle facilities at intersections is often inadequate and
   can lead to unsafe interactions between motorists and bicyclists. The
   bicycle box is a tool intended to improve the predictability of
   bicyclist stopping position at an intersection by allowing bicyclists
   utilizing a bicycle lane to position themselves in front of motorists
   during a red phase. The bicycle box in this application is meant to
   reduce the possibility of a right-hook collision, where a right-turning
   motorist collides with a through-moving bicyclist departing the
   intersection. The primary goal of this study was to determine what
   effect, if any, bicycle boxes have on bicyclist and motorist behavior.
   In 2009, 950 bicyclists were observed at two sites in three phases:
   existing conditions, after bicycle box markings were installed, and
   after a green colored pavement marking was added to the bicycle box and
   approaching bicycle lane. The predictability of bicyclists' behavior
   improved based on the increased percentage of bicyclists who used the
   bicycle lane to approach the intersection, departed the intersection
   before motorists, and stopped in front of the motor vehicle queue. While
   only 20-26\% of bicyclists stopped in the bicycle box area after
   installation of the bicycle box markings, over 90\% of bicyclists
   stopped in front of motorists and were therefore more visible to
   motorists. The addition of the green pavement markings led to
   significant improvements in bicyclist behavior, but at a considerably
   higher material cost. Motorist encroachment on the bicycle box was
   common at both sites as well as illegal right turns on red at one site.
   No bicycle-motorist collisions were observed during any stage of the
   study.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{745-757}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The bioengineering of autologous vascular networks is of great
   importance in wound healing. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are of
   interest due to their ability to differentiate toward various cell
   types, including vascular. We hypothesized that adult human ASCs
   embedded in a three-dimensional PEG-fibrin (FPEG) gel have the ability
   to modulate vascularization of a healing wound. Initial in vitro
   characterization of ASCs isolated from discarded burn skin samples
   (dsASCs) and embedded in FPEG gels indicated they could express such
   pericyte/smooth muscle cell markers as alpha-smooth muscle actin,
   platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, NG2 proteoglycan, and
   angiopoietin-1, suggesting that these cells could potentially be
   involved in a supportive cell role (i.e., pericyte/mural cell) for blood
   vessels. Using a rat skin excision model, wounds treated with
   dsASCs-FPEG gels showed earlier collagen deposition and wound remodeling
   compared to vehicle FPEG treated wounds. Furthermore, the dsASCs-seeded
   gels increased the number of vessels in the wound per square millimeter
   by day 16 (similar to 66.7 vs. similar to 36.9/mm(2)) in these same
   studies. dsASCs may support this increase in vascularization through
   their trophic contribution of vascular endothelial growth factor, as
   determined by in vitro analysis of mRNA and the protein levels.
   Immunohistochemistry showed that dsASCs were localized to the
   surrounding regions of large blood-perfused vessels. Human dsASCs may
   play a supportive role in the formation of vascular structures in the
   healing wound through direct mechanisms as well as indirect trophic
   effects. The merging of autologous grafts or bioengineered composites
   with the host's vasculature is critical, and the use of autologous
   dsASCs in these procedures may prove to be therapeutic.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{The topic of this paper will be addressed in three stages: I will first
   review currently prominent theoretical conceptualizations of the
   neurobiology of consciousness and, where appropriate, identify
   ill-advised and flawed notions in theoretical neuroscience that may
   impede viewing consciousness as a phenomenon in the physics of brain. In
   this context, I will also introduce relevant facts that tend not to
   receive adequate attention in much of the current consciousness
   discourse. Next, I will review the evidence that accrued in the last
   decade that identifies the resting brain as being in a state of
   criticality. In the framework of state phase dynamics of statistical
   physics, this observational evidence also entails that the resting brain
   is poised at the brink of a second order phase transition. On this
   basis, I will in the third stage propose applying the framework of the
   Renormalization Group to viewing consciousness as a phenomenon in
   statistical physics. In physics, concepts of phase space transitions and
   the Renormalization Group are powerful tools for interpreting phenomena
   involving many scales of length and time in complex systems. The
   significance of these concepts lies in their accounting for the
   emergence of different levels of new collective behaviors in complex
   systems, each level with its distinct macroscopic physics, organization,
   and laws, as a new pattern of reality. In this framework, I propose to
   view subjectivity as the symbolic description of the physical brain
   state of consciousness that emerges as one of the levels of phase
   transitions of the brain-body-environment system, along the trajectory
   of Renormalization Group Transformations. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new four-pole connector system (DF-4) for transvenous high-voltage
   implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) is currently available in
   clinical practice. However, no clinical data demonstrating the safety
   and effectiveness of this complex electromechanical design is available.
   This study aims to test the safety and effectiveness of this newly
   designed system compared to the conventional DF-1 leads.
   During a 3-year period, 351 consecutive patients were implanted with
   DF-4 leads as part of an ICD or ICD-cardiac resynchronization therapy
   system. Patients were matched for age, sex, and follow-up with 154
   patients implanted with a standard DF-1 lead. The primary outcome of the
   study was defibrillation lead failure, defined as the need for lead
   removal or capping. Operative, electrical, and safety data were obtained
   at implant and during postoperative follow-up.
   Implantation success rate in both groups was 100 \%. A trend towards
   shorter procedure time was observed in the DF-4 group but the difference
   did not reach statistical significance. Handling characteristics of the
   DF-4 leads were graded better than those of DF-1 models. During a total
   follow-up of 8,130.5 lead-months, there were nine ICD-lead failures
   (four system erosion/infections and five electrical lead dysfunctions).
   The overall incidence of electrical lead failure was 0.64 vs. 0.97 per
   100 lead-years, for DF-4 and DF-1 leads, respectively (P = 0.2).
   This multi-center experience provides strong evidence that the
   feasibility and safety of this novel technology compare favorably with
   those of the conventional DF-1 leads.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{As phase-averaged spectral wave models continue to grow in
   sophistication, they are applied more frequently throughout the ocean,
   from the generation of waves in deep water to their dissipation in the
   nearshore. Mesh spacings are varied within the computational domain,
   either through the use of nested, structured meshes or a single,
   unstructured mesh. This approach is economical, but it can cause
   accuracy errors in regions where the input parameters are
   under-resolved. For instance, in regions with a coarse representation of
   bathymetry, refraction can focus excessive wave energy at a single mesh
   vertex, causing the computed solution to become non-physical. Limiters
   based on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) criteria are proposed for the
   spectral propagation (refraction and frequency shifting) velocities in
   SWAN. These limiters are not required for model stability, but they
   improve accuracy by reducing local errors that would otherwise spread
   throughout the computational domain. As demonstrated on test cases in
   deep and shallow water, these limiters prevent the excessive directional
   turning and frequency shifting of wave energy and control the largest
   errors in under-resolved regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We introduce a new model for personal recognition based on the 3-D
   geometry of the face. The model is designed for application scenarios
   where the acquisition conditions constrain the facial position. The 3-D
   structure of a facial surface is compactly represented by sets of
   contours (facial contours) extracted around automatically pinpointed
   nose tip and inner eye corners. The metric used to decide whether a
   point on the face belongs to a facial contour is its geodesic distance
   from a given landmark. Iso-geodesic contours are inherently robust to
   head pose variations, including in-depth rotations of the face. Since
   these contours are extracted from rigid parts of the face, the resulting
   recognition algorithms are insensitive to changes in facial expressions.
   The facial contours are encoded using innovative pose invariant
   features, including Procrustean distances defined on pose-invariant
   curves. The extracted features are combined in a hierarchical manner to
   create three parallel face recognizers. Inspired by the effectiveness of
   region ensembles approaches, the three recognizers constructed around
   the nose tip and inner corners of the eyes are fused both at the
   feature-level and the match score-level to create a unified face
   recognition algorithm with boosted performance. The performances of the
   proposed algorithms are evaluated and compared with other algorithms
   from the literature on a large public database appropriate for the
   assumed constrained application scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Li3V2(PO4)(3)/reduced graphene oxide (designated as Li3V2(PO4)(3)/rGO)
   and Li3V2(PO4)(3)/reduced modified graphene oxide (designated as
   Li3V2(PO4)(3)/rmGO) nanocomposites have been synthesized by a
   solvothermal method, followed by post-heat treatment at 800 degrees C,
   and explored as cathodes in lithium-ion cells. Lamellar GO sheets were
   modified with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to form mGO with
   good dispersibility. The Li3V2(PO4)(3)/rGO (similar to 350 nm particles)
   and Li3V2(PO4)(3)/rmGO (similar to 200 nm particles) nanocomposite
   cathodes display discharge capacities of, respectively, 170 and 186 mA h
   g(-1) at 0.1 C rate and 118 and 135 mA h g(-1) at 10 C rate between 3.0
   and 4.8 V. The higher discharge capacity and rate capability of
   Li3V2(PO4)(3)/rmGO compared to Li3V2(PO4)(3)/rGO are ascribed mainly to
   the smaller particle size of Li3V2(PO4)(3) and the tight contact between
   the Li3V2(PO4)(3) nanoparticles and the rmGO sheets. The tight contact
   enables fast electron transport through the underlying rmGO sheets to
   Li3V2(PO4)(3) nanoparticles. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries suffer from severe capacity
   fade and self-discharge attributed to sulfur dissolution and polysulfide
   diffusion. Here we present a porous cathode architecture which
   suppresses the loss of active material and self-discharge behavior in
   Li-S systems. 3D sulfur-nickel foam cathodes (SNF cathodes) have porous,
   electrically conductive Ni foam substrates as bifunctional current
   collectors. It was found that these cathodes have a stable cycle life
   with a high discharge capacity retention rate of 92\% after 50 cycles.
   Moreover, the SNF cathodes reduce the self-discharge and retain 85\% of
   their original capacities after resting for two months. The porous
   architecture of Ni foam accommodates the active material and traps
   polysulfides in the cathode region during cycling and battery storage,
   effectively reducing the loss of active material and capacity. In
   addition, it provides an excellent internal electron transport network
   by ensuring intimate contact between the active material and Ni foam,
   resulting in low internal impedance and improved capacities. The study
   demonstrates that the 3D Ni foam is an attractive bifunctional current
   collector for Li-S batteries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Pd-Au bimetallic catalysts have shown promising performance in numerous
   reactions that involve hydrogen. Fundamental studies of hydrogen
   interactions with Pd-Au surfaces could provide useful insights into the
   reaction mechanisms over Pd-Au catalysts, which may, in turn, guide
   future catalyst design. In this study, the interactions of hydrogen
   (i.e., adsorption, absorption, diffusion, and desorption) with
   Pd/Au(111) model surfaces were studied using temperature-programmed
   desorption (TPD) under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Our experimental
   results reveal Pd-Au bimetallic surfaces readily dissociate H-2 and yet
   also weakly bind H adatoms, properties that could be beneficial for
   catalytic reactions involving hydrogen. The presence of contiguous Pd
   sites, characterized by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy
   using CO as a probe molecule (CO-RAIRS), was found to be vital for the
   dissociative adsorption of H-2 at 77 K. The H adatom binds to Pd-Au
   alloy sites more strongly than to Au(111) but more weakly than to
   Pd(111) as indicated by its desorption temperature (similar to 200 K).
   With hydrogen exposure at slightly higher temperatures (i.e., 100-150
   K), extension of a low-temperature desorption feature was observed,
   suggesting the formation of subsurface H atoms (or H absorption).
   Experiments using deuterium indicate that H-D exchange over the Pd-Au
   bimetallic surface obeys Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics and that H/D
   adatoms are mobile on the surface at low temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{The power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices made with
   ink-deposited Cu(INxGa1-x)Se-2 (CIGS) nanocrystal layers can be enhanced
   by sintering the nanocrystals with a high temperature selenization
   process. This process, however, can be challenging to control. Here, we
   report that ink deposition followed by annealing under inert gas and
   then selenization can provide better control over CIGS nanocrystal
   sintering and yield generally improved device efficiency. Annealing
   under argon at 525 degrees C removes organic ligands and diffuses sodium
   from the underlying soda lime glass into the Mo back contact to improve
   the rate and quality of nanocrystal sintering during selenization at 500
   degrees C. Shorter selenization time alleviates excessive MoSe2
   formation at the Mo back contact that leads to film delamination, which
   in turn enables multiple cycles of nanocrystal deposition and
   selenization to create thicker, more uniform absorber films. Devices
   with power conversion efficiency greater than 7\% are fabricated using
   the multiple step nanocrystal deposition and sintering process.}},

Abstract = {{A technique enabling the detection and quantification of low density
   sites on planar SiO2, surfaces is demonstrated. Fluorescent probes are
   used to titrate free hydroxyl and strained siloxane sites on the surface
   of amorphous SiO2 substrates in vacuum. The titration of free hydroxyl
   sites was performed to validate the method and to provide a reference
   for the measurement of the strained siloxane site density. Perylene
   derivatives with different functional groups are chemisorbed onto the
   surface sites, enabling in situ photoluminescence (PL) measurements of
   the bound fluorophores. An amine functional group is used to selectively
   titrate strained siloxane sites, while an alcohol group is used for the
   titration of free hydroxyl sites. Emission intensity was found to be
   nonlinear with coverage for bound fluorophore densities greater than 0.1
   nm(-2), necessitating. the removal of molecules from the surface into a
   solution to obtain accurate density measurements. For lower densities,
   the coverage of bound fluorophores can be estimated directly from in
   situ PL measurements. The measured areal densities of bound fluorophores
   after titrating free hydroxyl sites are in good agreement with
   literature values for the densities of such sites on high surface area
   silica. PL measurements of SiO2, surfaces titrated with an amine
   derivative of perylene indicate that strained siloxane sites exist for
   vacuum pretreatment temperatures of 300 C and increase with increasing
   pretreatment temperature. Densities of strained siloxane sites on the
   silica surface are estimated at 0.004-0.02 nm(-2) for pretreatment
   temperatures of 300-700 degrees C, demonstrating the sensitivity of this
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{A homogenization model is applied to describe the wave interaction with
   finite three-dimensional metamaterial objects composed of periodic
   arrays of magnetodielectric spheres and is validated with full-wave
   numerical simulations. The homogenization is based on a dipolar model of
   the inclusions, which is shown to hold even in the case of densely
   packed arrays once weak forms of spatial dispersion and the full dynamic
   array coupling are taken into account. The numerical simulations are
   based on a fast surface-integral equation solver that enables the
   analysis of scattering from complex piecewise homogeneous objects. We
   validate the homogenization model by considering electrically large
   disk- and cube-shaped arrays and quantify the accuracy of the transition
   from an array of spheres to a homogeneous object as a function of the
   array size. Simulation results show that the fields scattered from large
   arrays with up to one thousand spheres and equivalent homogeneous
   objects agree well, not only far away from the arrays but also near
   them. (c) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Near-field enhanced bifunctional plasmonic-magnetic (PM) nanostructures
   consisting of silica nanotubes with embedded solid nanomagnets and
   uniformly dual-surface-coated plasmonic Ag nanoparticles (NPs) are
   rationally synthesized. The solid embedded sections of nanotubes provide
   single-molecule sensitivity with an enhancement factor up to 7.2 x 10(9)
   for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). More than 2x SERS
   enhancement is observed from the hollow section compared to the solid
   section of the same nanotube. The substantial SERS enhancement on the
   hollow section is attributed to the dual-sided coating of Ag NPs as well
   as the near-field optical coupling of Ag NPs across the nanotube walls.
   Experimentation and modeling are carried out to understand the
   dependence of SERS enhancement on the NP sizes, junctions, and the near
   field effects. By tuning the aspect ratio of the embedded nanomagnets,
   the magnetic anisotropy of nanotubes can be readily controlled to be
   parallel or vertical to the long directions for nano-manipulation.
   Leveraging the bifunctionality, a nanotube is magnetically maneuvered to
   a single living mammalian cell amidst many and its membrane composition
   is analyzed via SERS spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Both nanocolumnar and dense germanium thin films, synthesized by
   evaporative deposition, were tested as a potential anode material for
   sodium-ion batteries. The reversible capacity of the nanocolumnar films
   was found to be 430 mAh/g, which is higher than the theoretical capacity
   of 369 mAh/g. The nanocolumnar films retained 88\% of their initial
   capacity after 100 cycles at C/5, whereas the dense films began to
   deteriorate after similar to 15 cycles. Additionally, the nanocolumnar
   films were stable at charge/discharge rates up to 27C (10 A/g). The
   diffusion coefficient for sodium in germanium was estimated, from
   impedance analysis of the dense films, to be 13 CM 2 s(-1). Modeling of
   diffusion in the sodium- germanium system predicts that sodium diffusion
   in the near-surface layers of the material is significantly faster than
   in the bulk. These results show that small feature sizes are critical
   for rapid, reversible electrochemical sodiation of germanium.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Since available data are not univocal, the aim of this study
   was to explore the existence of a seasonal variation in platelet count.
   Methods: The study was based on the database of the Italian Association
   of Blood Volunteers (AVIS), section of Ferrara, Italy, 2001-2010.
   Hematological data (170,238 exams referring to 16,422 donors) were
   categorized into seasonal and monthly intervals, and conventional and
   chronobiological analyses were applied.
   Results: Platelets and plateletcrit were significantly higher in
   winter-autumn, with a main peak in December-February (average +3.4\% and
   +4.6\%, respectively, P < 0.001 for both).
   Conclusions: Although seasonal variations have been reported for several
   acute cardiovascular diseases, it is extremely unlikely that such a
   slight increase in platelet count in winter alone may be considered as a
   risk factor.}},

   the structures, gratings with interleaved subwavelength structures were
   designed and fabricated. Two typical types of interleaving geometries
   have been investigated. Both demonstrated a 1 dB bandwidth similar to 70
   nm, a 3 dB bandwidth similar to 117 nm, and a peak efficiency similar
   to-5.1 dB at 1570 nm for transverse-electric polarized light. The
   simulation confirms that the dispersion engineering adds an extra 12 nm
   to the 1 dB bandwidth. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{A high-rate germanium-particle slurry cast Li-ion anode with high

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{238}},
Pages = {{123-136}},

Abstract = {{We report stable, high capacity cycling performance over 2500 deep
   cycles at variable C-rates (1C, 5C and 10C) for slurry-cast Li-ion
   battery anodes made using commercially-available germanium nanopowder.
   The determining factor in cycling performance was the use of
   fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) rather than ethylene carbonate (EC) as a
   co-solvent in the electrolyte. Cycling tests for the FEC-based electrode
   showed stable performance close to 700 mAh g(-1) through 500 cycles at
   10C with near 100\% Coulombic efficiency. These results show that a
   Ge-based slurry-cast electrode using active material structured only as
   a simple particle can be used to create an electrode system which is a
   candidate for optimization and scale-up. These cycling improvements
   obtained using the FEC-based electrolyte complements recent progress in
   Ge-based electrode research which has focused on improving performance
   through tailored structural and chemical modifications to the active
   material structure. The effect of the electrolyte on Li-ion transport,
   electrode stability toward oxidation, and electrode and SEI structural
   stability was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
   differential capacity profiles, SEM and cross-sectional TEM imaging
   where we characterize the evolution of the electrode structure cycled
   with the FEC-based electrolyte considering the type and extent of SEI
   growth, particle agglomeration and fracturing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A system of Fredholm second kind integral equations (SKIEs) is
   constructed for the modified biharmonic equation in two dimensions with
   gradient boundary conditions. Such boundary value problem arises
   naturally when the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved via
   a semi-implicit discretization scheme and the resulting boundary value
   problem at each time step is then solved using the pure stream-function
   formulation. The advantages of such an approach (Greengard and
   Kropinski, 1998) {[}14] are two fold: first, the velocity is
   automatically divergence free, and second, complicated (nonlocal)
   boundary conditions for the vorticity are avoided. Our construction,
   though similar to that of Farkas (1989) {[}10] for the biharmonic
   equation, is modified such that the SKIE formulation has low condition
   numbers for large values of the parameter. We illustrate the performance
   of our numerical scheme with several numerical examples. Finally, the
   scheme can be easily coupled with standard fast algorithms such as FFT,
   fast multipole methods (Greengard and Rokhlin, 1987) {[}15], or fast
   direct solvers (Ho and Greengard, 2012; Martinsson and Rokhlin, 2005)
   {[}17,25] to achieve optimal complexity, bringing accurate large-scale
   long-time fluid simulations within practical reach. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Lithiation Behavior of Silicon-Rich Oxide (SiO1/3): A First-Principles
   Study}},

Abstract = {{Silicon suboxides (SiOx, x < 2) have been recognized as a promising
   anode material for high-performance Li-ion batteries (LIBs), especially
   when the O content is relatively low. To better understand the
   lithiation behavior in partially oxidized silicon at the atomistic
   level, we perform density functional theory calculations to examine the
   structural evolution, bonding mechanism, mechanical property, and
   voltage profile of lithiated alpha-SiO1/3. With lithiation, the
   alpha-SiO1/3 host matrix gradually disintegrates as Li atoms are
   accommodated by both Si and O atoms. Interestingly, we find that the
   Si-Li coordination number (CN) monotonically increases up to CNSi-Li
   approximate to 10 in alpha-Li4SiO1/3, whereas CNO-Li tends to saturate
   far before full lithiation at CNO-Li approximate to 6; the formation
   mechanism of such intriguing Li6O complexes with O-h symmetry is
   investigated via detailed electronic structure analyses. Li
   incorporation in the alpha-SiO1/3 matrix is predicted to be highly
   favorable with a capacity comparable to that of fully lithiated Si
   (Li:Si ratio approximate to 4); additionally, the approximated
   lithiation voltage between 0.2 and 0.8 V is also well within the
   desirable range for LIB anode applications. Our study highlights the
   importance of controlling the Si:O ratio as well as O spatial
   distribution in order to tailor the desired lithiation properties; such
   a realization may benefit the rational design and development of
   high-performance silicon suboxide based anodes via fine-tuning of the
   oxidation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Enforcing essential boundary conditions plays a central role in immersed
   boundary methods. Nitsche's idea has proven to be a reliable concept to
   satisfy weakly boundary and interface constraints. We formulate an
   extension of Nitsche's method for elasticity problems in the framework
   of higher order and higher continuity approximation schemes such as the
   B-spline and non-uniform rational basis spline version of the finite
   cell method or isogeometric analysis on trimmed geometries. Furthermore,
   we illustrate a significant improvement of the flexibility and
   applicability of this extension in the modeling process of complex 3D
   geometries. With several benchmark problems, we demonstrate the overall
   good convergence behavior of the proposed method and its good accuracy.
   We provide extensive studies on the stability of the method, its

   the numerical integration concept that in many cases reduces the

Abstract = {{Carbonate rocks (calcite and dolomite) account for more than half of the
   world's hydrocarbon reserves. Despite the complexity posed by these
   rocks, it is important to understand the fundamental forces of adhesion
   responsible for the spreading and distribution of reservoir fluids, such
   as crude oil/brine on the reservoir rock surface. These physico-chemical
   interactions determine the surface energetics of a reservoir and affect
   their wetting characteristics. Inverse gas chromatography is introduced
   to characterize the surface energy of carbonates (calcite and dolomite).
   The behavior of the polar and non-polar interaction forces was
   investigated at varying water coverage and at different temperatures.
   The results indicated that in general as the water coverage increased,
   the Lifshitz-van der Waals component of surface energy decreased to
   nearly that of the bulk water, while the acid base component also showed
   a decreasing trend. The Lifshitz van der Waals component of surface
   energy always decreased with increase in temperature, while the acid
   base properties showed contrasting trends for the two minerals. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Despite its excellent physical and mechanical properties, polymer
   concrete has not been widely used owing to its much higher unit price
   than conventional portland cement concrete. To ensure the economic
   efficiency of polymer concrete, it is utmost important to reduce the use
   of polymer binder, which occupies most of the production cost of polymer
   concrete. Based on the experimental investigations, replacing filler
   (calcium carbonate) and fine aggregate (river sand) with fly ash and
   rapid-cooled steel slag (RCSS), which are spherical materials obtainable
   from industrial by-products, was found to be effective for improving the
   strength characteristics and durability as well as the cost efficiency
   of polymer concrete. The product developed in this study successfully
   reduced the demand for polymer binder by 21.3\% compared to the
   conventional product, which in turn saved the total material costs by
   18.5\%. Although the use of RCSS showed performance degradation at an
   elevated temperature condition, considering typical temperature ranges
   that actual concrete infrastructures experience, it is expected that the
   polymer concrete using fly ash and RCSS will provide high-level
   performances as construction and repair materials. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{In healthcare-related studies, individual patient or hospital data are
   not often publicly available due to privacy restrictions, legal issues,
   or reporting norms. However, such measures may be provided at a higher
   or more aggregated level, such as state-level, county-level summaries or
   averages over health zones, such as hospital referral regions (HRR) or
   hospital service areas (HSA). Such levels constitute partitions over the
   underlying individual level data, which may not match the groupings that
   would have been obtained if one clustered the data based on
   individual-level attributes. Moreover, treating aggregated values as
   representatives for the individuals can result in the ecological
   fallacy. How can one run data mining procedures on such data where
   different variables are available at different levels of aggregation or
   granularity? In this article, we seek a better utilization of variably
   aggregated datasets, which are possibly assembled from different
   sources. We propose a novel cross-level imputation technique that models
   the generative process of such datasets using a Bayesian directed
   graphical model. The imputation is based on the underlying data
   distribution and is shown to be unbiased. This imputation can be further
   utilized in a subsequent predictive modeling, yielding improved
   accuracies. The experimental results using a simulated dataset and the
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset are provided
   to illustrate the generality and capabilities of the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{Development of the AMOEBA (atomic multipole optimized energetics for
   biomolecular simulation) force field for proteins is presented. The
   current version (AMOEBA-2013) utilizes permanent electrostatic multipole
   moments through the quadrupole at each atom, and explicitly treats
   polarization effects in various chemical and physical environments. The
   atomic multipole electrostatic parameters for each amino acid residue
   type are derived from high-level gas phase quantum mechanical
   calculations via a consistent and extensible protocol. Molecular
   polarizability is modeled via a Thole-style damped interactive induction
   model based upon distributed atomic polarizabilities. Inter- and
   intramolecular polarization is treated in a consistent fashion via the
   Thole model. The intramolecular polarization model ensures
   transferability of electrostatic parameters among different
   conformations, as demonstrated by the agreement between QM and AMOEBA
   electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments of dipeptides. The backbone
   and side chain torsional parameters were determined by comparing to
   gas-phase QM (RI-TRIM MP2/CBS) conformational energies of dipeptides and
   to statistical distributions from the Protein Data Bank. Molecular
   dynamics simulations are reported for short peptides in explicit water
   to examine their conformational properties in solution. Overall the
   calculated conformational free energies and J-coupling constants are
   consistent with PDB statistics and experimental NMR results,
   respectively. In addition, the experimental crystal structures of a
   number of proteins are well maintained during molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulation. While further calculations are necessary to fully validate
   the force field, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable
   multipole force field is able to describe the structure and energetics
   of peptides and proteins, in both gas-phase and solution environments.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the widespread interest in graphene electronics over the past
   decade, high-performance graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) on
   flexible substrates have been rarely achieved, even though this atomic
   sheet is widely understood to have greater prospects for flexible
   electronic systems. In this article, we report detailed studies on the
   electrical and mechanical properties of vapor synthesized high-quality
   monolayer graphene integrated onto flexible polyimide substrates.
   Flexible graphene transistors with high-k dielectric afforded intrinsic
   gain, maximum carrier mobilities of 3900 cm(2)/V.s, and importantly, 25
   GHz cutoff frequency, which is more than a factor of 2.5 times higher
   than prior results. Mechanical studies reveal robust transistor
   performance under repeated bending, down to 0.7 mm bending radius, whose
   tensile strain is a factor of 2-5 times higher than in prior studies. In
   addition, integration of functional coatings such as highly hydrophobic
   fluoropolymers combined with the self-passivation properties of the
   polyimide substrate provides water-resistant protection without
   compromising flexibility, which is an important advancement for the
   realization of future robust flexible systems based on graphene.}},

Abstract = {{In situ heating experiments were performed in a transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) to monitor the thermal stability of silver
   nanoparticles. The sublimation kinetics from isothermal experiments on
   individual nanoparticles was used to assess the actual temperatures of
   the nanoparticles by considering the localized heating from the electron
   beam. For isolated nanoparticles, beam heating under normal TEM
   operating conditions was found to increase the temperature by tens of
   degrees. For nominally isothermal experiments, the observed sublimation
   temperatures generally decreased with decreasing particle size, in
   agreement with the predictions from the Kelvin equation. However,
   sublimation of smaller nanoparticles was often observed to occur in
   discrete steps, which led to faceting of the nanoparticles. This
   discrete behavior differs from that predicted by conventional theory as
   well as from experimental observations in larger nanoparticles where
   sublimation was continuous. A hypothesis that explains the mechanism for
   this size-dependent behavior is proposed.}},

Title = {{Mosaic-like Monolayer of Graphene Oxide Sheets Decorated with

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We report the fabrication of mosaic-like monolayers of graphene oxide
   (G-O) coated with tetrabutylammonium ions (TBA) using a simple
   spin-coating method. The TBA-coated G-O (TG-O) sheets were prepared by
   ``spontaneous exfoliation{''} of graphite oxide intercalated with
   tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) in the wet state, without the need
   for sonication. Mosaic-like monolayers could be formed on a variety of
   substrates such as Si wafer (coated with the thin native oxide), SiO2/Si
   wafer, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition and then transferred
   on SiO2/Si wafer, Au film on Si wafer, and Cu foil. The mosaic-like
   monolayer of TG-O was compared with monolayers of G-O and TG-O prepared
   using a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) trough. The formation of the mosaic-like
   TG-O monolayer films was attributed to (1) weakening of the
   electrostatic repulsion between G-O sheets by TBA, and (2) prevention of
   the overlap and stacking of TG-O sheets by disruption of the hydrogen
   bonding between the basal plane of one sheet and the basal plane or edge
   of another, by adsorbed TBA. External reflection FTIR spectroscopy
   showed that spectral features of the mosaic-like monolayer of TG-O made
   by simple spin-coating were the same as those for the monolayer
   fabricated using the LB assembly, indicating the same spatial
   orientations of functional groups. This study provides a very simple
   route to a complete monolayer of G-O without the need for an LB trough.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling is associated with a
   number of diseases, including neurological conditions and cancer.
   Enantiomers of the lignan zuonin A, (-)-zuonin A and (+)-zuonin A bind
   isoforms of JNK with similar affinity and disrupt protein-protein
   interactions at JNK's D-recruitment site. Thus, they are of interest as
   lead non-ATP competitive inhibitors of the JNKs. While (-)-zuonin A
   inhibits the activity of JNK toward c-Jun by 80\% when saturating,
   (+)-zuonin A only inhibits by 15\%. Molecular docking and molecular
   dynamics simulations were performed to gain a better understanding of
   how these inhibitors interact with JNK. The results of this study
   provide new insight into potential binding modes for (-)-zuonin A and
   suggest that (-)-zuonin A interacts with JNK via an induced fit
   mechanism near the highly conserved phi(A)-X-phi(B) recognition site.
   Binding of (+)-zuonin A to JNK displays no such dynamic feature. The
   different binding modes may help explain differences in the inhibitory
   properties of the enantiomers although further experimental work would
   be necessary to fully confirm this interpretation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and
   induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have promise in regenerative
   medicine for a variety of applications. Their potential in the treatment
   of cardiovascular disease is of particular interest due to its severity
   and prevalence. In order to be successful for cell therapy, PSCs must be
   pre-differentiated into cardiomyocytes to prevent teratoma formation in
   vivo. Current methods focus on the supplementation of soluble factors to
   culture medium to drive differentiation into mesodermal lineages;
   however, these methods are costly with varying cardiomyocyte yields.
   Since cardiomyocytes are exposed to dynamic environments in vivo, there
   is potential in using mechanical stimulation to further drive
   differentiation in vitro. In this review, we will describe the most
   recent developments in how mechanical stimulation, including fluid
   shear, cyclic strain, and magnetically mediated strain, can guide
   cardiomyogenesis in PSCs. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical

Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Deltas are complex ecogeomorphic systems where features such as channels
   and interchannel islands are present over a wide range of spatial
   scales. A quantitative description of the morphology of deltas is
   fundamental to address how they react to changes in climate forcing and
   human pressure. In particular, it is interesting to ask how the
   distributary patterns we observe in coastal areas around the world
   result from processes and external forcing acting on deltas, and how
   such patterns might be related to deltaic function, vulnerability, and
   resilience. Using the example of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Jamuna Delta, we
   show that the statistics of island size, shape factor, aspect ratio, and
   nearest-edge distance show distinct spatial patterns. Comparison between
   regions identified by our statistical analysis and a physiographic
   zonation of the delta suggests that the planform extracted from
   satellite imagery carries the signature of processes responsible for
   delta formation and evolution and of vegetation. The tidal region is
   characterized by high channel density, small islands, and short
   nearest-edge distance (shortest straight-line distance to the nearest
   water). The results suggest that regions of the delta characterized by
   presence of vegetation and active transport of water and sediment are
   statistically distinct from less active regions. Further, we perform a
   weighted connectivity analysis of the channel patterns based on channel
   width. The analysis suggests that channels connecting the upper portion
   of the delta to the coast do not play a significant role in the
   transport of water and sediment.}},

Abstract = {{Hurricane Ike (2008) made landfall near Galveston, Texas, as a moderate
   intensity storm. Its large wind field in conjunction with the
   Louisiana-Texas coastline's broad shelf and large scale concave geometry
   generated waves and surge that impacted over 1000 km of coastline. Ike's
   complex and varied wave and surge response physics included: the capture
   of surge by the protruding Mississippi River Delta; the strong influence
   of wave radiation stress gradients on the Delta adjacent to the shelf
   break; the development of strong wind driven shore-parallel currents and
   the associated geostrophic setup; the forced early rise of water in
   coastal bays and lakes facilitating inland surge penetration; the
   propagation of a free wave along the southern Texas shelf; shore-normal
   peak wind-driven surge; and resonant and reflected long waves across a
   wide continental shelf. Preexisting and rapidly deployed instrumentation
   provided the most comprehensive hurricane response data of any previous
   hurricane. More than 94 wave parameter time histories, 523 water level
   time histories, and 206 high water marks were collected throughout the
   Gulf in deep water, along the nearshore, and up to 65 km inland. Ike's
   highly varied physics were simulated using SWAN+ADCIRC, a tightly
   coupled wave and circulation model, on SL18TX33, a new unstructured mesh
   of the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and western Atlantic Ocean with
   high resolution of the Gulf's coastal floodplain from Alabama to the
   Texas-Mexico border. A comprehensive validation was made of the model's
   ability to capture the varied physics in the system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates model response sensitivities to mesh resolution,
   topographical details, bottom friction formulations, the interaction of
   wind waves and circulation, and nonlinear advection on tidal and
   hurricane surge and wave processes at the basin, shelf, wetland, and
   coastal channel scales within the Gulf of Mexico. Tides in the Gulf of
   Mexico are modestly energetic processes, whereas hurricane surge and
   waves are highly energetic. The unstructured-mesh, coupled wind-wave and
   circulation modeling system, SWAN+ADCIRC, is implemented to generate
   modeled tidal harmonic constituents and hurricane waves and surge for a
   Hurricane Ike (2008) hindcast. In the open ocean, mesh resolution
   requirements are less stringent in achieving accurate tidal signals or
   matching hurricane surge and wave responses; however, coarser resolution
   or the absence of intertidal zones decreases accuracy along protected
   nearshore and inland coastal areas due to improper conveyance and/or
   lateral attenuation. Bottom friction formulations are shown to have
   little impact on tidal signal accuracy, but hurricane surge is much more
   sensitive, especially in shelf waters, where development of a strong
   shore-parallel current is essential to the development of Ike's
   geostrophic setup. The spatial and temporal contributions of wave
   radiation stress gradients and nonlinear advection were charted for Ike.
   Nonlinear advection improves model performance by capturing an
   additional 10-20 cm of geostrophic setup and increasing resonant
   cross-shelf waves by 30-40 cm. Wave radiation stress gradients improve
   performance at coastal stations by adding an extra 20-40 cm to water
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{An important issue in the use of coal-or biomass-derived synthetic
   gaseous (syngas) fuels is the deposition of contaminants on film-cooled
   turbine surfaces, which alter cooling and aerodynamic performance and
   increase material degradation. The current study applied a new
   experimental technique that simulated the key physical aspects of
   contaminant deposition on a film-cooled turbine vane. The depositing
   contaminants were modeled in a wind tunnel facility with a spray of
   molten wax droplets of a size range that matched the Stokes number of
   the contaminant particles in engine conditions. Most experiments were
   performed using a vane model with a thermal conductivity selected such
   that the model had the same Biot number of an actual engine airfoil,
   resulting in a cooler surface temperature. Some experiments were
   performed using an approximately adiabatic model for comparison. The
   film cooling design consisted of three rows of showerhead cooling at the
   leading edge and one row of body film cooling holes on the pressure
   side. Two designs of pressure side body film cooling holes were
   considered: a standard design of straight, cylindrical holes and an
   advanced design of ``trenched{''} cooling holes in which the hole exits
   were situated in a recessed, transverse trench. The results showed thin
   deposits formed in the trench, with the thickest deposits on its
   downstream wall between coolant jets. Adiabatic film effectiveness
   levels were essentially unchanged by the presence of deposits for either
   film configuration. Deposit formation was strongly influenced by the
   model surface temperature with cooler surfaces inhibiting deposition.
   There was evidence of a threshold surface temperature above which
   deposits became significantly thicker.}},

Title = {{Measurements of Adiabatic Film and Overall Cooling Effectiveness on a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Film cooling performance is typically quantified by separating the
   external convective heat transfer from the other components of the
   conjugate heat transfer that occurs in turbine airfoils. However, it is
   also valuable to assess the conjugate heat transfer in terms of the
   overall cooling effectiveness, which is a parameter of importance to
   airfoil designers. In the current study, adiabatic film effectiveness
   and overall cooling effectiveness values were measured for the pressure
   side of a simplified turbine vane model with three rows of showerhead
   cooling at the leading edge and one row of body film cooling holes on
   the pressure side. This was done by utilizing two geometrically
   identical models made from different materials. Adiabatic film
   effectiveness was measured using a very low thermal conductivity
   material, and the overall cooling effectiveness was measured using a
   material with a higher thermal conductivity selected such that the Biot
   number of the model matched that of a turbine vane at engine conditions.
   The theoretical basis for this matched-Biot number modeling technique is
   discussed in some detail. Additionally, two designs of pressure side
   body film cooling holes were considered in this study: a standard design
   of straight, cylindrical holes and an advanced design of ``trenched{''}
   cooling holes in which the hole exits were situated in a recessed,
   transverse trench. This study was performed using engine representative
   flow conditions, including a coolant-to-mainstream density ratio of DR =
   1.4 and a mainstream turbulence intensity of Tu = 20\%. The results of
   this study show that adiabatic film and overall cooling effectiveness
   increase with blowing ratio for the showerhead and pressure side
   trenched holes. Performance decreases with blowing ratio for the
   standard holes due to coolant jet separation from the surface. Both body
   film designs have similar performance at a lower blowing ratio when the
   standard hole coolant jets remain attached. Far downstream of the
   cooling holes both designs perform similarly because film effectiveness
   decays more rapidly for the trenched holes.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of voltage regulation impacts on distribution circuits due to
   electric vehicle (EV) battery loads requires accurate representation of
   the charging system. An EV charger consists of power electronic switches
   with PWM control to achieve desired charging characteristics while
   minimizing harmonic injections to the secondary service entrance. A
   detailed device-level model is accurate but it requires a significant
   amount of time to run due to the high switching frequency of the
   converter. For this reason, a novel and generic model of EV battery
   chargers is proposed and developed for evaluating distribution voltage
   regulation issues. The proposed model is developed based on the
   average-value modeling (AVM) approach. It includes a rectifier circuit
   along with PWM control, boost converter and battery banks. Average
   dynamics of the switching circuit are obtained by averaging the effects
   of fast switching in the device that occur within a prototypical
   switching interval. The proposed AVM is validated against a switching
   model and the actual measurements taken at an EV charging facility and
   is found to be very accurate in approximating EV charger behavior.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Breaking time-reversal symmetry enables the realization of
   non-reciprocal devices, such as isolators and circulators, of
   fundamental importance in microwave and photonic communication systems.
   This effect is almost exclusively achieved today through magneto-optical
   phenomena, which are incompatible with integrated technology because of
   the required large magnetic bias. However, this is not the only option
   to break reciprocity. The Onsager-Casimir principle states that any odd
   vector under time reversal, such as electric current and linear
   momentum, can also produce a non-reciprocal response. These recently
   analysed alternatives typically work over a limited portion of the
   electromagnetic spectrum and/or are often characterized by weak effects,
   requiring large volumes of operation. Here we show that these
   limitations may be overcome by angular momentum-biased metamaterials, in
   which a properly tailored spatiotemporal modulation is azimuthally
   applied to subwavelength Fano-resonant inclusions, producing largely
   enhanced non-reciprocal response at the subwavelength scale, in
   principle applicable from radio to optical frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional materials have been an ideal material platform for
   constructing flexible ultrathin-film supercapacitors, offering great
   advantages of flexibility, ultra-thinness and even transparency.
   Exploring new two-dimensional pseudocapacitive materials with high

   The material exhibits a high potential plateau of similar to 1.0 V in
   aqueous solutions, approaching the electrochemical potential window of
   water (1.23 V). The as-established flexible supercapacitor achieves a
   high redox potential (1.0 V) and a high areal capacitance of 8,360.5 mu

Abstract = {{Carrier aggregation (CA) and small cells are two distinct features of
   next-generation cellular networks. Cellular networks with different
   types of small cells are often referred to as HetNets. In this paper, we
   introduce a load-aware model for CA-enabled multi-band HetNets. Under
   this model, the impact of biasing can be more appropriately
   characterized; for example, it is observed that with large enough
   biasing, the spectral efficiency of small cells may increase while its
   counterpart in a fully-loaded model always decreases. Further, our
   analysis reveals that the peak data rate does not depend on the base
   station density and transmit powers; this strongly motivates other
   approaches e. g. CA to increase the peak data rate. Last but not least,
   different band deployment configurations are studied and compared. We
   find that with large enough small cell density, spatial reuse with small
   cells outperforms adding more spectrum for increasing user rate. More
   generally, universal cochannel deployment typically yields the largest
   rate; and thus a capacity loss exists in orthogonal deployment. This
   performance gap can be reduced by appropriately tuning the HetNet
   coverage distribution (e. g. by optimizing biasing factors).}},

Abstract = {{Efficient bacterial genetic engineering approaches with broad-host
   applicability are rare. We combine two systems, mobile group II introns
   ('targetrons') and Cre/lox, which function efficiently in many different
   organisms, into a versatile platform we call GETR (Genome Editing via
   Targetrons and Recombinases). The introns deliver lox sites to specific
   genomic loci, enabling genomic manipulations. Efficiency is enhanced by
   adding flexibility to the RNA hairpins formed by the lox sites. We use
   the system for insertions, deletions, inversions, and one-step
   cut-and-paste operations. We demonstrate insertion of a 12-kb polyketide
   synthase operon into the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli, multiple
   simultaneous and sequential deletions of up to 120 kb in E. coli and
   Staphylococcus aureus, inversions of up to 1.2Mb in E. coli and Bacillus
   subtilis, and one-step cut-and-pastes for translocating 120 kb of
   genomic sequence to a site 1.5Mb away. We also demonstrate the
   simultaneous delivery of lox sites into multiple loci in the Shewanella
   oneidensis genome. No selectable markers need to be placed in the
   genome, and the efficiency of Cre-mediated manipulations typically
   approaches 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm communities in four bench-scale nitrifying biofilters degrading

   next-generation high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing. On average, the

   (14\%), and Chitinophagaceae (9\%) with the dominant bacterial
   operational taxonomic unit (OTU) related to the ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB) Nitrosomonas oligotropha. Even though ammonia-oxidizing
   archaea (AOA) have been reported in drinking water systems, the current
   study generated no PCR product or a very low yield of detectable Archaea
   amplicons, which may be attributed to biofilter operating conditions
   {[}e.g., 4 mg N/L TOTNH3 (sum of ammonia-nitrogen and
   ammonium-nitrogen)] that promoted AOB compared with AOA growth.
   Spatially within a given biofilter (influent to the effluent), OTU

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) offers a cost-effective means to
   image blood flow in vivo. However, it is not commonly used to image
   rodent retinas because of the challenges associated with imaging through
   the curved cornea and delivering light through the highly scattering
   lens. A solution to overcome these problems by using LSCI in conjunction
   with an endoscope to obtain high spatiotemporal blood flow images is
   described. Its utility is demonstrated by imaging blood flow changes in
   rat retinas using hyperoxic, hypercapnic, and visual (flicker)
   stimulations. Hypercapnia increases blood flow, hyperoxia decreases
   blood flow, and visual stimulation increases blood flow in the retina
   relative to basal conditions. The time-to-peak of the LSCI response to
   visual stimulation is also measured. This approach may prove useful to
   investigate dysregulation in blood flow-evoked responses in retinal
   diseases and to evaluate treatment strategies in rodents. (C) The

   barriers that must be overcome during vesicle formation. In contrast,
   protein coats and their associated accessory proteins drive membrane
   bending using a variety of interdependent physical mechanisms. We survey
   the energy costs and drivers involved in membrane curvature, and draw a
   contrast between the stochastic contributions of molecular crowding and
   the deterministic assembly of protein coats. These basic principles also
   apply to other cellular examples of membrane bending events, including

Abstract = {{Environmental sustainability is of great concern among world
   organizations and enterprises due to recent trends in global warming.
   Many developed nations have put in place stricter environmental
   regulations. Industries in such nations have established full-fledged
   systems to adopt environment friendly operation strategies to lower
   their overall carbon footprint. Currently, there is increased awareness
   among customers even in developing countries about eco friendly
   manufacturing solutions. Multi-national firms have identified economies
   of developed nations as a potential market for their products. Such
   organizations in developing countries like India and China are under
   pressure to adopt green concepts in supply chain operations to compete
   in the market and satisfy their customers' increasing needs. This paper
   offers a comparative study of pressures that impact the adoption of
   Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM). Thirty two pressures are
   identified from extensive literature reviews and they are classified
   into five distinct groups based on their similarities. A detailed
   questionnaire is prepared and circulated among industries in various
   sectors. Industries were requested through this survey to rate the
   impact of each pressure. Two independent hypotheses were formulated from
   literature to test the nature of impact and the differences affecting
   Indian industries. Statistical data analysis through one-way single
   factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by pair-wise comparison of
   means using Tukey's test was used. The analysis was performed for
   different sectors and different scales of production categories. The
   results and their implications are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Stereoscopic/3D image and video quality assessment (IQA/VQA) has become
   increasing relevant in today's world, owing to the amount of attention
   that has recently been focused on 3D/stereoscopic cinema, television,
   gaming, and mobile video. Understanding the quality of experience of
   human viewers as they watch 3D videos is a complex and
   multi-disciplinary problem. Toward this end we offer a holistic
   assessment of the issues that are encountered, survey the progress that
   has been made towards addressing these issues, discuss ongoing efforts
   to resolve them, and point up the future challenges that need to be
   focused on. Important tools in the study of the quality of 3D visual
   signals are databases of 3D image and video sets, distorted versions of
   these signals and the results of large-scale studies of human opinions
   of their quality. We explain the construction of one such tool, the LIVE
   3D IQA database, which is the first publicly available 3D IQA database
   that incorporates `true' depth information along with stereoscopic pairs
   and human opinion scores. We describe the creation of the database and
   analyze the performance of a variety of 2D and 3D quality models using
   the new database. The database as well as the algorithms evaluated are
   available for researchers in the field to use in order to enable
   objective comparisons of future algorithms. Finally, we broadly
   summarize the field of 3D QA focusing on key unresolved problems
   including stereoscopic distortions, 3D masking, and algorithm
   development. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Unraveling the Myths Associated With Selecting Standalone Screens and a

Journal = {{SPE DRILLING \& COMPLETION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Many completion engineers use laboratory sand-retention testing as a
   tool to select a screen for standalone sand-control applications, some
   focusing on prepack and others on slurry testing. Those who use slurry
   tests for screen selection typically do so on the basis of the
   conventional wisdom that slurry testing is more challenging; thus, it
   represents the worst-case scenario for sand production. Furthermore, the
   general belief in the industry has been that metal-mesh screens with a
   ``pore structure{''} are better for sand retention compared with
   wire-wrap screens (WWSs) of slot geometry, although they are more prone
   to ``plugging.{''} These are just a few of the many myths that exist in
   screen selection for standalone screen (SAS) applications.
   Recent papers on the modeling of sand retention by screens of various
   geometries, and supported by laboratory experiments, provided the tools
   for predicting sand production in both prepack and slurry conditions, as
   well as allowing for a systematic performance comparison of various
   screens by use of the entire particle-size distribution (PSD) of
   formation sands (Mondal et al. 2011 and 2012; Chanpura et al. 2012,
   2013).
   In this paper, we discuss and challenge many myths in the screen
   selection for SAS applications and substantiate our findings with
   modeling and experimental data. The conditions under which a slurry or a
   prepack test would be more conservative are identified, highlighting the
   mechanisms of sand retention (size exclusion or bridging dominated). We
   demonstrate that the current thinking that prepack tests are always more
   conservative from a sand-production standpoint is incorrect. We also
   show that the concept that metal-mesh screens are always superior for
   sand retention than WWSs is incorrect, highlighting the factors that
   affect sand production through various screens {[}e.g., open flow area
   (OFA), wire thickness, and fraction of bridging-sized particles in the
   formation sand]. Finally, a methodology for screen selection in SAS
   applications is proposed.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{A high-occupancy/toll (HOT) lane is an increasingly popular form of
   traffic management strategy which reserves a set of freeway lanes for
   HOVs and transit users, while allowing low-occupancy vehicles (LOVs) to
   enter for a fee. In turn, HOT lanes maintain a minimal level of service
   by regulating the volume of entering LOVs. The focus of this paper is
   how to model the choice process of individual drivers, which dictates
   the volume of LOVs that choose to pay and take the HOT lane. Such models
   and the insights they provide can be very helpful for the toll setting
   process. Two simple formulations (an all-or-nothing assignment and an
   additive logit model) are compared with a proposed formulation based on
   the population value of time (VOT) distribution. Both static and dynamic
   toll setting algorithms are studied based on the proposed lane choice
   model, and their performance is compared under deterministic traffic
   behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we examine delay limited adaptive quantization on the
   Grassmann manifold of 1-dimensional subspaces in n-dimensional space.
   Due to strict delay limits, vector quantization over multiple time
   instants cannot be applied to exploit the temporal correlation of the
   source signal. Instead, a vector predictive quantizer is proposed that
   combines prediction and differential quantization algorithms to achieve
   an efficient quantization of the correlated Grassmannian source. The
   proposed predictor is based on adaptive finite impulse response filters
   to adjust to the temporal statistics of the source signal. It is shown
   that the prediction error in the tangent space associated with the
   Grassmann manifold behaves approximately Gaussian, provided its norm is
   sufficiently small. The proposed quantization algorithm is applied to
   channel state information quantization in multi-user beamforming
   wireless communication systems. Large throughput gains are demonstrated
   in comparison to memoryless quantization, due to reduced multi-user
   interference.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we study non-parametric hypothesis testing problem with
   distribution function constraints. The empirical likelihood ratio test
   has been widely used in testing problems with moment (in) equality
   constraints. However, some detection problems cannot be described using
   moment (in)equalities. We propose a distribution function constraint
   along with an empirical likelihood ratio test. This detector is
   applicable to a wide variety of robust parametric/non-parametric
   detection problems. Since the distribution function constraints provide
   a more exact description of the null hypothesis, the test outperforms
   the empirical likelihood ratio test with moment constraints as well as
   many popular goodness-of-fit tests, such as the robust
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Cramer-von Mises test. Examples from
   communication systems with real-world noise samples are provided to show
   their performance. Specifically, the proposed test significantly
   outperforms the robust Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Cramer-von Mises
   test when the null hypothesis is nested in the alternative hypothesis.
   The same example is repeated when we assume no noise uncertainty. By
   doing so, we are able to claim that in our case, it is necessary to
   include uncertainty in noise distribution. Additionally, the asymptotic

Abstract = {{Acquiring new field information can reduce the uncertainty about the
   reservoir properties and can (but not necessarily) alter decisions
   affecting the deployment of a CCS project. The main objective of this
   paper is to provide a decision-analytic framework to quantify the value
   of acquiring additional information regarding reservoir permeability.
   Uncertainty in reservoir characterization translates into risks of CO2
   migration out of the containment zone (or lease zone) and non-compliance
   with contractual requirements on CO2 storage capacity. The field we
   consider is based on an actual, and mature, field located in Texas.
   Subsurface modeling of the injection zone was conducted using well logs,
   field-specific GIS data, and other relevant published literature. The
   value of information (VOI) was quantified by defining prior scenarios
   based on the current knowledge of the reservoir, contractual
   requirements, and regulatory constraints. The project operator has the
   option to obtain more reliable estimates of permeability, which will
   help reduce the uncertainty of the CO2 plume behavior and storage
   capacity of the formation. The reliability of the information-gathering
   activities is then applied to the prior probabilities (Bayesian
   inference) to infer the value of such data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the unsteady hydrodynamic analysis of marine propellers
   and horizontal-axis tidal current turbines is performed by using a
   vortex lattice method (VLM). A fully unsteady wake alignment algorithm
   is implemented into the VLM to satisfy the force-free condition on the
   propeller and turbine wake surfaces. It was found that the position of
   the trailing wake is very important in predicting the performance of
   propellers or turbines in steady or unsteady flow. The effects of a
   non-linear interaction between the inflow and the propeller/turbine
   blades have been taken into account by using a hybrid viscous/potential
   flow method, which couples the potential flow solver for the unsteady
   analysis of the propeller/turbine and a viscous flow solver for the
   prediction of the viscous flow field around them. The present method is
   then applied to predict unsteady hydrodynamic performance of a propeller
   and a horizontal-axis tidal current turbine. The predicted unsteady
   forces of a propeller subject to an inclined inflow are compared with
   those from experiments. The hydrodynamic performance of tidal turbine in
   yawed flow for various yaw angles is investigated. The numerical results
   are compared with existing experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{A general purpose guidance, navigation, and control algorithm is
   developed for satellites with three degree-of-freedom rotation
   maneuverability. The algorithm is capable of meeting multiple pointing
   constraints autonomously by using a combination of constrained attitude
   pathfinding and control elements. The unit sphere is discretized into a
   graph using an icosahedron-based pixelization subroutine. An admissible
   path between attitude keep-out zones is found with the A{*} pathfinding
   algorithm. The trajectory is followed using a rate and torque
   constrained quaternion feedback controller. The algorithm is capable of
   running in real time on a low-power flight computer. An embedded version
   of the algorithm has secured flight opportunities on two student-built
   three-unit CubeSats. Both sets of mission requirements are satisfied
   with the same three-unit CubeSat attitude control system, demonstrating
   the algorithm's versatility as a general purpose controller. The
   autonomy provided by the constrained control algorithm enables more
   complex satellite missions to be performed and decreases the cost of
   spacecraft subsystems by shifting requirements away from the hardware
   and onto the control algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented to calculate optimal trajectories to near-Earth
   asteroids that incorporate free-return trajectory segments. These
   trajectories are useful because they return to Earth with no fuel
   penalty, which is useful for risk mitigation on manned missions. The
   algorithm minimizes total velocity change over an entire nominal
   mission, encompassing a single impulsive maneuver each for Earth
   departure, leaving the free-return trajectory, rendezvous with and
   departure from the asteroid, culminating with unpowered reentry into
   Earth's atmosphere. Two example cases are presented in the circular
   restricted three-body model: a mission to 2000 SG344 from 23 August 2028
   to 9 October 2029 with a cost of 5.307 km/s, and a mission to 2006 BZ147
   from 9 February 2033 to 21 December 2033 with a cost of 7.000 km /s. The

Abstract = {{Software evolution is an increasingly challenging and compelling concern
   for every developed software system because of the changes in the
   requirements, the technology, etc. When software evolution is carried
   out, software architecture emerges as one of the cornerstones that
   should be considered from two different points of view: as an artifact
   for the evolution, as it helps the architect plan and restructure the
   system, and as an artifact of the evolution, because it has to be
   modified as well. This paper focuses on the second point of viewthat is,
   on the evolution of the software architecture, but taking into account
   architectural knowledge as a key driver of the process. Given that
   architecture rationale and design intent are critical in evolving
   software systems, it is imperative that they be captured in some useful
   form to aid that evolution process. We present a new approach for
   evolution styles that extends them by considering in their description
   the architectural knowledge as a valuable asset of the evolution
   process. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Control of gene and protein expression of both endogenous and
   heterologous genes is a key component of metabolic engineering. While a
   large amount of work has been published characterizing promoters for
   this purpose, less effort has been exerted to elucidate the role of
   terminators in yeast. In this study, we characterize over 30
   terminations for use in metabolic engineering applications in
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine mRNA changes to be the major
   cause of the varied protein and transcript expression level. We
   demonstrate that the difference in transcript level can be over 6.5-fold
   even for high strength promoters. The influence of terminator selection
   is magnified when coupled with a low-expression promoter, with a maximum
   difference in protein expression of 11-fold between an
   expression-enhancing terminator and the parent plasmid terminator and
   over 35-fold difference when compared with a no-terminator baseline.
   This is the first time that terminators have been investigated in the
   context of multiple promoters spanning orders of magnitude in activity.
   Finally, we demonstrate the utility of terminator selection for
   metabolic engineering by using a mutant xylose isomerase gene as a
   proof-of-concept. Through pairing an expression-enhancing terminator
   with a low-expression promoter, we were able to achieve the same
   phenotypic result as with a promoter considerably higher in strength.
   Moreover, we can further boost the phenotype of the high-strength
   promoter by pairing it with an expression-enhancing terminator. This
   work highlights how terminator elements can be used to control metabolic
   pathways in the same way that promoters are traditionally used in yeast.
   Together, this work demonstrates that terminators will be an important
   part of heterologous gene expression and metabolic engineering for yeast
   in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly all code provisions for the shear capacity of structural concrete
   members without shear reinforcement have been empirically derived and
   some were calibrated decades ago. Since then, a significant volume of
   new test data has been generated that can aid our understanding. To
   address this issue, a database of 439 shear test results had been
   created in 2003 that contained the data of beams without shear
   reinforcement subjected to point loads. The 2003 database was
   considerably expanded in recent years by a joint ACI-DAfStb Group, with
   new test data including 40 tests on beams with uniformly distributed
   loads. The newly extended database now contains 784 tests that can be
   used for the evaluation of shear design provisions.
   A comparison of ACI 318-11 Eq. (11-3) with this extended database has
   revealed that current code provisions can be unconservative for large,
   lightly reinforced members and that the influences of important

   in the estimates of the obtained effects (quality of evidence) was
   assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
   and Evaluation approach. We identified seven controlled trials, six
   non-randomized and one randomized, including a total of 941 patients.
   Studies were at high risk of bias. No difference was observed between
   RMN and MCN on AF recurrence {[}OR 1.18, 95 confidence interval (CI)
   0.85 to 1.65, P 0.32] or PVI (OR 0.41, 95 CI 0.111.47, P 0.17). Remote
   magnetic navigation was associated with less peri-procedural
   complications (Peto OR 0.41, 95 CI 0.190.88, P 0.02). Mean fluoroscopy
   time was reduced in RMN group (22.22 min; 95 CI 42.48 to 1.96, P 0.03),
   although the overall duration of the procedure was longer (60.91 min; 95
   CI 31.17 to 90.65, P 0.0001). In conclusion, RMN is not superior to MCN
   in achieving freedom from recurrent AF at mid-term follow-up or PVI. The
   procedure implies less peri-procedural complications, requires a shorter
   fluoroscopy time but a longer total procedural time. For the low quality
   of the available evidence, a proper designed randomized controlled trial
   could turn the direction and the effect of the dimensions explored.}},

Abstract = {{We present a cost-efficient and rapid prototyping technique for
   polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microfluidic devices using a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based hot embossing process. Compared to
   conventional hot embossing methods, this technique uses PDMS molds with
   enhanced thermo-mechanical properties. To improve the replication
   performance, increases in both PDMS stiffness and hardness were achieved
   through several processing and curing means. First, the amount of curing
   agent was increased from 1/10 to 1/5 with respect to the amount of
   prepolymer. Second, the cured PDMS was thermally aged either over three
   days at 85 degrees C or for 30 min at 250 degrees C. Those combined
   steps led to increases in stiffness and hardness of up to 150\% and
   32\%, respectively, as compared to standard PDMS molds. Using these
   enhanced molds, structures with features of the order of 100 mu m in
   PMMA are successfully embossed using a standard laboratory press at 150
   degrees C. The PDMS molds and process produce identical structures
   through multiple embossing cycles (>= 10) without any mold damage or
   deterioration. A Y-shaped microfluidic mixer was fabricated with this
   technique. The successful demonstration of this enhanced PDMS-based hot
   embossing technique introduces a new approach for the rapid prototyping
   of polymer-based microfluidic devices at low-cost.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline LiFePO4 powders synthesized by a microwave-assisted
   solvothermal (MW-ST) process have been structurally characterized with a
   combination of high resolution powder neutron diffraction, synchrotron
   X-ray diffraction, and aberration-corrected HAADF STEM imaging. A
   significant level of defects has been found in the samples prepared at
   255 and 275 degrees C. These temperatures are significantly higher than
   what has previously been suggested to be the maximum temperature for
   defect formation in LiFePO4, so the presence of defects is likely
   related to the rapid MW-ST synthesis involving a short reaction time
   (similar to 5 min). A defect model has been tentatively proposed, though
   it has been shown that powder diffraction data alone cannot conclusively
   determine the precise defect distribution in LiFePO4 samples. The model
   is consistent with other literature reports on nanopowders synthesized
   at low temperatures, in which the unit cell volume is significantly
   reduced relative to defect-free, micron-sized LiFePO4 powders. Published

Abstract = {{Prime coats have been widely used to protect sub-base layers during
   pavement construction. The engineering properties of a prime-coated base

   The prime coats were either sprayed on or mixed with the base course to
   evaluate the effect of the application method. In addition, penetration
   of the prime coats into reference sand was evaluated. For the conditions
   of this study, according to a developed ranking system, the best
   performing prime coats were TP and MC-30, with slightly better
   performance from TP. The results provided here can be used as a

Title = {{Monochloramine cometabolism by Nitrosomonas europaea under drinking

Abstract = {{Chloramine is widely used in United States drinking water systems as a
   secondary disinfectant, which may promote the growth of nitrifying
   bacteria because ammonia is present. At the onset of nitrification, both
   nitrifying bacteria and their products exert a monochloramine demand,
   decreasing the residual disinfectant concentration in water distribution
   systems. This work investigated another potentially significant
   mechanism for residual disinfectant loss: monochloramine cometabolism by
   ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB).
   Monochloramine cometabolism was studied with the pure culture AOB
   Nitrosomonas europaea (ATCC 19718) in batch kinetic experiments under
   drinking water conditions. Three batch reactors were used in each
   experiment: a positive control to estimate the ammonia kinetic
   parameters, a negative control to account for abiotic reactions, and a
   cometabolism reactor to estimate the cometabolism kinetic constants.
   Kinetic parameters were estimated in AQUASIM with a simultaneous fit to
   all experimental data. The cometabolism reactors showed a more rapid
   monochloramine decay than in the negative controls, demonstrating that
   cometabolism occurs. Cometabolism kinetics were best described by a
   pseudo first order model with a reductant term to account for ammonia
   availability. Monochloramine cometabolism kinetics were similar to those
   of ammonia metabolism, and monochloramine cometabolism was a significant
   loss mechanism (30-60\% of the observed monochloramine decay). These
   results suggest that monochloramine cometabolism should occur in
   practice and may be a significant contribution to monochloramine decay
   during nitrification episodes in drinking water distribution systems.

Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{262}},
Pages = {{358-364}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Growing energy demand and the push to move toward carbon-free ways of
   electricity generation have renewed the world's interest in nuclear
   energy. Due to the high technical and economic uncertainties related to
   nuclear energy, simulation tools have become a necessity in order to
   plan and evaluate possible nuclear fuel cycles (NFCs). Most of the NFC
   simulators today work by running the simulation with a user-defined set
   of facility build orders and preferences. While this allows for a simple
   way to change the simulation conditions, it may not always lead to
   optimal results and strongly relies on the user defining the correct
   parameters. This study looks into the possibility of using the expected
   cost of electricity (CoE) as the driving build decision variable instead
   of relying on user-defined build orders. This is a first step toward a
   more general decision making strategy in dynamic fuel cycle simulation.
   For this purpose, additional modules were implemented in an NFC
   simulator, VEGAS, with the consumption dependent price of uranium as a
   time-varying NFC cost component that drives the cost competitiveness of
   available NFC options. The model was demonstrated to verify the correct
   operation of a CoE-driven NFC simulator. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper develops and estimates a multiple discrete continuous extreme
   value model of household activity generation that jointly predicts the
   activity participation decisions of all individuals in a household by
   activity purpose and the precise combination of individuals
   participating. The model is estimated on a sample obtained from the post
   census regional household travel survey conducted by the South
   California Association of Governments in the year 2000. A host of
   household, individual, and residential neighborhood accessibility
   measures are used as explanatory variables. The results reveal that, in
   addition to household and individual demographics, the built environment
   of the home zone also impacts the activity participation levels and
   durations of households. A validation exercise is undertaken to evaluate
   the ability of the proposed model to predict participation levels and
   durations. In addition to providing richness in behavioral detail, the
   model can be easily embedded in an activity-based microsimulation
   framework and is computationally efficient as it obviates the need for
   several hierarchical sub-models typically used in extant activity-based
   systems to generate activity patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Synergistic interactions at the interface of nanoparticles (bare
   colloidal silica) and surfactant (caprylamidopropyl betaine) led to the
   generation of viscous and stable CO2-in-water (C/W) foams with fine
   texture at 19.4 MPa and 50 degrees C. Interestingly, neither species
   generated C/W foams alone. The surfactant became cationic in the
   presence of CO2 and adsorbed on the hydrophilic silica nanoparticle
   surfaces resulting in an increase in the carbon
   dioxide/water/nanoparticle contact angle. The surfactant also adsorbed
   at the CO2-water interface, reducing interfacial tension to allow
   formation of finer bubbles. The foams were generated in a beadpack and
   characterized by apparent viscosity measurements both in the beadpack
   and in a capillary tube viscometer. In addition, the macroscopic foam
   stability was observed visually. The foam texture and viscosity were
   tunable by controlling the aqueous phase composition. Foam stability is
   discussed in terms of lamella drainage, disjoining pressure, interfacial
   viscosity, and hole formation. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical

Title = {{Thermal effects on polybrominated diphenyl ether mass transfer and
   emission from computer cases}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{343-351}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The increase in temperature of some consumer products, especially
   electronic devices, results in an increase of semivolatile organic
   compound (SVOC) emissions. Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs), such as
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), are used in many electronic
   casings and circuit boards to protect consumers from fires. However, the
   heat from the internal circuitry increases the SVOC vapor pressure and
   the material-air partition coefficient decreases, driving SVOC transport
   out of the substrate and into the indoor environment. In the case of a
   computer tower, the cooling fan also increases the mass transfer
   coefficient, further increasing emissions. Such enhanced emissions are a
   concern since recent studies claim adverse health effects of PBDEs on
   human health. In this study, a simplified heat and mass transfer model
   is developed to characterize the combined heat and mass transfer problem
   for a computer tower in an indoor space to determine the levels of PBDE
   that would be outgassed. As expected, higher temperatures increase the
   emission rate of the SVOC and explain one of the transport mechanisms
   for BFRs into the environment. The emission rate of PBDEs was on the
   order of tens of nanograms per hour. The concentration of PBDEs in the
   air increases 40-80\% for every 5 degrees C increase inside the computer
   case, depending on the congener. If these emission rates prove to be
   toxicologically significant, then models such as the one proposed can be
   used in risk analysis modeling and to develop mitigation strategies. (C)

Abstract = {{We experimentally evaluate the performance of incoherent multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) multimode fiber (MMF) links with different fiber
   media, link lengths, and modulation techniques. The performance of
   conventional 62.5 mu m diameter silica as well as perfluorinated
   plastic, graded-index MMF sections of various lengths were evaluated
   using 1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3 and 4 x 4 MIMO setups over a range of lengths,
   with both open-loop equalization and feedback-based spatial multiplexing
   techniques. The data rate was evaluated over silica fiber sections with
   lengths ranging between 100 m-3 km using distributed feedback lasers and
   VCSELs at the transmitters. In addition, plastic optical fiber sections
   with lengths ranging from 1 m-100 m were evaluated with Fabry Perot
   lasers. Axial offsets were introduced while launching into, and
   detecting from the MMF to enhance modal diversity, and the impact of
   these offsets on the data rates was measured to obtain optimal launch
   and detection conditions. With optimized launch conditions and
   modulation parameters, the silica based systems realized data rates of
   16 to 26 Gb/s, representing a bandwidth-length product improvement of
   28x over MMF standards such as 10 GBASE-SR. The plastic fiber system
   reached data rates of 24 to 43 Gb/s, with bandwidth-length product
   increases of up to 12x of rated parameters. The use of off-axis launch
   and detection with flexible offsets on all four MIMO streams of the 4 x
   4 system would enable further performance improvement.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the influence of Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) on the
   mechanical and thermal behavior, EDZ was artificially generated around
   an existing circular hole in a mortar specimen. By applying high
   compressive stresses on the boundaries of a specimen and repeating
   loading and unloading cycles, EDZ was generated around the hole. An
   engineering heater was installed at the hole and the temperature of the
   heater was maintained at 75A degrees C during the tests. Tangential
   strains and temperature were monitored at several points around the hole
   and compared to those measured in the specimen without EDZ. For
   elliptical and circular damaged zones, the tangential strain in the EDZ
   increased by as much as 88\% and 58\%, respectively and temperature in
   the EDZ decreased by 2.8A degrees C and 0.85A degrees C, respectively.
   Two-dimensional thermal-mechanical coupled numerical simulation using
   Particle Flow Code 2D (PFC2D) was carried out to analyze and to
   demonstrate the experimental results. For the numerical simulation,
   thermal parameters were determined using the results obtained from
   sensitivity analyses by a factorial design method. The TM-coupled PFC2D
   modeling results indicated that significant changes in mechanical and
   thermal behavior were observed, when the elliptical and circular EDZ was
   considered. And that the laboratory test results were successfully
   reproduced.}},

Abstract = {{Improving energy efficiency has become particularly important in
   chemical processes in view of recent increases in energy prices, growing
   environmental concerns, and regulatory pressure. In this paper, we
   consider a class of process systems with significant energy recovery.
   Extending our previous results concerning the two time scale dynamics of
   such systems, we demonstrate that the fast component of the dynamics is
   asymptotically stable in practical cases. Using this result, we develop
   a hierarchical control framework, consisting of a linear control system
   for the fast dynamics and a MISO nonlinear model predictive controller
   for the slow dynamics, and prove that it guarantees exponential
   stability for the overall system. Subsequently, we explore the
   implications of this approach in economic model predictive control and
   optimal energy management. We illustrate our theoretical developments
   with a benchmark chemical process application. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Circuit timing is becoming more and more uncertain under greater process
   variation as technology scales. Given the fault probability of each
   timing path and their statistical correlation from a statistical timing
   framework, the path selection problem for delay faults has a nature
   similar to the problem of designing a portfolio of stocks or assets or
   determining the size of bets in gambling to minimize risk. This
   observation allows us to develop a very different path selection
   approach from the conventional ones. If selection of k paths is required
   in a set of paths, we partition the set into two path sets and determine
   how many paths should be selected in each path set out of the k paths
   based on the probabilities of each path set containing faulty paths. We
   recursively continue this process, which results in the paths to be
   targeted during tests. The partitioning is easily performed because the
   paths are already grouped into the depth-first search tree based on
   their suffix or prefix. Experimental results show that the proposed
   algorithm can effectively use the correlation to generate high-quality
   path sets. In addition, we study the issues that occur after automatic
   test pattern generation on the selected paths, and discuss possible
   solutions to them.}},

Abstract = {{Several different modifiers are increasingly being used to improve the
   performance of asphalt binders (e.g.,polymers) or to promote
   environmentally friendly technologies (e.g.,warm-mix asphalt, ground
   tire rubber, and organic waste). In such cases, it is important to
   evaluate the inherent improvement in engineering properties and damage
   resistance of the asphalt binders while being subjected to a state of
   stress that is similar to full asphalt mixtures. The first part of the
   paper presents a review of the literature that investigates the state of
   stress of the asphalt binder in an asphalt mixture as well as the test
   methods that have been used to achieve this state of stress
   experimentally. The second part of the paper presents a test method by
   which the fatigue-cracking characteristics of four different asphalt
   binders with similar true temperature grades were evaluated. Composite
   test specimens were fabricated using asphalt binders and glass beads
   with a specified gradation. The viscoelastic and fatigue-cracking
   characteristics of the binders were measured using the glass bead-binder
   composite specimens in a dynamic shear rheometer at an intermediate
   temperature. Results were analyzed using viscoelastic continuum damage
   theory. Damage evolution in the glass bead-binder test specimens used in
   this study was qualitatively very similar to the damage evolution in
   full asphalt mixtures using the same binders.}},

Abstract = {{Many theoretical and empirical models exist to predict the effective
   thermal conductivity of polymer foams. However, most of the models only
   consider the effect of porosity, while the pore size effect is ignored.
   The objective of this study is to understand the effect of pore size on
   the thermal conductivity of polymer foams, especially when it reduces to
   the micro and nanometer scales. A wide range of pore sizes from 1 nm to
   1 mm were studied in conjunction with the porosity effect using finite
   element analysis and molecular dynamics simulation methods. Experimental
   data was used to validate the modeling result. It is shown that the pore
   size has significant effect on thermal conductivity, even for
   microcellular and conventional foams. The contribution of heat
   conduction through air is negligible when pore size is reduced to the
   micrometer scale. The extremely low thermal conductivity of nanofoams is
   attributed to extensive diffusive scattering of heat carriers in the
   solid phase of polymer matrix, instead of air. This study provides
   quantitative understanding of the pore size effect on thermal
   conductivity of polymer foams. It is also shown that polyetherimide
   (PEI) nanofoams could have a thermal conductivity as low as 0.015 W/m-K.

   Cyclone}},

Abstract = {{The wetted wall bioaerosol sampling cyclone (WWC) is a complex
   multiphase flow device which collects and concentrates dilute
   bioaerosols into liquid samples for biological analysis (McFarland et
   al., 2009, ``Wetted Wall Cyclones for Bioaerosol Sampling,{''}Aerosol
   Sci. Technol., 44(4), pp. 241-252). Understanding heat and mass transfer
   processes occurring inside the WWC is the key to enhancing its
   performance through an effective coupling to lab-on-chip analysis
   platforms which require small volumes of liquid output. There exists a
   critical liquid input rate below which there is no sample collection
   since all liquid is lost to evaporative effects. The purpose of this
   study was to model critical film evaporation based on first principles
   and develop semi-empirical WWC performance correlations as an
   improvement to existing empirical correlations. A one-dimensional,
   coupled heat and mass transfer model was developed approximating WWC
   multiphase flow as cocurrent air-film flow. Governing equations were
   simplified and approximate solutions were used to optimize model
   parameters like the heat transfer coefficient based on empirical data
   from previous works. Optimized model parameters were then used in the
   full numerical solution to calculate liquid evaporation rates within the
   WWC over the full range of relative humidity and air temperature.
   Semi-empirical correlations developed in this study were compared to
   existing empirical models and showed much improvement: proper physical
   behavior at the extreme limits of temperature and relative humidity was
   observed, and the nonlinear dependence of evaporative effects on
   environmental conditions was also captured.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) can cause devastating neurological
   deficits, including impairment or loss of upper limb and hand function.
   A majority of the spinal cord injuries in humans occur at the cervical
   levels. Therefore, developing cervical injury models and developing
   relevant and sensitive behavioral tests is of great importance. Here we
   describe the use of a newly developed forelimb step-alternation test
   after cervical spinal cord injury in rats. In addition, we describe two
   behavioral tests that have not been used after spinal cord injury: a
   postural instability test (PIT), and a pasta-handling test. All three
   behavioral tests are highly sensitive to injury and are easy to use.
   Therefore, we feel that these behavioral tests can be instrumental in
   investigating therapeutic strategies after cSCI.}},

Abstract = {{We present a pore network model to determine the permeability of shale
   gas matrix. Contrary to the conventional reservoirs, where permeability
   is only a function of topology and morphology of the pores, the
   permeability in shale depends on pressure as well. In addition to
   traditional viscous flow of Hagen-Poiseuille or Darcy type, we included
   slip flow and Knudsen diffusion in our network model to simulate gas
   flow in shale systems that contain pores on both micrometer and
   nanometer scales. This is the first network model in 3D that combines
   pores with nanometer and micrometer sizes with different flow physics
   mechanisms on both scales. Our results showed that estimated apparent
   permeability is significantly higher when the additional physical
   phenomena are considered, especially at lower pressures and in networks
   where nanopores dominate. We performed sensitivity analyses on three
   different network models with equal porosity; constant cross-section
   model (CCM), enlarged cross-section model (ECM) and shrunk length model
   (SLM). For the porous systems with variable pore sizes, the apparent
   permeability is highly dependent on the fraction of nanopores and the
   pores' connectivity. The overall permeability in each model decreased as
   the fraction of nanopores increased.}},

Title = {{An asymptotic analysis of drug delivery from transdermal patches}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{442}},
Pages = {{27-30}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Many transdermal drug delivery patches are designed to provide a
   constant steady-state delivery rate, regulated by a rate controlling
   membrane, for a certain period of time. An adhesive layer is needed to
   attach the patch intimately to the skin; this layer is generally
   designed to have little effect on the steady-state release rate. During
   storage all layers within these patches become saturated with drug, and
   as a result the delivery profile involves a sizable ``burst{''} of drug
   prior to reaching a constant delivery rate. In this paper, a
   mathematical procedure developed by Frisch was used to derive an
   asymptotic solution to the accumulative amount of drug delivered versus
   time from which one can deduce the amount of drug released in the burst
   but not the kinetic details of this start up. It was shown that the
   adhesive layer can contribute significantly to the amount of burst even
   when its contribution to the steady-state release rate is negligible.

   unconditionally stable-in-energy, second-order time-accurate, and

   discretization and verify the aforementioned properties by adopting the
   method of manufactured solutions and comparing coarse mesh solutions

   capability of the method. Our methodology provides a means of
   constructing unconditionally stable numerical schemes for nonlinear

Abstract = {{We report the iAMOEBA ({''}inexpensive AMOEBA{''}) classical polarizable
   water model. The iAMOEBA model uses a direct approximation to describe
   electronic polarizability, in which the induced dipoles are determined
   directly from the permanent multipole electric fields and do not
   interact with one another. The direct approximation reduces the
   computational cost relative to a fully self-consistent polarizable model
   such as AMOEBA. The model is parameterized using ForceBalance, a
   systematic optimization method that simultaneously utilizes training
   data from experimental measurements and high-level ab initio
   calculations. We show that iAMOEBA is a highly accurate model for water
   in the solid, liquid, and gas phases, with the ability to fully capture
   the effects of electronic polarization and predict a comprehensive set
   of water properties beyond the training data set including the phase
   diagram. The increased accuracy of AMOEBA over the fully polarizable
   AMOEBA model demonstrates ForceBalance as a method that allows the
   researcher to systematically improve empirical models by efficiently
   utilizing the available data.}},

Abstract = {{We present a computational simulation study of non-equilibrium streamer
   discharges in a coaxial electrode and a corona geometry for automotive
   combustion ignition applications. The streamers propagate in combustible
   fuel-air mixtures at high pressures representative of internal
   combustion engine conditions. The study was performed using a
   self-consistent, two-temperature plasma model with finite-rate plasma
   chemical kinetics. Positive high voltage pulses of order tens of kV and
   duration of tens of nanoseconds were applied to the powered inner
   cylindrical electrode which resulted in the formation and propagation of
   a cathode-directed streamer. The resulting spatial and temporal
   production of active radical species such as O, H, and singlet delta
   oxygen is quantified and compared for lean and stoichiometric fuel-air
   mixtures. For the coaxial electrode geometry, the discharge is
   characterized by a primary streamer that bridges the inter-electrode gap
   and a secondary streamer that develops in the wake of the primary
   streamer. Most of the radicals are produced in the secondary streamer.
   For the corona geometry, only the primary streamer is observed and the
   radicals are produced throughout the length of the primary streamer
   column. The stoichiometry of the mixture was observed to have a
   relatively small effect on both the plasma discharge structure and the
   resulting yield of radical species. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Cobalt oxide (CoO) films are grown epitaxially on Si(001) by atomic
   layer deposition (ALD) using a thin (1.6 nm) buffer layer of strontium
   titanate (STO) grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The ALD growth of CoO
   films is done at low temperature (170-180 degrees C), using cobalt
   bis(diisopropylacetamidinate) and water as co-reactants. Reflection
   high-energy electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and cross-sectional
   scanning transmission electron microscopy are performed to characterize
   the crystalline structure of the films. The CoO films are found to be
   crystalline as-deposited even at the low growth temperature with no
   evidence of Co diffusion into Si. The STO-buffered Si (001) is used as a
   template for ALD growth of relatively thicker epitaxial STO and TiO2
   films. Epitaxial and polycrystalline CoO films are then grown by ALD on
   the STO and TiO2 layers, respectively, creating thin-film
   heterostructures for photoelectrochemical testing. Both types of
   heterostructures, CoO/STO/Si and CoO/TiO2/STO/Si, demonstrate water
   photooxidation activity under visible light illumination. In-situ X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy is used to measure the band alignment of the
   two heterojunctions, CoO/STO and CoO/TiO2. The experimental band
   alignment is compared to electronic structure calculations using density
   functional theory. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{While the field of polymer mechanochemistry has traditionally focused on
   the use of mechanical forces to accelerate chemical processes,
   theoretical considerations predict an underexplored alternative: the
   suppression of reactivity through mechanical perturbation. Here, we use
   electronic structure calculations to analyze the mechanical reactivity
   of six mechanophores, or chemical functionalities that respond to
   mechanical stress in a controlled manner. Our computational results
   indicate that appropriately directed tensile forces could attenuate (as
   opposed to facilitate) mechanochemical phenomena. Accompanying
   experimental studies supported the theoretical predictions and
   demonstrated that relatively simple computational models may be used to
   design new classes of mechanically responsive materials. In addition,
   our computational studies and theoretical considerations revealed the
   prevalence of the anti-Hammond (as opposed to Hammond) effect (i.e., the
   increased structural dissimilarity between the reactant and transition
   state upon lowering of the reaction barrier) in the mechanical
   activation of polyatomic molecules.}},

Abstract = {{A SiGe-based n-channel tunnel field-effect transistor design employing a

   effective band-gap (122meV) at the interface is investigated via

   from the density-gradient model. A gate-normal tunneling geometry is
   used to increase tunneling area and reduce subthreshold swing. The
   strain leads to degeneracy breaking among the silicon conduction band
   valleys, reducing the density of states and associated quantum
   capacitance with better gate-to-tunnel barrier coupling. Performance
   evaluation using a figure-of-merit ``I-60,{''} where the drain current
   corresponds to a subthreshold slope of 60 mV/decade, suggests that the

Abstract = {{We use polymer self-consistent field theory to study the physics
   involved in the permeation of charged dendrimer molecules across anionic
   lipid bilayer membranes. We specifically examine the influence of
   dendrimer shape deformations, neutral grafts, and pH conditions on the
   interactions between dendrimers and membranes. Our results indicate that
   the ability of the dendrimer to undergo conformational rearrangements
   plays a crucial role in influencing the interactions between the
   dendrimer and the membrane. At neutral pH, we observe that dendrimers
   with grafted chains are repelled by the anionic bilayers. However,
   decreasing the solution pH to endosomal conditions results in attractive
   dendrimer-membrane interactions under some parametric conditions. We
   observe that dendrimer insertion into the membrane results in a
   decreased value in membrane tension at which rupture occurs and,
   furthermore, that the rupture tension decreases with the addition of
   grafts to the dendrimer. Our results suggest that dendrimers grafted
   with neutral polymers can serve as effective pH sensitive delivery
   vectors.}},

Abstract = {{Coiled coils are important structural motifs formed by two or more
   amphipathic a-helices that twist into a supercoil. These motifs are
   found in a wide range of proteins, including motor proteins and
   structural proteins, that are known to transmit mechanical loads. We
   analyze atomically detailed simulations of coiled-coil cracking under
   load with Milestoning. Milestoning is an approach that captures the main
   features of the process in a network, quantifying kinetics and
   thermodynamics. A 112-residue segment of the beta-myosin S2 domain was
   subjected to constant-magnitude (0-200 pN) and constant-direction
   tensile forces in molecular dynamics simulations. Twenty 20 ns
   straightforward simulations at several load levels revealed that initial
   single-residue cracking events (Psi > 90 degrees) at loads <100 pN were
   accompanied by rapid refolding without either intra- or interhelix
   unfolding propagation. Only initial unfolding events at the highest load
   (200 pN) regularly propagated along and between helices. Analysis of
   hydrophobic interactions and of interhelix hydrogen bonds did not show
   significant variation as a function of load. Unfolding events were
   overwhelmingly located in the vicinity of E929, a charged residue in a
   hydrophobic position of the heptad repeat. Milestoning network analysis

Title = {{The influence of different simplified sliding-block models and input
   parameters on regional predictions of seismic landslides triggered by
   the Northridge earthquake}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{41-54}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Regional seismic landslide hazard maps are based on predictions of
   rigid-sliding-block displacement derived from estimates of earthquake
   ground shaking, topography, geology, and shear strength. The confidence
   in these predictions requires comparisons with field observations of
   landslide occurrence during previous well-documented earthquakes. This
   paper presents a comparison between observed landslides from the 1994
   Northridge, California earthquake and predicted landslides based on
   sliding-block displacement estimates. Seven empirical displacement
   models, each of which uses a different combination of ground-motion
   parameters, are investigated to evaluate which models and associated
   ground-motion parameters best predict seismic landslides. Using best
   estimates of ground shaking and shear-strength properties from the
   Northridge earthquake, sliding displacements are calculated and compared
   with the locations of observed landslides. Only 20-40\% of the observed
   landslides are captured and the total area of predicted landslides is
   much larger than observed. The ability to predict landslide occurrence
   accurately depends less on the displacement model and associated
   ground-motion parameters, and more on the uncertainty in the model
   parameters, particularly the assigned shear-strengths. Because current
   approaches do not take into account the spatial variability of shear
   strength within individual geologic units, the accuracy of the
   predictive models is controlled predominantly by the distribution of
   slope angles within a geologic unit. Assigning overly conservative (low)
   shear-strength values results in a higher percentage of landslides
   accurately identified but also results in a large over-estimation of the
   total landslide area Making more accurate maps of seismic landslide
   hazards will require methods to define intra-formational variations in
   shear strength. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an extension of our general high-order
   curvilinear finite element approach for solving the Euler equations in a
   Lagrangian frame {[}1] to the case of axisymmetric problems. The
   numerical approximation of these equations is important in a number of
   applications of compressible shock hydrodynamics and the reduction of 3D
   problems with axial symmetry to 2D computations provides a significant
   computational advantage. Unlike traditional staggered-grid hydrodynamics
   (SGH) methods, which use the so-called ``area-weighting{''} scheme, we
   formulate our semi-discrete axisymmetric conservation laws directly in
   3D and reduce them to a 2D variational form in a meridian cut of the
   original domain. This approach is a natural extension Of the high-order
   curvilinear finite element framework we have developed for 2D and 3D
   problems in Cartesian geometry, leading to a rescaled momentum
   conservation equation which includes new radial terms in the pressure
   gradient and artificial viscosity forces. We show that this approach
   exactly conserves energy and we demonstrate via computational examples
   that it also excels at preserving symmetry in problems with symmetric
   initial conditions. The results also illustrate that our computational
   method does not produce spurious symmetry breaking near the axis of
   rotation, as is the case with many area-weighted approaches. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A methodology for dynamic analysis of a poroelastic layered half-space

   continued-fraction absorbing boundary conditions (CFABCs) which are
   accurate and effective in modeling wave propagation in various unbounded
   domains are applied in order to represent the infinite extent of the

   an effective approach in the solution of wave-propagation problems is
   utilized. Green functions of a poroelastic layered half-space are
   obtained accurately with the proposed numerical model. The Green
   functions can be applied to various dynamic problems in the half-space

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental aqueous and surface properties of a family of sulfate
   gemini surfactants have been characterized. The critical micelle
   concentrations (cmc) were determined by both electrical conductivity and
   surface tension methods. The cmc values were found to be two orders of
   magnitude lower than those measured for single tail surfactants. The cmc
   values depend primarily on the surfactant tail length, and relatively
   little on the spacer length and solution temperature. The surface
   tension measurements suggest that current family of gemini surfactants
   have higher tendency to spontaneously adsorb at the air-water interface
   and thus are much more efficient in reducing surface tension than
   conventional single-chain surfactants. Thermodynamic calculations of
   Gibbs free energies for micellization and adsorption indicate surface
   adsorption is promoted more than micellization for these sulfate gemini
   surfactants. This type of molecules may therefore be very efficient and
   cost-effective in applications that require ultra-low interfacial
   tensions and high interfacial activities. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Milestoning is an efficient approximation for computing long-time

   the transition path, or the mean transit time, can be measured in
   single-molecule experiments, such as studies of polymers translocating

Abstract = {{The influence of synthesis temperature and time on the length (capacity)
   of the plateau region during first charge in the high-capacity
   lithium-rich layered oxide Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 and on the reversible
   capacity during subsequent charge-discharge cycles has been
   systematically investigated. The samples were synthesized by firing a
   sol-gel precursor obtained at 450 degrees C at various temperatures
   (850-1000 degrees C) for 24 h and at the optimum temperature of 900
   degrees C for 6-72 h. The maximum length of the plateau region during
   the first charge and, consequently the maximum reversible capacity were
   achieved with the sample fired at 900 degrees C for 24 h. In contrast,
   the sample fired at 1000 degrees C for 24 h does not show any plateau
   region. In-depth characterization by X-ray diffraction,
   aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, inductively coupled plasma analysis, and electrochemical
   charge-discharge measurements reveals that the actual lithium content in
   the synthesized samples, compositional inhomogeneities, and the presence
   of a single C2/m phase vs a C2/m + R (3) over barm two-phase mixture
   play a critical role in the length of the plateau region, while particle
   size and surface area play a minor role. The study demonstrates the
   benefits of the formation of a single-phase C2/m solid solution with a
   lithium content of at least 1.16 in order to maximize the discharge
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Ferromagnetism and its evolution in the orthorhombic perovskite system
   Sr1-xCaxRuO3 have been widely believed to correlate with structural
   distortion. The recent development of high-pressure synthesis of the
   Ba-substituted Sr1-yBayRuO3 makes it possible to study ferromagnetism
   over a broader phase diagram, which includes the orthorhombic Imma and
   the cubic phases. However, the chemical substitutions introduce the
   A-site disorder effect on T-c, which complicates determination of the
   relationship between ferromagnetism and structural distortion. By
   clarifying the site disorder effect on T-c in several unique series of
   ruthenates in which the average bond length < A-O > remains the same but
   the bond-length variance varies, we are able to demonstrate a parabolic
   curve of T-c versus mean bond length < A-O >. A much higher T-c similar
   to 177 K than that found in orthorhombic SrRuO3 can be obtained from the
   curve at a bond length < A-O >, which makes the geometric factor t = <
   A-O >/(root 2 < Ru-O >) similar to 1. This result reveals not only that
   the ferromagnetism in the ruthenates is extremely sensitive to the
   lattice strain, but also that it has an important implication for
   exploring the structure-property relationship in a broad range of oxides
   with perovskite or a perovskite-related structure.}},

Abstract = {{We report on ab initio electronic structure simulations of Li2O2, where
   1.6\% of lithium atoms are substituted by silicon. It is demonstrated
   that this leads to the formation of conducting impurity states in the
   band gap of Li2O2. We show that these states originate from the
   antibonding orbitals of the oxygen pairs and are remarkably stable
   against possible polaron formation (upon electron injection). Through
   this polaron preemption mechanism, the proposed compound is expected to
   show significantly higher electronic mobility than stoichiometric Li2O2,
   which could have significant applications in lithium-air batteries. (C)

Title = {{Effect of the thermal quench on aging in spin glasses}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{We probe the effects of different initial conditions on the process of
   aging in spin glasses arising from alternative temperature quenching
   protocols for the canonical and representative Cu:Mn (6 at.\%) dilute
   magnetic alloy. The effects of these changes are observed through the
   decay of the thermoremanent magnetization, M-TRM(t). We find significant
   changes in the initial state as a consequence of the different cooling
   processes, reflected through an effective waiting time, t(w)(eff). The
   effective waiting time shortens as the time spent above the measuring
   temperature in the cooling protocol is reduced, reaching a minimum when
   the temperature is not allowed to rise above the final measurement
   temperature after the initial quench. This behavior is consistent with
   the picture of a rapid temperature dependence of the barrier heights
   separating metastable states.}},

Abstract = {{This work compares material properties of polycationic nanoparticles
   synthesized using the techniques of UV-initiated polymerization or ARGET

   poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA), tert-butyl
   methacrylate (tBMA), and tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) in
   a surfactant-stabilized monomer-in-water emulsion to form cross-linked
   nanoscale hydrogels. ARGET ATRP resulted in a narrower distribution of
   molecular weight for linear analogs of the polycationic nanoparticles.
   In addition, ARGET ATRP formulations showed a sharper glass transition
   than UV-initiated formulations, indicating increased homogeneity. These
   networks could be used as drug delivery carriers or for other nanogel
   applications that would benefit from polycationic nanoparticles with
   high homogeneity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) communication may provide high
   spectral efficiency through the deployment of a very large number of
   antenna elements at the base stations. The gains from massive MIMO
   communication come from the use of multi-user MIMO on the uplink and
   downlink, but with a large excess of antennas at the base station
   compared to the number of served users. Initial work on massive MIMO did
   not fully address several practical issues associated with its
   deployment. This paper considers the impact of channel aging on the
   performance of massive MIMO systems. The effects of channel variation
   are characterized as a function of different system parameters assuming
   a simple model for the channel time variations at the transmitter.
   Channel prediction is proposed to overcome channel aging effects. The
   analytical results on aging show how capacity is lost due to time
   variation in the channel. Numerical results in a multicell network show
   that massive MIMO works even with some channel variation and that
   channel prediction could partially overcome channel aging effects.}},

Abstract = {{3D unstructured grids for heterogeneous and anisotropic compositional
   reservoir simulation in conjunction with an element-based finite-volume
   method (EbFVM) are presented. The approximate equations of the EbFVM
   adopted in this work are obtained from integration of the compositional
   material balance equations directly to each element type. Using this
   approach, the final approximation equations do not impose any limitation
   on the element shape. The methodology used in this work is suitable for
   modeling complex features of reservoirs such as irregular boundaries,
   fractures, faults, inclined and distorted wells. The mesh for 3D
   dimensional domains can be built of hexahedrons, tetrahedrons, pyramids
   and prisms, or a combination of these elements. According to the number
   of vertices, each element is divided into sub-elements and then mass
   balance equations for each component are integrated along each interface
   of the sub-elements. The finite-volume conservation equations are
   assembled from the contribution of all the elements that share a vertex
   creating a cell vertex approach. It is expected that the approach
   employed in this work will have less grid orientation effect than the
   one using Cartesian meshes since more gridblocks are used in the
   approximated equations. The results for several compositional reservoir
   simulation case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of
   the method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gravity-driven multiphase flow in porous media is ubiquitous in the
   geophysical world; the classic case in hydrology is vertical
   infiltration of precipitation into a soil. For homogenous porous media,
   infiltrations are sometimes observed to be stable and laterally uniform,
   but other times are observed to be unstable and produce preferential
   flow paths. Since Saffman and Taylor (1958), researchers have attempted
   to define criteria that determine instability. Saffman and Taylor's
   analysis consisted of two regions of single phase flow, while Parlange
   and Hill (1976) integrated this analysis with the multiphase flow
   equations to provide testable predictions. In the subsequent 40 years,
   great advances have been made determining the complex interactions
   between multiphase flow and instability. Theoretically, the stability of
   the standard multiphase flow equations has been verified, showing the
   necessity of extensions to the multiphase flow equations to describe the
   observed unstable flow. Experimentally, it has been shown that the
   instability is related to a phenomena in 1-D infiltrations called
   saturation or pressure overshoot. In this review, the connection between
   overshoot and instability is detailed, and it is described how models of
   overshoot can simplify the analysis of current and future models of
   instability and multiphase flow.}},

Title = {{A level set method for simulating capillary-controlled displacements at
   the pore scale with nonzero contact angles}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We present a level set method for simulating capillary-controlled
   displacements with nonzero contact angles in porous media. The main
   feature of the method is a level set evolution velocity which is
   different in the pore space and solid phase. This augments the standard
   level set equation with an extra term such that, at steady state, the
   contact angle is enforced in the solid phase, whereas capillary and
   interfacial forces are balanced in the pore space. We employ the method
   to simulate quasistatic drainage and imbibition processes for different
   contact angles in several pore geometries, and to compute capillary
   pressure and fluid/fluid specific interfacial area curves in each case.
   We validate the method by comparing stable fluid configurations computed
   in idealized two-dimensional geometries and three-dimensional (3-D)
   straight tubes with known analytical solutions. Simulations performed in
   a subset of a 3-D sandstone image show that the developed method
   accounts for well-known pore-scale mechanisms such as piston-like
   invasion, Haines jump, interface coalescence, and retraction, swelling
   of wetting films and snap-off. The contact angle is formed by an
   intersection of the fluid/fluid interface and the void/solid boundary.
   Therefore, the solid matrix surrounding the pore space is discretized
   with at least an equal number of grid points as the size of the
   numerical stencil used to approximate the level set derivatives.}},

Title = {{Morph Algorithms on GPUs}},
Journal = {{ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{147-156}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There is growing interest in using GPUs to accelerate graph algorithms
   such as breadth-first search, computing page-ranks, and finding shortest
   paths. However, these algorithms do not modify the graph structure, so
   their implementation is relatively easy compared to general graph
   algorithms like mesh generation and refinement, which morph the
   underlying graph in non-trivial ways by adding and removing nodes and
   edges. We know relatively little about how to implement morph algorithms
   efficiently on GPUs.
   In this paper, we present and study four morph algorithms: (i) a
   computational geometry algorithm called Delaunay Mesh Refinement (DMR),
   (ii) an approximate SAT solver called Survey Propagation (SP), (iii) a
   compiler analysis called Points-to Analysis (PTA), and (iv) Boruvka's
   Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm (MST). Each of these algorithms modifies
   the graph data structure in different ways and thus poses interesting
   challenges.
   We overcome these challenges using algorithmic and GPU-specific
   optimizations. We propose efficient techniques to perform concurrent
   subgraph addition, subgraph deletion, conflict detection and several
   optimizations to improve the scalability of morph algorithms. For an
   input mesh with 10 million triangles, our DMR code achieves an 80x
   speedup over the highly optimized serial Triangle program and a 2.3x
   speedup over a multicore implementation running with 48 threads. Our SP
   code is 3x faster than a multicore implementation with 48 threads on an
   input with 1 million literals. The PTA implementation is able to analyze
   six SPEC 2000 benchmark programs in just 74 milliseconds, achieving a
   geometric mean speedup of 9.3x over a 48-thread multicore version. Our
   MST code is slower than a multicore version with 48 threads for sparse
   graphs but significantly faster for denser graphs.
   This work provides several insights into how other morph algorithms can
   be efficiently implemented on GPUs.}},

Abstract = {{An increasingly used technique for measuring the thermal conductance of
   a nanowire is based on a suspended micro-device with built-in resistance
   thermometers. In the past, the technique has been limited to samples
   with thermal conductance larger than 1 x 10(-9) W/K because of
   temperature fluctuations in the sample environment and the presence of
   background heat transfer through residual gas molecules and radiation
   between the two thermometers. In addition, parasitic heat loss from the
   long supporting beams and asymmetry in the fabricated device results in
   two additional errors, which have been ignored in previous use of this
   method. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive measurement
   approach, where the device asymmetry is determined by conducting thermal
   measurements with two opposite heat flow directions along the nanowire,
   the background heat transfer is eliminated by measuring the differential
   heat transfer signal between the nanowire device and a reference device
   without a nanowire sample, and the parasitic heat loss from the
   supporting beams is obtained by measuring the average temperature rise
   of one of the beams. This technique is demonstrated on a nanofiber
   sample with a thermal conductance of 3.7 x 10(-10) W/K, against a
   background conductance of 8.2 x 10(-10) W/K at 320 K temperature. The
   results reveal the need to reduce the background thermal conductance in
   order to employ the micro-device to measure a nanowire sample with the
   thermal conductance less than 1 x 10(-10) W/K. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Electric double layer capacitors (or supercapacitors) store charges
   through the physisorption of electrolyte ions onto porous carbon
   electrodes. The control over structure and morphology of carbon
   electrode materials is therefore an effective strategy to render them
   high surface area and efficient paths for ion diffusion. Here we
   demonstrate the fabrication of., highly porous graphene-derived carbons
   with hierarchic 1 pore structures in which mesopores are integrated into
   macroporous scaffolds. The macropores were introduced by assembling
   graphene-based hollow spheres, and the mesopores Were derived from the
   chemical activation with potassium hydroxide. The unique
   three-dimensional pore structures in the produced graphene-derived
   carbons give rise to a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area value of up
   to 3290 m(2) g(-1) and provide an efficient pathway for electrolyte ions
   to diffuse into the interior surfaces of bulk electrode particles. These
   carbons exhibit both high gravimetric (174 F g(-1)) and volumetric
   (similar to 100 F cm(-3)) specific capacitance in an ionic liquid
   electrolyte in acetonitrile. The energy density and power density of the
   cell assembled with this carbon electrode are also high, with
   gravimetric values of 74 Wh kg(-1) and 338 kW kg(-1) and volumetric
   values of 44 Wh L-1 and 199 kW L-1, respectively. The supercapacitor
   performance achieved with these graphene-derived carbons is attributed
   to their unique pore structure and makes them potentially promising for
   diverse energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{Combining the power of immunomagnetic assay and microfluidic microchip
   operations, we successfully detected rare CTCs from clinical blood
   samples. The microfluidic system is operated in a flip-flop mode, where
   a computer-controlled rotational holder with an array of microfluidic
   chips inverts the microchannels. We have demonstrated both theoretically
   and experimentally that the direction of red blood cell (RBC)
   sedimentation with regards to the magnetic force required for cell
   separation is important for capture efficiency, throughput, and purity.
   The flip-flop operation reduces the stagnation of RBCs and nonspecific
   binding on the capture surface by alternating the direction of the
   magnetic field with respect to gravity. The developed immunomagnetic
   microchip-based screening system exhibits high capture rates (more than
   90\%) for SkBr3, PC3, and Colo205 cell lines in spiked screening
   experiments and successfully isolates CTCs from patient blood samples.
   The proposed motion controlled microchip-based immunomagnetic system
   shows great promise as a clinical tool for cancer diagnosis and
   prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{The small carrier wavelength at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies
   enables featuring a large number of co-located antennas. This paper
   exploits the potential of large antenna arrays to develop a
   low-complexity directional modulation technique, Antenna Subset
   Modulation (ASM), for point-to-point secure wireless communication. The
   main idea in ASM is to modulate the radiation pattern at the symbol rate
   by driving only a subset of antennas in the array. This results in a
   directional radiation pattern that projects a sharply defined
   constellation in the desired direction and expanded further randomized
   constellation in other directions. Two techniques for implementing ASM
   are proposed. The first technique selects an antenna subset randomly for
   every symbol. While randomly switching antenna subsets does not affect
   the symbol modulation for a desired receiver along the main direction,
   it effectively randomizes the amplitude and phase of the received symbol
   for an eavesdropper along a sidelobe. Using a simplified statistical
   model, an expression for the average uncoded symbol error rate (SER) is
   derived as a function of the observation angle. To overcome the problem
   of large sidelobes in random antenna subset switching, the second
   technique uses an optimized antenna subset selection procedure based on
   simulated annealing to achieve superior performance compared with random
   selection. Numerical comparisons of the SER performance and secrecy
   capacity of the proposed techniques against those of conventional array
   transmission are presented to highlight the potential of ASM.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Electric field (EF) stimulation has been used to cue cell
   growth for tissue engineering applications. In this study, we explore
   the electrical parameters and extracellular mechanisms that elicit
   changes in cell behavior when stimulated through the substrate.
   Approach. Rat Schwann cell morphology was compared when exposed to EF
   through the media or a conductive indium tin oxide substrate. Ionic and
   structural effects were then analyzed on Matrigel and collagen I,
   respectively. Main results. When stimulating through media, cells had
   greater alignment perpendicular to the EF with higher current densities
   (106 mA cm(-2) at 245 mV mm(-1)), and reached maximum alignment within 8
   h. Stimulation through the substrate with EF (up to 110 mV mm(-1)) did
   not affect Schwann cell orientation, however the EF caused extracellular
   matrix (ECM) coatings on substrates to peel away, suggesting EF can
   physically change the ECM. Applying alternating current (ac) 2-1000 Hz
   signals through the media or substrate both caused cells to flatten and
   protrude many processes, without preferential alignment. Matrigel
   exposed to a substrate EF of 10 mV mm(-1) for 2 h had a greater calcium
   concentration near the cathode, but quickly dissipated when the EF was
   removed. Schwann cells seeded 7 d after gels were exposed to substrate
   EF still aligned perpendicular to the EF direction. Microscopy of
   collagen I exposed to substrate EF shows alignment and bundling of
   fibrils. Significance. These findings demonstrate EF exposure can
   control Schwann cell alignment and morphology, change ECM bulk/surface
   architecture, and align ECM structures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes FlashLinQ-a synchronous peer-to-peer wireless
   PHY/MAC network architecture. FlashLinQ leverages the fine-grained
   parallel channel access offered by OFDM and incorporates an analog
   energy-level-based signaling scheme that enables signal-to-interference
   ratio (SIR)-based distributed scheduling. This new signaling mechanism,
   and the concomitant scheduling algorithm, enables efficient
   channel-aware spatial resource allocation, leading to significant gains
   over a CSMA/CA system using RTS/CTS. FlashLinQ is a complete system
   architecture including: 1) timing and frequency synchronization derived
   from cellular spectrum; 2) peer discovery; 3) link management; and 4)
   channel-aware distributed power, data rate, and link scheduling.
   FlashLinQ has been implemented for operation over licensed spectrum on a
   digital signal processor/field-programmable gate array (DSP/FPGA)
   platform. In this paper, we present FlashLinQ performance results
   derived from both measurements and simulations.}},

Title = {{Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point with Overhead Modeling in Heterogeneous
   Cellular Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4025-4037}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) communication is attractive for
   heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) for interference reduction.
   However, previous approaches to CoMP face two major hurdles in HCNs.
   First, they usually ignore the inter-cell overhead messaging delay,
   although it results in an irreducible performance bound. Second, they
   consider the grid or Wyner model for base station locations, which is
   not appropriate for HCN BS locations which are numerous and haphazard.
   Even for conventional macrocell networks without overlaid small cells,
   SINR results are not tractable in the grid model nor accurate in the
   Wyner model. To overcome these hurdles, we develop a novel analytical
   framework which includes the impact of overhead delay for CoMP
   evaluation in HCNs. This framework can be used for a class of CoMP
   schemes without user data sharing. As an example, we apply it to
   downlink CoMP zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF), and see significant
   divergence from previous work. For example, we show that CoMP ZFBF does
   not increase throughput when the overhead channel delay is larger than
   60\% of the channel coherence time. We also find that, in most cases,
   coordinating with only one other cell is nearly optimum for downlink
   CoMP ZFBF.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Bi2Se3 initially emerged as a particularly promising host of topological
   physics. However, in actual materials, several issues have been
   uncovered including strong surface band bending and potential
   fluctuations. To investigate these concerns, we study nominally
   stoichiometric Bi2Se3 using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Here we
   identify two distinct distributions of Bi-Se antisites that act as
   nanometer-scale sensors for the surface band-bending field. To confirm
   this, we examine bulk Cu-doped Bi2Se3 and demonstrate a significantly
   reduced surface band-bending field. In addition, we find that in the
   case of unintentionally doped Bi2Se3, lateral fluctuations of the Dirac
   point can be directly correlated with specific near-surface point
   defects, namely Se vacancies.}},

Abstract = {{In economic decision analyses, continuous uncertainties are often
   represented by discrete probability distributions. In this article, we
   analyze the ability of discretizations based on the 10th, 50th, and 90th
   percentiles to match the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a
   wide range of distributions in the Johnson distribution system. In
   addition, we develop new discretization methods that improve upon
   current practice. Finally, we demonstrate that all of these methods are
   special cases from a continuum of weightings and show under which
   conditions each is most appropriate. Our results provide guidelines for
   the methods' applications and limits to their usefulness.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{753-771}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a bimodal Gaussian density function to
   characterize pore-size distributions in terms of incremental pore volume
   versus logarithmic pore-throat radius. An inverse problem is formulated
   and solved to reconstruct mercury injection capillary pressure curves by
   enforcing a bimodal Gaussian pore-size distribution. The bimodal
   Gaussian model generates six petrophysically interpretable attributes
   which provide a quantitative basis for petrophysical modeling and rock
   typing. Correlations between these attributes and their associated
   petrophysical properties are investigated to verify interpretations. In
   the field case, the correlation coefficient (R (2)) between absolute
   permeability, end-point gas relative permeability and the mean value of
   large pore-throat size mode are 0.93 and 0.715, respectively.
   Correlation (R (2)=0.613) is also observed between critical water
   saturation and pore volume connected by small pore-throat sizes.
   Petrophysical modeling based on the bimodal Gaussian pore-size
   distribution with sufficient core data calibration predicts static and
   dynamic petrophysical properties that are in agreement with laboratory
   core measurements. The quantitative pore-system description underlies a
   new petrophysical rock typing method that combines all relevant
   pore-system attributes. Verification of the method was performed with
   field data from two key wells in the Hugoton carbonate gas field,
   Kansas.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{160-177}},

Abstract = {{A market-clearing model of the uranium and enrichment industries through
   2030 is presented. Built around thorough databases of primary and
   secondary uranium supplies as well as enrichment facilities, the model
   derives market-clearing conditions by locating the intersections between
   the annual supply-and-demand curves for uranium and enrichment services.
   Considering the effects of secondary supplies including highly enriched
   and natural uranium inventories along with depleted uranium enrichment,
   the model solves embedded optimization problems to account for
   trade-offs between uranium and enrichment requirements. The model can
   Worm policy decisions tied to uranium inventory management and sale and
   market effects of purchase and disbursement from a uranium bank. This
   paper documents the methodologies behind the model, describes a
   stochastic implementation to propagate uncertainties, and contrasts its
   forecasts to static projections. Further, it is applied to an
   illustrative reference case featuring moderate (2.6\%/yr) demand growth
   for reactor fuel. The model predicts near-level uranium prices with
   declining separative work unit prices and enrichment tails assays
   through the mid-2020s. This behavior is largely driven by the coming
   online of several new centrifuge enrichment plants and capacity
   expansions at others, which encourages more aggressive tails assays
   while suppressing uranium requirements.}},

   Fluids}},
Journal = {{SPE PRODUCTION \& OPERATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{While several 3D fracturing models exist for incompressible water-based
   fluids, none are able to capture the thermal and compositional effects
   that are important when using energized fluids such as CO2, N-2, LPG,
   and foams. This paper introduces a new 3D, compositional, non-isothermal
   fracturing model. The new model predicts changes in temperature and
   fluid density. These changes are treated on a firm theoretical basis by
   using an energy-balance equation and an equation of state, both in the
   fracture and in the wellbore. The model is capable of handling any
   multicomponent mixture of fluids and chemicals. Changes in phase
   behavior with temperature, pressure, and composition can be modeled.
   A new simulator has been developed based on the compositional model
   presented in this paper. The simulator is validated for traditional
   fluid formulations against known analytical solutions and against a
   well-established commercial fracturing simulator. Results from the new
   simulator are then presented for energized fluids such as CO2 and LPG.
   In particular, the compositional model shows how fluid expansion and
   viscosity reduction impact fracture growth. These effects are not
   captured by traditional fracturing simulators. The compositional tool is
   specifically suited for fracture design in formations in which energized
   fluids constitute a viable alternative to traditional fracturing fluids.}},

Abstract = {{In a similar fashion to estimates shown for Harmonic, Wachspress, and
   Sibson coordinates in Gillette et al. (Adv Comput Math 37(3), 417-439,
   2012), we prove interpolation error estimates for the mean value
   coordinates on convex polygons suitable for standard finite element
   analysis. Our analysis is based on providing a uniform bound on the
   gradient of the mean value functions for all convex polygons of diameter
   one satisfying certain simple geometric restrictions. This work makes
   rigorous an observed practical advantage of the mean value coordinates:
   unlike Wachspress coordinates, the gradients of the mean value
   coordinates do not become large as interior angles of the polygon
   approach pi.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic jet actuators are investigated for rapidly maneuvering
   airfoils that are regulated by a closed-loop control system. To support
   active flow-control simulations performed here, the closed-loop system

   High-frequency sinusoidal pitching simulations with and without
   synthetic jet actuation indicate that the current synthetic jet
   actuators provide bidirectional change in aerodynamic forces during
   rapid maneuvers whose time scales are of the same order as the flow time
   scales. Responses of a wind-tunnel airfoil are well represented in the
   current simulations, which allows us to predict the response of the
   system for dynamic conditions representative of free flight. The control
   system is able to execute rapid free-flight maneuvers. It is observed
   that the controller is responding to small fluctuations caused by vortex
   shedding from the trailing-edge actuators.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial contamination accounts for more than 60\% of the impairments
   included on the 2008 Texas 303(d) List. Many of these bacterial
   impairments are along the Texas Gulf Coast because coastal waters often
   are regulated for oyster harvesting, which have strict water quality
   standards. Under the Clean Water Act, each one of these impaired
   waterbodies requires a total maximum daily load (TMDL) study to be
   performed. A recent, statewide study recommended the development and
   application of simple modeling approaches to address the majority of
   Texas's bacteria TMDLs, including `` ... simple load duration curve, GIS
   {[}geographic information systems], and/or mass balance models.{''} We
   developed the TMDL Balance model in response to this recommendation.
   TMDL Balance is a steady state, mass balance, GIS-based model for
   simulating pollutant loads and concentrations in coastal systems. The
   model uses plug-flow reactor and continuously-stirred tank reactor
   equations to route spatially distributed point and nonpoint source loads
   through a watershed via overland flow, non-tidal flow, and tidal flow,
   decaying the loads via first-order kinetics. In this paper, we explain
   the development of the watershed loading portion of the TMDL Balance
   model, demonstrating the methodology through a case study: computing
   bacterial loads in the Copano Bay watershed of southeast Texas. The
   application highlights an example of distributing bacterial sources
   spatially based on land use data.}},

Abstract = {{Conductance catheters are known to have a nonuniform spatial sensitivity
   due to the distribution of the electric field. The Geselowitz relation
   is applied to murine and multisegment conductance catheters using finite
   element models to determine the spatial sensitivity in a uniform medium
   and simplified left ventricle models. A new formulation is proposed that
   allows determination of the spatial sensitivity to admittance. Analysis
   of FEM numerical modeling results using the Geselowitz relation provides
   a true measure of parallel conductance in simplified left ventricle
   models for assessment of the admittance method and hypertonic saline
   techniques. The spatial sensitivity of blood conductance (G(b)) is
   determined throughout the cardiac cycle. G(b) is converted to volume
   using Wei's equation to determine if the presence of myocardium alters
   the nonlinear relationship through changes to the electric field.
   Results show that muscle conductance (G(m)) from the admittance method
   matches results from the Geselowitz relation and that the relationship
   between G(b) and volume is accurately fit using Wei's equation.
   Single-segment admittance measurements in large animals result in a more
   evenly distributed sensitivity to the LV blood pool. The hypertonic
   saline method overestimates parallel conductance throughout the cardiac
   cycle in both murine and multisegment conductance catheters.}},

Abstract = {{In recent studies, digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have been a
   promising solution for lab-on-a-chip and bio-assay experiments because
   of their flexible application and low fabrication cost. However, the
   reliability problem is an imperative issue to guarantee the valid
   function of DMFBs. The reliability of DMFBs decreases when electrodes
   are excessively actuated, preventing droplets on DMFBs controlled
   successfully. Because the placement for bio-assays in DMFBs is a key
   step in generating corresponding actuating signals, the reliability of
   DMFBs must be considered during biochip placement to avoid excessive
   actuation. Although researchers have proposed several DMFB placement
   algorithms, they have failed to consider the reliability issue. In
   addition, previous algorithms were all based on the simulated-annealing
   (SA) method, which is time consuming and does not guarantee to obtain an
   optimal solution. This paper proposes the first reliability-oriented
   non-SA placement algorithm for DMFBs. This approach considers the
   reliability problem during placement, and uses the 3-D deferred decision
   making (3D-DDM) technique to enumerate only possible placement
   solutions. Large-scale DMFB placement can be synthesized efficiently by
   partitioning the operation sequential graph of bioassays. Experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed technique can achieve
   reliability-oriented placement for DMFBs without excessive actuation in
   each electrode, while optimizing bioassay completion time.}},

Abstract = {{Disregulation of complement activation plays a critical role in numerous
   inflammatory diseases and therefore, inhibition of the complement
   pathway is of great therapeutic interest. In the classical complement
   pathway, immune complexes formed by IgM, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies
   result in the activation of the C1s protease that in turn cleaves C4 and
   then C4-bound-C2 yielding the proteolytic fragments C4b and C2a which
   associate to form a C3 convertase enzyme. We report here the engineering
   of a potent human antibody inhibitor of C1s protease activity. Phage
   panning of a very large synthetic (F-AB) antibody fragment library using
   a truncated version of C1s, comprising the second CCP domain and serine
   protease domain (CCP2-SP) and expressed in insect cells, resulted in the
   isolation of a F-AB that inhibited the catalytic activity of C1s. An
   affinity matured variant of the F-AB format antibody displaying
   subnanomolar K-D for C1s was shown to exhibit >80\% inhibition of C2
   processing at a 5:1 antibody:C1s molar ratio. We show that this
   engineered antibody, D.35, displays potent inhibition of complement
   deposition and lysis of Ramos cells by the anti-CD20 therapeutic
   antibody rituximab relative to the approved, but less-specific, human
   plasma-derived C1-inhibitor (CINRYZE). C1s inhibitory antibodies should
   be useful for delineating the role of the classical pathway in disease
   models and may hold promise as therapeutic agents. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   is the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model. The authors assimilate data

Abstract = {{Coulomb forces between charged close-flying satellites can be used for
   formation control, and constant electric potentials enable static
   equilibria solutions. In this work, open-loop time-varying potential
   functions, which produce periodic, two-craft, Coulomb formation motions
   are demonstrated for the first time. This is done in the rotating
   Hill-Frame, with linearized gravity, and craft position components
   assumed in the form of simple harmonic oscillators. Substitution of the
   oscillatory functions into the dynamics, further constrains these
   functions, and yields necessary potential histories, to produce the
   periodic flow. The assumed position functions, however, are not
   arbitrary, since the dynamical model restricts what oscillatory
   trajectories are allowed. Specifically, a Hill-Frame integral of motion
   is derived, and this is used to show certain candidate periodic
   functions to be inadmissible. The system dynamics are then linearized to
   expose stability properties of the solutions, and it is established that
   asymptotic stability is impossible for all orbit families. Finally, the
   degree of instability in the assumed motions, over free parameter
   ranges, is determined numerically via the Floquet multipliers of the
   associated full-cycle state-transition matrices. (c) 2013 IAA. Published

   were characterized by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction,
   and thermal analysis (DSC and TGA) and the results were contrasted with
   those of the precursor materials. The swelling index of the hydrogels
   decreases when the GMA mass percentage increases. The X-ray diffraction
   patterns show that the hybrid hydrogels are amorphous in contrast to
   chitosan (CTS), which is semi-crystalline. FTIR analysis confirms the
   existence of physical interactions among constituents. Rheological
   properties, , G, and G, were determined as a function of flow allowing
   one to conclude that (CTS-g-GMA)-X behaves as physical hydrogel.
   Additionally, we report viability of fibroblasts when cultured onto the
   synthesized hydrogels. This study shows that these hydrogels support
   cell viability and have potential for use in biomedical engineering

Abstract = {{Ottawa sand specimens premixed with 0, 3, and 5\% bentonite by dry mass
   of sand were tested under undrained static and cyclic loading to
   investigate the effects of bentonite on the static and cyclic shear
   strength of the sand. The results show that allowing the bentonite to
   hydrate within the sand pore space increases the cyclic resistance of
   the sand. For the same skeleton relative density and cyclic stress
   ratio, cyclic tests on specimens with sufficient hydration times showed
   a significant increase in the number of cycles required for liquefaction
   compared with clean sand. When the specimens were allowed an extended
   postconsolidation aging period, the cyclic resistance increased further.
   Resonant column and cyclic triaxial tests showed that this is a result
   of the delay in the generation of excess pore pressure in the presence
   of the bentonite suspension in the pore space. The improvement in cyclic
   behavior does not occur at the expense of the static resistance of the
   soil under working loads because undrained static triaxial tests on
   specimens with bentonite showed only a minor decrease in the
   small-strain internal friction angle compared with the clean sand, while
   the critical-state internal friction angle remained unchanged. To
   address the need to deliver the bentonite suspension in a sand deposit,
   a method for engineering the rheology of concentrated bentonite
   suspensions through the addition of sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) was
   developed. With the addition of 0.5\% SPP by mass of clay, the viscosity
   of concentrated (10\%) bentonite dispersions dropped to a value that
   allowed delivery of the bentonite into the sand matrix through
   permeation. Over time, the bentonite suspension recovered the
   thixotropic properties that ensured its effectiveness in mitigating
   liquefaction. As a result, sand specimens permeated with 10\% bentonite
   suspensions showed a large increase in liquefaction resistance. Changes
   in the rheological properties of the pore fluid with time also explain
   the increase with aging of the cyclic resistance of the sand-bentonite
   specimens.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a coordinated experimental and analytical study
   that investigated the seismic performance of wood-stud construction with
   clay masonry veneer and of RC masonry construction with clay masonry
   veneer designed according to current U.S. building codes. As part of
   this study, two 1-story buildings were tested on a shaking table. Both
   had clay veneer on the outside. One had wood-frame walls for the backing
   and load-resisting system, whereas the other had RC masonry walls. With
   one exception, the behavior of the veneer in the wood-framed building
   was satisfactory up to levels of shaking consistent with the design
   level earthquake. That exception was related to the relatively low
   pullout strength in wet wood of the conventional nails used to attach
   the veneer connectors to the wood-stud wall. On the basis of this study,
   code changes have been implemented to require the use of higher-capacity
   fasteners for such applications. The wood-frame building specimen itself
   did not collapse under levels of shaking consistent with the maximum
   considered earthquake. Behavior of the RC masonry building and the
   veneer on that building was satisfactory up to levels of shaking well in
   excess of the maximum considered earthquake.}},

Title = {{Deep Subsurface cavities in skin utilizing mechanical optical clearing

Journal = {{LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{383-390}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives High precision subsurface ablation can be
   produced in transparent materials using femtosecond laser pulses and
   multiphoton absorption. Light scattering limits application of the same
   technique to most biological tissues. Previously, subsurface ablation
   was demonstrated at superficial depths (50-250 mu m) in highly
   scattering tissues including murine skin and human sclera. We report
   application of mechanical optical clearing to produce deeper subsurface
   femtosecond ablation in rodent skin. Ability to target deeper structures
   in skin using subsurface ablation may allow novel clinical applications
   for dermatological laser surgery.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods Operation of a prototype tissue
   optical clearing device (TOCD) was verified with white light photography
   in ex vivo rodent skin. A focused femtosecond beam transmitted through
   the TOCD and was scanned across rodent skin to produce subsurface
   ablation at increasing focal depths. Histological sections with H\&E
   staining of the laser irradiated rodent skin were examined for
   subsurface ablation features following laser irradiation.
   Results Subsurface cavities were observed as deep as 1.7mm below the
   skin surface in histological tissue sections. Diameter of subsurface
   cavities varied from tens of microns to over 100m. Subsurface cavities
   produced by scanning the focused femtosecond beam were contiguous and
   formed a continuous cut. Mechanical disruption of the overlying tissues
   was not observed.
   Conclusions Mechanical optical clearing can be applied directly to in
   situ rodent skin and produces an optical clearing effect. High precision
   subsurface ablation can be produced at positions substantially deeper
   than previously demonstrated. Future studies may be targeted in in vivo
   human skin to investigate potential clinical applications of subsurface
   femtosecond ablation using mechanical optical clearing. Lasers Surg.

Abstract = {{Correct multigroup cross sections are essential to modeling the physics
   of nuclear reactors. In particular, the presence of resonances leads to
   the well-known self-shielding effect that complicates any procedure for
   obtaining group cross sections. The Bondarenko method for producing
   self-shielded group cross sections is widely used. For heterogeneous
   systems, the approach requires the use of an escape cross section that
   captures the probability that a neutron will leave a cell without
   interaction, and simple approximations are typically used for this
   purpose. Here we provide a concise derivation for how to determine group
   cross sections using the Bondarenko method with an extension to
   multi-region collision probability models. The accuracy of the method is
   demonstrated by comparing group cross sections derived this way with
   those produced by Monte Carlo simulations of thermal and fast spectrum
   reactors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The displacement of oil by anionic surfactant solutions in oil-wet
   horizontal capillary tubes is studied. The position of the oil-water
   interface is recorded with time. The surfactant solution used is a
   mixture of several different surfactants and co-solvents tailored to
   produce ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) for the specific oil used in
   the study. The surfactant solution results in ultra-low IFT at optimum
   salinity and room temperature. Several experimental parameters including
   the capillary tube radius and surfactant solution viscosity are varied
   to study their effect on the interface speed. Two different models are
   used to predict the oil-water interface position with time. In the first
   model, it is assumed that the IFT is constant and ultra-low throughout
   the experiments. The second model involves change of wettability and IFT
   by adsorption of surfactant molecules to the oil-water interface and the
   solid surface. Comparing the predictions to the experimental results, it
   is observed that the second model provides a better match, especially
   for smaller capillary tubes. The model is then used to predict the
   imbibition rate for very small capillary tubes, which have equivalent
   permeability close to oil reservoirs. The results show that the oil
   displacement rate is limited by the rate of diffusion of surfactants to
   the interface.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium ion batteries with significantly higher energy and power density
   desired for new personal electronic devices, electric vehicles, and
   large-scale energy storage, require new materials. This review focuses
   on the replacement of the graphite anode with silicon or germanium. Si
   and Ge both have significantly higher Li storage capacities than
   graphite, but also undergo significant volumetric expansion and
   contraction during lithiation and delithiation. Si and Ge nanomaterials
   can tolerate these mechanical stresses, but solvent decomposition and
   loss of electrical contact with the current collector tend to lead to
   failure. Si and Ge anodes must therefore be formulated with appropriate
   binder, conductive carbon, and stabilizing additives in the electrolyte
   solvent to achieve stable cycling and high capacity, as described
   herein.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable estimates of petrophysical and compositional properties of
   organic shale are critical for detecting perforation zones or candidates
   for hydro-fracturing jobs. Current methods for in situ formation
   evaluation of organic shale largely rely on qualitative responses and
   empirical formulas. Even core measurements can be inconsistent and
   inaccurate when evaluating clay minerals and other grain constituents.
   We implement a recently introduced inversion-based method for
   organic-shale evaluation from conventional well logs. The objective is
   to estimate total porosity, total organic carbon (TOC), and
   volumetric/weight concentrations of mineral/fluid constituents. After
   detecting bed boundaries, the first step of the method is to perform
   separate inversion of individual well logs to estimate bed physical
   properties such as density, neutron migration length, electrical
   conductivity, photoelectric factor (PEF), and thorium, uranium, and
   potassium volumetric/weight concentrations. Next, a multilayer
   petrophysical model specific to organic shale is constructed with an
   initial guess obtained from conventional well-log interpretation or
   X-ray diffraction data; bed physical properties are calculated with the
   initial layer-by-layer values. Final estimates of organic shale
   petrophysical and compositional properties are obtained by progressively
   minimizing the difference between calculated and measured bed
   properties. A unique advantage of this method is the correction of
   shoulder-bed effects on well logs, which are prevalent in shale-gas
   plays. Another advantage is the explicit calculation of accurate
   well-log responses for specific petrophysical, mineral, fluid, and
   kerogen properties based on chemical formulas and volumetric
   concentrations of minerals/kerogen and fluid constituents.
   Examples are described of the successful application of the new
   organic-shale evaluation method in the Haynesville shale-gas formation.
   This formation includes complex solid compositions and thin beds where
   rapid depth variations of mineral/fluid constituents are commonplace.
   Comparison of estimates for total porosity, total water saturation, and
   TOC obtained with (a) commercial software for multimineral analysis, (b)
   our organic-shale evaluation method, and (c) core/X-ray diffraction
   measurements indicates a significant improvement in estimates of total
   porosity and water saturation yielded by our interpretation method. The
   estimated TOC is also in agreement with core laboratory measurements.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new method is proposed that is capable of predicting
   system condition by comparing the similarity of the most recent
   performance signatures with the known degradation patterns available in
   the historical records. For predicting the future performance, the
   similarities of the current performance signatures to each known
   degradation pattern are utilized in an analytically tractable manner to
   slant the prediction distributions toward most similar past degradation
   patterns. The newly proposed method was applied to prediction of sensor
   signatures coming from an industrial plasma enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition (PECVD) tool operating in a major semiconductor manufacturing
   fab. Results showed that the proposed method significantly improves the
   long-term time series prediction accuracy in terms of mean squared
   errors over the traditional autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model
   and additionally showed comparable mean squared prediction errors to
   another recently introduced similarity-based algorithm for long-term
   prediction of non-linear and non-stationary time series. However, the
   analytical structure of the method proposed in this paper enables
   computation of the prediction distributions an order of magnitude
   faster. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shift work that includes a nighttime rotation has become an unavoidable
   attribute of today's 24-h society. The related disruption of the human
   circadian time organization leads in the short-term to an array of
   jet-lag-like symptoms, and in the long-run it may contribute to weight
   gain/obesity, metabolic syndrome/type II diabetes, and cardiovascular
   disease. Epidemiologic studies also suggest increased cancer risk,
   especially for breast cancer, in night and rotating female shift
   workers. If confirmed in more controlled and detailed studies, the
   carcinogenic effect of night and shift work will constitute additional
   serious medical, economic, and social problems for a substantial
   proportion of the working population. Here, we examine the possible
   multiple and interconnected cancer-promoting mechanisms as a consequence
   of shift work, i.e., repeated disruption of the circadian system, pineal
   hormone melatonin suppression by exposure to light at night,
   sleep-deprivation-caused impairment of the immune system, plus metabolic
   changes favoring obesity and generation of proinflammatory reactive
   oxygen species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The influence of shear-induced forces on the microstructure of fresh
   cement pastes was studied. Aggregation and breakage kinetics of the
   paste matrix are highly influenced by the shear history. It was found
   that the kinetics of re-aggregation is relatively slow, and time scale
   for recovery is longer than the time needed for breakdown. When the
   aggregation kinetics dominates, network interactions among particles
   develop and the average floc size increases. When the breakage kinetics
   dominates, network interactions among particles are broken and are
   accompanied by a decrease in the average floc size. The results suggest
   that there is a limiting size to floc growth. Minor additions of clays
   can significantly impact the structural network development and result
   in a more flocculated structure. The flocs produced by the clays were
   highly stable flocs with strong interparticle bonds that were able to
   oppose floc breakage and floc erosion. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   doxorubicin locally in the colon for the treatment of colon cancers.
   Loading levels ranged from 49\% to 64\% and increased with increasing

   five-species air. The DSMC code was written and optimized with shock
   tube simulations in mind, and includes modifications to allow for the
   efficient simulation of a 1D hypersonic shock. The TCE model is used to
   convert Arrhenius-form reaction rate constants into reaction
   cross-sections, after modification to allow accurate modeling of
   reactions with arbitrarily large rates relative to the VHS collision
   rate. The square of the Pearson correlation coefficient was used as the
   measure for sensitivity in the first of the analyses, and the mutual
   information was used as the measure in the second. The quantity of
   interest (QoI) for these analyses was the NO density profile across a 1D
   shock at similar to 8000 m/s (M-infinity approximate to 23). This vector
   QoI was broken into a set of scalar QoIs, each representing the density
   of NO at a specific point downstream of the shock, and sensitivities
   were calculated for each scalar QoI based on both measures of
   sensitivity. Profiles of sensitivity vs. location downstream of the
   shock were then integrated to determine an overall sensitivity for each
   reaction. A weighting function was used in the integration in order to
   emphasize sensitivities in the region of greatest thermal and chemical
   non-equilibrium. Both sensitivity analysis methods agree on the six
   reactions which most strongly affect the density of NO. These six
   reactions are the N-2 dissociation reaction N-2 + N reversible arrow 3N,
   the O-2 dissociation reaction O-2 + O reversible arrow 3O, the NO
   dissociation reactions NO + N reversible arrow 2N + O and NO + O
   reversible arrow N + 2O, and the exchange reactions N-2 + O reversible
   arrow NO + N and NO + O reversible arrow O-2 + N. This analysis lays the
   groundwork for the application of Bayesian statistical methods for the
   calibration of parameters relevant to modeling a hypersonic shock layer
   with the DSMC method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stable dispersions of graphene oxide nanoplatelets were formed in water
   at pH 2-10 even with 5 wt\% NaCl. For these conditions, oil-in-water
   emulsions stabilized with graphene oxide nanoplatelets remained
   partially stable for 1 year. The droplet sizes were as small as similar
   to 1 mu m with a low nanoplatelet concentration of 0.2 wt\%. The
   emulsions were stable even for nanoplatelet concentrations down to 0.001
   wt\%. The stabilities of the emulsions even at high salinity may be
   attributed to the high anion density at the graphene oxide nanoplatelet
   edges which protrude into the water phase. Furthermore, the graphene
   oxide nanoplatelets are shown to adsorb on the surfaces of the oil
   droplets. The conceptual picture of graphene oxide nanoplatelets
   adsorbed to a greater extent on the water side of the oil/water
   interface, along with the high density of anions on their edges, cause
   the oil/water interface to curve about the oil phase, resulting in
   oil-in-water emulsion droplets. The dispersion stability with a very
   small amount of graphene oxide-based stabilizer, offers an intriguing
   opportunity for applications including CO2 sequestration and enhanced
   oil recovery in deep subsurface formations, which generally contain
   high-salinity brines. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Groutability of granular soils using sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) modified
   bentonite suspensions was studied to investigate its applicability in
   permeation grouting. While the relative grain size of the soil and the
   grout has been widely used to evaluate the groutability of granular
   soils with particulate grouts, such criteria do not account for the
   effect of chemical modifications of grouts such as the changes in their
   rheological properties. The modification of grouts may improve the depth
   of its penetration, and thus changing the groutability of the granular
   soils. For such cases, the rheological properties of grouts become
   crucial to evaluate groutability of soils. In this study, the
   rheological properties of bentonite suspensions were measured at various
   bentonite fractions (5\%, 7.5\%, 10\%, and 12\% by total mass of
   suspension) modified with 0\%, 1\%, 2\%, 3\%, and 4\% SPP (by mass of
   dry bentonite), respectively. The small amounts of SPP effectively
   improved the mobility of the concentrated bentonite suspensions allowing
   the evaluation of change in groutability at different rheological
   properties but same concentrations. The modified bentonite suspensions
   were injected into the saturated sand columns prepared at various
   experimental conditions (effective particle size, relative density, and
   fines content) under two different constant pressures (35 and 140 kPa).
   The results showed that the injected pore volumes increased with an
   increase of the apparent viscosity at equilibrium (high shear rates). A
   new groutability criterion for granular soils is proposed based on the
   rheological properties of the suspensions, relative density of the sand,
   relative grain size of the sand and bentonite, and injection pressure.
   The proposed groutability criterion provides a more accurate prediction
   of groutability in granular soils when using modified bentonite
   suspensions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Particle deposits on indoor surfaces can be as complex and diverse as
   the indoor environments in which they exist. Dust loading can range over
   several orders of magnitude, suggesting the existence of different types
   of particle deposits. These deposits can be broadly classified as either
   a monolayer, in which particles are sparsely deposited on a surface, or
   a multilayer, in which particles are deposited on top of one another and
   there is particle-to-particle adhesion and interaction. Particles within
   these diverse structures of settled indoor dust can become airborne
   through a process known as resuspension, which can occur due to airflow
   in ventilation ducts or human activity indoors. The dust loading and
   deposit structure on an indoor surface may have important implications
   for resuspension in the indoor environment. This literature review
   provides a summary of dust loads found on indoor surfaces in field
   studies and classifies each dust load as either a monolayer or
   multilayer particle deposit. The article highlights the unique
   attributes associated with resuspension from both types of particle
   deposits by summarizing key findings of the experimental resuspension
   literature. The fundamental differences in the resuspension process
   between monolayer and multilayer deposits suggest that resuspension may
   vary considerably among the broad spectrum of dust loads found on indoor
   surfaces. Copyright 2013 American Association for Aerosol Research}},

Abstract = {{Resuspension is an important source of indoor particles and the amount
   of dust loading is an important factor in resuspension emission rates.
   Field studies have shown that light to heavy dust loads can be found in
   the indoor environment, on both the surfaces of flooring and ventilation
   ducts. These diverse particle deposits can be broadly classified as
   either a monolayer, in which particles are sparsely deposited on a
   surface, or a multilayer, in which particles are deposited on top of one
   another and there is particle-to-particle adhesion and interaction. This
   experimental wind tunnel study explores the role of the type of particle
   deposit on aerodynamic resuspension from linoleum flooring and
   galvanized sheet metal. Resuspension fractions are reported for both
   monolayer and multilayer deposits exposed to a wide range of air
   velocities. The type of particle deposit is found to strongly influence
   resuspension. In general, the results show that resuspension from
   multilayer deposits can occur at significantly lower velocities compared
   with monolayer deposits. For example, resuspension fractions at an air
   velocity of 5m/s for the canopy layer of multilayer deposits were
   similar to those found for monolayer deposits at 50m/s. Additionally,
   for multilayer deposits, resuspension fractions for the canopy layer
   increased with increasing dust load and negligible resuspension occurred
   along the surface layer. It was found that the relationship between the
   particle deposit height and the viscous sublayer thickness of the
   airflow can help explain the differences in resuspension that were
   observed between the two types of deposits. The impact of the type of
   particle deposit on resuspension may have important implications for
   resuspension in the indoor environment, where a diversity of deposits
   can be found. Copyright 2013 American Association for Aerosol Research}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental forces of adhesion are responsible for the spreading of
   fluids such as crude oil/brine on the reservoir rock surface. These
   physico-chemical interactions determine the surface energetics of a
   reservoir and thus their wetting phenomena. Inverse Gas Chromatography
   (IGC) is introduced to characterize the surface energy of sandstones
   (Ottawa sand and Berea sandstone). The surface chemistry of the
   sandstone rocks is further elucidated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The behavior of the
   polar and non-polar interaction forces was investigated at varying water
   coverage and at different temperatures. The results indicated that in
   general as the water coverage increased, the Lifshitz-van der Waals
   component of surface energy decreased to nearly that of the bulk water,
   while the acid-base component also showed a decreasing trend. The
   Lifshitz-van der Waals component of surface energy always decreased with
   increase in temperature, while the acid-base properties showed
   contrasting trends in line with changes in surface chemistry of the
   sandstones, due to the change in temperature. Finally, the wetting
   properties arising in reservoir sandstones were related to the surface
   chemistry of the reservoir fluids and their interactions with the
   reservoir rock surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a strategic analysis of the network design problem
   faced by pickup and delivery companies operating in metropolitan areas
   and serving two or more classes of customers. The focus is on a division
   that treats commercial and residential customers separately, a situation
   motivated by their respective geographic densities and the size and
   frequency of their demand. In constructing driver work areas, it is
   necessary to take into account expected demand, vehicle capacity, time
   on the road, and the aspect ratio of the individual territories. This
   leads to a capacitated clustering problem with side constraints that has
   been the subject of intense research over the last decade.
   Based on a previously developed column generation algorithm, a case
   study was conducted involving several scenarios that integrate the two
   networks to determine the extent of the resulting benefits. To no
   surprise, the analysis showed that a significant reduction in fleet size
   can be achieved when the two networks are either partially or fully
   combined. It also showed that small reductions with respect to current
   practice are possible when they are separately maintained with the added
   benefit that the geometry of the resultant clusters satisfies certain
   desirable properties with respect to their contours and aspect ratios.

Abstract = {{Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is a promising photoelectrode material for the
   oxidation of water, but fundamental studies of this material are
   lacking. To address this, we report electrical and photoelectrochemical
   (PEC) properties of BiVO4 single crystals (undoped, 0.6\% Mo, and 0.3\%
   W:BiVO4) grown using the floating zone technique. We demonstrate that a
   small polaron hopping conduction mechanism dominates from 250 to 400 K,
   undergoing a transition to a variable-range hopping mechanism at lower
   temperatures. An anisotropy ratio of similar to 3 was observed along the
   c axis, attributed to the layered structure of BiVO4. Measurements of
   the ac field Hall effect yielded an electron mobility of similar to 0.2
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for Mo and W:BiVO4 at 300 K. By application of the
   Gartner model, a hole diffusion length of similar to 100 nm was
   estimated. As a result of low carrier mobility, attempts to measure the
   dc Hall effect were unsuccessful. Analyses of the Raman spectra showed
   that Mo and W substituted for V and acted as donor impurities.
   Mott-Schottky analysis of electrodes with the (001) face exposed yielded
   a flat band potential of 0.03-0.08 V versus the reversible H-2
   electrode, while incident photon conversion efficiency tests showed that
   the dark coloration of the doped single crystals did not result in
   additional photocurrent. Comparison of these intrinsic properties to
   those of other metal oxides for PEC applications gives valuable insight
   into this material as a photoanode.}},

Funding-Text = {{These findings may have important applications in noise control,
   sensing, cloaking, sound energy harvesting and nonlinearity enhancement.
   The extraordinary squeezing capabilities of DNZ ultranarrow channels may
   be exploited to boost nonlinearities for sensing, switches and
   parametric amplifiers. Ultranarrow DNZ channels, obtained by simply
   loading a capillary tube with membranes, may be used to drastically
   change the boundary conditions of an acoustic cavity, with interesting
   applications in modal noise control of rooms. The membranes could be
   also replaced by active transducers to create self-tunable energy
   harvesters or dissipaters. Finally, we believe that the capability of
   bent DNZ channels to deviate the flow of acoustic energy could be
   exploited in cloaking applications and in noise control. This work has

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{The curvature of a liquid vapor interface has long been known to change
   the equilibrium vapor pressure. It has also been shown that a capillary
   structure will affect the temperature at which both freezing and
   vaporization of a substance will occur. However, describing interfacial
   effects on the latent heat of a phase change has proven more difficult.
   Here, we present a classical thermodynamic model for how the latent heat
   of melting changes as the size of the particles undergoing the
   transition decreases. The scale dependence for the surface tension is
   taken into consideration using a Tolman length correction. The resulting
   model is tested by fitting to published experimental data for the latent
   heat of melting for benzene, heptane, naphthalene, and water contained
   in nanoporous glass. In all cases the model fits the data with a R-2 >=

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{We have studied the pressure dependence of the superconducting
   transition temperature T-c of the filled skutterudite YFe4P12 under
   various quasihydrostatic pressures up to 8 GPa. DC magnetization
   measurements up to 1.2 GPa in a piston-cylinder cell yields a linear
   increase of T-c with a positive coefficient dT(c)/dP = 1 K/GPa.
   Resistivity measurements up to 8 GPa in a cubic anvil apparatus show
   that Tc increases to 9.3 K at 8 GPa, but the slope decreases gradually
   with increasing pressure. Besides the previously reported LaFe4P12,
   YFe4P12 becomes the second filled skutterudite superconductor that
   exhibits a positive pressure coefficient dT(c)/dP in a broad pressure
   range. The observed large dT(c)/dP > 0 of YFe4P12 can be rationalized by
   our band-structure calculations that show an enhancement of density of
   states at Fermi energy and the Hopfield parameter under pressure at
   least up to 8 GPa. On the other hand, similar calculations predict a
   dT(c)/dP < 0 for YRu4P12.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve consistent electrochemical properties essential for

   a deeper fundamental understanding of the factors contributing to

   elucidated. We present here a comparison of stoichiometric
   LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 cathodes with a 3:1 Mn/Ni ratio prepared by different
   methods with varying morphologies and degrees of cation ordering.
   Careful structural, chemical, and electrochemical characterizations
   illuminate the relative influence of the various factors on the
   electrochemical cycling stability and high-rate performance. It is found
   that although an increase in the degree of cation ordering decreases the
   rate capability, the crystallographic planes in contact with the
   electrolyte have a dominant effect on the electrochemical properties.}},

Abstract = {{The physical properties of Sr14-xCaxCu24O41 are determined by the hole
   distribution between the edge-shared CuO2 chain and the corner-shared
   Cu2O3 two-leg ladder, but inconsistent results on the hole distribution
   were obtained in various experimental works in recent decades. In this
   work we reinvestigate the hole distribution by soft x-ray absorption
   spectroscopy at the Cu L-3 edge. By comparing with the pure ladder and
   the pure chain systems, we can unambiguously distinguish between the
   hole distributions in the chain and the ladder. We have found that there
   are 5.3 holes in the edge-shared chain and 0.7 holes in the
   corner-shared ladder on average for Sr14Cu24O41. Upon Ca substitution,
   the holes gradually transfer from the edge-shared chain to the
   corner-shared ladder, and there are up to 1.21 holes in the
   corner-shared ladder for Sr1.8Ca12.2Cu24O41.}},

Title = {{A nonlinear negative stiffness metamaterial unit cell and small-on-large
   multiscale material model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{A persistent challenge in the design of composite materials is the
   ability to fabricate materials that simultaneously display high
   stiffness and high loss factors for the creation of structural elements
   capable of passively suppressing vibro-acoustic energy. Relevant recent
   research has shown that it is possible to produce composite materials
   whose macroscopic mechanical stiffness and loss properties surpass those
   of conventional composites through the addition of trace amounts of
   materials displaying negative stiffness (NS) induced by phase
   transformation {[}R. S. Lakes et al., Nature 410, 565-567 (2001)]. The
   present work investigates the ability to elicit NS behavior without
   employing physical phenomena such as inherent nonlinear material
   behavior (e.g., phase change or plastic deformation) or dynamic effects,
   but rather the controlled buckling of small-scale structural elements,
   metamaterials, embedded in a continuous viscoelastic matrix. To
   illustrate the effect of these buckled elements, a nonlinear
   hierarchical multiscale material model is derived, which estimates the
   macroscopic stiffness and loss of a composite material containing
   pre-strained microscale structured inclusions. The multiscale model
   consists of two scale transition models, the first being an energy-based
   nonlinear finite element (FE) method to determine the tangent modulus of
   the metamaterial unit cell, and the other a classical analytical
   micromechanical model to determine the effective stiffness and loss
   tensors of a heterogeneous material for small perturbations from the
   local strain state of the unit cells. The FE method enables the
   estimation of an effective nonlinear anisotropic stiffness tensor of a
   buckled microstructure that produces NS and is sufficiently general to
   consider geometries different from those given in this work. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The ambient gas effect in SiOx-based resistive switching memory has been
   studied. After the electroforming process, resistive switching behavior
   functions in vacuum as well as in nitrogen without dramatic degradation.
   However, introducing an oxygen-nitrogen ambient suppresses resistive
   switching behavior at pressures above 1 Torr. Resistive switching is
   fully reestablished in oxygen-exposed devices after a vacuum recovery
   step. The failure phenomena can be described by Monte Carlo simulation
   using bi-modal statistics to enable feature distribution modeling of
   failure modes. Design criteria and guidelines are identified for
   packaging of future oxygen-sensor and of nonvolatile memory
   applications. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Li6Zr2O7 crystallizes in a framework structure with Li occupying 1D

   Insertion of x=0.15 Li in the form of Li6+xZr2-xMxO7 can be obtained by
   simple solid state synthesis. In order to know the limit of Li insertion

   Li6+xZr1.5Ti0.5O7 of excess Li to at least x approximate to 0.17 at room

Abstract = {{The ability to site-specifically incorporate unnatural amino acids
   (UAAs) into proteins is a powerful tool in protein engineering. While
   dozens of UAAs have been successfully introduced into proteins expressed
   by Escherichia coli cells, it has been much more challenging to create
   tRNA and tRNA-Synthetase pairs that enable UAAs incorporation, for use
   in mammalian systems. By altering the orthogonality properties of
   existing unnatural pairs, previously evolved pairs for use in E. coli
   could be used in mammalian cells. This would bypass the cumbersome step
   of having to evolve mutant synthetases and would allow for the rapid
   development of new mammalian pairs. A major limitation to the amount of
   UAA-containing proteins that can be expressed in the cell is the
   availability of UAA-charged orthogonal suppressor tRNA. By using a
   natural mammalian tRNA promoter, the amount of functional suppressor
   tRNA can be greatly increased. Furthermore, increasing recognition of
   the suppressor tRNA by the mutant synthetase will ultimately lead to the
   appearance of more UAA-charged tRNA.}},

Abstract = {{Oxide ion electrolytes determine the temperature of operation of solid
   oxide fuel cells, oxygen separation membranes, and oxygen sensors. There
   is a strong incentive to lower their operating temperatures, in a solid
   oxide fuel cell, for example, from T-op > 800 degrees C to T-op
   approximate to 500 degrees C. The use of low-cost Na+ rather than K+ as
   the dopant in monoclinic SrSiO3 (C12/C1) is shown to provide a larger
   solid solution range (0 < x <= 0.45) in Sr1-xNaxSiO3-0.5x and to achieve
   an oxide ion conductivity sigma(o) >= 10(-2) S.cm(-1) by 525 degrees C
   as a result of lowering the temperature of a smooth transition to full
   disorder of the mobile oxide ions. The Sr1-xNaxSiO3-0.5x electrolytes
   are much less hygroscopic than Sr1-xNaxSiO3-0.5x and are stable with a
   nickel composite anode in 5\% H-2/Ar as well as with cathodes such as
   La1-xSrxMnO3-delta and Sr0.7Y0.3CoO3-delta in air, which makes them
   candidate electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel

Abstract = {{We present the synthesis and characterization of a series of
   pH-responsive hydrogel nanoparticles based on crosslinked
   2-(diethylaminoethyl) methacrylate and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl
   ether methacrylate (P(DEAEMA-g-PEGMA)). Variants of this polymer were
   created using t-butyl methacrylate (P(DEAEMA-co-TBMA-g-PEGMA)) or
   t-butylaminoethyl methacrylate (P(DEAEMA-co-TBAEMA-g-PEGMA)). The
   synthesis of these materials was accomplished using a facile
   photoemulsion polymerization. Polymer composition was verified using H-1
   NMR spectroscopy and closely approximates the copolymer composition
   estimated from reactivity ratios. Particle formulations possess a dry
   diameter of 50-65 nm as determined by transmission electron microscopy
   and collapsed hydrodynamic diameter of 70-100 nm as determined by
   dynamic light scattering. Dynamic light scattering and pyrene
   fluorescence spectroscopy were used to probe the pH-dependent phase
   transition in the hydrogel nanoparticles from collapsed hydrophobe to
   swollen hydrophile. The inclusion of t-butyl methacrylate served to
   depress the nanogel pKa and critical pH for phase transition to <6.9
   while the inclusion of t-butylamino methacrylate had the opposite
   effect. We show that these hydrogel nanoparticles possess tunable
   physicochemical properties that can be adjusted by changing copolymer
   composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the decisive role in suppressing ferroelectricity in these cases. We use

Abstract = {{Aromatic random copolyimides were synthesized and tested as membrane
   materials for the separation of a mixture of aromatic and aliphatic

   two-step polycondensation route with a total of 4 aromatic dianhydrides,
   4 aromatic diamines, and 3 diamino-terminated aliphatic oligomers
   containing either ether or siloxane units. Pervaporation experiments
   were conducted at two temperatures with toluene/n-heptane and
   benzene/n-heptane mixtures as feed streams. All polymers were selective
   toward the aromatic hydrocarbon. Introduction of siloxane units in the
   polymer generally led to very high hydrocarbon permeability
   coefficients, but caused a reduction in selectivity relative to that of
   the aromatic homopolyimide. Incorporation of ether units, on the other
   hand, did not generally cause such large increases in permeability, nor
   large decreases in selectivity. The performance of these materials was
   compared with previous results reported in the literature for other

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Strain gauges are widely applied to measure mechanical deformation of
   structures and specimens. While metallic foil gauges usually have a
   gauge factor slightly over 2, single crystalline silicon demonstrates
   intrinsic gauge factors as high as 200. Although silicon is an
   intrinsically stiff and brittle material, flexible and even stretchable
   strain gauges have been achieved by integrating thin silicon strips on
   soft and deformable polymer substrates. To achieve a fundamental
   understanding of the large variance in gauge factor and stretchability
   of reported flexible/stretchable silicon-on-polymer strain gauges,
   finite element and analytically models are established to reveal the
   effects of the length of the silicon strip, and the thickness and
   modulus of the polymer substrate. Analytical results for two limiting
   cases, i.e., infinitely thick substrate and infinitely long strip, have
   found good agreement with FEM results. We have discovered that strains
   in silicon resistor can vary by orders of magnitude with different
   substrate materials whereas strip length or substrate thickness only
   affects the strain level mildly. While the average strain in silicon
   reflects the gauge factor, the maximum strain in silicon governs the
   stretchability of the system. The tradeoff between gauge factor and
   stretchability of silicon-on-polymer strain gauges has been proposed and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Pressurized graphene bubbles have been observed in experiments, which
   can be used to determine the mechanical and adhesive properties of
   graphene. A nonlinear plate theory is adapted to describe the
   deformation of a graphene monolayer subject to lateral loads, where the
   bending moduli of monolayer graphene are independent of the in-plane
   Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. A numerical method is developed to
   solve the nonlinear equations for circular graphene bubbles, and the
   results are compared to approximate solutions by analytical methods.
   Molecular dynamics simulations of nanoscale graphene bubbles are
   performed, and it is found that the continuum plate theory is suitable
   only within the limit of linear elasticity. Moreover, the effect of van
   der Waals interactions between graphene and its underlying substrate is
   analyzed, including large-scale interaction for nanoscale graphene
   bubbles subject to relatively low pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Delineating the normal postnatal development of the pulmonary artery
   (PA) and ascending aorta (AA) can inform our understanding of congenital
   abnormalities, as well as pulmonary and systolic hypertension. We thus
   conducted the following study to delineate the PA and AA postnatal
   growth deformation characteristics in an ovine model. MR images were
   obtained from endoluminal surfaces of 11 animals whose ages ranged from
   1.5 months/15.3 kg mass (very young) to 12 months/56.6 kg mass (adult).
   A bicubic Hermite finite element surface representation was developed
   for the each artery from each animal. Under the assumption that the
   relative locations of surface points were retained during growth, the
   individual animal surface fits were subsequently used to develop a
   method to estimate the time-evolving local effective surface growth
   (relative to the youngest measured animal) in the end-diastolic state.
   Results indicated that the spatial and temporal surface growth
   deformation patterns of both arteries, especially in the circumferential
   direction, were heterogeneous, leading to an increase in taper and
   increase in cross-sectional ellipticity of the PA. The longitudinal PA
   growth stretch of a large segment on the posterior wall reached 2.57 +/-
   0.078 (mean +/- SD) at the adult stage. In contrast, the longitudinal
   growth of the AA was smaller and more uniform (1.80 +/- 0.047).
   Interestingly, a region of the medial wall of both arteries where both
   arteries are in contact showed smaller circumferential growth
   stretches-specifically 1.12 +/- 0.012 in the PA and 1.43 +/- 0.071 in
   the AA at the adult stage. Overall, our results indicated that contact
   between the PA and AA resulted in increasing spatial heterogeneity in
   postnatal growth, with the PA demonstrating the greatest changes.
   Parametric studies using simplified geometric models of curved arteries
   during growth suggest that heterogeneous effective surface growth
   deformations must occur to account for the changes in measured arterial
   shapes during the postnatal growth period. This result suggests that
   these first results are a reasonable first-approximation to the actual
   effective growth patterns. Moreover, this study clearly underscores how
   functional growth of the PA and AA during postnatal maturation involves
   complex, local adaptations in tissue formation. Moreover, the present
   results will help to lay the basis for functional replacement by
   defining critical geometric metrics.}},

Abstract = {{The Lower Mississippi River protrudes into the Gulf of Mexico, and
   manmade levees line only the west bank for 55 km of the Lower
   Plaquemines section. Historically, sustained easterly winds from
   hurricanes have directed surge across Breton Sound, into the Mississippi
   River and against its west bank levee, allowing for surge to build and
   then propagate efficiently upriver and thus increase water levels past
   New Orleans. This case study applies a new and extensively validated
   basin- to channel-scale, high-resolution, unstructured-mesh ADvanced
   CIRCulation model to simulate a suite of historical and hypothetical
   storms under low to high river discharges. The results show that during
   hurricanes, (1) total water levels in the lower river south of Pointe a
   La Hache are only weakly dependent on river flow, and easterly
   wind-driven storm surge is generated on top of existing ambient strongly
   flow-dependent river stages, so the surge that propagates upriver
   reduces with increasing river flow; (2) natural levees and adjacent
   wetlands on the east and west banks in the Lower Plaquemines capture
   storm surge in the river, although not as effectively as the manmade
   levees on the west bank; and (3) the lowering of manmade levees along
   this Lower Plaquemines river section to their natural state, to allow
   storm surge to partially pass across the Mississippi River, will
   decrease storm surge upriver by 1 to 2 m between Pointe a La Hache and
   New Orleans, independent of river flow. (C) 2013 American Society of

Abstract = {{Selection markers are common genetic elements used in recombinant cell
   line development. While several selection systems exist for use in
   mammalian cell lines, no previous study has comprehensively evaluated
   their performance in the isolation of recombinant populations and cell
   lines. Here we examine four antibiotics, hygromycin B, neomycin,
   puromycin, and Zeocin, and their corresponding selector genes, using a
   green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter in two model cell lines,
   HT1080 and HEK293. We identify Zeocin as the best selection agent for
   cell line development in human cells. In comparison to the other
   selection systems, Zeocin is able to identify populations with higher
   fluorescence levels, which in turn leads to the isolation of better
   clonal populations and less false positives. Furthermore,
   Zeocin-resistant populations exhibit better transgene stability in the
   absence of selection pressure compared to other selection agents. All
   isolated Zeocin-resistant clones, regardless of cell type, exhibited GFP
   expression. By comparison, only 79\% of hygromycin B-resistant, 47\% of
   neomycin-resistant, and 14\% of puromycin-resistant clones expressed
   GFP. Based on these results, we rank Zeocin > hygromycin B approximate
   to puromycin > neomycin for cell line development in human cells.
   Furthermore, this study demonstrates that selection marker choice does
   indeed impact cell line development.}},

Title = {{The system-wide economics of a carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and
   storage network: Texas Gulf Coast with pure CO2-EOR flood}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{This letter compares several bounding cases for understanding the
   economic viability of capturing large quantities of anthropogenic CO2
   from coal-fired power generators within the Electric Reliability Council
   of Texas electric grid and using it for pure CO2 enhanced oil recovery
   (EOR) in the onshore coastal region of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico.
   All captured CO2 in excess of that needed for EOR is sequestered in
   saline formations at the same geographic locations as the oil reservoirs
   but at a different depth. We analyze the extraction of oil from the same
   set of ten reservoirs within 20- and five-year time frames to describe
   how the scale of the carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage
   (CCUS) network changes to meet the rate of CO2 demand for oil recovery.
   Our analysis shows that there is a negative system-wide net present
   value (NPV) for all modeled scenarios. The system comes close to
   breakeven economics when capturing CO2 from three coal-fired power
   plants to produce oil via CO2-EOR over 20 years and assuming no CO2
   emissions penalty. The NPV drops when we consider a larger network to
   produce oil more quickly (21 coal-fired generators with CO2 capture to
   produce 80\% of the oil within five years). Upon applying a CO2
   emissions penalty of 60\$2009/tCO(2) to fossil fuel emissions to ensure
   that coal-fired power plants with CO2 capture remain in baseload
   operation, the system economics drop significantly. We show near
   profitability for the cash flow of the EOR operations only; however,
   this situation requires relatively cheap electricity prices during
   operation.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility, cost, and air quality impacts of using electrical grids

   generation. During a 2006 drought, shifting electricity generation out
   of the most impacted areas of South Texas (similar to 10\% of base case
   generation) to other parts of the grid would have been feasible using
   transmission and power generation available at the time, and some areas
   would experience changes in air quality. Although expensive,
   drought-based electricity dispatch is a potential parallel strategy that

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the literature on spatial filtering (SF) for
   analysis of spatial data. Given the scarcity of its application in
   transportation and its fledgling nature, preliminary case studies were
   conducted using continuous and discrete response data sets, for land
   values and land use, in comparison with results from spatial
   autoregressive (SAR) models with distance decay parameters estimated
   using Bayesian techniques. For both the continuous land value and binary
   land use cases, the SF approach demonstrates great potential as a worthy
   competitor to more conventional SAR-based models. In addition to
   offering high fit statistics, somewhat shorter computing times, and more
   straightforward computations, the SF approach makes explicit the
   patterns of spatial dependency in the land value and land use data. By
   controlling for these spatial relationships, the SF approach yields more
   reliable marginal effects of policy variables of interest. Model results
   confirm the important role of transportation access (as quantified using
   distances to a region's central business district, and various roadway
   types). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The influence of merged muscle excitation modules on post-stroke
   hemiparetic walking performance}},

Abstract = {{Background: Post-stroke subjects with hemiparesis typically utilize a
   reduced number of modules or co-excited muscles compared to non-impaired
   controls, with at least one module resembling the merging of two or more
   non-impaired modules. In non-impaired walking, each module has distinct
   contributions to important biomechanical functions, and thus different
   merged module combinations post-stroke may result in different
   functional consequences.
   Methods: Three-dimensional forward dynamics simulations were developed
   for non-impaired controls and two groups of post-stroke hemiparetic
   subjects with different merged module combinations to analyze how
   paretic leg muscle contributions to body support, forward propulsion,
   mediolateral control and leg swing are altered.
   Findings: The potential of the plantarflexors to generate propulsion was
   impaired in both hemiparetic groups while the remaining functional
   consequences differed depending on which modules were merged. Paretic
   leg swing was impaired during pre-swing when Modules 1 (hip abductors
   and knee extensors during early stance), and 2 (plantarflexors during
   late stance) were merged and during late swing when Modules 1 and 4
   (hamstrings during late swing into early stance) were merged. When
   Modules 1 and 4 were merged, body support during early stance was also
   impaired.
   Interpretation: These results suggest that improving plantarflexor
   ability to generate propulsion is critical during rehabilitation
   regardless of module composition. If Modules 1 and 2 are merged, then
   rehabilitation should also focus on improving paretic leg pre-swing
   whereas if Modules 1 and 4 are merged, then rehabilitation should also
   focus on improving early stance body support and late paretic leg swing.

Abstract = {{One of the major concerns with nanoimprint lithography is defectivity.
   One source of process-specific defects is associated with template
   separation failure. The addition of fluorinated surfactants to the
   imprint resist is an effective way to improve separation and template
   lifetime. This study focuses on the development of new reactive
   fluorinated additives, which function as surfactants and also have the
   ability to chemically modify the template surface during the imprint
   process and thereby sustain a low surface energy release layer on the
   template. Material screening indicated that the silazane functional
   group is well suited for this role. The new reactive surfactant,
   di-(3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8-tridecafluorooctyl)silazane (F-silazane)
   was synthesized and tested for this purpose. The material has sufficient
   reactivity to functionalize the template surface and acceptable
   stability (and thus shelf-life) in the imprint formulation. Addition of
   F-silazane to a standard imprint resist formulation significantly
   improved template release performance and allowed for significantly
   longer continuous imprinting than the control formulation. A
   multiple-imprint study using an Imprio (R) 100 tool confirmed the
   effectiveness of this new additive. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE

Title = {{The influence of locomotor rehabilitation on module quality and

Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{511-517}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have suggested the biomechanical subtasks of walking can
   be produced by a reduced set of co-excited muscles or modules.
   Individuals post-stroke often exhibit poor inter-muscular coordination
   characterized by poor timing and merging of modules that are normally
   independent in healthy individuals. However, whether locomotor therapy
   can influence module composition and timing and whether these
   improvements lead to improved walking performance is unclear. The goal
   of this study was to examine the influence of a locomotor rehabilitation
   therapy on module composition and timing and post-stroke hemiparetic
   walking performance.
   Twenty-seven post-stroke hemiparetic subjects participated in a 12-week
   locomotor intervention incorporating treadmill training with body weight
   support and manual trainers accompanied by training overground walking.
   Electromyography (EMG), kinematic and ground reaction force data were
   collected from subjects both pre- and post-therapy and from 19
   age-matched healthy controls walking on an instrumented treadmill at
   their self-selected speed. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to
   identify the module composition and timing from the EMG data. Module
   timing and composition, and various measures of walking performance were
   compared pre- and post-therapy.
   In subjects with four modules pre- and post-therapy, locomotor training
   resulted in improved timing of the ankle plantarflexor module and a more
   extended paretic leg angle that allowed the subjects to walk faster and
   with more symmetrical propulsion. In addition, subjects with three
   modules pre-therapy increased their number of modules and improved
   walking performance post-therapy. Thus, locomotor training has the
   potential to influence module composition and timing, which can lead to
   improvements walking performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The automobile industry consumed 9 million metric tons of lead in 2012
   for lead-acid batteries. Recycling lead from spent lead-acid batteries
   is not only related to the sustainable development of the lead industry,
   but also to the reduction of lead pollution in the environment. The
   existing lead pyrometallurgical processes have two main issues, toxic
   lead emission into the environment and high energy consumption; the
   developing hydrometallurgical processes have the disadvantages of high
   electricity consumption, use of toxic chemicals and severe corrosion of
   metallic components. Here we demonstrate a new green hydrometallurgical
   process to recover lead based on a hydrogen-lead oxide fuel cell.
   High-purity lead, along with electricity, is produced with only water as
   the by-product. It has a >99.5\% lead yield, which is higher than that
   of the existing pyrometallurgical processes (95-97\%). This greatly
   reduces lead pollution to the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale integration of vanadium dioxide (VO2) on mechanically
   flexible substrates is critical to the realization of flexible smart
   window films that can respond to environmental temperatures to modulate
   light transmittance. Until now, the formation of highly crystalline and
   stoichiometric VO2 on flexible substrate has not been demonstrated due
   to the high-temperature condition for VO2 growth. Here, we demonstrate a
   VO2-based thermochromic film with unprecedented mechanical flexibility
   by employing graphene as a versatile platform for VO2. The graphene
   effectively functions as an atomically thin, flexible, yet robust
   support which enables the formation of stoichiometric VO2 crystals with
   temperature-driven phase transition characteristics. The
   graphene-supported VO2 was capable of being transferred to a plastic
   substrate, forming a new type of flexible thermochromk film. The
   flexible VO2 films were then integrated into the mock-up house,
   exhibiting its efficient operation to reduce the in-house temperature
   under infrared irradiation. These results provide important progress for
   the fabrication of flexible thermochromic films for energy-saving
   windows.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoporous nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) thin film was grown on the

   The resulting free-standing Ni(OH)(2)/UGf composite was used as the

   binder or metal-based current collector. The highly conductive 3D UGF
   network facilitates electron transport and the porous Ni(OH)(2) thin
   film structure shortens ion diffusion paths and facilitates the rapid
   migration of electrolyte ions. An asymmetric supercapacitor was also
   made and studied with Ni(OH)(2)/UGF as the positive electrode and
   activated microwave exfoliated graphite oxide ('a-MEGO') as the negative
   electrode. The highest power density of the fully packaged asymmetric
   cell (44.0 kW/kg) was much higher (2-27 times higher), while the energy
   density was comparable to or higher, than high-end commercially
   available supercapacitors. This asymmetric supercapacitor had a

Abstract = {{We recently introduced new petrophysical and compositional methods for
   joint interpretation of multiple conventional well logs. These
   inversion-based methods are suited for petrophysical interpretation of
   rock formations that exhibit complex solid composition, include thin
   beds, and are subject to mud-filtrate invasion. They combine nuclear and
   resistivity logs to assess porosity and volumetric/weight concentrations
   of mineral and fluid constituents, and are ideal for the quantitative
   interpretation of carbonate formations. We document the successful
   application of the newly introduced inversion-based interpretation
   methods to three carbonate formations. Interpretation results are
   compared to those obtained with commercial software and core/X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) data whenever available. For two of the carbonate
   field examples where XRD data are available, nonlinear joint inversion
   of well logs improves the assessment of porosity by more than 30\% and
   up to 100\% in the presence of thin beds when compared to conventional
   interpretation methods.}},

Abstract = {{Multimode fibers (MMF) are generally used in short and medium haul
   optical networks owing to the availability of low cost devices and
   inexpensive packaging solutions. However, the performance of
   conventional multimode fibers is limited primarily by the presence of
   high modal dispersion owing to large core diameters. While electronic
   dispersion compensation methods improve the bandwidth-distance product
   of MMFs, they do not utilize the fundamental diversity present in the
   different modes of the multimode fiber. In this paper, we draw from
   developments in wireless communication theory and signal processing to
   motivate the use of vector intensity modulation and signal processing to
   enable high-data rates over MMFs. Further, we discuss the implementation
   of a closed-loop system with limited channel state feedback to enable
   the use of precoding at the transmitter, and show that this technique
   enhances the performance in a 10 Gb/s MMF link, consisting of 3 km of
   conventional multimode fiber. Experimental results indicate that vector
   intensity modulation and direct detection with with two modulators and
   detectors, along with the use of limited feedback results in a 50\%
   increase over the single laser and detector case.}},

   distortion in the layers by reducing the overall magnitude of second
   normal stress differences and thus decreasing the normal in-plane

Abstract = {{We successfully prepared a highly porous graphene on carbon cloth
   (PG/CC) via an electrophoretic deposition process. With this process, in
   order to obtain high porous graphene on carbon cloth, fine-size graphene
   should be used. When large-size graphene was used, carbon cloth was only
   covered by graphene (G/CC) without porous surface. PG/CC was used as
   electrodes for Flexible All-Solid-State Supercapacitors (FASSSs). The
   porous structure of PG/CC electrode significantly increased the surface
   area of graphene and thus the specific capacitance (79.19 F g(-1) for
   PG/CC and 32.35 F g(-1) for G/CC). The macroscopic porous morphology of
   carbon cloth as the electrode matrix enhanced the integration between
   electrode and electrolyte, which is favorable for the ion diffusion and
   electron transport. The excellent mechanical stability and flexibility
   of PG/CC ensures the device with good flexibility. The resultant PG/CC
   based FASSSs showed high specific capacitance, good cycling stability,
   and enhanced energy density and power density. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{Unsafe acts of workers (e.g.,misjudgment or inappropriate operation)
   become the major root causes of construction accidents when they are
   combined with unsafe working conditions (e.g.,work surface conditions or
   weather) on a construction site. The overarching goal of the research
   presented in this paper is to explore ways to prevent unsafe acts of
   workers and reduce the likelihood of construction accidents occurring.
   The study specifically aims to (1)understand the relationships between
   human behavior related and working condition related risk factors,
   (2)identify the significant behavior and condition factors and their
   impacts on accident types (e.g.,struck by/against, caught in/between,
   falling, shock, inhalation/ingestion/absorption, or respiratory failure)
   and injury severity (e.g.,fatality, hospitalized, or nonhospitalized),
   and (3)analyze the fundamental accident-injury relationship on how each
   accident type contributes to the injury severity. The study reviewed
   9,358 accidents that occurred in the U.S. construction industry between
   2002 and 2011. The large number of accident samples supported reliable
   statistical analyses. The analysis identified a total of 17 significant
   correlations between behavior and condition factors and distinguished
   key risk factors that highly impacted on the determination of accident
   types and injury severity. The research outcomes will assist safety
   managers to control specific unsafe acts of workers by eliminating the
   associated unsafe working conditions and vice versa. They also can
   prioritize risk factors and pay more attention to controlling them to
   achieve a safer working environment. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Magnetism in graphene is an emerging field that has received much
   theoretical attention. In particular, there have been exciting
   predictions for induced magnetism through proximity to a ferromagnetic
   insulator as well as through localized dopants and defects. Here, the
   authors discuss their experimental work using molecular beam epitaxy to
   modify the surface of graphene and induce novel spin-dependent
   phenomena. First, they investigate the epitaxial growth of the
   ferromagnetic insulator EuO on graphene and discuss possible scenarios
   for realizing exchange splitting and exchange fields by ferromagnetic
   insulators. Second, they investigate the properties of magnetic moments
   in graphene originating from localized p(z)-orbital defects (i.e.,
   adsorbed hydrogen atoms). The behavior of these magnetic moments is
   studied using nonlocal spin transport to directly probe the spin-degree
   of freedom of the defect-induced states. They also report the presence
   of enhanced electron g-factors caused by the exchange fields present in
   the system. Importantly, the exchange field is found to be highly gate
   dependent, with decreasing g-factors with increasing carrier densities.

Abstract = {{Asynchronous impulsive noise and periodic impulsive noises limit
   communication performance in OFDM power-line communication systems.
   Conventional OFDM receivers that assume additive white Gaussian noise
   experience degradation in communication performance in impulsive noise.
   Alternate designs assume a statistical noise model and use the model
   parameters in mitigating impulsive noise. These receivers require
   training overhead for parameter estimation, and degrade due to model and
   parameter mismatch. To mitigate asynchronous impulsive noise, we exploit
   its sparsity in the time domain, and apply sparse Bayesian learning
   methods to estimate and subtract the noise impulses. We propose three
   iterative algorithms with different complexity vs. performance
   trade-offs: (1) we utilize the noise projection onto null and pilot
   tones; (2) we add the information in the date tones to perform joint
   noise estimation and symbol detection; (3) we use decision feedback from
   the decoder to further enhance the accuracy of noise estimation. These
   algorithms are also embedded in a time-domain block interleaving OFDM
   system to mitigate periodic impulsive noise. Compared to conventional
   OFDM receivers, the proposed methods achieve SNR gains of up to 9 dB in
   coded and 10 dB in uncoded systems in asynchronous impulsive noise, and
   up to 6 dB in coded systems in periodic impulsive noise.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the recovery of a low-rank matrix from an observed

   performance guarantee on when minimizing nuclear norm plus norm succeeds
   in exact recovery. Our result allows for the simultaneous presence of
   random and deterministic components in both the error and erasure
   patterns. By specializing this one single result in different ways, we
   recover (up to poly-log factors) as corollaries all the existing results
   in exact matrix completion, and exact sparse and low-rank matrix
   decomposition. Our unified result also provides the first guarantees for
   1) recovery when we observe a vanishing fraction of entries of a

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{3671-3682}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recently, there has been a significant interest in developing
   cooperative sensing systems for certain types of wireless applications.
   In such systems, a group of sensing nodes periodically
   collectsmeasurements about the signals being observed in the given
   geographical region and transmits these measurements to a central node,
   which in turn processes this information to recover the signals. For
   example, in cognitive radio networks, the signals of interest are those
   generated by the primary transmitters and the sensing nodes are the
   secondary users. In such networks, it is critically important to be able
   to reliably determine the presence or absence of primary transmitters in
   order to avoid causing interference. The standard approach to
   transmitting these measurements from the sensor nodes to the fusion
   center has been to use orthogonal channels. Such an approach quickly
   places a burden on the control-channel-capacity of the network that
   would scale linearly in the number of cooperating sensing nodes. In this
   paper, we show that as long as one condition is satisfied: the dynamics
   of the observed signals are sparse, i.e., the observed signals do not
   change their values very rapidly in relation to the time-scale at which
   the measurements are collected, we can significantly reduce the control
   bandwidth of the system while achieving near full (linear) bandwidth
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon is considered one of the most promising anode materials for
   high-performance Li-ion batteries due to its 4200 mAh/g theoretical
   specific capacity, relative abundance, low cost, and environmental
   benignity. However, silicon experiences a dramatic volume change
   (similar to 300\%) during full charge/discharge cycling, leading to
   severe capacity decay and poor cycling stability. Here, we report a
   three-dimensional (3D) ternary silicon nanoparticles/conducting
   polymer/carbon nanotubes hybrid anode material for Li-ion batteries. The
   hierarchical conductive hydrogel framework with carbon nanotubes as the
   electronic fortifier offers a continuous electron transport network and
   high porosity to accommodate the volume expansion of Si particles. By 3D
   wrapping of silicon nanoparticles/single-wall carbon nanotubes with
   conducting polymer nanostructures, a greatly improved cycling
   performance is achieved with reversible discharge capacity over 1600
   mAh/g and 86\% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at the current rate
   of 3.3 A/g. Our findings represent a new direction for fabricating
   robust, high-performance lithium-ion batteries and related energy
   storage applications with advanced nanostructured materials.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric microphones with out-of-plane directivity are introduced.

   A discussion of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) merits of the approach is

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We consider the problem of partitioning an area in the plane populated
   by a team of aerial/marine vehicles into a finite collection of
   non-overlapping sets. The sets of this partition are in an one-to-one
   correspondence with the vehicles under the following rule: each point in
   the given set of the partition can be reached by the corresponding
   vehicle in this set faster than any other vehicle in the presence of a
   spatiotemporal drift field. Consequently, a Voronoi-like partition
   results, which encodes the proximity relations between the vehicles and
   arbitrary points in the plane with respect to the minimum time-to-go.
   The construction of this Voronoi-like partition is based on its
   interpretation as the intersection of a forest of the cost (minimum
   time-to-go) surfaces emanating from each generator with their common
   lower envelope. The characterization of each cost surface is achieved by
   means of an efficient expansion scheme of the level sets of the minimum
   time-to-go function, which utilizes, in turn, the structure of the
   optimal synthesis of the minimum-time problem without resorting to
   exhaustive numerical techniques, e.g., fast marching methods. We examine
   the topological characteristics of the partition by using control/system
   theoretic concepts and tools. The theoretical developments are
   illustrated with a number of numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Occlusions in single cortical microvessels lead to a reduction in oxygen
   supply, but this decrement has not been able to be quantified in three

   We demonstrate a combined optical system using two-photon
   phosphorescence lifetime and fluorescence microscopy (2PLM) to
   characterize the partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) in single descending
   cortical arterioles in the mouse brain before and after generating a
   targeted photothrombotic occlusion. Integrated real-time Laser Speckle
   Contrast Imaging (LSCI) provides wide-field perfusion maps that are used
   to monitor and guide the occlusion process while 2PLM maps changes in
   intravascular oxygen tension. We present the technique's utility in
   highlighting the effects of vascular networking on the residual
   intravascular oxygen tensions measured after occlusion in three

Abstract = {{Fatigue cracking resistance of asphalt binders and composites is
   influenced by the presence of modifiers and aging conditions. This paper
   presents the findings from a study conducted to evaluate the fatigue
   cracking resistance of asphalt mortars or fine aggregate matrix (FAM) as
   influenced by two factors: (i) the presence of warm mix additives with
   reduced short-term aging temperatures and (ii) the influence of
   long-term aging of the mix. Combinations of two binders with four
   different warm mix additives and one aggregate type were used to
   evaluate the first factor. The second factor was evaluated by subjecting
   the loose mix to extended aging in an environmental room at high
   temperatures. X-ray CT analysis were conducted on a limited number of
   samples compacted, before and after extended aging to ensure that the
   internal structure of the specimen did not change significantly and the
   differences in performance could be attributed to aging of the mix. A
   dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) was used to evaluate the fatigue
   cracking resistance of the FAM test specimens. The stiffness and the
   fatigue cracking resistance of the FAM specimens were compared before
   and after long-term aging. Results indicate that the specific
   binder-additive pair governed the influence of the warm mix additive on
   the fatigue cracking life of the FAM specimens. More importantly,
   results also indicate that the rank order of the short-term aged
   mixtures, in terms of their fatigue cracking resistance, did not change
   significantly after long-term aging. The ranking of fatigue cracking
   resistance of short-term aged specimens using different binders
   correlated well with the ranking of fatigue cracking resistance of
   long-term aged specimens. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{217-221}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we study the ability of a passive, evaporative pumping
   system to dissipate thermal energy from a constant heat flux source. For
   that, an instrumented experimental setup was built wherein a thin, flat
   porous membrane was placed on top of a circular copper made heater.
   Evaporation from the membrane continually drew distilled water from a
   reservoir through the system. The tests aimed to parametrically
   determine the effect of the heat flux dissipated by the membrane on the
   evaporation rate, heater temperature, and the suction pressure created
   by evaporation. The maximum suction pressure can ultimately be used to
   estimate the maximum pumping height differential between the evaporative
   surface and the free water surface of the reservoir. The results
   obtained indicated that there was a direct relationship between the
   heater power and the evaporation rate, within the range of parameters
   investigated. Also, the results showed that for a heat flux up to 2220
   W/m(2), which is more than twice the terrestrial solar irradiation, the
   heater temperature was roughly 45 degrees C, 28 degrees C below the
   temperature of an equivalent surface cooled purely by natural
   convection. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the undrained shear stiffness of sand bentonite
   specimens (with 0\%, 3\%, and 5\% bentonite by dry mass of the sand)
   prepared at the same skeleton void ratio (D-rsk = 35\% to 40\%) using a
   dry pluviation technique. The experimental program consisted of (1)
   small strain tests using a resonant column apparatus and (2) large
   strain tests using a cyclic triaxial apparatus. The resonant column
   tests were performed at three confining stress levels (50, 100, and 193
   kPa) under drained and undrained conditions. A comparison of the shear
   modulus reduction with shear strains for both drained and undrained
   conditions is presented; the effects of changes in effective stresses
   and the rate of modulus reduction as a function of the effective Stress
   are discussed to describe the discrepancy between the two sets of data.
   The results show a marginal decrease in G(max) for specimens with
   bentonite, which is attributed to the presence of bentonite at the sand
   grain contacts. However, the presence of bentonite increases the linear
   elastic threshold, particularly in the case of undrained tests, in which
   a noticeable delay in excess pore pressure generation was measured. The
   strain level required in order to initiate excess pore pressure
   generation increased with increasing bentonite content. A similar trend
   was noted in cyclic triaxial tests, in which, for a given strain,
   specimens with bentonite generated lower excess pressure than sand
   specimens tested under similar conditions. Finally, a combined
   normalized G/G(max) curve from both tests is presented for specimens
   with 0\%, 3\%, and 5\% bentonite at 100 kPa.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of a new nuclear power plant requires an excavation
   over 27.4 m (90 ft) deep. The excavation is backfilled with compacted
   sandy soils. The power plant is embedded about 12.2 m (40 ft) below
   grade; thus bearing on about 15.2 m (50 ft) of compacted backfill.
   During licensing and design of the plant, the shear wave velocity
   profile of the proposed backfill was estimated using results from
   laboratory testing {[}combined resonant column and torsional shear
   (RCTS)] and in situ shear wave velocity measurements. RCTS tests were
   conducted on representative samples of potential borrow sources. In situ
   velocity measurements, which included spectral-analysis-of-surface waves
   (SASW) and cross-hole seismic testing methods, were conducted on a
   6.1-m- (20-ft-) thick embedded test pad of the potential borrow. During
   construction of the production backfill, in situ shear wave velocity
   measurements, using SASW methods, were taken at four levels during
   backfill placement, spaced nominally 6.1 to 7.6 m (20 to 25 ft) apart.
   The fourth and final level of testing was conducted nominally at plant
   grade. Cross-hole seismic testing through the backfill was also
   conducted at this level. This paper compares the results of estimated
   values made during the licensing and design phases of the project, based
   primarily on laboratory test results, with in situ shear wave velocity
   measurements made during the actual construction. In particular, SASW
   results from the first two levels of backfill tested {[}about 7.6 and
   15.2 m (25 and 50 ft) of backfill] are evaluated. Results from the final
   two test levels of backfill, along with results of cross-hole testing,
   were not available at this writing. The comparison of laboratory results
   and in situ testing provides good agreement The assumptions made to
   develop the estimated values during the licensing phase are compared to
   the as-built measurements of shear wave velocity accounting for actual
   backfill materials and construction practices reflected in the in situ
   values.}},

Abstract = {{The navigation of a small unmanned aerial vehicle is challenging due to
   a large influence of wind to its kinematics. When the kinematic model is
   reduced to two dimensions, it has the form of the Dubins kinematic
   vehicle model. Consequently, this paper addresses the problem of
   minimizing the expected time required to drive a Dubins vehicle to a
   prescribed target set in the presence of a stochastically varying wind.
   First, two analytically-derived control laws are presented. One control
   law does not consider the presence of the wind, whereas the other
   assumes that the wind is constant and known a priori. In the latter case
   it is assumed that the prevailing wind is equal to its mean value; no
   information about the variations of the wind speed and direction is
   available. Next, by employing numerical techniques from stochastic
   optimal control, feedback control strategies are computed. These
   anticipate the stochastic variation of the wind and drive the vehicle to
   its target set while minimizing the expected time of arrival. The
   analysis and numerical simulations show that the analytically-derived
   deterministic optimal control for this problem captures, in many cases,
   the salient features of the optimal feedback control for the stochastic
   wind model, providing support for the use of the former in the presence
   of light winds. On the other hand, the controllers anticipating the
   stochastic wind variation lead to more robust and more predictable
   trajectories than the ones obtained using feedback controllers for
   deterministic wind models.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate non-invasive assessment of tissue elasticity in vivo is
   required for early diagnostics of many tissue abnormalities. We have
   developed a focused air-pulse system that produces a low-pressure and
   short-duration air stream, which can be used to excite transient surface
   waves (SWs) in soft tissues. System characteristics were studied using a
   high-resolution analog pressure transducer to describe the excitation
   pressure. Results indicate that the excitation pressure provided by the
   air-pulse system can be easily controlled by the air source pressure,
   the angle of delivery, and the distance between the tissue surface and
   the port of the air-pulse system. Furthermore, we integrated this
   focused air-pulse system with phase-sensitive optical coherence
   tomography (PhS-OCT) to make non-contact measurements of tissue
   elasticity. The PhS-OCT system is used to assess the group velocity of
   SW propagation, which can be used to determine Young's modulus. Pilot
   experiments were performed on gelatin phantoms with different
   concentrations (10\%, 12\% and 14\% w/w). The results demonstrate the
   feasibility of using this focused air-pulse system combined with PhS-OCT
   to estimate tissue elasticity. This easily controlled non-contact
   technique is potentially useful to study the biomechanical properties of
   ocular and other tissues in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the thermal behavior of a cylindrical asphalt tank
   subjected to two different heating configurations: (i) large area
   serpentine heating and (ii) concentrated heating cartridges, was studied
   numerically and experimentally. The goal is to investigate the effect of
   these two heating configurations on the temperature distribution of the
   molten asphalt inside the tank, as well as to validate
   temperature-dependent thermal-physical properties of molten asphalt
   employed in the numerical simulations. For the experimental setup, a
   scaled tank having a volume of approximately 0.2 m(3) was built, and
   filled with molten asphalt. The setup was fully instrumented and run at
   different heat dissipations rates for each of the heating
   configurations. The experimental results show that the temperature
   distribution within the tank depends on the heating method and on the
   heat dissipation level, as expected, however, both heating methods were
   able to prevent the solidification of the enclosed asphalt and so are
   feasible for actual application in storage tanks. As for the numerical
   work, two models representing both experimental heating configurations

Abstract = {{Objective-The mechanisms promoting the focal formation of rupture-prone
   coronary plaques in vivo remain incompletely understood. This study
   tested the hypothesis that coronary regions exposed to low endothelial
   shear stress (ESS) favor subsequent development of collagen-poor,
   thin-capped plaques.
   Approach and Results-Coronary angiography and 3-vessel intravascular
   ultrasound were serially performed at 5 consecutive time points in vivo
   in 5 diabetic, hypercholesterolemic pigs. ESS was calculated along the
   course of each artery with computational fluid dynamics at all 5 time
   points. At follow-up, 184 arterial segments with previously identified
   in vivo ESS underwent histopathologic analysis. Compared with other
   plaque types, eccentric thin-capped atheromata developed more in
   segments that experienced lower ESS during their evolution. Compared
   with lesions with higher preceding ESS, segments persistently exposed to
   low ESS (<1.2 Pa) exhibited reduced intimal smooth muscle cell content;
   marked intimal smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation; attenuated
   procollagen-I gene expression; increased gene and protein expression of
   the interstitial collagenases matrix-metalloproteinase-1, -8, -13, and
   -14; increased collagenolytic activity; reduced collagen content; and
   marked thinning of the fibrous cap.
   Conclusions-Eccentric thin-capped atheromata, lesions particularly prone
   to rupture, form more frequently in coronary regions exposed to low ESS
   throughout their evolution. By promoting an imbalance of attenuated
   synthesis and augmented collagen breakdown, low ESS favors the focal
   evolution of early lesions toward plaques with reduced collagen content
   and thin fibrous caps-2 critical determinants of coronary plaque
   vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBs) demonstrate properties that make
   them attractive as metamodels, or surrogate models, for engineering
   design purposes. Previous research has resulted in the development of

   approach to robust optimization that employs NURBs-based metamodels.
   This robust optimization technique exploits the unique structure of
   NURBs-based metamodels to derive a simple but effective robustness
   metric. An algorithm is demonstrated that uses this metric to weigh
   robustness against optimality, and visualizes the trade-offs between
   these metamodel properties. This approach is demonstrated with test
   problems of increasing dimensionality, including several practical
   design challenges.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Various forms of the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) have been studied
   extensively over the past decades. This paper introduces a new version
   of the heterogeneous PDP in which the capacity of each vehicle can be
   modified by reconfiguring its interior to satisfy different types of
   customer demands. The work was motivated by a daily route planning
   problem arising at a senior activity center. A fleet of configurable
   vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the
   center as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical
   treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van
   can accommodate depends on how it is configured.
   The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program much the same way as a
   PDP but with side constraints that add another level of complexity. To
   find solutions, we developed a two-phase heuristic that makes use of
   ideas from greedy randomized adaptive search procedures with multiple
   starts. In phase I, a set of good feasible solutions is constructed
   using a series of randomized procedures. A representative subset of
   those solutions is selected as candidates for improvement by solving a
   max diversity problem. In phase II, an adaptive large neighborhood
   search (ALNS) heuristic is used to find local optima by reconstructing
   portions of the feasible routes. Specialized removal and insertion
   heuristics were designed for this purpose. Also, a specialized route
   feasibility check with vehicle type reassignment is introduced to take
   full advantage of the heterogeneous nature of vehicles. The
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by comparing
   the solutions it provided over a period of several weeks with those that
   were used in practice and derived manually. The analysis indicates that
   anywhere from 30\% to 40\% savings can be achieved with the multi-start
   ALNS heuristic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous 3-(methylamino)propylamine (MAPA) has been investigated as a

   lower capacity, slower mass-transfer coefficient, higher viscosity, and
   greater susceptibility to thermal degradation than 7 m MEA. In the
   presence of oxygen, MAPA degraded more than ten times faster than MEA.
   Inhibitor A substantially reduced the oxidation rates of MAPA and MEA,
   although oxidation was still significant compared with PZ (which did not
   oxidize). Overall, MAPA did not offer any significant benefits over the

Abstract = {{An efficient integral-equation method is presented for the analysis of
   electromagnetic scattering from arbitrarily shaped 3-D dielectric
   objects embedded in a single layer of a uniaxial planar-layered medium.
   The proposed method employs a mixed-potential volume electric-field
   integral equation (VEFIE) that permits the object of interest to be
   dispersive, anisotropic, inhomogeneous, and of arbitrary shape. The
   VEFIE is solved by an iterative frequency-domain method-of-moments
   procedure. The object is discretized by tetrahedral elements, and the
   procedure is accelerated by the adaptive integral method, which reduces
   the computational costs by enclosing the tetrahedral mesh with an
   auxiliary regular grid and performing anterpolation (mesh to grid),
   propagation (grid to grid), interpolation (grid to mesh), and near-zone
   correction (mesh to mesh) steps. The computationally dominant
   propagation step of the method is accelerated by decomposing the Green's
   functions into convolution and correlation terms in the stratification
   direction and using 3-D fast Fourier transforms to multiply the
   resulting propagation matrices with the necessary vectors. If the object
   of interest is meshed using N tetrahedra that are of a single length
   scale, then the setup time, memory requirement, and the iterative
   matrix-solution time (per iteration) of the proposed method scale as
   O(N), O(N), and O(N logN), respectively. Numerical results validate the
   method's accuracy and efficiency for various problems relevant to

   geometries to be represented in an approximate fashion. In recent
   research, the authors have developed a new formulation suitable for
   application to any solid model described by an unstructured hexahedral

   ellipsoidal particle discretization of the mass distribution described
   by a general hex mesh and a new density interpolation suitable for use
   with general ellipsoidal arrays whose particles vary in mass, shape, and
   spatial orientation. Application of the method in the simulation of
   high-velocity impact problems shows good agreement with experiment, for
   both smoothly graded and deliberately distorted hexahedral meshes.

   anomalous physics in the wave interaction with resonant metamaterials
   and return physically meaningful homogenized parameters that retain
   local properties in the long-wavelength limit. As a byproduct, we are

   applications. These applications capitalize on the intrinsic lower
   critical solution temperature (LCST) of the polymer: below the LCST,
   enthalpic gain from intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PNIPAM and
   water molecules dominates the solvation; above the LCST, entropic
   effects resulting from the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the
   carboxyl and amide groups of PNIPAM lead to water expulsion. The
   dependence of the LCST upon the molecular weight, solvent, and solution
   activity (i.e., solute concentration) has been studied extensively.
   However, what has not been previously explored is the effect of humidity
   on the characteristic properties of the polymer. Herein, we show that
   the relative humidity affects the water adsorption dynamics of PNIPAM as
   well as the magnitude of the transition that occurs at the LCST of the
   polymer. In short, the magnitude of the LCST transition decreases with
   an increasing relative humidity, and the time period over which
   adsorption occurs decreases with the temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The key process parameters of UV roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography
   are identified from an analysis of the fluid, curing, and peeling
   dynamics. The process includes merging of droplets of imprint material,
   curing of the imprint material from a viscous liquid to elastic solid
   resist, and pattern replication and detachment of the resist from
   template. The time and distances on the web or rigid substrate over
   which these processes occur are determined as function of the physical
   properties of the uncured liquid, the cured solid, and the roller
   configuration. The upper convected Maxwell equation is used to model the
   viscoelastic liquid and to calculate the force on the substrate and the
   torque on the roller. The available exposure time is found to be the
   rate limiting parameter and it is O(root Rh-o/u(o)), where R is the
   radius of the roller, h(o) is minimum gap between the roller and web,
   and u(o) is the velocity of the web. The residual layer thickness of the
   resist should be larger than the gap between the roller and the
   substrate to ensure complete feature filling and optimal pattern
   replication. For lower residual layer thickness, the droplets may not
   merge to form a continuous film for pattern transfer. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{We develop a kinetic Monte Carlo model for photocurrent generation in
   organic solar cells that demonstrates improved agreement with
   experimental illuminated and dark current-voltage curves. In our model,
   we introduce a charge injection rate prefactor to correct for the
   electrode grid-size and electrode charge density biases apparent in the
   coarse-grained approximation of the electrode as a grid of single
   occupancy, charge-injecting reservoirs. We use the charge injection rate
   prefactor to control the portion of dark current attributed to each of
   four kinds of charge injection. By shifting the dark current between
   electrode-polymer pairs, we align the injection timescales and expand
   the applicability of the method to accommodate ohmic energy barriers. We
   consider the device characteristics of the ITO/PEDOT/PSS:PPDI:PBTT:Al
   system and demonstrate the manner in which our model captures the device
   charge densities unique to systems with small injection energy barriers.
   To elucidate the defining characteristics of our model, we first
   demonstrate the manner in which charge accumulation and band bending
   affect the shape and placement of the various current-voltage regimes.
   We then discuss the influence of various model parameters upon the
   current-voltage characteristics. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   investigation of LiMn1.5Ni0.5-xMxO4 (M = Cu and Zn and x = 0.08 and
   0.12), in which Ni2+ ions are substituted by divalent Cu2+ and Zn2+

   occupancy, degree of cation ordering, and oxygen nonstoichiometry have
   been investigated with respect to the electrochemical properties by
   cycling at room temperature and elevated temperatures. It is found that
   although both Zn and Cu are divalent with ionic radii similar to those
   of Ni2+, they behave quite differently with respect to cation ordering
   and site occupancy, and higher levels of doping lead to distinct
   differences in cycling and rate performances. The understanding of the
   role of site preferences of the cations and the degree of cation

Abstract = {{Reactions between ozone and terpenoids produce numerous products, some
   of which may form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This work
   investigated the contribution to gas-phase SOA formation of ozone
   reactions with surface-sorbed D-limonene, which is common indoors. A
   model framework was developed to predict SOA mass formation because of
   ozone/terpenoid surface reactions,, and it was used with steady state
   experiments in a 283 L chamber to determine the aerosol mass fraction of
   SOA resulting from surface reactions, xi(s) (the ratio of mass of SOA
   formed and mass of ozone consumed by ozone/terpenoid surface reactions),
   for ozone/D-limonene reactions on stainless steel. The xi(s) =
   0.70-0.91, with lower relative humidity leading to both higher mass and
   number formation. Also, surface reactions promoted nucleation more than
   gas phase reactions, and number formation due to surface reactions and
   gas phase reactions were 126-339 and 51.1-60.2 no./cm(3) per mu g/m(3)
   of formed SOA, respectively. We also used the model framework to predict
   that indoor spaces in which ozone/D-limonene surface reactions would
   likely lead to meaningful gas phase SOA formation are those with
   surfaces that have low original reactivity with ozone, such as glass,
   sealed materials, or smooth metals.}},

Abstract = {{Subgaskets are usually applied to a catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) for
   the edge-protection of the electrolyte membrane and easy handling. They
   cover the peripheral region (non-active area) of CCM and have a defined
   window (active area) for accommodating the electrode. In this study,
   three subgasketed CCMs with different configurations were designed with
   a laboratory-scale 5 cm(2) fuel cell and the effects of the components
   underneath the subgaskets on the electrochemical properties of CCMs and
   cell performance were investigated by several electrochemical
   techniques. The results reveal that part of the catalyst layer under the
   subgaskets is activated for reaction area, leading to slightly higher
   electrochemical surface area (ESA), higher H-2 crossover, and smaller
   shorting resistance. The non-active region of subgasketed CCM has little
   impact on proton resistance in the catalyst layer, oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR) kinetics, and limiting current, but has adverse effects
   on cell performance in the low current region under dry conditions due
   to increased hydrogen crossover. The findings could provide guidelines
   for subgasket design and application in laboratory-scale fuel cells.

Abstract = {{Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) stacks consisting of 5 cells and 20
   cells were assembled with low-cost hydrocarbon blend membranes and new
   electrocatalysts with better methanol tolerance and stability. The
   hydrocarbon blend membranes consisting of an acidic polymer (sulfonated
   poly (ether ether ketone), SPEEK) and a basic polymer
   (polysulfone-2-amide-benzimidazole, PSf-ABIm) exhibited low methanol
   crossover, high conductivity, and good mechanical stability. The
   Pt-Ru-Sn-Ce/C anode catalyst exhibited better stability than the
   commercial PtRu/C catalyst, while the cathode catalyst Pd-Co/C showed
   better methanol tolerance than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. A maximum
   power of around 20 W was achieved with a DMFC stack consisting of 20
   membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) fabricated with the above membranes
   and electrocatalysts. The results demonstrate the feasibility of
   utilizing these acid-base blend membranes and novel catalysts for DMFC
   applications. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{The negative refraction and evanescent-wave canalization effects

   dielectric and plasmonic layers is theoretically analyzed. By using a
   transmission-line analysis, we formulate a way to rapidly analyze the
   negative refraction operation for given available materials over a broad
   range of frequencies and design parameters, and we apply it to broaden
   the bandwidth of negative refraction. Our analytical model is also
   applied to explore the possibility of employing active layers for loss
   compensation. Nonlinear dielectrics can also be considered within this
   approach, and they are explored in order to add tunability to the
   optical response, realizing positive-to-zero-to-negative refraction at
   the same frequency, as a function of the input intensity. Our findings
   may lead to a better physical understanding and improvement of the
   performance of negative refraction and subwavelength imaging in layered
   metamaterials, paving the way towards the design of gain-assisted
   hyperlenses and tunable nonlinear imaging devices. (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{We propose two fully discrete mixed and Galerkin finite element
   approximations to a system of equations describing the slow flow of a
   slightly compressible single phase fluid in a viscoelastic porous
   medium. One of our schemes is the natural one for the backward Euler
   time discretization but, due to the viscoelasticity, seems to be stable
   only for small enough time steps. The other scheme contains a lagged
   term in the viscous stress and pressure evolution equations and this is
   enough to prove unconditional stability. For this lagged scheme we prove
   an optimal order a priori error estimate under ideal regularity
   assumptions and demonstrate the convergence rates by using a model
   problem with a manufactured solution. The model and numerical scheme
   that we present are a natural extension to `poroviscoelasticity' of the
   poroelasticity equations and scheme studied by Philips and Wheeler in
   (for example) {[}Philip Joseph Philips, Mary F.Wheeler, Comput. Geosci.
   11 (2007) 145-158] although - importantly - their algorithms and codes
   would need only minor modifications in order to include the viscous
   effects. The equations and algorithms presented here have application to
   oil reservoir simulations and also to the condition of hydrocephalus -
   `water on the brain'. An illustrative example is given demonstrating
   that even small viscoelastic effects can produce noticeable differences
   in long-time response. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
   time a mixed and Galerkin scheme has been analysed and implemented for
   viscoelastic porous media. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber ultrafiltration (UF) and polyamide spiral
   wound reverse osmosis (RO) membrane modules were surface-modified by
   contact with an aqueous solution containing dopamine to deposit
   polydopamine on the membrane surfaces and other wetted parts inside the
   modules. UF modules were further modified by grafting poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG) brushes to the polydopamine coating. Polydopamine and
   polydopamine-g-PEG coatings increase hydrophilicity of the membrane
   surfaces and have previously been shown to improve fouling resistance
   towards model oil/water emulsions in laboratory studies. In a
   pilot-scale test treating hydraulic fracturing flowback water from the
   Barnett Shale region of Texas, the fouling performance of modified UF
   and RO membrane modules was compared to that of unmodified analogs. UF
   modules were used to remove most of the highly fouling organic matter in
   the feed before desalination by a train of RO elements.
   Polydopamine-modified UF modules maintained higher flux, lower
   transmembrane pressure difference, and improved cleaning efficiency
   relative to unmodified modules. The polydopamine coating did not appear
   to improve RO fouling behavior, presumably because most of the organic
   foulants had been removed by UF pretreatment of the feedwater. However,
   higher and more stable salt rejection was observed in modified RO
   modules than in unmodified modules. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sulfate adsorption at buried mineral/solution interfaces is of great
   interest in geochemistry and atmospheric aerosol chemistry due to the
   sulfate anion's environmental ubiquity and the wide role of physical and
   chemical phenomena that it impacts. Here we present the first
   application of total internal reflection-Raman (TIR-Raman) spectroscopy,
   a surface-sensitive spectroscopy, to probe sulfate ion behavior at the
   buried hematite/solution interface. Hematite is the most
   thermodynamically stable iron oxide polymorph and as such is widely
   found in nature. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a TIR-Raman
   approach to study simple, inorganic anion adsorption at buried
   interfaces. Moreover, our data suggest that inner-sphere sulfate
   adsorption proceeds in a bidentate fashion at the hematite surface.
   These results help clarify long-standing questions as to whether sulfate
   forms inner-sphere adsorption complexes at hematite surfaces in a mono-
   or bidentate fashion based on attenuated total reflection-infrared
   (ATR-IR) observations. Our results are discussed with perspective to
   this debate and the applicability of TIR-Raman spectroscopy to address
   ambiguities of ion adsorption to mineral surfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   The organoclay dispersion facilitated by the maleated PP helps to reduce
   the size of the dispersed phase elastomer particles in the PP matrix.
   The elastomer particle size decreased significantly as the

   of the injection molded sample is similar to a prolate ellipsoid. The
   CTE decreased significantly in the FD and TD, whereas a slight increase
   is observed in the normal direction in the presence of MMT and PP-g-MA.
   The Chow model based on a two population approach showed better fit to

   islands and the substrate starts from the edge of the islands. As the
   strain is increased, the interfacial cracks grow in a stable fashion. At
   a given applied strain, the width of the delaminated region is a unique
   function of the interfacial fracture energy. We have calculated the
   energy release rate driving the delamination as a function of
   delamination width, island size, island thickness, and applied strain.
   For a given materials system, this relationship allows determination of
   the interfacial fracture energy from a measurement of the delamination
   width. The technique is demonstrated by measuring the interfacial
   fracture energy of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition SiNx
   islands on a polyimide substrate. We anticipate that this technique will
   find application in the flexible electronics industry where hard islands
   on soft substrates are a common architecture to protect active devices
   from fracture. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Monoclinic alpha-Li3V2(PO4)(3) has a complex 3-D metal phosphate
   framework that provides mobility for all three lithium ions, giving it
   the highest gravimetric capacity (197 mAh/g) of all the transition-metal
   phosphates. Along with its high gravimetric capacity, its thermal and
   electrochemical stability make it of great interest as a cathode
   material for lithium-ion energy storage devices. Raman spectroscopy has
   proven to be a unique analytical tool for studying electrode materials
   of lithium-ion batteries due to its ability to probe structural changes
   at the level of chemical bonds. In this work, the calculated Raman
   spectrum of alpha-Li3V2(PO4)(3) provided by density functional theory is
   presented along with symmetry assignments for all of the calculated and
   observed modes through Raman microscopy. Furthermore, the phase
   stability of microcrystalline alpha-Li3V2(PO4)(3) was studied as a
   function of irradiation power density. Follow-up thermal studies confirm
   that two structural phase transitions, beta and gamma, occur at elevated
   temperatures or high irradiation power density before degradation to
   alpha-LiVOPO4 under an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Calculated and
   experimentally determined Raman modes for alpha-Li3V2(PO4)(3) are in
   good agreement. It is also noted that careful consideration of the
   irradiation power density employed must be taken into account to prevent
   misinterpretation of Raman spectral features.}},

Abstract = {{A strategy to replicate fingerprint patterns formed by the self-assembly
   of lamella-forming block copolymer (BCP) was investigated. To accomplish
   this, liquid conformal layers were placed between the surfaces of a
   ``master{''} BCP film and a transparent ``replica{''} substrate that
   solidified and covalently bonded to the BCP upon exposure to light The
   benzophenone-containing conformal layer enabled pattern replication over
   areas limited only by the size of the samples and exposure field. The
   replication step is light activated, occurs below the glass transition
   of the BCP, and takes less than 1 h. This demonstration used a
   poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) BCP with a bulk domain periodicity
   of 42 nm, but it is possible that the chemistry may be generalized to
   many other BCPs. Control experiments conducted with alternative
   conformal layer compositions indicate that interfacial
   photosensitization of the BCP by excited benzophenone, followed by
   propagation to residual acrylate groups present in the conformal layer,
   is the primary mechanism by which pattern replication takes place.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a scaled particle theory for the coil-globule

   upper. critical solution temperature (UCST) related CGT at a high
   pressure hypercritical point The predicted hypercritical point is in
   good agreement with simulations of a bead-spring polymer chain in a
   symmetric solvent, without the use of any adjustable parameters. The
   model predicts that increasing bulkiness of monomers relative to solvent
   molecules, decreasing polymer cohesive energy relative to solvent
   cohesive energy, and reduced chain length stabilize the expanded coil
   state, in qualitative agreement with simulations. These trends in the
   UCST-CGT and LCST-CGT are found to emerge from incompressible solvent
   effects and equation-of-state effects, respectively, consistent with the
   enthalpic origin of the UCST and the entropic origin of the LCST.}},

Abstract = {{High-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled to atomic pair

   the synthesis route and surface chemistry. In this case, one method
   produced Si nanoparticles that are highly crystalline but surface
   oxidized, whereas a different method yields organic ligand-passivated
   nanoparticles without surface oxide but that are structurally distorted
   at the atomic scale. Particular structural features of the oxide-free Si
   nanoparticles such as average first coordination numbers, length of
   structural coherence, and degree of local distortions are compared to
   their optical properties such as photoluminescence emission energy,
   quantum yield, and Raman spectra. A clear structure properties
   correlation is observed indicating that the former may need to be taken

Abstract = {{The complete biosynthetic replacement of petroleum transportation fuels
   requires a metabolic pathway capable of producing short chain n-alkanes.
   Here, we report and characterize a proof-of-concept pathway that enables
   microbial production of the C-5 n-alkane, pentane. This pathway utilizes
   a soybean lipoxygenase enzyme to cleave linoleic acid to pentane and a
   tridecadienoic acid byproduct. Initial expression of the soybean
   lipoxygenase enzyme within a Yarrowia lipolytica host yielded 1.56 mg/L
   pentane. Efforts to improve pentane yield by increasing substrate
   availability and strongly overexpressing the lipoxygenase enzyme
   successfully increased pentane production three-fold to 4.98 mg/L. This
   work represents the first-ever microbial production of pentane and
   demonstrates that short chain n-alkane synthesis is conceivable in model
   cellular hosts. In this regard, we demonstrate the potential pliability
   of Y. lipolytica toward the biosynthetic production of value-added
   molecules from its generous fatty acid reserves. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Intramolecular collision dynamics play an essential role in biomolecular
   folding and function and, increasingly, in the performance of biomimetic
   technologies. To date, however, the quantitative studies of dynamics of
   single-stranded nucleic acids have been limited. Thus motivated, here we
   investigate the sequence composition, chain-length, viscosity, and
   temperature dependencies of the end-to-end collision dynamics of
   single-stranded DNAs. We find that both the absolute collision rate and
   the temperature dependencies of these dynamics are base-composition
   dependent, suggesting that base stacking interactions are a significant
   contributor. For example, whereas the end-to-end collision dynamics of
   poly-thymine exhibit simple, linear Arrhenius behavior, the behavior of
   longer poly-adenine constructs is more complicated. Specifically, 20-
   and 25-adenine constructs exhibit biphasic temperature dependencies,
   with their temperature dependences becoming effectively
   indistinguishable from that of poly-thymine above 335 K for 20-adenines
   and 328 K for 25-adenines. The differing Arrhenius behaviors of
   poly-thymine and poly-adenine and the chain-length dependence of the
   temperature at which poly-adenine crosses over to behave like
   poly-thymine can be explained by a barrier friction mechanism in which,
   at low temperatures, the energy barrier for the local rearrangement of
   poly-adenine becomes the dominant contributor to its end-to-end
   collision dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Despite tremendous inroads in the development a of more sensitive liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass,, spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) strategies for mass
   spectrometry-based proteomics, there remains a significant need for
   enhancing the selectivity of MS/MS-based,workflows for streamlined
   analysis of complex biological mixtures. Here, a novel LC-MS/MS platform
   based on 351 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) is presented for
   the selective analysis of cysteine peptide subsets in complex protein
   digests. Cysteine-selective UVPD is mediated through the site-specific
   conjugation of reduced cysteine residues with a,351, run active
   chromogenic Alexa Fluor 350 (AF350) maleimide tag. Only peptides
   containing the AF350 chromophore undergo photodissociation into
   extensive arrays of b- and y-type fragment ions, thus providing a facile
   means for differentiating cysteine peptide targets from convoluting
   peptide backgrounds. With the use of this approach in addition to
   strategic proteolysis, the selective analysis of diagnostic heavy-chain
   complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of single-chain antibody
   (scAb), fragments is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The delivery of plastic fines such as bentonite into loose saturated
   granular soil deposits is an effective method for mitigating the
   liquefaction phenomenon. While the bentonite should be injected into the
   deposits in the form of a concentrated suspension, such application is
   limited in practice because of the low mobility of the suspension. The
   initial mobility of the bentonite suspension should be managed in order
   to increase the penetration depth. On the other hand, the suspension
   needs to maintain its thixotropic nature to improve the resistance of
   the treated soils under cyclic loading over time. The objective of the
   present study was to investigate the dynamic rheological properties of
   the bentonite suspensions modified with an ionic additive, sodium
   pyrophosphate (SPP), to evaluate a possible application of the modified
   suspensions in mitigation of liquefaction. In the present study, the
   storage and loss modulus of SPP-modified bentonite suspensions were
   measured using a strain-sweep (oscillatory shear) technique. Bentonite
   suspensions with clay contents of 5, 7.5, 10, and 12 wt.\% (by total
   weight of suspension) were tested at various SPP concentrations (0 to 4
   wt.\% by weight of dry bentonite). The time-dependent behavior of the
   suspensions was evaluated with a critical storage modulus at various
   resting times (0 to 480 h). The results showed that the initial critical
   storage modulus decreased significantly with increasing SPP
   concentrations, but the reduced critical storage modulus increased
   gradually with resting times. This initial reduction in critical storage
   modulus is attributed to a reduction of the inter-aggregated 3-D
   networks due to the presence of SPP; the amount of 3-D network formed in
   a suspension governs the critical storage modulus. With time, the
   networks are formed gradually, resulting in recovery of critical storage
   modulus. The normalized modulus was degraded more slowly in the modified
   suspensions than in the unmodified suspensions, which is a desirable
   property of the suspensions for mitigation of liquefaction.}},

Abstract = {{A new graph grammar based reasoning is proposed to reason about the
   manufacturability of 3D solid models. The knowledge captured in the
   graph grammar rules serves as a virtual machinist in its ability to
   recognize arbitrary geometries and match them to various machining
   operations. For a given part, its 3D CAD geometry is first decomposed
   into multiple subvolumes, where each is assumed to be machined in one
   operation. The decomposed part is then converted into a graph so that
   the graph-grammar rules can perform further reasoning and determine the
   machining details. A candidate plan is a feasible sequence of all of the
   necessary machining operations needed to manufacture this part. For each
   operation, the rules determine the face on the part that the tool
   enters, the type of tools used, the type of machine used, and how the
   part is fixed within the machine. If a given geometry is not machinable,
   the rules will fail to find a complete manufacturing plan for all of the
   subvolumes. As a result of this reasoning, designers can quickly get
   insights into how a part can be made and how it can be improved (e.g.,
   change features to reduce time and cost) based upon the feedback of the
   rules. A variety of tests on this algorithm on both simple and complex
   engineering parts show its effectiveness and efficiency.}},

Journal = {{GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{174-190}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an investigation into the deformation response of
   geosynthetic-reinforced soil layers to evaluate the level of strain
   required to mobilize reinforcement mechanisms during surface loading.
   Specifically, an assessment of data from previous studies reporting
   surface settlements of reinforced and unreinforced soil layers during
   monotonic or cyclic loading to failure is complemented with new dynamic
   tests performed at small-and medium-strain magnitudes. A series of test
   sections with and without geosynthetic reinforcement were characterized
   using a Vibroseis shaker truck as a dynamic loading source. The behavior
   of uniform sand layers under relatively small strain magnitudes (shear
   strain magnitudes less than 0.2\%) were characterized using embedded
   geophones. Shear and normal strain distributions within the test
   sections were measured as a function of depth during application of
   surface shear loading. The presence of geosynthetic reinforcement
   (either geogrid or geotextile) at a depth of 254 mm below the surface of
   the sand layer does not significantly alter the distributions of shear
   strain or vertical normal strain relative to an unreinforced control
   section for the magnitudes of shear and compressive strains applied to
   the soil surface. The behavior of aggregate base layers overlying sand
   layers under medium strain magnitudes (surface deflections up to 25 mm)
   were characterized using an array of LVDTs on the soil surface. Surface
   deflection basins were measured during application of several thousand
   cycles of compressive loading. The presence of a geogrid within the
   aggregate base layer or a woven geotextile beneath the aggregate base
   layer were observed not to lead to a change in the surface deflection
   basins up to a maximum deflection of 25 mm. These observations, together
   with results from the literature, indicate that reinforcement mechanisms
   such as lateral restraint and the tensioned-membrane effect may not be
   mobilized until reaching relatively large displacements in some soil
   layers.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale modal confinement is known to radically enhance the effect of
   intrinsic Kerr and Raman nonlinearities within nanophotonic silicon
   waveguides. By contrast, stimulated Brillouin-scattering nonlinearities,
   which involve coherent coupling between guided photon and phonon modes,
   are stifled in conventional nanophotonics, preventing the realization of
   a host of Brillouin-based signal-processing technologies in silicon.
   Here we demonstrate stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon
   waveguides, for the first time, through a new class of hybrid
   photonic-phononic waveguides. Tailorable travelling-wave
   forward-stimulated Brillouin scattering is realized-with over 1,000
   times larger nonlinearity than reported in previous systems-yielding
   strong Brillouin coupling to phonons from 1 to 18 GHz. Experiments show
   that radiation pressures, produced by subwavelength modal confinement,
   yield enhancement of Brillouin nonlinearity beyond those of material
   nonlinearity alone. In addition, such enhanced and wideband coherent
   phonon emission paves the way towards the hybridization of silicon
   photonics, microelectromechanical systems and CMOS signal-processing
   technologies on chip.}},

Abstract = {{Room temperature, broadly tunable, electrically pumped semiconductor
   sources in the terahertz spectral range, similar in operation simplicity
   to diode lasers, are highly desired for applications. An emerging
   technology in this area are sources based on intracavity
   difference-frequency generation in dual-wavelength mid-infrared quantum
   cascade lasers. Here we report terahertz quantum cascade laser sources
   based on an optimized non-collinear Cherenkov difference-frequency
   generation scheme that demonstrates dramatic improvements in
   performance. Devices emitting at 4 THz display a
   mid-infrared-to-terahertz conversion efficiency in excess of 0.6mWW(-2)
   and provide nearly 0.12mW of peak power output. Devices emitting at 2
   and 3 THz fabricated on the same chip display 0.09 and 0.4mWW(-2)
   conversion efficiencies at room temperature, respectively. High
   terahertz-generation efficiency and relaxed phase-matching conditions
   offered by the Cherenkov scheme allowed us to demonstrate, for the first
   time, an external-cavity terahertz quantum cascade laser source tunable
   between 1.70 and 5.25 THz.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon has a high-specific capacity as an anode material for Li-ion
   batteries, and much research has been focused on overcoming the poor

   resulting in a well-connected three-dimensional network structure
   consisting of Si nanoparticles conformally coated by the conducting
   polymer. Such a hierarchical hydrogel framework combines multiple
   advantageous features, including a continuous electrically conductive
   polyaniline network, binding with the Si surface through either the
   crosslinker hydrogen bonding with phytic acid or electrostatic
   interaction with the positively charged polymer, and porous space for
   volume expansion of Si particles. With this anode, we demonstrate a

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{140-145}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As models of energy movement in buildings and tools for load calculation
   become more refined, more accurate descriptions of fluid mechanics and
   heat transfer in perimeter zones are needed. New construction which
   includes glass curtain walls around perimeter zones presents a unique
   challenge. A mixed convection regime may be present which precludes the
   use of existing models developed for purely forced convection. In order
   to study flow and heat transfer in these situations, environmental
   conditions are precisely controlled in a test room to simulate
   situations that may occur in perimeter zones of buildings with glass
   curtain walls. Diffuser jets issuing from floor registers were shown to
   exhibit behavior not accounted for in existing heat transfer models.
   Results show that the movement of the jet issuing from floor registers
   is highly dependent on the mixed convection parameter Gr/Re-2 or
   Richardson number. Models are put forth to predict the movement of these
   jets, and the resulting heat transfer at walls or windows. When the
   effect of buoyancy forces is accounted for, models conform to a form
   used previously for turbulent forced convection. Three distinct flow
   regimes are identified and prescriptions are put forth for ensuring
   proper thermal control and accurate energy models. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cellular uplink analysis has typically been undertaken by either a
   simple approach that lumps all interference into a single deterministic
   or random parameter in a Wyner-type model, or via complex system level
   simulations that often do not provide insight into why various trends
   are observed. This paper proposes a novel middle way using point
   processes that is both accurate and also results in easy-to-evaluate
   integral expressions based on the Laplace transform of the interference.
   We assume mobiles and base stations are randomly placed in the network
   with each mobile pairing up to its closest base station. Compared to
   related recent work on downlink analysis, the proposed uplink model
   differs in two key features. First, dependence is considered between
   user and base station point processes to make sure each base station
   serves a single mobile in the given resource block. Second, per-mobile
   power control is included, which further couples the transmission of
   mobiles due to location-dependent channel inversion. Nevertheless, we
   succeed in deriving the coverage (equivalently outage) probability of a
   typical link in the network. This model can be used to address a wide
   variety of system design questions in the future. In this paper we focus
   on the implications for power control and show that partial channel
   inversion should be used at low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR), while full power transmission is optimal at higher SINR.}},

Abstract = {{For small cell technology to significantly increase the capacity of
   tower-based cellular networks, mobile users will need to be actively
   pushed onto the more lightly loaded tiers (corresponding to, e.g., pico
   and femtocells), even if they offer a lower instantaneous SINR than the
   macrocell base station (BS). Optimizing a function of the long-term rate
   for each user requires (in general) a massive utility maximization
   problem over all the SINRs and BS loads. On the other hand, an actual
   implementation will likely resort to a simple biasing approach where a
   BS in tier j is treated as having its SINR multiplied by a factor A(j)
   >= 1, which makes it appear more attractive than the heavily-loaded
   macrocell. This paper bridges the gap between these approaches through
   several physical relaxations of the network-wide association problem,
   whose solution is NP hard. We provide a low-complexity distributed
   algorithm that converges to a near-optimal solution with a theoretical
   performance guarantee, and we observe that simple per-tier biasing loses
   surprisingly little, if the bias values A(j) are chosen carefully.
   Numerical results show a large (3.5x) throughput gain for cell-edge
   users and a 2x rate gain for median users relative to a maximizing
   received power association.}},

Abstract = {{Most programming languages use monitors with explicit signals for
   synchronization in shared-memory programs. Requiring programmers to
   signal threads explicitly results in many concurrency bugs due to missed
   notifications, or notifications on wrong condition variables. In this
   paper, we describe an implementation of an automatic signaling monitor
   in Java called AutoSynch that eliminates such concurrency bugs by
   removing the burden of signaling from the programmer. We show that the
   belief that automatic signaling monitors are prohibitively expensive is
   wrong. For most problems, programs based on AutoSynch are almost as fast
   as those based on explicit signaling. For some, AutoSynch is even faster
   than explicit signaling because it never uses signalAll, whereas the
   programmers end up using signalAll with the explicit signal mechanism.
   AutoSynch achieves efficiency in synchronization based on three novel
   ideas. We introduce an operation called closure that enables the
   predicate evaluation in every thread, thereby reducing context switches
   during the execution of the program. Secondly, AutoSynch avoids
   signalAll by using a property called relay invariance that guarantees
   that whenever possible there is always at least one thread whose
   condition is true which has been signaled. Finally, AutoSynch uses a
   technique called predicate tagging to efficiently determine a thread
   that should be signaled. To evaluate the efficiency of AutoSynch, we
   have implemented many different well-known synchronization problems such
   as the producers/consumers problem, the readers/writers problems, and
   the dining philosophers problem. The results show that AutoSynch is
   almost as efficient as the explicit-signal monitor and even more
   efficient for some cases.}},

   residual stress pattern due to roller bending has been only recently
   identified. Its effects on the elasto-plastic behavior of curved members
   have not been studied sufficiently. In this paper, an in-depth study of
   the influence of such residual stresses is performed. Considering the
   residual stress pattern due to cold bending, interaction diagrams and
   buckling curves for cold bent steel arches are developed. The results
   are quantified and compared with those for hot-rolled and stress free
   members. This allows designers to appreciate the available margins of
   safety when using standard interaction equations and buckling curves for
   cold bent members. Furthermore, the results suggest the necessity for
   the development of buckling curves for cold bent members including
   initial imperfections.}},

Abstract = {{While there has been increasing studies of MoS2 and other
   two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting dichalcogenides on hard conventional
   substrates, experimental or analytical studies on flexible substrates
   has been very limited so far, even though these 2D crystals are
   understood to have greater prospects for flexible smart systems. In this
   article, we report detailed studies of MoS2 transistors on industrial
   plastic sheets. Transistor characteristics afford more than 100x
   improvement in the ON/OFF current ratio and 4x enhancement in mobility
   compared to previous flexible MoS2 devices. Mechanical studies reveal
   robust electronic properties down to a bending radius of 1 mm which is
   comparable to previous reports for flexible graphene transistors.
   Experimental investigation Identifies that crack formation in the
   dielectric is the responsible failure mechanism demonstrating that the
   mechanical properties of the dielectric layer Is critical for realizing
   flexible electronics that can accommodate high strain. Our uniaxial
   tensile tests have revealed that atomic-layer-deposited HfO2 and Al2O3
   films have very similar crack onset strain. However, crack propagation
   Is slower in HfO2 dielectric compared to Al2O3 dielectric, suggesting a
   subcritical fracture mechanism In the thin oxide films. Rigorous
   mechanics modeling provides guidance for achieving flexible MoS2
   transistors that are reliable at sub-mm bending radius.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic gold nanorods provide a convenient combination of
   properties, such as tunability of plasmon resonances and strong
   extinction cross sections in the near-infrared to red spectral region.
   These properties have created significant interest in the development of
   antibody conjugation methods for synthesis of targeted nanorods for a
   number of biomedical applications, including molecular specific imaging
   and therapy. Previously published conjugation approaches have achieved
   molecular specificity. However, the current conjugation methods have
   several downsides including low stability and potential cytotoxicity of
   bioconjugates that are produced by electrostatic interactions, as well
   as lack of control over antibody orientation during covalent
   conjugation. Here we addressed these shortcomings by introducing
   directional antibody conjugation to the gold nanorod surface. The
   directional conjugation is achieved through the carbohydrate moiety,
   which is located on one of the heavy chains of the Fc portion of most
   antibodies. The carbohydrate is oxidized under mild conditions to a
   hydrazide reactive aldehyde group. Then, a heterofunctional linker with
   hydrazide and dithiol groups is used to attach antibodies to gold
   nanorods. The directional conjugation approach was characterized using
   electron microscopy, zeta potential, and extinction spectra. We also
   determined spectral changes associated with nanorod aggregation; these
   spectral changes can be used as a convenient quality control of nanorod
   bioconjugates. Molecular specificity of the synthesized antibody
   targeted nanorods was demonstrated using hyperspectral, optical and
   photoacoustic imaging of cancer cell culture models. Additionally, we
   observed characteristic changes in optical spectra of molecular specific
   nanorods after their interactions with cancer cells; the observed
   spectral signatures can be explored for sensitive cancer detection.}},

Abstract = {{The cathodic reactions in Li-S batteries can be divided into two steps.
   Firstly, elemental sulfur is transformed into long-chain polysulfides
   (S8Li2S4), which are highly soluble in the electrolyte. Next, long-chain
   polysulfides undergo nucleation reaction and convert into solid-state
   Li2S2 and Li2S (Li2S4Li2S) by slow processes. As a result, the
   second-step of the electrochemical reaction hinders the high-rate
   application of Li-S batteries. In this report, the kinetics of the
   sulfur/long-chain-polysulfide redox couple (theoretical
   capacity=419mAhg-1) are experimentally demonstrated to be very fast in
   the Li-S system. A Li-S cell with a blended carbon interlayer retains
   excellent cycle stability and possesses a high percentage of active
   material utilization over 250cycles at high C rates. The
   meso-/micropores in the interlayer are responsible for accommodating the
   shuttling polysulfides and offering sufficient electrolyte
   accessibility. Therefore, utilizing the sulfur/long-chain polysulfide
   redox couple with an efficient interlayer configuration in Li-S
   batteries may be a promising choice for high-power applications.}},

Abstract = {{A novel parameter estimation algorithm is proposed. The inverse problem
   is formulated as a sequential data integration problem in which Gaussian
   process regression (GPR) is used to integrate the prior knowledge
   (static data). The search space is further parameterized using
   Karhunen-Loeve expansion to build a set of basis functions that spans
   the search space. Optimal weights of the reduced basis functions are
   estimated by an iterative stochastic ensemble method (ISEM). ISEM
   employs directional derivatives within a Gauss-Newton iteration for
   efficient gradient estimation. The resulting update equation relies on
   the inverse of the output covariance matrix which is rank deficient.
   In the proposed algorithm we use an iterative regularization based on
   the l(2) Boosting algorithm. l(2) Boosting iteratively fits the residual
   and the amount of regularization is controlled by the number of
   iterations. A termination criteria based on Akaike information criterion
   (AIC) is utilized. This regularization method is very attractive in
   terms of performance and simplicity of implementation. The proposed
   algorithm combining ISEM and l(2) Boosting is evaluated on several
   nonlinear subsurface flow parameter estimation problems. The efficiency
   of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the small size of utilized
   ensembles and in terms of error convergence rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Geophysical flows over complex domains often encompass both coarse and
   highly resolved regions. Approximating these flows using shock-capturing
   methods with explicit timestepping gives rise to a
   Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) timestep constraint. This approach can
   result in small global timesteps often dictated by flows in small
   regions, vastly increasing computational effort over the whole domain.
   One approach for coping with this problem is to use locally varying
   timesteps. In previous work, we formulated a local timestepping (LTS)
   method within a Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin framework and
   demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency of this method on serial
   machines for relatively small-scale shallow water applications. For more
   realistic models involving large domains and highly complex physics, the
   LTS method must be parallelized for multi-core parallel computers.
   Furthermore, additional physics such as strong wind forcing can effect
   the choice of local timesteps. In this paper, we describe a parallel LTS
   method, parallelized using domain decomposition and MPI. We demonstrate
   the method on tidal flows and hurricane storm surge applications in the
   coastal regions of the Western North Atlantic Ocean. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An intrinsic notion of quality floors present in typical digital signal
   processing circuits can be used to strategically accept some runtime
   errors in exchange for a reduction in energy consumption. Conventional
   very large scale integration design strategies do not exploit this
   degree of error tolerance and aim to guarantee timing correctness,
   thereby sacrificing energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose
   techniques for timing error acceptance to improve the quality-energy
   tradeoff in image and video processing systems under scaled V-DD. The
   basic philosophy is to prevent signal quality from severe degradation,
   on average, by using data statistics. The introduced innovations include
   techniques for carefully controlling possible errors and exploiting the
   specifics of error patterns for low-cost postprocessing to minimize
   quality degradation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   techniques on a 2-D inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) and a 2-D
   DCT design. The designs were synthesized using a 45-nm standard cell
   library, with energy and delay evaluated using NanoSim and VCS.
   Experiments show that direct applications of controlled error-acceptance
   techniques allow up to 59\% and 71\% energy savings by permitting fewer
   than 1-dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) decrease for the 2-D IDCT
   and DCT designs, respectively. The resulting PSNR remains above 30 dB,
   which is a commonly accepted value for lossy image and video
   compression. Achieving such energy savings by direct V-DD scaling
   without the proposed transformations results in a 12-dB PSNR loss. The
   area overhead for the needed control logic is about 4.8\% of the
   original design. To further minimize quality degradation caused by
   accepted errors in the IDCT, we introduce postfiltering on the output
   image. The significant improvement of the perceived image quality allows
   further voltage scaling leading to overall energy savings of 70\% for
   the 2-D IDCT, while costing an additional 1.1\% in area.}},

Abstract = {{We propose two scheduling algorithms that seek to optimize the quality
   of scalably coded videos that have been stored at a video server before
   transmission. The first scheduling algorithm is derived from a Markov
   decision process (MDP) formulation developed here. We model the dynamics
   of the channel as a Markov chain and reduce the problem of dynamic video
   scheduling to a tractable Markov decision problem over a finite-state
   space. Based on the MDP formulation, a near-optimal scheduling policy is
   computed that minimizes the mean square error. Using insights taken from
   the development of the optimal MDP-based scheduling policy, the second
   proposed scheduling algorithm is an online scheduling method that only
   requires easily measurable knowledge of the channel dynamics, and is
   thus viable in practice. Simulation results show that the performance of
   both scheduling algorithms is close to a performance upper bound also
   derived in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{We consider information dissemination in a large n-user wireless network
   in which k users wish to share a unique message with all other users.
   Each of the n users only has knowledge of its own contents and state
   information; this corresponds to a one-sided push-only scenario. The
   goal is to disseminate all messages efficiently, hopefully achieving an
   order-optimal spreading rate over unicast wireless random networks.
   First, we show that a random-push strategy-where a user sends its own or
   a received packet at random-is order-wise suboptimal in a random
   geometric graph: specifically, Omega(root n) times slower than optimal
   spreading. It is known that this gap can be closed if each user has
   ``full{''} mobility, since this effectively creates a complete graph. We
   instead consider velocity-constrained mobility where at each time slot
   the user moves locally using a discrete random walk with velocity v(n)
   that is much lower than full mobility. We propose a simple two-stage
   dissemination strategy that alternates between individual message
   flooding ({''}self promotion{''}) and random gossiping. We prove that
   this scheme achieves a close to optimal spreading rate (within only a
   logarithmic gap) as long as the velocity is at least v(n) = omega(root
   log n/k). The key insight is that the mixing property introduced by the
   partial mobility helps users to spread in space within a relatively
   short period compared to the optimal spreading time, which
   macroscopically mimics message dissemination over a complete graph.}},

Abstract = {{Graphite oxide (GO) was modified using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
   (APTES) to investigate the impact of dispersion and interfacial bonding
   on the mechanical properties of reinforced silicone elastomer, poly
   (dimethylsiloxane), PDMS. Although a 71\% enhancement of Young's modulus
   was observed (comparable to thermoplastics) at a loading of 3.0 wt\%
   APTES-modified GO (A-GO), the observed enhancement factor is just 8\% of
   that expected for randomly dispersed perfect graphene sheets. We
   attribute this less-than-ideal enhancement to crumping and break-up of
   the graphene sheets caused by ultrasonic dispersion. In the absence of
   TEOS crosslinker, the A-GO PDMS melt does not solidify so modulus
   enhancement is not due to crosslinking through the APTES-modified filler
   particles. Modulus enhancement due to rubber-like elasticity of the
   filler itself, however, may be active. Characterization indicates that
   amino groups are chemically attached to the surface of GO in A-GO. The
   improved dispersibility enhances the toughness, but only at low
   loadings. In fact, at 3-wt\% loading the toughness is less than that of
   pure PDMS due to loss of elongation caused by filler aggregation. (C)

Abstract = {{The random-vibration theory (RVT) approach to equivalent-linear
   site-response analysis is often used to simulate site amplification,
   particularly when large numbers of simulations are required for
   incorporation into probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis. The fact that
   RVT site-response analysis does not require the specification of
   input-time series makes it an attractive alternative to other
   site-response methods. However, some studies have indicated that the
   site amplification predicted by RVT site-response analysis
   systematically differs from that predicted by time-series approaches.
   This study confirms that RVT site-response analysis predicts site
   amplification at the natural site frequencies as much as 20\%-50\%
   larger than time-series analysis, with the largest overprediction
   occurring for sites with smaller natural frequencies and sites underlain
   by hard rock. The overprediction is caused by an increase in duration
   generated by the site response, which is not taken into account in the
   RVT calculation. Correcting for this change in duration brings the RVT
   results within 20\% of the time-series results. A similar duration
   effect is observed for the RVT shear-strain calculation used to estimate
   the equivalent-linear strain-compatible soil properties. An alternative
   to applying a duration correction to improve the agreement between RVT
   and time-series analysis is the modeling of shear-wave velocity
   variability. It is shown that introducing shear-wave velocity
   variability through Monte Carlo simulation brings the RVT results
   consistently within +/- 20\% of the time-series results.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, modifications were made to previously applied two-zone
   models to address important factors that can affect exposures during
   cleaning tasks. Specifically, we expand on previous applications of the
   two-zone model by (1) introducing the source in discrete elements
   (source-cells) as opposed to a complete instantaneous release, (2)
   placing source cells in both the inner (near person) and outer zones
   concurrently, (3) treating each source cell as an independent mixture of
   multiple constituents, and (4) tracking the time-varying liquid
   concentration and emission rate of each constituent in each source cell.
   Three experiments were performed in an environmentally controlled
   chamber with a thermal mannequin and a simplified pure chemical source
   to simulate emissions from a cleaning product. Gas phase concentration
   measurements were taken in the bulk air and in the breathing zone of the
   mannequin to evaluate the model. The mean ratio of the integrated
   concentration in the mannequin's breathing zone to the concentration in
   the outer zone was 4.3 (standard deviation, sigma = 1.6). The mean ratio
   of measured concentration in the breathing zone to predicted
   concentrations in the inner zone was 0.81 (sigma = 0.16). Intake
   fractions ranged from 1.9 x 10(-3) to 2.7 x 10(-3). Model results
   reasonably predict those of previous exposure monitoring studies and
   indicate the inadequacy of well-mixed single-zone model applications for
   some but not all cleaning events. {[}Supplementary materials are

Abstract = {{The acoustic properties of kelp forests are not well known, but are of
   interest for the development of environmental remote sensing
   applications. This study examined the low-frequency (0.2-4.5 kHz)
   acoustic properties of three species of kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera,
   Egregia menziessi, and Laminaria solidungula) using a one-dimensional
   acoustic resonator. Acoustic observations and measurements of kelp
   morphology were then used to test the validity of Wood's multi-phase
   medium model in describing the acoustic behavior of the kelp. For
   Macrocystis and Egregia, the two species of kelp possessing
   pneumatocysts, the change in sound speed was highly dependent on the
   volume of free air contained in the kelp. The volume of air alone,
   however, was unable to predict the effective sound speed of the
   multi-phase medium using a simple two-phase (air + water) form of Wood's
   model. A separate implementation of this model (frond + water)
   successfully yielded the acoustic compressibility of the frond structure
   for each species (Macrocystis = 1.39 +/- 0.82 x 10(-8) Pa-1; Egregia =
   2.59 +/- 5.75 x 10(-9) Pa-1; Laminaria = 8.65 +/- 8.22 x 10(-9) Pa-1).
   This investigation demonstrates that the acoustic characteristics of
   kelp are species-specific, biomass-dependent, and differ between species
   with and without pneumatocyst structures. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{Air-driven vocal production systems such as those found in mammals,
   birds, and anurans (frogs and toads) combine pneumatic and mechanical
   elements in species-specific ways to produce a diversity of
   communication signals. This study uses bond graphs to model a
   generalized anuran vocal production system. Bond graphs allow an
   incremental approach to modeling dynamic physical systems involving
   different domains. Anurans provide an example of how signal diversity
   results from variation in the structure and behavior of vocal system
   elements. This paper first proposes a bond graph model of the integrated
   anuran vocal system as a framework for future study. It then presents a
   simulated submodel of the anuran sound source that produces sustained
   oscillations in vocal fold displacement and air flow through the larynx.
   The modeling approach illustrated here should prove of general
   applicability to other biological sound production systems, and will
   allow researchers to study the biomechanics of vocal production as well
   as the functional congruence and evolution of groups of traits within
   integrated vocal systems. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Title = {{New Analytical and Statistical Approach for Estimating and Analyzing
   Sand Production Through Plain Square-Mesh Screens During a

Abstract = {{There are two types of sand-retention tests (SRTs) generally used in the
   industry to evaluate the performance of sand-control screens for
   standalone-screen (SAS) applications-prepack tests and slurry tests.
   They represent complete hole collapse and gradual rock failure around
   the wellbore, respectively.
   In this paper, we present analytical models and Monte Carlo (MC)
   simulations to estimate sand production in slurry-type SRTs with
   square-mesh screens while taking into account the full particle-size
   distribution (PSD) of the formation sand. We also compare the model
   results with four sets of experimental data and demonstrate that this
   approach can be used to predict sand production for different
   sand-size-distribution/screen-size combinations without the need for
   physical tests (provided that both an accurate representation of the
   formation-sand PSD and an accurate representation of screen pore sizes
   are available). This work augments previously published slurry-test
   models that were limited to wire-wrapped screens (WWSs), and enables the
   comparison of the performance of square-mesh screens with WWSs.
   The analytical model and the MC simulations provide a direct and
   reliable way to estimate the amount of sand that will be produced for a
   given sand-size distribution and a given screen size. Because the
   proposed methods are much more quantitative, they represent a
   significant improvement that surpasses current methods that rely on
   single design points or rules of thumb for screen selection.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of surfactant/polymer (SP) flooding is to reduce interfacial
   tension (IFT)between oil and water so that residual oil is mobilized and
   high recovery is achieved. The optimal salinity and optimal
   solubilization ratios that correspond to ultralow IFT have recently been
   shown, in some cases, to be a strong function of the methane mole
   fraction in the oil at reservoir pressure. We incorporate a recently
   developed methodology to determine the optimal salinity and
   solubilization ratio at reservoir pressure into a chemical-flooding
   simulator (UTCHEM). The proposed method determines the optimal
   conditions on the basis of density estimates by use of a cubic equation
   of state (EOS) and measured phase-behavior data at atmospheric pressure.
   The microemulsion phase-behavior (Winsor I, II, and III) are adjusted on
   the basis of this predicted optimal salinity and solubilization ratio in
   the simulator. Parameters for the surfactant phase-behavior equation are
   modified to account for these changes, and the trend in the equivalent
   alkane carbon number (EACN) is automatically adjusted for pressure and
   methane content in each simulation gridblock. We use phase-behavior data
   from several potential SP floods to demonstrate the new implementation.
   The implementation of the new phase-behavior model into a
   chemical-flooding simulator allows for a better design of SP floods and
   more-accurate estimations of oil recovery. The new approach could also
   be used to handle free gas that may form in the reservoir; however, the
   SP-flood simulation when free gas is present is not the focus of this
   paper. We show that not accounting for the phase-behavior changes that
   occur when methane is present at reservoir pressure can greatly affect
   the oil recovery of SP floods. Improper design of an SP flood can lead
   to production of more oil as a microemulsion phase than as an oil bank.
   This paper describes the procedure to implement the effect of pressure
   and solution gas on microemulsion phase behavior in a chemical-flooding
   simulator, which requires the phase-behavior data measured at
   atmospheric pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Decision analysis is often employed in portfolio management. The
   portfolio management process consists primarily of valuation (including
   uncertainty quantification or risk assessment) and
   prioritization/selection, which are based on the results of valuation.
   In this paper, we quantify the relative value of these components using
   a value of information (VOI) framework. Specifically, we quantify the
   VOI that stems from the ability to better prioritize projects and the
   VOI that comes from the ability to exclude projects. We identify
   conditions under which prioritization is the primary value driver in

Abstract = {{The immunoglobulin lambda (IGL) repertoires from two unrelated human
   blood samples, three NOD-scid-IL2R gamma(null) mice engrafted with human
   hematopoietic stem cells and two pairs of monozygotic twin blood samples
   were determined by Roche 454 sequencing to generate a total of about 700
   000 IGL sequences. We applied bioinformatic analysis to examine IGL
   repertoires wherein, surprisingly, >= 20\% of CDR-L3 peptide sequences
   were `public' (shared across individuals); moreover, full-length IGL
   protein sequences (VJ recombinants) were also present in the public
   domain. Subtle yet significant differences in CDR-L3 nontemplated
   nucleotide addition, IGL V-gene family usage, and amino-acid composition
   distinguished the public CDR-L3 groups from the private groups. These
   data suggest that public CDR-L3 intervals can arise by intrinsic genetic
   mechanisms irrespective of different B-cell developmental milieu (human
   versus humanized mouse). Furthermore, the occurrence of identical public
   IGL protein sequences indirectly suggest the positive selection
   (evolutionary, somatic or both) of particular IGL chains independent of
   the immunoglobulin heavy chain.}},
