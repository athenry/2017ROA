Abstract = {{Adverse weather poses a significant threat to transportation safety.
   Road weather information systems (RWIS) are used to mitigate the impact
   of adverse weather. Because of the lack of detailed, unified guidelines
   and because of diverse weather conditions across the United States,
   state and city transportation agencies follow different practices for
   choosing locations for environmental sensor stations. This paper
   proposes a comprehensive cell-based methodology that optimizes overall
   benefits of RWIS based on weather-sensitive crash characterizations and
   using both normal and adverse weather crash data. The proposed approach
   is especially suited to optimizing regionwide environmental sensor
   station locations involving many road segments. A case study concerning
   RWIS deployment in Austin, Texas, was conducted with data from a crash
   records information system for 2010 to 2013.}},

   Building Information Modeling that was developed to educate the next
   generation construction managers to understand BIM and effectively use
   an existing BIM in plan execution for construction projects. This is a
   project-based course where students gain knowledge on the implementation
   of BIM concepts throughout the lifecycle of a project. Findings and

Abstract = {{Several explanations can be found in the literature about the origin of
   colorectal cancer. There is, however, some agreement on the fact that
   the carcinogenic process is a result of several genetic mutations of
   normal cells. The colon epithelium is characterized by millions of
   invaginations, very small cavities, called crypts, where most of the
   cellular activity occurs. It is agreed in the medical community that a
   potential first manifestation of the carcinogenic process, observed in
   conventional colonoscopy images, is the appearance of aberrant crypt
   foci (ACF). These are clusters of abnormal crypts, morphologically
   characterized by an atypical behavior of the cells that populate the
   crypts. In this work a homogenization model is proposed for representing
   the cellular dynamics in the colon epithelium. The goal is to simulate
   and predict, in silico, the spread and evolution of ACF, as it can be
   observed in colonoscopy images. By assuming that the colon is a
   heterogeneous medium, exhibiting a periodic distribution of crypts, we
   start this work by describing a periodic model that represents the ACF
   cell-dynamics in a two-dimensional setting. Then, homogenization
   techniques are applied to this periodic model to find a simpler model,
   whose solution symbolizes the averaged behavior of ACF at the tissue
   level. Some theoretical results concerning the existence of solution of
   the homogenized model are proved, applying a fixed point theorem.
   Numerical results showing the convergence of the periodic model to the
   homogenized model are presented.}},

   Masonry Wall Structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the shake-table tests of a full-scale, two-story,
   reinforced masonry shear-wall structure designed by a displacement-based
   method. The test structure had two T-sectioned and one
   rectangular-sectioned wall components along the direction of the table
   motion, and four rectangular-sectioned wall components in the orthogonal
   direction. The structure was subjected to a series of dynamic tests with
   a historical ground motion record scaled to intensity levels up to that
   of the maximum considered earthquake (MCE). The structure formed a
   soft-story mechanism during the last test. The recorded displacements
   were within the target limits for the design earthquake-level table
   motion, but exceeded the target limits for the MCE level. Although the
   structure experienced severe damage and incurred diagonal cracking in
   wall components with low aspect ratios, it did not collapse. The
   comparison of the analysis results to the test results shows that the
   walls in the orthogonal direction had a significant contribution to the
   lateral load resistance of the structure as they exerted axial
   compression through the horizontal diaphragms and lintels on the wall
   components parallel to the loading direction when the latter rocked. For
   this structure, the conventional force-based design method could result
   in unsatisfactory performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the shake-table tests of a full-scale, 3-story,
   reinforced concrete masonry structure. The structure was a special
   reinforced masonry shear wall system designed according to current code
   provisions for an area of high seismicity. It consisted of three lines
   of walls arranged in an H-shape in plan view, with one lineal and two
   T-walls aligned in the direction of the table motion and four lineal
   walls oriented perpendicular to the table motion. The seven walls were
   separated by door openings and were connected with lintels and precast
   slabs with cast-in-place concrete topping. The structure was subjected
   to a series of dynamic tests including nine seismic excitations with
   intensities exceeding the maximum considered earthquake used in the
   design. The structure had a capacity that exceeded considerably the
   design base shear, and it withstood all but the last two excitations
   with little or no damage. The paper presents the design of the test
   structure, its dynamic response to the seismic excitations, the
   evolution of damage, and the major observations and findings from the
   tests, including the influence of the concrete slabs, lintels, location
   of lap splices, and walls oriented perpendicular to the direction of the
   table motion on the structural performance.}},

Title = {{Segmental dynamics in lamellar phases of tapered copolymers}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{7818-7823}},
Abstract = {{Recent experiments have reported that the lamellar phase of salt-doped
   tapered copolymers exhibit higher ionic conductivity compared to those
   seen in similar morphologies of diblock copolymers. Such observations
   were in turn rationalized by invoking the corresponding glass transition
   temperature of the segregated copolymers. In this work we report the
   results of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to identify the
   mechanisms underlying such characteristics. Explicitly, we probe the
   combined influences of the degree of segregation and the disparity in
   mobilities of the segments of the two blocks, upon the local relaxation
   dynamics of tapered copolymers segregated in lamellar phases. Our
   results show that the local dynamics of tapered copolymers depend on two
   independent factors, viz., the degree of segregation of such copolymers
   relative to their order-disorder transition temperature, and the
   relative mobilities (glass transition temperatures) of the two blocks.
   In qualitative correspondence with experiments, we find that for
   appropriate combinations of mobility ratios and degree of segregation,
   the lamellar phases of tapered copolymers can exhibit faster local
   segmental dynamics compared to diblock copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{We have derived an axially symmetric three-dimensional analytical
   solution for thermoelastic deformations and stresses in a layered medium
   irradiated by a laser beam. The solution was obtained for Gaussian
   radial temperature profile on the upper surface of the elastic layer, in
   the assumption that temperature decreases exponentially with depth. The
   developed theoretical model was used to calculate distributions of
   laser-induced deformations and displacements in a medium containing
   single layer over a half-space. The influence of the shear elastic
   properties of the layer and half-space on the stress and strain
   distributions was evaluated. It was shown that tissue response depends
   significantly on the elastic contrast between the layer and the
   half-space. The proposed solution could be used in photomechanical
   models of laser ablation of inhomogeneous materials and tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Wave models, which have been utilized in the past to reconstruct corneal
   biomechanical properties based on the propagation of an elastic wave,
   were often developed assuming a thin-plate geometry. However, the
   curvature and thickness of the cornea are not considered when utilizing
   these models. In this work, optical coherence elastography (OCE)
   experiments were conducted on tissue-mimicking agar phantoms and contact
   lenses along with finite element (FE) modeling of four kinds of
   cornea-like structures to understand the effects of curvature and
   thickness on the group velocity of an elastic wave. As the radius of
   curvature increased from 19.1 to 47.7 mm, the group velocity of the
   elastic wave obtained by both FE and OCE from a spherical shell section
   model decreased from similar to 2.8 m/s to similar to 2.2 m/s. When the
   thickness of the agar phantom increased from 1.9 mm to 5.6 mm, the
   elastic wave velocity increased from similar to 3.0 m/s to similar to
   4.1 m/s. Both the FE and OCE results show that the group velocity of the
   elastic wave decreased with radius of curvature but increased with
   thickness. Therefore, the curvature and thickness must be considered
   when developing accurate wave models for quantifying biomechanical
   properties of the cornea.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we have evaluated the elastic anisotropy of porcine
   corneas with increasing intraocular pressures (IOPs) using a noncontact
   optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique. A focused air-pulse
   induced low amplitude (<= 10 mu m) elastic waves in fresh porcine
   corneas (n=9) in situ in the whole eye-globe configuration. A
   phase-stabilized swept source optical coherence elastography (PhS-SSOCE)
   system imaged the propagation of the elastic wave in different stepped
   radial directions. A closed-loop feedback system was utilized to
   artificially manipulate the IOP, and OCE measurements were repeated
   while the IOP was increased in 5 mmHg increments from 15 to 30 mmHg. The
   OCE measurements demonstrated that the elastic anisotropy of the cornea
   became more pronounced at higher IOPs, and that there were distinct
   radial angles of higher and lower stiffness. The presented noncontact
   OCE method was capable of detecting and assessing the corneal elastic
   anisotropy as a function of IOP. Due to the noninvasive nature and small
   amplitude of the elastic wave, this method may be able to provide
   additional information about corneal health and integrity in vivo.}},

Title = {{Demand response control of residential HVAC loads based on dynamic
   electricity prices and economic analysis}},

Abstract = {{During peak hours, electrical loads of residential HVAC systems can
   cause imbalance between electricity supply and demand. Demand response
   control has the potential to facilitate supply-demand balance. The
   demand side load control can help reduce electricity consumption through
   demand response programs. Since HVAC loads are the major contributors to
   peak loads, reducing HVAC load at peak hours is an objective of many
   demand response technologies. This article analyzes performance of the
   dynamic thermostat controller of HVAC systems in homes that have dynamic
   price of electricity. Based on a price signal, the dynamic thermostat
   controller sets back the thermostat temperature to save electricity
   consumption and costs. The consumers choose participation in the demand
   response program based on the real-time price of electricity and set a
   threshold price that the thermostat uses to set the temperature during
   peak power price period. The performance of dynamic thermostat
   controller was analyzed for two cities, Austin TX and Chicago IL, and
   historical market price data were used to generate hourly based
   real-time price. In addition to different climate zones, two different
   types of residential buildings were modeled. Based on detailed energy
   simulation, the changes in HVAC system operation were analyzed when
   considering electric energy saving, peak power reduction, cost saving,
   as well as the potential thermal discomfort. The specific results show
   that dynamic pricing combined with dynamic thermostat controller results
   in 12\% annual energy cost savings for HVAC operation with the energy
   saving of up to 6\%, but without significantly changing the thermal
   comfort.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{1866-1876}},
Abstract = {{Microbubbles are widely used as contrast agents to improve the
   diagnostic capability of conventional, highly speckled, low-contrast
   ultrasound imaging. However, while microbubbles can be used for
   molecular imaging, these agents are limited to the vascular space due to
   their large size (> 1 mu m). Smaller microbubbles are desired but their
   ultrasound visualization is limited due to lower echogenicity or higher
   resonant frequencies. Here we present nanometer scale, phase changing,
   blinking nanocapsules (BLInCs), which can be repeatedly optically
   triggered to provide transient contrast and enable background-free
   ultrasound imaging. In response to irradiation by near-infrared laser
   pulses, the BLInCs undergo cycles of rapid vaporization followed by
   recondensation into their native liquid state at body temperature. High
   frame rate ultrasound imaging measures the dynamic echogenicity changes
   associated with these controllable, periodic phase transitions. Using a
   newly developed image processing algorithm, the blinking particles are
   distinguished from tissue, providing a background-free image of the
   BLInCs while the underlying B-mode ultrasound image is used as an
   anatomical reference of the tissue. We demonstrate the function of
   BLInCs and the associated imaging technique in a tissue-mimicking
   phantom and in vivo for the identification of the sentinel lymph node.
   Our studies indicate that BLInCs may become a powerful tool to identify
   biological targets using a conventional ultrasound imaging system.}},

Abstract = {{Most stereoscopic 3D (S3D) image visual discomfort predictors use the
   Support Vector Regressor (SVR) as the regression model. However, there
   are other good regression models such as the Random Forests (RF) and

   these regression models for S3D image visual discomfort prediction. We
   deployed several regression models to predict the visual discomfort
   scores on S3D images using three kinds of features extracted from the
   images in the IEEE-SA and EPFL S3D image databases. So the prediction
   performance was evaluated to compare the performance of the different
   regression models. We also studied the issue of over-fitting which can
   affect model performance. The comparison results show that it is
   feasible and reliable to apply Random Forests or GBRT for S3D visual
   discomfort prediction with better performance than SVR.}},

Abstract = {{The planar motion of a particle within an arbitrary potential field is
   considered. The particle is additionally subject to an external force
   wherein the applied thrust-acceleration is constrained to remain normal
   to the velocity vector. The system is thus non-conservative but since
   the thrust force is non-working, the total energy is a conserved
   quantity. Under this setting, a major result of fundamental importance
   is established in this paper: that the flight direction angle (more
   precisely, the sine of the angle between the position and velocity
   vectors) is shown to always satisfy a linear first-order differential
   equation with variable coefficients that depend upon the underlying
   potential function. As a consequence, an analytical solution for the
   flight direction angle can be obtained directly in terms of the
   particle's distance from the center of the field for a significant
   number of special cases for the potential function. In the case of J(2)
   perturbed spacecraft motion within equatorial orbits, the problem is
   reduced to that of solving an incomplete elliptic integral. Another
   important implication of the main result established here is that motion
   problems subject to velocity-normal thrusting can always be reduced to
   the study of equivalent single degree-of-freedom conservative systems
   with an effective potential function. The paper concludes with various
   examples of both academic and practical interest including the study of
   bounded two-body Keplerian orbits and hodograph interpretetions}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach for estimating
   plant-model mismatch for linear MIMO systems operating under constrained
   MPC. We begin with analyzing the closed-loop plant data; under the
   assumption that changes in the active set of constraints of the
   controller are due to (low frequency) setpoint, changes, we separate the
   data into a finite number of fixed active set (PAS) subsets, each of
   which features a time-invariant active set of MPC constraints. We
   establish an explicit relationship relating the magnitude of plant-model
   mismatch to the autocovariance of the system output in the FAS case,
   while accounting for changes in the setpoint value. The mismatch
   estimation problem is then formulated as a global optimization
   calculation, aimed at minimizing the discrepancy between the
   antocovariance estimated using this theoretical tool, and the
   autocovariance of plant outputs computed from operating data for each
   PAS subset,. A chemical process case study is presented to illustrate
   the effectiveness of the approach. (C) 2016, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{Maximizing the benefits of time-of-use pricing for industrial
   electricity consumers requires varying production rates, such that
   energy use is shifted from peak price periods to off-peak times dining
   the day. Assuming that excess capacity and product storage arc
   available, production of energy intensive processes can be increased at
   off-peak times beyond nominal rates, and the stored product can be used
   at peak times when the production rate is lowered. Under these rapidly
   changing circumstances, scheduling calculations must take into
   consideration explicitly the dynamic model of the process, often
   rendering the scheduling problem intractable in practical amounts of
   time. To address this challenge, we introduce a class of
   scheduling-relevant low-order process models, which capture the
   closed-loop input-output behavior of a plant. We use these models to
   close the scheduling loop, whereby the scheduling problem is formulated
   over a moving horizon with feedback. We apply the theoretical concepts
   to an industrial-scale air separation unit model, demonstrating that
   variable production rate operation with product storage has the
   potential for significant operating cost savings while abiding by
   product quality and safety constraints. (C) 2016, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{Geometric programming (GP) is popular for use in equation-based
   optimization of analog circuits thanks to GP-compatible analog
   performance functions, and its convexity, hence computational
   tractability. The main challenge in using GP, and thus a roadblock to
   wider use and adoption, is the mismatch between what GP can accurately
   fit, and the behavior of many common device/circuit functions.
   In this paper, we leverage recent tools from sums-of-squares, moment
   optimization, and semidefinite optimization (SDP), in order to present a
   novel and powerful extension to address the monomial inaccuracy: fitting
   device models as higher-order monomials, defined as the exponential
   functions of polynomials in the logarithmic variables.
   By the introduction of high-order monomials, the original GP problems
   become polynomial geometric programming (PolyGP) problems with
   non-linear and non-convex objective and constraints. Our PolyGP
   framework allows significant improvements in model accuracy when
   symbolic performance functions in terms of device models are present.
   Via SDP-relaxations inspired by polynomial optimization (POP), we can
   obtain efficient near-optimal global solutions to the resulting PolyGP.
   Experimental results through established circuits show that compared to
   GP, we are able to reduce fitting error of device models to 3.5\% from
   10.5\% on average. Hence, the fitting error of performance functions
   decrease from 12\% of GP and 9\% of POP, to 3\% accordingly. This
   translates to the ability of identifying superior solution points and
   the dramatic decrease of constraint violation in contrast to both GP and
   POP.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we assess the past, present, and future of mobile CPU
   design. We study how mobile CPU designs trends have impacted the
   end-user, hardware design, and the holistic mobile device. We analyze
   the evolution of ten cutting-edge mobile CPU designs released over the
   past seven years. Specifically, we report measured performance, power,
   energy and user satisfaction trends across mobile CPU generations.
   A key contribution of our work is that we contextualize the mobile CPU's
   evolution in terms of user satisfaction, which has largely been absent
   from prior mobile hardware studies. To bridge the gap between mobile CPU
   design and user satisfaction, we construct and conduct a novel
   crowdsourcing study that spans over 25,000 survey participants using the
   Amazon Mechanical Turk service. Our methodology allows us to identify
   what mobile CPU design techniques provide the most benefit to the
   end-user's quality of user experience.
   Our results quantitatively demonstrate that CPUs play a crucial role in
   modern mobile system-on-chips (SoCs). Over the last seven years, both
   single-and multicore performance improvements have contributed to
   end-user satisfaction by reducing user-critical application response
   latencies. Mobile CPUs aggressively adopted many power-hungry
   desktoporiented design techniques to reach these performance levels.
   Unlike other smartphone components (e.g. display and radio) whose peak
   power consumption has decreased over time, the mobile CPU's peak power
   consumption has steadily increased.
   As the limits of technology scaling restrict the ability of desktop-like
   scaling to continue for mobile CPUs, specialized accelerators appear to
   be a promising alternative that can help sustain the power, performance,
   and energy improvements that mobile computing necessitates. Such a
   paradigm shift will redefine the role of the CPU within future SoCs,
   which merit several design considerations based on our findings.}},

Abstract = {{A low loss and high sensitivity X-band RF sensor based on electro-optic
   (EO) polymer filled silicon slot photonic crystal waveguides (PCW) and
   bowtie antenna is proposed. By taking advantage of the slow light
   enhancementt in the PCW(> 20X), large EO coefficient of the EO
   polymer(r(33)> 200pm/V), as well as significant electric field
   enhancement of bowtie antenna on silicon dioxide substrate(> 10000X), we
   can realize a large in-device EO coefficient over 1000pm/V so as to
   realize a high performance RF wave sensor. In addition, on-chip
   Mach-Zender interferometer (MZI) layout working under push-pull
   configuration is adopted to further increase the sensitivity of the
   sensor. Furthermore, inverse taper couplers and slotted photonic crystal
   waveguides are carefully designed and discussed in this paper to reduce
   the insertion loss of the device so as to increase the device
   signal-to-noise ratio. The minimum detectable electromagnetic power
   density is pushed down to 2.05 mW/m(2), corresponding to a minimum
   sensing electric field of 0.61 V/m. This photonic RF sensor has several
   important advantages over conventional electronics RF sensors based on
   electrical scheme including high data throughput, compact in size, and
   great immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI).}},

Abstract = {{Phased-array antenna (PAA) technology plays a significant role in modern
   day radar and communication networks. True-time-delay (TTD) enabled beam
   steering networks provide several advantages over their electronic
   counterparts, including squint-free beam steering, low RF loss, immunity
   to electromagnetic interference (EMI), and large bandwidth control of
   PAAs. Chip-scale and integrated TTD modules promise a miniaturized,
   light-weight system; however, the modules are still rigid and they
   require complex packaging solutions. Moreover, the total achievable time
   delay is still restricted by the wafer size. In this work, we propose a
   light-weight and large-area, true-time-delay beamforming network that
   can be fabricated on light-weight and flexible/rigid surfaces utilizing
   low-cost ``printing{''} techniques. In order to prove the feasibility of
   the approach, a 2-bit thermo-optic polymer TTD network is developed
   using a combination of imprinting and ink-jet printing. RF beam steering
   of a 1x4 X-band PAA up to 60 degrees is demonstrated. The development of
   such active components on large area, light-weight, and low-cost
   substrates promises significant improvement in size, weight, and power
   (SWaP) requirements over the state-of-the-art.}},

Title = {{Fairness and Efficiency Considerations in Performance-Based, Cross-Asset
   Resource Allocation}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2596}},
Pages = {{19-27}},
Abstract = {{Resource allocation mechanisms have become a major issue for
   transportation agencies in the United States and around the world. For
   this reason, agencies are exploring alternatives to modify traditional
   allocation mechanisms because of budgetary challenges generated by the
   decrease in funding and the increasing cost of preserving and operating
   transportation systems. Transportation asset management (TAM) practices
   enable agencies to change operations from the traditional efficiency
   mechanisms to more business-oriented structures. One of the main
   concerns with the TAM framework and its implementation is the absence of
   an organized process for cross-asset resource allocation. In addition,
   most alternative methods for funding allocation focus on maximizing
   infrastructure performance but ignore the consideration of equity.
   Equity considerations often influence allocation decisions; therefore,
   the impact on equity should be considered in funding allocation
   mechanisms. This paper presents a methodological framework for
   performance-based, cross-asset resource allocation toward a data
   oriented approach to enhancing infrastructure management. A multi
   objective optimization formulation that integrates efficiency and
   fairness considerations was used to develop the resource allocation
   model. Fairness considerations were incorporated with utility and envy
   concepts, and efficiency was introduced by maximizing overall asset
   performance. Two asset groups pavements and bridges from the roadway
   network of the Austin District in Texas were used to demonstrate the
   applicability of the proposed methodological framework.}},

Title = {{Management of a Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicle Fleet Implications of
   Pricing Schemes}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2572}},
Pages = {{37-46}},
Abstract = {{The market potential of a fleet of shared autonomous electric vehicles
   (SAEVs) is explored by using a multinomial logit mode choice model in an
   agent-based framework and different fare settings. The mode share of
   SAEVs in the simulated midsize city (modeled roughly after Austin,
   Texas) is predicted to lie between 14\% and 39\% when the SAEVs compete
   with privately owned, manually driven vehicles and city bus service. The
   underlying assumptions are that SAEVs are priced between \$0.75/mi and
   \$1.00/mi, which delivers significant net revenues to the fleet owner
   operator under all modeled scenarios; that they have an 80-mi range and
   that Level 2 charging infrastructure is available; and that automation
   costs are up to \$25,000 per vehicle. Various dynamic pricing schemes
   for SAEV fares indicate that specific fleet metrics can be improved with
   targeted strategies. For example, pricing strategies that attempt to
   balance available SAEV supply with anticipated trip demand can decrease
   average wait times by 19\% to 23\%. However, trade-offs exist within
   this price setting: fare structures that favor higher revenue-to-cost
   ratios by targeting travelers with a high value of travel time (VOTT)
   reduce SAEV mode shares, while those that favor larger mode shares by
   appealing to a wider VOTT range produce lower payback.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrous structures are an integral and dynamic feature of soft

   Histology and other nonoptical techniques have traditionally dominated
   the field of tissue imaging, but they are limited by their invasiveness,
   inability to provide resolution on the micrometer scale, and dynamic
   information. Recent advances in optical modalities can provide higher
   resolution, less invasive imaging capabilities, and more quantitative
   measurements. Here we describe contemporary optical imaging techniques
   with respect to their suitability in the imaging of tissue structure,
   with a focus on characterization and implementation into subsequent

Title = {{Analytical Approach to Estimate Feeder Accommodation Limits Based on
   Protection Criteria}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{4066-4081}},
Abstract = {{Widespread deployment of large-scale photovoltaics (PVs) and energy
   storage systems (ESSs) in distribution networks necessitates the
   development of methods to assess their possible system impacts. One of
   the primary concerns related to the integration of these systems is
   short-circuit overcurrent protection problems. Present techniques use
   simulations of full and detailed distribution circuit models with a
   large number of scenarios to estimate the PV and ESS sizes a
   distribution feeder can accommodate without causing adverse impacts. As
   this process requires considerable time and effort, this paper develops
   a practical and simplified analytical approach to conservatively
   estimate a utility distribution feeder's accommodation limits without
   causing protection problems. Sympathetic tripping and relay
   insensitivity problems are considered in this paper under both
   symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault conditions. Using the analysis
   presented, the factors influencing these protection problems are
   determined to provide insights into relay settings. The feeder
   accommodation limits obtained using the proposed analytical approach are
   compared with those obtained using simulations of an actual detailed
   distribution circuit model. The findings show that the proposed approach
   is accurate in estimating the feeder's accommodation limits for

Title = {{Emissions from oil and gas operations in the United States and their air
   quality implications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{549-575}},
Abstract = {{The energy supply infrastructure in the United States has been changing
   dramatically over the past decade. Increased production of oil and
   natural gas, particularly from shale resources using horizontal drilling
   and hydraulic fracturing, made the United States the world's largest
   producer of oil and natural gas in 2014. This review examines air
   quality impacts, specifically, changes in greenhouse gas, criteria air
   pollutant, and air toxics emissions from oil and gas production
   activities that are a result of these changes in energy supplies and
   use. National emission inventories indicate that volatile organic
   compound (VOC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx(4)) emissions from oil and gas
   supply chains in the United States have been increasing significantly,
   whereas emission inventories for greenhouse gases have seen slight
   declines over the past decade. These emission inventories are based on
   counts of equipment and operational activities (activity factors),
   multiplied by average emission factors, and therefore are subject to
   uncertainties in these factors. Although uncertainties associated with
   activity data and missing emission source types can be significant,
   multiple recent measurement studies indicate that the greatest
   uncertainties are associated with emission factors. In many source
   categories, small groups of devices or sites, referred to as
   super-emitters, contribute a large fraction of emissions. When
   super-emitters are accounted for, multiple measurement approaches, at
   multiple scales, produce similar results for estimated emissions.
   Challenges moving forward include identifying super-emitters and
   reducing their emission magnitudes. Work done to date suggests that both
   equipment malfunction and operational practices can be important.
   Finally, although most of this review focuses on emissions from energy
   supply infrastructures, the regional air quality implications of some
   coupled energy production and use scenarios are examined. These case
   studies suggest that both energy production and use should be considered
   in assessing air quality implications of changes in energy
   infrastructures, and that impacts are likely to vary among regions.
   Implications: The energy supply infrastructure in the United States has
   been changing dramatically over the past decade, leading to changes in
   emissions from oil and natural gas supply chain sources. In many source
   categories along these supply chains, small groups of devices or sites,
   referred to as super-emitters, contribute a large fraction of emissions.
   Effective emission reductions will require technologies for both
   identifying super-emitters and reducing their emission magnitudes.}},

   for hydrophobic drug delivery}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{78}},
Pages = {{74072-74084}},
Abstract = {{Loading of hydrophobic drugs on smart carbon nano-carriers is a
   challenging issue for developing advanced drug delivery systems. We
   introduced a novel, stable, functionalized, and targeted graphene-based
   drug delivery system for smart transportation of hydrophobic agents. For
   this purpose, the planar size of graphene oxide (GO) sheets was
   initially engineered using ultra-sonic waves under controlled
   conditions. The sonication treatment not only tuned the GO sheet sizes,
   but also led to formation of desired reactive groups, appropriate for
   developing functionalized and targeted drug carriers. Afterwards, the
   hydrothermal reaction was simultaneously employed for both grafting R9
   peptides and reduction of GO sheets. Therefore, the produced functional
   structure is an R9-rGO complex with proper stability in physiological
   solutions and also with a high-performance loading capability of
   Paclitaxel (PX). The in vitro experiments revealed that the R9-rGO-PX
   compound was efficiently uptook by Hela cancer cell lines, and reduced
   the viability of Hela and MCF-7 cells more than 90\% after 72 hours. The
   proposed approach has the advantage of green production of an applicable
   graphene-based drug delivery system for improving the smart
   transportation of hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an imaging technique to locate damage in plate-like
   structures by permanently attached piezoelectric transducers (PZT)
   capable to generate and receive guided ultrasonic waves. The technique
   is based on a model capable of predicting envelope of scattered waves.
   Correlations between the estimated scattered waves and experimental data
   are used for image reconstruction. The approach is validated on an
   aluminum plate and results are compared with two common imaging
   algorithms, that is, Delay and Sum (DS) and Minimum Variance (MV).
   Damage is simulated by placing two magnets on sides of the plate. It is
   shown that the inclusion of Lamb wave reflections improves the
   localization accuracy while making use of fewer number of sensors
   possible.}},

Abstract = {{Freight constitutes a large portion of urban daily traffic, contributing
   to emissions, noise, and safety concerns. Moreover, urban freight
   logistics are often hindered by the last mile, characterized by
   significant delays and high delivery costs. Firms in dense urban areas
   are therefore seeking more efficient and reliable modes for their
   last-mile services. One mode that has been gaining widespread interest
   is the cargo cycle. Current research on cargo cycles is limited;
   however, their success in effectively delivering urban goods is gaining
   recognition. An examination was done of the economic feasibility of
   using different types of cargo cycles in varying urban contexts. A case
   study that assessed replacing the U.S. Postal Service vehicles with
   cargo cycles for last-mile mail deliveries in three population densities
   is presented. With the use of existing depots, the results of the case
   study indicate that electric cargo trikes have the lowest net present
   value among the modes in congested areas with high population densities
   such as central business districts. Moreover, having a depot positioned
   within the delivery area was found to play a significant role in
   increasing the competitiveness of trikes compared with other modes.}},

Abstract = {{Every year, more than 100,000 automobile crashes are caused by driver
   drowsiness. Various technologies have been developed to address this
   issue, including vehicle-based measurements, behavior change detection,
   and physiological signal analysis. Both vehicle-based measurements and
   behavior change detection require bulky components. They also identify
   the driver's drowsiness too late for effective accident prevention. The
   physiological signal changes in an early stage and can be used to detect
   the on-set of driver drowsiness. In this paper, the development of a
   wearable drowsiness detection system is introduced. This system measures
   the electrooculography (EOG) signal; transmits the signal to a
   smartphone wirelessly; and could alarm the driver based on a prediction
   algorithm that can estimate 0.5-second-ahead EOG signal behavior. This
   system is compact, comfortable, and cost effective. The 0.5-second-ahead
   estimation capability provides the critical time for a driver to correct
   the behavior, and ultimately saves lives.}},

Abstract = {{We address the inverse problem of inferring the basal geothermal heat
   flux from surface velocity observations using a steady-state
   thermomechanically coupled nonlinear Stokes ice flow model. This is a
   challenging inverse problem since the map from basal heat flux to
   surface velocity observables is indirect: the heat flux is a boundary
   condition for the thermal advection-diffusion equation, which couples to
   the nonlinear Stokes ice flow equations; together they determine the
   surface ice flow velocity. This multiphysics inverse problem is
   formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem with a cost
   functional that includes the data misfit between surface velocity
   observations and model predictions. A Tikhonov regularization term is
   added to render the problem well posed. We derive adjoint-based gradient
   and Hessian expressions for the resulting partial differential equation
   (PDE)-constrained optimization problem and propose an inexact Newton
   method for its solution. As a consequence of the Petrov-Galerkin
   discretization of the energy equation, we show that discretization and
   differentiation do not commute; that is, the order in which we
   discretize the cost functional and differentiate it affects the
   correctness of the gradient. Using two-and three-dimensional model
   problems, we study the prospects for and limitations of the inference of
   the geothermal heat flux field from surface velocity observations. The
   results show that the reconstruction improves as the noise level in the
   observations decreases and that short-wavelength variations in the
   geothermal heat flux are difficult to recover. We analyze the
   ill-posedness of the inverse problem as a function of the number of
   observations by examining the spectrum of the Hessian of the cost
   functional. Motivated by the popularity of operator-split or staggered
   solvers for forward multiphysics problems - i.e., those that drop
   two-way coupling terms to yield a one-way coupled forward Jacobian - we
   study the effect on the inversion of a one-way coupling of the adjoint
   energy and Stokes equations. We show that taking such a one-way coupled
   approach for the adjoint equations can lead to an incorrect gradient and
   premature termination of optimization iterations. This is due to loss of
   a descent direction stemming from inconsistency of the gradient with the
   contours of the cost functional. Nevertheless, one may still obtain a
   reasonable approximate inverse solution particularly if important
   features of the reconstructed solution emerge early in optimization
   iterations, before the premature termination.}},

Abstract = {{Acquiring local context information and sharing it among co-located
   devices is critical for emerging pervasive computing applications. The
   devices belonging to a group of co-located people may need to detect a
   shared activity (e.g., a meeting) to adapt their devices to support the
   activity. Today's devices are almost universally equipped with
   device-to-device communication that easily enables direct context
   sharing. While existing context sharing models tend not to consider
   devices' resource limitations or users' constraints, enabling devices to
   directly share context has significant benefits for efficiency, cost,
   and privacy. However, as we demonstrate quantitatively, when devices
   share context via device-to-device communication, it needs to be
   represented in a size-efficient way that does not sacrifice its
   expressiveness or accuracy. We present CHITCHAT, a suite of context
   representations that allows application developers to tune tradeoffs
   between the size of the representation, the flexibility of the
   application to update context information, the energy required to create
   and share context, and the quality of the information shared. We can
   substantially reduce the size of context representation (thereby
   reducing applications' overheads when they share their contexts with one
   another) with only a minimal reduction in the quality of shared
   contexts.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the consumption experiences of women who opt for an
   environmentally conscious approach to pregnancy. Our findings reveal
   that environmentally conscious mothers conduct extensive scientific
   research about the products that they purchase during pregnancy and the
   associated risks of using such products. They believe that their efforts
   to find and process such information make them experts on what is best
   for their babies' health and proclaim some micromanaging powers in an
   uncontrollable environment. Alas, consumption decisions are
   simultaneously coupled with tensions between (1) needing to make
   informed choices and being overwhelmed with information; (2) feeling
   confident about seeking consumption information and lacking the
   confidence to share it; and (3) pursuing external expertise and
   resorting to internal instincts. Thus, although consumption is often
   perceived as a helpful coping mechanism when transitioning to new life
   roles, we find that it also contributes to the complexity of such
   transitional situations.}},

   erroneous candidates for the spinal region. This segmentation step can
   be critical for further analysis of the spinal region either by a

   analysis of flicker videos in frequency domain, we propose a full

   flicker sensitive temporal visual masking. The framework predicts
   perceptually silenced flicker visibility using a model of the responses
   of primary visual cortex to video flicker, a motion energy model, and
   divisive normalization. By incorporating perceptual flicker visibility
   into motion tuned video quality measurements as in the MOVIE framework,
   we augment VQA performance with sensitivity to flicker. Results show
   that the proposed VQA framework correlates well with human results and

   this gap, Su et al. developed a closed form correlation model of

   extended this model to account for pixels separated by larger spatial
   distance. Here, we expand our previous work further to model the

Abstract = {{Micro/nanofluidic experiments in synthetic representations of tight
   porous media, often referred to as ``reservoir-on-a-chip{''} devices,
   are an emerging approach to researching anomalous fluid transport trends
   in energy-bearing and fluid-sequestering geologic porous media. We
   detail, for the first time, the construction of dual-scale
   micro/nanofluidic devices that are relatively large-scale,
   two-dimensional network representations of granular and fractured
   nanoporous media. The fabrication scheme used in the development of the
   networks on quartz substrates (master patterns) is facile and
   replicable: transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids with lacey
   carbon support film were used as shadow masks in thermal
   evaporation/deposition and reactive ion etch (RIE) was used for hardmask
   pattern transfer. The reported nanoscale network geometries are
   heterogeneous and composed of hydraulically resistive paths (throats)
   meeting at junctures (pores) to mimic the low topological connectivity
   of nanoporous sedimentary rocks such as shale. The geometry also
   includes homogenous microscale grid patterns that border the nanoscale
   networks and represent microfracture pathways. Master patterns were
   successfully replicated with a sequence of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   and Norland Optical Adhesive (NOA) 63 polymers. The functionality of the
   fabricated quartz and polymer nanofluidic devices was validated with
   aqueous imbibition experiments and differential interference contrast
   microscopy. These dual-scale fluidic devices are promising predictive
   tools for hypothesis testing and calibration against bulk fluid
   measurements in tight geologic, biologic, and synthetic porous material
   of similar dual-scale pore structure. Applications to shale/mudrock
   transport studies in particular are focused on herein.}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy (RS) is proving to be a valuable tool for real time
   noninvasive skin cancer detection via optical fiber probe. However,
   current methods utilizing RS for skin cancer diagnosis rely on
   statistically based algorithms to provide tissue classification and do
   not elucidate the underlying biophysical changes of skin tissue.
   Therefore, we aim to use RS to explore skin biochemical and structural
   characteristics and then correlate the Raman spectrum of skin tissue
   with its disease state. We have built a custom confocal micro-Raman
   spectrometer system with an 830nm laser light. The high resolution
   capability of the system allows us to measure spectroscopic features
   from individual tissue components in situ. Raman images were collected
   from human skin samples from Mohs surgical biopsy, which were then
   compared with confocal laser scanning, two-photon fluorescence and
   hematoxylin and eosin-stained images to develop a linear model of skin
   tissue Raman spectra. In this model, macroscopic tissue spectra obtained
   from RS fiber probe were fit into a linear combination of individual
   basis spectra of primary skin constituents. The fit coefficient of the
   model explains the biophysical changes spanning a range of normal and
   various disease states. The model allows for determining parameters
   similar to that a pathologist is familiar reading and will be a
   significant guidance in developing RS diagnostic decision schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A balanced electro-mechanical system must have the openness now
   represented by the electricals ( computer chips, power boards,
   standardized interfaces, domain-relevant operational software) and the
   reconfigurability to not only meet the needs of ever-changing tasks, but
   also enable rapid assembly, repair, and refreshment on demand by means
   of highly-certified components made available by means of a competitive
   supply chain. This, then, requires a command/response in milli-sec for
   multi-input/multi-output ( MIMO) systems that are normally perceived as
   highly non-linear and highly coupled ( i.e., unsolvable by standard
   analytic tools).
   Criteria-based decisions in milli-sec essentially linearize these
   systems to make strictly algebraic processes viable with little or no
   uncertainty so long as the operational criteria have clear physical
   meanings. The human command ( trains, surgery, aircraft, automobiles,
   etc.) in concert with semi-autonomous processes can be put into balance
   where each plays its relevant role. The missing ingredient in this
   accelerated development of the tech base for the mechanicals is the
   intelligent actuator ( i.e., the action part of the full physical
   system) as the computer chip is to the electrical system.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple research studies have examined the role of the undergraduate
   engineering curriculum on students' innovation capabilities. The
   majority of these studies have used cross-sectional samples to compare
   students at the beginning and end of their college careers, and most
   results have shown that seniors outperform freshmen. In the following
   paper, we use a combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal
   comparisons to uncover when innovation capabilities grow. Over a
   two-year period, undergraduate engineering majors at different points in
   their college careers completed concept generation tasks. Their
   resulting concepts were scored for originality. While no difference was
   found from freshman to senior year using a cross-sectional comparison, a
   significant increase in originality was found between separate senior
   groups at the beginning and end of a capstone course. The difference
   between the senior groups occurred despite no difference between these
   students in academic performance or engineering design self-efficacy. In
   addition, a significant increase in originality was found from junior to
   senior year using a longitudinal analysis. This increase in originality
   occurred without corresponding changes in academic performance or
   engineering design self-efficacy. These results are discussed in
   relation to prior research regarding the interplay between curricular
   and individual difference factors in the development of students'
   innovation capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Satisfying human needs means to respond directly to human choice / human
   commands at the time of purchase, in real time operation, for
   maintenance / tech mods over the life history of the vehicle, and for
   refreshment in the future hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) equipped with
   four-independent in wheel motors (IWM). This leads to maximizing human
   choice. To meet human choice means not only to keep the human fully
   informed on a series of choices, but also to maximize their
   self-awareness.
   Meeting human choice requires visual performance maps. Based on the
   future HEV with an open (modular) architecture, visual performance maps
   help customers make right choices what they want, so that a vehicle can
   be tailored to a particular customer priority such as cost and
   drivability for an aggressive driver. This paper demonstrates how
   different types of an IWM are matched to different types of customers.
   The decision framework developed in this paper is based on detailed
   human needs structured by performance maps to visually guide the
   customer in terms of purchase / operation / maintenance / refreshment
   decisions. Part I is focused on purchase criteria, while Part II
   discusses operation / maintenance / refreshment criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Part I of this paper demonstrated how different human choices affect the
   selection of all basic components of a Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV)
   equipped with four-independent In Wheel Motors (IWM) based on detailed
   human needs structured by visual performance maps to guide the customer
   in terms of purchase criteria: cost, weight, power, acceleration,
   gradeability, braking, handling, ride comfort, efficiency, and
   durability.
   This Part II discusses ten operation criteria: cornering force margin,
   roll angle, sideslip angle, lateral acceleration, slip angle, yaw rate,
   acceleration force margin, braking force margin, pitch angle, and travel
   range. These visual performance maps show the effects of HEV weight on
   acceleration, braking, and cornering maneuvers under various road
   conditions (i.e., dry asphalt, wet asphalt, snowy or icy road) which are
   evaluated and compared based on the implementation of a nonlinear 14 DOF
   full-vehicle model based on ride (7 DOF), handling (3 DOF), tire (4
   DOF), slip ratio, slip angle, and the tire magic formula. In addition,
   this paper demonstrates how different human choices affect the HEV's
   expected performance. Lastly, maintenance and refreshment criteria are
   presented and explained.}},

Abstract = {{The railroad industry expends significant effort to increase operational
   safety and efficiency by using a variety of sensors for machine health
   monitoring and inspection purposes. This paper proposes to advance rail
   technology even further to use similar sensor data for the control of a
   robotic system designed to automate the uncoupling of freight cars, a
   hazardous operation that currently requires human operators to interact
   with moving trains. To automate this process, an intelligent robotic
   system was developed to detect, track, approach, grasp, and manipulate
   semi-constrained objects on equipment in motion. This work presents a
   system prototype that utilizes machine vision, force feedback, and
   complex end-effector technology capable of autonomously uncoupling
   full-scale freight cars using visual and tactile feedback. Laboratory
   tests have proven that modern robotic and sensing hardware can be used
   to reliably separate pairs of rolling stock at 3.25 kilometers per hour.
   The results to date suggest that speeds of up to 7 km/h are feasible for
   a system deployed in a rail yard.}},

Abstract = {{Among heterogeneous catalysts, Pt/H-ZSM-5 zeolite has been widely
   utilized as an acid catalyst for reforming hydrocarbons, which converts
   heavy reformate into value-added BTX. In this work, we demonstrate the
   effect of the secondary pore structure in Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts on the
   catalytic performance for selective hydrodealkylation of C-9(+)
   aromatics. Mesoporous Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst with a bimodal pore system is
   simply synthesized by caustic treatment with sodium hydroxide solution.
   Multiple techniques, such as SEM, TEM, ICP, and N-2 adsorption
   techniques, are employed for the physical characterization of
   conventional Pt/H-ZSM-5 and mesoporous Pt/H-ZSM-5. The as-prepared
   Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are investigated for their catalytic performance as
   a function of alkali-treatment time, including ET (ethyl toluene)
   conversion and TMB (trimethyl benzene) recovery yield. The
   alkali-treated Pt/H-ZSM-5 for 120 min (Pt/H-ZSM-5(120)) demonstrated
   excellent catalytic activities on the selective hydrodealkylation of
   C-9(+) aromatics, even at a low reaction temperature. The exceptional
   catalytic behavior at low temperature can be attributed to the
   generation of secondary mesoporous systems within the zeolite catalysts,
   which can promote the mass transfer of reactant and generated products
   and effectively suppress coke deposition. The findings reported herein
   suggest that this strategy can be effectively used not only to reduce
   energy consumption but also to provide a cost-saving process for
   producing BTX.}},

Abstract = {{Smoke spread through the elevator shafts of high rise buildings has been
   numerically investigated using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), which
   is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program suitable for fire
   induced heat and mass transfer. A model of a high rise building was
   developed and a fire was set at the first level. The smoke spread
   process through the elevator shafts was evaluated. The process can be
   divided into two phases. In the first phase, the smoke gradually fills
   the shafts, and the gas temperature and pressure in the shafts are
   transient. After this phase, the smoke fully fills the shafts, the
   temperature and pressure in the shaft are almost steady, which suggests
   that the smoke inflow rate equals the outflow rate. Throughout the
   process, the spatial distributions of temperature and pressure in the
   elevator shaft under fire situations were reported. The hot fire product
   gases entering the shaft causes a stack effect, which transports smoke
   to the upper levels. A method of partially enclosing the elevator
   lobbies was also investigated by the CFD simulation. The results were
   compared with the unenclosed situation, and showed that enclosing
   lobbies not only increases the time needed for the smoke to fully fill
   the shafts, but also reduces the temperature and pressure differences in
   the shafts.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling of heat transfer processes for controls applications requires
   that the modeler make a set of assumptions that strikes a balance
   between accuracy and simulation run time. Common points of consideration
   include choosing the appropriate dimension of the model, the importance
   of transient effects, numerical and temporal discretization, etc. The
   results of these decisions directly impact the speed and accuracy of the
   model. It can be useful for the modeler to build a framework containing
   a set of models for a given system where each model contains a different
   set assumptions. This allows for easy comparison of different classes of
   models and aids in the decision process for selecting the model that
   best fits the needs of the user
   This work takes the modeling of an open flame hearth furnace as a case
   study and examines the implications of different modeling
   simplifications. This scenario is similar to plug flow reactors (PFRs)
   and continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) in that reactions are
   occurring in a chamber where mass is flowing in to and out of the
   system. Modeling of these systems focuses on the concentration of the
   reactants, whereas the hearth furnace model seeks to capture the heat
   transfer to the work-piece and walls. Numerous models of PRFs and CSTRs
   exist in literature as well as several open-fire furnace models using
   Hottel's zone method. This work builds off of these modeling techniques
   by testing several types of models for speed and accuracy.
   Both steady-state and transient operation are considered and each of the
   different heat transfer phenomena are modeled in varying dimensions. The
   open-flame environment inside the furnace produces gases that
   participate in radiative heat transfer for which there are a number of
   different models. The P1 approximation to the method of spherical
   harmonics is used, both in three dimensions and a simplification to one
   dimensional radiation. The flow of gases inside the furnace is
   considered to be plug flow with a series of burners injecting hot gases
   along the length of the furnace. Conduction to the walls and work-piece
   occurs at much longer time scales than convection, i.e. the combustion
   gases are moving through the furnace much faster than the characteristic
   thermal response time of the walls and work pieces (tau(gas) <<
   tau(wall)). This brings the modeler to the question of how to model
   transient effects at such disparate time scales. A model is posited that
   is a combination of quasi-steady radiative heat transfer, transient
   fluid evolution, and lumped transient conduction. This formulation takes
   advantage of the disparity in time scales to take large steps in time
   when solving the radiation equation while solving the energy equation at
   each time step for the internal gas control volumes. This model is then
   compared on the grounds of speed and accuracy to the more traditional
   explicit advancement of a consistent time step in both the gas energy
   balance and radiative transfer solution.}},

Abstract = {{Cereus peruvianus (Peruvian apple cactus) is a large erect and thorny
   succulent cactus characterized by column-like (cereus {[} L]: column),
   that is, candle-shaped, appendages. For three successive years (1100
   days), between early April and late November, we studied the flowering
   patterns of eight cacti growing in public gardens and rural areas of
   north and central Tunisia, far from nighttime artificial illumination,
   in relation to natural environmental light, temperature, relative
   humidity and precipitation parameters. Flower blooming was assessed
   nightly between 23:00 h and until at least 02: 00 h, and additionally
   around-the-clock at similar to 1 h intervals for 30 consecutive days
   during the late summer of each year of study to quantify both
   nyctohemeral (day-night) and lunar patterns. During the summer months of
   prolonged daytime photoperiod, flower blooming of C. peruvianus
   exhibited predictable-in-time variation as ``waves{''} with average
   period of 29.5 days synchronized by the light of the full moon. The
   large-sized flower (similar to 16 cm diameter) opens almost exclusively
   at night, between sunset and sunrise, as a 24 h rhythm during a specific
   3-4-day span of the lunar cycle (full moon), with a strong correlation
   between moon phase and number and proportion of flowers in bloom
   (ranging from r = + 0.59 to + 0.91). Black, blue and red cotton sheets
   were used to filter specific spectral bands of nighttime moonlight from
   illuminating randomly selected plant appendages as a means to test the
   hypothesis of a ``gating{''} 24 h rhythm phenomenon of photoreceptors at
   the bud level. Relative to control conditions (no light filtering),
   black sheet covering inhibited flower bud induction by 87.5\%, red sheet
   covering by 46.6\% and blue sheet covering by 34\%, and the respective
   inhibiting effects on number of flowers in bloom were essentially 100\%,
   similar to 81\% and similar to 44\%. C. peruvianus is a unique example
   of a terrestrial plant that exhibits a circadian flowering rhythm (peak
   similar to 00:00 h) ``gated{''} by 24 h, lunar 29.5-day (bright light of
   full moon) and annual 365.25-day (prolonged summertime day length)

Abstract = {{Biological rhythmicity is presumed to be an advantageous genetic
   adaptation of fitness and survival value resulting from evolution of
   life forms in an environment that varies predictably-in-time during the
   24 h, month, and year. The 24 h light/dark cycle is the prime
   synchronizer of circadian periodicities, and its modulation over the
   course of the year, in terms of daytime photoperiod length, is a prime
   synchronizer of circannual periodicities. Circadian and circannual
   rhythms have been the major research focus of most scientists.
   Circa-monthly rhythms triggered or synchronized by the 29.5 day lunar
   cycle of nighttime light intensity, or specifically the light of the
   full moon, although explored in waterborne and certain other species,
   have received far less study, perhaps because of associations with
   ancient mythology and/or an attitude naturalistic studies are of lesser
   merit than ones that entail molecular mechanisms. In this editorial, we
   cite our recent discovery through multidisciplinary naturalistic
   investigation of a highly integrated circadian, circa-monthly, and
   circannual time structure, synchronized by the natural ambient
   nyctohemeral, lunar, and annual light cycles, of the Peruvian apple
   cactus (C. peruvianus) flowering and reproductive processes that occur
   in close temporal coordination with like rhythms of the honey bee as its
   pollinator. This finding led us to explore the preservation of this
   integrated biological time structure, synchronized and/or triggered by
   environmental light cues and cycles, in the reproduction of other
   species, including Homo sapiens, and how the artificial light
   environment of today in which humans reside may be negatively affecting
   human reproduction efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of studies on ice formation have attempted to prevent or
   reduce ice build-up; very few studies have focused on promoting ice
   nucleation which would have applications in appliances,
   cryopreservation, and pharmaceutical freeze-drying. Such studies are
   also relevant to the synthesis of methane hydrates for natural gas
   transportation. This paper details a fundamental study on the influence
   of interfacial electric fields on ice nucleation promotion.
   Electrofreezing, i.e. applying an electric field has been shown to
   electrically induce nucleation of supercooled water. The freezing
   temperatures of supercooled water can thus be increased via
   electrofreezing. However, the mechanisms responsible for elevating the
   freezing temperature are unclear. Typically, bare electrodes are
   submerged in water, which creates a volumetric electric field in water.
   With this type of electric field, the application of a voltage can
   result in multiple phenomena such as current flows, chemical reactions
   and gas bubble formation or growth. It is unclear whether
   electrofreezing is the result of the electric field or the current
   flow-related secondary phenomena.
   In the present work, the role of electric fields and surface charge on
   electrofreezing is isolated by studying electrofreezing of water
   droplets on a dielectric layer. This dielectric layer blocks current and
   creates an interfacial electric field with a build-up of electric charge
   at the solid-fluid interface. Ultrahigh electric fields of up to 80 V/mu
   m were applied, which is one order of magnitude higher than in previous
   studies. Infrared (IR) thermography was used to capture ice nucleation
   and determine the electrofreezing temperature. The results show that the
   electric fields alone can elevate the freezing temperature of water by
   as much as 15 degrees C; however, this effect saturates at electric
   fields of approximately 20-40 V/mu m. Also, the electrofreezing effect
   was found to be polarity independent. Therefore, it is hypothesized that
   the mechanism underlying electrofreezing is a reduction in the Gibbs
   free energy for ice crystal nucleation. Furthermore, by intentionally
   creating pinholes in the dielectric layer, which creates current paths,
   the influence of electric current on electrofreezing was also studied.
   It was observed that electric currents and/or other secondary effects,
   such as bubble generation, further increased the electrofreezing
   temperatures.
   Overall, this work fills many existing gaps in the current understanding
   of electrofreezing. It is seen that both the electric field and electric
   current influence electrofreezing; however, the physical mechanisms are
   different.}},

Abstract = {{The trajectory of a water jet is important in many applications,
   including fire protection, irrigation, and decorative fountains.
   Increasing the maximum distance the jet travels by changing the nozzle
   or other variables is often desirable. This distance could be the
   horizontal range (also often called the reach or throw) or the maximum
   vertical height. Which factors control the trajectory are unclear.
   Consequently, a simple analytical model is developed which provides a
   qualitative understanding of the system. This model differs
   significantly from previous models. Previous models either used a
   dragless trajectory, which is correct according to potential flow theory
   if the jet does not break into droplets, or treated the trajectory as if
   droplets formed immediately upon leaving the nozzle. Both approaches
   have been noted to be unsatisfactory by past researchers. Our model
   compares favorably against available experimental data. Using our model,
   we show that the range decreases as the nozzle Froude number increases
   and that range increases as breakup length and droplet size increase.}},

Title = {{Pavement Maintenance Prioritization Tool for Effects of Hydraulic
   Fracturing}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{65-70}},
Abstract = {{Every year, millions of taxpayers' dollars are spent maintaining roads.
   The money is used to repair damage that occurs to pavements, bridges,
   and other elements of the roadway system. The service life of a pavement
   can be greatly reduced by unexpected heavy loading, which is one
   consequence of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activity in rural areas.
   This paper describes a tool that can potentially lengthen the service
   life of pavements, especially thin pavement structures, by predicting
   unusually heavy loading. Predicting activities that cause increased
   truck loading can help agencies plan preventive measures to reinforce
   pavement structures before they fail. The goal of this study was to
   develop a tool, an early warning system (EWS), that can help to predict
   locations where damage from heavy truck traffic will occur. Truck travel
   related to the oil and gas industry is predictable and has recently had
   significant effects on pavement deterioration. The study focused on well
   permitting activity in the Austin, Texas, Department of Transportation
   district. ArcGIS software was used to find route assignments by using
   trip origins and destinations for fracking activity, truck volume, and
   vehicle weights. Several road segments that would be at risk for heavy
   loading and shortened service life were successfully identified. This
   tool can provide information needed to prioritize proactive pavement
   maintenance for more effective use of tax dollars. This tool could
   potentially also be used to determine a roughly proportional cost of
   damage from fracking activity to be levied on the oil and gas industry,
   thus alleviating the burden on taxpayers.}},

Abstract = {{Ion exchange membranes are used in various membrane-based processes
   (e.g., electrodialysis, fuel cells). Charged solute transport is largely
   governed by the charged groups on the polymer backbone. In this review,
   fundamental relationships describing salt permeability and ionic
   conductivity, as well as water permeability, in charged polymers are
   developed within the framework of the Nernst-Planck and
   solution-diffusion models. The influence of fixed charge groups and
   polymer structure on water sorption and diffusion is discussed. Current
   understanding of ion partitioning in charged polymers, focusing on the
   use of thermodynamic models (i.e., Donnan theory) to describe such
   phenomena, is summarized. Ion diffusivity data from the literature are
   interpreted using a model developed by Mackie and Meares to assess
   relative and absolute effects of the polymer and fixed charge groups on
   ion diffusivity. Furthermore, membrane requirements for several
   important technologies are listed. Knowledge gaps and opportunities for
   fundamental research are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews the basic principles of and recent developments in
   electrochromic, photochromic, and thermochromic materials for
   applications in smart windows. Compared with current static windows,
   smart windows can dynamically modulate the transmittance of solar
   irradiation based on weather conditions and personal preferences, thus
   simultaneously improving building energy efficiency and indoor human
   comfort. Although some smart windows are commercially available, their
   widespread implementation has not yet been realized. Recent advances in
   nanostructured materials provide new opportunities for next-generation
   smart window technology owing to their unique structure-property
   relations. Nanomaterials can provide enhanced coloration efficiency,
   faster switching kinetics, and longer lifetime. In addition, their
   compatibility with solution processing enables low-cost and
   high-throughput fabrication. This review also discusses the importance
   of dual-band modulation of visible and near-infrared (NIR) light, as
   nearly 50\% of solar energy lies in the NIR region. Some latest results
   show that solution-processable nanostructured systems can selectively
   modulate the NIR light without affecting the visible transmittance, thus
   reducing energy consumption by air conditioning, heating, and artificial
   lighting.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Deep tissue ablation is the next challenge in ultrafast
   laser microsurgery. By focusing ultrafast pulses below the tissue
   surface one can create an ablation void confined to the focal volume.
   However, pulse energies need to increase exponentially as the ablation
   depth increases due to tissue scattering. Optical clearing (OC) might
   reduce the intensity and increase the maximal ablation depth by lowering
   the refractive index mismatch, and therefore reducing scattering. In our
   previously proposed clinical goal we aim at creating superficial voids
   below the epithelium in scarred vocal folds to enable localization of
   injected biomaterials to bring back the tissue elasticity and restore
   phonation. In another application, our goal is to remove small lesions
   in delicate vocal folds by detaching them from tissue by ablating around
   them which ideally should start as deep as possible.
   Materials and methods: Fresh porcine vocal folds were excised and
   subject to treatment with OC agent (75\% glycerol). Collimated
   transmittance was monitored. The tissue was optically cleared and put
   under the microscope for ablation threshold measurements at different
   depths.
   Results: The tissue optically cleared after approximately two hours of
   treatment. Fitting the ablation threshold measurements to an exponential
   decay graph indicated that the scattering length of the tissue increased
   to 83 +/- 16 mu m, more than doubling the known scattering length for
   normal tissue.
   Conclusion: Optical clearing with glycerol increases the tissue
   scattering length and therefore reduces the energy for ablation and
   increases the maximal ablation depth. This technique can potentially
   improve clinical microsurgery.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Department of Defense has recently shown an interest in
   incorporating the concepts of energy efficiency and energy security into
   decision-making processes, including decisions that pertain to military
   base camp equipment. Logistics-transportation of resources to forward
   locations in a military context-make up the vast majority of costs
   associated with base camp resource use, but costs vary widely according
   to operational factors. Changing costs of resources affects cost-benefit
   analyses of resource-saving devices, confounding decision-making
   processes. A method for volumetric accounting is proposed, described,
   and demonstrated in this article through an example design problem,
   yielding metrics that engineering managers can use to effectively
   compare the benefits of resource-saving equipment without requiring
   quantification of money-saving potential. The metrics and method
   proposed in this analysis complement existing measures and have the
   potential to streamline certain decision-making processes, leading to
   more efficient, effective, and economical military base camps while also
   taking resource resupply convoys off dangerous roads.}},

   without thermal damage. However, deep tissue ablation has been limited
   to a few scattering lengths due to laser beam extinction. As pulse
   energies are increased to overcome attenuation, unwanted side effects
   can occur such as self-focusing, where the highly intense pulse alters
   the refractive index of the material, causing a lensing effect and long
   filaments of damage or complete beam collapse before the focus. Here, we
   examine laser parameters to overcome self-focusing for deep tissue
   ablation. Through imaging ablation voids with third harmonic generation,
   we show that increasing the pulse width from 200-fs to 2-ps reduces
   self-focusing induced focal plane shifting and avoids multiple
   filamentation altogether, resulting in deeper ablation without extended
   axial damage. Additionally, we simulate beam propagation for pulses of
   different central wavelengths, and show that longer wavelengths can
   ablate deeper because of decreased scattering in tissue and a subsequent
   reduction in self-focusing.}},

Abstract = {{A new class of magnet-free nonreciprocal plasmonic devices operating at
   terahertz (THz) frequencies is introduced based on the spatiotemporal
   modulation of graphene's conductivity. The proposed components are based
   on graphene parallel-plate waveguides with double-gated electrodes,
   which allow independent manipulation of graphene properties in both
   space and time. We employ this structure for the design of plasmonic
   isolators and leaky-wave antennas at THz frequencies and study the
   effect of graphene and modulation parameters on their response. We
   envision that this technology may pave the way towards
   silicon-compatible fully planar nonreciprocal plasmonic components and
   antennas with enhanced functionalities at THz, with important
   applications in biosensing, imaging, and intra/interchip communications.}},

Abstract = {{As psychophysical studies are resource-intensive to conduct, model
   observers are commonly used to assess and optimize medical imaging
   quality. Existing model observers were typically designed to detect at
   most one signal. However, in clinical practice, there may be multiple
   abnormalities in a single image set (e.g., multifocal and multicentric
   breast cancers (MMBC)), which can impact treatment planning. Prevalence
   of signals can be different across anatomical regions, and human
   observers do not know the number or location of signals a priori. As new
   imaging techniques have the potential to improve multiple-signal
   detection (e.g., digital breast tomosynthesis may be more effective for
   diagnosis of MMBC than planar mammography), image quality assessment
   approaches addressing such tasks are needed. In this study, we present a
   model-observer mechanism to detect multiple signals in the same image
   dataset. To handle the high dimensionality of images, a novel
   implementation of partial least squares (PLS) was developed to estimate
   different sets of efficient channels directly from the images. Without
   any prior knowledge of the background or the signals, the PLS channels
   capture interactions between signals and the background which provide
   discriminant image information. Corresponding linear decision templates
   are employed to generate both image-level and location-specific scores
   on the presence of signals. Our preliminary results show that the model
   observer using PLS channels, compared to our first attempts with
   Laguerre-Gauss channels, can achieve high performance with a reasonably
   small number of channels, and the optimal design of the model observer
   may vary as the tasks of clinical interest change.}},

Abstract = {{The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from dynamic contrast enhanced
   (DCE) MRI have shown promise as biomarkers for tumor response to
   therapy. However, standard methods of analyzing DCE MRI data (Tofts
   model) require high temporal resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR), and the Arterial Input Function (AIF). Such models produce
   reliable biomarkers of response only when a therapy has a large effect
   on the parameters. We recently reported a method that solves the
   limitations, the Linear Reference Region Model (LRRM) Similar to other
   reference region models, the LRRM needs no AIF. Additionally, the LRRM
   is more accurate and precise than standard methods at low SNR and slow
   temporal resolution, suggesting LRRM-derived biomarkers could be better
   predictors. Here, the LRRM, Non-linear Reference Region Model (NRRM),
   Linear Tofts model (LTM), and Non-linear Tofts Model (NLTM) were used to
   estimate the R-Ktrans between muscle and tumor (or the K-trans for
   Tofts) and the tumor k(ep,TOI) for 39 breast cancer patients who
   received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). These parameters and the
   receptor statuses of each patient were used to construct cross-validated
   predictive models to classify patients as complete pathological
   responders (pCR) or non-complete pathological responders (non-pCR) to
   NAC. Model performance was evaluated using area under the ROC curve
   (AUC). The AUC for receptor status alone was 0.62, while the best
   performance using predictors from the LRRM, NRRM, LTM, and NLTM were
   AUCs of 0.79, 0.55, 0.60, and 0.59 respectively. This suggests that the
   LRRM can be used to predict response to NAC in breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical anisotropic properties of the cornea can be an important
   indicator for determining the onset and severity of different diseases
   and can be used to assess the efficacy of various therapeutic
   interventions, such as cross-linking and LASIK surgery. In this work, we
   introduce a noncontact method of assessing corneal mechanical anisotropy
   as a function of intraocular pressure (IOP) using optical coherence
   elastography (OCE). A focused air-pulse induced low amplitude (<10 mu m)
   elastic waves in fresh porcine corneas in the whole eye-globe
   configuration in situ. A phase-stabilized swept source optical coherence
   elastography (PhS-SSOCE) system imaged the elastic wave propagation at
   stepped radial angles, and the OCE measurements were repeated as the IOP
   was cycled. The elastic wave velocity was then quantified to determine
   the mechanical anisotropy and hysteresis of the cornea. The results show
   that the elastic anisotropy at the corneal of the apex of the cornea
   becomes more pronounced at higher IOPs, and that there are distinct
   radial angles of higher and lower stiffness. Due to the noncontact
   nature and small amplitude of the elastic wave, this method may be
   useful for characterizing the elastic anisotropy of ocular and other
   tissues in vivo completely noninvasively.}},

   The system was tested on incisions in the corneas of 15 eyes of pigs,

Title = {{Inversion-based interpretation of logging-while-drilling gamma-ray

Abstract = {{Neutron-induced spectroscopy measurements are commonly used to quantify
   in situ elemental compositions of rocks from the processing of measured
   gamma-ray energy spectra. However, geometric effects on the measured
   spectroscopy logs, such as thin beds, dipping beds, and deviated well
   trajectories, can cause shoulder-bed averaging that compromises the
   assessment of the true layer elemental composition. We have developed an
   inversion-based interpretation method to evaluate layer elemental
   compositions from spectroscopy measurements acquired with a commercial
   14-MeV pulsed-neutron logging-while-drilling spectroscopy tool. The
   algorithm is based on a new spectroscopy fast-forward simulation
   technique, and it estimates layer-by-layer elemental relative yields,
   weight concentrations, and their uncertainties. Calculations are
   performed with inelastic and capture gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements
   that arose from high-and low-energy neutron interactions, respectively.
   This strategy provides two sets of data that independently validate
   estimated elemental compositions and can ascertain chemical elements
   present in only one measurement mode. In laminated formations in which
   layer thicknesses are appreciably below the vertical resolution of the
   tool, it is impossible to quantify layer properties with inversion
   methods. We have therefore developed an additional interpretation method
   based on a spectroscopy mixing law to estimate elemental compositions
   within individual laminae. The new inversion-based interpretation
   methods were successfully verified with two challenging synthetic cases
   and implemented in two field cases with varying lithology and well
   trajectories. Our results found that the developed methods reduced
   shoulder-bed averaging effects on the measured spectroscopy logs by as
   much as a 0.4 yield fraction and a 0.17 weight fraction. Estimated
   elemental compositions with reduced shoulder-bed averaging effects
   improved the calculations in subsequent spectroscopy-based petrophysical
   interpretation.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Natural scene statistics (NSSs) provide powerful, perceptually relevant
   tools that have been successfully used for image quality analysis of
   visible light images. Since NSS capture statistical regularities that
   arise from the physical world, they are relevant to long wave infrared
   (LWIR) images, which differ from visible light images mainly by the
   wavelengths captured at the imaging sensors. We show that NSS models of
   bandpass LWIR images are similar to those of visible light images, but
   with different parameterizations. Using this difference, we exploit the
   power of NSS to successfully distinguish between LWIR images and visible
   light images. In addition, we study distortions unique to LWIR and find
   directional models useful for detecting the halo effect, simple bandpass
   models useful for detecting hotspots, and combinations of these models
   useful for measuring the degree of non-uniformity present in many LWIR
   images. For local distortion identification and measurement, we also
   describe a method for generating distortion maps using NSS features. To
   facilitate our evaluation, we analyze the NSS of LWIR images under
   pristine and distorted conditions, using four databases, each captured
   with a different IR camera. Predicting human performance for assessing
   distortion and quality in LWIR images is critical for task efficacy. We
   find that NSS features improve human targeting task performance
   prediction. Furthermore, we conducted a human study on the perceptual
   quality of noise- and blur-distorted LWIR images and create a new blind
   image quality predictor for IR images.}},

Abstract = {{The life-cycle cost of a rail transit system is critical to decision
   makers when choosing the appropriate mode, e.g., at-grade versus
   underground, to build a rail transit system over the past decades in
   China. This is particularly true when private sectors are involved
   through alternative delivery methods such as public-private partnerships
   (PPPs). This article proposes a generalized life-cycle model that
   considers various attributes of rail transit systems common to big
   cities in China. Line 1 of Shijiazhuang rail transit was employed as a
   case study to validate the model, where the life-cycle costs of at-grade
   and underground mode were analysed using both traditional methods mode
   and the proposed methodology. The analysis results show that, in terms
   of the generalized life-cycle cost, the underground mode is preferred
   over the at-grade mode, which is consistent with the current practices
   of rail transit construction in China.}},

Abstract = {{Subwavelength grating (SWG) waveguide is an intriguing alternative to
   conventional optical waveguides due to its freedom to tune a few
   important waveguide properties such as dispersion and refractive index.
   Devices based on SWG waveguide have demonstrated impressive performances
   compared to those of conventional waveguides. However, the large loss of
   SWG waveguide bends jeopardizes their applications in integrated
   photonics circuits. In this work, we propose that a pre-distorted
   refractive index distribution in SWG waveguide bends can effectively
   decrease the mode mismatch noise and radiation loss simultaneously, and
   thus significantly reduce the bend loss. Here, we achieved the
   pre-distortion refractive index distribution by using trapezoidal
   silicon pillars. This geometry tuning approach is numerically optimized
   and experimentally demonstrated. The average insertion loss of a 5 mu m
   SWG waveguide bend can be reduced drastically from 5.58 dB to 1.37 dB
   per 90 degrees bend for quasi-TE polarization. In the future, the
   proposed approach can be readily adopted to enhance performance of an
   array of SWG waveguide-based photonics devices.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, silicon photonics has attracted intensive research
   interest in optical communications due to its advantageous compact
   dimensions and high-volume manufacturability. Particularly, micro-ring
   resonators on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform have been widely
   exploited as a basic building block for a vast range of applications
   such as switches, modulators, and sensors. A majority of these
   applications involve light-matter interaction, which can be
   substantially enhanced by the high quality factor micro-ring resonators.
   However, conventional strip waveguide based micro-ring resonators suffer
   from the intrinsic dilemma in achieving high light confinement and
   strong light-matter interaction simultaneously. Subwavelength grating
   (SWG) waveguides, comprised of periodically interleaved high and low
   refractive index materials with a pitch less than one wavelength, have
   been demonstrated as a promising alternative. For SWG waveguides built
   on SOI wafers, the ratio of silicon and cladding materials can be
   engineered microscopically to achieve desired macroscopic properties.
   The control of these properties could potentially lead to significant
   performance improvements compared with conventional micro-ring
   resonators based photonic devices, such as filters and sensors. However,
   SWG waveguide based micro-ring resonators (SWGMRs) that have been
   demonstrated so far can only provide a moderate quality factor (similar
   to 5600) with a large radius (e.g. 15 mu m), which greatly jeopardize
   the wide spread research efforts in this area. In this paper, we propose
   to use trapezoidal silicon pillars to reduce the bend loss of SWGMRs to
   improve the quality factor. For the first time, we experimentally
   demonstrate the smallest SWGMR (the micro-ring radius equals to 5 mu m)
   with an applicable quality factor as high as 11,500. This approach also
   can be applied to SWGMRs with larger radii for higher quality factors.
   We also experimentally demonstrated a 10 mu m radius SWGMR that can
   provide a quality factor up to 45,000. Compared to SWGMRs built with
   conventional rectangular silicon pillars, the quality factors is
   increased by 4.6 times from a 5 mu m radius SWGMR and 3 times from a 10
   mu m SWGMR radius, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time estimation of annular pressure profile and formation pressure
   is crucial for the execution and planning of a well control operation,
   especially when drilling formations with narrow pore and fracture
   pressure margins. A simple transient multi phase simulator, capable of
   accurately representing gas and liquid dynamics while minimizing
   complexity and computational requirements, is highly desirable for
   real-time kick mitigation and control applications. Such a simulator is
   presented here in the form of a coupled ODE-PDE model composed of a
   first order ODE and a first order hyperbolic PDE. This model is shown to
   retain the dominating two-phase dynamics encountered during gas kick
   incidents. As a particular application, we demonstrate the use of the
   model in design of switched control algorithms for kick handling in a
   Managed Pressure Drilling setting. A Recursive Least Squares algorithm
   is employed for estimation of unknown model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The Anatomically Correct Testbed (ACT) Hand was designed to allow
   researchers to explore the properties of the human hand without the need
   for cadaver specimens. Previous experiments to validate the anatomical
   accuracy of the ACT Hand have been performed to comparing the moment
   arms, the mechanical advantage of the tendons on each joint, to cadaver
   studies. Here, an experiment involving the individual tendon loading of
   the ACT index finger was performed as additional anatomical validation
   of the ACT Hand. These experiments were used to compare the ACT index
   finger to an index finger cadaver study and validate a bond graph model
   of the index finger tendon system. The results showed agreement (less
   than two standard deviations) between the fingertip forces of the ACT
   index finger and cadaver studies. The results also showed agreement
   (less than one standard deviation) between the fingertip forces of the
   ACT index finger and the presented bond graph tendon model.}},

Abstract = {{During drilling operations, rock-bit interactions may cause a wide range
   of undesirable system vibrations. The induced vibrations subsequently
   reduce drilling efficiency and increase fatigue loads acting on drill
   bit. In this paper, a coupled torsional and axial drilling model is
   proposed. It can be used to predict the vibrations including bit bounce
   and stick-slip. Instead of using finite element (FEM) approach, the
   drill pipe is accurately modeled based on wave propagation theory. This
   results in time-delay equations in time domain and significantly reduces
   the computational complexity associated with FEM. The axial and
   torsional motions are coupled by bit-rock interactions. Different
   rock-bit interaction conditions are considered based on bit rotation and
   contact with formation. Simulations are conducted using the proposed
   model to analyze the impact of different applied weights on bit and
   surface rotary speeds on the system vibrations. This information
   provides insights into optimization of drilling operation.}},

Abstract = {{Compliance is a key requirement for safe interactions with the
   environment for any robot. It has been well established that the human
   body exploits various arrangements of compliance such as series
   compliance (musculo-tendon units) and parallel compliance (joint
   capsules and ligament complex) to achieve robust and graceful
   interaction with the environment. Mechanical compliance can be similarly
   arranged in robotic joints in series or parallel to actuators. The
   effects of such arrangements on the closed loop properties of robotic
   joints such as stability, disturbance rejection and tracking performance
   have been analyzed separately, but their combined effects have not been
   studied. We present a detailed analysis on the combined effects of
   series and parallel arrangements of compliance on low inertia robotic
   joints. Our analysis shows the stability limitations of achievable joint
   stiffness due to series compliance and the subsequent increase in the
   stable upper limit of achievable joint stiffness by addition of parallel
   compliance. We provide guidelines towards designing compliance to
   improve the stability and performance of low-inertia robotic joints,
   which can be applied to the improvement of robotic hands performing
   grasping and manipulation tasks. We validate our analysis by means of an
   experimental platform and discuss the various characteristics and the
   effects of both arrangements of compliance on robotic hands.}},

Abstract = {{We present two types of subject-specific assist-as-needed controllers
   for the index finger module of a hand exoskeleton designed for
   rehabilitation after a neuromuscular impairment such as stroke. Learned
   force-field control is a novel control technique in which a
   neural-network-based model of the required torques is learned for a
   specific subject and then used to build a force-field to assist the
   subject's finger joint motion. Adaptive assist-as-needed control, on the
   other hand, estimates the coupled finger-exoskeleton system torque
   requirement of a subject using radial basis function (RBF) and
   on-the-fly adapts the RBF magnitudes to provide a feed-forward
   assistance for improved trajectory tracking. Experiments on the index
   finger exoskeleton prototype with a healthy subject showed that while
   the force fieldcontrol is non-adaptive and there is less control on the
   speed of execution of the task, it is safer as it does not apply
   increased torques if the finger motion is restricted. On the other hand,
   adaptive assist-as-needed controller adapts to the changing needs of the
   coupled finger-exoskeleton system and helps in performing the task with
   a consistent speed, however, applies increased torques in case of
   restricted motion resulting in potential user discomfort.}},

Abstract = {{At the hardware level, servo drives are traditionally ontrolled in the
   position or velocity domain Frequently,-oboticists do not recognize the
   significance of selecting one :ontrol domain over the other. This paper
   argues that velocity ontrol is the clear choice for reactive trajectory
   modification nd online motion planning. Velocity control provides
   smoother motion, is more suitable for low.control frequencies,
   more-obust to control signal variation, and it reduces collision forces
   more effectively. The primary advantage of position control is inherent
   safety with regards to signal delays. To support these loints, this
   paper presents mathematical, graphical and experimental evidence. New
   experimental results explore the-obustness of velocity control with
   regards to low-frequency :ontrol signals and signal delay. The
   experiment is based on a ooperative manipulation task performed with
   stiff industrial manipulators. Position and velocity control are also
   directly :compared using a one-DOF linear actuator force control task
   using total work performed as a performance metric.}},

Abstract = {{The biomechanical properties of the cornea have a profound influence on
   its health and function. Rose bengal/green light corneal collagen
   cross-linking (RGX) has been proposed as an alternative to UV-A
   Riboflavin collagen cross-linking (UV-CXL) for treatment of keratoconus.
   However, the effects of RGX on the biomechanical properties of the
   cornea are not as well understood as UV-CXL. In this work, we
   demonstrate the feasibility of quantifying the viscoelasticity of the
   rabbit cornea before and after RGX using a noncontact method of
   phase-stabilized swept source optical coherence elastography (PhS-SSOCE)
   and finite element modeling (FEM). Viscoelastic FE models of the corneas
   were constructed to simulate the elastic wave propagation based on the
   OCE measurements. In addition, the effect of the fluid-structure
   interface (FSI) between the corneal posterior surface and aqueous humor
   on the elastic wave group velocity was also investigated. The effect of
   the FSI was first validated by OCE measurements and FEM simulations on
   contact lenses, and the OCE and FEM results were in good agreement. The
   Young's modulus of the rabbit cornea before RGX was assessed as E=80
   kPa, and the shear viscosity was eta=0.40 Pa.s at an intraocular
   pressure (IOP) of 15 mmHg. After RGX, the Young's modulus increased to
   E=112 kPa and shear viscosity decreased to eta=0.37 Pa.s. Both the
   corneal OCE experiments and the FE simulations also demonstrated that
   the FSI significantly reduced the group velocity of the elastic wave,
   and thus, the FSI should be considered when determining the
   biomechanical properties of the cornea.}},

Abstract = {{Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States and
   is a recognized public health issue. Diagnosis of skin cancer involves
   biopsy of the suspicious lesion followed by histopathology. Biopsies,
   which involve excision of the lesion, are invasive, at times
   unnecessary, and are costly procedures (similar to\$2.8B/year in the
   US). An unmet critical need exists to develop a non-invasive and
   inexpensive screening method that can eliminate the need for unnecessary
   biopsies. To address this need, our group has reported on the continued
   development of a multimodal spectroscopy (MMS) system towards the goal
   of a spectral biopsy of skin. Our approach combines Raman spectroscopy,
   fluorescence spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to
   collect comprehensive optical property information from suspicious skin
   lesions. We describe our present efforts to develop an updated MMS
   system composed of OEM components that will be smaller, less expensive,
   and more clinic-friendly than the previous system. Key system design
   choices include the selection of miniature spectrometers, a
   fiber-coupled broadband light source, a fiber coupled diode laser, and a
   revised optical probe. Selection of these components results in a
   similar to 50\% reduction in system footprint, resulting in a more
   clinic-friendly system. We also present preliminary characterization
   data from the updated MMS system, showing similar performance with our
   revised optical probe design. Finally, we present in vivo skin
   measurements taken with the updated MMS system. Future work includes the
   initiation of a clinical study (n = 250) of the MMS system to
   characterize its performance in identifying skin cancers.}},

Title = {{Hybrid bilayer plasmonic metasurface efficiently manipulates visible
   light}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Metasurfaces operating in the cross-polarization scheme have shown an
   interesting degree of control over the wavefront of transmitted light.
   Nevertheless, their inherently low efficiency in visible light raises
   certain concerns for practical applications. Without sacrificing the
   ultrathin flat design, we propose a bilayer plasmonic metasurface
   operating at visible frequencies, obtained by coupling a
   nanoantenna-based metasurface with its complementary Babinet-inverted
   copy. By breaking the radiation symmetry because of the finite, yet
   small, thickness of the proposed structure and benefitting from properly
   tailored intra- and interlayer couplings, such coupled bilayer
   metasurface experimentally yields a conversion efficiency of 17\%,
   significantly larger than that of earlier single-layer designs, as well
   as an extinction ratio larger than 0 dB, meaning that anomalous
   refraction dominates the transmission response. Our finding shows that
   metallic metasurface can counterintuitively manipulate the visible light
   as efficiently as dielectric metasurface (similar to 20\% in conversion
   efficiency in Lin et al.'s study), although the metal's ohmic loss is
   much higher than dielectrics. Our hybrid bilayer design, still being
   ultrathin (similar to lambda/6), is found to obey generalized Snell's
   law even in the presence of strong couplings. It is capable of
   efficiently manipulating visible light over a broad bandwidth and can be
   realized with a facile one-step nanofabrication process.}},

Title = {{Monitoring protein synthesis in single live cancer cells}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{645-653}},
Abstract = {{Protein synthesis is generally under sophisticated and dynamic
   regulation to meet the ever-changing demands of a cell. Global up or
   down-regulation of protein synthesis and the shift of protein synthesis
   location (as shown, for example, during cellular stress or viral
   infection) are recognized as cellular responses to environmental changes
   such as nutrient/oxygen deprivation or to alterations such as
   pathological mutations in cancer cells. Monitoring protein synthesis in
   single live cells can be a powerful tool for cancer research. Here we
   employed a microfluidic platform to perform high throughput delivery of
   fluorescent labeled tRNAs into multiple myeloma cells with high
   transfection efficiency (similar to 45\%) and high viability (>80\%). We
   show that the delivered tRNAs were actively recruited to the ER for
   protein synthesis and that treatment with puromycin effectively
   disrupted this process. Interestingly, we observed the scattered
   distribution of tRNAs in cells undergoing mitosis, which has not been
   previously reported. Fluorescence lifetime analysis detected extensive
   FRET signals generated from tRNAs labeled as FRET pairs, further
   confirming that the delivered tRNAs were used by active ribosomes for
   protein translation. Our work demonstrates that the microfluidic
   delivery of FRET labeled tRNAs into living cancer cells can provide new
   insights into basic cancer metabolism and has the potential to serve as
   a platform for drug screening, diagnostics, or personalized medication.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a synthesis method of switching control policies for a class
   of shared autonomy systems in which control authority is held by either
   a human operator or an autonomous controller based on the state of the
   overall system. The objective is to optimize the system performance
   measured by the probability of satisfying a system specification in
   linear temporal logic, while ensuring a reasonable workload for the
   human operator. The synthesis method builds upon the construction of an
   abstract model for the given shared autonomy system from a set of
   components modeled by Markov decision processes, which are capable of
   capturing the uncertainty in the operator's performance and response to
   switching control signals under his different cognitive and
   physiological states. A cost function is then introduced to quantify the
   human operator's workload. In order to establish quantitative trade-offs
   between the operator's effort and the system performance, we propose a
   two-stage policy synthesis algorithm for generating Pareto-optimal
   switching control policies.}},

   medical images}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{When searching through volumetric images {[}e.g., computed tomography
   (CT)], radiologists appear to use two different search strategies:
   ``drilling{''} (restrict eye movements to a small region of the image
   while quickly scrolling through slices), or ``scanning{''} (search over
   large areas at a given depth before moving on to the next slice). To
   computationally identify the type of image information that is used in
   these two strategies, 23 naive observers were instructed with either
   ``drilling{''} or ``scanning{''} when searching for target T's in 20
   volumes of faux lung CTs. We computed saliency maps using both classical
   two-dimensional (2-D) saliency, and a three-dimensional (3-D) dynamic
   saliency that captures the characteristics of scrolling through slices.
   Comparing observers' gaze distributions with the saliency maps showed
   that search strategy alters the type of saliency that attracts
   fixations. Drillers' fixations aligned better with dynamic saliency and
   scanners with 2-D saliency. The computed saliency was greater for
   detected targets than for missed targets. Similar results were observed
   in data from 19 radiologists who searched five stacks of clinical chest
   CTs for lung nodules. Dynamic saliency may be superior to the 2-D
   saliency for detecting targets embedded in volumetric images, and thus
   ``drilling{''} may be more efficient than ``scanning.{''} (C) 2016

Title = {{NanoEHS - defining fundamental science needs: no easy feat when the

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-27}},
Abstract = {{Nanotechnology is no longer in its infancy and has made significant
   advances since the implementation of the National Nanotechnology
   Initiative (NNI) in 2000. Incorporation of nanotechnology in many fields
   including information technology, medicine, materials, energy, catalysis
   and cosmetics has led to an increase in engineered nanomaterial (ENM)
   production, and consequently, increased nanomaterial use. In comparison,
   the generation of concrete and consistent evidence related to the
   environmental health and safety of nanomaterials (NanoEHS) is lacking.
   The main factors contributing to the slower progress in NanoEHS versus
   conventional EHS are related to the complexity, property
   transformations, life cycles and behavior of nanomaterials even in
   carefully controlled environments. Therefore, new systematic, integrated
   research approaches in NanoEHS are needed for overcoming this complexity
   and bridging current knowledge gaps. A workshop on ``NanoEHS:
   Fundamental Science Needs{''} brought together scientists and engineers
   to identify current fundamental science challenges and opportunities
   within NanoEHS. Detailed discussions were conducted on identifying the
   fundamental properties that are critical in NanoEHS, differentiating
   between conventional and NanoEHS studies as well as understanding, the
   effect of dynamic transformations on nanometrology, role of dosimetry
   and mechanistic data gaps in nanotoxicology. An important realization
   that even simple nanoscale materials can be complex when considering
   NanoEHS implications was noted several times during the workshop.
   Despite this fact, a number of fundamental research areas to further the
   scientific foundation to address NanoEHS needs are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and scalable method has been developed for the synthesis of
   Co3O4-coated N-and B-doped graphene hollow spheres (Co3O4/NBGHSs). These
   Co3O4/NBGHSs are highly active for both oxygen reduction and evolution
   reactions and can exhibit higher electrocatalytic activities and better
   durability than commercial Pt/C and RuO2/C, respectively, demonstrating
   them to be efficient bi-functional electrocatalysts. In-depth analysis
   shows that the coupling between Co3O4 and NBGHSs, strong interaction
   with adsorbed O-2, high electric conductivity, and the specific hollow
   structure play important roles in imparting the higher electrocatalytic
   activities to the Co3O4/NBGHSs. When tested as cathode catalysts for
   Zn-air batteries, the Co3O4/NBGHSs exhibit better performance and higher
   stability than the Pt/C catalyst and other catalysts reported
   previously. This strongly suggests that the Co3O4/NBGHSs could be used
   as efficient electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries with great
   potential to replace precious metal/carbon based materials.}},

Abstract = {{We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of COads on
   Pt-147 dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs). In-situ
   electrochemical IR spectroscopy reveals an 8 cm(-1) redshift of the
   COads stretching frequency on Pt-147 DENs relative to a Pt(111) crystal.
   This value is in good agreement with the shift calculated by density
   functional theory. Importantly, the wavenumber shift observed in this
   study is significantly smaller than has been found previously. We
   attribute this primarily to the absence of support effects and the
   narrow size distribution of DENs. The agreement between experiment and
   theory validates the model nanoparticle system used for the
   calculations, and this will make it possible to use the COads frequency
   as a probe to study more complex DEN structures and as a descriptor of
   the catalytic activity of DENs toward reactions such as formic acid
   oxidation and methanol oxidation. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.}},

Abstract = {{The structural properties and gas permeation of a group of copolyimide
   membranes were investigated. The copolyimides used in this study were
   prepared using 3,3',4,4'-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA)
   and 4,4'-oxydianyline (ODA) as aromatic diaminens and
   4,9-dioxa-1,12-dodecanediamine (DODD),
   1,13-diamino-4,7,10-trioxatridecane (TODD) and
   1,8-diamino-3,6-dioxaoctane (DOO) as aliphatic diamines. Polymers were
   synthesized using random and block copolymerization methods via thermal
   imidization in a two step procedure. Reflectance-Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis
   (DMTA), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction
   analysis (XRD) have been performed to characterize the synthesized
   copolyimides. The copolyimide with BTDA-ODA diamines showed higher T-g
   compared to the other polymers due to its fully aromatic structure. Gas
   permeation results reveal that the type of aliphatic diamines and
   polymer morphology can greatly affect the permeability of membranes for
   pure CO2, CH4, O-2 and N-2 gases. The gas permeability and selectivity
   of random copolyimides were higher than those of block copolyimides. The
   effects of temperature and feed pressure were also investigated. The
   permeability of all gases decreases slightly with increasing pressure.
   The results revealed that an increase in the temperature of the polymer
   matrix is able to increase the diffusivity and permeability of the
   membrane.}},

Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{87-96}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to improve the quality of
   additive manufactured optically translucent parts by investigating the
   manufacturing issues, analyzing lithophane production criteria and
   identifying the best translucent material and additive manufacturing
   (AM) technology.
   Design/methodology/approach - Figured lithophanes were laser sintered on
   a 3D Systems SinterStation (R) HiQ (TM) with varying layer thickness and
   plate thickness. Laser sintered (LS) polyamide (PA) 12 blanks were
   cyanoacrylate infiltrated and polished. Optical properties and
   performance were compared with the original LS blanks. Lithophanes and
   blanks were manufactured using 3D systems stereo lithography apparatus
   (SLA)(R) Viper (TM) si2 station, and optical properties and lithophane
   performance were compared with the LS specimens.
   Findings - When building in the XY plane, it is optimal to sinter with
   the minimum layer thickness (0.076 mm) and maximum plate thickness (5
   mm). Cyanoacrylate infiltration and polishing assists in reducing the LS
   PA 12 plate surface roughness, but polishing does not affect the
   lithophane performance. The best LS candidate should have an absorption
   coefficient of 0.5/mm using a white light source. Improved resolution
   but reduced contrast was observed on stereolithography (SL) specimens
   compared to LS parts.
   Research limitations/implications - Transmittance experiments were
   performed on three SL parts which was not sufficient for optical
   property calculation. Limited literature was found for new material
   exploration.
   Originality/value - It is the first effort to study systematically
   quality improvement issues of LS PA optically translucent parts. A
   comparison is made of optical performance between parts made using LS
   and SL.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to analyze the additive manufacturing
   orientation effect of laser sintered polyamide 12 (PA 12) optically
   translucent parts.
   Design/methodology/approach - Plates with small features, wedges and
   lithophanes were laser sintered on a SinterStation HiQ (TM) in different
   orientations using PA 12. Lithophane performance was assessed using a
   Picker 240050 X-ray view/light box. All parts were examined using
   stereomicroscopy to capture the small features.
   Findings - The quality of the lithophane image was substantially
   improved by orienting the flat plate side to the incident backlit light.
   Sintering in the ZX/ZY plane significantly increased the contrast and
   resolution compared to sintering in the XY plane. The thinnest feature
   thickness possible in the SinterStation HiQ is in the XY plane 0.13 mm,
   and it is 0.57 mm when manufacturing in the ZX/ZY plane.
   Research limitations/implications - The laser spot size and other
   machine parameters were not changeable, which limited the manufacturing
   resolution. Oblique, non-orthogonal orientations were not investigated.
   Originality/value - This is a first effort to investigate the
   manufacturing orientation effect of laser sintered polyamide optically
   translucent parts. The manufacturing resolutions on different planes
   were defined.}},

Abstract = {{Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) devices are popular energy converters due to
   providing low noise, low thermal mechanical stresses and portability.
   The conversion efficiency of TPVs is still low due to mistuned spectral
   properties between thermal selective emitters and the TPV cell. Using
   thermal selective emitters that are well-matched to the TPV cell
   spectrum enhances the conversion efficiency of TPVs. Several thermal
   selective emitters, composed of 1-D complex multilayer structures with
   rectangular gratings, have been proposed. Cost, fabrication and
   stability factors have been major problems for their application on TPV
   modules. In this paper, a 1-D tungsten thermal emitter is optimized
   which exhibits close to blackbody emittance near the band-gap of a
   GaInAsSb TPV cell and sharp cutoff for longer wavelengths. The emitter
   is at 1200K, and is designed and optimized by modeling triangular
   grooves to excite localized groove modes which are well-matched to the
   GaInAsSb TPV cell external quantum efficiency (EQE) for high efficiency
   energy conversion. We suggest that a quasi monochromatic, narrow-band
   and coherent emitter at a frequency near the energy band-gap of the
   converter is an ideal source to achieve high conversion efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{K-12 engineering is a critical platform for achieving integrated
   science, technology, engineering, and math STEM teaching and learning in
   the Unites States. This has fueled research in the development and

   contrasting ways in which a prescribed curriculum is translated into
   practice. The study examines the implementation of 12-week secondary
   engineering unit (helmet design) by a teacher with high content
   knowledge in engineering in a rural/suburban school with 20 students.
   The unit was designed with significant input from a university-based
   team including content experts, learning scientists, master teachers,
   classroom teachers, and school district administrators as part of a
   grant focused on the creation of a high school engineering course. Five
   strands were identified in the unit for analysis: assessment,
   activities, apparatus, technology, and standards. Findings indicate much
   alignment with apparatus, standards, and technology strands and
   disparity within the assessment and activities strands between the
   prescribed unit and its enactment in the course by the teacher.}},

Abstract = {{Super P-Li is widely used in compounding experimental Li ion battery
   anodes and cathodes. Here we show that substitution of Super P-Li with a

   about 3 mu m wide) nitrogen-doped templated (NDT) carbon of 1740 m(2)/g
   surface area with 4 nm pore size improves the performance of an
   experimental Li ion battery anode, utilizing alpha-Fe2O3 (hematite)
   nanorods as an example active material for testing this mixed carbon
   based electrode architecture. It is proposed that while Super P-Li
   provides the essential electronic conduction of the composite electrode,

Abstract = {{Here we present a very fast, selective mechanical approach for
   transferring graphene with low levels of copper contamination from seed
   wafers on which it was grown to target wafers for very large scale
   integration (VLSI) electronics. We found that graphene/copper or
   copper/silicon oxide delamination paths could be selected by slow and
   faster separation rates, respectively. Thus graphene can be transferred
   to a target wafer, either exposed or protected by the seed copper layer,
   which can later be removed by etching. Delamination paths were
   identified by SEM and Raman spectroscopy. The sheet resistance of the
   graphene produced by the two approaches was slightly higher than
   graphene transferred by a PMMA wet-transfer process, indicating reduced
   impurity doping, and the variation in the sheet resistance values was
   much lower. Copper contamination levels, quantitatively established by
   TOF-SIMS, were several orders of magnitude lower than the values for
   PMMA assisted transfer. In addition, we demonstrated that top-gated
   transistor devices from our mechanical, delamination transferred
   graphene exhibited superior transistor behavior to PMMA-assisted wet
   transfer graphene. The adhesion energy, strength and range of the
   interactions were quantitatively determined by nonlinear fracture
   analyses, and suggest that the roughness of the interface between
   graphene and copper plays an important role with implications for
   improvements in manufacturing processes.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling of graphene-based materials with metal oxide nanostructures is
   an effective way to obtain composites with improved gas sensing
   properties. In this work, we prepared a hybrid structure based on

   been investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction
   spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and Raman spectroscopy.
   The gas sensing properties of the obtained structure have been studied
   towards nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen and methane at relatively low (about
   200 degrees C) operating temperatures. It has been demonstrated that the
   reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/ZnO composites exhibit 40-50\% better
   response to NO2 and H-2 compared to pure ZnO sensors. The obtained
   results show that the functionalization of the nanostructured ZnO with

Abstract = {{Using a mass transfer model and the volatility basis set, we estimate
   the volatility distribution for the organic aerosol (OA) components
   during summer and winter in Paris, France as part of the collaborative
   project MEGAPOLI. The concentrations of the OA components as a function
   of temperature were measured combining data from a thermodenuder and an
   aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF)
   analysis. The hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) had similar
   volatility distributions for the summer and winter campaigns with half
   of the material in the saturation concentration bin of 10 mu g m(-3) and
   another 35-40\% consisting of low and extremely low volatility organic
   compounds (LVOCs with effective saturation concentrations C{*} of
   10(-3)-0.1 mu g m(-3) and ELVOCs C{*} less or equal than 10(-4) mu g
   m(-3), respectively). The winter cooking OA (COA) was more than an order
   of magnitude less volatile than the summer COA. The low-volatility
   oxygenated OA (LV-OOA) factor detected in the summer had the lowest
   volatility of all the derived factors and consisted almost exclusively
   of ELVOCs. The volatility for the semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA)
   was significantly higher than that of the LV-OOA, containing both
   semi-volatile organic components (SVOCs with C{*} in the 1-100 mu g
   m(-3) range) and LVOCs. The oxygenated OA (OOA) factor in winter
   con-sisted of SVOCs (45 \%), LVOCs (25 \%) and ELVOCs (30 \%). The
   volatility of marine OA (MOA) was higher than that of the other factors
   containing around 60\% SVOCs. The biomass burning OA (BBOA) factor
   contained components with a wide range of volatilities with significant
   contributions from both SVOCs (50 \%) and LVOCs (30 \%). Finally,
   combining the bulk average O:C ratios and volatility distributions of
   the various factors, our results are placed into the two-dimensional
   volatility basis set (2D-VBS) framework. The OA factors cover a broad
   spectrum of volatilities with no direct link between the average
   volatility and average O:C of the OA components.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-particle partitioning and hydrolysis of organic nitrates (ON)
   influences their role as sinks and sources of NOx and their effects on
   the formation of tropospheric ozone and organic aerosol (OA). In this
   work, organic nitrates were formed from the photo-oxidation of
   alpha-pinene in environmental chamber experiments under different
   conditions. Particle-phase ON hydrolysis rates, consistent with observed
   ON decay, exhibited a nonlinear dependence on relative humidity (RH): an
   ON decay rate of 2 day(-1) was observed when the RH ranged between 20
   and 60 \%, and no significant ON decay was observed at RH lower than 20
   \%. In experiments when the highest observed RH exceeded the
   deliquescence RH of the ammonium sulfate seed aerosol, the
   particle-phase ON decay rate was as high as 7 day 1 and more variable.
   The ON gas-particle partitioning was dependent on total OA concentration
   and temperature, consistent with absorptive partitioning theory. In a
   volatility basis set, the ON partitioning was consistent with mass
   fractions of {[}0 0.11 0.03 0.86] at saturation mass concentrations
   (C{*}) of {[}1 10 100 1000] mu g m(-3).}},

Abstract = {{Our hands and fingers are involved in almost all activities of daily
   living and, as such, have a disproportionately large neural
   representation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging investigations
   into the neural control of the hand have revealed great advances, but
   the harsh MRI environment has proven to be a challenge to devices
   capable of delivering a large variety of stimuli necessary for
   well-controlled studies. This paper presents a fMRI-compatible haptic
   interface to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying precision
   grasp control. The interface, located at the scanner bore, is controlled
   remotely through a shielded electromagnetic actuation system positioned
   at the end of the scanner bed and then through a high stiffness, low
   inertia cable transmission. We present the system design, taking into
   account requirements defined by the biomechanics and dynamics of the
   human hand, as well as the fMRI environment. Performance evaluation
   revealed a structural stiffness of 3.3 N/ mm, renderable forces up to 94
   N, and a position control bandwidth of at least 19 Hz. MRI-compatibility
   tests showed no degradation in the operation of the haptic interface or
   the image quality. A preliminary fMRI experiment during a pilot study
   validated the usability of the haptic interface, illustrating the
   possibilities offered by this device.}},

Abstract = {{Conventionally, the assessment of reinforced concrete shear walls relies
   on manual visual assessment which is time-consuming and depends heavily
   on the skills of the inspectors. The development of automated assessment
   employing flying and crawling robots equipped with high-resolution
   cameras and wireless communications to acquire digital images and
   advance image processing to extract crack patterns has paved the path
   toward implementing an automated system which determines structural
   damage based on visual signals acquired from structures. Since there are
   few, if any, studies to correlate crack patterns to structural
   integrity, this article proposes to analyze crack patterns using a
   multifractal analysis. The approach is initially tested on synthetic
   crack patterns, and then it is applied to a set of experimental data
   collected during the testing of two large-scale reinforced concrete
   shear wall subjected to controlled reversed cyclic loading. The
   structural response data available for each specimen are used to link
   the multifractal parameters with the structural performance of the two
   specimens. A relationship between the multifractal parameters and the
   crack patterns' evolution and mechanism is noted. The results show that
   as the crack patterns extend and grow, multifractal parameters move
   toward higher values. The parameters jump as the mechanical response
   shows severe stiffness loss. In this study, no attempt is made to
   automate the process of mapping cracks from images.}},

Abstract = {{On-board magnetic resonance (MR) image guidance during radiation therapy
   offers the potential for more accurate treatment delivery. To utilize
   the real-time image information, a crucial prerequisite is the ability
   to successfully segment and track regions of interest (ROI). The purpose
   of this work is to evaluate the performance of different segmentation
   algorithms using motion images (4 frames per second) acquired using a MR
   image-guided radiotherapy (MR-IGRT) system. Manual contours of the
   kidney, bladder, duodenum, and a liver tumor by an experienced radiation
   oncologist were used as the ground truth for performance evaluation.
   Besides the manual segmentation, images were automatically segmented
   using thresholding, fuzzy k-means (FKM), k-harmonic means (KHM), and
   reaction-diffusion level set evolution (RD-LSE) algorithms, as well as
   the tissue tracking algorithm provided by the ViewRay treatment planning
   and delivery system (VR-TPDS). The performance of the five algorithms
   was evaluated quantitatively by comparing with the manual segmentation
   using the Dice coefficient and target registration error (TRE) measured
   as the distance between the centroid of the manual ROI and the centroid
   of the automatically segmented ROI. All methods were able to
   successfully segment the bladder and the kidney, but only FKM, KHM, and
   VR-TPDS were able to segment the liver tumor and the duodenum. The
   performance of the thresholding, FKM, KHM, and RD-LSE algorithms
   degraded as the local image contrast decreased, whereas the performance
   of the VP-TPDS method was nearly independent of local image contrast due
   to the reference registration algorithm. For segmenting high-contrast
   images (i.e., kidney), the thresholding method provided the best speed
   (<1 ms) with a satisfying accuracy (Dice = 0.95). When the image
   contrast was low, the VR-TPDS method had the best automatic contour.
   Results suggest an image quality determination procedure before
   segmentation and a combination of different methods for optimal
   segmentation with the on-board MR-IGRT system.}},

Abstract = {{The transfer of monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition on
   Cu foils is essential in developing graphene-based devices. However, the
   traditional polymer-assisted transfer method does not preserve the
   intrinsic properties of graphene, as polymeric residue creates
   interference. Here, we report the use of an alkane hydrocarbon as a
   supporting material for the development of a cleaner graphene
   transferring method. Compared to the use of poly(methyl methacrylate),
   the use of octadecane generated much less residue on the graphene's
   surface, as confirmed by lateral force microscopy and Raman
   spectroscopy. Furthermore, back gated graphene transistors fabricated
   using the octadecane-assisted transfer showed less p-type doping with
   higher carrier mobility in air than those with a polymer-based method.
   The alkane hydrocarbon-based transfer method presents an alternative
   device fabrication route, which provides a cleaner graphene surface.}},

Pages = {{948-954}},
Abstract = {{Precursors of the crystalline antiperovskites A(3-x)H(x)OCl (A = Li or
   Na and 0 < x < 1) can be rendered glass/amorphous solid Li+ or Na+
   electrolytes by the addition of water to its solvation limit
   with/without the addition of a small amount of an oxide or hydroxide.
   The solvated water is evaporated as HCl and 2(OH)(-) = O2- + H2O. The
   O2- attracts a Li+ or Na+ to form dipoles; the remaining Li+ or Na+ are
   mobile. The Li+ or Na+ ionic conductivities of the glass/amorphous
   solids have activation energies Delta H-m < 0.1 eV and a
   room-temperature conductivity comparable to that of the best organic
   liquid electrolytes. Measurements of the dielectric loss tangent versus
   frequency show two overlapping resonances at room temperature with the
   Ba-doped Li-glass; they are nearly overlapping at temperatures 41
   degrees C < T < 141 degrees C in the Ba-doped Na-glass. Galvanostatic
   charging of a symmetric Cu/Na-glass/Cu cell for 1 h showed a remarkable
   self-charge on switching to open circuit; charging for 15 h followed by
   discharging at an applied -0.1 mA of the symmetric cell showed, in the
   discharge mode, a replating of sodium on the anode at a positive cell
   current of +0.07 mA for over 15 h. A model for these behaviors is
   proposed. A symmetric Li/Li-glass/Li cell was cycled to demonstrate
   plating of Li on a current collector from the Li-glass electrolyte.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{A243-A272}},
Abstract = {{We address the problem of optimal experimental design (OED) for Bayesian
   nonlinear inverse problems governed by partial differential equations
   (PDEs). The inverse problem seeks to infer an infinite-dimensional
   parameter from experimental data observed at a set of sensor locations
   and from the governing PDEs. The goal of the OED problem is to find an
   optimal placement of sensors so as to minimize the uncertainty in the
   inferred parameter field. Specifically, we seek an optimal subset of
   sensors from among a fixed set of candidate sensor locations. We
   formulate the OED objective function by generalizing the classical
   A-optimal experimental design criterion using the expected value of the
   trace of the posterior covariance. This expected value is computed
   through sample averaging over the set of likely experimental data. To
   cope with the infinite-dimensional character of the parameter field, we
   construct a Gaussian approximation to the posterior at the maximum a
   posteriori probability (MAP) point, and use the resulting covariance
   operator to define the OED objective function. We use randomized trace
   estimation to compute the trace of this covariance operator, which is
   defined only implicitly. The resulting OED problem includes as
   constraints the system of PDEs characterizing the MAP point, and the
   PDEs describing the action of the covariance (of the Gaussian
   approximation to the posterior) to vectors. We control the sparsity of
   the sensor configurations using sparsifying penalty functions.
   Variational adjoint methods are used to efficiently compute the gradient
   of the PDE-constrained OED objective function. We elaborate our OED
   method for the problem of determining the optimal sensor configuration
   to best infer the coefficient of an elliptic PDE. Furthermore, we
   provide numerical results for inference of the log permeability field in
   a porous medium flow problem. Numerical results show that the number of
   PDE solves required for the evaluation of the OED objective function and
   its gradient is essentially independent of both the parameter dimension
   and the sensor dimension (i.e., the number of candidate sensor
   locations). The number of quasi-Newton iterations for computing an OED
   also exhibits the same dimension invariance properties.}},

Abstract = {{Porous n-type Fe2V4O13 films on FTO substrates were prepared by a
   simplified successive ion layer adsorption and reaction method and
   characterized as photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water
   oxidation. Synthesis parameters such as film thickness and annealing
   temperatures and durations were investigated to optimize the PEC
   performance. A band gap of similar to 2.3 eV and a flat band potential
   of 0.5 V vs. RHE make Fe2V4O13 a promising photoanode material. Water
   oxidation was kinetically limited at the surface of Fe2V4O13 film as
   confirmed by tests in electrolyte with a hole scavenger (Na2SO3).
   Improved PEC performance was achieved by Mo and W doping because of
   enhanced carrier densities. The best performance was obtained by 2.5\%
   W-doped Fe2V4O13 films (actual 0.8\% W-doped), which efficiently oxidize
   water to O-2 via photogenerated holes as confirmed by oxygen evolution
   measurements. Moreover, the Fe2V4O13 photoanode displayed very stable
   photocurrent under illumination. Due to the suitable band gap and
   valence band position, Fe2V4O13 is a promising photoanode for solar
   water splitting. Co-catalyst loading and doping optimization are
   identified as routes to improve this material's performance further.}},

Title = {{A Spinel-Integrated P2-Type Layered Composite: High-Rate Cathode for
   Sodium-Ion Batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{A584-A591}},
Abstract = {{Sodium-ion batteries (SIB) are being intensively investigated, owing to
   the natural abundance and low cost of Na resources. However, the SIBs
   still suffer from poor rate capability due to the large ionic radius of
   Na+ ion and the significant kinetic barrier to Na+-ion transport. Here,
   we present an Fd-3m spinel-integrated P2-type layered composite (P2 +
   Fd-3m) material as a high-rate cathode for SIBs. The P2 + Fd-3m
   composite material Na0.50Ni1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 shows significantly enhanced
   discharge capacity, energy density, and rate capability as compared to
   the pure P2-type counterpart. The composite delivers a high capacity of
   85 mA h g(-1) when discharging at a very high current density of 1500 mA
   g(-1) (10 C rate) between 2.0 and 4.5 V, validating it as a promising
   cathode candidate for high-power SIBs. The superior performance is
   ascribed to the improved kinetics in the presence of the
   integrated-spinel phase, which facilitates fast electron transport to
   coordinate with the timely Na+-ion insertion/extraction. The findings of
   this work also shed light on the importance of developing lattice
   doping, surface coating, and electrolyte additives to further improve
   the structural and interfacial stability of P2-type cathode materials
   and fully realize their practical applications in sodium-ion batteries.

Abstract = {{Confined gas-liquid droplet microflows present a lot of new perspectives
   for microfluidic systems that require the presence of a gaseous phase.
   In addition to the benefits associated with the discretization of
   reactive and sensing processes, the highly inertial droplets generated
   in these systems can enable fast efficient mixing by pair collisions as
   well as high system throughput due to the short convective timescales
   involved in the droplet transport. Presented herein is mapping of the
   geometry-specific droplet generation from a binary gas-liquid flow for
   different flow-focusing configurations. The dynamic interactions of
   inertia, shear stress, viscous and surface tension forces create three
   unique regimes in the gas-liquid flow rate space, providing adaptable
   flow configuration to specific applications. Analytical investigation
   and numerical analyses involving governing forces are also introduced to
   predict the effective droplet diameter versus gas flow rate. We found
   that the experimental results were well matched to the analytical
   predictions within 10 \% of uncertainty.}},

   ligands in highly concentrated brines including divalent ions}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2025-2039}},
Abstract = {{Whereas numerous studies of stabilization of nanoparticles (NPs) in
   electrolytes have examined biological fluids, the interest has grown
   recently in media with much higher ionic strengths including seawater
   and brines relevant to environmental science and subsurface oil and gas
   reservoirs. Given that electrostatic repulsion is limited at extremely
   high ionic strengths due to charge screening, we have identified ligands
   that are well solvated in concentrated brine containing divalent cations
   and thus provide steric stabilization of silica nanoparticles.
   Specifically, the hydrodynamic diameter of silica nanoparticles with
   grafted low molecular weight ligands, a diol ether,
   {[}3-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy) propyl]trimethoxysilane, and a zwitterionic
   sulfobetaine,
   3-({[}dimethyl(3-trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonio)propane-1-sulfonate, is
   shown with dynamic light scattering to remain essentially constant,
   indicating lack of aggregation, at room temperature and up to 80 degrees
   C for over 30 days. An extended DLVO model signifies that steric
   stabilization is strongly dominant against van der Waals attraction for
   similar to 10 nm particles given that these ligands are well solvated
   even in highly concentrated brine. In contrast, polyethylene glycol
   oligomers do not provide steric stabilization at elevated temperatures,
   even at conditions where the ligands are soluble, indicating
   complicating factors including bridging of the ether oxygens by divalent
   cations.}},

Title = {{The impact of physiological crowding on the diffusivity of membrane
   bound proteins}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2127-2134}},
Abstract = {{Diffusion of transmembrane and peripheral membrane-bound proteins within
   the crowded cellular membrane environment is essential to diverse
   biological processes including cellular signaling, endocytosis, and
   motility. Nonetheless we presently lack a detailed understanding of the
   influence of physiological levels of crowding on membrane protein
   diffusion. Utilizing quantitative in vitro measurements, here we
   demonstrate that the diffusivities of membrane bound proteins follow a
   single linearly decreasing trend with increasing membrane coverage by
   proteins. This trend holds for homogenous protein populations across a
   range of protein sizes and for heterogeneous mixtures of proteins of
   different sizes, such that protein diffusivity is controlled by the
   total coverage of the surrounding membrane. These results demonstrate
   that steric exclusion within the crowded membrane environment can
   fundamentally limit the diffusive rate of proteins, regardless of their
   size. In cells this ``speed limit'' could be modulated by changes in
   local membrane coverage, providing a mechanism for tuning the rate of
   molecular interaction and assembly.}},

   interfacial deformations}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2751-2767}},
Abstract = {{We observed that imbibition of various Rhodamine B-doped wetting liquids
   in an array of different-sized, horizontal, two-dimensional silica
   nanochannels terminated within the channels as a function of hydraulic
   diameter and liquid type. This front termination is not predicted by the
   classic Washburn equation for capillary flow, which establishes
   diffusive dynamics in horizontal channels. Various explanations for the
   anomalous static imbibition measurements were negated; hydrodynamics,
   thermodynamics, surface chemistry and mechanics were all taken into
   consideration for this analysis. The atypical imbibition data are
   explained by deformed menisci and decreased effective channel diameters.
   These occurrences are due to the enhanced influence of the following
   phenomena at the nanoscale: surface forces at fluid-solid boundaries,
   the presence of quasi-crystalline thin films or boundary regions, and
   potential solid surface or boundary layer deformation due to
   meniscus-induced negative pressures (suction). We introduce a
   phenomenological model which demonstrates how van der Waals forces,
   common to all interfaces, lead to local menisci deformation and an
   average reduction in capillary pressure. An expression for the
   approximate capillary pressure of a symmetric nanoscale meniscus in a
   cylindrical pore space is derived; its difference from the macroscopic
   capillary pressure can be expressed by an effective contact angle.
   Precursor films, adsorbed films and elastocapillary deformation decrease
   effective diameter, exacerbating meniscus deformation and increases in
   effective viscosity; we also describe local models and effective values
   for these phenomena. The findings can be scaled to imbibition and
   two-phase flow in nanoporous media.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{123-134}},

Abstract = {{Single-molecule studies in which a mechanical force is transmitted to
   the molecule of interest and the molecular extension or position is
   monitored as a function of time are versatile tools for probing the
   dynamics of protein folding, stepping of molecular motors, and other
   biomolecular processes involving activated barrier crossing. One
   complication in interpreting such studies, however, is the fact that the
   typical size of a force probe (e.g., a dielectric bead in optical
   tweezers or the atomic force microscope tip/cantilever assembly) is much
   larger than the molecule itself, and so the observed molecular motion is
   affected by the hydrodynamic drag on the probe. This presents the
   experimenter with a nontrivial task of deconvolving the intrinsic
   molecular parameters, such as the intrinsic free energy barrier and the
   effective diffusion coefficient exhibited while crossing the barrier
   from the experimental signal. Here we focus on the dynamical aspect of
   this task and show how the intrinsic diffusion coefficient along the
   molecular reaction coordinate can be inferred from single-molecule
   measurements of the rates of biomolecular folding and unfolding. We show
   that the feasibility of accomplishing this task is strongly dependent on
   the relationship between the intrinsic molecular elasticity and that of
   the linker connecting the molecule to the force probe and identify the
   optimal range of instrumental parameters allowing determination of
   instrument-free molecular dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Switches form a special class of proteins that dramatically change their
   three-dimensional structures upon a small perturbation. One possible
   perturbation that we explore is that of a single point mutation.
   Building on the pioneering experimental work of Alexander et al.
   (Alexander et al. PNAS, 2007; 104,11963-11968) that determines switch
   sequences between a and alpha+beta folds we conduct a comprehensive
   sequence sampling by a Markov Chain with multiple fitness criteria to
   identify new switches given the experimental folds. We screen for switch
   sequences using a combination of contact potential, secondary structure
   prediction, and finally molecular dynamics simulations. Statistical
   properties of switch sequences are discussed and illustrated to be most
   sensitive to mutation at the N- and C-termini of the switch protein.
   Based on this analysis, a particularly stable putative switch pair is
   identified and proposed for further experimental analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicles have the potential to improve link and intersection
   traffic behavior. Computer reaction times may admit reduced following
   headways and increase capacity and backwards wave speed. The degree of
   these improvements will depend on the proportion of autonomous vehicles
   in the network. To model arbitrary shared road scenarios, we develop a
   multiclass cell transmission model that admits variations in capacity
   and backwards wave speed in response to class proportions within each
   cell. The multiclass cell transmission model is shown to be consistent
   with the hydrodynamic theory. This paper then develops a car following
   model incorporating driver reaction time to predict capacity and
   backwards wave speed for multiclass scenarios. For intersection
   modeling, we adapt the legacy early method for intelligent traffic
   management (Bento et al., 2013) to general simulation-based dynamic
   traffic assignment models. Empirical results on a city network show that
   intersection controls are a major bottleneck in the model, and that the
   legacy early method improves over traffic signals when the autonomous
   vehicle proportion is sufficiently high. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Screening Criteria and Considerations of Offshore Enhanced Oil Recovery}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The application of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in offshore oil fields
   has received significant attention due to the potentially enormous
   amount of recoverable oil. However, EOR application offshore is in its
   very early stage due to conditions that are more complex than onshore
   oil fields, owing to the unique parameters present offshore. Therefore,
   successful EOR applications in offshore oil fields require different
   screening criteria than those for conventional onshore applications. A
   comprehensive database for onshore applications of EOR processes
   together with a limited offshore EOR application database are analyzed
   in this paper, and the important parameters for successful offshore
   application are incorporated into the new EOR screening criteria. In
   this paper, screening criteria to determine acceptable EOR processes for
   offshore fields, including hydrocarbon gas miscible, CO2 miscible, and
   polymer processes, are presented. Suggested screening criteria for these
   EOR processes comprise quantitative boundaries and qualitative
   considerations. Quantitative screening criteria are predominantly based
   on quantifiable data, such as oil and reservoir properties. Qualitative
   screening considerations mainly focus on the operational issues present
   offshore, including platform space constraints, limited disposal
   options, injectant availability, and flow assurance matters (including
   hydrate formation and difficulties in emulsion separation).}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of matrix completion when some number
   of the columns are completely and arbitrarily corrupted, potentially by
   a malicious adversary. It is well known that standard algorithms for
   matrix completion can return arbitrarily poor results, if even a single
   column is corrupted. One direct application comes from robust
   collaborative filtering. Here, some number of users are so-called
   manipulators who try to skew the predictions of the algorithm by
   calibrating their inputs to the system. In this paper, we develop an
   efficient algorithm for this problem based on a combination of a
   trimming procedure and a convex program that minimizes the nuclear norm
   and the l(1,2) norm. Our theoretical results show that given a vanishing
   fraction of observed entries, it is nevertheless possible to complete
   the underlying matrix even when the number of corrupted columns grows.
   Significantly, our results hold without any assumptions on the locations
   or values of the observed entries of the manipulated columns. Moreover,
   we show by an information-theoretic argument that our guarantees are
   nearly optimal in terms of the fraction of sampled entries on the
   authentic columns, the fraction of corrupted columns, and the rank of
   the underlying matrix. Our results therefore sharply characterize the
   tradeoffs between sample, robustness, and rank in matrix completion.}},

Abstract = {{Chemically integrated hierarchical microsphere ZnCo2O4/reduced graphene
   oxide hybrid composites are synthesized via a polyol process.
   Microsphere ZnCo2O4 particles embedded in graphene homogeneously with
   sizes in the region of 320-512 nm, graphene sheets grew and interwove
   inversely in the inside of the microsphere ZnCo2O4 particles, so that
   the structure possesses a unique microsphere-sheet hybrid structure. The
   interconnected graphene conductive network basic skeleton is beneficial
   to the transportation of Li+ and electrons. Compared with the
   conventional way metal oxides and graphene combine, hierarchical
   microsphere ZnCo2O4/reduced graphene oxide hybrid composites exhibit
   enhanced rate capability (469.7 mA h g(-1) at 4000 mA g(-1)) and long
   term cycling ability with high capability (904.2 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA
   g(-1) over 500 charge/discharge cycles), owing to the special
   characteristic of a three-dimensional structure. Most importantly, with
   the successful synthesis of the hierarchical microsphere ZnCo2O4/reduced
   graphene oxide hybrid composites, this facile strategy can extend to the
   synthesis of the ternary transition metal oxides/reduced graphene oxide
   with hierarchical microsphere structure and make it possible to explore

   The F-SAM introduced in the transfer process can also lead to graphene

Title = {{High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with a Self-Supported, 3D
   Li2S-Doped Graphene Aerogel Cathodes}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are being considered as the
   next-generation high-energy-storage system due to their high theoretical
   energy density. However, the use of a lithium-metal anode poses serious
   safety concerns due to lithium dendrite formation, which causes
   short-circuiting, and possible explosions of the cell. One feasible way
   to address this issue is to pair a fully lithiated lithium sulfide
   (Li2S) cathode with lithium metal-free anodes. However, bulk Li2S
   particles face the challenges of having a large activation barrier
   during the initial charge, low active-material utilization, poor
   electrical conductivity, and fast capacity fade, preventing their
   practical utility. Here, the development of a self-supported, high
   capacity, long-life cathode material is presented for Li-S batteries by
   coating Li2S onto doped graphene aerogels via a simple liquid
   infiltration-evaporation coating method. The resultant cathodes are able
   to lower the initial charge voltage barrier and attain a high specific
   capacity, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability. The
   improved performance can be attributed to the (i) cross-linked, porous
   graphene network enabling fast electron/ion transfer, (ii) coated Li2S
   on graphene with high utilization and a reduced energy barrier, and
   (iii) doped heteroatoms with a strong binding affinity toward
   Li2S/lithium polysulfides with reduced polysulfi de dissolution based on
   first-principles calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of a carbazole-derived, well-defined ladder polymer was
   achieved under thermodynamic control by employing reversible
   ring-closing olefin metathesis. This unique approach featured mild
   conditions and excellent efficiency, affording the ladder polymer
   backbone with minimum levels of unreacted defects. Rigorous NMR analysis
   on a C-13 isotope-enriched product revealed that the main-chain
   contained less than 1\% of unreacted precursory vinyl groups. The rigid
   conformation of the ladder-type backbone was confirmed by photophysical
   analysis, while the extended rod-like structure was visualized under
   scanning tunneling microscope. Excellent solubility of this polymer in
   common organic solvents allowed for feasible processing of thin films
   using solution-casting techniques. Atomic force microscopy and grazing
   incident X-ray scattering revealed a uniform and amorphous morphology of
   these films, in sharp contrast to the polycrystalline thin films of its
   small molecular counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{In fire models, the accurate prediction of aerosol and soot

Abstract = {{Ocean data assimilation brings together observations with known dynamics
   encapsulated in a circulation model to describe the time-varying ocean
   circulation. Its applications are manifold, ranging from marine and
   ecosystem forecasting to climate prediction and studies of the carbon

   improving our understanding of ocean circulation to estimating initial
   or boundary conditions and model parameters for ocean and climate
   forecasts. Because of differences in underlying methodologies, data
   assimilation products must be used judiciously and selected according to
   the specific purpose, as not all related inferences would be equally
   reliable. Further advances are expected from improved models and methods
   for estimating and representing error information in data assimilation
   systems. Ultimately, data assimilation into coupled climate system
   components is needed to support ocean and climate services. However,
   maintaining the infrastructure and expertise for sustained data
   assimilation remains challenging.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for designing base station (BS) clusters
   and cluster patterns for pair-wise BS coordination. The key idea is that
   each BS cluster is formed by using the second-order Voronoi region, and
   the BS clusters are assigned to a specific cluster pattern by using
   edge-coloring for a graph drawn by Delaunay triangulation. The main
   advantage of the proposed method is that the BS selection conflict
   problem is prevented, while users are guaranteed to communicate with
   their two closest BSs in any irregular BS topology. With the proposed
   coordination method, analytical expressions for the rate distribution
   and the ergodic spectral efficiency are derived as a function of
   relevant system parameters in a fixed irregular network model. In a
   random network model with a homogeneous Poisson point process, a lower
   bound on the ergodic spectral efficiency is characterized. Through
   system level simulations, the performance of the proposed method is
   compared with that of conventional coordination methods: dynamic
   clustering and static clustering. Our major finding is that, when users
   are dense enough in a network, the proposed method provides the same
   level of coordination benefit with dynamic clustering to edge users.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A method for the synthesis of electroactive polymers is demonstrated,
   starting with the synthesis of extended conjugation monomers using a
   three-step process that finishes with Negishi coupling. Negishi coupling
   is a cross-coupling process in which a chemical precursor is first
   lithiated, followed by transmetallation with ZnCl2. The resultant
   organozinc compound can be coupled to a dibrominated aromatic precursor
   to give the conjugated monomer. Polymer films can be prepared via
   electropolymerization of the monomer and characterized using cyclic
   voltammetry and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR)
   spectroscopy. Nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared via emulsion
   polymerization of the monomer using a two-surfactant system to yield an
   aqueous dispersion of the polymer NPs. The NPs are characterized using
   dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and
   UV-Vis-NIR-spectroscopy. Cytocompatibility of NPs is investigated using
   the cell viability assay. Finally, the NP suspensions are irradiated
   with a NIR laser to determine their effectiveness as potential materials

Abstract = {{Foam is injected in the subsurface to improve mobility control through
   the increase in the effective gas viscosity, e.g., in CO-based enhanced
   oil recovery processes. As fine-textured foam has higher viscosity, it
   is envisaged to achieve an optimal foam texture and to maintain it for
   the entire period of an application. However, mechanisms of foam
   formation and destruction, which affect texture, are difficult to
   regulate. In this study, we investigate the synergic effect of
   nanoparticles and surfactant on the foam texture and the effective gas
   viscosity () during transport in a porous medium. Experiments using
   glass-bead packs were performed injecting CO and a solution containing
   either only surfactant or surfactant and nanoparticles. During each
   experiment, the pressure drop () through the porous medium was measured
   to follow the generation of the foam. A two-phase flow mechanistic model
   combining the mass conservation law for water and CO and the population
   balance equation of the lamellae was implemented to analyze the
   experiments and predict foam transport under the investigated
   conditions. The constitutive equations for foam generation and
   destruction were based on the dominant role of pressure gradient on
   lamella division and of capillary pressure on bubble coalescence, and
   their parameters were estimated using pressure drop measurements. Both
   equations were formulated for a surfactant-stabilized foam, and it was
   the aim of this work to understand their validity also for the case of a
   nanoparticle-stabilized foam. The experiments compare well with the
   theory showing that a foam stabilized with nanoparticles and surfactant
   can be modeled as a surfactant-stabilized foam. Overall, increases
   smoothly while the foam forms and, upon breakthrough, it stabilizes
   around a constant value while approaching steady state. During this
   phase, oscillations occur, particularly when high-quality foam is
   generated as the system is close to its critical conditions of capillary
   pressure and water saturation. When steady state is reached, the
   effective gas viscosity varies with and solution composition and
   significantly increases when surfactant and nanoparticles are added. The
   maximum value of is 0.110 Pa s for = 0.75, which is almost twofold of
   the maximum value attained when only a surfactant is used, corresponding
   to 0.067 Pa s at = 0.4. This suggests that when nanoparticles and
   surfactant are employed, they can favor the formation of a strong
   high-quality CO-foam.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to reduce the discrepancy between
   strut-and-tie modeling and sectional shear strength predictions at an
   a/d near 2. To accomplish this objective, the authors compiled and
   analyzed a database of 905 deep beam shear tests; 868 were gathered from
   the past literature and 37 were tested by the authors as part of a
   recent experimental investigation. Based on the results of the
   investigation and an analysis of the database, the authors identify the
   contributing causes of the discrepancy and recommend improvements to
   current shear provisions. The strut-and-tie model (STM) procedure
   proposed by the authors in a separate paper provides a uniform level of
   conservatism at the transition region between deep beam and ACI 318-11
   sectional shear provisions.}},

   The structural capacity of a series of columns with varying crack widths
   was compared to two columns specially cast and exposed to trigger ASR
   and/or DEF expansion. All columns were tested under doubly eccentric
   axial loads and failed in bearing. The ASR/DEF columns had over 1\%
   expansion when tested and had no significant reduction in bearing
   capacity. The mechanical cracking method approximated the ASR/DEF
   degradation to structural capacity in significantly less time than it
   took to trigger ASR/DEF in laboratory specimens.}},

   storage systems}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{94-107}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Energy storage in buildings is an important component of peak shifting
   and load leveling strategies devised to improve the operation of the
   electric grid. Maximizing the load-leveling benefits afforded by both
   active and passive thermal energy storage (TES) requires coordinating
   the charge/discharge events with external factors, such as weather,
   occupancy, and time-of-use pricing. The development of such controllers
   (typically following the model predictive control (MPC) paradigm) is
   challenging owing to the dimensions and multiple time scale nature of
   the problem. In this work, we propose a hierarchical control strategy,
   comprising a dynamic scheduling problem for managing active TES in the
   slow time scale, and a control scheme with a shorter horizon for
   managing passive TES in the fast time scale. The approach is
   demonstrated through an application to a TES system with phase change
   material (PCM), which presents unique modeling challenges. The proposed
   formulation and solution strategy allow for obtaining solutions in real
   time. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed approach leads to
   significant cost savings, outperforming (reasonable) operating
   heuristics even under uncertainty in forecasting building loads. (C)

Title = {{A direct-demand model for bicycle counts: the impacts of level of

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Transportation planning in the US has traditionally focused on
   automotive traffic but is increasingly turning towards a multimodal
   approach in order to accommodate all users. This shift in focus is
   particularly crucial for cyclists, as 630 were killed and 51 000 injured
   on America's roadways in 2009 alone. Unfortunately, most municipalities
   do not conduct comprehensive bicycle counts to determine where cyclists
   are riding, though some do seek a scatter of spot counts. This
   investigation uses Seattle metropolitan area cyclist-count data from 251
   locations to develop a direct-demand model for estimating peak-period
   cyclist counts based on trip-generation and attraction factors (such as
   site-based population and employment densities), as well as
   cycling-relevant roadway conditions. Roadway-condition variables were
   chosen from the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (Chapter 17, Transport
   Research Board, Washington, DC) on urban street segments (including
   factors like traffic volumes and bike-lane width), as well as other
   physical features, like bridge presence and access to bicycle trails.
   Model results show greatest practical significance for intersections
   within the City of Seattle and curb-lane width (both of which are
   associated with higher counts) and roadway speed (which is associated
   with lower counts). The model was implemented in the community of
   Shoreline, Washington, just north of Seattle, to demonstrate its
   applicability. We examined both segment-based levels of service for
   cyclists and expected intersection-based counts. Model application
   findings indicate that segment-based levels of service show little
   correlation with expected counts, though such information still serves a
   valuable purpose in terms of evaluating cyclists' comfort levels (which
   may also have potential correlation with cyclist safety), a worthwhile
   goal in itself. As such, these two models may be used in combination
   when targeting new cycling infrastructure and improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA) transpeptidase is a
   therapeutically important membrane-bound enzyme in Gram-positive
   bacteria, which organizes the covalently attached cell surface proteins
   on the peptidoglycan cell wall of the organism. Here, we report the
   direct observation of the highly selective homo-dimerization of SrtA on
   the cell membrane. To address the biological significance of the
   dimerization towards enzyme function, site-directed mutagenesis was
   performed to generate a SrtA mutant, which exists as monomer on the cell
   membrane. We observed that the cell surface display of adhesive proteins
   in S. aureus cells expressing monomeric SrtA mutant is more prominent
   than the cells expressing the wild-type enzyme. A cell-based invasion
   assay was also performed to evaluate the activities of wild-type SrtA
   and its monomeric mutant as well. Our data demonstrated that S. aureus
   cells expressing SrtA in monomeric form invade host mammalian cells more
   efficiently than those expressing wildtype SrtA in dimer-monomer
   equilibrium. The results suggested that the monomeric form of SrtA is
   more active than the dimeric form of the enzyme in terms of cell surface
   display of virulence factors for infection. This is the first study to
   present the oligomerization of SrtA and its related biological function
   on the cell membrane. Study of SrtA dimerization has implications for
   understanding its catalytic mechanism at the cellular level as well as
   the development of novel anti-infective agents.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactic acid (PLA) is an important renewable polymer, but current
   processes for producing its precursor, lactic acid, suffer from process
   inefficiencies related to the use of bacterial hosts. Therefore,
   improving the capacity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce lactic
   acid is a promising approach to improve industrial production of lactic
   acid. As one such improvement required, the lactic acid tolerance of
   yeast must be significantly increased. To enable improved tolerance, we
   employed an RNAi-mediated genome-wide expression knockdown approach as a
   means to rapidly identify potential genetic targets. In this approach,
   several gene knockdown targets were identified which confer increased
   acid tolerance to S. cerevisiae BY4741, of which knockdown of the
   ribosome-associated chaperone SSB1 conferred the highest increase (52
   \%). This target was then transferred into a lactic acid-overproducing
   strain of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK in the form of a knockout and the
   resulting strain demonstrated up to 33 \% increased cell growth, 58 \%
   increased glucose consumption, and 60 \% increased l-lactic acid
   production. As SSB1 contains a close functional homolog SSB2 in yeast,
   this result was counterintuitive and may point to as-yet-undefined
   functional differences between SSB1 and SSB2 related to lactic acid
   production. The final strain produced over 50 g/L of lactic acid in
   under 60 h of fermentation.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of silicon-doped hematite (Si:alpha-Fe2O3)
   single crystals via chemical vapor transport, with Si incorporation on
   the order of 1019 cm(-3). The conductivity, Seebeck and Hall effect were
   measured in the basal plane between 200 and 400 K. Distinct differences
   in electron transport were observed above and below the magnetic
   transition temperature of hematite at similar to 265 K (the Morin
   transition, T-M). Above 265 K, transport was found to agree with the
   adiabatic small-polaron model, the conductivity was characterized by an
   activation energy of similar to 100 meV and the Hall effect was
   dominated by the weak ferromagnetism of the material. A room temperature
   electron drift mobility of similar to 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) was
   estimated. Below TM, the activation energy increased to similar to 160
   meV and a conventional Hall coefficient could be determined. In this
   regime, the Hall coefficient was negative and the corresponding Hall
   mobility was temperature-independent with a value of similar to 10(-1)
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Seebeck coefficient measurements indicated that the
   silicon donors were fully ionized in the temperature range studied.
   Finally, we observed a broad infrared absorption upon doping and
   tentatively assign the feature at similar to 0.8 eV to photon-assisted
   small-polaron hops. These results are discussed in the context of
   existing hematite transport studies.}},

Abstract = {{Current lithography teclmiques, which employ photon, electron, or ion
   beams to induce chemical or physical reactions for
   micro/nano-fabrication, have remained challenging in patterning
   chemically synthesized colloidal particles, which are emerging as
   building blocks for functional devices. Herein, we develop a new
   technique - bubble-pen lithography (BPL) - to pattern colloidal
   particles on substrates using optically controlled microbubbles.
   Briefly, a single laser beam generates a microbubble at the interface of
   colloidal suspension and a plasmonic substrate via plasmon-enhanced
   photothermal effects. The microbubble captures and immobilizes the
   colloidal particles on the substrate through coordinated actions of
   Marangoni convection, surface tension, gas pressure, and substrate
   adhesion. Through directing the laser beam to move the microbubble, we
   create arbitrary single-particle patterns and particle assemblies with
   different resolutions and architectures. Furthermore, we have applied
   BPL to pattern CdSe/ZnS quantum dots on plasmonic substrates and
   polystyrene (PS) microparticles on two-dimensional (2D) atomic-layer
   materials. With the low-power operation, arbitrary patterning and
   applicability to general colloidal particles, BPL will find a wide range
   of applications in microelectronics, nanophotonics, and nanomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need for energy storage devices in numerous

   intercalation pseudocapacitance in ultrathin VOPO4 nanosheets, which
   hold promise in high-rate alkali-ion based electrochemical energy
   storage. Starting from bulk VOPO4. 2H(2)O chunks, VOPO4 nanosheets were
   obtained through simple ultrasonication in 2-propanol. These nanosheets
   as the cathode exhibit a specific capacity of 154 and 136 mAh/g (close
   to theoretical value 166 mAh/g) for lithium and sodium storage devices
   at 0.1 C and 100 and similar to 70 mAh/g at 5 C, demonstrating their
   high rate capability. Moreover, the capacity retention is maintained at
   90\% for lithium ion storage and 73\% for sodium ion storage after 500
   cycles, showing their reasonable stability. The demonstrated alkali-ion
   intercalation pseudocapacitance represents a promising direction for
   developing battery materials with promising high rate capability.}},

Title = {{Improved bush-based methods for network contraction}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{298-313}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Calculating equilibrium sensitivity on a bush can be done very
   efficiently, and serve as the basis for a network contraction procedure.
   The contracted network (a simplified network with a few nodes and links)
   approximates the behavior of the full network but with less complexity.
   The network contraction method can be advantageous in network design
   applications where many equilibrium problems must be solved for
   different design scenarios. The network contraction procedure can also
   be used to increase the accuracy of subnetwork analysis. This method
   requires calculating travel time derivatives between two nodes, with
   respect to the demand between them, assuming that the flow distributes
   in a way that equilibrium is maintained. Previous research describes two
   methods for calculating these derivatives. This paper presents a third
   method, which is simpler, faster, and just as accurate. The method
   presented in this paper reformulates the linear system of equations
   defining these sensitivities as the solution to a convex programming
   problem, which can be solved by making minor modifications to static
   user equilibrium algorithms. In addition, the model is extended to
   capture the interactions between the path travel times and network
   flows, and a heuristic is proposed to compute these interactions. The
   accuracy and complexity of the proposed methodology are evaluated using
   the network of Barcelona, Spain. Further, numerical experiments on the
   Austin, Texas regional network validate its performance for subnetwork
   analysis applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Use of MRF residue as alternative fuel in cement production}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{B}},
Pages = {{276-284}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Single-stream recycling has helped divert millions of metric tons of
   waste from landfills in the U.S., where recycling rates for municipal
   solid waste are currently over 30\%. However, material recovery
   facilities (MRFs) that sort the municipal recycled streams do not
   recover 100\% of the incoming material. Consequently, they landfill
   between 5\% and 15\% of total processed material as residue. This
   residue is primarily composed of high-energy-content non-recycled
   plastics and fiber. One possible end-of-life solution for these
   energy-dense materials is to process the residue into Solid Recovered
   Fuel (SRF) that can be used as an alternative energy resource capable of
   replacing or supplementing fuel resources such as coal, natural gas,
   petroleum coke, or biomass in many industrial and power production
   processes. This report addresses the energetic and environmental
   benefits and trade-offs of converting non-recycled post-consumer
   plastics and fiber derived from MRF residue streams into SRF for use in
   a cement kiln. An experimental test burn of 118 Mg of SRF in the
   precalciner portion of the cement kiln was conducted. The SRF was a
   blend of 60\% MRF residue and 40\% post-industrial waste products
   producing an estimated 60\% plastic and 40\% fibrous material mixture.
   The SRF was fed into the kiln at 0.9 Mg/h for 24 h and then 1.8 Mg/h for
   the following 48 h. The emissions data recorded in the experimental test
   burn were used to perform the life-cycle analysis portion of this study.
   The analysis included the following steps: transportation, landfill,
   processing and fuel combustion at the cement kiln. The energy use and
   emissions at each step is tracked for the two cases: (1) The Reference
   Case, where MRF residue is disposed of in a landfill and the cement kiln
   uses coal as its fuel source, and (2) The SRF Case, in which MRF residue
   is processed into SRF and used to offset some portion of coal use at the
   cement kiln. The experimental test burn and accompanying analysis
   indicate that using MRF residue to produce SRF for use in cement kilns
   is likely an advantageous alternative to disposal of the residue in
   landfills. The use of SRF can offset fossil fuel use, reduce CO2
   emissions, and divert energy-dense materials away from landfills. For
   this test-case, the use of SRF offset between 7700 and 8700 Mg of coal
   use, reduced CO2 emissions by at least 1.4\%, and diverted over 7950 Mg
   of energy-dense materials away from landfills. In addition, emissions
   were reduced by at least 19\% for SO2, while NOX emissions increased by
   between 16\% and 24\%. Changes in emissions of particulate matter,
   mercury, hydrogen chloride, and total-hydrocarbons were all less than
   plus or minus 2.2\%, however these emissions were not measured at the
   cement kiln. Co-location of MRFs, SRF production facilities, and
   landfills can increase the benefits of SRF use even further by reducing
   transportation requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A reference method for measuring emissions of SVOCs in small chambers}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{126-132}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) are indoor air pollutants that
   may have significant adverse effects on human health. Although emissions
   of volatile chemicals from building materials and consumer products are
   usually characterized in small chambers, few chamber studies have been
   conducted for SVOCs due to the challenges associated with analysis and
   the lack of validation procedures. There is an urgent need for a
   reliable and accurate chamber test method to verify these measurements.
   A reference method employing a specially-designed chamber has been
   developed and is undergoing extensive evaluation. A pilot
   inter-laboratory study (ILS) has been conducted with six laboratories
   performing chamber tests under identical conditions for di-2-ethylhexyl
   phthalate (DEHP). Results from this study showed inter-laboratory
   variations of 24\% for DEHP emission rates, with closer agreement
   observed among intra-laboratory measurements for most of the
   participating laboratories. A mechanistic emission model fits well to
   the measured concentration profiles, demonstrating the feasibility of
   the proposed reference method to independently assess laboratory
   performance and validate SVOC emission tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work examined the effects of milling using a gravity ball mill on
   the reactivity of natural zeolites used as supplementary cementitious
   materials (SCMs). Six different particle size distributions of zeolites,
   created by milling the as-received zeolite in a ball mill for a
   specified amount of time, were characterized using x-ray fluorescence,
   quantitative x-ray diffraction, particle size analysis, pore size
   distribution and surface area analysis. Following material
   characterization, the pozzolanic reactivity of the zeolites was
   determined by measuring the quantity of calcium hydroxide in paste after
   28 or 90 days and by tracking the compressive strength of zeolite-cement
   mortars. Results showed that a critical milling time exists,
   corresponding to a d50 of 7-9 gm, after which reductions in particle
   size can no longer be achieved and zeolite performance can no longer be
   improved through ball milling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to assess safety and feasibility of
   intradiscal bone marrow concentrate (BMC) injections to treat discogenic
   pain as an alternative to surgery.
   Methods A total of 26 patients (11 male, 15 female, aged 18-61 years, 13
   single level, 13 two level) that met inclusion criteria of chronic (> 6
   months) discogenic low back pain, degenerative disc pathology assessed
   by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with modified Pfirrmann grade of
   IV-VII at one or two levels, candidate for surgical intervention (failed
   conservative treatment and radiologic findings) and a visual analogue
   scale (VAS) pain score of 40 mm or more at initial visit. Initial
   Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and VAS pain score average was 56.5 \%
   and 80.1 mm (0-100), respectively. Adverse event reporting, ODI score,
   VAS pain score, MRI radiographic changes, progression to surgery and
   cellular analysis of BMC were noted. Retrospective cell analysis by flow
   cytometry and colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assays were
   performed to characterise each patient's BMC and compare with clinical
   outcomes. The BMC was injected into the nucleus pulposus of the
   symptomatic disc(s) under fluoroscopic guidance. Patients were evaluated
   clinically prior to treatment and at three, six, 12 and 24 months and
   radiographically prior to treatment and at 12 months.
   Results There were no complications from the percutaneous bone marrow
   aspiration or disc injection. Of 26 patients, 24 (92 \%) avoided surgery
   through 12 months, while 21 (81 \%) avoided surgery through two years.
   Of the 21 surviving patients, the average ODI and VAS scores were
   reduced to 19.9 and 27.0 at three months and sustained to 18.3 and 22.9
   at 24 months, respectively (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro
   parts per thousand 0.001). Twenty patients had follow-up MRI at 12
   months, of whom eight had improved by at least one Pfirrmann grade,
   while none of the discs worsened. Total and rate of pain reduction were
   linked to mesenchymal stem cell concentration through 12 months. Only
   five of the 26 patients elected to undergo surgical intervention (fusion
   or artificial disc replacement) by the two year milestone.
   Conclusions This study provides evidence of safety and feasibility in
   the non-surgical treatment of discogenic pain with autologous BMC, with
   durable pain relief (71 \% VAS reduction) and ODI improvements (> 64 \%)
   through two years.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical scheme for solving a parameter estimation problem

   anisotropic tumor diffusion. We use a constrained optimization
   formulation with a reaction-diffusion model that results in a system of
   nonlinear partial differential equations. In our formulation, we
   estimate the parameters using partially observed, noisy tumor
   concentration data at two different time instances, along with white
   matter fiber directions derived from diffusion tensor imaging. The
   optimization problem is solved with a Gauss-Newton reduced space
   algorithm. We present the formulation and outline the numerical
   algorithms for solving the resulting equations. We test the method using
   a synthetic dataset and compute the reconstruction error for different
   noise levels and detection thresholds for monofocal and multifocal test

Abstract = {{Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 Env V1V2 arise in
   multiple donors. However, atomic-level interactions had previously been
   determined only with antibodies from a single donor, thus making
   commonalities in recognition uncertain. Here we report the cocrystal
   structure of V1V2 with antibody CH03 from a second donor and model Env
   interactions of antibody CAP256-VRC26 from a third donor. These V1
   V2-directed bNAbs used strand-strand interactions between a protruding
   antibody loop and a V1V2 strand but differed in their N-glycan
   recognition. Ontogeny analysis indicated that protruding loops develop
   early, and glycan interactions mature over time. Altogether, the
   multidonor information suggested that V1V2-directed bNAbs form an
   `extended class', for which we engineered ontogeny-specific antigens:
   Env trimers with chimeric V1V2s that interacted with inferred ancestor
   and intermediate antibodies. The ontogeny-based design of vaccine
   antigens described here may provide a general means for eliciting
   antibodies of a desired class.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the use of add treatment as a method for
   increasing the reactivity of natural zeolite used as a supplementary
   cementitious material. The effects of treating a natural clinoptilolite
   zeolite with nine acid solutions, 0.1 M, 0.5 M, or 1 M hydrochloric or
   nitric acid or 0.1 M, 0.5 M, or 0.87 M acetic acid, were measured using
   x-ray diffraction, particle size analysis, pore size distribution and
   surface area analysis. The zeolite pozzolanic reactivity was determined
   by measuring the quantity of portlandite in hydrated zeolite-cement
   paste after 28 and 90 days. Results showed that acid treatment increased
   zeolite surface area, resulting in increased zeolite pozzolanic
   reactivity, independent of the solution concentration used. Cement
   hydration was also increased, evidenced by greater rates of heat
   evolution from cement-zeolite pastes. Additionally, although reductions
   of portlandite occurred most quickly in pastes with zeolites treated
   with strong acids, by 90 days the zeolites treated with acetic acid
   solutions showed comparable portlandite reductions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND It is unclear whether isolation of the Left atrial. posterior
   wall (LAPW) offers additional. benefits over pulmonary vein antrum
   isolation (PVAI) alone in patients with persistent atrial. fibrillation
   (AF).
   OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the impact of PVAI and LAPW isolation
   (PVAI+LAPW) versus PVAI alone on the outcome of ablation of persistent
   AF.
   METHODS During the first procedure, PVAI was performed in 20 patients
   (group 1), whereas in 32 patients (group 2), PVAI was extended to the
   Left atrial. (LA) septum and coronary sinus (CS), and isolation of the
   LAPW was targeted (ePVAI+LAPW). Isolation of the superior vena cava was
   achieved in both groups. ALL patients, regardless of arrhythmia
   recurrence, underwent a second procedure 3 months after the first
   procedure. In patients with reconnection of pulmonary veins or LAPW,
   reisolation was performed, and a third procedure was performed 3 months
   Later to verify isolation. Patients entered follow-up only after PVAI
   (group 1) or PVAI+LAPW (group 2) isolation was proven.
   RESULTS At the 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up examinations, the rates of
   freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia without use of an antiarrhythmic
   drug were 20\%, 15\%, and 10\% in group 1 and 65\%, 50\%, and 40\% in
   group 2, respectively (Log-rank P < .001). The median recurrence-free
   survival. time was 8.5 months (interquartile range 6.5-11.0) in group 1
   and 28.0 months (interquartile range 8.5-32.0) in group 2.
   CONCLUSION Proven isolation of the LAPW provides additional. benefits
   over PVAI alone in the treatment of persistent AF and improves
   procedural. outcome at follow-up. However, the ablation strategy of
   ePVAI+LAPW is still associated with a significant high incidence of very
   Late recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Whether ablation of non pulmonary vein (PV) triggers after
   pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) improves the long-term procedure
   outcome in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate whether a more extensive ablation
   procedure improves outcomes at follow-up.
   METHODS Consecutive patients with PAF refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs
   presenting for PVAI were prospectively studied. Patients were
   categorized into 2 groups: patients with left ventricular ejection
   fraction (LVEF) <= 35\% (group I; n = 175) and patients with LVEF >=
   50\% (group II; n = 545). Patients in group I were further divided
   according to whether additional ablation of non-PV triggers was
   performed (group IA; n = 88) or not (group IB; n = 87). Long-term
   ablation success off antiarrhythmic drugs after a single procedure was
   analyzed.
   RESULTS Patients in group I had more non-PV triggers than did patients
   in group II (69.1\% vs 26.6\%; P < .001). During a follow-up of 15.8 +/-
   4.7 months, fewer patients in group I remained free from recurrences
   than those in group II (53.7\% vs 81.7\%; P < .001). Long-term ablation
   success was higher in group IA than in group IB (75.0\% vs 32.2\%; P <
   .001) and similar to that in group II (75.0\% vs 81.7\%; P = .44). In
   multivariate analysis, LVEF <= 35\% (hazard ratio 1.68; P = .003) and
   non-PV triggers (hazard ratio 3.12; P < .001) were independent
   predictors of recurrences.
   CONCLUSION In patients with PAF and left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction, ablation of non-PV triggers in addition to PVAI
   significantly improves their long-term procedure outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium phosphate-based cements with enhanced regenerative potential are
   promising biomaterials for the healing of bone defects in procedures
   such as percutaneous vertebroplasty. With a view to the use of such

   filling extraction sites. However, the inclusion of certain species into
   bone cement formulations has the potential to diminish the mechanical
   properties of the formulations and thereby reduce their prospects for
   clinical translation. Consequently, we have prepared -tricalcium
   phosphate (-TCP)-based bone cements including materials that we would
   expect to improve their regenerative potential, and describe the
   mechanical properties of the resulting formulations herein. Formulations
   incorporated -TCP, hydroxyapatite, biopolymer-thickened wetting agents,
   sutures, and platelet poor plasma. The mechanical properties of the
   composites were composition dependent, and optimized formulations had
   clinically relevant mechanical properties. Such calcium phosphate-based
   cements have potential as replacements for cements such as those based
   on polymethylmethacrylate. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{In situ electrochemical generation of 2-dimensional Co3O4 (2D-Co3O4)

   instead of retaining its original morphology, the irregular-shaped
   nanoparticles undergo a morphological transition into hexagonal
   nanoplates during the oxidation process. The mechanism of the
   morphological changes is discussed and a two-step topotactic
   transformation pathway from Co(OH)(2) to CoOOH to Co3O4 is proposed.
   Amorphization and recrystallization of the catalysts are also found at

Volume = {{163}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of lithium-ion battery cells are usually performed with
   volume averaging methods that employ effective transport properties.
   Bruggeman's model, which is widely used to determine these effective
   properties, is primarily based on the volume fraction of porous
   electrodes. It does not consider actual particle shape, size or the
   topology of constituent phases; these play a crucial role in determining
   effective transport. In this paper, a general derivation of the
   effective thermal conductivity of multiphase materials, which can be
   correlated with these factors, is derived using the volume averaging
   technique. Three-dimensional finite volume meshes of fully-resolved
   lithium-ion battery cathode microstructures are reconstructed from
   scanned images. Effective volume averaged thermal conductivity is then
   determined from numerical analysis of thermal transport on these meshes.
   It is shown that the Bruggeman model for effective thermal conductivity
   must be recalibrated to fit the effective thermal conductivity computed
   from these detailed simulations. The relevance of these results to
   effective transport properties typically employed in electrochemical
   simulations is presented. Commonly used theories for effective thermal
   transport in composites are evaluated for comparison. Furthermore, it is
   shown that Bruggeman's exponents yield an important quantitative
   measure, the connectivity, to characterize the physical path for
   transport through the underlying phases. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The image gradient is a commonly computed image feature and a
   potentially predictive factor for image quality assessment (IQA).
   Indeed, it has been successfully used for both full- and no- reference
   image quality prediction. However, the gradient orientation has not been
   deeply explored as a predictive source of information for image quality
   assessment. Here we seek to amend this by studying the quality relevance
   of the relative gradient orientation, viz., the gradient orientation
   relative to the surround. We also deploy a relative gradient magnitude
   feature which accounts for perceptual masking and utilize an AdaBoosting
   back-propagation (BP) neural network to map the image features to image
   quality. The generalization of the AdaBoosting BP neural network results
   in an effective and robust quality prediction model. The new model,
   called Oriented Gradients Image Quality Assessment (OG-IQA), is shown to
   deliver highly competitive image quality prediction performance as
   compared with the most popular IQA approaches. Furthermore, we show that
   OG-IQA has good database independence properties and a low complexity.

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this research effort is to identify the effectiveness of
   a particular set of important management programs in improving
   construction labor productivity. These programs were previously defined
   through industry experts and research consensus as having significant
   impact on project cost, schedule, safety, scope, and quality
   performance, but their relationship to labor productivity was not known.
   Through statistical analyses of the database maintained by the
   Construction Industry Institute's Benchmarking and Metrics Committee,
   headquartered in Austin, Texas, United States, the research presented in
   this article examined whether projects with high levels of
   implementation of programs related to front-end planning, materials
   management, automation and integration of information systems, team
   building, constructability, and safety, experienced better labor
   productivity among the mechanical, electrical, concrete, and structural
   steel trades compared to projects with low levels of implementation. The
   result showed that the majority of the investigated management programs
   were statistically significantly correlated to better construction labor
   productivity, and the significance was different among various craft
   trades. The paper's major contribution to the overall body of knowledge
   is that it comprehensively quantifies the potential relationship of
   implementing project management programs to labor productivity on large
   industrial projects. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the combined effect of injecting low salinity
   water (LSWI) and carbon dioxide (CO2) on oil recovery from carbonate
   cores. The combined effect of LSWI and CO2 injection on oil recovery was
   predicted by performing several 1D simulations using measured reservoir
   rock and fluid data. These simulations included the effect of salinity
   on both miscible and immiscible continuous gas injection (CGI),
   simultaneous water-alternating-gas (SWAG), constant
   water-alternating-gas (WAG), and tapered (WAG). For SWAG and constant
   and tapered WAG, both seawater and its dilutions were simulated. CO2 was
   injected above its minimum miscibility pressure. Baker's three-phase
   relative permeability model was modified to account for the effect of
   salinity on the water/oil relative permeability.
   The results show that SWAG, whether using seawater or its dilutions,
   outperformed all other tertiary injection modes in terms of oil
   recovery. Moreover, the SWAG process has both the highest tertiary
   recovery factor (TRF) and the lowest utilization factor (UF). This study
   highlights the advantage of using low salinity water along with miscible
   CO2. The miscible CO2 displaces the residual oil saturation whereas the
   low salinity water boosts the production rate by increasing the oil
   relative permeability through wettability alteration towards more a
   water-wet state. The latter finding was supported by comparing our
   simulations with the two corefloods reported by Chandrasekhar and
   Moharny (2014). These corefloods were conducted in SWAG tertiary mode
   using seawater and its dilutions. Fractional flow analysis shows that
   SWAG with low salinity water requires less injected solvent compared to
   SWAG with seawater and miscible CGI. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A high-throughput mechanofluidic screening platform for investigating
   tumor cell adhesion during metastasis}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{142-152}},
Abstract = {{The metastatic spread of cancer is a major barrier to effective and
   curative therapies for cancer. During metastasis, tumor cells
   intravasate into the vascular system, survive in the shear forces and
   immunological environment of the circulation, and then extravasate into
   secondary tumor sites. Biophysical forces are potent regulators of
   cancer biology and are key in many of the steps of metastasis. In
   particular, the adhesion of circulating cells is highly dependent upon
   competing forces between cell adhesion receptors and the shear stresses
   due to fluid flow. Conventional in vitro assays for drug development and
   the mechanistic study of metastasis are often carried out in the absence
   of fluidic forces and, consequently, are poorly representative of the
   true biology of metastasis. Here, we present a novel high-throughput
   approach to studying cell adhesion under flow that uses a multi-well,
   mechanofluidic flow system to interrogate adhesion of cancer cell to
   endothelial cells, extracellular matrix and platelets under
   physiological shear stresses. We use this system to identify pathways
   and compounds that can potentially be used to inhibit cancer adhesion
   under flow by screening anti-inflammatory compounds, integrin inhibitors
   and a kinase inhibitor library. In particular, we identify several small
   molecule inhibitors of FLT-3 and AKT that are potent inhibitors of
   cancer cell adhesion to endothelial cells and platelets under flow. In
   addition, we found that many kinase inhibitors lead to increased
   adhesion of cancer cells in flow-based but not static assays. This
   finding suggests that even compounds that reduce cell proliferation
   might also enhance cancer cell adhesion during metastasis. Overall, our
   results validate a novel platform for investigating the mechanisms of
   cell adhesion under biophysical flow conditions and identify several
   potential inhibitors of cancer cell adhesion during metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{During the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of graphene on Cu
   foils, evaporation of Cu and changes in the dimensions of Cu grains in
   directions both parallel and perpendicular to the foils are induced by
   thermal effects. Such changes in the Cu foil could subsequently change
   the shape and distribution of individual graphene domains grown on the
   foil surface, and thus influence the domain structure and electrical
   properties of the resulting graphene films. Here, a slower cooling rate
   is used after the CVD process, and the graphene films are found to have
   an improved electrical performance, which is considered to be associated
   with the Cu surface evaporation and grain structure changes in the Cu

Title = {{A Completely Blind Video Integrity Oracle}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{289-300}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Considerable progress has been made toward developing still picture
   perceptual quality analyzers that do not require any reference picture
   and that are not trained on human opinion scores of distorted images.
   However, there do not yet exist any such completely blind video quality
   assessment (VQA) models. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by
   developing a new VQA model called the video intrinsic integrity and
   distortion evaluation oracle (VIIDEO). The new model does not require
   the use of any additional information other than the video being quality
   evaluated. VIIDEO embodies models of intrinsic statistical regularities
   that are observed in natural vidoes, which are used to quantify
   disturbances introduced due to distortions. An algorithm derived from
   the VIIDEO model is thereby able to predict the quality of distorted
   videos without any external knowledge about the pristine source,
   anticipated distortions, or human judgments of video quality. Even with
   such a paucity of information, we are able to show that the VIIDEO
   algorithm performs much better than the legacy full reference quality
   measure MSE on the LIVE VQA database and delivers performance comparable
   with a leading human judgment trained blind VQA model. We believe that
   the VIIDEO algorithm is a significant step toward making real-time
   monitoring of completely blind video quality possible. The software
   release of VIIDEO can be obtained online
   (http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/VIIDEO\_release.zip).}},

Abstract = {{Most publicly available image quality databases have been created under
   highly controlled conditions by introducing graded simulated distortions
   onto high-quality photographs. However, images captured using typical
   real-world mobile camera devices are usually afflicted by complex
   mixtures of multiple distortions, which are not necessarily well-modeled
   by the synthetic distortions found in existing databases. The
   originators of existing legacy databases usually conducted human
   psychometric studies to obtain statistically meaningful sets of human
   opinion scores on images in a stringently controlled visual environment,
   resulting in small data collections relative to other kinds of image
   analysis databases. Toward overcoming these limitations, we designed and
   created a new database that we call the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality
   Challenge Database, which contains widely diverse authentic image
   distortions on a large number of images captured using a representative
   variety of modern mobile devices. We also designed and implemented a new
   online crowdsourcing system, which we have used to conduct a very
   large-scale, multi-month image quality assessment (IQA) subjective
   study. Our database consists of over 350 000 opinion scores on 1162
   images evaluated by over 8100 unique human observers. Despite the lack
   of control over the experimental environments of the numerous study
   participants, we demonstrate excellent internal consistency of the
   subjective data set. We also evaluate several top-performing blind IQA
   algorithms on it and present insights on how the mixtures of distortions
   challenge both end users as well as automatic perceptual quality
   prediction models. The new database is available for public use at
   http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/ChallengeDB/index.html.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first full-scale experimental investigation of
   the self-centering steel plate shear wall (SC-SPSW) system. The SC-SPSW
   system is a lateral force-resisting system developed to provide system
   recentering and limit structural damage to easily replaceable energy
   dissipating fuses (i.e., thin steel web plates). Recentering is provided
   by posttensioned (PT) beam-to-column connections. This test program is
   composed of two two-story SC-SPSW specimens, each with a different PT
   beam-to-column connection. For one specimen, connections rock about both
   beam flanges; for the other, connections rock about the top beam flange
   only. Both specimens incorporated a posttensioned column base detail to
   further promote recentering and damage mitigation. The specimens were
   tested pseudodynamically using excitations representing three different
   seismic hazard levels. Results show that the SC-SPSW system is capable
   of meeting and exceeding the specified performance objectives. (C) 2015

Title = {{Meta-analysis of real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies using individual

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies using real-time fMRI neurofeedback have
   demonstrated that successful regulation of neural activity is possible
   in various brain regions. Since these studies focused on the regulated
   region(s), little is known about the target-independent mechanisms
   associated with neurofeedback-guided control of brain activation, i.e.
   the regulating network. While the specificity of the activation during
   self-regulation is an important factor, no study has effectively
   determined the network involved in self-regulation in general. In an
   effort to detect regions that are responsible for the act of brain
   regulation, we performed a post-hoc analysis of data involving different
   target regions based on studies from different research groups. We
   included twelve suitable studies that examined nine different target
   regions amounting to a total of 175 subjects and 899 neurofeedback runs.
   Data analysis included a standard first-(single subject, extracting main
   paradigm) and second-level (single subject, all runs) general linear
   model (GLM) analysis of all participants taking into account the
   individual timing. Subsequently, at the third level, a random effects
   model GLM included all subjects of all studies, resulting in an overall
   mixed effects model. Since four of the twelve studies had a reduced
   field of view (FoV), we repeated the same analysis in a subsample of
   eight studies that had a well-overlapping FoV to obtain a more global
   picture of self-regulation.
   The GLM analysis revealed that the anterior insula as well as the basal
   ganglia, notably the striatum, were consistently active during the
   regulation of brain activation across the studies. The anterior insula
   has been implicated in interoceptive awareness of the body and cognitive
   control. Basal ganglia are involved in procedural learning, visuomotor
   integration and other higher cognitive processes including motivation.
   The larger FoV analysis yielded additional activations in the anterior
   cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,
   the temporo-parietal area and the visual association areas including the
   temporo-occipital junction. In conclusion, we demonstrate that several
   key regions, such as the anterior insula and the basal ganglia, are
   consistently activated during self-regulation in real-time fMRI
   neurofeedback independent of the targeted region-ofinterest. Our results
   imply that if the real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies target regions of
   this regulation network, such as the anterior insula, care should be
   given whether activation changes are related to successful regulation,
   or related to the regulation process per se. Furthermore, future
   research is needed to determine how activation within this regulation
   network is related to neurofeedback success. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The output from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel
   flow at Re approximate to 1000 is used to construct a publicly and Web
   services accessible, spatio-temporal database for this flow. The
   simulated channel has a size of 8h x 2h x 3h, where h is the channel
   half-height. Data are stored at 2048 x 512 x 1536 spatial grid points
   for a total of 4000 time samples every 5 time steps of the DNS. These
   cover an entire channel flow-through time, i.e. the time it takes to
   traverse the entire channel length 8h at the mean velocity of the bulk
   flow. Users can access the database through an interface that is based
   on the Web services model and perform numerical experiments on the
   slightly over 100 terabytes (TB) DNS data on their remote platforms,
   such as laptops or local desktops. Additional technical details about
   the pressure calculation, database interpolation, and differentiation
   tools are provided in several appendices. As a sample application of the
   channel flow database, we use it to conduct an a-priori test of a
   recently introduced integral wall model for large eddy simulation of
   wall-bounded turbulent flow. The results are compared with those of the
   equilibrium wall model, showing the strengths of the integral wall model
   as compared to the equilibrium model.}},

Abstract = {{Amine scrubbing is the most mature CO2 capture technology for coal-fired
   power plants. However, the energy consumption for regeneration incurs a
   20-25\% penalty on electricity output. This loss can be reduced by
   alternative stripper design. This work uses exergy analysis to quantify
   the inefficiencies and demonstrate the effectiveness of a new
   configuration, the advanced flash stripper, without having to consider
   numerous alternatives. The lost work from the overhead condenser and the
   cross exchanger makes the simple stripper inefficient. The advanced
   flash stripper successfully eliminates the lost work of the condenser
   and improves the reversibility of the cross exchanger. It reduces the
   reboiler duty by 16\% and the overall work requirement by 11\% compared
   to the simple stripper. The new design when used with piperazine showed
   a remarkable 74\% thermodynamic efficiency. Further improvement of
   energy efficiency is expected to be marginal. This work not only
   provides a better design that reduces the energy consumption, but also
   indicates that the state-of-the-art is approaching the theoretical work

Title = {{The effects of pore geometry on adsorption equilibrium in shale

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{205-213}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Textural characterization is a critical step to assess and evaluate
   petrophysical properties of unconventional reservoirs, including
   shale-gas, coalbed and tight-gas systems. Gas adsorption, typically with
   N2 at 77 K or CO2 at 273 K, is the widely used method for such
   characterizations. To translate adsorption data into useful
   petrophysical quantities such as pore size, pore connectivity, and pore
   volume, one needs to exploit appropriate correlations to link molecular
   scale interactions and macro-scale phenomena. One important yet
   under-studied property of unconventional matrices is their true pore
   structure and its effects on fluid thermodynamics inside pore space.
   Herein, based on lattice density functional theory, we have developed a
   multilayer adsorption model with parameterized energy terms, to
   determine effects of pore shape and pore size (of shale and coal
   samples) on the thermodynamic state of reservoir fluid. The model is
   extended from its original slit pore geometry into cylindrical and
   spherical geometries to consider the effects of local pore curvature on
   adsorption energetics and uptakes mainly in mesopores (between 2 and 50
   nm). In addition, the surface energy term is modified to consider the
   effect of the force field exerted by pore walls on both the adlayer and
   subsequent adsorbed layers. Modification of the energy term resulted in
   layer-by-layer, two-dimensional condensation followed by the final
   capillary condensation. The force field exerted by the pore walls
   together with local pore curvature shifted the condensation pressures
   toward lower relative pressures (P/P0). By applying the model to N-2
   porosimetry isotherms at 77 K for two reference samples, ordered
   mesoporous silica (SBA-15) and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), the
   model confirmed essentially cylindrical pore structure for both samples.
   The model was further applied to N-2 at 77K porosimetry isotherms of
   Woodford shale and Cameo coal samples, and identified the pore
   structures of the samples as dominated by cylindrical and slit pore
   geometries, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To date, relatively few examples of ultra-high internal phase
   supercritical CO2-in-water foams (also referred to as macroemulsions)
   have been observed, despite interest in applications including
   ``waterless{''} hydraulic fracturing in energy production. The
   viscosities and stabilities of foams up to 0.98 CO2 volume fraction were
   investigated in terms of foam bubble size, interfacial tension, and bulk
   and surface viscosity. The foams were stabilized with laurylamidopropyl
   betaine (LAPB) surfactant and silica nanoparticles (NPs), with and
   without partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). For foams stabilized
   with mixture of LAPS and NPs, fine similar to 70 mu m bubbles and high
   viscosities on the order of 100 cP at >0.90 internal phase fraction were
   stabilized for hours to days. The surfactant reduces interfacial
   tension, and thus facilitates bubble generation and decreases the
   capillary pressure to reduce the drainage rate of the lamella. The LAPB,
   which is in the cationic protonated form, also attracts anionic NPs (and
   anionic HPAM in systems containing polymer) to the interface. The
   adsorbed NPs at the interface are shown to slow down Ostwald ripening
   (with or without polymer added) and increase foam stability. In systems
   with added HPAM, the increase in the bulk and surface viscosity of the
   aqueous phase further decreases the lamella drainage rate and inhibits
   coalescence of foams. Thus, the added polymer increases the foam
   viscosity by threefold. Scaling law analysis shows the viscosity of 0.90
   volume fraction foams is inversely proportional to the bubble size. (C)

Title = {{Mechanism of Efficient Proton Conduction in Diphosphoric Acid Elucidated

Abstract = {{Diphosphoric acid (H4P2O7) is the first condensation product of
   phosphoric acid (H3PO4), the compound with the highest intrinsic proton
   conductivity in the liquid state. It exists at higher temperature (T >
   200 degrees C) and lower relative humidity (RH approximate to 0.01\%)
   and shows significant ionic conductivity under these conditions. In this
   work, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of a pure H4P2O7 model
   system and NMR spectroscopy on nominal H4P2O7 (which contains
   significant amounts of ortho- and triphosphoric acid in thermodynamic
   equilibrium) were performed to reveal the nature and underlying
   mechanisms of the ionic conductivity. The central oxygen of the molecule
   is found to be excluded from any hydrogen bonding, which has two
   interesting consequences: (i) compared to H3PO4, the acidity of H4P2O7
   is severely increased, and (ii) the condensation reaction only leads to
   a minor decrease in hydrogen bond network frustration, which is thought
   to be one of the features enabling high proton conductivity. A
   topological analysis of diphosphoric acid's hydrogen bond network shows
   remarkable similarities to that of phosphonic acid (H3PO3). The hydrogen
   bonding facilitates protonic polarization fluctuations (Zundel
   polarization) extending over several molecules (Grotthuss chains), the
   other important ingredient for efficient structural diffusion of
   protons. At T = 160 degrees C, this is estimated to make a conductivity
   contribution of about 0.1 S/cm, which accounts for half of the total
   ionic conductivity (sigma approximate to 0.2 S/cm). The other half is
   suggested to result from diffusion of charged phosphate species (vehicle
   mechanism) that are present in high concentration, resembling conduction
   in ionic liquids.}},

Abstract = {{We provide the first experimental demonstration of the transmission
   characteristics of holey and slotted photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs)
   in silicon-on-sapphire at mid-infrared wavelength of 3.43 mu m. Devices
   are studied as a function of lattice constant to tune the photonic stop
   band across the single wavelength of the source laser. In the holey PCW,
   propagation losses less than 20 dB/cm are observed below the light line
   while more than 400 dB/cm propagation losses are observed above the
   light line, characteristic of the waveguiding behavior of photonic
   crystal line defect modes. Comparison between the holey and slotted PCWs
   with PCWs without low-index inclusions shows the higher sensitivity to
   refractive index changes in chemical sensing for the holey and slotted
   PCWs compared to the regular PCWs. Triethylphosphate (TEP), a chemical
   warfare simulant, was detected down to a concentration of 10 ppm (parts
   per million) with a 800 mu m long holey PCW in gas phase via optical
   absorbance signature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Muscle Function after Injury}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle regeneration following acute injury is a multi-step
   process involving complex changes in tissue microenvironment.
   Macrophages (MPs) are one of the key cell types involved in
   orchestration and modulation of the repair process. Multiple studies
   highlight the essential role of MPs in the control of the myogenic
   program and inflammatory response during skeletal muscle regeneration. A
   variety of MP phenotypes have been identified and characterized in vitro
   as well as in vivo. As such, MPs hold great promise for cell-based
   therapies in the field of regenerative medicine. In this study we used
   bone-marrow derived in vitro LPS/IFN-y-induced M1 MPs to enhance
   functional muscle recovery after tourniquet-induced ischemia/reperfusion
   injury (TK-I/R). We detected a 15\% improvement in specific tension and
   force normalized to mass after M1 (LPS/IFN-gamma) MP transplantation 24
   hours post-reperfusion. Interestingly, we found that M0 bone
   marrow-derived unpolarized MPs significantly impaired muscle function
   highlighting the complexity of temporally coordinated skeletal muscle
   regenerative program. Furthermore, we show that delivery of M1
   (LPS/IFN-gamma) MPs early in regeneration accelerates myofiber repair,
   decreases fibrotic tissue deposition and increases whole muscle IGF-I
   expression.}},

Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Metallic mercury (Hg-0) and its compounds are highly mobile and toxic
   environmental pollutants at trace level. In situ thermal desorption
   (ISTD) is one of the soil remediation processes applying heat and vacuum
   simultaneously. Knowledge of thermodynamic mercury speciation is
   imperative to understand the fate and transport of mercury during
   thermal remediation and operate the treatment processes in a
   cost-effective manner. Hence, speciation model for inorganic mercury was
   developed over a range of environmental conditions to identify
   distribution of dissolved mercury species and potential transformations
   of mercury at near source environment. Simulation of phase transitions
   for metallic mercury, mercury(II) chloride and mercury sulfide with
   temperature increase showed that complete vaporization of metallic
   mercury and mercury(II) chloride were achieved below the boiling point
   of water. The effect of soil compositions on mercury removal was also
   evaluated to better understand thermal remediation process. Higher vapor
   pressures expected both from soil pore water and inorganic carbonate
   minerals in soil as well as creation of permeability were significant
   for complete vaporization and removal of mercury. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This research evaluated the use of a milling machine to texture pavement
   surfaces and its effect on skid improvement. Texturing tests with
   different milling drums, forward speeds and cutting depths were
   conducted on 31 asphalt pavement sections across Texas. Macrotexture and
   friction were measured before the milling and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months
   after the milling. The results show that sections milled with fine drums
   exhibited a higher skid resistance and macrotexture after milling. The
   test results also indicate that the forward milling speed is positively
   associated with both skid resistance and macrotexture. In other words,
   higher milling speeds tend to produce surfaces with higher skid
   resistance and macrotexture. The data suggests that milling operations
   on average provide a service life of about 12 months on seal coats,
   whereas milling on HMA sections extends the service life beyond 18
   months. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted world-wide attention
   due to their low cost, high conversion efficiency, and environmental
   friendliness. Pt catalyst is usually used as the catalyst in the counter
   electrode of DSSCs due to its high electrochemical catalytic activity
   toward tri-iodide reduction. However, the high cost and scarcity of Pt
   prevent its large-scale application in DSSCs. It is highly desirable to
   replace Pt with low-cost catalysts made from earth-abundant elements.
   Here, we report a dual-template synthesis of N-doped macro/mesoporous
   carbon (macro/mesa-NC) with an open-pore structure as the catalyst in
   the counter electrode of DSSCs. The catalytic activity of macro/meso-NC
   toward triiodide reduction has been tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV)
   and photocurrent-voltage (J-V) curves. It is found that the
   macro/meso-NC possesses excellent electrochemical catalytic activity
   with higher open-circuit voltage and cell efficiency than Pt. A high
   energy conversion efficiency of 7.27\% has been achieved based on the
   metal-free macro/mesa-NC, demonstrating as a promising catalyst for
   low-cost DSSCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The flow of multiple fluid phases in porous media often results in
   trapped droplets of the nonwetting phase. Recent experimental and
   theoretical studies have suggested that nanoparticle aqueous dispersions
   may be effective at mobilizing trapped droplets of nonwetting fluid
   (oil) in porous media. Hypotheses to explain the observation include the
   nanoparticles' modification of solid wettability, droplet stabilization,
   and changes in interfacial tension and interface rheology. However,
   because it is difficult to observe droplet behavior on the pore scale,
   how those factors contribute to oil droplet mobilization has not been
   fully understood. In this work, we investigated the nanoparticles' role
   in nanoparticle-based improved recovery of the nonwetting phase through
   the direct observation of the mobilization of trapped oil droplets in
   microfluidic structures that mimic pore throat geometries. A
   microfluidic platform was constructed for this study, on which different
   displacing liquids including aqueous surfactant solutions and
   nanoparticle suspensions were tested. We found that the nanoparticle
   concentration is positively related to the oil mobilization efficiency.
   An approximate mathematical model for calculating the maximum size of an
   oil droplet trapped in a pore throat geometry for a fixed flow rate
   matches the experiment result for displacing liquid with no
   nanoparticles. The model still holds when the nanoparticle suspension is
   a displacing liquid. We concluded that nanoparticles mobilize oil in
   these geometries in a mechanism similar to that for surfactants, which
   is an increase in capillary number rather than an effect of other
   fluidic or interfacial properties such as the dynamics adsorption of
   nanoparticle or dilational rheology of a nanoparticle-adsorbed
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Catheter ablation reduces ventricular tachycardia (VT)
   recurrence and implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks in patients
   with VT and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The most effective catheter
   ablation technique is unknown.
   OBJECTIVES This study determined rates of VT recurrence in patients
   undergoing ablation limited to clinical VT along with mappable
   VTs({''}clinical ablation{''}) versus substrate-based ablation.
   METHODS Subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy and hemodynamically
   tolerated VT were randomized to clinical ablation (n = 60) versus
   substrate-based ablation that targeted all ``abnormal{''} electrograms
   in the scar (n = 58). Primary endpoint was recurrence of VT. Secondary
   endpoints included periprocedural complications, 12-month mortality, and
   rehospitalizations.
   RESULTS At 12-month follow-up, 9 (15.5\%) and 29 (48.3\%) patients had
   VT recurrence in substrate-based and clinical VT ablation groups,
   respectively (log-rank p < 0.001). More patients undergoing clinical VT
   ablation (58\%) were on antiarrhythmic drugs after ablation versus
   substrate-based ablation (12\%; p < 0.001). Seven (12\%) patients with
   substrate ablation and 19 (32\%) with clinical ablation required
   rehospitalization (p = 0.014). Overall 12-month mortality was 11.9\%;
   8.6\% in substrate ablation and 15.0\% in clinical ablation groups,
   respectively (log-rank p = 0.21). Combined incidence of
   rehospitalization and mortality was significantly lower with substrate
   ablation (p = 0.003). Periprocedural complications were similar in both
   groups (p = 0.61).
   CONCLUSIONS An extensive substrate-based ablation approach is superior
   to ablation targeting only clinical and stable VTs in patients with
   ischemic cardiomyopathy presenting with tolerated VT. (Ablation of

Title = {{Ridge-based bias potentials to accelerate molecular dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{An effective way to accelerate rare events in molecular dynamics
   simulations is to apply a bias potential which destabilizes minima
   without biasing the transitions between stable states. This approach,
   called hyperdynamics, is limited by our ability to construct general
   bias potentials without having to understand the reaction mechanisms
   available to the system, a priori. Current bias potentials are typically
   constructed in terms of a metric which quantifies the distance that a
   trajectory deviates from the reactant state minimum. Such metrics
   include detection of negative curvatures of the potential, an energy
   increase, or deviations in bond lengths from the minimum. When one of
   these properties exceeds a critical value, the bias potentials are
   constructed to approach zero. A problem common to each of these schemes
   is that their effectiveness decreases rapidly with system size. We
   attribute this problem to a diminishing volume defined by the metrics
   around a reactant minimum as compared to the total volume of the
   reactant state basin. In this work, we mitigate the dimensionality
   scaling problem by constructing bias potentials that are based upon the
   distance to the boundary of the reactant basin. This distance is
   quantified in two ways: (i) by following the minimum mode direction to
   the reactant boundary and (ii) by training a machine learning algorithm
   to give an analytic expression for the boundary to which the distance
   can be calculated. Both of these ridge-based bias potentials are
   demonstrated to scale qualitatively better with dimensionality than the
   existing methods. We attribute this improvement to a greater filling
   fraction of the reactant state using the ridge-based bias potentials as
   compared to the standard potentials. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Electron emission from the electrode surface plays an important role in
   determining the structure of a direct-current microdischarge. Here we
   have developed a computational model of a direct-current microdischarge
   to study the effect of external electron injection from the cathode
   surface into the discharge to manipulate its properties. The model
   provides a self-consistent, multi-species, multi-temperature fluid
   representation of the plasma. A microdischarge with a
   metal-insulator-metal configuration is chosen for this study. The effect
   of external electron injection on the structure and properties of the
   microdischarge is described. The transient behavior of the
   microdischarge during the electron injection is examined. The
   nonlinearities in the dynamics of the plasma result in a large increase
   of conduction current after active electron injection. For the
   conditions simulated a switching time of similar to 100 ns from a
   low-current to high-current discharge state is realized. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide has been identified as a prospective anode material for
   use in lithium ion batteries. The higher lithiation potential of TiO2
   versus other common anodes is more electrochemically compatible with
   most organic electrolytes, thus leading to reduced solid electrolyte
   interphase formation and overall more stable battery systems. However,
   in this study TiO2 has exhibited poor cycling stability with common
   electrolytes containing lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) salt.
   Combined electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses have revealed this
   to be due to the onset of reversible fluorination of the anode and
   chemical conversion of TiO2 to TiOF2 during lithiation. Comparison of
   electrochemical cycling of atomic-layer-deposited TiO2 anodes using
   LiPF6 with and without a hydrofluoric acid scavenger, tributylamine, to
   cycling using a non-fluorinated lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) salt
   indicates that the in situ formation of hydrofluoric acid in the
   electrolyte from decomposition of the PF6- anion alters the lithiation
   electrochemistry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and
   time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF SIMS) depth
   profiling measurements confirmed the presence of TiF2 and TiOF surface
   and bulk phases, respectively, in the electrode upon lithiation.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Biological factors that influence the host range and spillover of Ebola
   virus (EBOV) and other filoviruses remain enigmatic. While filoviruses
   infect diverse mammalian cell lines, we report that cells from African
   straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) are refractory to EBOV
   infection. This could be explained by a single amino acid change in the
   filovirus receptor, NPC1, which greatly reduces the affinity of
   EBOV-NPC1 interaction. We found signatures of positive selection in bat
   NPC1 concentrated at the virus-receptor interface, with the strongest
   signal at the same residue that controls EBOV infection in Eidolon
   helvum cells. Our work identifies NPC1 as a genetic determinant of
   filovirus susceptibility in bats, and suggests that some NPC1 variations
   reflect host adaptations to reduce filovirus replication and virulence.
   A single viral mutation afforded escape from receptor control, revealing
   a pathway for compensatory viral evolution and a potential avenue for
   expansion of filovirus host range in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Erasure-correcting codes, which support local repair of codeword
   symbols, have attracted substantial attention recently for their
   application in distributed storage systems. This paper investigates a
   generalization of the usual locally repairable codes. In particular,
   this paper studies a class of codes with the following property: any
   small set of codeword symbols can be reconstructed (repaired) from a
   small number of other symbols. This is referred to as cooperative local
   repair. The main contribution of this paper is bounds on the trade-off
   of the minimum distance and the dimension of such codes, as well as
   explicit constructions of families of codes that enable cooperative
   local repair. Some other results regarding cooperative local repair are
   also presented, including an analysis for the well-known
   Hadamard/Simplex codes.}},

Abstract = {{Various active/inactive nanocomposites of Cu2Sb-Al2O3@C, Cu2Sb-TiC, and
   Cu2Sb-TiC@C have been synthesized by high energy mechanical milling and
   investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the
   lithiated phase stability and heat generation arising from these
   electrodes. The milling process reduces the Li3Sb phase stability,
   relative to the un-milled samples, to below similar to 200 degrees C.
   However, the incorporation of the reinforcing, inactive phases Al2O3,
   TiC, and carbon black offer a slight improvement. DSC curves also show
   that the low-temperature heat generation in the SEI-layer reaction range
   is not noticeably altered by either the milling process or the addition
   of the inactive phases. A strong exothermic peak is observed at similar
   to 200 degrees C for the 0\% state of charge electrodes of Cu2Sb-Al2O3@C
   and Cu2Sb-TiC@C that was caused by the incorporation of carbon black
   into the composite. This peak was not present in the electrodes of
   milled Cu2Sb or Cu2Sb-TiC, suggesting that efforts to extend the cycle
   life of alloy anodes should avoid carbon black due to its destabilizing
   effects on delithiated electrodes. Fourier Transform infrared
   spectroscopy analysis indicates that the reaction arising from the
   incorporation of carbon black is tied to a low-temperature breakdown of
   the lithium salt LiPF6. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Asymmetric light reflectance associated with localized surface plasmons
   excited in metal nanoparticles on a quartz substrate is observed and
   analyzed. This phenomenon is explained by the superposition of two
   waves, the wave reflected by the air/quartz interface and that reflected
   by the metal nanoparticles, and the resulting interference effects. Far
   field behavior investigation suggests that zero reflection can be
   achieved by optimizing the density of metal nanoparticles. Near field
   behavior investigation suggests that the coupling efficiency of
   localized surface plasmon can be additionally enhanced by separating the
   metal NPs from substrates using a thin film with refractive index
   smaller than the substrate. The latter behavior is confirmed via
   surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy studies using metal nanoparticles on

Title = {{The microbiome of the built environment and mental health}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{The microbiome of the built environment (MoBE) is a relatively new area
   of study. While some knowledge has been gained regarding impacts of the
   MoBE on the human microbiome and disease vulnerability, there is little
   knowledge of the impacts of the MoBE on mental health. Depending on the
   specific microbial species involved, the transfer of microorganisms from
   the built environment to occupant's cutaneous or mucosal membranes has
   the potential to increase or disrupt immunoregulation and/or exaggerate
   or suppress inflammation. Preclinical evidence highlighting the
   influence of the microbiota on systemic inflammation supports the
   assertion that microorganisms, including those originating from the
   built environment, have the potential to either increase or decrease the
   risk of inflammation-induced psychiatric conditions and their symptom
   severity. With advanced understanding of both the ecology of the built
   environment, and its influence on the human microbiome, it may be
   possible to develop bioinformed strategies for management of the built
   environment to promote mental health. Here we present a brief summary of
   microbiome research in both areas and highlight two interdependencies
   including the following: (1) effects of the MoBE on the human microbiome
   and (2) potential opportunities for manipulation of the MoBE in order to
   improve mental health. In addition, we propose future research
   directions including strategies for assessment of changes in the
   microbiome of common areas of built environments shared by multiple
   human occupants, and associated cohort-level changes in the mental
   health of those who spend time in the buildings. Overall, our
   understanding of the fields of both the MoBE and influence of
   host-associated microorganisms on mental health are advancing at a rapid
   pace and, if linked, could offer considerable benefit to health and
   wellness.}},

Abstract = {{The largest U.S. environmental health risk is cardiopulmonary mortality
   from ambient PM2.5. The concentration-response (C-R) for ambient PM2.5
   in the U.S. is generally assumed to be linear: from any initial
   baseline, a given concentration reduction would yield the same
   improvement in health risk. Recent evidence points to the perplexing
   possibility that the PM2.5 C-R for cardiopulmonary mortality and some
   other major endpoints might be supralinear: a given concentration
   reduction would yield greater improvements in health risk as the initial
   baseline becomes cleaner. We explore the implications of supralinearity
   for air policy, emphasizing U.S. conditions. If C-R is supralinear, an
   economically efficient PM2.5 target may be substantially more stringent
   than under current standards. Also, if a goal of air policy is to
   achieve the greatest health improvement per unit of PM2.5 reduction, the
   optimal policy might call for greater emission 7, cc reductions in
   already-clean locales-making ``blue skies bluer{''}-which may be at odds
   with environmental equity goals. Regardless of whether the C-R is linear
   or supralinear, the health benefits of attaining U.S. PM2.5 levels well
   below the current standard would be large. For the supralinear C-R
   considered here, attaining the current U.S. EPA standard, 12 mu g m(-3),
   would avert only similar to 17\% (if C-R is linear: similar to 25\%) of
   the total annual cardiopulmonary mortality attributable to PM2.5.}},

Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The distribution coefficient (K-lipw) of fullerene between solid
   supported lipid membranes (SSLMs) and water was examined using different
   lipid membrane compositions. K-lipw of fullerene was significantly
   higher with a cationic lipid membrane compared to that with a
   zwitterionic or anionic lipid membrane, potentially due to the strong
   interactions between negative fullerene dispersions and positive lipid
   head groups. The higher K-lipw for fullerene distribution to ternary
   lipid mixture membranes was attributed to an increase in the interfacial
   surface area of the lipid membrane resulting from phase separation.
   These results imply that lipid composition can be a critical factor that
   affects bioconcentration of fullerene. Distribution of fullerene into
   zwitterionic unsaturated lipid membranes was dominated by the entropy
   contribution (Delta S) and the process was endothermic (Delta H > 0).
   This result contrasts the partitioning thermodynamics of highly and
   moderately hydrophobic chemicals indicating that the lipid water
   distribution mechanism of fullerene may be different from that of
   molecular level chemicals. Potential mechanisms for the distribution of
   fullerene that may explain these differences include adsorption on the
   lipid membrane surfaces and partitioning into the center of lipid
   membranes (i.e., absorption).}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional magnetostatic cloaks, even when perfectly designed to
   mitigate the magnetic field disturbance of a scatterer, may be still
   detectable with Aharonov-Bohm (AB) measurements, and therefore may
   affect quantum interactions and experiments with elongated objects. We
   explore a multilayered cylindrical cloak whose permeability profile is
   tailored to nullify the magnetic-flux perturbation of the system,
   neutralizing its effect on AB measurements, and simultaneously optimally
   suppress the overall scattering. In this way, our improved magnetostatic
   cloak combines substantial mitigation of the magnetostatic scattering
   response with zero detectability by AB experiments.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Intensive studies of an advanced energy material are reported and
   lithium polyacrylate (LiPAA) is proven to be a surprisingly unique,
   multifunctional binder for high-voltage Li-ion batteries. The absence of
   effective passivation at the interface of high-voltage cathodes in
   Li-ion batteries may negatively affect their electrochemical
   performance, due to detrimental phenomena such as electrolyte solution
   oxidation and dissolution of transition metal cations. A strategy is
   introduced to build a stable cathode-electrolyte solution interphase for
   LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) spinel high-voltage cathodes during the electrode
   fabrication process by simply using LiPAA as the cathode binder. LiPAA
   is a superb binder due to unique adhesion, cohesion, and wetting
   properties. It forms a uniform thin passivating film on LNMO and
   conducting carbon particles in composite cathodes and also compensates
   Li-ion loss in full Li-ion batteries by acting as an extra Li source. It
   is shown that these positive roles of LiPAA lead to a significant
   improvement in the electrochemical performance (e.g., cycle life, cell
   impedance, and rate capability) of LNMO/graphite battery prototypes,
   compared with that obtained using traditional polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVdF) binder for LNMO cathodes. In addition, replacing PVdF with LiPAA
   binder for LNMO cathodes offers better adhesion, lower cost, and clear
   environmental advantages.}},

Title = {{Quantum transport simulation of exciton condensate transport physics in
   a double-layer graphene system}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Spatially indirect electron-hole exciton condensates stabilized by
   interlayer Fock exchange interactions have been predicted in systems
   containing a pair of two-dimensional semiconductor or semimetal layers
   separated by a thin tunnel dielectric. The layer degree of freedom in
   these systems can be described as a pseudospin. Condensation is then
   analogous to ferromagnetism, and the interplay between collective and
   quasiparticle contributions to transport is analogous to phenomena that
   are heavily studied in spintronics. These phenomena are the basis for
   pseudospintronic device proposals based on possible low-voltage
   switching between high (nearly shorted) and low interlayer conductance
   states and on near-perfect Coulomb drag-counterflow current along the
   layers. In this work, a quantum transport simulator incorporating a
   nonlocal Fock exchange interaction is presented, and used to model the
   essential transport physics in, for specificity, a
   graphene-dielectric-graphene system. Finite-size effects, Coulomb
   drag-counterflow current, critical interlayer currents beyond which
   interlayer dc conductance collapses at subthermal voltages, nonlocal
   coupling between interlayer critical currents in multiple lead devices,
   and an Andreev-like reflection process are illustrated.}},

   studies of Ag3VO4 have looked at its photoelectrochemical (PEC)

   material using standard physical and PEC techniques. We confirm a low
   bandgap of 2.2 eV and report the first results on chemical and
   electrochemical stability, intrinsic doping behavior, flat-band
   potential, and potential dependence of photocurrent. While our results
   are not initially promising with respect to the applicability of Ag3VO4
   to solar water splitting, they highlight the most important property
   changes necessary to make Ag3VO4 competitive with better known
   photocatalysts and the salience of thin-film studies for PEC material

Abstract = {{Despite widespread vaccination, pertussis rates are rising in

   therapeutics to treat disease, pertussis continues to cause considerable
   infant morbidity and mortality. The pertussis toxin is a major
   contributor to disease, responsible for local and systemic effects

   monoclonal antibodies that neutralize pertussis toxin and expressed them
   as human immunoglobulin G1 molecules with no loss of affinity or in
   vitro neutralization activity. When administered prophylactically to
   mice as a binary cocktail, antibody treatment completely mitigated the
   Bordetella pertussis-induced rise in white blood cell counts and
   decreased bacterial colonization. When administered therapeutically to
   baboons, antibody-treated, but not untreated control animals,
   experienced a blunted rise in white blood cell counts and accelerated
   bacterial clearance rates. These preliminary findings support further
   investigation into the use of these antibodies to treat human neonatal
   pertussis in conjunction with antibiotics and supportive care.}},

Title = {{Saltwater icephobicity: Influence of surface chemistry on saltwater
   icing}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Most studies on icephobicity focus on ice formation with pure water.
   This manuscript presents studies to understand the influence of surfaces
   on saltwater ice nucleation and propagation. Experiments are conducted
   to quantify the influence of surface chemistry on saltwater ice
   nucleation and to understand the utility of superhydrophobic surfaces
   for saltwater icephobicity. These experiments are conducted with pure
   water and two sodium chloride solutions, which represent the salinity of
   seawater and briny produced water. It is seen that the presence of salt
   slows down the ice front propagation velocity significantly. Saltwater
   droplet impact dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces are also different
   from pure water. Saltwater droplets retract more and a greater fraction
   of impacting liquid is repelled from the superhydrophobic surface. It is
   seen that the greater bounciness of saltwater droplets is a result of
   slower ice nucleation propagation kinetics. These experiments indicate
   that superhydrophobic surfaces will have better resistance to impact
   icing with saltwater than pure water and can remain useful at
   temperatures as low as -40 degrees C. Overall, this work is a starting
   point for further studies on heterogeneous nucleation in saltwater and
   serves as a bridge between the widely studied freshwater icephobic
   surfaces and saltwater-related applications.}},

Title = {{SINR and Throughput Scaling in Ultradense Urban Cellular Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{605-608}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We consider a dense urban cellular network where the base stations (BSs)
   are stacked vertically as well as extending infinitely in the horizontal
   plane, resulting in a greater than two dimensional (2D) deployment. We
   use a dual-slope path loss model that is well supported empirically,
   wherein a ``close-in{''} pathloss exponent alpha(0) is used for
   distances less than a corner distance R-c, and then changes to alpha(1)
   > alpha(0) outside R-c. We extend recent 2D coverage probability and
   potential throughput results to d dimensions, and prove that if the
   close-in path loss exponent alpha(0) < d, then the SINR eventually
   decays to zero. For example, alpha(0) <= 3 results in an eventual SINR
   of 0 for all users in a 3D network, which is a troubling fact. We also
   show that the potential (i.e. best case) aggregate throughput decays to

Abstract = {{We present a real-time volcano monitoring strategy that uses the Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and we examine the performance of
   the strategy by processing simulated and real data and comparing the
   results with published solutions. The cost of implementing the strategy
   is reduced greatly by using single-frequency GNSS receivers except for
   one dual-frequency receiver that serves as a base receiver. Positions of
   the single-frequency receivers are computed relative to the base
   receiver on an epoch-by-epoch basis using the high-rate
   double-difference (DD) GNSS technique, while the position of the base
   station is fixed to the values obtained with a deferred-time precise
   point positioning technique and updated on a regular basis. Since the
   performance of the single-frequency high-rate DD technique depends on
   the conditions of the ionosphere over the monitoring area, the
   ionospheric total electron content is monitored using the dual-frequency
   data from the base receiver. The surface deformation obtained with the
   high-rate DD technique is eventually processed by a real-time inversion
   filter based on the Mogi point source model. The performance of the
   real-time volcano monitoring strategy is assessed through a set of tests
   and case studies, in which the data recorded during the 2007 eruption of
   Kilauea and the 2005 eruption of Augustine are processed in a simulated
   real-time mode. The case studies show that the displacement time series
   obtained with the strategy seem to agree with those obtained with
   deferred-time, dual-frequency approaches at the level of 10-15 mm.
   Differences in the estimated volume change of the Mogi source between
   the real-time inversion filter and previously reported works were in the
   range of 11 to 13\% of the maximum volume changes of the cases examined.}},

Title = {{Completing Any Low-rank Matrix, Provably}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{2999-3034}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Matrix completion, i.e., the exact and provable recovery of a low-rank
   matrix from a small subset of its elements, is currently only known to
   be possible if the matrix satisfies a restrictive structural constraint
   known as incoherence-on its row and column spaces. In these cases, the
   subset of elements is assumed to be sampled uniformly at random.
   In this paper, we show that any rank-r n-by-n matrix can be exactly
   recovered from as few as O(nr log(2) n) randomly chosen elements,
   provided this random choice is made according to a specific biased
   distribution suitably dependent on the coherence structure of the
   matrix: the probability of any element being sampled should be at least
   a constant times the sum of the leverage scores of the corresponding row
   and column. Moreover, we prove that this specific form of sampling is
   nearly necessary, in a natural precise sense; this implies that many
   other perhaps more intuitive sampling schemes fail.
   We further establish three ways to use the above result for the setting
   when leverage scores are not known a priori. (a) We describe a
   provably-correct sampling strategy for the case when only the column
   space is incoherent and no assumption or knowledge of the row space is
   required. (b) We propose a two-phase sampling procedure for general
   matrices that first samples to estimate leverage scores followed by
   sampling for exact recovery. These two approaches assume control over
   the sampling procedure. (c) By using our main theorem in a reverse
   direction, we provide an analysis showing the advantages of the
   (empirically successful) weighted nuclear/trace-norm minimization
   approach over the vanilla un-weighted formulation given non-uniformly
   distributed observed elements. This approach does not require controlled
   sampling or knowledge of the leverage scores.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{3269-3297}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Numerous machine learning algorithms contain pairwise statistical
   problems at their core that is, tasks that require computations over all
   pairs of input points if implemented naively. Often, tree structures are
   used to solve these problems efficiently. Dual-tree algorithms can
   efficiently solve or approximate many of these problems. Using cover
   trees, rigorous worst case runtime guarantees have been proven for some
   of these algorithms. In this paper, we present a problem-independent
   runtime guarantee for any dual-tree algorithm using the cover tree,
   separating out the problem-dependent and the problem-independent
   elements. This allows us to just plug in bounds for the
   problem-dependent elements to get runtime guarantees for dual-tree
   algorithms for any pairwise statistical problem without re-deriving the
   entire proof. We demonstrate this plug-and-play procedure for
   nearest-neighbor search and approximate kernel density estimation to get
   improved runtime guarantees. Under mild assumptions, we also present the
   first linear runtime guarantee for dual-tree based range search.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1171-1195}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a phase field model for a fluid-driven
   fracture in a poroelastic medium. In our previous work, the pressure was
   assumed given. Here, we consider a fully coupled system where the
   pressure field is determined simultaneously with the displacement and
   the phase field. To the best of our knowledge, such a model is new in
   the literature. The mathematical model consists of a linear elasticity
   system with fading elastic moduli as the crack grows, which is coupled
   with an elliptic variational inequality for the phase field variable and
   with the pressure equation containing the phase field variable in its
   coefficients. The convex constraint of the variational inequality
   assures the irreversibility and entropy compatibility of the crack
   formation. The phase field variational inequality contains quadratic
   pressure and strain terms, with coefficients depending on the phase
   field unknown. We establish existence of a solution to the incremental
   problem through convergence of a finite dimensional approximation.
   Furthermore, we construct the corresponding Lyapunov functional that is
   linked to the free energy. Computational results are provided that
   demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in treating fluid-driven
   fracture propagation.}},

   Intraslope Basin Province: I. Sediment facies and depositional processes}},
Journal = {{GEOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1689-1718}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Very high-resolution seismic facies, classified, mapped, and interpreted
   from 3.5 kHz echograms, reveal that turbidity-current, mass-transport,
   and bottom-current depositional processes have all contributed to the
   regional sediment distribution in the intraslope basin province of the
   northwest Gulf of Mexico. Piston cores from these deposits confirm the
   interpretations of the processes. Turbidity currents transport sands
   into the intraslope mini-basins via channels and canyons. A few
   turbidity-current pathways, such as Bryant Canyon, allow extensive
   volumes of terrigenous sediment to bypass through many mini-basins and
   be deposited beyond the Sigsbee Escarpment to form large submarine fans,
   such as Bryant Fan. Bryant Fan is a large mud-rich fan that extends
   hundreds of kilometers from the mouth of Bryant Canyon but has only one
   meandering channel on the modern seafloor that extends down the length
   of the fan. In contrast, the much smaller Rio Grande Submarine Fan is
   deposited on a plateau area of the continental slope. Prolonged 3.5 echo
   character and numerous small, unleveed channels suggest this is a
   sand-rich fan with a braided channel system. These two submarine fans
   appear to present unique architectural and growth patterns not
   previously described in the numerous fan descriptions of W.R. Normark or
   other workers. Thus, these two fans appear to represent two new types of
   fans, which may be related to the complex structures of the intraslope
   basin province. Mass-transport deposits (MTDs) are ubiquitous throughout
   the mini-basins. Extensive areas affected by MTDs also occur along the
   upper continental slope and at the base of the eastern portion of the
   Sigsbee Escarpment. Piston cores confirm that the majority of MTDs are
   debris flows, which are characterized by mud clasts of variable size,
   shape, and color. Most have a muddy matrix, but sandy debris flows also
   occur in a few mini-basins. Some cores show deformation, folds, and
   faults that indicate slump or slide deposits. The East Breaks Slide
   Complex is the largest MTD complex and extends downslope from the shelf
   edge for >100 km off central Texas. The western portion of the complex
   is slump and/or slide blocks and debris flows. In contrast, the proximal
   part of the eastern portion of the complex is characterized by a modern
   leveed turbidite channel system. However, extensive MTDs underlie the
   channel-levee deposits and occur at the seafloor on the distal part of
   the eastern portion of the complex. Three large regions of migrating
   sediment waves occur on the Sigsbee Abyssal Plain and eastern Bryant Fan
   and appear to have been formed by circulation of the Loop Current.
   Sediment waves also occur locally at the base of the Sigsbee Escarpment
   in conjunction with previously reported erosional furrows.}},

Abstract = {{Cryotherapy involves the surface application of low temperatures to
   enhance the healing of soft tissue injuries. Typical devices embody a
   remote source of chilled water that is pumped through a circulation
   bladder placed on the treatment site. In contrast, the present device
   uses thermoelectric refrigeration modules to bring the cooling source
   directly to the tissue to be treated, thereby achieving significant
   improvements in control of therapeutic temperature while having a
   reduced size and weight. A prototype system was applied to test an
   oscillating cooling and heating protocol for efficacy in regulating skin
   blood perfusion in the treatment area. Data on 12 human subjects
   indicate that thermoelectric coolers (TECs) delivered significant and
   sustainable changes in perfusion for both heating (increase by (+/-SE)
   173.0666.0\%, P<0.005) and cooling (decrease by (+/-SE) 57.764.2\%,
   P<0.0005), thus supporting the feasibility of a TEC-based device for
   cryotherapy with local temperature regulation.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Monolayer (ML) transition metal dichalcogenides are novel, gapped
   two-dimensional materials with unique electrical and optical properties.
   Toward device applications, we consider MoS2 layers on dielectrics, in
   particular in this work, the effect of vacancies on the electronic
   structure. In density-functional based simulations, we consider the
   effects of near-interface O vacancies in the oxide slab, and Moor S
   vacancies in the MoS2 layer. Band structures and atom-projected
   densities of states for each system and with differing oxide
   terminations were calculated, as well as those for the defect-free
   MoS2-dielectrics system and for isolated dielectric layers for
   reference. Among our results, we find that with O vacancies, both the
   Hf-terminated HfO2-MoS2 system, and the O-terminated and H-passivated
   Al2O3-MoS2 systems appear metallic due to doping of the oxide slab
   followed by electron transfer into the MoS2, in manner analogous to
   modulation doping. The n-type doping of ML MoS2 by high-k oxides with
   oxygen vacancies then is experimentally demonstrated by electrically and
   spectroscopically characterizing back-gated ML MoS2 field effect
   transistors encapsulated by oxygen deficient alumina and hafnia.}},

   integration with Si, Ge, and other semiconductors}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a proven technique for the conformal
   deposition of oxide thin films with nanoscale thickness control. Most
   successful industrial applications have been with binary oxides, such as
   Al2O3 and HfO2. However, there has been much effort to deposit ternary
   oxides, such as perovskites (ABO(3)), with desirable properties for
   advanced thin film applications. Distinct challenges are presented by
   the deposition of multi-component oxides using ALD. This review is
   intended to highlight the research of the many groups that have
   deposited perovskite oxides by ALD methods. Several commonalities
   between the studies are discussed. Special emphasis is put on precursor
   selection, deposition temperatures, and specific property performance
   (high-k, ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, etc.). Finally, the monolithic
   integration of perovskite oxides with semiconductors by ALD is reviewed.
   High-quality epitaxial growth of oxide thin films has traditionally been
   limited to physical vapor deposition techniques (e.g., molecular beam
   epitaxy). However, recent studies have demonstrated that epitaxial oxide
   thin films may be deposited on semiconductor substrates using ALD. This
   presents an exciting opportunity to integrate functional perovskite
   oxides for advanced semiconductor applications in a process that is
   economical and scalable. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Melt extraction from the Earth's mantle through high-porosity channels
   is required to explain the composition of the oceanic crust. Feedbacks
   from reactive melt transport are thought to localize melt into a network
   of high-porosity channels. Recent studies invoke lithological
   heterogeneities in the Earth's mantle to seed the localization of
   partial melts. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the reaction
   fronts that form as melt flows across the lithological interface between
   the heterogeneity and the ambient mantle. Here we present a
   chromatographic analysis of reactive melt transport across lithological
   boundaries, using the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws. This is an
   extension of linear trace element chromatography to the coupling of
   major elements and energy transport. Our analysis allows the prediction
   of the nonlinear feedbacks that arise in reactive melt transport due to
   changes in porosity. This study considers the special case of a
   partially molten porous medium with binary solid solution. As melt
   traverses a lithological contact, binary solid solution leads to the
   formation of a reacted zone between an advancing reaction front and the
   initial contact. The analysis also shows that the behavior of a fertile
   heterogeneity depends on its absolute concentration, in addition to
   compositional differences between itself and the refractory background.
   We present a regime diagram that predicts if melt emanating from a
   fertile heterogeneity localizes into high-porosity channels or develops
   a zero porosity shell. The theoretical framework presented here provides
   a useful tool for understanding nonlinear feedbacks in reactive melt
   transport, because it can be extended to more complex and realistic
   phase behaviors.}},

   Signatures of Translation Dynamics in Yeast}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ribosome profiling produces snapshots of the locations of actively
   translating ribosomes on messenger RNAs. These snapshots can be used to
   make inferences about translation dynamics. Recent ribosome profiling
   studies in yeast, however, have reached contradictory conclusions
   regarding the average translation rate of each codon. Some experiments
   have used cycloheximide (CHX) to stabilize ribosomes before measuring
   their positions, and these studies all counterintuitively report a weak
   negative correlation between the translation rate of a codon and the
   abundance of its cognate tRNA. In contrast, some experiments performed
   without CHX report strong positive correlations. To explain this
   contradiction, we identify unexpected patterns in ribosome density
   downstream of each type of codon in experiments that use CHX. These
   patterns are evidence that elongation continues to occur in the presence
   of CHX but with dramatically altered codon-specific elongation rates.
   The measured positions of ribosomes in these experiments therefore do
   not reflect the amounts of time ribosomes spend at each position in
   vivo. These results suggest that conclusions from experiments in yeast
   using CHX may need reexamination. In particular, we show that in all
   such experiments, codons decoded by less abundant tRNAs were in fact
   being translated more slowly before the addition of CHX disrupted these
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Novel adjustments are introduced to the docking algorithm, DOCK/PIERR,
   for the purpose of predicting structures of transmembrane protein
   complexes. Incorporating knowledge about the membrane environment is
   shown to significantly improve docking accuracy. The extended version of
   DOCK/PIERR is shown to perform comparably to other leading docking
   packages. This membrane version of DOCK/PIERR is applied to the
   prediction of coiled-coil homodimer structures of the transmembrane
   region of the C-terminal peptide of amyloid precursor protein (C99).
   Results from MD simulation of the C99 homodimer in POPC bilayer and
   docking are compared. Docking results are found to capture key aspects
   of the homodimer ensemble, including the existence of three
   topologically distinct conformers. Furthermore, the extended version of
   DOCK/PIERR is successful in capturing the effects of solvation in
   membrane and micelle. Specifically, DOCK/PIERR reproduces essential
   differences in the homodimer ensembles simulated in POPC bilayer and DPC
   micelle, where configurational entropy and surface curvature effects
   bias the handedness and topology of the homodimer ensemble. (C) 2015

Title = {{Assessment of liquefaction evaluation procedures and severity index

Abstract = {{The objective of the study presented herein is to assess three commonly
   used CPT-based liquefaction evaluation procedures and three liquefaction
   severity index frameworks using data from the 2010-2011 Canterbury
   earthquake sequence. Specifically, post-event field observations, ground
   motion recordings, and results from a recently completed extensive
   geotechnical site investigation programme at selected strong motion
   stations (SMSs) in the city of Christchurch and surrounding towns are
   used herein. Unlike similar studies that used data from free-field
   sites, accelerogram characteristics at the SMS locations can be used to
   assess the performance of liquefaction evaluation procedures prior to
   their use in the computation of surficial manifestation severity
   indices. Results from this study indicate that for cases with evidence
   of liquefaction triggering in the accelerograms, the majority of
   liquefaction evaluation procedures yielded correct predictions,
   regardless of whether surficial manifestation of liquefaction was
   evident or not. For cases with no evidence of liquefaction in the
   accelerograms (and no observed surficial evidence of liquefaction
   triggering), the majority of liquefaction evaluation procedures
   predicted liquefaction was triggered. When all cases are used to assess
   the performance of liquefaction severity index frameworks, a poor
   correlation is shown between the observed severity of liquefaction
   surface manifestation and the calculated severity indices. However, only
   using those cases where the liquefaction evaluation procedures yielded
   correct predictions, there is an improvement in the correlation, with
   the Liquefaction Severity Number (LSN) being the best performing of the
   frameworks investigated herein. However scatter in the relationship
   between the observed and calculated surficial manifestation still
   remains for all liquefaction severity index frameworks. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{For colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), replacement of

   clusters enables the development of functional solids in which adjacent
   NCs are strongly coupled. Yet controlled assembly methods are lacking to
   direct the arrangement of charged, inorganic cluster-capped NCs into
   open networks. Herein, we introduce coordination bonds between the
   clusters capping the NCs thus linking the NCs into highly open gel
   networks. As linking cations (Pt2+) are added to dilute (under 1 vol\%)
   chalcogenidometallate-capped CdSe NC dispersions, the NCs first form
   clusters, then gels with viscoelastic properties. The phase behavior of
   the gels for variable {[}Pt2+] suggests they may represent nanoscale
   analogues of bridged particle gels, which have been observed to form in
   certain polymer colloidal suspensions.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) pore-scale models have successfully simulated
   microfluidic experiments of aqueous-phase flow with mixing-controlled
   reactions in devices with small aperture. A standard 2D model is not
   generally appropriate when the presence of mineral precipitate or
   biomass creates complex and irregular three-dimensional (3D) pore
   geometries. We modify the 2D lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to
   incorporate viscous drag from the top and bottom microfluidic device
   (micromodel) surfaces, typically excluded in a 2D model. Viscous drag
   from these surfaces can be approximated by uniformly scaling a
   steady-state 2D velocity field at low Reynolds number. We demonstrate
   increased accuracy by approximating the viscous drag with an
   analytically-derived body force which assumes a local parabolic velocity
   profile across the micromodel depth. Accuracy of the generated 2D
   velocity field and simulation permeability have not been evaluated in
   geometries with variable aperture. We obtain permeabilities within
   approximately 10\% error and accurate streamlines from the proposed 2D
   method relative to results obtained from 3D simulations. In addition,
   the proposed method requires a CPU run time approximately 40 times less
   than a standard 3D method, representing a significant computational
   benefit for permeability calculations.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we apply angular momentum-biased metamaterials to break
   the intrinsic reciprocity of antenna systems, with potential
   applications to satellite communications. We focus our attention on a
   conical horn antenna exhibiting nonreciprocal response for left-handed
   and right-handed circularly polarized fields. A metallic screen with an
   annular aperture is placed between the feeding waveguide and the horn.
   This inclusion is loaded with modulated capacitors to achieve a
   nonreciprocal transmittance for circularly polarized fields impinging
   from opposite sides. We present the analysis of the nonreciprocal
   annular inclusion and explain its nonreciprocal response, obtained
   through proper spatiotemporal modulation, with the help of an equivalent
   transmission-line representation. A possible practical implementation of
   the modulation circuit based on band-pass and band-stop filters is also
   discussed. The electrical and radiating performance of the conical horn
   is numerically evaluated, showing the ability of the proposed antenna to
   filter signals with same polarization in two separate bands, e. g.,
   uplink and downlink bands of a satellite link, depending on the
   propagation direction of the signal. These results may pave the way to
   several interesting applications of nonreciprocal radiators in satellite
   and radar systems.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels have been influential in the development of controlled release
   systems for a wide variety of therapeutic agents. These materials are
   attractive as carriers for transmucosal and intracellular drug delivery
   because of their inherent biocompatibility, tunable physicochemical
   properties, basic synthesis, and ability to be physiologically
   responsive. Due to their hydrophilic nature, hydrogel-based carrier
   systems are not always the best systems for delivery of small molecular
   weight, hydrophobic therapeutic agents. In this work, versatile
   hydrogel-based carriers composed of copolymers of methyl methacrylate
   (MMA) and acrylic acid (AA) were designed and synthesized to create
   formulations for oral delivery of small molecular weight therapeutic
   agents. Through practical material selection and careful design of
   copolymer composition and molecular architecture, we engineered systems
   capable of responding to physiological changes, with tunable
   physicochemical properties that are optimized to load, protect, and
   deliver their payloads to their intended site of action. The synthesized
   carriers' ability to respond to changes in pH, to load and release small
   molecular weight drugs, and biocompatibility were investigated. Our
   results suggest these hydrophilic networks have great potential for
   controlled delivery of small-molecular weight, hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic agents. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrate-bearing sands are being actively explored because they contain
   the highest concentrations of hydrate and are the most economically
   recoverable hydrate resource. However, relatively little is known about
   the mechanisms or timescales of hydrate formation, which are related to
   methane supply, fluid flux, and host sediment properties such as
   permeability. We used logging-while-drilling data from locations in the
   northern Gulf of Mexico to develop an effective medium theory-based
   model for predicting permeability based on clay-sized sediment fraction.
   The model considers permeability varying between sand and clay endpoint
   permeabilities that are defined from laboratory data. We verified the
   model using permeability measurements on core samples from three
   boreholes, and then used the model to predict permeability in two wells
   drilled in Walker Ridge Block 313 during the Gulf of Mexico Gas Hydrate
   Joint Industry Project Leg II expedition in 2009. We found that the
   cleanest sands (clay-sized fraction <0.05) had intrinsic (hydrate-free)
   permeability contrasts of 5-6 orders of magnitude with the surrounding
   clays, which is sufficient to provide focused hydrate formation due to
   advection of methane from a deep source or diffusion of microbial
   methane from nearby clay layers. In sands where the clay-sized fraction
   exceeds 0.05, the permeability reduces significantly and focused flow is
   less pronounced. In these cases, diffusion of dissolved microbial
   methane is most likely the preferred mode of methane supply for hydrate
   formation. Our results provide important constraints on methane supply
   mechanisms in the Walker Ridge area and have global implications for
   evaluating rates of methane migration and hydrate formation in
   hydrate-bearing sands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous ultrathin graphite foams (UGFs) have been actively researched
   recently to obtain composite materials with increased thermal
   conductivities. However, the large pore size of these graphitic foams
   has resulted in large thermal resistance values for heat conduction from
   inside the pore to the high thermal conductivity graphitic struts. Here,
   we demonstrate that the effective thermal conductivity of these UGF
   composites can be increased further by growing long CNT networks
   directly from the graphite struts of UGFs into the pore space. When
   erythritol, a phase change material for thermal energy storage, is used
   to fill the pores of UGF-CNT hybrids, the thermal conductivity of the
   UGF-CNT/erythritol composite was found to increase by as much as a
   factor of 1.8 compared to that of a UGF/erythritol composite, whereas
   breaking the UGF-CNT bonding in the hybrid composite resulted in a drop
   in the effective room-temperature thermal conductivity from about 4.1
   +/- 0.3W m(-1) K-1 to about 2.9 +/- 0.2 W m(-1) K-1 for the same UGF and
   CNT loadings of about 1.8 and 0.8 wt \%, respectively. Moreover, we
   discovered that the hybrid structure strongly suppresses subcooling of
   erythritol due to the heterogeneous nucleation of erythritol at
   interfaces with the graphitic structures.}},

Abstract = {{PM2.5 pollution in Delhi averaged 150 mu g/m(3) from 2012 through 2014,
   which is 15 times higher than the World Health Organization's
   annual-average guideline. For this setting, we present on-road exposure
   of PM2.5 concentrations for 11 transport microenvironments along a fixed
   8.3-km arterial route, during morning rush hour. The data collection was
   carried out using a portable TSI DustTrak DRX 8433 aerosol monitor,
   between January and May (2014). The monthly-average measured ambient
   concentrations varied from 130 mu g/m(3) to 250 mu g/m(3). The on-road
   PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the ambient measurements by an average of
   40\% for walking, 10\% for cycle, 30\% for motorised two wheeler (2W),
   30\% for open-windowed (OW) car, 30\% for auto rickshaw, 20\% for
   air-conditioned as well as for OW bus, 20\% for bus stop, and 30\% for
   underground metro station. On the other hand, concentrations were lower
   by 50\% inside air-conditioned (AC) car and 20\% inside the metro rail
   carriage. We find that the percent exceedance for open modes (cycle,
   auto rickshaw, 2W, OW car, and OW bus) reduces non-linearly with
   increasing ambient concentration. The reduction is steeper at
   concentrations lower than 150 mu g/m(3) than at higher concentrations.
   After accounting for air inhalation rate and speed of travel, PM2.5 mass
   uptake per kilometer during cycling is 9 times of AC car, the mode with
   the lowest exposure. At current level of concentrations, an hour of
   cycling in Delhi during morning rush-hour period results in PM2.5 dose
   which is 40\% higher than an entire-day dose in cities like Tokyo,
   London, and New York, where ambient concentrations range from 10 to 20
   mu g/m(3). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a first-order scaling-friendly VCO-based closed-loop

   which cancels out even-order distortions. Most importantly, it has an
   inherit mismatch shaping capability that automatically addresses the DAC
   mismatches. The prototype Delta Sigma ADC in 130 nm CMOS occupies a
   small area of only 0.03 and achieves 66.5 dB SNDR over 2 MHz BW while
   sampling at 300 MHz and consuming 1.8 mW from a 1.2 V power supply. It
   can also operate with a low analog supply of 0.7 V and achieves 65.8 dB

   the self-consistent two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo
   Collisions model. These microdischarges were recently proposed for use
   as fast switches of visible light in Bataller et al. {[}Appl. Phys.
   Lett. 105, 223501 (2014)]. The microdischarge is found to develop in two
   stages. The first stage is associated with the electrons initially
   seeded in the cathode-anode gap. These electrons lead to the formation
   of a cathode-directed streamer. The second stage starts when the
   secondary electron emission from the cathode begins. In this stage, a
   rather dense plasma (similar to 10(16) cm(-3)) is generated which
   results in the narrow cathode sheath. The electric field in this sheath
   exceeds the critical electric field which is necessary for the runaway
   electrons generation. We have found that the presence of these energetic
   electrons is crucial for the discharge maintenance. (c) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to develop and present a simple procedure
   for evaluating the temperature and exposure-time conditions that lead to
   causation of a deep-partial thickness burn and the effect that the
   immediate post-burn thermal environment can have on the process. A
   computational model has been designed and applied to predict the time
   required for skin burns to reach a deep-partial thickness level of
   injury. The model includes multiple tissue layers including the
   epidermis, dermis, hypodermis, and subcutaneous tissue. Simulated
   exposure temperatures ranged from 62.8 to 87.8 degrees C (145-190
   degrees F). Two scenarios were investigated. The first and worst case
   scenario was a direct exposure to water (characterized by a large
   convection coefficient) with the clothing left on the skin following the
   exposure. A second case consisted of a scald insult followed immediately
   by the skin being washed with cool water (20 degrees C). For both cases,
   an Arrhenius injury model was applied whereby the extent and depth of
   injury were calculated and compared for the different post-bum
   treatments. In addition, injury values were compared with experiment
   data from the literature to assess verification of the numerical
   methodology. It was found that the clinical observations of injury
   extent agreed with the calculated values. Furthermore, inundation with
   cool water decreased skin temperatures more quickly than the clothing
   insulating case and led to a modest decrease in the burn extent. (C)

Abstract = {{Plastic straining can initiate and propagate abnormal grains at
   temperatures significantly lower than is possible by static annealing.
   This phenomenon is termed dynamic abnormal grain growth (DAGG).
   Experiments that produce DAGG in commercial-purity molybdenum sheet
   materials are used to study the initiation and propagation of abnormal
   grains by plastic straining at temperatures from 1673 K to 2073 K (1400
   degrees C to 1800 degrees C). The minimum strain necessary to initiate
   DAGG, termed the critical strain, decreases approximately linearly with
   increasing temperature. The variation in critical strain values observed
   at a single temperature and strain rate is well described by a normal
   distribution. An increased fraction of grains aligned with the < 110 >
   along the tensile axis, a preferred orientation for DAGG grains, appears
   to decrease the critical strain for DAGG initiation. DAGG grains
   preferentially grow into the finest-grained polycrystalline regions,
   which suggests that the driving force for DAGG propagation is primarily
   from grain-boundary curvature. No effects of local crystallographic
   texture variation on growth are evident in microstructures containing
   DAGG grains. Together, these observations support the hypothesis that
   plastic straining during DAGG acts primarily to increase boundary
   mobility, rather than to increase the driving force for boundary
   migration. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{Injectivity decline is an issue during produced-water reinjection (PWRI)
   for water disposal in aquifers, waterflooding, chemical enhanced oil
   recovery, and geothermal-energy exploitation. A novel model for
   injectivity decline under flow conditions reminiscent of PWRI was
   developed taking into account deep-bed filtration and buildup of
   external filter cake. A distinct feature of the model is that it
   describes particle-retention kinetics responsible for internal
   filtration by an exponential decaying function of the retained-particle
   concentration. The corresponding nonlinear governing
   partial-differential equations were solved numerically and coupled with
   a known analytical model for external filtration with the concept of
   transition time. Coreflood experiments consisting of the injection of
   brine containing suspended hematite particles (volume fractions in the
   range of 2 to 6 ppm) were also performed. Computed-tomography (CT) scans
   of the core were taken to obtain deposition profiles along the core at
   different times. In addition, effect of various parameters (particle
   concentration and number of grids) on injectivity was investigated. From
   CT-scan and optical-microscope analyses, it was found that surface
   deposition in the porous medium and face plugging at the injection face
   of the core were responsible for decline in injectivity. The transition
   time from pure internal to external filtration was accurately determined
   from the CT-scan and pressure data. The newly proposed model and
   experiments were found to be in excellent agreement, indicating that the
   adopted retention function is a good heuristic description of particle
   retention.}},

Abstract = {{The dielectric constant or relative permittivity (6,.) of a dielectric
   material, which describes how the net electric field in the medium is
   reduced with respect to the external field, is a parameter of critical
   importance for charging and screening in electronic devices. Such a
   fundamental material property is intimately related to not only the
   polarizability of individual atoms but also the specific atomic
   arrangement in the crystal lattice. In this Letter, we present both
   experimental and theoretical investigations on the dielectric constant
   of few-layer In2Se3 nanoflakes grown on mica substrates by van der Waals
   epitaxy. A nondestructive microwave impedance microscope is employed to
   simultaneously quantify the number of layers and local electrical
   properties. The measured a,. increases monotonically as a function of
   the thickness and saturates to the bulk value at around 6-8 quintuple
   layers. The same trend of layer-dependent dielectric constant is also
   revealed by first-principles calculations. Our results of the dielectric
   response, being ubiquitously applicable to layered 2D semiconductors,
   are expected to be significant for this vibrant research field.}},

Title = {{Characterizing the hydraulic interactions of hurricane storm surge and

Abstract = {{Planning of traditional coastal flood risk management strategies are
   largely predicated on storm surge protection against extreme hurricanes,
   i.e. storm surge. However, (1) hurricane storm surge and (2) hurricane
   rainfall-runoff are not mutually exclusive flood hazards. Little
   research has emphasized the need for quantifying and characterizing the
   joint hydraulic processes between hurricane storm surge and
   rainfall-runoff during real events for enhancing effective flood risk
   mitigation. In this regard, an improved hydrological and hydrodynamic
   modeling framework has been developed for the Houston Ship Channel (HSC)
   and Galveston Bay to serve as a quantitative testbed for evaluating
   coupled hurricane storm surge and rainfall-runoff. Modularity within the
   modeling framework allows for landfall shifting of historical hurricane
   tracks, wind fields, and corresponding rainfall patterns to serve as
   numerical model inputs, as well as providing an expanded dataset of
   storm events. Distributed hydrologic and unsteady hydraulic analyses of
   upstream rainfall-runoff and storm surge are conducted for hurricanes
   Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), and Isaac (2012) under three synthetically
   shifted landfall locations near the HSC and Galveston Bay regions. For
   the modeled scenarios, results show that peak flows from storm surge
   easily dominate those of rainfall-runoff, but that rainfall-runoff can
   constitute more than half of the total flood volume draining towards the
   HSC. Most modeled scenarios reveal less than 24 h of separation between
   peak surge and peak rainfall-runoff. In the same way that storm surge is
   sensitive to hurricane landfall location and angle of approach, so are
   spatial rainfall distributions and associated inland runoff processes,
   due to wide topological variations in coastal watershed boundaries.
   Analysis of coastal flood mitigation is extended with the dynamic
   modeling of a proposed storm surge barrier system at the HSC, with its
   performance quantified under the given hurricanes. The surge barrier
   system is demonstrated to be hydraulically feasible for all scenarios,
   with maximum water surface elevation reductions ranging between 0.63 m
   and 3.28 m. However, accurate storm surge and riverine flood forecasting
   methods will be critical for achieving optimal gate and barrier
   operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{947-979}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is on the development of an origin-destination
   (O-D) demand estimation method for dynamic equilibrium traffic networks.
   It is hypothesized that the underlying equilibrium conditions in such
   networks are a compromise result of minimization of individual routing
   costs, minimization of traffic count matching errors, and maximization
   of O-D demand entropies. By adding an upper bound of travel demand and a
   dummy path with constant travel cost to each O-D pair, we formulated the
   dynamic O-D demand estimation problem as an excess-demand dynamic
   traffic assignment (DTA) problem defined for an expanded network with
   dummy paths. Such a formulation enables us to apply existing DTA
   solution methods and software tools for deriving the path flow pattern
   in the expanded network and thus simultaneously obtaining the O-D demand
   pattern in the original network. Following this problem transformation
   and network expansion strategy, an iterative solution procedure is
   accordingly proposed, which resorts to repeatedly solving the
   excess-demand DTA problem and adjusting the dummy path costs. An
   application of the proposed modeling and solution methods for an example
   cell-based network problem favorably illustrates great promise of the
   methodological advance and solution performance.}},

Title = {{Reduced order modeling of flashing two-phase jets}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{294}},
Pages = {{60-72}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In the event of a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) in a pressurized water
   reactor, the escaping coolant produces a highly energetic flashing jet
   with the potential to damage surrounding structures. In LOCA analysis,
   the goal is often to evaluate many break scenarios in a Monte Carlo
   style simulation to evaluate the resilience of a reactor design.
   Therefore, in order to quickly predict the damage potential of flashing
   jets, it is of interest to develop a reduced order model that relates
   the damage potential of a jet to the pressure and temperature upstream
   of the break and the distance from the break to a given object upon
   which the jet is impinging. This work presents framework for producing a
   Reduced Order Model (ROM) that may be informed by measured data,
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, or a combination of
   both. The model is constructed by performing regression analysis on the
   pressure field data, allowing the impingement pressure to be quickly
   reconstructed for any given upstream thermodynamic condition within the
   range of input data. The model is applicable to both free and fully
   impinging two-phase flashing jets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A mode transformer based on the quasi-vertical taper is designed to
   enable high coupling efficiency for interboard-level optical
   interconnects involving single-mode polymer waveguides and standard
   single-mode fibers. A triangular region fabricated above the waveguide
   is adopted to adiabatically transform the mode from the fiber into the

   taper, including width, height, tip width, etc., on the coupling
   efficiency are numerically investigated. Based on this, a quasi-vertical
   taper for the polymer rib waveguide system is designed, fabricated, and
   characterized. Coupling losses of 1.79 +/- 0.30 and 2.23 +/- 0.31 dB per
   coupler for the quasi-TM and quasi-TE mode, respectively, are measured
   across the optical communication C and L bands (1535 to 1610 nm).
   Low-cost packaging, leading to widespread utilization of polymeric

Abstract = {{The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) has been commonly used to assimilate
   real time dynamic data into geologic models over the past decade.
   Despite its various advantages such as computational efficiency and its
   capability to handle multiple sources of uncertainty, the EnKF may not
   be used to reliably update models that are characterized by curvilinear
   geometries such as fluvial deposits where the permeable channels play a
   crucial role in the prediction of solute transport. It is well-known
   that the EnKF performs optimally for updating multi-Gaussian distributed
   fields, basically because it uses two-point statistics (i.e.,
   covariances) to represent the relationship between the model parameters
   and between the model parameters and the observed response, and this is
   the only statistic necessary to fully characterize a multiGaussian
   distribution. The Ensemble PATtern matching (EnPAT) is an alternative
   ensemble based method that shows significant potential to condition
   complex geology such as channelized aquifers to dynamic data. The EnPAT
   is an evolution of the EnKF, replacing, in the analysis step, two-point
   statistics with multiple-point statistics. The advantages of EnPAT
   reside in its capability to honor the complex spatial connectivity of
   geologic structures as well as the measured static and dynamic data In
   this work, the performance of the classical EnKF and the EnPAT are
   compared for modeling a synthetic channelized aquifer. The results
   reveal that the EnPAT yields a better prediction of transport
   characteristics than the EnKF because it characterizes the conductivity
   heterogeneity better. Issues such as uncertainty of multiple variables
   and the effect of measurement errors on EnPAT results will be discussed.

Abstract = {{Rehabilitation of the hands is critical for the restoration of
   independence in activities of daily living for individuals exhibiting
   disabilities of the upper extremities. There is initial evidence that
   robotic devices with force-control-based strategies can help in
   effective rehabilitation of human limbs. However, to the best of our
   knowledge, none of the existing hand exoskeletons allow for accurate
   force or torque control. In this work, we present a novel index finger
   exoskeleton with Bowden-cable-based series elastic actuation allowing
   for bidirectional torque control of the device with high backdrivability
   and low reflected inertia. We present exoskeleton and finger joint
   torque controllers along with an optimization-based offline parameter
   estimator. Finally, we carry out tests with the developed prototype to
   characterize its kinematics, dynamics, and controller performance.
   Results show that the device preserves the characteristics of natural
   motion of finger and can be controlled to achieve both exoskeleton and
   finger joint torque control. Finally, dynamic transparency tests show
   that the device can be controlled to offer minimal resistance to finger
   motion. Beyond the present application of the device as a hand
   rehabilitation exoskeleton, it has the potential to be used as a haptic
   device for teleoperation.}},

Abstract = {{Orbital motion of spacecraft under the action of constant-thrust
   acceleration in the direction perpendicular to the velocity is studied.
   A spacecraft starting in an initial circular orbit obtains a minimum
   (perigee) radius along an inbound trajectory. If the thrust is
   maintained, the spacecraft returns to the initial circular orbit in an
   outbound trajectory. A maximum (apogee) radius is obtained when starting
   in a circular orbit along an outbound trajectory, after which the
   vehicle returns to its initial orbit. Only one integral of motion is
   known to exist in this system; therefore, a full analytical solution
   cannot be found. However, an analytical solution to the flight-direction
   angle (that is, the angle between the position and velocity vectors) is
   found in terms of the position magnitude. This solution leads to several
   insights, such as an analytical expression for the range of acceleration
   magnitudes that enables prograde motion. Periodic orbits are also found
   in this system for various values of acceleration, and their stability
   is studied. Even though a full analytical solution is not provided, a
   finite Taylor expansion about the acceleration magnitude yields an
   approximate analytical solution for the trajectory beginning on a
   circular orbit.}},

Title = {{Physics based HLD-NAC phase behavior model for surfactant/crude

Abstract = {{Compositional simulation of surfactant flooding highly depends on
   accurate modeling of surfactant/oil/brine microemulsion phase behavior.
   This paper introduces a physics-based Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Difference
   (HLD) equation and the Net-Average Curvature (NAC) called thereafter
   HLD-NAC equation of state to model the phase behavior of
   surfactant/crude oil/brine systems. A non-iterative and physics-based
   algorithm is developed and validated by modeling the solubilization
   ratio curves and phase volume fraction of different microemulsion
   systems.
   The HLD values are calculated by the natural logarithm of salinity over
   optimum salinity when lacking of oil hydrophobicity and surfactant
   Characteristic curvature information. Together with lab measured head
   area of per surfactant molecule, the HLD-NAC model reproduces the
   microemulsion phase behavior of various formulations for surfactant
   flooding with only one fitting parameter, the length constant L, which
   physically represents the surfactant tail length size. Modeling results
   show that the fitted parameter increases with the surfactant or
   surfactant mixture tail length in the formulation. Moreover, the length
   parameter determined from one system can be readily applied to other
   systems, indicating the physical significance of the HLD-NAC model,
   which can to some extent predict the performance of one surfactant in
   various systems. The fitted length parameter for formulations with
   alcohol is underestimated because of this paper assuming all alcohol
   partition on the interface leading to overestimated interfacial area.
   The effect of cosolvent partitioning on the micelle structure and phase
   behavior modeling will be demonstrated in future studies.
   In this paper, the HLD-NAC equation of state is proved to be a simple
   and robust tool for modeling phase behavior of surfactant/crude
   oil/brine systems. The HLD-NAC model can shorten the surfactant
   screening process hence help chemical EOR formulation design and
   optimization, and can also be used in compositional chemical flooding
   reservoir simulation to improve the predictability of surfactant floods.

Abstract = {{An improved perturbation potential based panel method is applied to
   model the flow around ducted propellers. One significant development in
   this method is the application of full wake alignment scheme in which
   the trailing vortex wake sheets of the blades are aligned with the local
   flow velocity by also considering the effects of duct and duct wake. A
   process of repaneling the duct is simultaneously introduced to improve
   the accuracy of the method. The results from the improved wake model are
   compared with those from a simplified wake alignment scheme. At the same
   time, full-blown Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are
   conducted via commercial solvers. The forces, i.e., thrust and torque,
   on the propeller predicted by this panel method under the improved wake
   alignment model show good agreement both with experimental measurements,
   a hybrid method developed by the Ocean Engineering Group of University
   of Texas at Austin, and the full-blown RANS simulations. Moreover,
   predicted pressure distribution on the blades and duct are compared

Abstract = {{Consider a network of processes, where each process inputs a
   -dimensional vector of reals. All processes can communicate directly

   multidimensional Byzantine consensus problem, for synchronous systems,
   requires processes to decide on a single -dimensional vector , inside
   the convex hull of -dimensional vectors that were input by the
   non-faulty processes. Also, the multidimensional Byzantine approximate
   agreement (MBAA) problem, for asynchronous systems, requires processes
   to decide on multiple -dimensional vectors in , all within a fixed
   Euclidean distance of each other, and inside the convex hull of
   -dimensional vectors that were input by the non-faulty processes. We
   obtain the following results for the problems above, while tolerating up
   to Byzantine failures in systems with complete communication graphs: (1)
   In synchronous systems, is necessary and sufficient to solve the
   multidimensional consensus problem. (2) In asynchronous systems, is
   necessary and sufficient to solve the multidimensional approximate
   agreement problem. Our sufficiency proofs are constructive, giving
   explicit protocols for the problems. In particular, for the MBAA
   problem, we give two protocols with strictly different properties and

Abstract = {{A sparse nonnegative matrix factorization method with the thresholded
   ground distance (SNMF-TEMD) is proposed to solve the band selection
   problem in hyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification. The SNMF-TEMD
   assumes that band vectors are sampled from a union of low-dimensional
   subspaces and approximates a HSI data matrix with the product of a basis
   matrix constructed from subspaces and a sparse coefficient matrix. The
   SNMF-TEMD utilizes the TEMD metric to better measures approximation
   errors during the optimization of HSI data factorization. The TEMD
   metric makes up the theoretical drawbacks in the Euclidean distance (ED)
   and Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) metrics when measuring the
   approximation errors in HSI datasets. The SNMF-TEMD is solved by the
   combination of min-cost-flow algorithm and multiplicative update rules.
   The band cluster assignments are found according to positions of largest
   entries in columns of the coefficient matrix and the desired band subset
   constitutes with the bands closest to their cluster centers. Three
   groups of experiments on two HSI datasets are performed to explore the
   performance of SNMF-TEMD. Four popular band selection methods are used
   to make comparisons: affinity propagation (AP), maximum-variance
   principal component analysis (MVPCA), SNMF with ED metric (SNMF-ED) and
   SNMF with KLD metric (SNMF-KLD). Experimental results show that
   SNMF-TEMD outperforms all four methods in classification accuracy and
   its computational speed is slower than SNMF-ED and SNMF-KLD. SNMF-TEMD
   is a better choice for band selection among all five methods because of
   its overwhelming advantage in classification and the popular speed
   remedy scheme from parallel computing and high-performance computers.}},

   bright spots within the most superficial 250 mu m of the vessel wall was
   measured at the site of culprit lesion. Bright spot density in the
   culprit lesion was significantly higher in patients presenting with ACS
   compared to those presenting with SAP (0.51 +/- 0.43 \% vs. 0.37 +/-
   0.26 \%, P = 0.04), particularly in the subgroup with ruptured culprit
   plaque (0.59 +/- 0.52 \%). Thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) was associated
   with a trend towards a higher density of bright spots compared to
   non-TCFA plaques (0.57 +/- 0.50 \% vs. 0.41 +/- 0.31 \%, P = 0.08).
   Similar results were also obtained within 1000 mu m depth. Positive
   linear correlation was demonstrated between bright spot density and
   hsCRP level (r = 0.45, P = 0.002). Using a novel algorithm, we
   demonstrated a significantly higher density of bright spots in the
   culprit lesions of patients presenting with ACS, particularly in case of
   plaque rupture, compared to those presenting with SAP. The density of
   bright spots also correlates with inflammatory status. These results
   suggest that the quantitative assessment of bright spot density may be
   useful in evaluating plaque vulnerability.}},

Title = {{Improving Accuracy in Arrhenius Models of Cell Death: Adding a
   Temperature-Dependent Time Delay}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Arrhenius formulation for single-step irreversible unimolecular
   reactions has been used for many decades to describe the thermal damage
   and cell death processes. Arrhenius predictions are acceptably accurate
   for structural proteins, for some cell death assays, and for cell death
   at higher temperatures in most cell lines, above about 55 degrees C.
   However, in many cases-and particularly at hyperthermic temperatures,
   between about 43 and 55 degrees C-the particular intrinsic cell death or
   damage process under study exhibits a significant ``shoulder{''} region
   that constant-rate Arrhenius models are unable to represent with
   acceptable accuracy. The primary limitation is that Arrhenius
   calculations always overestimate the cell death fraction, which leads to
   severely overoptimistic predictions of heating effectiveness in tumor
   treatment. Several more sophisticated mathematical model approaches have
   been suggested and show much-improved performance. But simpler models
   that have adequate accuracy would provide useful and practical
   alternatives to intricate biochemical analyses. Typical transient
   intrinsic cell death processes at hyperthermic temperatures consist of a
   slowly developing shoulder region followed by an essentially
   constant-rate region. The shoulder regions have been demonstrated to
   arise chiefly from complex functional protein signaling cascades that
   generate delays in the onset of the constant-rate region, but may
   involve heat shock protein activity as well. This paper shows that
   acceptably accurate and much-improved predictions in the simpler
   Arrhenius models can be obtained by adding a temperature-dependent time
   delay. Kinetic coefficients and the appropriate time delay are obtained
   from the constant-rate regions of the measured survival curves. The
   resulting predictions are seen to provide acceptably accurate results
   while not overestimating cell death. The method can be relatively easily
   incorporated into numerical models. Additionally, evidence is presented
   to support the application of compensation law behavior to the cell
   death processes-that is, the strong correlation between the kinetic
   coefficients, ln\{A\} and E-a, is confirmed.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Numerical techniques commonly used to compute the dynamic response of
   soil deposits under earthquake shaking are investigated by analyzing
   data from instrumented borehole arrays. Eleven instrumented vertical
   arrays are investigated using over 650 recorded ground motions that span
   a range of shaking intensities. Based on data from the selected borehole
   arrays, site response predictions using one-dimensional equivalent
   linear (EQL) analysis, equivalent linear analysis with
   frequency-dependent soil properties (EQL-FD), and fully nonlinear (NL)
   analysis are compared with the borehole observations. The results across
   all sites indicate that at peak shear strains less than about 0.1\%, all
   three site response techniques predict, on average, site amplification
   within +/- 20\% of observed. At peak shear strains larger than 0.1\% and
   at periods less than about 0.4 s, EQL and NL analyses underpredict site
   amplification and EQL-FD analyses overpredict site amplification. The
   underprediction for the EQL and NL techniques may be as large as 70-75\%
   when the shear strength is not considered in the assignment of the shear
   modulus reduction curve, and the underprediction may still be as large
   as 55-65\% when the shear strength is considered. Over the same period
   range, EQL-FD analysis overpredicts site amplification by as much as
   75\% at shear strains larger than 0.1\%. These results indicate that
   one-dimensional site response techniques do not accurately predict site
   amplification at shorter periods and large strains. (C) 2015 American

Title = {{Parametric Analysis of Factors That Affect Asphalt Binder Foaming
   Characteristics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of foamed asphalt binder to produce warm-mix asphalt has
   increased significantly during the past few years. It is recognized that
   (1) foaming characteristics of the binder influence the workability of
   the asphalt mix, and (2) different asphalt binders tend to foam
   differently with all other factors being the same. The causes for the
   latter are relatively less explored and is the focus of this paper. The
   research reproted in this paper investigated the influence of the
   properties of asphalt binder on its foaming characteristics. A physical
   model for expansion of asphalt binder foam based on foam physics was
   used to quantify the effect of water content, temperature, surface
   tension, and liquid additive (through its effect on surface tension) on
   the expansion ratio of asphalt binder foam. Analysis of results
   demonstrates that the bubble size distribution (up to a certain limit)
   does not directly dictate the maximum expansion ratio of the asphalt
   binder foam. The analysis also shows that only a fraction of the water
   added to the binder is effective in creating the foam. The effective
   water content was strongly correlated with the surface tension of the
   binder, which was also substantiated by the solubility theory. Surface
   tension of the asphalt binder was also found to be strongly correlated
   to the stability of the foam. Foam characteristics of binders modified
   with additives also demonstrated that stability and expansion of foams
   can be significantly improved using carefully selected liquid additives.

Abstract = {{OBJECT Cerebral shunt malfunction is common but often difficult to
   effectively diagnose. Current methods-are invasive, involve ionizing
   radiation, and can be costly. The authors of this study investigated the
   feasibility of quantitatively measuring CSF flow in a shunt catheter
   using contrast-enhanced ultrasound.
   METHODS A syringe pump was used to push a solution of gas-filled
   microbubbles at specific flow rates through a shunt catheter while a
   high-frequency ultrasound imaging system was used to collect ultrasound
   images for off-line processing. Displacement maps and velocity profiles
   were generated using a speckle-tracking method based on a
   cross-correlation algorithm. An additional correction factor, to account
   for a predictable underestimation and to adjust the measured flow rates,
   was calculated based on the geometry of the ultrasound imaging plane and
   assuming a simple model of laminar flow.
   RESULTS The developed method was able to differentiate between
   physiologically relevant flow rates, including no flow and 0.006 to 0.09
   ml/min, with reasonable certainty. The quantitative measurement of flow
   rates through the catheter using this method was determined to be in
   good agreement with the expected flow rate.
   CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that contrast-enhanced ultrasound
   has the potential to be used as a minimally invasive and cost-effective
   alternative method for outpatient shunt malfunction diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for nonlinear analysis of RC slabs and shell structures is

   adequacy of the procedure is verified using test data of RC members

Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{490-505}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The ability of artificial immune systems to adapt to varying pathogens
   makes such systems a suitable choice for various robotic applications.
   Generally, immunity-based robotic applications map local instantaneous
   sensory information into either an antigen or a co-stimulatory signal,
   according to the choice of representation schema. Algorithms then use
   relevant immune functions to output either evolved antibodies or
   maturity of dendritic cells, in terms of actuation signals. It is
   observed that researchers do not try to replicate the biological
   immunity but select necessary immune functions instead, resulting in an
   ad-hoc manner these applications are reported. On the other hand, the
   paradigm shift in robotics research from reactive to probabilistic
   approaches is also not being reflected in these applications. Authors,
   therefore, present a detailed review of immuno-inspired robotic
   applications in an attempt to identify the possible areas to explore.
   Moreover, the literature has been categorized according to the
   underlying immuno-definitions. Implementation details have been
   critically reviewed in terms of corresponding mathematical expressions
   and their representation schema that include binary, real or hybrid
   approaches. Limitations of reported applications have also been
   identified in light of modern immunological interpretations including
   the danger theory. As a result of this study, authors suggest a renewed
   focus on innate immunity, action contextualization prior to B/T cell
   invocation and behavior evolution instead of arbitration. In this
   context, a multi-tier immunological framework for robotics research,
   combining innate and adaptive components together is also suggested and
   skeletonized. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Semisubmersible floating platforms used in offshore deep or ultradeep
   water environments have hull structures that are comprised of vertical
   cylinders (columns) connected by braces, pontoons, etc. Several of the
   connections between these various members are susceptible to fatigue
   damage. In fatigue damage assessment or fatigue reliability analysis, a
   global structural response analysis is typically carried out using a
   finite element (FE) model where internal forces or stresses in the
   various members are evaluated for specified sea states measured at the

   reliability analysis of brace-column connection details in a

Abstract = {{We describe an optimization model for interdicting smuggling of illicit
   nuclear material. Modeled on a directed network, the interdictor's goal
   is to select radiation detector installation locations, subject to a
   budget constraint, to minimize a smuggler's evasion probability. A
   smuggler, characterized by a random origin-destination pair, traverses
   the network knowing the detector locations. An additional layer of
   uncertainty is captured when considering a set of budget scenarios in
   place of a fixed budget value. An optimal solution to this model yields
   a priority list of detector installation locations. After the budget is
   revealed, detectors are installed from highest to lowest priority until
   the budget is exhausted. This notion captures time-phased securing of a
   transportation network as resources become available. Modeled as bilevel
   stochastic mixed-integer programs, both the fixed and random budget
   models are computationally challenging. Hence, we develop a tabu search
   heuristic to approximately solve both problem types, and we present
   computational results to assess the performance of our algorithm.}},

Title = {{Mechanical design of negative stiffness honeycomb materials}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATING MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING INNOVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A mechanical system exhibits negative stiffness when it requires a
   decrease in applied force to generate an increase in displacement.
   Negative stiffness behavior has been of interest for use in
   vibro-acoustic damping materials, vibration isolation mechanisms, and
   mechanical switches. This non-intuitive mechanical response can be
   elicited by transversely loading a curved beam structure of appropriate
   geometry, which can be designed to exhibit either one or two stable
   positions. The current work investigates honeycomb structures whose unit
   cells are created from curved beam structures that are designed to
   provide negative stiffness behavior and a single stable position. These
   characteristics allow the honeycomb to absorb large amounts of
   mechanical energy at a stable plateau stress, much like traditional
   honeycombs. Unlike traditional honeycombs, however, the mechanism
   underlying energy-absorbing behavior is elastic buckling rather than
   plastic deformation, which allows the negative stiffness honeycombs to
   recover from large deformations. Accordingly, they are compelling
   candidates for applications that require dissipation of multiple
   impacts. A detailed exploration of the unit cell design shows that
   negative stiffness honeycombs can be designed to dissipate mechanical
   energy in quantities that are comparable to traditional honeycomb
   structures at low relative densities. Furthermore, their unique cell
   geometry allows the designer to perform trade-offs between density,
   stress thresholds, and energy absorption capabilities. This paper
   describes these trade-offs and the underlying analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion of prestressed concrete structures is one of the main

   this paper presents the results of a long-term project that aims at
   developing a structural health monitoring (SHM) technology for the
   nondestructive evaluation of prestressed structures. In this paper, the
   use of permanently installed low profile piezoelectric transducers (PZT)
   is proposed in order to record the acoustic emissions (AE) along the
   length of the strand. The results of an accelerated corrosion test are
   presented and k-means clustering is applied via principal component
   analysis (PCA) of AE features to provide an accurate diagnosis of the
   strand health. The proposed approach shows good correlation between
   acoustic emissions features and strand failure. Moreover, a clustering
   technique for the identification of false alarms is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a new continuum mechanics modeling framework for liquid-vapor
   flows, with particular focus on the van der Waals fluid. By invoking
   microforce theory, the Coleman-Noll procedure is generalized to derive
   consistent constitutive relations in the presence of non-local effects.
   A new thermodynamically consistent algorithm for the van der Waals model
   is designed, using functional entropy variables and a new temporal
   scheme employing a family of new quadrature rules. We show that the
   resulting fully discrete scheme is unconditionally stable in entropy and
   second-order time-accurate. Isogeometric analysis is utilized for
   spatial discretization. The analytical properties of the formulation are
   corroborated by benchmark problems. Three sets of application problems
   are simulated to demonstrate the capability of the model and the
   algorithm. Our methodology provides a particularly useful predictive
   tool for boiling flows. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of production management and process control decisions
   is critical for improving economic performance of the chemical supply
   chain. A novel framework for integrating production scheduling and model
   predictive control (MPC) for continuous processes is proposed. Our
   framework is predicated on using a low-dimensional time scale-bridging
   model (SBM) that captures the closed-loop process dynamics over the
   longer time scales that are relevant to scheduling calculations. The SBM
   is used as a constraint in a mixed-integer dynamic formulation of the
   scheduling problem. To synchronize the scheduling and MPC calculations,
   a novel scheduling-oriented MPC concept is proposed, whereby the SBM is
   incorporated in the expression of the controller as a (soft) dynamic
   constraint and allows for obtaining an explicit description of the
   closed-loop process dynamics. Our framework scales favorably with system
   size and provides desirable closed-loop stability and performance
   properties for the resulting integrated scheduling and control problem.

Abstract = {{We study a dynamic scheduling problem for a multi-class queueing network
   with a large pool of statistically identical servers. The arrival
   processes are Poisson, and service times and patience times are assumed
   to be exponentially distributed and class dependent. The optimization
   criterion is the expected long time average (ergodic) of a general
   (nonlinear) running cost function of the queue lengths. We consider this
   control problem in the Halfin-Whitt (QED) regime, that is, the number of
   servers n and the total offered load r scale like n approximate to r +
   (rho) over cap root r for some constant (rho) over cap. This problem was
   proposed in {[}Ann. Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 1084-1134, Section 5.2].
   The optimal solution of this control problem can be approximated by that
   of the corresponding ergodic diffusion control problem in the limit. We
   introduce a broad class of ergodic control problems for controlled
   diffusions, which includes a large class of queueing models in the
   diffusion approximation, and establish a complete characterization of
   optimality via the study of the associated HJB equation. We also prove
   the asymptotic convergence of the values for the multi-class queueing
   control problem to the value of the associated ergodic diffusion control
   problem. The proof relies on an approximation method by spatial
   truncation for the ergodic control of diffusion processes, where the
   Markov policies follow a fixed priority policy outside a fixed compact
   set.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Markov chain based approach for the probabilistic
   density control of a large number, swarm, of autonomous agents. The
   proposed approach specifies the time evolution of the probabilistic
   density distribution by using a Markov chain, which guides the swarm to
   a desired steady-state distribution, while satisfying the prescribed
   ergodicity, motion, and safety constraints. This paper generalizes our
   previous results on density upper bound constraints and captures a
   general class of linear safety constraints that bound the flow of
   agents. The safety constraints are formulated as equivalent linear
   inequality conditions on the Markov chain matrices by using the duality
   theory of convex optimization which is our first contribution. With the
   safety constraints, we can facilitate proper low-level conflict
   avoidance policies to compute and execute the detailed agent state
   trajectories. Our second contribution is to develop (i) linear matrix
   inequality based offline methods, and (ii) quadratic programming based
   online methods that can incorporate these constraints into the Markov
   chain synthesis. The offline method provides a feasible solution for
   Markov matrix when there is no density feedback. The online method
   utilizes realtime estimates of the swarm density distribution to
   continuously update the Markov matrices to maximize the convergence
   rates within the problem constraints. The paper also introduces a
   decentralized method to compute the density estimates needed for the
   online synthesis method.}},

Abstract = {{Compartment fire behaviour under ceiling ventilation was experimentally
   investigated in a reduced-scale compartment. Different fuels, including
   methane, propane, N-heptane, ethanol and N-butanol, covering both gas
   and liquid phase fuels were used in the experiments. Measurements
   included gas fuel flow rate, pool fire Mass Loss Rate, gas temperature,
   and gas mole fraction. The fire development processes in ceiling vented
   compartments were described using energy and species balances. The
   influence of both the vent size and the fire size on energy and species
   transfer was examined. A ventilation limited extinction boundary was
   found for ceiling vented compartments and the general self-extinction
   processes were represented. The experimental results were plotted using
   a ventilation parameter (A(v)(5/4)/(Q) over dot(f)) derived from balance
   equations. It was found that this parameter can be used to identify the
   general ventilation condition in ceiling vented compartments. The oxygen
   concentration and gas temperature were shown to depend on the
   ventilation parameter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BUILDING SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{673-688}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thermal energy stores, when used as part of a demand management system,
   can shift peak cooling loads to off-peak hours or to periods when
   intermittent renewable energy sources are available. This enables more
   efficient use of baseline and renewable electric capacity, and reduces
   dependence on less efficient and more costly peak energy power plants.
   High density thermal stores can be an effective retrofit option for
   existing buildings and environmental control systems. This paper
   investigates the development of a simple, compact, high density thermal
   storage unit suitable for use in small to medium residential or
   commercial applications that utilize, or can be retrofitted to use,
   chilled water cooling coils. This thermal store design is based on the
   use of a widely available phase change material (PCM),
   macro-encapsulated into cylindrical tubes that are packed into a
   containment tank. An experimental scale model of this thermal store is
   constructed for test purposes, and tests are conducted to determine the
   feasibility of this design and to characterize its operation. A numeric
   model is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling such a
   store using simplified assumptions, both for design purposes and
   real-time predictive control strategies. The results show that such a
   design increases thermal capacity over that of a simple chilled water
   tank, and that a simplified numeric model for use by control systems can
   predict the short-term performance of the store in near real-time.}},

Abstract = {{We design, fabricate, and experimentally demonstrate a compact
   thermo-optic gate switch comprising a 3.78 mu m-long coupled L0-type
   photonic crystal microcavities on a silicon-on-insulator substrate. A

   crystal microcavity. Coupling between identical microcavities gives rise
   to bonding and anti-bonding states of the coupled photonic molecules.
   The coupled photonic crystal microcavities are numerically simulated and
   experimentally verified with a 6 nm-wide flat-bottom resonance in its
   transmission spectrum, which enables wider operational spectrum range
   than microring resonators. An integrated micro-heater is in direct
   contact with the silicon core to efficiently drive the device. The

   dB, an on-off switching power of 18.2 mW, a thermo-optic tuning
   efficiency of 0.63 nm/mW, a rise time of 14.8 mu s, and a fall time of

Number = {{6264}},
Pages = {{1069-1072}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Deep geological storage sites for nuclear waste are commonly located in
   rock salt to ensure hydrological isolation from groundwater. The low
   permeability of static rock salt is due to a percolation threshold.
   However, deformation may be able to overcome this threshold and allow
   fluid flow. We confirm the percolation threshold in static experiments
   on synthetic salt samples with x-ray microtomography. We then analyze
   wells penetrating salt deposits in the Gulf of Mexico. The observed
   hydrocarbon distributions in rock salt require that percolation occurred
   at porosities considerably below the static threshold due to
   deformation-assisted percolation. Therefore, the design of nuclear waste
   repositories in salt should guard against deformation-driven fluid
   percolation. In general, static percolation thresholds may not always
   limit fluid flow in deforming environments.}},

Abstract = {{A liquid junction photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar cell based on p-type
   methylammonium lead iodide (p-MeNH3PbI3) perovskite with a large

   soluble or decomposed in many common solvents. However, the solvent
   dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) can be employed to form stable liquid
   junctions. These were characterized with photoelectrochemical cells with
   several redox couples, including I-3(-)/I-, Fc/Fc(+), DMFc/DMFc(+), and
   BQ/BQ(center dot-) (where Fc is ferrocene, DMFc is decamethylferrocene,
   BQ is benzoquinone) in CH2Cl2. The solution-processed MeNH3PbI3 shows
   cathodic photocurrents and hence p-type behavior. The difference between
   the photocurrent onset potential and the standard potential for
   BQ/BQ(center dot-) is 1.25 V, which is especially large for a
   semiconductor with a band gap of 1.55 eV. A PEC photovoltaic cell, with
   a configuration of p-MeNH3PbI3/CH2Cl2, BQ (2 mM), BQ(center dot-) (2
   mM)/carbon, shows an open-circuit photovoltage of 1.05 V and a
   short-circuit current density of 7.8 mA/cm(2) under 100 mW/cm(2)

   efficiency is 6.1\%. The PEC solar cell shows good stability for 5 h

Title = {{Sub-micron Polymer-Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Layered Hybrids via

Abstract = {{Here we show that sub-micron coatings of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks
   (ZIFs) and even ZIF-ZIF bilayers can be grown directly on polymers of
   intrinsic microporosity from zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystal precursor
   films, yielding a new class of all-microporous layered hybrids. The
   ZnO-to-ZIF chemical transformation proceeded in less than 30 min under
   microwave conditions using a solution of the imidazole ligand in
   N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), water, or mixtures thereof. By varying the
   ratio of DMF to water, it was possible to control the morphology of the
   ZIF-on-polymer from isolated crystallites to continuous films. Grazing
   incidence X-ray diffraction was used to confirm the presence of
   crystalline ZIF in the thin films, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy was
   used to quantify film purity, revealing films with little to no residual
   ZnO. The role solvent plays in the transformation mechanism is discussed
   in light of these findings, which suggest the ZnO nanocrystals may be
   necessary to localize heterogeneous nucleation of the ZIF to the polymer
   surface.}},

   obtained has been studied in lithium-ion cells. A bond valence sum map
   has been performed to understand the ionic diffusion of lithium ions in

Abstract = {{To formalize our understanding of indiscriminate grafting chemistries as
   they pertain to cross-linkable polymers and emerging patterning
   technologies, we designed a new polymer, poly(styrene
   sulfonyl.azide-alt-maleic anhydride) (PSSMA). By modulating its
   solubility, it can be deposited into smooth, ultrathin films atop polar
   and nonpolar polymers. Upon heating above 120 degrees C or exposure to
   UV light, highly reactive nitrene intermediates are generated from the
   azide groups which form covalent adducts and cross-link the PSSMA. Azide
   photolysis and polymer gelation were studied in the context of a
   statistical model to gain insight into the network outcomes of nitrenes
   in a polymer film. For every azide group converted to a nitrene in
   ambient atmosphere, it has an 11\% likelihood of grafting to another
   chain and a 5\% chance of causing a scission. These values can be
   increased over 3-fold by reducing the O-2 content by 85\%.
   Alternatively, the effects of quenching by ground-state O-2 can be
   mitigated by adding Michler's ketone (MK) to the film. PSSMA/MK blend
   films possess a 39\% (+/- 13) likelihood for grafting and 29\% (+/- 10)
   for scission. The higher ratio of scission to grafting is a consequence
   of the sensitized azides producing triplet-state nitrenes, which favor
   hydrogen abstraction. These broadly generalizable considerations will be
   useful to others who wish to maximize light sensitivity in related
   polymer systems.}},

Abstract = {{Instructive biomaterials capable of controlling the behaviour of the
   cells are particularly interesting scaffolds for tissue engineering and
   regenerative medicine. Novel biomaterials are particularly important in
   societies with rapidly aging populations, where demand for organ/tissue
   donations is greater than their supply. Herein we describe the
   preparation of electrically conductive silk film-based nerve tissue
   scaffolds that are manufactured using all aqueous processing. Aqueous
   solutions of Bombyx mori silk were cast on flexible polydimethylsiloxane
   substrates with micrometer-scale grooves on their surfaces, allowed to
   dry, and annealed to impart -sheets to the silk which assures that the
   materials are stable for further processing in water. The silk films
   were rendered conductive by generating an interpenetrating network of
   polypyrrole and polystyrenesulfonate in the silk matrix. Films were
   incubated in an aqueous solution of pyrrole (monomer),
   polystyrenesulfonate (dopant) and iron chloride (initiator), after which
   they were thoroughly washed to remove low molecular weight components
   (monomers, initiators, and oligomers) and dried, yielding conductive
   films with sheet resistances of 124 +/- 23ksquare(-1). The
   micrometer-scale grooves that are present on the surface of the films
   are analogous to the natural topography in the extracellular matrix of
   various tissues (bone, muscle, nerve, skin) to which cells respond.
   Dorsal root ganglions (DRG) adhere to the films and the grooves in the
   surface of the films instruct the aligned growth of processes extending
   from the DRG. Such materials potentially enable the electrical
   stimulation (ES) of cells cultured on them, and future in vitro studies
   will focus on understanding the interplay between electrical and
   topographical cues on the behaviour of cells cultured on them.}},

Abstract = {{We employ an extension of the single chain in mean field simulation
   method to study mixtures of charged particles and uncharged polymers. We
   examine the effect of particle charge, polymer concentration, and
   particle volume fraction on the resulting particle aggregates. The
   structures of aggregates were characterized using particle particle
   radial distribution functions and cluster size distributions. We observe
   that the level of aggregation between particles increases with
   increasing particle volume fraction and polymer concentration and
   decreasing particle charge. At intermediate regimes of particle volume.
   fraction and polymer concentrations, we observe the formation of
   equilibrium clusters with a preferred size. We also examined the
   influence of manybody effects on the structure of a charged particle
   polymer system. Our results indicate that the effective two-body
   approximation overpredicts the aggregation between particles even at
   dilute particle concentrations. Such effects are thought to be a
   consequence of the interplay between the respective manybody effects on
   the depletion and electrostatic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze and model the nonlocal response of ultrathin hyperbolic
   metasurfaces (HMTSs) by applying an effective medium approach. We show
   that the intrinsic spatial dispersion in the materials employed to
   realize the metasurfaces imposes a wavenumber cutoff on the hyperbolic
   isofrequency contour, inversely proportional to the Fermi velocity, and
   we compare it with the cutoff arising from the structure granularity. In
   the particular case of HTMSs implemented by an array of graphene
   nanostrips, we find that graphene nonlocality can become the dominant
   mechanism that closes the hyperbolic contour - imposing a wavenumber
   cutoff at around 300k(0) - in realistic configurations with periodicity
   L<pi/(300k(0)), thus providing a practical design rule to implement
   HMTSs at THz and infrared frequencies. In contrast, more common
   plasmonic materials, such as noble metals, operate at much higher
   frequencies, and therefore their intrinsic nonlocal response is mainly
   relevant in hyperbolic metasurfaces and metamaterials with periodicity
   below a few nm, being very weak in practical scenarios. In addition, we
   investigate how spatial dispersion affects the spontaneous emission rate
   of emitters located close to HMTSs. Our results establish an upper bound
   set by nonlocality to the maximum field confinement and light-matter
   interactions achievable in practical HMTSs, and may find application in
   the practical development of hyperlenses, sensors and on-chip networks.

Abstract = {{Arginase deficiency is caused by deficiency of arginase 1 (ARG1), a urea
   cycle enzyme that converts arginine to ornithine. Clinical features of
   arginase deficiency include elevated plasma arginine levels, spastic
   diplegia, intellectual disability, seizures and growth deficiency.
   Unlike other urea cycle disorders, recurrent hyperammonemia is typically
   less severe in this disorder. Normalization of plasma arginine levels is
   the consensus treatment goal, because elevations of arginine and its
   metabolites are suspected to contribute to the neurologic features.
   Using data from patients enrolled in a natural history study conducted
   by the Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium, we found that 97\% of plasma
   arginine levels in subjects with arginase deficiency were above the
   normal range despite conventional treatment. Recently,
   arginine-degrading enzymes have been used to deplete arginine as a
   therapeutic strategy in cancer. We tested whether one of these enzymes,
   a pegylated human recombinant arginase 1 (AEB1102), reduces plasma
   arginine in murine models of arginase deficiency. In neonatal and adult
   mice with arginase deficiency, AEB1102 reduced the plasma arginine after
   single and repeated doses. However, survival did not improve likely,
   because this pegylated enzyme does not enter hepatocytes and does not
   improve hyperammonemia that accounts for lethality. Although murine
   models required dosing every 48 h, studies in cynomolgus monkeys
   indicate that less frequent dosing may be possible in patients. Given
   that elevated plasma arginine rather than hyperammonemia is the major
   treatment challenge, we propose that AEB1102 may have therapeutic
   potential as an arginine-reducing agent in patients with arginase
   deficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin methodology with optimal test
   functions (DPG) of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan {[}18,20] guarantees the
   optimality of the solution in an energy norm, and provides several
   features facilitating adaptive schemes. Whereas Bubnov-Galerkin methods
   use identical trial and test spaces, Petrov-Galerkin methods allow these
   function spaces to differ. In DPG, test functions are computed on the
   fly and are chosen to realize the supremum in the inf-sup condition; the
   method is equivalent to a minimum residual method. For well-posed
   problems with sufficiently regular solutions, DPG can be shown to
   converge at optimal rates-the inf-sup constants governing the
   convergence are mesh-independent, and of the same order as those
   governing the continuous problem {[}48]. DPG also provides an accurate
   mechanism for measuring the error, and this can be used to drive
   adaptive mesh refinements.
   We employ DPG to solve the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
   in two dimensions, building on previous work on the Stokes equations,
   and focusing particularly on the usefulness of the approach for
   automatic adaptivity starting from a coarse mesh. We apply our approach
   to a manufactured solution due to Kovasznay as well as the lid-driven
   cavity flow, backward-facing step, and flow past a cylinder problems.

   fracturing and fluid loss in shale}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{549-559}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Pore diameter in shale strata ranges from a few to hundreds of
   nanometers, whereas in conventional reservoirs the range is 3 orders of
   magnitude greater. In spite of the small size of the pores-which would
   be expected to cause very low intrinsic permeability-field reports
   document unusually high loss of hydraulic fracturing fluid (as much as
   90\%) in shale reservoirs. The lost fluid remains in induced fractures
   and also leaks off into the shale matrix. Liquid flow in tiny pores is
   different from the flow in large pores. To compensate for this
   difference, the traditional liquid flow model needs a correction
   parameter called liquid slip length. We measured slip length of brine
   and pores in shale by using an atomic force microscope (AFM). Our
   measurements suggest a slip length of 250 nm in organic pores. We used
   measured slip length in a stochastic permeability model to calculate
   apparent liquid permeability (ALP) in the shale matrix. When corrected
   for slip length, the ALP in shale can be much greater than intrinsic
   Darcy permeability. We then used ALP in a coupled flow-geomechanical
   simulator to study the effects of slip-corrected matrix permeability on
   the induced fracture network and fluid loss during hydraulic fracturing.
   The results show the dramatic effects of the slip parameter on the
   fracture network and explain the high fluid loss during hydraulic
   fracturing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a computational study of the interactions,
   phase-behavior and aggregation characteristics of charged nanoparticles
   (CNPs) suspended in solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes
   (PEs). We used an extension of the mean-field polymer self-consistent
   field theory (SCFT) model presented in our earlier work (Macromolecules,
   2014, 47, 6095-6112) to explicitly characterize the multibody
   interactions in such systems. For dilute moderate particle volume
   fractions, the magnitudes of three and higher multibody interactions
   were seen to be weak relative to the contributions from pair
   interactions. On the basis of such results, we embeded the
   pair-interaction potentials within a thermodynamic perturbation theory
   approach to identify the phase behavior of such systems. The results of
   such a framework suggested that the gas and FCC crystal phases were
   thermodynamically stable, whereas the fluidlike phase was metastable in
   such systems. To complement the parameters studied using SCFT, we used a
   recently developed multibody simulation approach to study the
   aggregation and cluster morphologies in CNP-PE mixtures. For low
   particle charges, such systems mainly exhibited clusters arising from
   direct contact aggregation between CNPs. However, for higher particle
   and PE charges and low PE concentrations, large regions of PE-bridged
   clusters were seen to form. We present a morphological phase diagram
   summarizing such results.}},

Abstract = {{Manning's counterion condensation theory, originally developed for

   Equilibrium sodium and chloride ion concentrations in negatively and

   function of external NaCl concentration, and ion activity coefficients
   in the membranes were obtained via a thermodynamic treatment.
   Theoretical values for membrane ion activity coefficients obtained via
   Manning's model were compared with those obtained experimentally. Good
   agreement was observed between the experimental and theoretical values
   for membrane ion activity coefficients, especially at higher external
   NaCl concentrations. However, some deviation between experimental and
   theoretical values was observed in the dilute regime. Manning's model
   was also used to obtain activity coefficients for various electrolytes
   in ion exchange resins using ion sorption data from the literature, and
   these values were compared to those obtained experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Trichloroethylene (TCE) in groundwater has the potential to volatilize
   through soil into indoor air where it can be inhaled. The purpose of
   this study was to determine whether individuals living above
   TCE-contaminated groundwater are exposed to TCE through vapor intrusion.
   We examined associations between TCE concentrations in various
   environmental media and TCE concentrations in residents. For this
   assessment, indoor air, outdoor air, soil gas, and tap water samples
   were collected in and around 36 randomly selected homes; blood samples
   were collected from 63 residents of these homes. Additionally, a
   completed exposure survey was collected from each participant.
   Environmental and blood samples were analyzed for TCE. Mixed model
   multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine
   associations between TCE in residents' blood and TCE in indoor air,
   outdoor air, and soil gas. Blood TCE concentrations were above the limit
   of quantitation (LOQ; 0.012 mu g L-1) in 17.5\% of the blood samples. Of
   the 36 homes, 54.3\%, 47.2\%, and >84\% had detectable concentrations of
   TCE in indoor air, outdoor air, and soil gas, respectively. Both indoor
   air and soil gas concentrations were statistically significantly
   positively associated with participants' blood concentrations (P =
   0.0002 and P = 0.04, respectively). Geometric mean blood concentrations
   of residents from homes with indoor air concentrations of >1.6 mu g
   m(-3) were approximately 50times higher than geometric mean blood TCE
   concentrations in participants from homes with no detectable TCE in
   indoor air (P < .0001; 95\% CI 10.4-236.4). This study confirms the
   occurrence of vapor intrusion and demonstrates the magnitude of exposure
   from vapor intrusion of TCE in a residential setting.}},

   Buckle Delaminations}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{2D systems have great promise as next generation electronic materials
   but require intimate knowledge of their interactions with their
   neighbors for device fabrication and mechanical manipulation. Although
   adhesion between 2D materials and stiff substrates such as silicon and
   copper has been measured, adhesion between 2D materials and soft polymer
   substrates remains difficult to characterize due to the large
   deformability of the polymer substrates. In this work, a buckling-based
   metrology for measuring the adhesion energy between few layer molybdenum
   disulfide (MoS2) and soft elastomeric substrates is proposed and
   demonstrated. Due to large elastic mismatch, few layer MoS2 flakes can
   form spontaneous wrinkles and buckle-delaminations on elastomer
   substrates during exfoliation. MoS2-elastomer interface toughness can
   therefore be calculated from the buckle delamination profile measured by
   atomic force microscopy. The thickness of the MoS2 flake is obtained by
   analyzing coexisting wrinkles on the same flake. Using this approach,
   adhesion of few layer MoS2 to 10:1 Sylgard 184 polydimethylsiloxane is
   measured to be 18 +/- 2 mJ m(-2), which is about an order of magnitude
   below graphene-to-stiff-substrate adhesion. Finally, this simple
   methodology can be generalized to obtain adhesion energies between
   various combinations of 2D materials and deformable substrates.}},

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{A distributed replica dynamics (DRD) method is proposed to calculate
   rare-event molecular dynamics using distributed computational resources.
   Similar to Voter's parallel replica dynamics (PRD) method, the dynamics
   of independent replicas of the system are calculated on different
   computational clients. In DRD, each replica runs molecular dynamics from
   an initial state for a fixed simulation time and then reports
   information about the trajectory back to the server. A simulation clock
   on the server accumulates the simulation time of each replica until one
   reports a transition to a new state. Subsequent calculations are
   initiated from within this new state and the process is repeated to
   follow the state-to-state evolution of the system. DRD is designed to
   work with asynchronous and distributed computing resources in which the
   clients may not be able to communicate with each other. Additionally,
   clients can be added or removed from the simulation at any point in the
   calculation. Even with heterogeneous computing clients, we prove that
   the DRD method reproduces the correct probability distribution of escape
   times. We also show this correspondence numerically; molecular dynamics
   simulations of Al(100) adatom diffusion using PRD and DRD give
   consistent exponential distributions of escape times. Finally, we
   discuss guidelines for choosing the optimal number of replicas and
   replica trajectory length for the DRD method. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

   comparisons between the two routes showed that PHA cyclodehydration can
   produce fully converted PBO membranes at a temperature more than 100
   degrees C lower than the API-TR route. Gas separation performance of
   PHA-PBOs is comparable to API-TR polymers, and PHA-PBOs are considerably
   more mechanically robust. More importantly, PBO films can be produced
   equally well in both air and inert atmospheres via the PHA
   cyclodehydration route. The PHA-PBOs formed in air have statistically
   the same physical and transport properties as those formed in N-2. The
   present study provides fundamental information regarding the PHA-to-PBO

Abstract = {{Immunomagnetic assay has been developed to detect rare circulating tumor
   cells (CTCs), which shows clinical significance in cancer diagnosis and
   prognosis. The generation and fine-tuning of the magnetic field play
   essential roles in such assay toward effective single-cell-based
   analyses of target cells. However, the current assay has a limited range
   of field gradient, potentially leading to aggregation of cells and
   nanoparticles. Consequently, quenching of the fluorescence signal and
   mechanical damage to the cells may occur, which lower the system
   sensitivity and specificity. We develop a micromagnet-integrated
   microfluidic system for enhanced CTC detection. The ferromagnetic
   micromagnets, after being magnetized, generate localized magnetic field
   up to 8-fold stronger than that without the micromagnets, and strengthen
   the interactions between CTCs and the magnetic field. The system is
   demonstrated with four cancer cell lines with over 97\% capture rate, as
   well as with clinical samples from breast, prostate, lung, and
   colorectal cancer patients. The system captures target CTCs from patient
   blood samples on a standard glass slide that can be examined using the
   fluorescence in-situ hybridization method for the single-cell profiling.
   All cells showed clear hybridization signals, indicating the efficacy of
   the compact system in providing retrievable cells for molecular studies.}},

Title = {{Mechanism and Mitigation of the Decomposition of an Oxorhenium
   Complex-Based Heterogeneous Catalyst for Perchlorate Reduction in Water}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{12932-12940}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{A biomimetic heterogeneous catalyst combining palladium nanoparticles
   and an organic ligand-coordinated oxorhenium complex on activated
   carbon, Re(hoz)(2)-Pd/C, was previously developed and shown to reduce
   aqueous perchlorate (CIO4-) with H-2 at a rate, similar to 100 times
   faster than the first generation ReOx-Pd/C catalyst prepared from
   perrhenate (ReO4-). However, the immobilized Re(hoz)(2) complex was
   shown to partially decompose and leach into water as ReO4-, leading to
   an irreversible loss of catalytic activity. In this work, the stability
   of the immobilized Re(hoz)(2) complex is shown to depend on kinetic
   competition between three processes: (1) Re-V(hoz)(2) oxidation by CIO4-
   and its reduction intermediates CIOx-, (2) Re-VII(hoz)(2) reduction by
   Pd-activated hydrogen, and (3) hydrolytic Re-VII(hoz)(2) decomposition.
   When Re-V(hoz)(2) oxidation is faster than Re-VII(hoz)(2) reduction, the
   Re-VII(hoz)(2) concentration builds up and leads to hydrolytic
   decomposition to ReO4- and free hoz ligand. Rapid Rev(hoz)2 oxidation is
   mainly promoted by highly reactive ClOx- formed from the reduction of
   CIO4-. To mitigate Re(hoz)(2) decomposition and preserve catalytic
   activity, ruthenium (Ru) and rhodium (Rh) were evaluated as alternative
   H2 activators to Pd. Rh showed superior activity for reducing the CIO3-
   intermediate to CI-, thereby preventing CIOx- buildup and lowering Re
   complex decomposition in the Re(hoz)(2)-Rh/C catalyst. In contrast, Ru
   showed the lowest CIO3- reduction activity and resulted in the most
   Re(hoz)(2) decomposition among the Re(hoz)(2)-M/C catalysts. This work
   highlights the importance of using mechanistic insights from kinetic and
   spectroscopic tests to rationally design water treatment catalysts for
   enhanced performance and stability.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigated the effect of in-situ Ar ion plasma
   surface pre-treatment in order to improve the interface properties of
   In0.53Ga0.47As for high-kappa top-gate oxide deposition. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and metal-oxide-semiconductor
   capacitors (MOSCAPs) demonstrate that Ar ion treatment removes the
   native oxide on In0.53Ga0.47As. The XPS spectra of Ar treated
   In0.53Ga0.47As show a decrease in the AsOx and GaOx signal intensities,
   and the MOSCAPs show higher accumulation capacitance (C-acc), along with
   reduced frequency dispersion. In addition, Ar treatment is found to
   suppress the interface trap density (D-it), which thereby led to a
   reduction in the threshold voltage (V-th) degradation during constant
   voltage stress and relaxation. These results outline the potential of
   surface treatment for III-V channel metal-oxide-semiconductor devices
   and application to non-planar device process. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Title = {{A New Uncertainty Budgeting-Based Method for Robust Analog/Mixed-Signal
   Design}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article proposes a novel methodology for robust analog/mixed-signal
   IC design by introducing a notion of budget of uncertainty. This method
   employs a new conic uncertainty model to capture process variability and
   describes variability-affected circuit design as a set-based robust
   optimization problem. For a prespecified yield requirement, the proposed
   method conducts uncertainty budgeting by associating performance yield
   with the size of uncertainty set for process variations. Hence the
   uncertainty budgeting problem can be further translated into a tractable
   robust optimization problem. Compared with the existing robust design
   flow based on ellipsoid model, this method is able to produce more
   reliable design solutions by allowing varying size of conic uncertainty
   set at different design points. In addition, the proposed method
   addresses the limitation that the size of the ellipsoid model is
   calculated solely relying on the distribution of process parameters,
   while neglecting the dependence of circuit performance upon these design
   parameters. The proposed robust design framework has been verified on
   various analog/mixed-signal circuits to demonstrate its efficiency
   against the ellipsoid model. Up to 24\% reduction of design cost has
   been achieved by using the uncertainty budgeting-based method.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we present a pairwise coloring (PWC) approach to tackle
   the layout decomposition problem for triple patterning lithography
   (TPL). The main idea is to reduce the problem to a set of bi-coloring
   problems. The overall solution is refined by applying a bi-coloring
   method for pairs of color sets per pass. One obvious advantage of this
   method is that the existing double patterning lithography (DPL)
   techniques can be reused effortlessly. Moreover, we observe that each
   pass can be fulfilled efficiently by integrating an
   SPQR-tree-graph-division-based bi-coloring method. In addition, to
   prevent the solution getting stuck in the local minima, an adaptive
   multi-start (AMS) approach is incorporated. Adaptive starting points are
   generated according to the vote of previous solutions. The experimental
   results show that our method is competitive with other works on both
   solution quality and runtime performance.}},

Abstract = {{Na2Ti2O5 (NTO) nanowire arrays coated with VS2 nanosheets (NTO-VS2) have
   been directly prepared on a current collector as a 3D anode for Na-ion
   batteries. Compared to graphite, the larger interlayer spacing of two
   dimensional VS2 can offer facile intercalation of lithium and/or sodium
   ions. Aside from its natural metallic behavior, VS2 also possesses a
   high theoretical capacity. The composite NTO-VS2 nanowire arrays as an
   additive free 3D anode shows superior electrochemical performance
   compared to NTO. After 50 (C/10) and 100 (1C) cycles, the charge
   capacities of NTO-VS2 are maintained, respectively, at 298 and 203 mA h
   g(-1), which are much higher than the values of 157 and 93 mA h g(-1)
   observed for the same cycled Na2Ti2O5 electrodes. The higher capacity,
   improved rate capability, and good stability of the composite NTO-VS2
   nanowire arrays are due to the structural stability of the Na2Ti2O5
   nanowire arrays and the higher capacity and conductivity of the
   two-dimensional VS2 nanosheets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The diversity of engineering education research provides an opportunity
   for cross-fertilization of ideas and creativity, but it also can result
   in fragmentation of the field and duplication of effort. One solution is
   to establish a standardized taxonomy of engineering education terms to
   map the field and communicate and connect research initiatives. This
   report describes the process for developing such a taxonomy, the EER
   Taxonomy. Although the taxonomy focuses on engineering education
   research in the United States, inclusive efforts have engaged 266
   individuals from 149 cities in 30 countries during one multiday
   workshop, seven conference sessions, and several other virtual and
   in-person activities. The resulting taxonomy comprises 455 terms
   arranged in 14 branches and six levels. This taxonomy was found to
   satisfy four criteria for validity and reliability: (1) keywords
   assigned to a set of abstracts were reproducible by multiple
   researchers, (2) the taxonomy comprised terms that could be selected as
   keywords to fully describe 243 articles in three journals, (3) the
   keywords for those 243 articles were evenly distributed across the
   branches of the taxonomy, and (4) the authors of 31 conference papers
   agreed with 90\% of researcher-assigned keywords. This report also
   describes guidelines developed to help authors consistently assign
   keywords for their articles by encouraging them to choose terms from
   three categories: (1) context/focus/topic, (2)
   purpose/target/motivation, and (3) research approach.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Selective localization of biomolecules at the hot spots of a plasmonic
   nanoparticle is an attractive strategy to exploit the light-matter
   interaction due to the high field concentration. Current approaches for
   hot spot targeting are time-consuming and involve prior knowledge of the
   hot spots. Multiphoton plasmonic lithography is employed to rapidly
   immobilize bovine serum albumin (BSA) hydrogel at the hot spot tips of a
   single gold nanotriangle (AuNT). Regioselectivity and quantity control
   by manipulating the polarization and intensity of the incident laser are
   also established. Single AuNTs are tracked using dark-field scattering
   spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy to characterize the
   regioselective process. Fluorescence lifetime measurements further
   confirm BSA immobilization on the AuNTs. Here, the AuNT-BSA hydrogel
   complexes, in conjunction with single-particle optical monitoring, can
   act as a framework for understanding light-molecule interactions at the
   subnanoparticle level and has potential applications in biophotonics,
   nanomedicine, and life sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical conductivity is a fundamental characteristic describing how
   strongly a network opposes flow of electrical current. In fully
   water-saturated porous media the conductivity, represented by the
   formation factor, is mainly controlled by porosity, connectivity of the
   conducting phases, and the tortuosity of electrical current paths.
   Previous work has shown that universal scaling derived from percolation
   and effective medium theories accurately describes the relationship
   between formation factor and porosity when the percolation threshold is
   taken account, as well as the porosity value at which the scaling
   switches from percolation theory to effective medium theory. We
   determined the formation factor in clay-rich sediments based on cation
   exchange capacity measurements on samples from five scientific ocean
   drilling sites in the Nankai Trough. We then compared the results to
   predictions from universal scaling after determining the volume of
   clay-bound water and the percolation threshold. We found that the
   previously reported universal scaling relations hold in these clay-rich
   sediments once the corrections are made for the clay-bound water and
   that percolation scaling appears to be valid over the entire range of
   observed porosities, probably due to relatively broad pore size
   distributions or low pore system connectivity. Our results show that
   universal scaling can be applied to describe the porosity dependence of
   the formation factor in clay-rich sediments when appropriate corrections
   are made for the presence of clay-bound water.}},

Abstract = {{The naturally occurring radionuclides of U-235, U-238 and Th-232 and
   their daughter products are a potential major source of anthropogenic
   radiation to tobacco smokers. Often overlooked is the presence of K-40
   in tobacco and its implication to radiation dose accumulation in the
   human body. In this study, these three radiation sources have been
   determined in four typical US cigarettes using neutron activation
   analysis (NAA). The NAA reactions of U-238(n, g) U-239, Th-232(n, gamma)
   Th-233 and K-41(n, gamma) K-42 were used to determine U-235, U-238 and
   Th-232 and K-40, respectively. The activity of U-238 can easily be
   determined by epithermal NAA of the U-238(n, gamma) 239U reaction, and
   the activity of (235), (234)(U) can easily be deduced. Using isotopic
   ratios, the activity due to K-40 was found by the determined
   concentrations of K-41 (also by epithermal neutrons) in the bulk
   material. Each gram of total potassium yields 30 Bq of K-40. The annual
   effective dose for smokers using 20 cigarettes per day was calculate to
   be 14.6, 137 and 9 mu Sv y(-1) for U-238,U-235,U-234, Th-232 and K-40,

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the ability of ultrasonography (US)-guided
   spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging to depict changes in blood
   oxygen saturation (SO2) in metastatic lymph nodes of a mouse model of
   oral cancer.
   Materials and Methods: All studies were performed by following protocols
   approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the
   University of Texas at Austin. Coregistered US and photoacoustic images
   were acquired spanning volumes containing a total of 31 lymph nodes in
   17 female nu/nu mice. The mice were either healthy (three mice, five
   nodes) or bearing a primary tumor consisting of luciferase-labeled FaDu
   cells (14 mice, 26 nodes). Ten photoacoustic images acquired with
   optical wavelengths spanning from 680 to 860 nm were spectrally unmixed
   by using a linear least-squares method to obtain sPA images. After
   imaging, histologic analysis enabled confirmation of the presence of
   micrometastases. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare
   metastatic and normal lymph nodes, with a P value of .05 taken to
   indicate a significant difference. Sensitivity and specificity were
   determined with a receiver operator characteristic curve constructed
   from the background-subtracted SO2 values.
   Results: Metastatic lymph nodes (n = 7) exhibited a significantly (P =
   .018) lower spatially averaged background-subtracted SO2 (mean, 5.4\% 6
   3.5 {[}standard error]) when compared with lymph nodes without
   metastases (mean, 13.7\% 6 1.3; n = 24). This effect was observed
   throughout the entire volume of the nodes rather than being limited to
   the metastatic foci. The change in SO2, which was inversely related to
   the size of the metastasis, was detectable in metastases as small as 2.6

   Conclusion: The results show that US-guided sPA imaging is capable of
   depicting changes in SO2 in lymph nodes that were correlated with
   metastatic invasion. (C)RSNA, 2015}},

Abstract = {{Simulation and fluid flow prediction of many petroleum-enhanced oil
   recovery methods as well as environmental processes such as carbon
   dioxide (CO2) geological storage or underground water resources
   remediation requires accurate modeling and determination of relative
   permeability under different saturation histories. Based on this
   critical need, several three-phase relative permeability models were
   developed to predict relative permeability; however, for practical
   purposes most of them require a variety of parameters introducing
   undesired complexity to the models. In this work, we attempt to find out
   if there is a simpler way to express this functionality. To do so, we
   experimentally measure three-phase, water/oil/gas, relative permeability
   in a 1 m long water-wet sand pack, under several saturation flow paths
   to cover the entire three-phase saturation space. We obtain the in situ
   saturations along the sand pack using a CT scanner and then determine
   the relative permeabilities of liquid phases directly from the measured
   in situ saturations using an unsteady state method. The measured data
   show that at a specific saturation, the oil relative permeability varies
   significantly (up to two orders of magnitude), depending on the path
   through saturation space. The three-phase relative permeability data are
   modeled using standard relative permeability models, Corey-type, and
   Saturation Weighted Interpolation (SWI). Our measured data suggest that
   three-phase oil relative permeability in water-wet media is only a
   function of its own saturation if the residual oil saturation is treated
   as a function of two saturations. We determine that residual saturation
   is the key parameter in modeling three-phase relative permeability
   (effect of saturation history).}},

Abstract = {{Snap-off is an important dynamic multiphase flow phenomenon which occurs
   in porous media. It plays a dominant role in the residual trapping and
   mobilization/immobilization of nonwetting fluids such as hydrocarbons or
   CO2. Current studies, applications, and threshold criteria of snap-off
   are mostly based on static or equilibrium conditions. Thus, the dynamics
   of snap-off which is relevant for many real world applications has
   rarely been systematically studied. While a static criterion indicates
   the snap-off potential for nonwetting fluids, the competition between
   the time required for snap-off and the local pore throat capillary
   number determines whether snap-off actually occurs. Using a theoretical
   model to couple the wetting film thickness to the local capillary number
   at the pore throat, we analyzed the dynamics of the wetting/nonwetting
   interface instability in sinusoidally constricted capillary tubes. The
   influence of dynamic factors as encapsulated by the effect of local
   capillary number on nonwetting fluid snap-off time were investigated for
   varying pore throat to pore body aspect ratio and pore body distances.
   The analysis showed that snap-off can be inhibited by a sufficiently
   large local capillary number even in cases where the static snap-off
   criterion has been met.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy is a clean and renewable source for electricity generation.
   To reduce the costs associated with wind power generation, development
   of a control methodology that maximizes the wind energy capture and
   mitigates the turbine fatigue loading is desired. In this paper, a new
   adaptive gain modified optimal torque controller (AGMOTC) for wind
   turbine partial load operation is presented. A gain-scheduling technique
   with an internal proportional integral (PI) control is developed to
   accelerate the controller's convergence to a reference tip speed ratio
   (TSR). The reference TSR is then adjusted to its optimal value in
   real-time through an adaptive algorithm capable of rejecting model
   uncertainties and estimation errors of the control gain. A fatigue
   mitigation method is also designed to reduce the impact of exacerbated
   tower bending moments due to the resonance effect. The proposed AGMOTC
   is evaluated based on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
   5MW wind turbine model using the NREL FAST simulator. Simulation results
   have shown that the AGMOTC has improved efficiency and robustness in
   wind energy capture and reduced tower fatigue loading as compared to the
   traditional control technique.}},

Title = {{Early kick detection and well control decision-making for managed
   pressure drilling automation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{354-366}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Early kick detection and blowout prevention is a major concern in any
   drilling operation. Usually, conventional well control procedures rely
   merely on the pit gain and variations in pump pressure as the primary
   indicators to detect and handle a kick. These indicators are rudimentary
   and unreliable for drilling costly offshore wells while advanced well
   control techniques demand more reliable indicators for early detection
   of kicks. For instance, early kick detection plays a vital role in
   deploying Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) techniques successfully.
   Moreover, in conventional drilling, the only widely accepted response to
   a gas influx is to shut the well in on the BOPs. The Constant Bottom
   Hole Pressure (CBHP) variation of MPD allows for circulating small and
   medium-sized influxes out without the need to shut in the well, either
   by increasing casing back-pressure and/or by adjusting pump flow rate.
   Evident benefits include a faster response to the kick (with clear
   safety benefits) and a considerable time and cost savings compared to
   the conventional approach.
   Unfortunately, there is currently no method available to decide upon the
   best MPD-CBHP response during an influx, because such a response depends
   on many parameters, such as Maximum Allowable Surface Pressure (MASP),
   wellbore geometry, fracture pressure of any weak zones exposed in open
   hole, type of drilling fluid, influx size, etc. To remedy this
   situation, we present a fast and accurate decision-making method that
   overcomes the traditional difficulties and automatically selects a best
   well control response. The method incorporates a transient multi-phase
   model based on mass and momentum conservation. A numerical simulator was
   developed for this purpose. Comparing the actual well response with
   simulated results during an influx event and following the proposed
   algorithm allows the best response to be taken in a quick, convenient,
   and accurate manner. Moreover, the approach lends itself well to fully
   automated well control.
   Here, we describe the new method and its validation using available
   two-phase experimental data for annular air water and air-mud flow for a
   wide range of flow rates and flow regimes. We believe that the method
   provides a powerful new decision-making and design tool in MPD
   operations that ensures delivery of safer wells with lower
   non-productive time and associated trouble cost spent on well control
   operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Jilin Oilfield has been conducting a large-scale demonstration project
   on CO2 EOR and storage in China. CO2 separated from a nearby natural gas
   reservoir (15-30 vol\% CO2) has been injected into the northern part of
   H-59 oil block with the permeability of 3.0 mD and porosity of 12.7\%.
   After six years of operation, nearly 0.26 million ton of CO2 (032
   Hydrocarbon Pore Volume) has been injected under a miscible or
   near-miscible flooding mode with CO2 utilization efficiency of 63
   MScf/bbl, and an expected enhanced oil recovery of over 10\% would be
   achieved. A systematic and thorough reservoir surveillance program has
   been conducted to facilitate efficient operation and evaluation. Casing
   annulus gas composition was analyzed to monitor gas breakthrough in
   production wells. as well as the gas tracer to detect CO2 flow across
   the reservoir. Bottom hole pressure (BHP) survey of producers and fluid
   sampling were combined to evaluate the miscibility effect in conjunction
   with the injection-production data analysis. It is revealed that the
   designed miscible flooding is best described as near-miscible due to the
   large pressure difference between injector and producer, and the gas
   channeling and fractures/heterogeneities cause the miscibility
   instability. Gravity-stabilized displacement may develop in the downdip
   part of the reservoir during the flooding process. The vaporization and
   condensation effects have been observed and confirmed through laboratory
   core flooding and field produced oil compositions analysis. A key
   insight from the evaluation study is that CO2 near-miscible flooding is
   more flexible and easily realizable relative to miscible, particularly
   in the tight oil reservoir. Further study would be necessary to optimize
   the reservoir development program under the near-miscible flooding
   design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically and experimentally explore the use of mantle covers to
   cloak dipole antennas and reduce their blockage on nearby antennas. The
   proposed structures allow reducing the observability in a given
   frequency range and overall scattering of conventional dipole antennas
   operating in a different frequency band, ideally suited to reduce the
   mutual influence among antennas placed in close proximity to each other.
   We prove this concept in the case of a low-band (LB) dipole antenna
   placed in close proximity to a high-band dipole antenna, and study
   several thin cover designs that are shown to be effective in reducing
   the LB blockage, without disrupting the performance of both antennas in
   terms of radiation pattern and impedance matching. An optimized cover is
   proposed to strongly reduce the interference and shadowing over a large
   bandwidth targeted for one polarization, and we also experimentally
   demonstrate the operation of dual-polarized covers for near-field horn
   and log-periodic antenna excitation.}},

Abstract = {{We study the influence of motion on the visibility of flicker
   distortions in naturalistic videos. A series of human subjective studies
   were executed to understand how motion silences the visibility of
   flicker distortions as a function of object motion, flicker frequency,
   and video quality. We found that flicker visibility is strongly reduced
   when the speed of coherent motion is large, and the effect is pronounced
   when video quality is poor. Based on this finding, we propose a model of
   flicker visibility on naturalistic videos. The target-related activation
   levels in the excitatory layer of neurons were estimated for a displayed
   video using a spatiotemporal backward masking model, and then the
   flicker visibility is predicted based on a learned model of neural
   flicker adaptation processes. Experimental results show that the
   prediction of flicker visibility using the proposed model correlates
   well with human perception of flicker distortions. We believe that
   sufficiently fast and coherent motion silences the perception of flicker
   distortions on naturalistic videos in agreement with a recently observed
   ``motion silencing{''} effect on synthetic stimuli. We envision that the
   proposed model could be applied to develop perceptual video quality
   assessment algorithms that can predict ``silenced{''} temporal
   distortions and account for them when computing quality judgments. (C)

Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{124-131}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an economic analysis of the absorber for a 250 MW
   coal-fired power plant was conducted. The purpose of the research is to
   determine the optimal design and operating conditions for the amine
   scrubbing post-combustion absorber. The Energy Cost (Energy) and the
   Annualized Capital Cost (CAPEX) for the absorber were calculated to
   determine the total processing cost as a function of the gas superficial
   velocity (u(G)). To calculate the CAPEX and energy, the mass transfer
   properties and hydraulic data for these packings were obtained from
   previous experimental measurements. The minimum total cost for each
   packing was compared to find the lowest total cost and optimum packing.
   The total cost decreases with uG at first (CAPEX dominant) and then
   increases (Energy dominant). The minimum total cost represents a
   trade-off between CAPEX and Energy, and it is achieved at the
   intersection of the CAPEX region and the energy region.
   The optimum operating velocity is between 50 and 80\% flood for all
   packings, which deviates from the experience with distillation column
   design, usually optimized at 70-90\% flood. The lowest total absorber
   cost from this study is given by packing 200X-H with a value of
   \$4.04/ton CO2 removed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique that
   constructs a depth-resolved image by measuring the optical path-length
   difference between broadband light backscattered from a sample and a
   reference surface. For many OCT sample arm optical configurations,
   sample illumination and backscattered light detection share a common
   path. When a phase mask is placed in the sample path, features in the
   detected signal are observed, which suggests that an analysis of a
   generic common path OCT imaging system is warranted. In this study, we
   present a Fourier optics analysis using a Fresnel diffraction
   approximation of an OCT system with a path-length-multiplexing element
   (PME) inserted in the sample arm optics. The analysis may be generalized
   for most phase-mask-based OCT systems. A radial-angle-diverse PME is
   analyzed in detail, and the point spread function, coherent transfer
   function, sensitivity of backscattering angular diversity detection, and
   signal formation in terms of sample spatial frequency are simulated and
   discussed. The analysis reveals important imaging features and
   application limitations of OCT imaging systems with a phase mask in the
   sample path optics. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) have become the most
   widely used source of mid-infrared radiation, finding large scale
   applications because of their wide tunability and overall high
   performance. However far-infrared (terahertz) QCLs have lagged behind in
   terms of performance and impact due to the inability so far of achieving
   room temperature operation. Here we review recent research that has led
   to a new class of QCL light sources that has overcome these limitations
   leading to room temperature operation in the terahertz spectral range,
   with nearly 2 mW of optical power and significant tunability, opening up
   also this region of the spectrum to a wide range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recent droughts and heat waves have revealed the vulnerability of some
   power plants to effects from higher temperature intake water for
   cooling. In this evaluation, we develop a methodology for predicting
   whether power plants are at risk of violating thermal pollution limits.
   We begin by developing a regression model of average monthly intake
   temperatures for open loop and recirculating cooling pond systems. We
   then integrate that information into a thermodynamic model of energy
   flows within each power plant to determine the change in cooling water
   temperature that occurs at each plant and the relationship of that water
   temperature to other plants in the river system. We use these models
   together with climate change models to estimate the monthly effluent
   temperature at twenty-six power plants in the Upper Mississippi River
   Basin and Texas between 2015 and 2035 to predict which ones are at risk
   of reaching thermal pollution limits. The intake model shows that two
   plants could face elevated intake temperatures between 2015 and 2035
   compared to the 2010-2013 baseline. In general, a rise in ambient
   cooling water temperature of 1 degrees C could cause a drop in power
   output of 0.15\%-0.5\%. The energy balance shows that twelve plants
   might exceed state summer effluent limits. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Surface waves in topological states of quantum matter exhibit unique
   protection from backscattering induced by disorders, making them ideal
   carriers for both classical and quantum information. Topological matters
   for electrons and photons are largely limited by the range of bulk
   properties, and the associated performance trade-offs. In contrast,
   phononic metamaterials provide access to a much wider range of material
   properties. Here we demonstrate numerically a phononic topological
   metamaterial in an elastic-wave analogue of the quantum spin Hall
   effect. A dual-scale phononic crystal slab is used to support two
   effective spins for phonons over a broad bandwidth, and strong
   spin-orbit coupling is realized by breaking spatial mirror symmetry. By
   preserving the spin polarization with an external load or spatial
   symmetry, phononic edge states are shown to be robust against scattering
   from discrete defects as well as disorders in the continuum,
   demonstrating topological protection for phonons in both static and
   time-dependent regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Foam flooding is a promising technique for achieving mobility control
   and diverting fluid into low-permeability strata in post-water-flooding
   reservoirs. However, foam flow is very complicated and is influenced by
   many factors which have not been studied and explored very rigorously
   (i.e. permeability, surfactant concentration, foam quality, reservoir
   temperature, oil saturation, water saturation and seepage velocity).
   Based on core flooding experiments of foam flowing and blocking rules
   using two kinds of foaming agents, a novel model of foam flooding
   considering the influences of the above factors is established and
   solved using a reservoir simulator which is formulated using the IMPES
   method in conjunction with a Runge-Kutta method. Then, the validation is
   performed by core flooding experiments in both the absence and presence
   of oil. Finally, the simulator is used to investigate the effects of the
   permeability max-min ratio, ratio of vertical to horizontal
   permeability, gas-liquid ratio, depositional sequence, foaming agent
   concentration, and reservoir temperature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an equilibrium formulation for incorporating
   parking search into traffic network assignment models. The proposed
   model allows general network topologies and reflects uncertainty related
   to parking availability, including the possibility of cycling behavior
   as drivers search for parking. The equilibrium framework represents the
   mutual dependence between the probabilities of finding parking at
   different locations and the search processes employed by drivers to
   minimize total expected journey time (or cost). In this framework,
   network loading is represented by a system of nonlinear flow
   conservation networks, and feasibility and uniqueness issues are
   discussed. The equilibrium problem is formulated as a variational
   inequality and a convex combinations heuristic is proposed. Numerical
   results show that neglecting parking search can substantially
   underestimate network flows, and quantitatively demonstrate the
   relationship between parking duration effects and the cost of time spent
   walking relative to driving, and the expected driving and walking times.

Abstract = {{The ability to distinguish macrophage subtypes noninvasively could have
   diagnostic potential in cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes, where
   polarized M1 and M2 macrophages play critical and often opposing roles.
   Current methods to distinguish macrophage subtypes rely on tissue
   biopsy. Optical imaging techniques based on light scattering are of
   interest as they can be translated into biopsy-free strategies. Because
   mitochondria are relatively strong subcellular light scattering centers,
   and M2 macrophages are known to have enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis
   compared to M1, we hypothesized that M1 and M2 macrophages may have
   different angular light scattering profiles. To test this, we developed
   an in vitro angle-resolved forward light scattering measurement system.
   We found that M1 and M2 macrophage monolayers scatter relatively unequal
   amounts of light in the forward direction between 1.6 deg and 3.2 deg
   with M2 forward scattering significantly more light than M1 at
   increasing angles. The ratio of forward scattering can be used to
   identify the polarization state of macrophage populations in culture.

Title = {{Impact of Shale-Gas Apparent Permeability on Production: Combined
   Effects of Non-Darcy Flow/Gas Slippage, Desorption, and Geomechanics}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Permeability is one of the most fundamental reservoir-rock properties
   required for modeling hydrocarbon production. Many shale-gas and
   ultralow-permeability tight gas reservoirs can have matrix-permeability
   values in the range of tens to hundreds of nanodarcies. The ultrafine
   pore structure of these rocks can cause violation of the basic
   assumptions behind Darcy's law. Depending on a combination of
   pressure-temperature conditions, pore structure and gas properties,
   non-Darcy flow mechanisms such as Knudsen diffusion, and/or gas-slippage
   effects will affect the matrix apparent permeability.
   Even though numerous theoretical and empirical models were proposed to
   describe the increasing apparent permeability caused by non-Darcy
   flow/gas-slippage behavior in nanopore space, few literature sources
   have investigated the impact of formation compaction and the release of
   the adsorption gas layer upon shale-matrix apparent permeability during
   reservoir depletion.
   In this article, we first present a thorough review on gas flow in shale
   nanopore space and discuss the factors that can affect shale-matrix
   apparent permeability, besides the well-studied non-Darcy
   flow/gas-slippage behavior. Then, a unified shale-matrix
   apparent-permeability model is proposed to bridge the effects of
   non-Darcy flow/gas-slippage, geomechanics (formation compaction), and
   the release of the adsorption gas layer into a single, coherent
   equation. In addition, a mathematical framework for an unconventional
   reservoir simulator that was developed for this study is also presented.
   Different matrix apparent-permeability models are implemented in our
   numerical simulator to examine how the various factors affect matrix
   apparent permeability within the simulated reservoir volume. Finally,
   the impact of a natural-fracture network on matrix apparent-permeability
   evolution is investigated. The results indicate that, even though the
   conductive fracture network plays a vital role in shale-gas production,
   the matrix apparent-permeability evolution during pressure depletion
   cannot be neglected for accurate production modeling.}},

Title = {{Oil-Rate Forecast by Inferring Fractional-Flow Models From Field Data
   With Koval Method Combined With the Capacitance/Resistance Model}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Many empirical and analytical models were developed to forecast oil
   production. Empirical models (including data-driven models) can, for
   example, find correlations between oil cut and production, but they lack
   explicit knowledge of the physical behavior. Classic analytical models
   are loyal to reservoir physics. Nevertheless, they often require
   estimation of water saturation as a function of time, which is difficult
   to obtain for multiwell reservoirs. It is desirable to combine
   advantages of both empirical and analytical models and develop a
   physical-model-based method that uses field data to infer oil rate.
   In this paper, we propose to infer fractional-flow models from field
   data by use of the Koval (1963) theory. We inversely solved the Koval
   fractional-flow equation to obtain a relationship between water cut and
   dimensionless time. By history matching field water-cut data, two model
   parameters, the Koval factor and the producer-drainage volume, are
   estimated. Nevertheless, it is challenging to use the Koval approach as
   a predictive model directly because the injection contribution into each
   producer in a future-time horizon must be evaluated first.
   To address this issue, we combine the Koval approach with the
   capacitance/resistance model (CRM), which characterizes the
   injector/producer connectivities and response time. The material balance
   of fluids is established in a producer-based drainage volume to consider
   the contributions from nearby injectors and the time lag in production
   caused by reservoir/fluids compressibility. A regression approach is
   simultaneously advanced to minimize the model error. Because of robustly
   integrating the reservoir physical behavior and the data-driven
   approach, the combination of the Koval theory and the CRM can result in
   a synergy that leads to accurate oil-rate predictions.
   We validated this integrated method in synthetic homogeneous and
   heterogeneous reservoirs to test its reliability, and further applied it
   to a field case in western Venezuela. Case studies demonstrate that one
   can use this integrated model as a real-time tool to characterize
   interwell connection and to predict future oil production accurately.}},

Title = {{New Analytical Method To Calculate Matrix- and Fluid-Corrected Total
   Porosity in Organic Shale}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{609-623}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Estimation of total porosity from neutron and density porosity logs in
   organic shale (source rock) is challenging because these logs are
   substantially affected by fluid and matrix-composition effects.
   Conventional interpretation of neutron and density porosity logs often
   includes corrections for shale concentration in which the main objective
   is to improve the calculation of nonshale porosity in
   hydrocarbon-bearing zones. These corrections are not desirable in
   unconventional rock formations because shale pores can be
   hydrocarbon-saturated. Neutron and density porosity readings across
   shale zones are sometimes averaged by use of the root-mean-square (RMS)
   method.
   We introduce a new and simple analytical expression for total porosity
   that effectively separates both matrix and fluid effects on neutron and
   density porosity logs. The expression stems from a new nonlinear mixing
   law for neutron migration length that is coupled with the linear-density
   mixing law to calculate total porosity and fluid density. The method is
   applied in two sequential steps: First, separate corrections for only
   matrix effects are implemented to enhance the neutron-density crossover
   for qualitative interpretation of fluid type; second, the coupled
   equation is used to estimate fluid density and actual porosity devoid of
   matrix and fluid effects. Calculated porosity and fluid density can be
   used further to calculate water saturation from density logs. One
   remarkable feature of this method is the ease with which it can be
   applied to obtain accurate and reliable results. Application of the
   method only requires knowledge of single-component nuclear properties
   and mineral volumetric concentrations. One can obtain nuclear properties
   from a set of charts for multiple fluid types and minerals provided in
   this paper, whereas one can calculate mineral concentrations on the
   basis of available triple combo logs or gamma ray spectroscopy logs.
   Two synthetic and four field examples (two conventional and two
   shale-gas reservoirs) are used to test the method. First, we describe an
   application in a conventional siliciclastic sedimentary sequence in
   which only shale concentration calculated from gamma ray logs is
   required to improve the estimation of porosity in shaly sections.
   Second, we document several applications in which gamma ray spectroscopy
   logs are used together with a reliable hypothesis for clay type to
   define mineral properties. Results compare well with
   nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) and core measurements, whereas the new
   method outperforms the conventional RMS procedure, especially in the
   cases of gas-bearing, low-porosity organic shale. The new analytical
   method can be readily implemented on an Excel spreadsheet and requires
   minimal adjustments for its operation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the reliable path problem in the form of minimizing
   the sum of mean and standard deviation of path travel time. For the case
   of independent link travel times, we show that the problem can be solved
   exactly by repeatedly solving a subproblem minimizing the sum of mean
   and variance of path travel time. The latter is an additive shortest
   path problem, and can be solved using a standard labeling algorithm.
   While these subproblems are similar in form to those obtained from
   Lagrangian relaxation, this formulation admits proof of finite
   convergence to the optimal solution. An iterative labeling algorithm is
   developed that solves the non-additive reliable path problem from a
   single origin to all destinations. Moreover, a labeling technique is
   employed to further reduce the computational time of the proposed
   algorithm by partially updating the network in each iteration. As an
   alternative, a bisection-type search algorithm is developed that solves
   the problem for the single-origin and single-destination case. Numerical
   tests are presented, indicating that the proposed algorithm outperform
   others recently proposed in the literature: unlike Lagrangian
   relaxation, two of the proposed algorithms find solutions exactly, and
   the computation time is an order of magnitude faster than outer
   approximation methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A database is presented with 278 tests on non-slender reinforced
   concrete beams with vertical stirrups. These beams are commonly referred
   to as non-slender beams because they have shear span-depth ratios (aid)
   less than 2.4. In keeping with European terminology the term ``deep
   beams{''} is not used for these beams, because in Europe, deep beams are
   often defined only for ratios of a/d < 1 and always contain vertical as
   well as horizontal reinforcement in their web. After having applied
   several control/filtering criteria, 178 beams remained in the evaluation
   database that can be used to check conservativeness and accuracy of
   relevant design provisions. For example, the application of
   strut-and-tie models of ACI 318-14 to non-slender beams with stirrups
   (and without any horizontal skin reinforcement) was unconservative-that
   is, it yielded database analysis results that were above the desired 5\%
   fractile. Almost all unconservative estimations were obtained for test
   specimens with very low amounts of stirrups. This problem can be solved
   either by increasing the required amount of minimum reinforcement in the
   vertical direction or by placing a minimum amount of reinforcement in
   both the horizontal and vertical direction. It is also important to note
   that a comparison with Kani's shear valley showed that for a/d < 1, the
   valley was not filled up to the full flexural capacity, despite the
   presence of vertical stirrups in test specimens.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research was to create very polydisperse
   concentrated heavy oil-in-water emulsions by optimizing the co-solvents,
   surfactants, alkali, and electrolytes in the chemical formulation, with
   respect to the droplet size distribution. Novel co-solvents that have
   shown superior performance in chemical formulations used for enhanced
   oil recovery have been tested. Droplet size distributions that resulted
   in a lower emulsion viscosity were determined, to have a higher mean
   droplet diameter (d(32)) and a bimodal droplet size distribution with a
   diameter ratio (d(32L)/d(32,s)) of > 6 and a volume fraction (phi(s)/
   (phi(L) + phi(S))) of 0.2-0.3, where phi is the volume fraction of the
   dispersed phase and the subscripts L and S correspond to the larger and
   smaller peaks in the bimodal distribution. We report the effects of
   various chemical formulations on the droplet size distribution of heavy
   oil-in-water emulsions with a particular emphasis on d(32) and, for the
   first time, the maximum packing fraction (phi(m)) of oil droplets. A
   novel one-step preparation procedure is proposed to prepare concentrated
   multimodal oil-in-water emulsions with a new chemical formulation
   approach. We were able to formulate stable oil-in-water emulsions with
   phi(m) values as high as 0.95, which is similar to 0.30 higher than the
   theoretical phi(m) value for random close packed monodisperse spheres
   (0.64). We observed the optimal particle size distribution of
   concentrated heavy Oil-in-Water emulsions prepared with co-solvents for
   maximum packing at similar to 75\% of the Na+ concentration necessary to
   reach the oil-in-water to water-in-oil inversion point for anionic
   surfactants. An important application of this study is the transport of
   heavy oils in pipelines.}},

Title = {{Numerical modeling of non-planar hydraulic fracture propagation in

Abstract = {{With the increasingly wide use of hydraulic fracturing in the petroleum
   industry, it is essential to accurately predict the behavior of fracture
   propagations based on the understanding of fundamental mechanisms
   governing the process. For unconventional resources exploration and
   development, hydraulic fracture pattern, geometry and associated
   dimensions are critical in determining well stimulation efficiency. In
   shale formations, non-planar, complex hydraulic fractures are often
   observed, due to the activation of pre-existing natural fractures. The
   propagating of turning non-planar fractures due to refracturing
   treatment and unfavorable perforation conditions have also been
   reported. Current numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing generally
   assumes planar crack geometry and weak coupling behaviors, which
   severely limits the applicability of these methods in predicting
   fracture propagation under complex subsurface conditions. In addition,
   the prevailing approach for hydraulic fracture modeling also relies on
   Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), which uses stress intensity
   factor at the fracture tip as fracture propagation criteria. Even though
   LEFM can predict hard rock hydraulic fracturing processes reasonably,
   but often fails to give accurate predictions of fracture geometry and
   propagation pressure in ductile rocks, such as poorly
   consolidated/unconsolidated sands and clay-rich ductile shales, even in
   the form of simple planar geometry. In this study, a fully coupled
   non-planar hydraulic fracture propagation model in permeable medium
   based on the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), Cohesive Zone Method
   (CZM) and Mohr-Coulomb theory of plasticity is developed for the first
   time, which is able to model fracture initiation and propagation in both
   brittle and ductile formations. To illustrate the capabilities of the
   presented model, example simulations are presented on both near wellbore
   and far field scale. The results indicate that the in-elastic
   deformations induced by propagating hydraulic fracture have significant
   impact on propagation pressure and fracture geometry, and the prediction
   of fracture propagation behaviors can be extremely erroneous if ductile
   formations are simply treated as soft rocks with lower Young's modulus.
   The method discussed in this article represents a useful step towards
   the prediction of non-planar, complex hydraulic fractures and can
   provide us a better guidance of completion design and optimizing
   hydraulic fracture treatment that will better drain reservoir volume in
   formations with complex stress conditions and heterogeneous properties.

Abstract = {{Well testing method has historically been the main source of formation
   evaluation in oilfields. This work demonstrates well testing analysis
   for formation evaluation in crossflow triple-layer reservoirs by polymer
   flooding, and a well testing model is proposed by considering mechanical
   degradation, dispersion, convection, and shear-thinning of polymer
   solutions. The type curves, having five segments with different flow
   regime, are developed based on this model, and parameter sensitivity is
   analyzed. The typical characteristic is the existence of two `concaves'
   in the type curves, distinguished from one-layer and double-layer
   reservoirs. A field test validates the proposed well testing model,
   which can effectively evaluate the layered permeability and skin factor.
   Furthermore, formation damage due to adsorption of polymers at the rock
   surface is estimated through comparison of the interpreted parameters
   with the values prior to polymer flooding, which explores the
   feasibility of applying this interpretation method in formation
   evaluation of polymer flooding reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally verify the unusual radiation properties of sources

   narrow (ENZ) channels. By utilizing the unique properties of a narrow
   waveguide channel operated at cutoff, a static-like uniformly enhanced
   electric field distribution can be induced at microwave frequencies over
   long distances. First, we show how this field uniformity provides a
   mechanism for position-invariant impedance matching for localized
   sources placed within the channel, enabling a unique
   coaxial-to-waveguide matching highly invariant to discontinuities. We
   then extend these concepts to sources placed outside the ENZ channels,
   realizing a microwave lens with unique radiation patterning properties.
   The realized ENZ lens is experimentally demonstrated under several
   excitation conditions, highlighting the possibility of tailoring the
   impinging wavefront with large flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{The propagation of surface waves along electrically and magnetically
   biased graphene-based cylindrical waveguides (GCWs) is investigated in

   multiple (coaxial-like) graphene layers. The proposed formulation
   reveals a fundamental connection between surface plasmons found in
   GCWs/carbon nanotubes and planar graphene structures. Numerical results
   confirm the higher confinement of modes supported by GCWs compared with
   their planar counterparts, while keeping a similar level of losses. The
   proposed structure is applied to develop plasmonic reconfigurable dipole
   antennas in the low THz band, which provide higher radiation efficiency
   than current graphene-based radiators, without requiring the presence of

Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum leasing (DSL) is a promising method to improve the
   spectrum efficiency. A lot of work has been done about spectrum sharing
   issues with static models. In this paper, we want to study the behavior
   of the primary users (PUs) under uncertainty. For this objective, we
   propose a model with time-varying parameters. The model captures both
   technical and economic features. We study the long-term behavior of the
   PUs in the model with stochastic Cournot game theory and variational
   inequality theory. We show that the PUs can maximize their long-term
   utilities with a static supply of spectrum. In addition, we also propose
   two algorithms based on stochastic approximation theory. The convergence
   and performance of the algorithms are demonstrated theoretically and
   numerically. The proposed model and analytical framework can be used to
   study and predict the behaviors of PUs given a DSL system and provide
   design insights for the DSL system.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we extend the Spatial Markov model, which has been
   successfully used to upscale conservative transport across a diverse
   range of porous media flows, to test if it can accurately upscale
   reactive transport, defined by a spatially heterogeneous first order
   degradation rate. We test the model in a well known highly simplified
   geometry, commonly considered as an idealized pore or fracture
   structure, a periodic channel with wavy boundaries. The edges of the
   flow domain have a layer through which there is no flow, but in which
   diffusion of a solute still occurs. Reactions are confined to this
   region. We demonstrate that the Spatial Markov model, an upscaled random
   walk model that enforces correlation between successive jumps, can
   reproduce breakthrough curves measured from microscale simulations that
   explicitly resolve all pertinent processes. We also demonstrate that a
   similar random walk model that does not enforce successive correlations
   is unable to reproduce all features of the measured breakthrough curves.

Abstract = {{The effect of argon (Ar+) ion beam treatment on the surface of
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) samples was studied by scanning probe
   microscopy (SPM) and the changes in surface topography were assessed by
   atomic force microscopy (AFM). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM)
   sheds light of adhesion force between treated polymer films and a Pt/Cr
   probe under dry conditions, obtaining the contact potential difference
   of material. As a result of Ar+ ion bombardment, important surface
   chemical changes were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   measurements such as chains scission and incorporation of nitrogen
   species. Ion beam treatment increases the surface roughness from 0.49
   +/- 0.1 nm to 7.2 +/- 0.1 nm and modify the surface potential of PET
   samples, decreasing the adhesive forces from 12.041 +/- 2.1 nN to 5.782
   +/- 0.06 nN, and producing a slight increase in the electronic work
   function (Phi(e)) from 5.1 V (untreated) to 5.2 V (treated). Ar+ ion
   beam treatment allows to potentially changing the surface properties of

Abstract = {{Congestion pricing has been proposed and investigated as an effective
   means of optimizing traffic assignment, alleviating congestion, and
   enhancing traffic operation efficiencies. Meanwhile, advanced traffic
   information dissemination systems, such as Advanced Traveler Information
   System (ATIS), have been developed and deployed to provide real-time,
   accurate, and complete network-wide traffic information to facilitate
   travelers' trip plans and routing selections. Recent advances in ATIS
   technologies, especially telecommunication technology, allow dynamic,
   personalized, and multimodal traffic information to be disseminated and
   impact travelers' choices of departure times, alternative routes, and
   travel modes in the context of congestion pricing. However, few studies
   were conducted to determine the impact of traffic information
   dissemination on toll road utilizations. In this study, the effects of
   the provisions of traffic information on toll road usage are
   investigated and analyzed based on a stated preference survey conducted
   in Texas. A Bayesian Network (BN)-based approach is developed to
   discover travelers' opinions and preferences for toll road utilization
   supported by network-wide traffic information provisions. The
   probabilistic interdependencies among various attributes, including
   routing choice, departure time, traffic information dissemination mode,
   content, coverage, commuter demographic information, and travel
   patterns, are identified and their impacts on toll road usage are
   quantified. The results indicate that the BN model performs reasonably
   well in travelers' preference classifications for toll road utilization
   and knowledge extraction. The BN Most Probable Explanation (MPE)
   measurement, probability inference and variable influence analysis
   results illustrate travelers using highway advisory radio and internet
   as their primary mode of receiving traffic information are more likely
   to comply with routing recommendations and use toll roads. Traffic
   information regarding congested roads, road hazard warnings, and
   accident locations is of great interest to travelers, who tend to
   acquire such information and use toll roads more frequently. Travel time
   formation for home-based trips can considerably enhance travelers'
   preferences for toll road usage. Female travelers tend to seek traffic
   information and utilize toll roads more frequently. As expected, the
   information provided at both pre-trip and en-route stages can positively
   influence travelers' preferences for toll road usage. The proposed
   methodology and research findings advance our previous study and provide
   insight into travelers' behavioral tendencies concerning toll road
   utilization in support of traffic information dissemination. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Antenna arrays will be an important ingredient in millimeter-wave
   (mmWave) cellular systems. A natural application of antenna arrays is
   simultaneous transmission to multiple users. Unfortunately, the hardware
   constraints in mmWave systems make it difficult to apply conventional
   lower frequency multiuser MIMO precoding techniques at mmWave. This
   paper develops low-complexity hybrid analog/digital precoding for
   downlink multiuser mmWave systems. Hybrid precoding involves a
   combination of analog and digital processing that is inspired by the
   power consumption of complete radio frequency and mixed signal hardware.
   The proposed algorithm configures hybrid precoders at the transmitter
   and analog combiners at multiple receivers with a small training and
   feedback overhead. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed
   in the large dimensional regime and in single-path channels. When the
   analog and digital precoding vectors are selected from quantized
   codebooks, the rate loss due to the joint quantization is characterized,
   and insights are given into the performance of hybrid precoding compared
   with analog-only beamforming solutions. Analytical and simulation
   results show that the proposed techniques offer higher sum rates
   compared with analog-only beamforming solutions, and approach the
   performance of the unconstrained digital beamforming with relatively
   small codebooks.}},

Title = {{Metabolic engineering of Yarrowia lipolytica for itaconic acid
   production}},
Journal = {{METABOLIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{66-73}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Itaconic acid is a naturally produced organic acid with diverse
   applications as a replacement for petroleum derived products. However,
   its industrial viability as a bio-replacement has been restricted due to
   limitations with native producers. In this light, Yarrowia lipolytica is
   an excellent potential candidate for itaconic acid production due to its
   innate capacity to accumulate citric acid cycle intermediates and
   tolerance to lower pH. Here, we demonstrate the capacity to produce
   itaconic acid in Y, lipolytica through heterologous expression of the
   itaconic acid synthesis enzyme, resulting in an initial titer of 33
   mg/L. Further optimizations of this strain via metabolic pathway
   engineering, enzyme localization, and media optimization strategies
   enabled 4.6 g/L of itaconic acid to be produced in bioreactors,
   representing a 140-fold improvement over initial titer. Moreover, these
   fermentation conditions did not require additional nutrient
   supplementation and utilized a low pH condition that enabled the acid
   form of itaconic acid to be produced. Overall yields (0.058 g/g yield
   from glucose) and maximum productivity of 0.045 g/L/h still provide

Abstract = {{Background: The hand pattern used during manual wheelchair propulsion
   (i.e., full-cycle hand path) can provide insight into an individual's
   propulsion technique. However, previous analyses of hand patterns have
   been limited by their focus on a single propulsion condition and
   reliance on subjective qualitative characterization methods. The purpose
   of this study was to develop a set of objective quantitative parameters
   to characterize hand patterns and determine the influence of propulsion
   speed and grade of incline on the patterns preferred by manual
   wheelchair users.
   Methods: Kinematic and kinetic data were collected from 170 experienced
   manual wheelchair users on an ergometer during three conditions: level
   propulsion at their self-selected speed, level propulsion at their
   fastest comfortable speed and graded propulsion (8\%) at their level
   self-selected speed. Hand patterns were quantified using a set of
   objective parameters, and differences across conditions were identified.
   Findings: Increased propulsion speed resulted in a shift away from
   under-rim hand patterns. Increased grade of incline resulted in the hand
   remaining near the handrim throughout the cycle.
   Interpretation: Manual wheelchair users change their hand pattern based
   on task-specific constraints and goals. Further work is needed to
   investigate how differences between hand patterns influence upper
   extremity demand and potentially lead to the development of overuse
   injuries and pain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphate groups are commonly observed in biomolecules such as nucleic
   acids and lipids. Due to their highly charged and polarizable nature,
   modeling these compounds with classical force fields is challenging.
   Using quantum mechanical studies and liquid-phase simulations, the
   AMOEBA force field for dimethyl phosphate (DIP) ion and trimethyl
   phosphate (TMP) has been developed. On the basis of ab initio
   calculations, it was found that ion binding and the solution environment
   significantly impact both the molecular geometry and the energy
   differences between conformations. Atomic multipole moments are derived
   from MP2/cc-pVQZ calculations of methyl phosphates at several
   conformations with their chemical environments taken into account.
   Many-body polarization is handled via a Thole-style induction model
   using distributed atomic polarizabilities. van der Waals parameters of
   phosphate and oxygen atoms are determined by fitting to the quantum
   mechanical interaction energy curves for water with DMP or TMP.
   Additional stretch-torsion and angle-torsion coupling terms were
   introduced in order to capture asymmetry in P-O bond lengths and angles
   due to the generalized anomeric effect. The resulting force field for
   DMP and TMP is able to accurately describe both the molecular structure
   and conformational energy surface, including bond and angle variations
   with conformation, as well as interaction of both species with water and
   metal ions. The force field was further validated for TMP in the
   condensed phase by computing hydration free energy, liquid density, and
   heat of vaporization. The polarization behavior between liquid TMP and
   TMP in water is drastically different.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a convex optimizations-based method to compute the
   set of initial conditions from which a given landing accuracy to a
   target can be achieved (constrained controllability set) and the set of
   states that can be reached from a given set of initial states
   (constrained reachability set) for a planetary landing vehicle with all
   the relevant control and mission constraints. The proposed method is
   based on the lossless convexification of the powered-descent landing
   guidance problem and methods of convex optimization and computational
   geometry. These techniques are used to generate approximations that can
   be arbitrarily close to the actual reachability or controllability sets.
   The quantification of these sets allows evaluation of the feasibility of
   a prescribed landing accuracy for a given vehicle and an expected set of
   dispersions from the parachute descent phase of a planetary landing
   mission. Since these sets are generated systematically and quickly, a
   wide range of design options can be evaluated for different mission
   requirements. Consequently, the proposed method can enable lander
   vehicle design optimization as a reliable analysis tool for systematic
   design and system engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the great success that has been accomplished on the controlled
   synthesis of Pd nanocrystals with various sizes and morphologies, an
   efficient approach to systematic production of well-defined Pd
   nanocrystals without seed-mediated approaches remains a significant
   challenge. In this work, we have developed an efficient synthetic method
   to directly produce Pd nanocrystals with a highly controllable feature.
   Three distinct Pd nanocrystals, namely, Pd nanosheets, Pd concave
   tetrahedra, and Pd tetrahedra, have been selectively prepared by simply
   introducing a small amount of ascorbic acid (AA) and/or water without
   the other synthesis conditions changed. We found that the combined use
   of AA and water is of importance for the successful production of the
   unique Pd nanosheets. Detailed catalytic investigations showed that all
   the obtained Pd nanocrystals exhibit higher activity in the formic acid
   electrooxidation and styrene hydrogenation with respect to the Pd black,
   and their activities are highly shape-dependent with Pd nanosheets
   demonstrating a higher activity than both the Pd concave tetrahedra and
   Pd tetrahedra, which is likely due to the simple yet important feature
   of ultrathin thickness of Pd nanosheets. The present work highlights the
   importance of structures in tuning the related properties of metallic
   nanocrystals.}},

   materials that show great potential in many energy, environmental, and

   as a model system) using a rational dopant counterion, which is a
   disc-shaped liquid crystal molecular copper
   phthalocyanine-3,4',4{''},4'''-tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt
   (CuPcTs). The dopant molecule CuPcTs cross-linked the PPy chains to form
   a three-dimensional network that gelated into a hydrogel. The PPy
   hydrogel could be synthesized in bulk quantities with uniform morphology
   of self-assembled interconnected nanofibers. The tetra-functional dopant
   favors a supramolecular self-assembly mechanism to form one-dimensional
   PPy nanostructures. Furthermore, the enhanced interchain charge
   transport of CuPcTs doped PPy resulted in greatly enhanced conductivity
   and pseudocapacitance compared with pristine PPy.}},

   methods to improve the engineering properties of granular soils.
   However, the low penetrability of bentonite grouts into soils limits
   their practical application in permeation grouting. This study presents
   a new approach to control the penetration length of bentonite grouts
   through granular soils using an ionic additive, sodium pyrophosphate
   (SPP). It is hypothesized that the chemical modification changes both
   rheological and physicochemical properties of the bentonite grout, and
   thus affects its penetration length through soils. The rheological
   properties (yield stress and apparent viscosity) of bentonite grouts
   with weight ratios (ratio of water to dry bentonite, W/B) of 19, 12.3,
   9, and 7.3 were controlled by the addition of 1\%-4\% SPP by weight of
   dry bentonite. The bentonite grouts were also injected into sand columns
   prepared at various experimental conditions to evaluate the effect of
   each experimental parameter on their penetration lengths. The results
   show that the penetration length of bentonite grouts decreases with a
   decrease in W/B ratio and an increase in yield stress and apparent
   viscosity. Moreover, the penetration length increases with the increase
   of the normalized effective grain size and injection pressure, but the
   increase of fines content reduces the penetration length of the grouts.
   While the existing analytical equation produces good agreement with the
   measured penetration lengths for the grouts having high yield stress
   (>26 Pa), it significantly overestimates the penetration lengths of the
   SPP modified bentonite grouts due to filtration (especially, the grouts
   having low yield stress and low W/B ratios). Therefore, a new empirical
   correlation is proposed to predict the penetration length of the
   bentonite grouts based on filtration and rheological blocking.}},

Abstract = {{Bimolecular diffusion coefficients are important parameters used by
   atmospheric models to calculate altitude profiles of minor constituents
   in an atmosphere. Unfortunately, laboratory measurements of these
   coefficients were never conducted at temperature conditions relevant to
   the atmosphere of Titan. Here we conduct a detailed uncertainty analysis
   of the bimolecular diffusion coefficient parameters as applied to
   Titan's upper atmosphere to provide a better understanding of the impact
   of uncertainty for this parameter on models. Because temperature and
   pressure conditions are much lower than the laboratory conditions in
   which bimolecular diffusion parameters were measured, we apply a
   Bayesian framework, a problem-agnostic framework, to determine parameter
   estimates and associated uncertainties. We solve the Bayesian
   calibration problem using the open-source QUESO library which also
   performs a propagation of uncertainties in the calibrated parameters to
   temperature and pressure conditions observed in Titan's upper
   atmosphere. Our results show that, after propagating uncertainty through
   the Massman model, the uncertainty in molecular diffusion is highly
   correlated to temperature and we observe no noticeable correlation with
   pressure. We propagate the calibrated molecular diffusion estimate and
   associated uncertainty to obtain an estimate with uncertainty due to
   bimolecular diffusion for the methane molar fraction as a function of
   altitude. Results show that the uncertainty in methane abundance due to
   molecular diffusion is in general small compared to eddy diffusion and
   the chemical kinetics description. However, methane abundance is most
   sensitive to uncertainty in molecular diffusion above 1200 km where the
   errors are nontrivial and could have important implications for
   scientific research based on diffusion models in this altitude range.

Abstract = {{This paper formulates a multiple discrete-continuous probit (MDCP) land
   use model within a spatially explicit economic structural framework for
   land use change decisions. The spatial MDCP model is capable of
   predicting both the type and intensity of urban development patterns
   over large geographic areas, while also explicitly acknowledging
   geographic proximity-based spatial dependencies in these patterns. At a
   methodological level, the paper focuses on specifying and estimating a
   spatial MDCP model that allows the dependent variable to exist in
   multiple discrete states with an intensity associated with each discrete
   state. The formulation also accommodates spatial dependencies, as well
   as spatial heterogeneity and heteroskedasticity, in the dependent
   variable, and should be applicable in a wide variety of fields where
   social and spatial dependencies between decision agents (or observation
   units) lead to spillover effects in multiple discrete-continuous choices
   (or states). A simulation exercise is undertaken to evaluate the ability
   of the proposed maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood
   (MACML) approach to recover parameters from a cross-sectional spatial
   MDCP model. The results show that the MACML approach does well in
   recovering parameters. An empirical demonstration of the approach is
   undertaken using the city of Austin parcel level land use data.}},

Abstract = {{A wind turbine achieves its highest energy efficiency during partial
   load operation when it operates at the optimal tip speed ratio (TSR),
   thus the optimal power coefficient. In this paper, real-time controllers
   are developed to improve the performance of tracking the optimal TSR
   during partial load operation. Dynamic programming (DP) is first applied
   to determine the control actions that maximize wind energy capture. A
   DP-based real-time controller (DPRC) is then explored to overcome the
   high computational expense associated with DP, which limits DP to be an
   offline optimization algorithm. However, the DPRC is not robust against
   plant-model mismatch and model uncertainties. A gain-modified optimal
   torque controller (GMOTC) is subsequently designed as an alternative to
   the DPRC. The GMOTC applies internal Proportional-Integral technique to
   track a reference TSR, and adapts the reference TSR to the optimal TSR
   in real time to improve the controller robustness. The light detection
   and ranging technology is used to further strengthen the controller
   performance by providing reliable previewed wind speed measurements.
   Simulation results show that the DRPC generates more wind power than the
   standard torque controller (STC), while the GMOTC demonstrates a
   performance similar to that of the DRPC on wind power generation with
   much better robustness in the presence of modeling error. Fatigue
   loading on a wind turbine is another important issue that needs to be
   considered during control design. The analysis shows that both the DRPC
   and the GMOTC are comparable with the STC in generating variable
   torsional loads due to the torque commands.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents and analyzes a novel concatenated coding scheme for
   enabling error resilience in two distributed storage settings: one being
   storage using existing regenerating codes and the second being storage
   using locally repairable codes. The concatenated coding scheme brings
   together a maximum rank distance code as an outer code and either a
   globally regenerating or a locally repairable code as an inner code. In
   addition, error resilience for combination of locally repairable codes
   with regenerating codes is considered. This concatenated coding system
   is designed to handle two different types of adversarial errors: the
   first type includes an adversary that can replace the content of an
   affected node only once; while the second type studies an adversary that
   is capable of polluting data an unbounded number of times. The paper
   establishes an upper bound on the resilience capacity for a locally
   repairable code. This paper also proves that the proposed concatenated
   coding approach attains the upper bound on the resilience capacity in
   the presence of the first type of adversary for both minimum storage
   regenerating codes and locally repairable codes. Further, this paper
   presents mechanisms that combine the presented concatenated coding
   scheme with subspace signatures to achieve error resilience for the
   second type of errors.}},

Abstract = {{Animal viruses frequently cause zoonotic disease in humans. As these
   viruses are highly diverse, evaluating the threat that they pose remains
   a major challenge, and efficient approaches are needed to rapidly
   predict virus-host compatibility. Here, we develop a combined
   computational and experimental approach to assess the compatibility of
   New World arenaviruses, endemic in rodents, with the host TfR1 entry
   receptors of different potential new host species. Using signatures of
   positive selection, we identify a small motif on rodent TfR1 that
   conveys species specificity to the entry of viruses into cells. However,
   we show that mutations in this region affect the entry of each
   arenavirus differently. For example, a human single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) in this region, L212V, makes human TfR1 a weaker
   receptor for one arenavirus, Machupo virus, but a stronger receptor for
   two other arenaviruses, Junin and Sabia viruses. Collectively, these
   findings set the stage for potential evolutionary tradeoffs, where
   natural selection for resistance to one virus may make humans or rodents
   susceptible to other arenavirus species. Given the complexity of this
   host-virus interplay, we propose a computational method to predict these
   interactions, based on homology modeling and computational docking of
   the virus-receptor protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate the
   utility of this model for Machupo virus, for which a suitable cocrystal
   structural template exists. Our model effectively predicts whether the
   TfR1 receptors of different species will be functional receptors for
   Machupo virus entry. Approaches such at this could provide a first step
   toward computationally predicting the ``host jumping{''} potential of a
   virus into a new host species.
   IMPORTANCE
   We demonstrate how evolutionary trade-offs may exist in the dynamic
   evolutionary interplay between viruses and their hosts, where natural
   selection for resistance to one virus could make humans or rodents
   susceptible to other virus species. We present an algorithm that
   predicts which species have cell surface receptors that make them
   susceptible to Machupo virus, based on computational docking of protein
   structures. Few molecular models exist for predicting the risk of
   spillover of a particular animal virus into humans or new animal
   populations. Our results suggest that a combination of evolutionary
   analysis, structural modeling, and experimental verification may provide
   an efficient approach for screening and assessing the potential
   spillover risks of viruses circulating in animal populations.}},

Abstract = {{The main supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) that are used today
   are industrial by-products. In most cases the quality of these materials
   cannot be controlled during their production, resulting in materials
   with varied characteristics. The adequate physical characterization of
   SCMs is important to better predict their performance and optimize their
   use in concretes production. There are standardized methods used to
   determine the particle characteristics for Portland cements that are
   usually adopted to characterize SCMs; however, these methods may not be
   as accurate when applied to SCMs. This paper is an overview of the
   techniques that are currently used for the determination of the density,
   particle size distribution, surface area and shape of SCMs. The main
   principles of each method are presented. The limitations that occur for
   the SCMs measurements are also discussed. This paper is an output from
   the work of the RILEM Technical Committee on Hydration and
   Microstructure of Concrete with Supplementary Cementitious Materials

Abstract = {{The particle size distribution, surface area and shape are fundamental
   characteristics of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). Accurate
   measurement of these properties is required in computational efforts to
   model the hydration process, and the characterization of these
   parameters is also an important practical issue during the production
   and use of blended cements. Since there are no standard procedures
   specifically for the determination of physical properties of SCMs, the
   techniques that are currently used for characterizing Portland cement
   are applied to SCMs. Based on the fact that most of the techniques have
   been developed to measure cements, limitations occur when these methods
   are used for other materials than cement, particularly when these have
   lower fineness and different particle shape and mineralogical
   composition. Here, samples of fly ash, granulated blast furnace slag and
   silica fume were tested. Different results obtained using several
   methods for the determination of specific surface area are presented.
   Recommendations for testing SCMs using air permeability, sieving, laser
   diffraction, BET, image analysis and MIP are provided, which represent

Abstract = {{Graphics processing units (GPU), due to their massive computational
   power with up to thousands of concurrent threads and general-purpose GPU
   (GPGPU) programming models such as CUDA and OpenCL, have opened up new
   opportunities for speeding up general-purpose parallel applications.
   Unfortunately, pre-silicon architectural simulation of modern-day GPGPU
   architectures and workloads is extremely time-consuming. This paper
   addresses the GPGPU simulation challenge by proposing a framework,
   called GPGPU-MiniBench, for generating miniature, yet representative
   GPGPU workloads. GPGPU-MiniBench first summarizes the inherent execution
   behavior of existing GPGPU workloads in a profile. The central component
   in the profile is the Divergence Flow Statistics Graph (DFSG), which
   characterizes the dynamic control flow behavior including loops and
   branches of a GPGPU kernel. GPGPU-MiniBench generates a synthetic
   miniature GPGPU kernel that exhibits similar execution characteristics
   as the original workload, yet its execution time is much shorter thereby
   dramatically speeding up architectural simulation. Our experimental
   results show that GPGPU-MiniBench can speed up GPGPU architectural
   simulation by a factor of 49x on average and up to 589x, with an average
   IPC error of 4.7 percent across a broad set of GPGPU benchmarks from the
   CUDA SDK, Rodinia and Parboil benchmark suites. We also demonstrate the
   usefulness of GPGPU-MiniBench for driving GPU architecture exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Robotic systems are increasingly relying on distributed feedback
   controllers to tackle complex sensing and decision problems, such as
   those found in highly articulated human-centered robots. These demands
   come at the cost of a growing computational burden and, as a result,
   larger controller latencies. To maximize robustness to mechanical
   disturbances by maximizing control feedback gains, this paper emphasizes
   the necessity for compromise between high-and low-level feedback control
   efforts in distributed controllers. Specifically, the effect of
   distributed impedance controllers is studied, where damping feedback
   effort is executed in close proximity to the control plant and stiffness
   feedback effort is executed in a latency-prone centralized control
   process. A central observation is that the stability of high-impedance
   distributed controllers is very sensitive to damping feedback delay but
   much less to stiffness feedback delay. This study pursues a detailed
   analysis of this observation that leads to a physical understanding of
   the disparity. Then, a practical controller breakdown gain rule is
   derived to aim at enabling control designers to consider the benefits of
   implementing their control applications in a distributed fashion. These
   considerations are further validated through the analysis, simulation,
   and experimental testing on high-performance actuators and on an
   omnidirectional mobile base.}},

Abstract = {{Based on SO(3) rotation group theory, a method is presented to fit
   -crystalline structure on to its corresponding electron microscopy (EM)
   model for the further diagnosis of crystalline disease. Taken EM model
   as a kind of -crystalline model rotation deformation, image processing
   techniques are firstly preformed and then mesh generation adopted on the
   obtained EM, depending upon its molecular features. Secondly, rigid-body
   fitting is performed to fit -crystalline Protein Data Bank (PDB) data
   onto its EM by using SO(3) rotation group theory. Among the fitting
   process, FFT is adopted to tackle the problems of large data and high
   computation. The PDB file is obtained from NCBI and EM file obtained
   from EMBL-EBI. All of the tools are developed by CVC, ICES, the
   University of Texas at Austin. The experimental results show that it's a
   precise and efficient method of fitting -crystalline PDB crystal
   structure onto its EM model.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Storage of electrical energy generated by variable and diffuse wind and
   solar energy at an acceptable cost would liberate modern society from
   its dependence for energy on the combustion of fossil fuels. This
   perspective attempts to project the extent to which electrochemical
   technologies can achieve this liberation. Realization of a reversible
   plating of a Lithium or Sodium anode through a solid Li+ or Na+
   electrolyte would offer the best solution for a rechargeable battery
   that powers electric vehicles, thereby replacing the internal combustion
   engines that are creating a distributed emission of polluting gases from
   an increasing fleet of automobiles. Removal from the cathode to an
   external store of the product of the chemical reaction on discharge of a
   rechargeable battery can increase the capacity and lower the cost of
   stationary electrical energy storage in a battery. The ability to store
   electrical energy from wind and/or solar energy in rechargeable
   batteries at distributed sites can lower the cost and enhance the
   security of energy availability. The contributions from electrochemical
   capacitors and reversible fuel cells are also considered. (C) 2015

   intracavity difference-frequency generation (DFG) in midinfrared
   (mid-IR) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). A DFG-QCL gain chip employed in
   a Littrow-type THz EC system was optimized for wide tunability in 1-6
   THz range using broad mid-IR gain bandwidth active region with
   integrated optical nonlinearity and Cherenkov THz phase-matching scheme.
   The EC system demonstrated ultrabroadband single-mode tuning from 1.2 to
   5.9 THz. Beam steering in THz far field due to refractive index
   dispersion of InP substrate has been successfully suppressed by bonding
   the QCL chip on a high-resistivity silicon substrate. We also discuss
   the design of compact widely tunable monolithic THz DFG-QCL sources.
   Devices use two electrically isolated grating sections for independent
   electronic tuning of the two mid-IR pump frequencies. THz DFG frequency
   tuning from 3.44 to 4.02 THz, corresponding to 580 GHz or 15\% of center

Abstract = {{A simple approach is introduced to identify and calibrate analytical
   models of multi-story buildings from their vibration records. The method
   is based on the Transfer Matrix formulation of the response, and
   requires that vibration time histories are known at every floor of the
   building. Since this is typically not the case, first a methodology is
   developed to estimate vibration time histories at non-instrumented
   floors of the building from those recorded at the instrumented floors,
   based on the assumption that the mode shapes of a multi-story building
   can be approximated as a linear combination of the mode shapes of a
   shear beam and a bending beam. Once the vibration time histories are
   known at every floor, it is shown by using the Transfer Matrix
   formulation that the top-to-bottom spectral ratio of the records at a
   particular story is dependent only on the properties of this story and
   the stories above. In other words, any change in the characteristics of
   the stories below does not affect the spectral ratio for this story.
   Therefore, starting from the top story, we can identify frequency of
   each story (i.e., story stiffness/story mass), or directly story
   stiffness if the story mass is known. In addition to system
   identification, the approach also provides a simple tool to calibrate
   analytical models of multi-story buildings from their vibration records.}},

Abstract = {{Recent long-term studies showed an unsatisfactory recurrence rate of
   severe mitral regurgitation 3-5 years after surgical repair, suggesting
   that excessive tissue stresses and the resulting strain-induced tissue
   failure are potential etiological factors controlling the success of
   surgical repair for treating mitral valve (MV) diseases. We hypothesized
   that restoring normal MV tissue stresses in MV repair techniques would
   ultimately lead to improved repair durability through the restoration of
   MV normal homeostatic state. Therefore, we developed a micro- and macro-
   anatomically accurate MV finite element model by incorporating actual
   fiber microstructural architecture and a realistic structure-based
   constitutive model. We investigated MV closing behaviors, with extensive
   in vitro data used for validating the proposed model. Comparative and
   parametric studies were conducted to identify essential model fidelity
   and information for achieving desirable accuracy. More importantly, for
   the first time, the interrelationship between the local fiber ensemble
   behavior and the organ-level MV closing behavior was investigated using
   a computational simulation. These novel results indicated not only the
   appropriate parameter ranges, but also the importance of the
   microstructural tuning (i.e., straightening and re-orientation) of the
   collagen/elastin fiber networks at the macroscopic tissue level for
   facilitating the proper coaptation and natural functioning of the MV
   apparatus under physiological loading at the organ level. The proposed
   computational model would serve as a logical first step toward our
   long-term modeling goal-facilitating simulation-guided design of optimal
   surgical repair strategies for treating diseased MVs with significantly
   enhanced durability.}},

Abstract = {{We are concerned with high-fidelity subsurface imaging of the soil,
   which commonly arises in geotechnical site characterization and
   geophysical explorations. Specifically, we attempt to image the spatial
   distribution of the Lame parameters in semi-infinite, three-dimensional,
   arbitrarily heterogeneous formations, using surficial measurements of
   the soil's response to probing elastic waves. We use the complete
   waveform response of the medium to drive the inverse problem, by using a
   partial-differential-equation (PDE)-constrained optimization approach,
   directly in the time-domain, to minimize the misfit between the observed
   response of the medium at select measurement locations, and a computed
   response corresponding to a trial distribution of the Lame parameters.
   We discuss strategies that lend algorithmic robustness to our proposed
   inversion scheme. To limit the computational domain to the size of
   interest, we employ perfectly-matched-layers (PMLs).
   In order to resolve the forward problem, we use a recently developed
   hybrid finite element approach, where a displacement-stress formulation
   for the PML is coupled to a standard displacement-only formulation for
   the interior domain, thus leading to a computationally cost-efficient
   scheme. Time-integration is accomplished by using an explicit
   Runge-Kutta scheme, which is well-suited for large-scale problems on
   parallel computers.
   We verify the accuracy of the material gradients obtained via our
   proposed scheme, and report numerical results demonstrating successful
   reconstruction of the two Lame parameters for both smooth and sharp
   profiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{296}},
Pages = {{73-112}},

Abstract = {{Isogeometric collocation methods have been recently proposed as an
   alternative to standard Galerkin approaches as they provide a
   significant reduction in computational cost for higher-order
   discretizations. In this work, we explore the application of
   isogeometric collocation to large deformation elasticity and frictional
   contact problems. We first derive the non-linear governing equations for
   the elasticity problem with finite deformation kinematics and provide
   details on their consistent linearization. Some numerical examples
   demonstrate the performance of collocation in its basic and enhanced
   versions, differing by the enforcement of Neumann boundary conditions.
   For problems with strong singularities, enhanced collocation is shown to
   outperform basic collocation and to lead to a spatial convergence
   behavior very similar to Galerkin, whereas for weaker or no
   singularities enhanced and basic collocation may give very similar
   results. A large deformation contact formulation is subsequently
   developed and tested in the frictional setting, where collocation
   confirms the excellent performance already obtained for the frictionless
   case. Finally, it is shown that the contact formulation in the
   collocation framework passes the contact patch test to machine precision
   in a three-dimensional setting with arbitrarily inclined non-matching
   discretizations, thus outperforming most of the available contact
   formulations and all those with pointwise enforcement of the contact
   constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of polymer structure on gas transport properties of selected
   aromatic polyimides, polyamides and TR polymers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{493}},
Pages = {{766-781}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Thermally rearranged (TR) polymers are formed through a thermally
   induced solid-state reaction of polyimides or polyamides that contain
   nucleophilic reactive groups ortho-positioned to their diamine.
   Naturally, the transport properties of TR polymers are intimately
   related to the chemical structure and reactivity of their precursors.
   Herein, we report characterization and transport properties for three
   poly (hydroxyimide) precursors prepared via thermal imidization in
   solution and for their corresponding TR polymers. Structural
   modifications to the polymer backbone can be used to control thermal
   rearrangement reaction kinetics. In regards to TR polymer formation,
   samples prepared from diamines with biphenyl functionality reacted more
   efficiently than those prepared from diamines with
   hexa-fluoroisopropylidene-linked aromatic units. However,
   hexafluoroisopropylidene functional units provided the highest
   combinations of permeability and selectivity for separations involving
   H-2, N-2, O-2, CH4, and CO2. Differences in permeability between samples
   correlated well with changes in free volume, and 3 poly(hydroxyimide)s
   showed unusually high selectivities for their given free volume. The
   effect of synthesis route was also investigated for a specific TR
   polymer derived from 3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-biphenyl (HAB) and
   2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA).
   Poly (hydroxyimide) precursors prepared via thermal imidization in
   solution and thermal imidization in the solid-state showed nearly
   identical permeabilities and selectivities regardless of synthesis
   route. However, after thermal rearrangement, the TR polymers prepared
   from polyimides synthesized via solid-state imidization have higher gas
   permeabilities than their solution-imidized analogs. In addition to
   light gas permeabilities, plasticization effects were investigated with
   CO2 hysteresis loops for all samples, and pure gas olefin/paraffin
   permeabilities were determined for a TR polymer derived from
   2,2-bis(3-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl)-hexafluoropropane (APAF) and 6FDA. With
   the exception of HAB-6FDA polymides, pure gas CO2 feed pressures up to
   approximately 50 bar do not reveal a plasticization pressure point, but
   conditioning effects are observed for most samples. APAF-6FDA TR
   polymers have pure gas permeabilities and selectivities beyond the
   propylene/propane upper bound. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery in Bakken tight oil reservoirs}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{354-363}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The combination of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic
   fracturing have boosted the oil production from Bakken tight oil
   reservoirs. However, the primary oil recovery factor is very low due to
   the extremely tight formation, resulting in substantial volumes of oil
   still remaining in place. Hence, it is important to investigate the
   potential of applying enhanced oil recovery methods to increase oil
   recovery in the Bakken formation. Although carbon dioxide (CO2) is
   widely used in conventional reservoirs to improve oil recovery, it is a
   new subject and not well-understood in unconventional oil reservoirs
   such as the Bakken formation. In this paper, we use numerical reservoir
   simulation to model CO2 injection as a huff-n-puff process with typical
   reservoir and fracture properties from the Bakken formation. Effects of
   CO2 molecular diffusion, number of cycle, fracture half-length,
   permeability and reservoir heterogeneity on the well performance of CO2
   huff-n-puff are examined in detail. The results show that the CO2
   diffusion plays a significant role in improving oil recovery from tight
   oil reservoirs, which cannot be neglected in the reservoir simulation
   model. Additionally, the tight oil formation with lower permeability,
   longer fracture half-length, and more heterogeneity is more favorable
   for the CO2 huff-n-puff process. This work can provide a better
   understanding of the physical mechanisms and key parameters affecting
   the effectiveness of CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery in the
   Bakken formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When viewing 3D images, a sense of visual comfort (or lack of) is
   developed in the brain over time as a function of binocular disparity
   and other 3D factors. We have developed a unique temporal visual
   discomfort model (TVDM) that we use to automatically predict the degree
   of discomfort felt when viewing stereoscopic 3D (S3D) images. This model
   is based on physiological mechanisms. In particular, TVDM is defined as
   a second-order system capturing relevant neuronal elements of the visual
   pathway from the eyes and through the brain. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the TVDM transfer function model produces predictions
   that correlate highly with the subjective visual discomfort scores
   contained in the large public databases. The transfer function analysis
   also yields insights into the perceptual processes that yield a stable

Abstract = {{We propose a referenceless perceptual fog density prediction model based
   on natural scene statistics (NSS) and fog aware statistical features.
   The proposed model, called Fog Aware Density Evaluator (FADE), predicts
   the visibility of a foggy scene from a single image without reference to
   a corresponding fog-free image, without dependence on salient objects in
   a scene, without side geographical camera information, without
   estimating a depth-dependent transmission map, and without training on
   human-rated judgments. FADE only makes use of measurable deviations from
   statistical regularities observed in natural foggy and fog-free images.
   Fog aware statistical features that define the perceptual fog density
   index derive from a space domain NSS model and the observed
   characteristics of foggy images. FADE not only predicts perceptual fog
   density for the entire image, but also provides a local fog density
   index for each patch. The predicted fog density using FADE correlates
   well with human judgments of fog density taken in a subjective study on
   a large foggy image database. As applications, FADE not only accurately
   assesses the performance of defogging algorithms designed to enhance the
   visibility of foggy images, but also is well suited for image defogging.
   A new FADE-based referenceless perceptual image defogging, dubbed
   DEnsity of Fog Assessment-based DEfogger (DEFADE) achieves better
   results for darker, denser foggy images as well as on standard foggy
   images than the state of the art defogging methods. A software release
   of FADE and DEFADE is available online for public use:

Abstract = {{In this paper the classical statistical mechanics has been explored in
   order to develop statistical mechanical framework for peridynamics.
   Peridynamic equation of motion is known as upscaled Newton's equation.
   The peridynamic system consists of finite number of nonlocally
   interacting particles at nano and meso scales. This particle
   representation of peridynamics can be treated in terms of classical
   statistical mechanics. Hence, in this work the phase space is
   constructed based on the PD particle from their evolving momentum pi and
   positions xi. The statistical ensembles are derived by defining
   appropriate partition functions. The algorithms for NVE and NPH
   implemented in the classical molecular dynamics are revisited for
   equilibrium peridynamic models. The current work introduces Langevin
   dynamics to the peridynamic theory through fluctuation dissipation
   principle. This introduces a heat bath to the peridynamic system which
   eliminates the ambiguity with the role of temperature in a peridynamic
   system. Finally, it was seen that the homogenization of a peridynamic
   model with finite number of particles approaches to a conventional
   continuum model. The upscaled non-equilibrium peridynamics has potential
   applications in modeling wide variety of multiscale multiphysics
   problems from nano to macro scale or vice versa. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Operation principles and designs of rapidly tunable quantum cascade
   lasers (QCL) were analyzed theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical
   analysis shows that by adding a special polarization transition with
   controllable intensity or energy to existing QCL designs, one can
   achieve emission frequency modulation Delta upsilon approximate to 30
   GHz for the carrier wavelength of 10 mu m, while introducing additional
   optical losses of not more than 10 cm(-1) in the laser waveguide.
   Proof-of-principle electrically tunable QCL demonstrated frequency shift
   of 4.5 GHz. Rapid and continuous frequency tuning of a single-mode
   distributed-feedback quantum cascade laser (DFB QCL) by optical
   generation of electron-hole pairs in the laser waveguide and active area
   was demonstrated. Application of optimized pumping geometry made
   possible to achieve continuous tuning of a room-temperature-operated DFB
   QCL in the range of 0.6 cm(-1) (20 GHz) using 1.3-mu m telecom diode
   laser as a pumping source. The wavelength of the optically tunable DFB
   QCL was modulated at frequencies up to 300 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the fine location of neutralizing and non-neutralizing
   epitopes on human pathogens affords a better understanding of the
   structural basis of antibody efficacy, which will expedite rational
   design of vaccines, prophylactics, and therapeutics. However, full
   utilization of the wealth of information from single cell techniques and
   antibody repertoire sequencing awaits the development of a high
   throughput, inexpensive method to map the conformational epitopes for
   antibody-antigen interactions. Here we show such an approach that
   combines comprehensive mutagenesis, cell surface display, and DNA deep
   sequencing. We develop analytical equations to identify epitope
   positions and show the method effectiveness by mapping the fine epitope
   for different antibodies targeting TNF, pertussis toxin, and the cancer
   target TROP2. In all three cases, the experimentally determined
   conformational epitope was consistent with previous experimental
   datasets, confirming the reliability of the experimental pipeline. Once
   the comprehensive library is generated, fine conformational epitope maps
   can be prepared at a rate of four per day.}},

Abstract = {{We have synthesized Pt-M (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) nanoparticles (NPs) on
   carbon nanotube (CNT) supports (Pt-M/CNT) by one-pot sonochemical
   reactions and investigated their electrocatalytic properties for
   methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with emphases on the effects of
   particle proximity and composition. The NPs are 2-3 nm in size and are
   uniformly distributed on the CNT surfaces. A series of Pt-Mn/CNT samples
   with different Pt loadings (33, 57 and 78 wt \%) allows the study on the
   effects of particle proximity. Since the Mn-contents of these samples
   are very low (<= 8.0 at \%) in the NPs, their properties can be
   approximated as those of `pure' Pt NPs. Their mass MOR currents do not
   show any significant variation, but the specific MOR current increases
   as the distance between NPs is reduced. On the other hand, incorporation
   of larger amounts of transition metals in the NPs appears to be a more
   effective way to enhance the MOR characteristics. Pt-Fe/CNT with
   Fe-content 39.0 at \% and Pt Co/CNT with Co-content 46.6 at \% both with
   high Pt-contents are prepared. They show 2-3 fold enhancement in both
   mass and specific MOR currents compared with commercial Pt/C (60 wt \%).

Abstract = {{Efficient penetration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles (NPs)
   inside solid tissues and tumors is paramount to their therapeutic and
   diagnostic success. While many studies have reported the effect of NP
   size and charge on intratissue distribution, role of shape, and aspect
   ratio on NP transport inside solid tissues remain unclear. Here
   experimental and theoretical studies are reported on how nanoscale
   geometry of Jet and Flash Imprint Lithography-fabricated,
   polyethylene-glycol-based anionic nanohydrogels affect their penetration
   and distribution inside 3D spheroids, a model representing the
   intervascular region of solid, tumor-like tissues. Unexpectedly, low
   aspect ratio cylindrical NPs (H/D approximate to 0.3; disk-like
   particles, 100 nm height, and 325 nm diameter) show maximal intratissue
   delivery (>50\% increase in total cargo delivered) and more uniform
   penetration compared to nanorods or smaller NPs of the same shape. This
   is in contrast to spherical NPs where smaller NP size resulted in
   deeper, more uniform penetration. Our results provide fundamental new
   knowledge on NP transport inside solid tissues and further establish
   shape and aspect ratio as important design parameters in developing more
   efficient, better penetrating, nanocarriers for drug, or contrast-agent
   delivery.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted on a magnetohydrodynamic plasma
   actuator consisting of two parallel, six inch long, copper electrodes
   flush mounted on an insulating ceramic plate. An electrical arc is
   generated by a similar to 1 kA current pulse at similar to 100 V across
   the electrodes. A self-induced Lorentz force drives the arc along the
   electrodes. The motion of the arc induces flow in the surrounding air
   through compression as well as entrainment, and generates a transient
   force, about similar to 4 ms in duration. Experiments were performed on
   a prototype actuator in quiescent atmospheric air to characterize the
   motion of the arc and the momentum transferred to the surrounding air.
   Measurements included transient force and total impulse generated by the
   actuator as well as the armature voltage and current. The arc shape and
   transit velocity were determined by high-speed imaging. A peak force of
   0.4 N imparting an impulse of 0.68 mN-s was measured for a peak current
   of 1.2 kA. The force scaled with the square of the armature current and
   the impulse scaled linearly with the spent capacitor energy. The results
   provide insight into the mechanisms of body force generation and
   momentum transfer of a magnetohydrodynamic plasma actuator.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{In this work, acoustic scattering cancellation is expanded to cases of
   acoustic waves interacting with non-spherical elastic objects and
   collections of closely packed objects. The proposed method for achieving
   this is by using spherical fluid layers to represent the objects as
   effective spherical targets, with multiple fluid layers and an elastic
   core, for which scattering cancellation is used to determine the
   necessary layer properties. Three representative objects are considered
   here to illustrate this approach: a sphere with dimples, a sphere with
   bumps, and a bicone. Theoretical results are presented for each of the
   non-spherical objects in water, which indicate a reduction of 30-40 dB
   in scattering strength when coated with a two-layer fluid cancellation
   shell. This cancellation is achieved for objects in the resonant
   scattering regime, which is characterized by constructive and
   destructive interference patterns that arise from higher scattering
   modes. The analytical results are verified using three-dimensional
   finite element simulations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effective pair interactions between two charged spherical
   particles in polyelectrolyte solutions using polymer self-consistent
   field theory. In a recent study {[}V. Pryamitsyn and V. Ganesan,
   Macromolecules 47, 6095 (2015)], we considered a model in which the
   particles possess fixed charge density, the polymers contain a
   prespecified amount of dissociated charges and, the dielectric constant
   of the solution was assumed to be homogeneous in space and independent
   of the polymer concentration. In this article, we present results
   extending our earlier model to study situations in which either or both
   the particle and the polymers possess partially dissociable groups.
   Additionally, we also consider the case when the dielectric constant of
   the solution depends on the local concentration of the polymers and when
   the particle's dielectric constant is lower than that of the solvent.
   For each case, we quantify the polymer-mediated interactions between the
   particles as a function of the polymer concentrations and the degree of
   dissociation of the polymer and particles. Consistent with the results
   of our previous study, we observe that the polymer-mediated
   interparticle interactions consist of a short-range attraction and a
   long-range repulsion. The partial dissociablity of the polymer and
   particles was seen to have a strong influence on the strength of the
   repulsive portion of the interactions. Rendering the dielectric
   permittivity to be inhomogeneous has an even stronger effect on the
   repulsive interactions and results in changes to the qualitative nature
   of interactions in some parametric ranges. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Oral administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may enable the
   localized treatment of infections or other conditions in the
   gastrointestinal tract (GI) as well as systemic diseases. As with the
   development of oral protein biotherapeutics, one of the most challenging
   tasks in antibody therapies is the loss of biological activity due to
   physical and chemical instabilities. New families of complexation
   hydrogels with pH-responsive properties have demonstrated to be
   excellent transmucosal delivery vehicles. This contribution focuses on
   the design and evaluation of hydrogel carriers that will minimize the
   degradation and, maximize the in vivo activity of anti-TNF-alpha, a mAb
   used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (MD) in the GI
   tract and systemically for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
   P(MAA-g-EG) and P(MAA-co-NVP) hydrogels systems were optimized to
   achieve adequate swelling behavior, which translated into improved
   protein loading and release at neutral pH simulating the small intestine
   conditions. Additionally, these hydrogel systems preserve antibody
   bioactivity upon release resulting in the systemic circulation of an
   antibody capable of effectively performing its biological function. The
   compatibility if these hydrogels for mAb bioactivity preservation and
   release makes them candidates for use as oral delivery systems for
   therapeutic antibodies.}},

Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{The electronic and electrochemical properties of the high-voltage spinel
   LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 as a function of cation ordering and lithium content have
   been investigated. Conductivity and activation energy measurements
   confirm that charge transfer occurs by small polaron hopping and the
   charge carrier conduction is easier in the Ni:3d band than in the in
   Mn:3d band. Seebeck coefficient data reveal that the Ni2+/3+. and
   Ni3+/4+ redox couples are combined in a single,3d band, and that maximum
   charge carrier concentration occurs where the average Ni oxidation state
   is close to 3+, corresponding to x = 0.5 in Li Li1-xMn1.5Ni0.5O4.
   Accordingly, maximum electronic conductivity is found at x = 0.5,
   regardless of cation ordering. The thermodynamically stable phases
   formed during cycling were investigated by recording the X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) of chemically delithiated powders. The more ordered
   spinels maintained two separate two-phase regions upon lithium
   extraction, while the more disordered samples exhibited a
   solid-solubility region from LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 to Li0.5Mn1.5Ni0.5O4. The
   conductivity and phase-transformation data of four samples with varying
   degrees of cation ordering were compared to the electrochemical data
   collected with lithium cells. Only the most ordered spinel showed
   inferior rate performance, while the sample annealed for a shorter time
   performed comparable to the unannealed or disordered samples. The
   results presented here challenge the most common beliefs about
   high-voltage spinel: (i) low Mn3+ content is responsible for poor rate
   performance and (ii) thermodynamically stable solid-solubility is
   critical for fast kinetics.}},

   trials}},
Journal = {{ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: As currently used, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
   Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) has low sensitivity for measuring
   Alzheimer's disease progression in clinical trials. A major reason
   behind the low sensitivity is its sub-optimal scoring methodology, which
   can be improved to obtain better sensitivity.
   Methods: Using item response theory, we developed a new scoring
   methodology (ADAS-CogIRT) for the ADAS-Cog, which addresses several
   major limitations of the current scoring methodology. The sensitivity of
   the ADAS-CogIRT methodology was evaluated using clinical trial
   simulations as well as a negative clinical trial, which had shown an
   evidence of a treatment effect.
   Results: The ADAS-Cog was found to measure impairment in three cognitive
   domains of memory, language, and praxis. The ADAS-CogIRT methodology
   required significantly fewer patients and shorter trial durations as
   compared to the current scoring methodology when both were evaluated in
   simulated clinical trials. When validated on data from a real clinical
   trial, the ADAS-CogIRT methodology had higher sensitivity than the
   current scoring methodology in detecting the treatment effect.
   Conclusions: The proposed scoring methodology significantly improves the
   sensitivity of the ADAS-Cog in measuring progression of cognitive
   impairment in clinical trials focused in the mild-to-moderate
   Alzheimer's disease stage. This provides a boost to the efficiency of
   clinical trials requiring fewer patients and shorter durations for
   investigating disease-modifying treatments.}},

Abstract = {{CaCrO3 is at the crossover from localized to itinerant electronic
   behavior, and interpretation of its electronic state has remained
   controversial. It is a metal from an optical study. However, the
   collinear type-C antiferromagnetic spin ordering below T-N approximate
   to 90K is characteristic of localized electron magnetism. We have
   performed many runs of high-pressure synthesis. CaCrO3 crystals can be
   found in some batches. We have used specific-heat measurement as a
   diagnostic tool to probe the electronic states near the Fermi energy. An
   electronic bandwidth is broadened by applying high pressure. The
   magnetizationmeasurement under pressure reveals a dT(N)/dP < 0. The
   crystal structural change corresponding to the pressure-induced electron
   structural change has been monitored by in situ neutron diffraction
   under high pressure. The t(2)(2) d-electron configuration on octahedral
   site Cr4+ is orbitally threefold degenerate. Local site distortions are
   argued to show that in CaCrO3 the crossover from localized to itinerant
   3d electrons does not result in a charge-density wave in which
   segregation of the interatomic interactions results in the stabilization
   of molecular clusters, but in an intraatomic orbital ordering that
   stabilizes a half-filled localized-electron xy orbital and a 1/4-filled
   c-axis p{*} band. Local structural changes under pressure reveal a
   weakening of long-range magnetic order is associated with a
   smoothMott-Hubbard transition of the xy electrons.}},

Title = {{Gentamicin-induced ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity vary with circadian
   time of treatment and entail separate mechanisms}},

Abstract = {{The aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin can cause both ototoxicity and
   nephrotoxicity, the severity of which varies with circadian time of
   daily treatment. However, it is not yet resolved if such drug-induced
   adverse effects are independent or interdependent phenomena. Two groups
   of 9 female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250g), each housed separately and
   entrained to a 12h light (06:00-18:00h) - 12h dark cycle, received a
   daily subcutaneous injection of 100mg/kg gentamicin. One group was
   treated at the beginning of the activity span, 2 Hours After Lights On
   (HALO), and the other at the beginning of the rest span, 14 HALO. Global
   toxicity was gauged by both body weight loss relative to the
   pre-treatment baseline and number of deaths. Ototoxicity, i.e., hearing
   loss, was assessed by changes in auditory brainstem response (ABR) for
   pure tone stimuli of 8, 16, 24, and 32kHz before and after 2 and 4 weeks
   of gentamicin treatment. Renal toxicity was evaluated by changes in
   urinary N-acetyl--glucosaminidase (NAG)/creatinine (CR) concentration
   ratio before and after each week of treatment. In a complementary
   substudy of separate but comparable 2 and 14 HALO groups of rats, blood
   samples were obtained before and 30, 60, 120, and 240min
   post-subcutaneous injection of 100mg/kg gentamicin. Number of animal
   deaths was greater in the 2 (4 deaths) than 14 HALO (1 death) group,
   mirroring more severe initial (first two weeks of treatment) body weight
   losses from baseline, being more than 2-fold greater in animals of the 2
   than 14 HALO group. Ototoxicity progressively worsened during the
   treatment; although, the extent of hearing loss varied according to
   circadian time of treatment across all frequencies (p<0.05),
   particularly the 24 and 32kHz ones (both p<0.005), both at the 2 and 4
   week assessments. At 32kHz after 4 weeks of gentamicin dosing, the 2
   HALO group showed an average 42dB hearing loss, while the 14 HALO group
   exhibited only an average 10dB loss. ABR response latencies were longer
   for the 2 than 14 HALO rats. The time course of nephrotoxicity differed
   from that of ototoxicity. The mean urinary NAG/CR ratio peaked after the
   first week of treatment, averaging 13.64-fold greater than baseline for
   the 2 HALO-treated animals compared to 7.38-fold greater than baseline
   for the 14 HALO-treated ones. Ratio values declined thereafter;
   although, even after the second week of dosing, they remained greater in
   the 2 than 14 HALO group (averaging 8.15-fold greater and 2.23-fold
   greater than baseline, respectively). Pharmacokinetic analysis of the
   blood gentamicin values revealed slower clearance, on average by similar
   to 25\% (p<0.001), in the rats of the 14 than 2 HALO group (<(x)over
   bar>+/- S.E.: 3.22 +/- 0.49 and 4.53 +/- 0.63mL/min/kg, respectively).
   The study findings indicate robust difference of the time course in rats
   of both treatment groups of gentamicin-induced ototoxicity and
   nephrotoxicity, supporting the hypothesis these organ toxicities are
   independent of one another, and further suggest the observed
   treatment-time differences in gentamicin adverse effects may be more
   dependent on local cell, tissue, or organ circadian (chrono)
   pharmacodynamic than (chrono) pharmacokinetic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{There is immense interest to develop Mg-ion batteries, but finding
   suitable cathode materials has been a challenge. The spinel structure
   has many advantages for ion insertion and has been successfully used in
   Li-ion batteries. We present here findings on the attempts to extract Mg
   from MgMn2O4-based spinels with acid (H2SO4) and with NO2BF4. The acid
   treatment was able to fully remove all Mg from MgMn2O4 by following a
   mechanism involving the disproportionation of Mn3+, and the extraction
   rate decreased with increasing cation disorder. Samples with additional
   Mg2+ ions in the octahedral sites (e.g., Mg1.1Mn1.9O4 and Mg1.5Mn1.5O4)
   also exhibit complete or near complete demagnesiation due to an
   additional mechanism involving ion exchange of Mg2+ by H+, but no Mg
   could be extracted from MgMnAlO4 due to the disruption of MnMn
   interaction/contact across shared octahedral edges. In contrast, no Mg
   could be extracted with the oxidizing agent NO2BF4 from MgMn2O4 or
   Mg1.5Mn1.5O4 as the electrostatic repulsion between the divalent Mg2+
   ions prevents Mg2+ diffusion through the 16c octahedral sites, unlike
   Li+ diffusion, suggesting that spinels may not serve as potential hosts
   for Mg-ion batteries. The ability to extract Mg with acid in contrast to
   that with NO2BF4 is attributed to Mn dissolution from the lattice and
   the consequent reduction in electrostatic repulsion. The findings could
   provide insights toward the design of Mg hosts for Mg-ion batteries.}},

   stronger acoustic transients than dry ablation. Enhanced ablation
   performance resulted possibly from effective coupling of optical energy

   indicate that CaCO3 precipitation occurs during NO3- reduction with a
   maximum saturation index (SIcalcite) of similar to 1.56, but not when
   NO3- was removed, inactive biomass remained, and pH and alkalinity were
   adjusted to SIcalcite similar to 1.56. CaCO3 precipitation was promoted
   by metabolically active cultures of strain DCP-Ps1, which at similar
   values of SIcalcite, have a more negative surface charge than inactive
   strain DCP-Ps1. A two-stage NO3- reduction (NO3- -> NO2- -> N-2)
   pore-scale reactive transport model was used to evaluate denitrification
   kinetics, which was observed in the micromodel as upper (NO3- reduction)
   and lower (NO2- reduction) horizontal zones of biomass growth with CaCO3
   precipitation exclusively in the lower zone. Model results are
   consistent with two biomass growth regions and indicate that
   precipitation occurred in the lower zone because the largest increase in
   pH and alkalinity is associated with NO2- reduction. CaCO3 precipitates
   typically occupied the entire vertical depth of pores and impacted
   porosity, permeability, and flow. This study provides a framework for
   incorporating microbial activity in biogeochemistry models, which often
   base biomineralization only on SI (caused by biotic or abiotic
   reactions) and, thereby, underpredict the extent of this complex
   process. These results have wide-ranging implications for understanding
   reactive transport in relevance to groundwater remediation, CO2
   sequestration, and enhanced oil recovery.}},

   CO-functionalized tip displays dramatically enhanced resolution wherein
   covalent bonds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can be imaged.
   Employing real-space pseudopotential first-principles calculations, we

   calculations allow us to simulate full AFM images and ascertain the
   enhancement mechanism of the CO molecule. We consider two approaches:
   one with an explicit inclusion of the CO molecule and one without. By
   comparing our simulations to existing experimental images, we ascribe
   the enhanced resolution of the CO functionalized tip to the special

Abstract = {{Lithium transition-metal phosphates, LiMPO4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni),
   have attracted significant research interest over the past two decades
   as an important class of lithium ion battery cathode materials. However,
   almost all of the investigations thus far have focused on the olivine
   polymorph that exists in the orthorhombic Pnma space group. In this
   study, a distinct orthorhombic but non-olivine polymorph of LiMPO4,
   described by a Cmcm space group symmetry, has been synthesized with M =
   Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Of these, LiMnPO4 in the Cmcm space group is
   reported for the first time. A rapid microwave-assisted solvothermal
   (MW-ST) heating process with tetraethylene glycol (TEG) as the solvent
   and transition-metal oxalates as precursors facilitates the synthesis of
   these materials. The peak reaction temperatures and pressures were below
   300 degrees C and 30 bar, respectively, which are several orders of
   magnitude lower than those of the previously reported high-pressure
   (gigapascals) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms the crystal
   structure with the Cmcm space group, and scanning electron micrographs
   indicate a submicrometer thin platelet-like morphology. The synthesis
   process conditions have been optimized to obtain impurity-free samples
   with the correct stoichiornetry, as characterized by XRD and inductively
   coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Upon heat
   treatment to higher temperatures, an irreversible transformation of the
   metastable Cmcm polymorphs into olivine is observed by XRD and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy. Although the electrochemical activity
   of these polymorphs as lithium ion cathodes turns out to be poor, the
   facile synthesis under mild conditions has permitted easy access to
   these materials in a nanomorphology, some of which were not even
   possible before.}},

Title = {{Time-stepping approach for solving upper-bound problems: Application to
   two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{An alternative computational procedure for numerically solving a class
   of variational problems arising from rigorous upper-bound analysis of
   forced-dissipative infinite-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems,
   including the Navier-Stokes and Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations, is
   analyzed and applied to Rayleigh-Benard convection. A proof that the
   only steady state to which this numerical algorithm can converge is the
   required global optimal of the relevant variational problem is given for
   three canonical flow configurations. In contrast with most other
   numerical schemes for computing the optimal bounds on transported
   quantities (e.g., heat or momentum) within the ``background field{''}
   variational framework, which employ variants of Newton's method and
   hence require very accurate initial iterates, the new computational
   method is easy to implement and, crucially, does not require numerical
   continuation. The algorithm is used to determine the optimal
   background-method bound on the heat transport enhancement factor, i.e.,
   the Nusselt number (Nu), as a function of the Rayleigh number (Ra),
   Prandtl number (Pr), and domain aspect ratio L in two-dimensional
   Rayleigh-Benard convection between stress-free isothermal boundaries
   (Rayleigh's original 1916 model of convection). The result of the
   computation is significant because analyses, laboratory experiments, and
   numerical simulations have suggested a range of exponents alpha and beta
   in the presumed Nu similar to (PrRa beta)-Ra-alpha scaling relation. The
   computations clearly show that for Ra <= 10(10) at fixed L = 2 root 2,
   Nu <= 0.106Pr(0)Ra(5/12), which indicates that molecular transport
   cannot generally be neglected in the ``ultimate{''} high-Ra regime.}},

Abstract = {{Combined heat and power (CHP) facilities are a very promising path to
   reducing CO2 emissions and increasing efficiency in the power generation
   sector. The ability to supply essential residential utilities
   (electricity, cooling, and heating) in an efficient manner opens the way
   for combining district cooling, heating and power generation, and
   suggests that CHP plants are an attractive choice for providing
   integrated utilities for the neighborhood of the future. In this paper,
   we describe the optimal integration of a CHP plant as a utility producer
   for a residential district, and the potential for combining CHP with
   photovoltaic power generation. Utilizing residential energy demand data
   collected by Pecan Street Research Inc., a smart-grid demonstration
   project in Austin, TX, residential heating, cooling, and electricity
   demand are analyzed and evaluated. These demands are then used to
   compute an optimal operating strateky for an integrated CHP/solar
   utility and the impact of photovoltaic generation on plant operation and
   operating profit is determined. We demonstrate that CHP is a viable
   means for providing district-level cooling, heating, and power to a
   residential district in a hot climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{47-54}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the findings from a study conducted to evaluate the
   potential impact of different types of rock asphalts on performance of
   asphalt composites. Fine aggregate matrix (FAM) mixtures were prepared
   by incorporating three different types of rock asphalts - Buton, QC and
   UM for this study. The methodology used in this study avoided the
   extraction of asphalt binder from rock asphalt and simplified the
   process of evaluating the potential impact of rock asphalts on mixture
   performance. Rheological properties were measured using
   frequency-temperature sweep tests with a dynamic shear rheometer and
   creep-relaxation tests with a bending beam rheometer. Tensile strengths
   of the composites at low temperatures were also measured by applying
   monotonically increasing deflection. The critical cracking temperatures
   were computed using a hypothetical cooling rate for the purposes of
   comparing material durability. Results from this study demonstrated that
   addition of rock asphalts increases material stiffness and slightly
   reduces relaxation potential of asphalt composites at low temperatures.
   A comparison of properties before and after long-term aging also
   revealed a slightly lower rate of aging for mixtures modified with rock
   asphalt as compared to the control mix. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{299}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we consider the application of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
   solutions to open channel flow problems, governed by two-dimensional
   shallow water equations (SWE), with solid curved wall boundaries on
   which the no-normal flow boundary conditions are prescribed. A commonly
   used approach consists of straightforwardly imposing the no-normal flow
   condition on the linear approximation of curved walls. Numerical
   solutions indicate clearly that this approach could lead to unfavorable
   results and that a proper treatment of the no-normal flow condition on
   curved walls is crucial for an accurate DG solution to the SWE. In the
   test case used, errors introduced through the commonly used approach
   result in artificial boundary layers of one-grid-size thickness in the
   velocity field and a corresponding over-prediction of the surface
   elevation in the upstream direction. These significant inaccuracies,
   which render the coarse mesh solution unreliable, appear in all DG
   schemes employed including those using linear, quadratic, and cubic DG
   polynomials. The issue can be alleviated by either using an approach
   accounting for errors introduced by the geometric approximation or an
   approach that accurately represents the geometry. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of low salinity water injection
   (LSWI) on both oil displacement and volumetric sweep efficiencies. A new
   definition of mobility ratio is proposed and shown to correlate with
   volumetric sweep efficiency better than other definitions in the
   literature. A quarter 5-spot field model was created by upscaling
   recently published coreflood experiments. Simulations were performed
   using the Empirical LSWI Model implemented in the UTCHEM simulator.
   Results showed an improved estimation of volumetric sweep efficiency
   with the proposed mobility ratio definition, which applies in the
   tertiary mode and physically makes more sense compared to other
   definitions in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary innovations that enable organisms to colonize new
   ecological niches are rare compared to gradual evolutionary changes in
   existing traits. We discovered that key mutations in the gltA gene,
   which encodes citrate synthase (CS), occurred both before and after
   Escherichia coli gained the ability to grow aerobically on citrate
   (Cit(+) phenotype) during the Lenski long-term evolution experiment. The
   first gltA mutation, which increases CS activity by disrupting
   NADH-inhibition of this enzyme, is beneficial for growth on the acetate
   and contributed to preserving the rudimentary Cit(+) trait from
   extinction when it first evolved. However, after Cit(+) was refined by
   further mutations, this potentiating gltA mutation became deleterious to
   fitness. A second wave of beneficial gltA mutations then evolved that
   reduced CS activity to below the ancestral level. Thus, dynamic
   reorganization of central metabolism made colonizing this new nutrient
   niche contingent on both co-opting and overcoming a history of prior
   adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we demonstrate a solution-based method for a one-step
   deposition and surface passivation of the as-grown silicon nanowires (Si
   NWs). Using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a mild oxidizing agent, the

   from 1 x 10(13) cm(-2) in pristine NWs to 3.7 X 10(10) cm-2 in
   DMF-treated NWs, leading to a dramatic hysteresis reduction in NW
   field-effect transistors (FETs) from up to 32 V to a near-zero
   hysteresis. The change of the polyphenylsilane NW shell stoichiometric
   composition was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis
   showing a 35\% increase in fully oxidized Si4+ species for DMF-treated
   NWs compared to dry NW powder. Additionally, a shell oxidation effect
   induced by DMF resulted is a more stable NW FET performance with steady
   transistor currents and only 1.5 V hysteresis after 1000 h of air
   exposure.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates a ternary nanocomposite system, composed of
   polypropylene (PP), redoped PANI (r-PANI) nanofibers, and reduced
   graphene oxides (RGOs), for use in a high energy density capacitor.
   r-PANI nanofibers were fabricated by the combination methods of chemical
   oxidation polymerization and secondary doping processes, resulting in
   higher conductivity (sigma approximate to 156 S cm(-1)) than that of the
   primarily doped PANI nanofibers (sigma approximate to 16 S cm(-1)). RGO
   sheets with high electron mobility and thermal stability can enhance the
   conductivity of r-PANI/RGO (sigma approximate to 220 S cm(-1)) and
   thermal stability of PP matrix. These findings could be extended to
   combine the advantages of r-PANI nanofibers and RGO sheets for
   developing an efficient means of preparing PP/r-PANI/RGO nanocomposite.
   When the r-PANI/RGO cofillers (10 vol \%) were added to PP matrix, the
   resulting PP/r-PANI/RGO nanocomposite exhibited high dielectric constant
   (epsilon' approximate to 51.8) with small dielectric loss (epsilon `'
   approximate to 9.3 x 10(-3)). Furthermore, the PP/r-PANI/RGO
   nanocomposite was used for an energy-harvesting device, which
   demonstrated high energy density (U-e approximate to 12.6 J cm(-3)) and
   breakdown strength (E approximate to 5.86 x 10(3) kV cm(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal nanocrystal frameworks (CNFs) are a modular class of
   mesostructured porous materials, which are assembled from pre-formed
   nanocrystal building units using suitably designed block copolymer
   architecture-directing agents. The functional attributes of these
   frameworks are determined both by the physiochemical characteristics of
   the nanocrystal components as well as their ordered arrangements in
   space. It is noteworthy that their assembly schemes are readily amenable
   to more than one type of framework component, yielding a multivariate
   landscape to navigate mesoscale phenomena arising from the coupled
   interactions of different nanocrystals within the framework. Early
   reports indicate surprisingly efficient propagation of both matter and
   energy within and along the surfaces of these frameworks, although there
   remains much to be learned about the origins of their structural,
   electronic, and dynamic properties, and how they feed back across
   multiple length and time scales.}},

Abstract = {{LiVOPO4 is an attractive cathode for lithium-ion batteries with a high
   operating voltage and the potential to achieve the reversible insertion
   of two lithium ions between VOPO4 and Li2VOPO4. Among the three known
   forms of LiVOPO4 (alpha, beta, and alpha(I)), the alpha(I)-LiVOPO4 has a
   layered structure that could promote better ionic mobility and
   reversibility than others. However, a comprehensive study of its
   lithiated product is not available as alpha(I)-LiVOPO4 is metastable and
   difficult to prepare by conventional approaches. We present here a
   facile synthesis of highly crystalline alpha(I)-LiVOPO4 and
   alpha(I)-LiVOPO4/rGO nanocomposite by a microwave-assisted solvothermal
   method and its electrochemical/chemical lithiation. The LiVOPO4/rGO
   cathodes exhibit a high reversible capacity of 225 mAh g(-1), indicating
   the insertion of more than one lithium into VOPO4. Both electrochemical
   and chemical lithiation imply a solid-solution reaction mechanism on
   inserting the second lithium into alpha(I)-LiVOPO4, but a two-phase
   reaction feature could also occur under certain conditions such as
   insufficient time for equilibration of Li+ diffusion in the structure.
   The fully lithiated new alpha(I)-Li2VOPO4 phase was characterized by
   combined Rietveld refinement of neutron diffraction and X-ray
   diffraction data and by bond-valence sum maps. The results suggest that
   alpha(I)-Li2VOPO4 retains the tetragonal P4/nmm symmetry of the parent
   alpha(I)-LiVOPO4 structure, where the second lithium ions are located in
   the lithium layers rather than in the VOPO4 layers.}},

Title = {{Bioinspired Catecholic Flame Retardant Nanocoating for Flexible

Abstract = {{An efficient, environmentally friendly, and water-applied flame
   retardant surface nanocoating based on polydopamine (PDA) was developed
   for foamed materials such as polyurethane (PU). The PDA nanocoating,
   deposited by simple dip-coating in an aqueous dopamine solution,
   consists of a planar sublayer and a secondary granular layer structure
   that evolve together, eventually turning into a dense, uniform, and
   conformal layer on all foam surfaces. In contrast to flexible PU foams
   that are known to be highly flammable without flame retardant additives,
   micro combustion calorimetry (MCC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   confirm that the neat PDA is relatively inflammable with a strong
   tendency to form carbonaceous, porous char that is highly advantageous
   for flame retardancy. By depositing nano coatings of PDA onto flexible
   PU foams, the flammability of the PU foam was significantly reduced with
   increasing coating thickness. For the thickest coating (3 days of PDA
   deposition), the foam quickly self-extinguished and its original shape
   was completely preserved after exposure to a flame in a torch burn test.
   In addition to the char forming ability of PDA, it is hypothesized that
   its catechol units likely scavenge nearby radicals that typically evolve
   additional fuel for the fire as they attack surrounding materials. This
   multiple flame retardancy action of PDA (i.e., char formation + radical
   scavenging) enables flame retardant foams with a peak heat release rate
   (P-HRR) that is significantly reduced (up to 67\%) relative to control
   foams, representing much better performance than many conventional
   additives reported in the literature at comparable or higher loadings.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new method for the determination of reactivity ratios based
   on a nonterminal model of copolymerization kinetics. Within the context
   of this model, we derive simple, reactivity-ratio-dependent expressions
   whose solution relies solely on monomer consumption information spanning
   the full range of conversion. Utilizing this method, reactivity ratios
   are obtained for the aluminum chelate-catalyzed copolymerization of
   phenyl glycidyl ether and allyl glycidyl ether (r(PGE) = 1.56 +/- 0.01
   and r(AGE) = 0.66 +/- 0.03) with monomer consumption monitored by in
   situ H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Additionally, this approach is applied to
   experimental data extracted from the literature for other
   copolymerization systems encompassing a range of monomer types
   (styrenics, isoprene, lactones, lactide, and other cyclic ethers) and
   polymerization type (anionic, coordination, and zwitterionic) to obtain
   reactivity ratios under the mechanistic assumption of nonterminal model
   copolymerization kinetics. We present the nonterminal model of
   copolymerization as the first method that should be utilized before more
   complex frameworks (e.g., terminal or penultimate model of chain
   copolymerization) are used to understand copolymerization kinetics.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{In a pressure-temperature (P-T) diagram for synthesizing IrTe2
   compounds, the well-studied trigonal (H) phase with the CdI2-type
   structure is stable at low pressures. The superconducting cubic (C)
   phase can be synthesized under higher temperatures and pressures. A
   rhombohedral phase with the crystal structure similar to the C phase can
   be made at ambient pressure; but the phase contains a high concentration
   of Ir deficiency. In this paper we report that a rarely studied
   monoclinic (M) phase can be stabilized in narrow ranges of pressure and
   temperature in this P-T diagram. The peculiar crystal structure of the
   M-IrTe2 eliminates the tendency to form Ir-Ir dimers found in the H
   phase. The M phase has been fully characterized by structural
   determination and measurements of electrical resistivity, thermoelectric
   power, DC magnetization, and specific heat. These physical properties
   have been compared with those in the H and C phases of Ir1-x Te-2.
   Moreover, magnetic and transport properties and specific heat of the
   M-IrTe2 can be fully justified by calculations with the
   density-functional theory presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that self-centering steel plate shear walls
   (SC-SPSWs) are capable of achieving enhanced seismic performance at
   multiple hazard levels, including recentering following design-level
   earthquakes. When modeling SC-SPSWs numerically, these studies
   considered an idealized tension-only steel plate shear wall (SPSW) web
   plate behavior. Research has shown that web plate behavior is more
   complex than predicted by the idealized model, and web plates can
   provide more strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation than predicted
   by the idealized model. The idealized model of web plate behavior is
   used widely in SPSW numerical models where the moment-resisting boundary
   frame provides supplemental hysteretic damping and stiffness; however,
   in SC-SPSWs, where the post-tensioned boundary frame is designed to
   remain elastic during an earthquake, accounting for the more complex web
   plate behavior can have a significant impact on seismic performance
   estimates from numerical simulation. This paper presents different
   methods for modeling SC-SPSWs. Responses from these models are compared
   with experimental results. A simple modification of the tension-only
   model, referred to as the tension-compression strip model, is shown to
   provide a reasonable approximation of SC-SPSW behavior. Results from
   nonlinear response history analyses of SC-SPSWs with the tension-only
   and tension-compression web plate models are compared to assess how the
   approximation of web plate behavior affects SC-SPSW seismic performance.

Abstract = {{Determining the interaction and solvation structure of molecules with
   solvents near a surface is of fundamental importance for understanding
   electro- and photochemical processes. Here we used scanning tunneling
   microscopy (STM) to investigate the adsorption and solvation structure
   of ammonia on water monolayers on Pt(111). We found that at low coverage
   NH3 binds preferentially to H2O molecules that are slightly elevated
   from the surface and weakly bound to the metal. Density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations showed that as the NH3 molecule descends onto
   the water adlayer a high-lying water molecule reorients with zero energy
   barrier to expose a dangling OH ligand to H-bond NH3. We also found that
   NH3 prefers to bind to the metal substrate when water only partially
   covers the surface, indicating that NH3 is more strongly attracted to
   the metal than to H2O. In addition to this solvation interaction, a
   proton transfer reaction occurs as revealed by reflection-absorption
   infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), leading to the formation of ammonium ions
   (NH4+) in addition to molecularly adsorbed NH3.}},

Abstract = {{A mild and environmental-friendly method is developed for fabricating a
   3D interconnected graphene electrode with large-scale continuity. Such
   material has interlayer pores between reduced graphene oxide nanosheets
   and in-plane pores. Hence, a specific surface area up to 835 m(2) g(-1)
   and a high powder conductivity up to 400 S m(-1) are achieved. For
   electrochemical applications, the interlayer pores can serve as
   ``ionbuffering reservoirs{''} while in-plane ones act as ``channels{''}
   for shortening the mass cross-plane diffusion length, reducing the ion
   response time, and prevent the interlayer restacking. As binder-free
   supercapacitor electrode, it delivers a specific capacitance up to 169 F
   g(-1) with surface-normalized capacitance close to 21 mu F cm(-2)
   (intrinsic capacitance) and power density up to 7.5 kW kg(-1), in 6 M
   KOH aqueous electrolyte. In the case of lithium-ion battery anode, it
   shows remarkable advantages in terms of the initiate reversible
   Coulombic efficiency (61.3\%), high specific capacity (932 mAh g(-1) at
   100 mA g(-1)), and robust long-term retention (93.5\% after 600 cycles
   at 2000 mAh g(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we establish a connection between process integration and
   process intensification. Focusing on processes with material recycle, we
   use an asymptotic analysis to demonstrate that intensification
   represents a limit case of tight integration through significant
   material recycling. Based on this result, we propose a novel avenue for
   discovering intensification opportunities at the process design stage.
   Subsequently, we investigate the dynamics and control implications of
   the transition from process integration to process intensification. We
   demonstrate that, for the same steady-state performance, the dynamic
   response of an integrated process is slower than that of its intensified
   equivalent. Also, we provide a theoretical justification for existing
   empirical arguments concerning the loss of control degrees of freedom
   caused by process intensification. The theoretical developments are
   applied on a reaction-separation-recycle process example. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Autothermal microchannel reactors are intensified process units that
   bring significant energy efficiency benefits over their conventional
   counterparts. Efficiency gains are obtained, however, at the cost of
   operational challenges. These stem from the loss of control handles that
   is inherent to combining several unit operations in a single physical
   device. In this paper, we investigate the impact of two recently
   proposed reactor design concepts (a segmented catalyst macromorphology
   and an embedded layer of phase change material) aimed at improving the
   steady state energy distribution and, respectively, preventing the
   advent of hotspots during transient operation, on reactor dynamics and
   control. Using an autothermal microchannel reactor coupling steam
   methane reforming with methane catalytic combustion as a prototype
   system, we demonstrate through rigorous simulations that these design
   innovations have a synergistic effect, resulting in superior
   steady-state performance and excellent disturbance rejection ability.

Abstract = {{A novel Eulerian network model that incorporates ``shear dispersion,''

   is equivalent to performing network-wide time convolutions of elementary
   throat response functions. Predicted macroscopic longitudinal dispersion
   coefficients for disordered sphere packs are in good agreement with
   published experimental data. We further investigate the impact of mixing
   assumptions within pores on macroscopic longitudinal dispersion and find
   the dependence to be weak for disordered sphere packs. Limitations of
   Eulerian network models as a whole are also discussed, and their
   inappropriateness for ordered porous media concluded.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new approach for the synthesis ofMarkov chains
   with density safety constraints. Specific safety constraints considered
   are: (i) Density upper bound constraints; (ii) Bound on the rate of
   change of density. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical
   result that formulates these constraints as linear, and hence convex,
   inequality constraints. The main contribution of the paper is that the
   new convex constraints are proved to be equivalent, necessary and
   sufficient, to the original constraints. This result enables the
   formulation of the Markov chain synthesis problem as a Linear Matrix
   Inequality (LMI) optimization problem with additional constraints on the
   steady state probability distribution, ergodicity, and feasible state
   transitions. The LMI formulation presents a necessary and sufficient
   design condition for reversible Markov chains, that is, it is not
   conservative. When the reversibility is not required, the LMI condition
   is only sufficient due to the ergodicity constraint. Since LMI problems
   can be solved to global optimality in polynomial time by using Interior
   Point Method algorithms, the proposed LMI-based design approach is
   numerically tractable.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a one-dimensional analytical solution based on the method of
   characteristics to explore hydrate formation from gas injection into
   brine-saturated sediments within the hydrate stability zone. Our
   solution includes fully coupled multiphase and multicomponent flow and
   the associated advective transport in a homogeneous system. Our solution
   shows that hydrate saturation is controlled by the initial thermodynamic
   state of the system and changed by the gas fractional flow. Hydrate
   saturation in gas-rich systems can be estimated by 1- cl(0)/cl(e) when
   Darcy flow dominates, where cl(0) is the initial mass fraction of salt
   in brine, and cl(e) is the mass fraction of salt in brine at three-phase
   (gas, liquid, and hydrate) equilibrium. Hydrate saturation is constant,
   gas saturation and gas flux decrease, and liquid saturation and liquid
   flux increase with the distance from the gas inlet to the hydrate
   solidification front. The total gas and liquid flux is constant from the
   gas inlet to the hydrate solidification front and decreases abruptly at
   the hydrate solidification front due to gas inclusion into the hydrate
   phase. The advancing velocity of the hydrate solidification front
   decreases with hydrate saturation at a fixed gas inflow rate. This
   analytical solution illuminates how hydrate is formed by gas injection
   (methane, CO2, ethane, propane) at both the laboratory and field scales.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer shrinkage from curing in nanoimprint lithography (NIL) strongly
   affects the ultimate shapes of two- and three-dimensional structures
   produced following etching. We computationally study the curing step in
   the NIL process and predict the shape changes caused by polymer
   shrinkage. The shape changes are predicted for crosses, diamonds with
   sharp and rounded tips, and multitiered structures that are applicable
   for multibit memory devices and dual damascene processes. The shape
   changes from curing are shown to be governed by the shrinkage
   coefficient of the polymer resist, its Poisson's ratio, and the
   geometric aspect ratios of the shapes. Finite element simulations
   demonstrate that shape change due to polymer densification is equal to
   the average volumetric contraction of the resist material, but shrinkage
   is not isotropic and vertical displacement dominates. The thickness of
   the residual layer does not impact the final profile of the imprinted
   shapes considered. Further analysis shows that diamonds with sharp tips
   stay sharp while the tips of rounded diamonds get sharper. Additionally,
   shape changes for multitiered structures are not uniformly distributed
   among the tiers. Using etch simulations, we demonstrate the significant
   impact of polymer shrinkage on the final feature profile. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Accurately modeling and predicting the visual attention behavior of
   human viewers can help a video analysis algorithm find interesting
   regions by reducing the search effort of tasks, such as object detection
   and recognition. In recent years, a great number and variety of visual
   attention models for predicting the direction of gaze on images and
   videos have been proposed. When a human views video, the motions of both
   objects in the video and of the camera greatly affect the distribution
   of visual fixations. Here we develop models that lead to motion features
   that are extracted from videos and used in a new video saliency
   detection method called spatial-temporal weighted dissimilarity (STWD).
   To achieve efficiency, frames are partitioned into blocks on which
   saliency calculations are made. Two spatial features are defined on each
   block, termed spatial dissimilarity and preference difference, which are
   used to characterize the spatial conspicuity of each block. The motion
   features extracted from each block are simple differences of motion
   vectors between adjacent frames. Finally, the spatial and motion
   features are used to generate a saliency map on each frame. Experiments
   on three public video datasets containing 185 video clips and
   corresponding eye traces revealed that the proposed saliency detection
   method is highly competitive with, and delivers better performance than
   state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Rheology of polymer-free foam fracturing fluids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{87-96}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aqueous polymeric solutions are commonly used for fracturing in
   conventional petroleum reservoirs for their ability to transport
   proppants deep into fractures, but such fluids are not used for shale
   reservoirs because of the plugging of nano-pores of shales by large
   polymer molecules. Polymer-free aqueous foams can be used in shale
   fracturing because of their capacity to suspend proppants and lower
   water consumption than commonly used water-based fracturing fluids. In
   this work, the rheology of three kinds of polymer-free foams (A: 0.5
   wt\% regular anionic surfactant, B: Fluid A+2 wt\% glycerol, C: 0.5 wt\%
   viscoelastic surfactant or VES) are studied in a recirculating pipe
   rheometer up to 155 degrees F and 2000 psi. These temperature and
   pressure conditions are lower than those for typical shales of current
   interest. All three foams exhibit power-law rheological behavior. The
   regular surfactant foams (A and B) show shear thinning behavior at
   qualities above 60\%, non-shear dependent behavior from 50\% to 60\% and
   shear thickening below 50\% (due to turbulence). The VES foams show
   shear thinning at qualities less than 60\%. Temperature lowers the
   viscosity of foams by decreasing the liquid phase viscosity and the
   stability of the bubbles, but the temperature effect is small for foams
   A and B. Pressure increases foam viscosity; the increase is higher for
   higher quality foams. As the pressure increases, the rate of viscosity
   increase decreases. The aqueous foams A and B are both less viscous than
   typical guar foams (0.24 wt\% polymer), while the VES foam C has a
   similar viscosity. The model proposed by Brouwers (2010) for suspensions
   agrees the best with the measured data for quality under 60\%; the model
   proposed by Princen and Kiss (1989) for high quality does not match the
   experimental data New correlations have been developed to describe the
   aqueous foam rheology as a function of shear rate, quality, and pressure
   at the parameter range typical of hydraulic fracturing. The correlations
   can be incorporated in a fracture propagation simulator to evaluate the
   foam fracturing efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{186-198}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Common practice in industry is to obtain geopressures from indirect
   methods applied to data obtained from seismic or electrical logs.
   Because the diffusivity equation describes the pore pressure behavior of
   a saturated porous media, in this work, it is being used as the basis to
   attempt a solution to estimate pore pressure in producing formations and
   above them, in the overburden. Formation properties captured through
   well logging in offset wells are introduced to our solution of the
   diffusivity equation as ``normalized values{''} to estimate pore
   pressures. For a traditional pore pressure assessment, as it is proposed
   in this work, the problem is set to a time frame. The resulting boundary
   value problem is solved by applying a ``non-strict inverse approach{''}
   until a satisfying solution is found. Pressure data from offset wells
   are used as calibration parameters to obtain the pore pressure
   distribution along depth of investigation. To prove effectiveness and
   accuracy of our novel technique, results from real data in conventional
   and complex geological basins are discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The heat transport capacity of the conventional heat pipes over extended
   distances is limited by the maximum condensate flow that their wicks can
   sustain. This paper introduces and analyzes a new planar heat pipe
   technology, which can transport ultrahigh heat loads (>1 kW) over
   extended distances (>1 m). The concept of an electrowetting heat pipe
   (EHP) is based on replacing the adiabatic wick section of a conventional
   heat pipe with EW-based pumping. EW is a well-developed fluid handling
   technique to carry out various microfluidic operations, such as droplet
   pumping, and is based on the electrical modulation of surface tension.
   The EHP relies on EW pumping of the condensate to the evaporator in the
   form of discrete droplets. EHPs are not subject to the capillary limit
   on heat transport capacity. The first-order models predict that EHPs
   with a cross section footprint of 10 cm x 4 mm (width x thickness) can
   transport 1.5 kW over extended distances (>1 m) using water as the
   working fluid. Other benefits include ultralow power consumption
   (microwatts), opportunities for active control of heat pipes, selection
   of a wide range of working fluids, and the absence of moving parts. The
   heat transport capacity and the thermal resistance of an EHP are
   compared with four other devices of similar dimensions: 1) a sintered
   powder heat pipe; 2) an axial groove heat pipe; 3) a loop heat pipe; and
   4) a thermosyphon. The EHP can transport more than twice the maximum
   heat capacity of other devices while offering a low thermal resistance
   of 0.01 K/W. Thus, EW is an enabling technology for the development of
   long, high-capacity heat pipes.}},

Volume = {{529}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanisms of filtration through porous media is
   relevant in many engineering applications ranging from waste water
   treatment and aquifer contamination in environmental engineering to
   estimating the permeability reduction in near wellbore region during
   drilling or water re-injection in petroleum engineering. In this paper
   we present a pore-scale approach that models straining through the pore
   structures extracted from X-ray tomographic images of rock and grain
   pack samples from the first principles, enabling the examination of
   current macroscopic models. While continuum models are widely used for
   fast prediction of the retention profiles and permeability of the host
   porous medium, they require a number of phenomenological parameters
   which are derived from matching experimental results. One of these
   parameters is the rate of entrapment, which is the sink term in the
   advection-diffusion equation. Here we find the constitutive relationship
   for the rate of entrapment as a product of the filtration coefficient,
   velocity, and concentration and validate it by comparing with core flood
   experiments. Results show that the pore-scale simulation gives close
   approximations of filtration coefficient when pore bridging and
   straining are the main particle capture mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Topological insulators do not allow conduction in the bulk, yet they
   support edge modes that travel along the boundary only in one direction,
   determined by the carried electron spin, with inherent robustness to
   defects and disorder. Topological insulators have inspired analogues in
   photonics and optics, in which one-way edge propagation in topologically
   protected two-dimensional materials is achieved breaking time-reversal
   symmetry with a magnetic bias. Here, we introduce the concept of
   topological order in classical acoustics, realizing robust topological
   protection and one-way edge propagation of sound in a suitably designed
   resonator lattice biased with angular momentum, forming the acoustic
   analogue of a magnetically biased graphene layer. Extending the concept
   of an acoustic nonreciprocal circulator based on angular-momentum bias,
   time-reversal symmetry is broken here using moderate rotational motion
   of air within each element of the lattice, which takes the role of the
   electron spin in determining the direction of modal edge propagation.}},

Title = {{PF2 fit: Polar Fast Fourier Matched Alignment of Atomistic Structures
   with 3D Electron Microscopy Maps}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{There continue to be increasing occurrences of both atomistic structure
   models in the PDB (possibly reconstructed from X-ray diffraction or NMR
   data), and 3D reconstructed cryoelectron microscopy (3D EM) maps (albeit
   at coarser resolution) of the same or homologous molecule or molecular
   assembly, deposited in the EMDB. To obtain the best possible structural
   model of the molecule at the best achievable resolution, and without any
   missing gaps, one typically aligns (match and fits) the atomistic
   structure model with the 3D EM map. We discuss a new algorithm and
   generalized framework, named PF2 fit (Polar Fast Fourier Fitting) for
   the best possible structural alignment of atomistic structures with 3D
   EM. While PF2 fit enables only a rigid, six dimensional (6D) alignment
   method, it augments prior work on 6D X-ray structure and 3D EM alignment
   in multiple ways:
   Scoring. PF2 fit includes a new scoring scheme that, in addition to
   rewarding overlaps between the volumes occupied by the atomistic
   structure and 3D EM map, rewards overlaps between the volumes
   complementary to them. We quantitatively demonstrate how this new
   complementary scoring scheme improves upon existing approaches. PF2 fit
   also includes two scoring functions, the non-uniform exterior penalty
   and the skeleton-secondary structure score, and implements the
   scattering potential score as an alternative to traditional Gaussian
   blurring.
   Search. PF2 fit utilizes a fast polar Fourier search scheme, whose main
   advantage is the ability to search over uniformly and adaptively sampled
   subsets of the space of rigid-body motions. PF2 fit also implements a
   new reranking search and scoring methodology that considerably improves
   alignment metrics in results obtained from the initial search.}},

Title = {{Crosswell Magnetic Sensing of Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles for
   Subsurface Applications}},

Abstract = {{Stable dispersions of superparamagnetic nanoparticles that are already
   in use in biomedicine as image-enhancing agents also have potential use
   in subsurface applications. Surface-coated nanoparticles are capable of
   flowing through micron-sized pores across long distances in a reservoir,
   with modest retention in rock. These particles change the magnetic
   permeability of the flooded region, and thus one can use them to enhance
   images of the flood. In this paper, we model the propagation of a
   ``ferrofluid{''} slug in a reservoir and its response to a crosswell
   magnetic tomography system.
   This approach to monitoring fluid movement within a reservoir is built
   on established electromagnetic (EM) conductivity-monitoring technology.
   In this work, however, we investigate the contrast between injected and
   resident fluids when they have different magnetic permeabilities.
   Specifically, we highlight the magnetic response at low frequency to the
   magnetic excitations generated by a vertical magnetic dipole source
   positioned at the injection well. At these frequencies, the induction
   effect is small, the casing effect is manageable, the crosswell response
   originates purely from the magnetic contrast in the formation, and
   changes in fluid conductivities are irrelevant.
   The sensitivity of the measurements to the magnetic slug is highest when
   the slug is closest to the source or receivers and lower when the slug
   is midway in the interwell region. At low frequencies, the magnetic
   response of the ferrofluid slug is largely independent of frequency. As
   expected for the conductive slug, the sensitivity of the inductive
   measurements is negligible at low frequencies whereas significant levels
   of detectability result at higher frequencies. We demonstrate
   sensitivity to the vertical boundaries of the slug by shifting the
   vertical position of the excitation source relative to the magnetic
   slug. The slug geometry plays a key role in determining the magnetic
   response. With a fixed volume of ferrofluid, there is an optimum slug
   geometry that results in the maximum magnetic response. Hydrodynamic
   dispersion of the slug has negligible effect on the magnetic response
   during early stages of the waterflood. As the slug travels farther into
   the formation, however, dispersion reduces the concentration of
   nanoparticles, and the spatial contributions of the magnetic
   measurements are more diffuse. We illustrate how these low-frequency
   excitation behaviors are consistent with the quasistatic magnetic dipole
   physics. The fact that the progress of the magnetic slug can be detected
   at very early stages of the flood, that the traveling slug's vertical
   boundaries can be identified at low frequencies, and that the magnetic
   nanoparticles can be sensed well before the actual arrival of the slug
   at the observer well provide significant value of the use of the
   magnetic-contrast agents in crosswell EM tomography.}},

Title = {{Preformed-Particle-Gel Extrusion Through Open Conduits During
   Conformance-Control Treatments}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Millimeter-sized (10 mu m-mm) preformed particle gels (PPGs) have been
   used successfully as conformance-control agents in more than 5,000
   wells. They help to control both water and CO2 production through
   high-permeability streaks or conduits (large pore openings), which
   naturally exist or are aggravated either by mineral solution or by a
   high injection pressure during the flooding process. This paper explores
   several factors that can have an important impact on the injectivity and
   plugging efficiency of PPGs in these conduits. Extensive experiments
   were conducted to examine the effect of the conduit inner diameter and
   the PPG strength on the ratio of the particle size to the opening
   diameter, injectivity index, resistance factor, and plugging efficiency.
   Five-foot tubes with four internal diameters were designed to emulate
   the opening conduits. Three pressure taps were mounted along the tubes
   to monitor PPG transport and plugging performance. The results show that
   weak gel has less injection pressure at a large particle/opening ratio
   compared to strong gel. PPG strength affected injectivity more
   significantly than did particle/opening ratio. Resistance factor
   increased as the brine concentration and conduit inner diameter
   increased. PPGs can significantly reduce the permeability of a conduit,
   and their plugging efficiency depends highly on the particle strength
   and the conduit inner diameter. The particle size of PPGs was reduced
   during their transport through conduits. Experimental results confirm
   that the size reduction was caused by both dehydration and breakdown. On
   the basis of the laboratory data, two correlations were developed to
   quantitatively calculate the resistance factor and the stable injection
   pressure as a function of the particle strength, particle/opening ratio,
   and shear rate. This research provides significant insight into
   designing better millimeter-sized particle-gel treatments intended for
   use in large openings, including open fractures, caves, worm holes, and
   conduits.}},

   Reservoirs}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1154-1166}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{There are few low-salinity-water-injection (LSWI) models proposed for
   carbonate rocks, mainly because of incomplete understanding of complex
   chemical interactions of rock/oil/brine. This paper describes a new
   empirical method to model the LSWI effect on oil recovery from carbonate
   rocks, on the basis of the history matching and validation of recently
   published corefloods. In this model, the changes in the oil relative
   permeability curve and residual oil saturation as a result of the LSWI
   effect are considered. The water relative permeability parameters are
   assumed constant, which is a relatively fair assumption on the basis of
   history matching of coreflood data. The capillary pressure is neglected
   because we assumed several capillary pressure curves in our simulations
   in which it had a negligible effect on the history-match results. The
   proposed model is implemented in the UTCHEM simulator, which is a 3D
   multiphase flow, transport, and chemical-flooding simulator developed at
   The University of Texas at Austin (UTCHEM 2000), to match and predict
   the multiple cycles of low-salinity experiments. The screening criteria
   for using the proposed LSWI model are addressed in the paper. The
   developed model gives more insight into the oil-production potential of
   future waterflood projects with a modified water composition for
   injection.}},

Abstract = {{Various complex self-assembled morphologies of lamellar- and
   cylinder-forming block copolymers comprising
   poly(dimethylsiloxane)-b-polylactide (PDMS-b-PLA) confined in
   cylindrical channels were generated. Combining top-down lithography with
   bottom-up block copolymer self-assembly grants access to morphologies
   that are otherwise inaccessible with the bulk materials. Channel
   diameter (D) was systematically varied with four diblock copolymers
   having different compositions and bulk domain spacing (L-0),
   corresponding to a range of frustration ratios (D/L-0 from 2 to 4).
   Excessive packing frustration imposed by the channels leads to contorted
   domains. The resulting morphologies depend strongly on both D/L-0 and
   copolymer composition. Under several circumstances, mixtures of complex
   morphologies were observed, which hypothetically arise from the severe
   sensitivity to D/L-0 combined with the inherent compositional/molar mass
   dispersities associated with the nonuniform synthetic materials and
   silicon templates. Stochastic calculations offer compelling support for
   the hypothesis, and tractable pathways toward solving this apparent
   conundrum are proposed. The materials hold great promise for
   next-generation nanofabrication to address several emerging
   technologies, offering significantly enhanced versatility to basic
   diblock copolymers as templates for fabricating complex nanoscale

Abstract = {{Passivity enforcement is an important issue for macromodeling for
   passive systems from measured or simulated data. Existing passivity
   enforcement techniques based on iteratively fixing the passivity either
   suffer from convergence issue or lack optimality that will sometimes
   lead to unacceptable error. In addition to the traditional two-stage
   (fitting plus enforcement) schemes, we propose a postenforcement
   optimization, which takes a passive yet not necessarily accurate model
   as the starting point, and performs local search to find the local
   optimum. A new technique, called domain-alternated optimization is
   proposed to eliminate passivity constraints while still guarantees
   strict passivity during the optimization. Experiments show that taking
   the models generated from existing enforcement methods, the proposed
   method can provide significant improvement on accuracy. The proposed
   method is efficient and can deal with problems up to a few tens of
   thousands of variables.}},

Abstract = {{With aggressive device scaling, timing failures have become more
   prevalent due to manufacturing defects and process variations. When
   timing failure occurs, it is important to take corrective actions
   immediately. Therefore, an efficient and fast diagnosis method is
   essential. In this paper, we propose a new diagnostic method using
   timing information. Our method approximately estimates all the segment
   delays of measured paths in a design, using inequality-constrained least
   squares methods. Then, the proposed method ranks the possible locations
   of delay defects based on the difference between estimated segment
   delays and the expected values of segment delays. The method works well
   for multiple delay defects as well as single delay defects. Experiment
   results show that our method yields good diagnostic resolution. With the
   proposed method, the average first hit rank (FHR), was within 7 for
   single delay defect and within 8 for multiple delay defects.}},

   research in the United States, inclusive efforts have engaged 266
   individuals from 149 cities in 30 countries during one multiday
   workshop, seven conference sessions, and several other virtual and
   in-person activities. The resulting taxonomy comprises 455 terms
   arranged in 14 branches and six levels. This taxonomy was found to
   satisfy four criteria for validity and reliability: (1) keywords
   assigned to a set of abstracts were reproducible by multiple
   researchers, (2) the taxonomy comprised terms that could be selected as
   keywords to fully describe 243 articles in three journals, (3) the
   keywords for those 243 articles were evenly distributed across the
   branches of the taxonomy, and (4) the authors of 31 conference papers
   agreed with 90\% of researcher-assigned keywords. This report also
   describes guidelines developed to help authors consistently assign
   keywords for their articles by encouraging them to choose terms from
   three categories: (1) context/focus/topic, (2)
   purpose/target/motivation, and (3) research approach.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale, aims and objectives The goal is to fully automate the
   calculation of a breast ptosis measure from clinical photographs through
   automatic localization of fiducial points relevant to the measure.
   Methods Sixty-eight women (97 clinical photographs) who underwent or
   were scheduled for breast reconstruction were included. The photographs
   were divided into a development set (N = 49) and an evaluation set (N =
   48). The breast ptosis measure is obtained automatically from distances
   between three fiducial points: the nipple, the lowest visible point of
   breast (LVP), and the lateral terminus of the inframammary fold (LT).
   The nipple is localized using the YIQ colour space to highlight the
   contrast between the areola and the surrounding breast skin. The areola
   is localized using its shape, location and high Q component intensity.
   The breast contour is estimated using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
   on the gradient of the photograph in greyscale. The lowest point of the
   estimated contour is set as the LVP. To locate the anatomically subtle
   LT, the location of patient's axilla is used as a reference.
   Results The algorithm's efficacy was evaluated by comparing manual and
   automated localizations of the fiducial points. The average nipple
   diameter was used as a cut-off to define success. The algorithm showed
   90, 91 and 83\% accuracy for locating the nipple, LVP and LT in the
   evaluation set, respectively.
   Conclusion This study presents a new automated algorithm that may
   facilitate the quantification of breast ptosis from lateral views of
   patients' photographs.}},

Abstract = {{Background Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the most common
   arrhythmia. Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are at
   increased risk of stroke; therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and
   safety of different approaches to prevent this major complication.
   Methods and Results We conducted electronic database searches of phase
   III randomized controlled trials. The groups were novel oral
   anticoagulants, Watchman left atrial appendage occlusion device
   (DEVICE), and warfarin. Efficacy outcomes were stroke or systemic
   embolism, and all-cause mortality. Safety outcome was major bleeding and
   procedure-related complications. A subgroup analysis of the elderly
   population was done. We used random-effects model to compare pooled
   outcomes and tested for heterogeneity. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for each outcome. Seven
   randomized controlled trials (n=73978) were included. There was a
   significant difference favoring novel oral anticoagulants for systemic
   embolism (OR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.97; P=0.01), all-cause mortality
   (OR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.84-0.94; P<0.001), and safety outcomes (OR, 0.79;
   95\% CI, 0.65-0.97; P=0.026) compared with warfarin. No difference was
   seen between DEVICE and warfarin for efficacy end points; however,
   DEVICE had more complications (OR, 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.14-3.01; P=0.012).
   In the elderly (6 randomized controlled trials, n=30699), systemic
   embolism was favored with novel oral anticoagulants over warfarin (OR,
   0.77; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.87; P0.001). No evidence of significant
   publication bias was found.
   Conclusions Novel oral anticoagulants is superior to warfarin for stroke
   prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This benefit was also
   observed in the elderly population. DEVICE is a reasonable noninferior
   alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention, but cautious use is
   essential given safety concerns.}},

Abstract = {{We study routing and scheduling algorithms for relay-assisted,
   multichannel downlink wireless networks {[}e.g., orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based cellular systems with
   relays]. Over such networks, while it is well understood that the
   BackPressure algorithm is stabilizing (i.e., queue lengths do not become
   arbitrarily large), its performance (e.g., delay, buffer usage) can be
   poor. In this paper, we study an alternative-the MaxWeight
   algorithm-variants of which are known to have good performance in a
   single-hop setting. In a general relay setting, however, MaxWeight is
   not even stabilizing (and thus can have very poor performance). In this
   paper, we study an iterative MaxWeight algorithm for routing and
   scheduling in downlink multichannel relay networks. We show that,
   surprisingly, the iterative MaxWeight algorithm can stabilize the system
   in several large-scale instantiations of this setting (e.g., general
   arrivals with full-duplex relays, bounded arrivals with half-duplex
   relays). Furthermore, using both many-channel large-deviations analysis
   and simulations, we show that iterative MaxWeight outperforms the
   BackPressure algorithm from a queue-length/delay perspective.}},

   basic questions include: How and where to replicate files? What is the
   impact of dynamic service allocation across request types, and whether
   such allocations can provide substantial gains over simpler load

   over-constrained. Semi-implicit time integration circumvents this
   difficulty in the fully-discrete scheme. If this time-stepping algorithm
   is applied to fluid-structure systems that approach steady solutions,
   though, we find that spatially-oscillating modes of the Lagrange
   multiplier field can grow over time. In the present work, we stabilize
   the semi-implicit integration scheme to prevent potential divergence of
   the multiplier field as time goes to infinity. This stabilized time
   integration may also be applied in pseudo-time within each time step,
   giving rise to a fully implicit solution method. We discuss the
   theoretical implications of this stabilization scheme for several
   simplified model problems, then demonstrate its practical efficacy
   through numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{Several proposed beyond-CMOS devices based on two-dimensional (2D)
   heterostructures require the deposition of thin dielectrics between 2D
   layers. However, the direct deposition of dielectrics on 2D materials is
   challenging due to their inert surface chemistry. To deposit
   high-quality, thin dielectrics on 2D materials, a flat lying titanyl
   phthalocyanine (TiOPc) monolayer, deposited via the molecular beam
   epitaxy, was employed to create a seed layer for atomic layer deposition
   (ALD) on 2D materials, and the initial stage of growth was probed using
   in situ STM. ALD pulses of trimethyl aluminum (TMA) and H2O resulted in
   the uniform deposition of AlOx on the TiOPc/HOPG. The uniformity of the
   dielectric is consistent with DFT calculations showing multiple reaction
   sites are available on the TiOPc molecule for reaction with TMA.
   Capacitors prepared with SO cycles of AlOx on TiOPc/graphene display a
   capacitance greater than 1000 nF/cm(2), and dual-gated devices have
   current densities of 10(-7)A/cm(2) with 40 cycles.}},

Title = {{Surface Coating Constraint Induced Self-Discharging of Silicon

Abstract = {{One of the key challenges of Si-based anodes for lithium ion batteries
   is the large volume change upon lithiation and delithiation, which
   commonly leads to electrochemi-mechanical degradation and subsequent
   fast capacity fading. Recent studies have shown that applying
   nanometer-thick coating layers on Si nanoparticle (SiNPs) enhances
   cyclability and capacity retention. However, it is far from clear how
   the coating layer function from the point of view of both surface
   chemistry and electrochemi-mechanical effect. Herein, we use in situ
   transmission electron microscopy to investigate the
   lithiation/delithiation kinetics of SiNPs coated with a conductive
   polymer, polypyrrole (PPy). We discovered that this coating layer can
   lead to ``self-delithiation{''} or ``self-discharging{''} at different
   stages of lithiation. We rationalized that the self-discharging is
   driven by the internal compressive stress generated inside the lithiated
   SiNPs due to the constraint effect of the coating layer. We also noticed
   that the critical size of lithiation-induced fracture of SiNPs is
   increased from similar to 150 nm for bare SiNPs to similar to 380 nm for
   the PPy-coated SiNPs, showing a mechanically protective role of the
   coating layer. These observations demonstrate both beneficial and
   detrimental roles of the surface coatings, shedding light on rational
   design of surface coatings for silicon to retain high-power and high
   capacity as anode for lithium ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Antibody aggregation is frequently mediated by the complementarity
   determining regions within the variable domains and can significantly
   decrease purification yields, shorten shelf-life and increase the risk
   of anti-drug immune responses. Aggregation-resistant antibodies could
   offset these risks; accordingly, we have developed a directed evolution
   strategy to improve Fab stability. A Fab-phage display vector was
   constructed and the V-H domain targeted for mutagenesis by error-prone
   PCR. To enrich for thermoresistant clones, the resulting phage library
   was transiently heated, followed by selection for binding to an
   anti-light chain constant domain antibody. Five unique variants were
   identified, each possessing one to three amino acid substitutions. Each
   engineered Fab possessed higher, Escherichia coli expression yield, a
   2-3A degrees C increase in apparent melting temperature and improved
   aggregation resistance upon heating at high concentration. Select
   mutations were combined and shown to confer additive improvements to
   these biophysical characteristics. Finally, the wild-type and most
   stable triple variant Fab variant were converted into a human IgG1 and
   expressed in mammalian cells. Both expression level and aggregation
   resistance were similarly improved in the engineered IgG1. Analysis of
   the wild-type Fab crystal structure provided a structural rationale for
   the selected residues changes. This approach can help guide future Fab
   stabilization efforts.}},

Title = {{CO2-sensitive foams for mobility control and channeling blocking in
   enhanced WAG process}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{234-243}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mobility control is a key issue in gas and CO2 flooding process, and
   water-alternating-gas (CO2) injection (WAG) has been used in various
   field applications. The WAG process can be CO2 foam assisted in order to
   further improve the sweeping efficiency of the injectants. In this
   study, a novel foaming method for reducing CO2 mobility and blocking gas
   channeling is proposed, which is based on a CO2-sensitive chemical
   (compound with amine group) to generate foams or thicken the injected
   water in situ. The CO2-sensitive chemical is referred to that, in a
   reaction triggered by CO2, it can be converted to an effective
   surfactant or foam agent. The chemical can be dissolved in water and
   injected as a slug. In this study, the foaming behavior and the
   CO2-sensitivity of the chemical were tested using a visualization
   apparatus and a viscometer in the presence of CO2 and N-2. The
   capability of the foams generated using the CO2-sisentive chemical for
   mobility control was evaluated via gas flooding experiments of
   sand-packs. Stable CO2 foams have been obtained at high temperature and
   pressure conditions (up to 140 degrees C and 16 MPa), and high viscosity
   was observed in the chemical solution when CO2 was present in comparison
   with that of N-2, indicating the chemical's sensitivity with dissolved
   CO2 in water. In the sand-pack flooding experiments, a high resistance
   factor was achieved in a simulated WAG process using the CO2-sensitive
   chemical, which is attributed to the CO2 foams and viscous micelles
   generated in situ during CO2 injection. (C) 2015 The Institution of

Abstract = {{The performance of anaerobic co-digestion of municipal wastewater sludge
   and un-dewatered grease trap waste was investigated for assessing direct
   feed of grease trap waste in municipal digesters. Substrate degradation,
   methane potential and process inhibition were monitored in two
   laboratory scale, semi-continuous feed reactors under mesophilic
   conditions (35 degrees C). The methane potential increased from 384 ml
   CH4 g(-1) VSadded to 536 and 641 ml CH4 g(-1) VSadded at 0\%, 25\% and
   46\% grease trap waste feed ratios, respectively. Co-digestion failed at
   the 70\% grease trap waste feed ratio. The results demonstrated that
   feeds with volatile acids to alkalinity ratios greater than 2 could
   cause process failure. Recovery of the digesters following upset
   conditions was achieved by feeding digester effluent from a full scale
   digester for 10 days. The performance and stability results observed in
   this study were compared with data from previous studies of co-digestion
   of dewatered grease trap waste. The grease trap waste feed ratio that
   yielded stable co-digestion was increased by using un-dewatered grease
   trap waste. The results demonstrated that using un-dewatered grease trap
   waste as the co-substrate instead of dewatered grease trap waste can
   improve digester performance and provide a more stable digestion. (C)

Abstract = {{Nickel-rich layered LiMO2 (M = transition metal) oxides doped with iron
   exhibit high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline
   electrolytes. The LiMO2 oxides offer the possibility of investigating
   the influence of the number of d electrons on OER by tuning the
   oxidation state of M via chemical or electrochemical delithiation.
   Accordingly, we investigate here the electrocatalytic behavior of
   LiNi0.7Co0.3O2 and LiNi0.7Co0.2Fe0.1O2 before and after chemical
   delithiation. In addition to varying the oxidation state of the
   transition-metal ions, we find that chemical delithiation also affects
   the local chemical environment and morphology. The electrochemical
   response differs depending on whether the delithiation occurred ex situ
   chemically or in situ during the electrocatalysis. The results point to
   the important role of in situ transformation in LiMO2 in alkaline
   electrolytes during electrocatalytic cycling.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate ultrathin metasurfaces defined by anisotropic
   conductivity tensors using a Green's function approach, focusing on
   their exciting plasmonic interactions and dramatic enhancement of
   light-matter interactions for hyperbolic dispersion. We apply our
   analytical formulation to explore several practical implementations at
   THz and near infrared frequencies, including electrically and
   magnetically-biased graphene sheets - a natural isotropic elliptic
   metasurface - and densely-packed arrays of graphene ribbons modelled
   through an effective medium approach. This latter configuration allows
   the electrical control of their band diagram topology - from elliptic to
   hyperbolic, going through the extremely anisotropic sigma -near-zero
   case - providing unprecedented control over the confinement and
   direction of plasmon propagation while simultaneously boosting the local
   density of states. Finally, we study the influence of the strip
   granularity to delimit the accuracy of effective medium theory to model
   the electromagnetic interactions with hyperbolic metasurfaces. Our
   findings may lead to the development of ultrathin reconfigurable
   plasmonic devices able to provide extreme confinement and dynamic
   guidance of light while strongly interacting with their surroundings,
   with direct application in sensing, imaging, hyperlensing, on-chip

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to examine the dynamic interaction of a
   cough jet with different indoor airflow distributions created by linear
   slot diffusers considering the inter-personal transport of coughed
   particles. The experimental measurements were performed in a chamber,
   where the interaction of a cough jet and downward jets with various
   momentums was visualized by smoke. In this study, parameters related to
   the dynamic interaction of a transient cough jet and a steady downward
   jet have been studied: (1) distance between the cough jet source and an
   exposed dummy (ED); (2) the initial momentum of the downward plane jet.
   The experimental results indicate that the ceiling-attached horizontal
   jets that are widely applied in the over-head mixing ventilation systems
   have difficulties in deflecting the cough jet, and thereby have
   difficulties in reducing inter-personal transport of the coughed
   particles. This study found that a downward plane jet could prevent the
   transport of cough particles from the cough dummy to the ED. When the ED
   is standing 0.5 meter away from the cough dummy, the personal exposure
   (PE) level to coughed particles by using a downward plane jet could be
   two orders of magnitude lower than by using ceiling-attached horizontal
   jets. In addition, this study quantifies the interaction of a cough jet
   and a downward plane jet in their ability to reduce exposure to coughed
   particles. The results may be used in the process of diffuser selection
   and suggests that ventilation systems employing downward plane jets with
   high discharge velocities might be useful in public spaces to reduce
   inter-personal exposure to coughed particles.}},

Title = {{Optimizing plasmonic nanoantennas via coordinated multiple coupling}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Plasmonic nanoantennas, which can efficiently convert light from free
   space into sub-wavelength scale with the local field enhancement, are
   fundamental building blocks for nanophotonic systems. Predominant design
   methods, which exploit a single type of near-or far-field coupling in
   pairs or arrays of plasmonic nanostructures, have limited the tunability
   of spectral response and the local field enhancement. To overcome this
   limit, we are developing a general strategy towards exploiting the
   coordinated effects of multiple coupling. Using Au bowtie nanoantenna
   arrays with metal-insulator-metal configuration as examples, we
   numerically demonstrate that coordinated design and implementation of
   various optical coupling effects leads to both the increased tunability
   in the spectral response and the significantly enhanced electromagnetic
   field. Furthermore, we design and analyze a refractive index sensor with
   an ultra-high figure-of-merit (254), a high signal-to-noise ratio and a
   wide working range of refractive indices, and a narrow-band
   near-infrared plasmonic absorber with 100\% absorption efficiency, high
   quality factor of up to 114 and a wide range of tunable wavelength from
   800 nm to 1,500 nm. The plasmonic nanoantennas that exploit coordinated
   multiple coupling will benefit a broad range of applications, including
   label-free bio-chemical detection, reflective filter, optical trapping,
   hot-electron generation, and heat-assisted magnetic recording.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we synthesized radially developed metal oxides (MOs) array

   carbon cloth (CC) and put forward an effective strategy to greatly
   improve the supercapacitor performance by enhancing the structural
   integrity and electrical oneness of the MO-based electrode. The hybrid
   NiMoO4/polyaniline (PANI) electrode exhibits a high areal specific
   capacitance of ca. 1.34 F cm(-2) (1340 F g(-1)) at a current density of
   1 mA cm(-2). In comparison, the pristine NiMoO4 nanowires (NWs) have a
   specific capacitance of ca. 1.142 F cm(-2) (1142 F g(-1)) at the same
   current density. An outstanding capacitance retention for NiMoO4/PANI
   hybrid nanowire electrodes has been achieved (ca. 96.7\% after 2000
   cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of over 99.5\%), which is
   superior to pure NiMoO4 (ca. 81\% after 2000 cycles). Moreover, a
   flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) employing
   NiMoO4/PANI and commercial active carbon (AC) as the positive and
   negative electrodes, respectively, delivers a maximum specific energy of
   99.26 Wh Kg(-1) (297.78 mWh cm(-2)) and a maximum specific power of
   10667 W Kg(-1) (32.04 mW cm(-2)). In addition, the ASC device
   demonstrates highly stable cyclic performance with outstanding and

Abstract = {{The structured nature of video data motivates introducing video-aware
   decisions that make use of this structure for improved video
   transmission over wireless networks. In this paper, we introduce an
   architecture for real-time video transmission over multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems using loss
   visibility side information. We quantify the perceptual importance of a
   packet through the packet loss visibility and use the loss visibility
   distribution to provide a notion of relative packet importance. To
   jointly achieve high video quality and low latency, we define the
   optimization objective function as the throughput weighted by the loss
   visibility of each packet, a proxy for the total perceptual value of
   successful packets per unit of time. We solve the problem of mapping
   video packets to MIMO subchannels and adapting per-stream rates to
   maximize the proposed objective. We show that the solution enables
   jointly reaping gains in terms of improved video quality and lower
   latency. Optimized packet-stream mapping enables transmission of more
   relevant packets over more reliable streams while unequal modulation
   opportunistically increases the transmission rate on the stronger
   streams to enable low latency delivery of high priority packets. Tested
   on H. 264-encoded video sequences, for a 4 x 4 MIMO system with three
   spatial streams, the proposed architecture achieves 8 dB power reduction
   for the same video quality and supports 2.4x higher throughput due to
   unequal modulation. Furthermore, the gains are achieved at the expense
   of few bits of cross-layer overhead rather than a complex cross-layer
   design.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed finite-element (FE) modeling procedure is presented for
   evaluating the redundancy of twin steel box-girder bridges. For this
   study, it was assumed that the passage of a truck live load triggers the
   sudden fracture of one girder. Because of the possibility of localized
   damage in some bridge components, the proposed computational models
   incorporate material nonlinearity to represent cracking and crushing of
   concrete and steel yielding. In addition, the proposed FE models are
   capable of capturing deck haunch separation by adopting a stud
   connection failure model. This failure mode was first observed during
   testing of a full-scale bridge that included a girder with a full-depth
   fracture. Analysis results show that typical twin steel box-girder
   bridges likely have greater redundancy than the current provisions
   indicate and that stud connection failure could significantly affect the
   redundancy of steel box-girder bridges. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{To improve the flame retardancy and mechanical properties of epoxy (EP),
   a novel intercalated layered double hydroxides (ILDHs) were synthesized
   by a solution intercalation method using ammonium alcohol polyvinyl
   phosphate as intercalator. The ILDHs were examined by X-ray diffraction,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive
   spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The conditions for
   synthesis of ILDHs have been optimized. Thermogravimetric analysis
   indicated a good char-forming property of ILDHs. The flame retardancy of
   epoxy was improved by adding ILDHs. The EP composites containing 30-40
   mass\% ILDHs passed UL-94V-0 rating. Tensile strength was also enhanced
   by adding 30-40 mass\% ILDHs, which was attributed to the involvement of
   physical cross-linking network among layered particles and polymer
   chains. The morphology and structures of residues generated during LOI
   test were investigated by SEM and FTIR to support a fundamental analysis
   for the mechanism of char formation. SEM observations of residues of the
   ILDHs/EP confirmed the formation of an incompact charred layer during
   combustion, which could inhibit the transmission of heat and mass during
   combustion. It may be inferred that ILDHs acted as a catalyst for
   esterification, dehydration and compact char formation of EP system.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction in surface and interface reflectance via the integration of
   subwavelength nanostructures in flexible polymer packaging material
   combined with incorporation of dielectric nanoislands into a
   conventional two-layer antireflection coating has been demonstrated,
   analyzed and optimized. Transmittance measurements of moth-eye textured
   polymer packaging sheets with different tapered pillar heights
   fabricated by reactive-ion etching and nanosphere lithography provide
   insights into the choice of the optimum nanostructure dimensions.
   Detailed computational modeling and simulations elucidate the physical
   nature of the antireflection performance of dielectric nanoisland
   structures integrated with a commercial two-layer antireflection
   coating, and provide guidance for design of the nanoisland structure for
   optimum antireflection performance. Measurements show that the
   integration of appropriately designed nanostructures in both polymer
   packaging material and conventional antireflection layers enables
   substantial increases in external quantum efficiency (E.Q.E.) and
   short-circuit current density (J(sc)) over a broad range of incident
   angles, compared to structures with conventional bilayer antireflection
   coatings and unpatterned polymer packaging sheets. A 1.1x increase in
   J(sc), derived directly from E.Q.E. measurements, at normal incidence,
   increasing to 1.67x improvement at 80 degrees angle of incidence,
   suggests that such an approach is promising for a variety of
   photovoltaic applications, particularly those where solar tracking is
   not feasible or practical. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the use of coal fly ash nanoparticles as a stabilizer to
   generate stable CO2 foams was explored. Considering the heterogeneous
   nature of fly ash, the samples were pretreated or separated into several
   different types of varying carbon content. The carbonaceous material
   present in the fly ash samples played an important role in generating
   stable oil/water (O/W) emulsions. As the carbon content in the fly ash
   sample increased, more emulsion was generated; also, the droplet size
   decreased and uniformity improved. A similar trend was observed in the
   CO2 emulsion tests. The fly ash samples containing carbonaceous material
   produced more emulsion phases with denser structures. It was difficult
   to generate stable CO2 foams without additives. However, fly ash
   nanoparticles combined with additives such as surfactants or collectors,
   specifically dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide and turpentine oil,
   produced stable and dense CO2 foams. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional thermal profiles were experimentally measured downstream
   of a single row of film cooling holes on both an adiabatic and a matched
   Biot number model turbine vane. The measurements were taken as a
   comparison to computational simulations of the same model and flow
   conditions. Previously, adiabatic and overall effectiveness comparisons
   have been made between experimental and computational data. To improve
   computational models of the evolution of a film cooling jet as it
   propagates downstream, the thermal field above the vane, not just the
   footprint on the vane surface, must be analyzed. This study expands
   these data to include 2D thermal fields above the vane at 0, 5, and 10
   hole diameters downstream of the film cooling holes. Four blowing ratios
   were tested, M = 0.28, 0.65, 1.11, and 2.41. In each case, the
   computational jets remained colder than the experimental jets because
   they did not diffuse into the mainstream as quickly. In addition, the
   computational results for the higher two blowing ratios exhibited the
   effects of the kidney vortex commonly studied in film cooling, but the
   experimental thermal fields were not dominated by this vortex. Finally,
   in comparing results above adiabatic and matched Biot number models,
   these thermal fields allow for an accurate analysis of whether or not
   the adiabatic wall temperature was a reasonable estimate of the driving
   temperature for heat transfer.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the coupling effects of objective-reduction and
   preference-ordering schemes on the search efficiency in the evolutionary
   process of multi-objective optimization. The difficulty in solving a
   many-objective problem increases with the number of conflicting
   objectives. Degenerated objective space can enhance the
   multi-directional search toward the multi-dimensional Pareto-optimal
   front by eliminating redundant objectives, but it is difficult to
   capture the true Pareto-relation among objectives in the non-optimal
   solution domain. Successive linear objective-reduction for the
   dimensionality-reduction and dynamic goal programming for
   preference-ordering are developed individually and combined with a
   multi-objective genetic algorithm in order to reflect the aspiration
   levels for the essential objectives adaptively during optimization. The
   performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated in redundant and
   non-redundant benchmark test problems. The preference-ordering approach
   induces the non-dominated solutions near the front despite enduring a
   small loss in diversity of the solutions. The induced solutions
   facilitate a degeneration of the Pareto-optimal front using successive
   linear objective-reduction, which updates the set of essential
   objectives by excluding non-conflicting objectives from the set of total
   objectives based on a principal component analysis. Salient issues
   related to real-world problems are discussed based on the results of an
   oil-field application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Our bodies depend on an exquisitely sensitive and refined temperature
   control system to maintain a state of health and homeostasis. The
   exceptionally broad range of physical activities that humans engage in
   and the diverse array of environmental conditions we face require
   remarkable strategies and mechanisms for regulating internal and
   external heat transfer processes. On the occasions for which the body
   suffers trauma, therapeutic temperature modulation is often the approach
   of choice for reversing injury and inflammation and launching a cascade
   of healing. The focus of human thermoregulation is maintenance of the
   body core temperature within a tight range of values, even as internal
   rates of energy generation may vary over an order of magnitude,
   environmental convection, and radiation heat loads may undergo large
   changes in the absence of any significant personal control, surface
   insulation may be added or removed, all occurring while the body's
   internal thermostat follows a diurnal circadian cycle that may be
   altered by illness and anesthetic agents. An advanced level of
   understanding of the complex physiological function and control of the
   human body may be combined with skill in heat transfer analysis and
   design to develop life-saving and injury-healing medical devices. This
   paper will describe some of the challenges and conquests the author has
   experienced related to the practice of heat transfer for maintenance of
   health and enhancement of healing processes.}},

Title = {{A eutectic mixture of galactitol and mannitol as a phase change material
   for latent heat storage}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{139-146}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The thermophysical properties of mixtures of galactitol and mannitol
   were examined via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray
   powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. The aforementioned sugars were found
   to form a eutectic mixture at a 30:70 molar ratio of galactitol and
   manntitol, and displayed a melting point of 153 degrees C while
   maintaining a high latent heat of fusion (Delta H-fus = 292 J g(-1)).
   The XRD data revealed that the eutectic mixture contained the alpha,
   beta, and delta forms of mannitol with the delta form being the major
   component. By varying the temperature ramp rates utilized in the DSC
   measurements from 0.5 degrees C min(-1) to 20 degrees C min(-1), the
   heat of crystallization as well as the crystallization temperature
   increased (c.f., Delta H-crys: 64 J g(-1) -> 197 J g(-1); T-c: 68
   degrees C -> 105 degrees C). In addition, the temperature and the
   enthalpy of crystallization were also improved by up to 34\% through the
   addition of small quantities (up to 0.5 wt\%) of nucleating agents, such
   as graphite powder or silver iodide. After 100 heating/cooling cycles
   under an atmosphere of nitrogen, the heat of fusion of the eutectic
   mixture decreased by only 4\% with no change in the melting point, and
   the mixture appeared to be chemically stable according to a Fourier
   transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analysis. Collectively, these
   data indicate that the eutectic mixture exhibits excellent cyclic
   stability under ambient atmospheres and offers potential for use in
   thermal energy storage applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Oxides of nitrogen (NO (x) ) are ubiquitous pollutants in large urban
   areas of the world. Photocatalytic materials have been studied,
   primarily in the laboratory, for their ability to remove oxides of
   nitrogen. The study described herein compared NO (x) removal efficacies
   of three commercially-available photocatalytic coatings (a stucco, a
   white paint and a clear paint) applied to roadside concrete. The study
   aimed to elucidate how environmental parameters and exposure to real
   roadside conditions impact NO (x) removal. This was achieved through
   periodic laboratory chamber testing and material characterization of
   concrete slabs stored by busy roadways for a 20-month period. It was
   observed that roadside exposure led to physical degradation of the clear
   paint coating, while the other two remained intact. The stucco coating
   was the most effective at NO (x) removal, but the efficacy nonetheless
   diminished over time.}},

Abstract = {{Over 300,000 heart valve replacements are performed annually to replace
   stenotic and regurgitant heart valves. Bioprosthetic heart valves
   (BHVs), derived from glutaraldehyde crosslinked (GLUT) porcine aortic
   valve leaflets or bovine pericardium are often used. However, valve
   failure can occur within 12-15 years due to calcification and/or
   progressive degeneration. In this study, we have developed a novel
   fabrication method that utilizes carbodiimide, neomycin trisulfate, and
   pentagalloyl glucose crosslinking chemistry (TRI) to better stabilize
   the extracellular matrix of porcine aortic valve leaflets. We
   demonstrate that TRI treated leaflets show similar biomechanics to GLUT
   crosslinked leaflets. TRI treated leaflets had better resistance to
   enzymatic degradation in vitro and demonstrated better tearing toughness
   after challenged with enzymatic degradation. When implanted
   subcutaneously in rats for up to 90 days, GLUT control leaflets
   calcified heavily while TRI treated leaflets resisted calcification,
   retained more ECM components, and showed better biocompatibility. (C)

   contrast in three dimensions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{298}},
Pages = {{766-786}},

Abstract = {{We propose numerical algorithms for the simulation of the dynamics of
   three-dimensional vesicles suspended in viscous Stokesian fluid. Our
   method is an extension of our previous work (S.K. Veerapaneni et al.,
   2011) {[}37] to flows with viscosity contrast. This generalization
   requires a change in the boundary integral formulation of the solution,
   in which a double-layer Stokes integral is introduced, and leads to
   changes in the fluid dynamics due to the viscosity contrast of the
   vesicles, which can no longer be efficiently resolved with existing
   algorithms.
   In this paper we describe the algorithms needed to handle flows with
   viscosity contrast accurately and efficiently. We show that a globally
   semi-implicit method does not have any time-step stability constraint
   for flows with single and multiple vesicles with moderate viscosity
   contrast and the computational cost per simulation unit time is
   comparable to or less than that of an explicit scheme. Automatic
   oversampling adaptation enables us to achieve high accuracy with very
   low spectral resolution. We conduct numerical experiments to investigate
   the stability, accuracy, and the computational cost of the algorithms.
   Overall, our method achieves several orders of magnitude speed-up
   compared to the standard explicit schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Seismic landslide hazard maps are used in regional planning to identify
   zones that require detailed, site-specific studies. Most seismic
   landslide hazard maps are based on predicted sliding block displacements
   for a given level of shaking, but this deterministic approach does not
   fully consider the aleatory variability in the sliding displacement
   prediction or the epistemic uncertainty in the soil and slope
   properties. Probabilistic approaches incorporate aleatory variability
   through a sliding displacement hazard curve and they incorporate
   epistemic uncertainties (e.g., soil shear strength, empirical
   displacement model) through a logic-tree approach. This fully
   probabilistic approach can be implemented efficiently on a regional
   scale for seismic landslide hazard maps using ground motion hazard data
   and the Mean Xi) Threshold approach. This paper applies the
   probabilistic approach to develop a seismic landslide hazard map for
   Anchorage, Alaska. The results show that incorporating epistemic
   uncertainty can increase the area of high seismic landslide hazard by a
   factor of 2 to 3 as compared to analyses without any epistemic
   uncertainty. Additionally, incorporating a logic-tree avoids using
   overly conservative input parameters in a deterministic approach to
   capture these uncertainties, which can lead to an unrealistic inflation
   of the seismic landslide hazard. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Adhesion between soft matter is a universal mechanical problem in
   bio-engineering and bio-integration. The Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR)
   method is widely used to measure the work of adhesion and work of
   separation between soft materials. In this study, the JKR theory is
   recaptured and three complementary dimensionless parameters are
   summarized to help design adhesion measurement experiments compatible
   with the JKR theory. The work of adhesion/separation between two
   commonly used soft elastomers, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard (R)
   184) and Ecoflex (R) 0300, is measured by the JKR method using a
   dynamical mechanical analyzer. Effects of base polymer to curing agent
   mixing ratio and solvent extraction are examined. A unified adhesion
   mechanism is proposed to explain the different adhesion behaviors. It is
   concluded that chain-matrix interaction is the most effective adhesion
   mechanism compared with chain-chain or matrix-matrix interactions.
   Chain-chain interaction obstructs chain-matrix interaction as it either
   blocks or entangles with surface chains which could have interacted with
   the matrix.}},

   (m-HAB) or 3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (p-HAB) with

   prepared via an ester-acid monomer. The polyhydroxyimides were then
   acetylated using acetic anhydride to change the ortho-functional groups
   on the polymer chains. These ortho-functional polyimides were used as
   precursors for thermal rearrangement (TR) to polybenzoxazoles for gas
   separation membranes. The permeability coefficients of TR polymers
   significantly improved as the ortho-functional polyimides converted to
   polybenzoxazoles. The influence of meta and para isomeric monomers on
   the gas transport properties of the resulting TR polybenzoxazoles were
   studied. In addition, gas permeation properties show a dependency on the
   size of the ortho-functionality of the polyimide precursors. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{CO2 injection in oil reservoirs offers the dual advantage of increasing
   oil recovery as well as storage to combat global warming. The injected
   CO2, however, may react with ions present in the brine as well as the
   rock. In this research, we present a model that quantifies the impact of
   these geochemical reactions on the phase behavior of hydrocarbon
   mixtures. A Gibbs free energy model is proposed that unifies different
   phase descriptions - the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (PR EOS)
   description for hydrocarbon phase components, the Pitzer activity
   coefficient model for aqueous components and an ideal solid phase. In
   particular, we illustrate the use of this model to determine the impact
   of geochemical reactions, introduced by the presence of an aqueous phase
   with ions and a solid calcite phase, on the phase envelope of
   CO2-nC(14)H(30) mixture with different phase descriptions. The presented
   Gibbs free energy model is adaptable to different reservoir brines and
   can be used to assess the maximum impact of geochemical reactions during
   CO2 injection in different hydrocarbon reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out
   to observe directly in real time the lithiation and delithiation of
   silicon (Si) nanowires with significant amounts of tin (Sn). The
   incorporation of Sn significantly enhances the lithiation rate compared
   to typical Si nanowires: surface diffusion is enhanced by 2 orders of
   magnitude and the bulk lithiation rate by 1 order of magnitude,
   resulting in a sequential surface-then-core lithiation mechanism. Pore
   formation was observed in the nanowires during delithiation as a result
   of the fast lithiation/delithiation kinetics of the nanowires. Pore
   formation was found to be associated with nonlithiated crystalline
   domains in the nanowire, which prevent uniform structural changes of the
   nanowire, and the resulting pores increase in size after each cycle.
   When an amorphous Si shell was applied to the nano-wires, pore formation
   was not observed during the in situ TEM experiments. Ex situ TEM
   analysis of Sn-containing Si nanowires cycled in coin cell batteries
   also showed that the application of an amorphous Si shell slows pore
   formation in these nanowires, while fast lithiation/delithiation
   kinetics is retained.}},

Abstract = {{As a primary component in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the separator
   may require a custom design in order to facilitate electrochemical
   stability and reversibility. Here, a custom separator with an activated
   carbon nanofiber (ACNF)-filter coated onto a polypropylene membrane is
   presented. The entire configuration is comprised of the ACNF filter
   arranged adjacent to the sulfur cathode so that it can filter out the
   freely migrating polysulfides and suppress the severe polysulfide
   diffusion. Four differently optimized ACNF-filter-coated separators have
   been developed with tunable micropores as an investigation into the
   electrochemical and engineering design parameters of functionalized
   separators. The optimized parameters that are verified by
   electrochemical and microstructural analyses require the coated ACNF
   filter to possess the following: (i) a porous architecture with abundant
   micropores, (ii) small micropore sizes, and (iii) high electrical
   conductivity and effective electrolyte immersion. It is found that the
   ACNF20-filter-coated separator demonstrates an overall superior boost in
   the electrochemical utilization (discharge capacity: 1270 mA h g(-1))
   and polysulfide retention (capacity fade rate: 0.13\% cycle(-1) after
   200 cycles). These results show that the modified thin-film-coating
   technique is a viable approach to designing ultratough
   ACNF-filter-coated separators with outstanding mechanical strength and
   flexibility as an advanced component in Li-S cells.}},

Abstract = {{Single-molecule studies of protein DNA interactions have shed critical
   insights into the molecular mechanisms of nearly every aspect of DNA
   metabolism. The development of DNA curtains a method for organizing
   arrays of DNA molecules on a fluid lipid bilayer has greatly facilitated
   these studies by increasing the number of reactions that can be observed
   in a single experiment. However, the utility of DNA curtains is limited
   by the challenges associated with depositing nanometer-scale lipid
   diffusion barriers onto quartz microscope slides. Here, we describe a UV
   lithography-based method for large-scale fabrication of chromium (Cr)
   features and organization of DNA molecules at these features for
   high-throughput single-molecule studies. We demonstrate this approach by
   assembling 792 independent DNA arrays (containing >900 000 DNA
   molecules) within a single microfluidic flowcell. As a first proof of
   principle, we track the diffusion of Mlh1-Mlh3-a heterodimeric complex
   that participates in DNA mismatch repair and meiotic recombination. To
   further highlight the utility of this approach, we demonstrate a
   two-lane flowcell that facilitates concurrent experiments on different
   DNA substrates. Our technique greatly reduces the challenges associated
   with assembling DNA curtains and paves the way for the rapid acquisition
   of large statistical data sets from individual single-molecule
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Metasurfaces characterized by a transverse gradient of local impedance
   have recently opened exciting directions for light manipulation at the
   subwavelength scale. Here we add a temporal gradient to the picture,
   showing that spatiotemporal variations over a surface may greatly extend
   the degree of wave manipulation in metasurfaces, and break several of
   their constraints associated with symmetries. As an example, we
   synthesize a nonreciprocal classical analog to electromagnetically
   induced transparency, opening a narrow window of one-way efficient
   transmission in an otherwise opaque surface. These properties pave the
   way to magnetic-free, planarized, nonreciprocal ultrathin surfaces for
   free-space isolation.}},

Abstract = {{We report the formation of a quasi-two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG)
   at the interface of gamma-Al2O3/TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 (STO) grown by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD). The ALD growth of Al2O3 on STO(001)
   single crystal substrates was performed at temperatures in the range of
   200-345 degrees C. Trimethylaluminum and water were used as
   co-reactants. In situ reflection high energy electron diffraction, ex
   situ x-ray diffraction, and ex situ cross-sectional transmission
   electron microscopy were used to determine the crystallinity of the
   Al2O3 films. As-deposited Al2O3 films grown above 300 degrees C were
   crystalline with the gamma-Al2O3 phase. In situ x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy was used to characterize the Al2O3/STO interface,
   indicating that a Ti3+ feature in the Ti 2p spectrum of STO was formed
   after 2-3 ALD cycles of Al2O3 at 345 degrees C and even after the
   exposure to trimethylaluminum alone at 300 and 345 degrees C. The
   interface quasi-2-DEG is metallic and exhibits mobility values of
   similar to 4 and 3000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at room temperature and 15 K,
   respectively. The interfacial conductivity depended on the thickness of
   the Al2O3 layer. The Ti3+ signal originated from the near-interfacial
   region and vanished after annealing in an oxygen environment. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nonlinear metasurfaces based on coupling a locally enhanced plasmonic
   response to intersubband transitions of n-doped multi-quantum-wells
   (MQWs) can provide second-order susceptibilities orders of magnitude
   larger than any other nonlinear flat structure measured so far. Here we
   present a comprehensive theory to characterize the electromagnetic
   response of nonlinear processes occurring in ultrathin MQW-based
   plasmonic metasurfaces, providing a homogeneous model that takes phase
   matching at the unit-cell level and the influence of saturation and
   losses into account. In addition, the limits imposed by saturation of
   the MQW transitions on the nonlinear response of these metasurfaces are
   analytically derived, revealing useful guidelines to design devices with
   enhanced performance. Our approach is first validated using experimental
   data and then applied to theoretically investigate novel designs able to
   achieve significant second-harmonic generation efficiency in the
   infrared frequency band.}},

Abstract = {{The recent introduction of transient, bioresorbable electronics into the
   field of electronic device design offers promise for the areas of
   medical implants and environmental monitors, where programmed loss of
   function and environmental resorption are advantageous characteristics.
   Materials challenges remain, however, in protecting the labile device
   components from degradation at faster than desirable rates. Here we
   introduce an indirect passivation strategy for transient electronic
   devices that consists of encapsulation in multiple air pockets
   fabricated from silk fibroin. This approach is investigated through the
   properties of silk as a diffusional barrier to water penetration,
   coupled with the degradation of magnesium-based devices in humid air.
   Finally, silk pockets are demonstrated to be useful for controlled
   modulation of device lifetime. This approach may provide additional
   future opportunities for silk utility due to the low immunogenicity of
   the material and its ability to stabilize labile biotherapeutic dopants.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmofluidics is the synergistic integration of plasmonics and
   micro/nanofluidics in devices and applications in order to enhance
   performance. There has been significant progress in the emerging field
   of plasmofluidics in recent years. By utilizing the capability of
   plasmonics to manipulate light at the nanoscale, combined with the
   unique optical properties of fluids and precise manipulation via
   micro/nanofluidics, plasmofluidic technologies enable innovations in
   lab-on-a-chip systems, reconfigurable photonic devices, optical sensing,
   imaging, and spectroscopy. In this review article, the most recent
   advances in plasmofluidics are examined and categorized into
   plasmon-enhanced functionalities in microfluidics and
   microfluidics-enhanced plasmonic devices. The former focuses on
   plasmonic manipulations of fluids, bubbles, particles, biological cells,
   and molecules at the micro/nanoscale. The latter includes technological
   advances that apply microfluidic principles to enable reconfigurable
   plasmonic devices and performance-enhanced plasmonic sensors. The
