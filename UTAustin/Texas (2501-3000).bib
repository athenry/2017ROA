Abstract = {{Task graphs or dependence graphs are used in runtime systems to schedule
   tasks for parallel execution. In problem domains such as dense linear
   algebra and signal processing, dependence graphs can be generated from a
   program by static analysis. However, in emerging problem domains such as
   graph analytics, the set of tasks and dependences between tasks in a
   program are complex functions of runtime values and cannot be determined
   statically. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for exploiting
   parallelism in such programs. This approach is based on a data structure
   called the kinetic dependence graph (KDG), which consists of a
   dependence graph together with update rules that incrementally update
   the graph to reflect changes in the dependence structure whenever a task
   is completed.
   We have implemented a simple programming model that allows programmers
   to write these applications at a high level of abstraction, and a
   runtime within the Galois system {[}15] that builds the KDG
   automatically and executes the program in parallel. On a suite of
   programs that are difficult to parallelize otherwise, we have obtained
   speedups of up to 33 on 40 cores, out-performing third-party
   implementations in many cases.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of optical force as a consequence of momentum transfer
   is inevitably subject to the use of the proper momentum density and
   stress tensor. It is imperative and valuable to consider the intrinsic
   scheme of photon momentum transfer, particularly when a particle is
   embedded in a complex dielectric environment. Typically, we consider a
   particle submerged in an inhomogeneous background composed of different
   dielectric materials, excluding coherent illumination or hydrodynamic
   effects. A ray-tracing method is adopted to capture the direct process
   of momentum transfer from the complex background medium, and this
   approach is validated using the modified Einstein-Laub method, which
   uses only the interior fields of the particle in the calculation. In
   this way, debates regarding the calculation of the force with different
   stress tensors using exterior fields can be avoided. Our suggested
   interpretation supports only the Minkowski approach for the optical
   momentum transfer to the embedded scatterer while rejecting Peierls's
   and Abraham's approaches, though the momentum of a stably moving photon
   in a continuous background medium should be considered to be of the
   Abraham type. Our interpretation also provides a novel method of
   realizing a tractor beam for the exertion of negative force that offers
   an alternative to the use of negative-index materials, optical gain, or
   highly non-paraxial or multiple-light interference.}},

Abstract = {{Receding horizon trajectory optimization for optimal information
   gathering in opportunistic navigation environments is considered. A
   receiver is assumed to be dropped in an environment consisting of
   multiple signals of opportunity (SOPs) transmitters. The receiver has
   minimal a priori knowledge about its own states and the SOPs' states.
   The receiver draws pseudorange observations from the SOPs. The
   receiver's objective is to build a high-fidelity signal landscape map
   while simultaneously localizing itself within this map in space and
   time. Assuming that the receiver can control its maneuvers, the
   following two problems are considered. First, the minimal conditions
   under which the environment is completely observable are established. It
   is shown that receiver-controlled maneuvers reduce the minimal a priori
   information about the environment required for complete observability.
   Second, the trajectories that the receiver should traverse are
   prescribed. To this end, a one-step look-ahead (greedy) strategy is
   compared with a multistep look-ahead (receding horizon) strategy. The
   limitations and achieved improvements in the map quality and space-time
   localization accuracy due to the receding horizon strategy are
   quantified. The computational burden associated with the receding
   horizon strategy is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Deltaic systems are composed of distributary channels and
   interdistributary islands. While previous work has focused either on the
   channels or on the islands, here we study the hydrological exchange
   between channels and islands and point at its important role in delta
   morphology and ecology. We focus our analysis on Wax Lake Delta in
   coastal Louisiana (USA) and characterize the surface water component of
   hydrological connectivity through measurements of water discharge and
   hydraulic tracer propagation. We find that deltaic islands are zones of
   significant water flux as 23-54\% of the incoming distributary channel
   flux enters the islands. A calculation of the travel times through a
   channel-island complex shows travel times through the islands to be at
   least 3 times their channel counterparts. A dye release experiment also
   indicates that travel times in islands are much longer that those within
   channels as dye remained in the island for the 3.8 day duration of the
   experiment. Additionally, islands are more sensitive than channels to
   environmental forces such as tides, which cause flow reversal and thus
   can increase travel times through the islands. Our work defines the
   hydrological network of a river delta to include not only the
   distributary channel network but also the interdistributary islands,
   quantifies the implications of channel-island hydrological connectivity
   to travel times through the system, and discusses the relevance of our
   findings to channel mouth dynamics at the delta front and the potential
   for denitrification in coastal systems.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is one of the most prevalent vascular
   diseases in the U.S. afflicting an estimated 8 million people.
   Obstruction of peripheral arteries leads to insufficient nutrients and
   oxygen supply to extremities, which, if not treated properly, can
   potentially give rise to a severe condition called critical limb
   ischemia (CLI). CLI is associated with extremely high morbidities and
   mortalities. Conventional treatments such as angioplasty, atherectomy,
   stent implantation and bypass surgery have achieved some success in
   treating localized macrovascular disease but are limited by their
   invasiveness. An emerging alternative is the use of growth factor
   (delivered as genes or proteins) and cell therapy for PVD treatment. By
   delivering growth factors or cells to the ischemic tissue, one can
   stimulate the regeneration of functional vasculature network locally,
   re-perfuse the ischemic tissue, and thus salvage the limb. Here we
   review recent advance in nanomaterials, and discuss how their
   application can improve and facilitate growth factor or cell therapies.
   Specifically, nanoparticles (NPs) can serve as drug carrier and target
   to ischemic tissues and achieve localized and sustained release of
   pro-angiogenic proteins. As nonviral vectors, NPs can greatly enhance
   the transfection of target cells with pro-angiogenic genes with
   relatively fewer safety concern. Further, NPs may also be used in
   combination with cell therapy to enhance cell retention, cell survival
   and secretion of angiogenic factors. Lastly, nano/micro fibrous vascular
   grafts can be engineered to better mimic the structure and composition
   of native vessels, and hopefully overcome many complications/limitations
   associated with conventional synthetic grafts.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for quantifying the accuracy of extended X-ray
   absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting models. As a test system, we
   consider the structure of bare Au-147 nanoparticles as well as particles
   bound with thiol ligands, which are used to systematically vary disorder
   in the atomic structure of the nanoparticles. The accuracy of the
   fitting model is determined by comparing two distributions of bond
   lengths: (1) a direct average over a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory
   using forces and energies from density functional theory (DFT) and (2) a
   fit to the theoretical EXAFS spectra generated from that same
   trajectory. Both harmonic and quasi-harmonic EXAFS fitting models are
   used to characterize the first-shell Au-Au bond length distribution. The
   harmonic model is found to significantly underestimate the coordination
   number, disorder, and bond length. The quasi-harmonic model, which
   includes the third cumulant of the first-shell bond length distribution,
   yields accurate bond lengths, but incorrectly predicts a decrease in
   particle size and little change in the disorder with increasing thiol
   ligands. A direct analysis of the MD data shows that the particle
   surfaces become much more disordered with ligand binding, and the high
   disorder is incorrectly interpreted by the EXAFS fitting models. Our DFT
   calculations compare well with experimental EXAFS measurements of Au
   nanoparticles, synthesized using a dendrimer encapsulation technique,
   showing that systematic errors in EXAFS fitting models apply to

Abstract = {{Neutral boundary layer (NBL) flow fields, commonly used in turbine load
   studies and design, are generated using spectral procedures in
   stochastic simulation. For large utility-scale turbines, stable boundary
   layer (SBL) flow fields are of great interest because they are often
   accompanied by enhanced wind shear, wind veer, and even low-level jets
   (LLJs). The generation of SBL flow fields, in contrast to simpler
   stochastic simulation for NBL, requires computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) procedures to capture the physics and noted characteristics-such
   as shear and veer-that are distinct from those seen in NBL flows. At
   present, large-eddy simulation (LES) is the most efficient CFD procedure
   for SBL flow field generation and related wind turbine loads studies.
   Design standards, such as from the International Electrotechnical
   Commission (IEC), provide guidance albeit with simplifying assumptions
   (one such deals with assuming constant variance of turbulence over the
   rotor) and recommend standard target turbulence power spectra and
   coherence functions to allow NBL flow field simulation. In contrast, a
   systematic SBL flow field simulation procedure has not been offered for
   design or for site assessment. It is instructive to compare
   LES-generated SBL flow fields with stochastic NBL flow fields and
   associated loads which we evaluate for a 5-MW turbine; in doing so, we
   seek to isolate distinguishing characteristics of wind shear, wind veer,
   and turbulence variation over the rotor plane in the alternative flow
   fields and in the turbine loads. Because of known differences in
   NBL-stochastic and SBL-LES wind fields but an industry preference for
   simpler stochastic simulation in design practice, this study
   investigates if one can reproduce stable atmospheric conditions using
   stochastic approaches with appropriate corrections for shear, veer,
   turbulence, etc. We find that such simple tuning cannot consistently
   match turbine target SBL load statistics, even though this is possible
   in some cases. As such, when there is a need to consider different
   stability regimes encountered by a wind turbine, easy solutions do not
   exist and large-eddy simulation at least for the stable boundary layer
   is needed.}},

Abstract = {{A new analytical model is developed and solved to reveal heat transfer
   mechanism during steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The new model
   is transformed to a boundary value problem (BVP) for second order
   ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to be solved. Moreover, a new
   relationship between oil saturation and dimensionless reservoir
   temperature is established and utilized to solve the model. The results
   reveal three main conclusions. Firstly, although the specific proportion
   of convection to conduction during heat transfer process is influenced
   by properties of rock and fluids in the reservoir, convective heat flux
   is more important than conductive heat flux near steam chamber edge
   (around 0-2 m). Secondly, convective heat flux decreases rapidly away
   from the chamber edge and quickly becomes negligible compared to
   conductive heat flux. As a result, the influence of convection on
   reservoir temperature is marginal during the whole heat transfer
   process. Thirdly, classic relationship between reservoir temperature and
   distance measured from the steam-chamber edge, which is developed under
   conductive heat transfer assumption, is still applicable when
   considering both conductive and convective heat transfer.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Several experimental techniques reported in recent years have enabled
   the measurement of thermal transport properties of nanostructures.
   However, eliminating the contact thermal resistance error from the
   measurement results has remained a critical challenge. Here, we report a
   different four-probe measurement method that can separately obtain both
   the intrinsic thermal conductance and the contact thermal resistance of
   individual nanostructures. The measurement device consists of four
   microfabricated, suspended metal lines that act as resistive heaters and
   thermometers, across which the nanostructure sample is assembled. The
   method takes advantage of the variation in the heat flow along the
   suspended nanostructure and across its contacts to the four suspended
   heater and thermometer lines, and uses sixteen sets of temperature and
   heat flow measurements to obtain nine of the thermal resistances in the
   measurement device and the nanostructure sample, including the intrinsic
   thermal resistance and the two contact thermal resistances to the middle
   suspended segment of the nanostructure. Two single crystalline Si
   nanowires with different cross sections are measured in this work to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. This four-probe thermal
   transport measurement method can lead to future discoveries of unique
   size-dependent thermal transport phenomena in nanostructures and
   low-dimensional materials, in addition to providing reliable
   experimental data for calibrating theoretical models. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Due to the health risk related to occupational air pollution exposure,
   we assessed concentrations and identified sources of particles and
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a handcraft workshop producing
   fishing lures. The work processes in the site included polyurethane
   molding, spray painting, lacquering, and gluing. We measured total VOC
   (TVOC) concentrations and particle size distributions at three locations
   representing the various phases of the manufacturing and assembly
   process. The mean working-hour TVOC concentrations in three locations
   studied were 41, 37, and 24 ppm according to photo-ionization detector
   measurements. The mean working-hour particle number concentration varied
   between locations from 3000 to 36,000 cm(-3). Analysis of temporal and
   spatial variations of TVOC concentrations revealed that there were at
   least four substantial VOC sources: spray gluing, mold-release agent
   spraying, continuous evaporation from various lacquer and paint
   containers, and either spray painting or lacquering (probably both). The
   mold-release agent spray was indirectly also a major source of ultrafine
   particles. The workers' exposure can be reduced by improving the local
   exhaust ventilation at the known sources and by increasing the
   ventilation rate in the area with the continuous source.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of crystals contain quasi-one-dimensional substructures, which
   yield distinctive electronic, spintronic, optical and thermoelectric
   properties. There is a lack of understanding of the lattice dynamics
   that influences the properties of such complex crystals. Here we employ
   inelastic neutron scatting measurements and density functional theory
   calculations to show that numerous low-energy optical vibrational modes
   exist in higher manganese silicides, an example of such crystals. These
   optical modes, including unusually low-frequency twisting motions of the
   Si ladders inside the Mn chimneys, provide a large phase space for
   scattering acoustic phonons. A hybrid phonon and diffuson model is
   proposed to explain the low and anisotropic thermal conductivity of
   higher manganese silicides and to evaluate nanostructuring as an
   approach to further suppress the thermal conductivity and enhance the
   thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency. This discovery offers new
   insights into the structure-property relationships of a broad class of
   materials with quasi-one-dimensional substructures for various

Abstract = {{In November 2013, a series of earthquakes began along a mapped ancient
   fault system near Azle, Texas. Here we assess whether it is plausible
   that human activity caused these earthquakes. Analysis of both lake and
   groundwater variations near Azle shows that no significant stress
   changes were associated with the shallow water table before or during
   the earthquake sequence. In contrast, pore-pressure models demonstrate
   that a combination of brine production and wastewater injection near the
   fault generated subsurface pressures sufficient to induce earthquakes on
   near-critically stressed faults. On the basis of modelling results and
   the absence of historical earthquakes near Azle, brine production
   combined with wastewater disposal represent the most likely cause of
   recent seismicity near Azle. For assessing the earthquake cause, our
   research underscores the necessity of monitoring subsurface wastewater
   formation pressures and monitoring earthquakes having magnitudes of
   similar to M2 and greater. Currently, monitoring at these levels is not
   standard across Texas or the United States.}},

Abstract = {{Background-We examined the influence of catheter ablation and
   periprocedural anticoagulation regimen on trajectory of migraine in
   atrial fibrillation patients with or without migraine history.
   Methods and Results-Forty patients with (group 1: 64+/-8 years; men
   78\%) and 85 (group 2: 61+/-10 years; men 73\%) without migraine history
   undergoing atrial fibrillation-ablation were enrolled. Migraine status
   and quality of life were evaluated using standardized questionnaires.
   Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of brain was performed for all at
   pre and 24 hours post procedure. Catheter ablation was performed with
   (88, 70\%) or without (37, 30\%) continuous warfarin treatment.
   Fifty-four patients (11 and 43 from groups 1 and 2, respectively) had
   subtherapeutic international normalized ratio on procedure day. At
   17+/-5 months follow-up, from group 1, 25 (63\%) reported no migraine,
   10 (25\%) had <1, and 3 (8\%) had 2 to 3 monthly symptoms. Intensity of
   pain decreased from baseline 7 (Q1-Q3, 4-8) to 2 (0-4) scale points at
   follow-up (P<0.001) and duration of headache from median 8 (Q1-Q3, 4-15)
   to 0.5 (Q1-Q3, 0-2) hours (P<0.001). Two patients from group 1 reported
   increased migraine severity and 2 from group 2 had new-onset migraine.
   Follow-up diffusion magnetic resonance imaging revealed new infarcts in
   9.6\% (12/125) patients; of which 11 had subtherapeutic preprocedural
   international normalized ratio on or off continuous warfarin. Quality of
   life improved significantly in patients with successful ablation, being
   more pronounced in group 1.
   Conclusions-In most patients, migraine symptoms improved substantially
   after catheter ablation. Interestingly, the only cases of new migraine
   and aggravation of pre-existent headache had subtherapeutic
   international normalized ratio during the procedure and new cerebral
   infarcts.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Delay line ADCs are becoming increasingly attractive with technology
   scaling to smaller dimensions with lower voltages. However, linearity,
   which has always been an issue, becomes a problem with longer delay
   lines. Resolutions of reported delay-line ADCs are hardly more than 4
   bits with sampling rates of hundreds of MHz. In this paper, we first
   present a technique which extends harmonic distortion correction
   techniques to digital calibration of a delay-line ADC. In our simulation
   results, digital calibration improves SNDR and SFDR to 42.5 dB and 45.4
   dB, respectively, compared with the original SNDR of 25.6 dB and the
   original SFDR of 25.7 dB. In order to reduce the convergence time of the
   calibration, we inject a periodic 3-bit gray code sequence instead of
   three pseudorandom numbers for harmonic distortion correction to
   digitally calibrate an 8-bit delay line ADC. In our simulation results,
   the SNDR is significantly improved from 25.6 dB to 42.5 dB, with a
   calibration time of 13.5 milliseconds, which is 64X faster than harmonic
   distortion correction with the pseudorandom numbers.}},

Title = {{What Is the State of the Art of Systematic Review in Engineering
   Education?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Background Systematic review refers to a growing set of research
   methodologies intended to critically appraise and synthesize research to
   inform policy and practice. Systematic review methods, widely used in
   fields such as medicine, psychology, and education, are being applied in
   engineering education. Analysis of current systematic review practices
   in engineering education can contribute to continuous improvement of an
   important set of synthesis methodologies.
   Purpose To promote continuous improvement in systematic reviews,
   researchers are currently developing criteria to evaluate the quality of
   systematic review methodologies. The purpose of this article is to
   identify prior systematic reviews in areas of interest to the
   engineering education community, use these criteria to critique these
   systematic reviews, and make recommendations for improving use and
   quality of systematic review methods in engineering education research.
   Scope/Method Using systematic review search methodologies, we identified
   12 conference papers and 37 journal articles that are systematic reviews
   published since 1990. Two reviewers coded each by topic, education
   level, quantitative or qualitative sources and synthesis methods, and 18
   quantitative measures of review quality. Interrater reliability was
   calculated using kappa as described by Landis and Koch, which ranged
   from 0.43 (moderate) to 0.80 (almost perfect) with overall agreement of
   0.64 (substantial).
   Conclusions We found that the 49 identified systematic reviews in
   engineering education are particularly strong in stating their purposes,
   rationale, and inclusion criteria. They can be improved by explaining
   reasons for excluding studies, appraising quality of included studies,
   engaging multiple coders in evaluation procedures, stating their
   limitations, and, in the case of meta-analyses, describing statistical
   methods in greater detail.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallization chaperones are attracting increasing interest as a route
   to crystal growth and structure elucidation of difficult targets such as
   membrane proteins. While strategies to date have typically employed
   protein-specific chaperones, a peptide-specific chaperone to crystallize
   multiple cognate peptide epitope-containing client proteins is
   envisioned. This would eliminate the target-specific
   chaperone-production step and streamline the co-crystallization process.
   Previously, protein engineering and directed evolution were used to
   generate a single-chain variable (scFv) antibody fragment with affinity
   for the peptide sequence EYMPME (scFv/EE). This report details the
   conversion of scFv/EE to an anti-EE Fab format (Fab/EE) followed by its
   biophysical characterization. The addition of constant chains increased
   the overall stability and had a negligible impact on the antigen
   affinity. The 2.0 angstrom resolution crystal structure of Fab/EE
   reveals contacts with larger surface areas than those of scFv/EE.
   Surface plasmon resonance, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and
   size-exclusion chromatography were used to assess Fab/EE binding to
   EE-tagged soluble and membrane test proteins: namely, the beta-barrel
   outer membrane protein intimin and beta-helical A2a G protein-coupled
   receptor (A(2)aR). Molecular-dynamics simulation of the intimin
   constructs with and without Fab/EE provides insight into the energetic
   complexities of the co-crystallization approach.}},

Abstract = {{Complete utilization of all available carbon sources in lignocellulosic
   biomass still remains a challenge in engineering Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae. Even with efficient heterologous xylose catabolic pathways,
   S. cerevisiae is unable to utilize xylose in lignocellulosic biomass
   unless xylan is depolymerized to xylose. Here we demonstrate that a
   blended bioprospecting approach along with pathway engineering and
   evolutionary engineering can be used to improve xylan catabolism in S.
   cerevisiae. Specifically, we perform whole genome sequencing-based
   bioprospecting of a strain with remarkable pentose catabolic potential
   that we isolated and named Ustilago bevomyces. The heterologous
   expression of xylan catabolic genes enabled S. cerevisiae to grow on
   xylan as a single carbon source in minimal medium. A combination of
   bioprospecting and metabolic pathway evolution demonstrated that the
   xylan catabolic pathway could be further improved. Ultimately,
   engineering efforts were able to achieve xylan conversion into ethanol
   of up to 0.22 g/L on minimal medium compositions with xylan. This
   pathway provides a novel starting point for improving lignocellulosic
   conversion by yeast.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design and realization of anisotropic mantle cloaks
   operating, at the same frequency, for both TM and TE incident
   polarizations. Starting from the analytical model of metasurfaces
   available in the literature, we first explore the potentials and
   limitations of the most common metasurface geometries for their
   application as mantle cloaks. Then, we introduce new types of patterned
   surfaces aimed at improving their polarization response. We demonstrate
   that, only by using four metasurface topologies, it is possible to
   obtain all required combinations of positive and negative reactance
   values in order to design effective mantle cloaks for planar,
   cylindrical, and three-dimensional (3-D) objects. We also show that the
   accuracy of the analytical formulas commonly used to design such
   metasurfaces is not necessarily sufficient for cloaking purposes.
   Therefore, we introduce and validate a numerical procedure to refine the
   analytical design and optimize the cloak performance. The effectiveness
   of the designed covers is checked with full-wave simulations. Finally,
   some antenna applications of dual-polarized mantle cloaks are proposed
   and several experimental measurements conducted on fabricated prototypes
   are also provided.}},

Abstract = {{Silent Cerebral Events/Lesions Related to AF Ablation Brain magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) has identified a high incidence of cerebral
   ischemia in asymptomatic patients after atrial fibrillation (AF)
   ablation (silent). Detection of cerebral ischemic events on MRI is based
   on acute hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging. In the
   literature, the incidence is related to specifications of MRI and
   depends on the definition applied. In comparative studies, silent
   cerebral events (SCE, diffusion-weighted MRI {[}DWI] positive only)
   appear to be approximately 3 times more common compared to using a
   definition of silent cerebral lesions (SCL; without fluid attenuated
   inverse recovery sequence {[}FLAIR] positivity). Whereas the FLAIR
   sequence may turn positive within days after the ischemic event, SCE
   definition is highly sensitive for early phases of ischemic brain
   damage. SCE/SCL appear to represent cerebral ischemic infarcts and
   determine the embolic fingerprint of a specific ablation technology and
   strategy used. The optimum time point for detecting SCE is early after
   AF ablation (24-72 hours), whereas detection of SCL can only be
   performed within the first 2-7 days (due to delay of FLAIR positivity).
   Different technology-, procedure-, and patient-related parameters have
   been identified to play a role in the multifactorial genesis of SCE/SCL.
   In recent years, evidence has been gathered that there may be
   differences of SCE/SCL rates depending upon the ablation technology
   used, but small patient numbers and a large number of potential
   confounders hamper all studies. As major findings of recent studies,
   mode of periprocedural and intraprocedural anticoagulation has been
   identified as a major predictor for incidences of SCE/SCL. Whereas
   procedural characteristics related to higher SCE/SCL-rates may be
   modified, unchangeable patient-related factors should be taken into
   account for future individualized risk assessment. Novel ablation
   devices introduced into the market should be tested for their potential
   embolic fingerprint and refinements of ablation procedures to reduce
   their embolic potential should be prompted. The knowledge of best
   practice in terms of low SCE/SCL rates has prompted changes in
   work-flow, which have been implemented into ablation procedures using
   novel ablation devices. So far, no study has linked SCE/SCL to
   neuropsychological decline and the low number of AF-ablation-associated
   events needs to be weighted against the multitude of preexisting
   asymptomatic MRI-detected brain lesions related to the course of AF
   itself. Future studies are needed to evaluate if more white matter
   hyperintensities due to AF may be prevented by AF ablation (producing
   only a small number of SCE/SCL).}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) surface imaging of breasts is usually done with
   the patient in an upright position, which does not permit comparison Of
   changes in breast morphology with changes in position of the torso. In
   theory, these limitations may be eliminated if the 3D camera system
   could remain fixed relative to the woman's torso as she is tilted from 0
   to 90 degrees. We mounted a 3dMDtorso imaging system onto a bariatric
   tilt table to image breasts at different tilt angles. The images were
   validated using a rigid plastic mannequin and the metrics compared to
   breast metrics obtained from five subjects with diverse morphology. The
   differences between distances between the same fiducial marks differed
   between the supine and upright positions by less than 1\% for the
   mannequin, whereas the differences for distances between the same
   fiducial marks on the breasts of the five subjects differed
   significantly and could be correlated with body mass index and brassiere
   cup size for each position change. We show that a tilt table-3D imaging
   system can be used to determine quantitative changes in the morphology
   of ptotic breasts when the subject is tilted to various angles. (C) 2015

   these light cosolvents greatly improve the phase behavior in a way that
   can be tailored to a particular oil, temperature, and salinity. This new
   chemical enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) technology uses polymer for
   mobility control and has been termed alkali/cosolvent/polymer (ACP)
   flooding. ACP corefloods perform as well as alkaline/surfactant/polymer
   (ASP) corefloods while being simpler and more robust. We report 12
   successful ACP corefloods using four different crude oils ranging from
   12 to 24 degrees API. The ACP process shows special promise for heavy
   oils, which tend to have large fractions of soap-forming acidic
   components, but is applicable across a wide range of oil gravity.}},

Title = {{History Matching Heterogeneous Coreflood of CO2/Brine by Use of
   Compositional Reservoir Simulator and Geostatistical Approach}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Numerical modeling and simulation are essential tools for developing a
   better understanding of the geologic characteristics of aquifers and
   providing technical support for future carbon dioxide (CO2) storage
   projects. Modeling CO2 sequestration in underground aquifers requires
   the implementation of models of multiphase flow and CO2 and brine phase
   behavior. Capillary pressure and relative permeability need to be
   consistent with permeability/porosity variations of the rock. It is,
   therefore, crucial to gain confidence in the numerical models by
   validating the models and results by use of laboratory and field pilot
   results. A published CO2/brine laboratory coreflood was selected for our
   simulation study. The experimental results include subcore porosity and
   CO2-saturation distributions by means of a computed tomography (CT)
   scanner along with a CO2-saturation histogram. Data used in this paper
   are all based on those provided by Krause et al. (2011), with the
   exception of the CT porosity data. We generated a heterogeneous
   distribution for the porosity but honoring the mean value provided by
   Krause et al. (2011). We also generated the permeability distribution
   with the mean value for the whole core given by Krause et al. (2011).
   All the other data, such as the core dimensions, injection rate, outlet
   pressure, temperature, relative permeability, and capillary pressure,
   are the same as those in Krause et al. (2011). High-resolution coreflood
   simulations of brine displacement with supercritical CO2 are presented
   with the compositional reservoir simulator IPARS (Wheeler and Wheeler
   1990). A 3D synthetic core model was constructed with permeability and
   porosity distributions generated by use of the geostatistical software
   FFTSIM {[}Jennings et al. (2000)], with cell sizes of 1: 27 x 1: 27 x 6:
   35 mm.
   The core was initially saturated with brine. Fluid properties were
   calibrated with the equation-of-state (EOS) compositional model to match
   the measured data provided by Krause et al. (2011). We used their
   measured capillary pressure and relative permeability curves. However,
   we scaled capillary pressure on the basis of the Leverett J-function
   (Leverett 1941) for permeability, porosity, and interfacial tension
   (IFT) in every simulation grid cell.
   Saturation images provide insight into the role of heterogeneity of CO2
   distribution in which a slight variation in porosity gives rise to large
   variations in CO2-saturation distribution in the core. High-resolution
   numerical results indicated that accurate representation of capillary
   pressure at small scales was critical. Residual brine saturation and the
   subsequent shift in the relative permeability curves showed a
   significant impact on final CO2 distribution in the core.}},

Abstract = {{Ni-rich layered oxides (Ni content >60\%) are promising cathode
   candidates for Li-ion batteries because of their high discharge
   capacity, high energy density, and low cost. However, fast capacity
   fading, poor thermal stability, and sensitivity to the ambient moisture
   still plague their mass application. In this work, we systematically
   investigate the effects of Mn content on the structure, morphology,
   electrochemical performance, and thermal stability of the Ni-rich
   cathode materials LiNi0.8-xCo0.1Mn0.1+xO2 (0.0 = x = 0.08). It is
   demonstrated that with the increase in Mn content and decrease in Ni
   content, the cycling stability of LiNi(0.8-x)Co(0.1)Mn(0.1+)xO(2) to a
   cutoff charge voltage of 4.5 V is significantly improved. The
   high-Mn-content electrode LiNi0.72Co0.10Mn0.18O2 shows a capacity
   retention of 85.7\% after 100 cycles at a 0.2 C rate at room
   temperature, much higher than those of the lower Mn-content samples
   LiNi0.80Co0.10Mn0.10O2 (64.0\%) and LiNi0.76Co0.10Mn0.14O2 (72.9\%). The
   improved capacity retention of the high-Mn-content electrode
   LiNi0.72Co0.10Mn0.18O2 is due to the stabilization of the
   electrode/electrolyte interface, as evidenced by the lower
   solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) resistance and charge-transfer
   resistance. Furthermore, with the increase in Mn content and decrease in
   Ni content, the thermal stability of the Ni-rich cathode is also
   remarkably enhanced.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of soft tissue fiber orientation is fundamental to
   pathophysiology and biomechanical function in a multitude of biomedical
   applications. However, many existing techniques for quantifying fiber
   structure rely on transmitted light, limiting general applicability and
   often requiring tissue processing. Herein, we present a novel wide-field
   reflectance-based imaging modality, which combines polarized light
   imaging (PLI) and spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to rapidly
   quantify preferred fiber orientation on soft collagenous tissues. PLI
   utilizes the polarization dependent scattering property of fibers to
   determine preferred fiber orientation; SFDI imaging at high spatial
   frequency is introduced to reject the highly diffuse photons and to
   control imaging depth. As a result, photons scattered from the
   superficial layer of a multi-layered sample are highlighted. Thus, fiber
   orientation quantification can be achieved for the superficial layer
   with optical sectioning. We demonstrated on aortic heart valve leaflet
   that, at spatial frequency of f = 1mm(-1), the diffuse background can be
   effectively rejected and the imaging depth can be limited, thus
   improving quantification accuracy. (C)2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Surface diffusion plays a key role in gas mass transfer due to the
   majority of adsorbed gas within abundant nanopores of organic matter in
   shale gas reservoirs. Surface diffusion simulation is very complex as a
   result of high reservoir pressure, surface heterogeneity, and
   nonisothermal desorption in shale gas reservoirs. In this paper, a new
   model of surface diffusion for adsorbed gas in shale gas reservoirs is
   established, which is based on a Hwang model derived under a low
   pressure condition and considers the effect of adsorbed gas coverage
   under high pressure. Additionally, this new model considers the effects
   of surface heterogeneity, isosteric sorption heat, and nonisothermal gas
   desorption. Results show that (1) the surface diffusion coefficient
   increases with pressure and temperature, while it decreases with
   activation energy and gas molecular weight; (2) contributions of viscous
   flow, Knudsen diffusion, and surface diffusion to the total gas mass
   transfer are varying during the development of shale gas reservoirs,
   which are mainly controlled by nanopore-scale and pressure; (3) in
   micropores (pore radius of <2 nm), the contribution of surface diffusion
   to the gas mass transfer is dominant, up to 92.95\%; in macropores (pore
   radius of >50 nm), the contribution is less than 4.39\%, which is
   negligible; in mesopores (2 nm < pore radius < 50 nm), the contribution
   is between micropores and macropores.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a simple and effective method for selecting the
   maximum feedback gains in PD-type controllers applied to actuators where
   feedback delay and derivative signal filtering are present. The method
   provides the maximum feedback parameters that satisfy a phase margin
   criteria, producing a closed-loop system with high stability and a
   dynamic response with near-minimum settling time. Our approach is unique
   in that it simultaneously possesses: (1) a model of real-world
   performance-limiting factors (i.e., filtering and delay), (2) the
   ability to meet performance and stability criteria, and (3) the
   simplicity of a single closed-form expression. A central focus of our
   approach is the characterization of system stability through exhaustive
   searches of the feedback parameter space. Using this search-based
   method, we locate a set of maximum feedback parameters based on a phase
   margin criteria. We then fit continuous equations to this data and
   obtain a closed-form expression which matches the sampled data to within
   2-4\% error for the majority of the parameter space. We apply our
   feedback parameter selection method to two real-world actuators with
   widely differing system properties and show that our method successfully
   produces the maximum achievable nonoscillating impedance response.}},

Abstract = {{The microfabrication, modeling, and experimental evaluation of an
   unconventional acoustic sensor are described. The sensor is comprised of
   two vacuum-sealed capacitively transduced pistons coupled with each
   other by a pivoting beam. The use of a pivoting beam can, in principle,
   enable high rotational compliance to in-plane small-signal acoustic
   pressure gradients, while resisting piston collapse against large
   background atmospheric pressure. A design path toward vacuum-sealed
   surface-micromachined broadband microphones is a motivation to explore
   the sensor concept. Fabrication of surface-micromachined prototypes is
   presented, followed by finite element modeling and experimental
   confirmation of successful vacuum sealing. Dynamic frequency response
   measurements are obtained using broadband electrostatic actuation and
   confirm a first fundamental rocking mode near 250 kHz. Successful
   reception of airborne ultrasound in air at 130 kHz is also demonstrated,
   and followed by a discussion of design paths toward improved
   signal-to-noise ratio beyond that of the initial prototypes presented.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional silicon waveguides are defined by waveguide trenches on
   either side of the high-index silicon core that leads to fluid leakage
   orifices for over-layed microfluidic channels. Closing the orifices
   needs additional fabrication steps which may include oxide deposition
   and planarization. We experimentally demonstrated a new type of
   microfluidic channel design with ultralow-loss waveguide crossings
   (0.00248 dB per crossings). The waveguide crossings and all other
   on-chip passive-waveguide components are fabricated in one step with no
   additional planarization steps which eliminates any orifices and leads
   to leak-free fluid flow. Such designs are applicable in all
   optical-waveguide-based sensing applications where the analyte must be
   flowed over the sensor. The new channel design was demonstrated in a L55
   photonic crystal sensor operating between 1540 and 1580 nm. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Commuter rail systems are being introduced into many urban areas as an
   alternative mode to automobiles for commuting trips. It is anticipated
   that the shift from the auto mode to rail mode can greatly help
   alleviate traffic congestion in urban road networks. However, the
   right-of-way of many existing commuter rail systems is usually not
   ideally located. Since the locations of rail systems were typically
   chosen long ago to serve the needs of freight customers, the majority of
   current commuter rail passengers have to take a non-walkable connecting
   trip to reach their final destinations after departing the most
   conveniently located rail stations. To make rail a more viable commuting
   option and thus more competitive to the auto mode, a bus feeder or
   circulator system is proposed for transporting passengers from their
   departing rail stations to final work destinations in a seamless
   transfer manner. The key research question with operating such a bus
   circulator system is how to optimally determine a bus route and stopping
   sequence for each circulating tour by using the real-time demand
   information. In this paper, we name this joint routing and stopping
   optimization problem the circulator service network design problem, the
   objective of which is to minimize the total tour cost incurred to bus
   passengers and operators with respect to minimizing the walk time of
   each individual bus passenger. A bi-level nonlinear mixed integer
   programming model is constructed and a tabu search method with different
   local search strategies and neighborhood evaluation methods is then
   developed for tackling the circulator service network design problem.

Abstract = {{Few biologists have studied the evolutionary processes at work in indoor
   environments. Yet indoor environments comprise approximately 0.5\% of
   ice-free land area - an area as large as the subtropical coniferous

   studies. After defining the indoor biome and tracing its deep history,
   we discuss some of its evolutionary dimensions. We restrict our examples
   to the species found in human houses - a subset of the environments
   constituting the indoor biome - and offer preliminary hypotheses to
   advance the study of indoor evolution. Studies of the indoor biome are
   situated at the intersection of evolutionary ecology, anthropology,
   architecture, and human ecology and are well suited for citizen science
   projects, public outreach, and large-scale international collaborations.}},

Abstract = {{With aggressive technology scaling and complex design scenarios, timing
   closure has become a challenging and tedious job for the designers.
   Timing violations persist for multi-corner, multi-mode designs in the
   deep-routing stage although careful optimization has been applied at
   every step after synthesis. Useful clock skew optimization has been
   suggested as an effective way to achieve design convergence and timing
   closure. Existing approaches on useful skew optimization: 1) calculate
   clock skew at sequential elements before the actual tree is synthesized
   and 2) do not account for the implementability of the calculated
   schedules at the later stages of design cycle. In this paper, we propose
   a novel clock tree resynthesis methodology which is based on a skew
   scheduling engine which works on an already built clock tree. The output
   of the engine is a set of positive and negative offsets which translate
   to the delay and accelerations, respectively in clock arrival at the
   clock tree pins. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the offsets at the
   output pins of the leaf-level clock drivers in comparison to the
   traditional clock scheduling in the clock pins of the flip-flops due to
   the better implementability and lesser area overhead and present an
   algorithm to accurately realize these offsets in the clock tree.
   Experimental results on large-scale industrial designs demonstrate that
   our clock tree resynthesis methodology achieves respectively 57\%, 12\%,
   and 42\% average improvement in total negative slack, worst negative
   slack, and failure-end-point with an average overhead of 26\% in clock
   tree area. We also experimentally study the impact of
   on-chip-variation-derates on our approach in terms of the timing metric
   improvement and clock tree overhead.}},

Title = {{Conditional Range Metric for Determining Wind Power Variability of

Abstract = {{Understanding the nature and characteristics of wind power variability
   is critical to improving power system operations. Using a relatively
   large volume of measured wind power time series, the conditional range
   metric (CRM) has successfully been employed to quantify intra-hour wind
   power variability. The objective of this paper is to extend the
   application of the CRM-based method to sparsely sampled wind power time
   series. To improve the accuracy and adaptability of the CRM, a gamma
   distribution is proposed to model the power-deviation series without
   introducing the joint probability density matrix. The shape and inverse
   scale parameters a and beta of the gamma distribution are calculated by
   the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) at each production level.
   Bayesian estimators (BEs) for a and beta are then developed as a
   posterior joint distribution to calculate their expectations by taking
   the mean value of the paired sample points via a modified rejection
   sampling strategy. The match between the two estimation results
   indicates a valid assumption of the likelihood distribution and exact
   estimated parameters. Applying data from the National Renewable Energy
   Laboratory and their down-sampled subsets, the efficacy of the proposed
   CRM with the gamma distribution approach is compared to that of the
   existing CRM with a quantile model.}},

Title = {{The effect of CNT functionalization on electrical and relaxation

Abstract = {{The effect of the type of CNT (functionalized and non-functionalized) on
   the dielectric relaxation phenomena and conductivity of MWCNT/chitosan
   (MWCNT/CS) was investigated. Composites were prepared by the solvent
   cast method by homogeneously dispersing CNT into a CS matrix. FTIR
   analysis suggests the formation of hydrogen bonding in
   functionalized-MWCNT/CS whereas the CS remains unaffected in
   non-functionalized films. In the low conductivity region, the
   alpha-relaxation process associated with a glass transition in CS is
   affected by the MWCNT; the Vogel temperature increases due to a decrease
   of the water content. The sigma-relaxation exhibits a typical
   Arrhenius-type temperature dependence that is independent on the
   moisture content. Strong interfacial interactions of
   functionalized-MWCNT with the CS matrix are responsible for high values
   of the contact resistance R-c between individual CNT. Conversely,
   non-functionalized MWCNTs exhibit a typical 3D percolation threshold at
   ca. 4 wt \%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A general analytical solution for the one-dimensional
   advective-dispersive-reactive solute transport equation in multilayered
   porous media is presented. The model allows an arbitrary number of
   layers, parameter values, and initial concentration distributions. The
   separation of variables technique was employed to derive the analytical
   solution. Hyperbolic eigenfunctions, as well as traditional
   trigonometric eigenfunctions, were found to contribute an important part
   to the series solution and were not included in some existing solutions.
   The closed-form analytical solution was verified against a numerical
   solution from a finite difference-based approach and an existing
   solution derived from general integral transform technique (GITT). The
   solution has several important advantages over the GITT technique and
   other existing solutions. The limitations of existing solutions and the
   ability of the current solution to address those limitations are
   identified. Among other applications, the current analytical solution
   will be useful for modeling the transport of contaminants in sediments
   and, particularly for the design of layered caps as a remedial approach.
   The analytical solution also has significant advantages over numerical
   solutions for sensitivity analyses and the solution of inverse problems.}},

Journal = {{AIAA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{817-831}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A process was demonstrated that enables more meaningful comparisons of
   experimental and large-eddy simulation results of the same flowfield.
   This approach was motivated by recent studies, which show the importance
   of modeling the measurement device or process when making comparisons of
   this nature. In the current case, a large-eddy simulation of a Mach 5
   inlet/isolator flow is the subject of the validation process, a flow
   that was previously validated using particle image velocimetry
   measurements. In the present study, the particle image velocimetry
   measurement process is emulated by adding particles with inertia to the
   large-eddy simulation and using synthetic particle image velocimetry to
   mimic the process by which velocity data are extracted. Analysis of the
   particle response reveals modifications to the underlying flow
   consistent with the original particle image velocimetry measurements,
   including a drastic decrease in rms velocities in the vicinity of
   shockwaves and weaker velocity gradients throughout the flow. The
   synthetic particle image velocimetry is found to capture the sampled
   particle velocities quite well but does impart a significant bias error
   to the regions near the walls, also consistent with the experimental
   data. Furthermore, this process suggests improvements that could be made
   to any new experiment to achieve higher accuracy and thus improve the
   validation process.}},

Abstract = {{The robot manipulation in human environment is a challenging issue
   because the human environment is complex, dynamic, unstructured, and
   difficult to perceive reliably. In order to implement promising robot
   applications in our daily lives, robots need to perform manipulation
   tasks within human environment. Particularly for a humanoid robot, the
   manipulability of the objects is essential to assist the humans in human
   environment. This paper presents a method for manipulating an object
   with both arms of a humanoid robot. We focus on the generation of
   human-like movements by using the human motion capture data. Then, the
   control method based on the virtual dynamics model is proposed to
   control both the motion and force under the uniform control system. This
   method empowers the robot to perform the object manipulation task
   including reaching, grasping, and moving an object in sequence. The
   proposed algorithm is implemented on a humanoid robot with independent
   joint controller at each motor; its performance is demonstrated by
   manipulating an object with both arms.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) test procedures and length-change measuring devices on
   the measured CTE values. Twenty different coarse aggregate sources were
   tested using the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the
   American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
   (AASHTO) suggested CTE methods. Two different types of length-change
   measuring devices, linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) and
   differential variable reluctance transducers (DVRTs), were used. No
   significant effects of length-change measuring devices were observed on
   the CTE values measured by the TxDOT method. However, the test methods
   have shown effects on the measured values. The TxDOT method yields
   higher CTE values than the AASHTO method. Data obtained in this study
   confirmed that the internal water pressure development during the
   heating and cooling cycles is one of the potential reasons. Internal
   water pressure can significantly affect the CTE of concrete. Further
   investigation is needed to determine the effect of internal water
   pressure on the CTE, which affects the design and service life of

Abstract = {{SnSb-TiC-C nanocomposite alloy anodes for lithium-ion batteries have

   Characterization of the formed nanocomposites using x-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) reveals that these alloys are composed of crystalline
   nanoparticles of SnSb dispersed in a matrix of crystalline TiC and
   amorphous carbon. The SnSb-TiC-C alloy shows an initial gravimetric
   capacity of 769 mAh g(-1) (1385 mAh cm(-3)), an initial coulombic
   efficiency of 84.9\%, and a tap density of 1.8 g cm(-3). The buffer
   matrix of TiC and carbon in the nanocomposite alloy anodes accommodates
   the large volume change occurring during the charge-discharge process
   and leads to enhanced cyclability compared to pure SnSb anodes as well

Abstract = {{We sought to understand how users interpret meanings of symbols commonly
   used in information systems, especially how icons are processed by the
   brain. We investigated Chinese and English speakers' processing of 4
   types of visual stimuli: icons, pictures, Chinese characters, and
   English words. The goal was to examine, via functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the hypothesis that people cognitively
   process icons as logographic words and to provide neurological evidence
   related to human-computer interaction (HCI), which has been rare in
   traditional information system studies. According to the neuroimaging
   data of 19 participants, we conclude that icons are not cognitively
   processed as logographical words like Chinese characters, although they
   both stimulate the semantic system in the brain that is needed for
   language processing. Instead, more similar to images and pictures, icons
   are not as efficient as words in conveying meanings, and brains (people)
   make more effort to process icons than words. We use this study to
   demonstrate that it is practicable to test information system constructs
   such as elements of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with neuroscience
   data and that, with such data, we can better understand individual or
   group differences related to system usage and user-computer

Title = {{A filtration model for evaluating maximum penetration distance of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a filtration model for evaluating the maximum
   penetration distance of chemically modified bentonite grouts.
   High-concentration bentonite grouts require chemical modifications to
   increase its penetration through soils; however, this modification
   complicates the evaluation of the maximum penetration distance due to
   the changes in the physicochemical and rheological properties of the
   bentonite grout. In this study, the yield stresses of 7.5\%, 10\%, and
   12\% bentonite grouts modified by 1-4\% sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) (by
   dry weight of bentonite) were determined by matching a constitutive
   model (Herschel-Bulkley model) to the shear stress-shear rate curves
   obtained through rheological tests. The bentonite grouts were injected
   into sand columns with an injection pressure of 35 or 140 kPa. The
   maximum penetration distances of the bentonite grouts through the sand
   columns were calculated using analytical equations (based on the yield
   stress of the grouts), and then compared to the measured maximum
   penetration distances. The results showed that the analytical equations
   could capture the maximum penetration distance at high yield stress
   (greater than 28 Pa), but the equations significantly overestimated the
   maximum penetration distance at low yield stress due to filtration. A
   new filtration model is presented in this study to estimate the maximum
   penetration distance of the SPP modified bentonite grouts that can
   provide better prediction, particularly for grouts having low yield
   stresses. The model was calibrated based on the 1-D column tests and
   then independently validated with an additional set of column tests
   using a bentonite with different chemical composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   perturbations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{301-308}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Of interest here is the influence of loading rate on the stability of
   structures where inertia is taken into account. The approach currently
   used in the literature to analyze these stability problems, is the
   method of modal analysis that determines the structure's fastest growing
   wavelength, which is meaningful only for cases where the velocity of the
   perfect structure is significantly lower than the associated
   characteristic wave propagation speeds. The novel idea here is to
   analyze the time-dependent response to perturbations of the transient
   (high strain rates) states of these structures, in order to understand
   the initiation of the corresponding failure mechanisms.
   We are motivated by the recent experimental studies of Zhang and
   Ravi-Chandar (2006) on the high strain rate extension of thin rings that
   show no evidence of a dominant wavelength in their failure mode and no
   influence of strain-rate sensitivity on the necking strains. In the
   interest of analytical tractability, we study the extension of an
   incompressible, nonlinearly elastic bar at different strain rates. The
   dynamic stability of these bars is studied by following the evolution of
   localized small perturbations introduced at different times. It is shown
   that these structures are stable until the static necking strain is
   reached at some point. Moreover their failure pattern is dictated by the
   distribution of defects, the minimum distance between necks diminishes
   with increasing strain rate and there is no dominant wavelength mode,
   exactly as observed experimentally in Zhang and Ravi-Chandar (2006). (C)

Title = {{Analytical solutions for bonded elastically compressible layers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{353-365}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Compression of elastic layers bonded between parallel plates often find
   applications in the mechanical characterization of soft materials or the
   transfer-printing of nanomembranes with polymeric stamps. In addition,
   annular rubbery gaskets and sealers are often under uniaxial compression
   during service. Analysis of elastic layers under compression has been
   focused on nearly incompressible materials such as rubbers, and
   empirical assumptions of displacements were adopted for simplicity. For
   compressible materials, solutions obtained by the method of averaged
   equilibrium are sufficient for effective compression modulus but
   inaccurate for the displacement or stress fields whereas solutions
   obtained by the method of series expansion are considerably complicated.
   In this paper, we report full field, closed-form solutions for bonded
   elastic layers (disks, annuli, annuli with rigid shafts, infinitely long
   strips) in compression using separation of variables without any
   pre-assumed deformation profile. These solutions can satisfy the exact
   forms of the equilibrium equations and all essential boundary conditions
   as well as the weak form of the natural boundary conditions. Therefore
   the predicted stress, displacement, and effective modulus have found
   excellent agreement with finite element modeling (FEM) results over a
   wide range of Poisson's ratio and aspect ratio. The analytical and FEM
   results of the stress, displacement, and effective modulus are highly
   sensitive to Poisson's ratio, especially near 0.5. Therefore we also
   propose a viable means to simultaneously measure the intrinsic Young's
   modulus and Poisson's ratio of elastically compressible layers without
   camera settings. When Poisson's ratio approaches 0.5, our solutions can
   degenerate to classical solutions for incompressible elastic layers. (C)

Abstract = {{The most common cause of death in the developed world is cardiovascular
   disease. For decades, this has provided a powerful motivation to study
   the effects of mechanical forces on vascular cells in a controlled
   setting, since these cells have been implicated in the development of
   disease. Early efforts in the 1970 s included the first use of a
   parallel-plate flow system to apply shear stress to endothelial cells
   (ECs) and the development of uniaxial substrate stretching techniques
   (Krueger et al., 1971, ``An in Vitro Study of Flow Response by
   Cells,{''} J. Biomech., 4(1), pp. 31-36 and Meikle et al., 1979, ``
   Rabbit Cranial Sutures in Vitro: A New Experimental Model for Studying
   the Response of Fibrous Joints to Mechanical Stress,{''} Calcif. Tissue
   Int., 28(2), pp. 13-144). Since then, a multitude of in vitro devices
   have been designed and developed for mechanical stimulation of vascular
   cells and tissues in an effort to better understand their response to in
   vivo physiologic mechanical conditions. This article reviews the
   functional attributes of mechanical bioreactors developed in the 21st
   century, including their major advantages and disadvantages. Each of
   these systems has been categorized in terms of their primary loading
   modality: fluid shear stress (FSS), substrate distention, combined
   distention and fluid shear, or other applied forces. The goal of this
   article is to provide researchers with a survey of useful methodologies
   that can be adapted to studies in this area, and to clarify future
   possibilities for improved research methods.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of predicted loads on offshore wind turbines depends on the
   mathematical models employed to describe the combined action of the wind
   and waves. Using a global simulation framework that employs a
   domain-decomposition strategy for computational efficiency, this study
   investigates the effects of nonlinear waves on computed loads on the
   support structure (monopile) and the rotor-nacelle assembly of a
   bottom-supported offshore wind turbine. The fully nonlinear (FNL)
   numerical wave solver is invoked only on subdomains where nonlinearities
   are detected; thus, only locally in space and time, a linear solution
   (and associated Morison hydrodynamics) is replaced by the FNL one. An
   efficient carefully tuned linear-nonlinear transition scheme makes it
   possible to run long simulations such that effects from weakly nonlinear
   up to FNL events, such as imminent breaking waves, can be accounted for.
   The unsteady nonlinear free-surface problem governing the propagation of
   gravity waves is formulated using potential theory and a higher-order
   boundary element method (HOBEM) is used to discretize Laplace's
   equation. The FNL solver is employed and associated hydrodynamic loads
   are simulated in conjunction with aerodynamic loads on the rotor of a
   5-MW wind turbine using the NREL open-source software, FAST. We assess
   load statistics associated with a single severe sea state. Such load
   statistics are needed in evaluating relevant load cases specified in
   offshore wind turbine design guidelines; in this context, the influence
   of nonlinear wave modeling and its selection over alternative linear or
   linearized wave modeling is compared. Ultimately, a study such as this
   one will seek to evaluate long-term loads using the FNL solver in
   computations directed toward reliability-based design of offshore wind
   turbines where a range of sea states will need to be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The leading edge of a turbine vane is subject to some of the highest
   temperature loading within an engine, and an accurate understanding of
   leading edge film coolant behavior is essential for modern engine
   design. Although there have been many investigations of the adiabatic
   effectiveness for showerhead film cooling of a vane leading edge region,
   there have been no previous studies in which individual rows of the
   showerhead were tested with the explicit intent of validating
   superposition models. For the current investigation, a series of
   adiabatic effectiveness experiments were performed with a five-row and
   three-row showerhead. The experiments were repeated separately with each
   individual row of holes active. This allowed evaluation of superposition
   methods on both the suction side of the vane, which was moderately
   convex, and the pressure side of the vane, which was mildly concave.
   Superposition was found to accurately predict performance on the suction
   side of the vane at lower momentum flux ratios, but not at higher
   momentum flux ratios. On the pressure side of the vane, the
   superposition predictions were consistently lower than measured values,
   with significant errors occurring at the higher momentum flux ratios.
   Reasons for the underprediction by superposition analysis are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic properties of graphene films depend on the number of
   atomic layers and the stacking sequence between the layers. One method
   of growing graphene films that are more than one atomic layer thick is
   by chemical vapor deposition on metal substrates that have
   non-negligible carbon solubility. This allows precipitation of carbon
   from the bulk during the cooling phase of the growth process. In this
   study, graphene films were grown on foil substrates composed of a CuNi
   alloy with a nominal bulk composition of 90:10 by weight. To determine
   the average thickness of the graphene films, angle-resolved X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy was used. For films grown at 1050 degrees C
   for 5, 25, and 50 min on the CuNi substrates, thicknesses of 1.06 +/-
   0.14, 1.19 +/- 0.13, and 1.87 +/- 0.13 monolayers were measured,
   respectively. Scanning electron microscopy was used to measure the
   growth morphology of the graphene films and provided a method of
   confirming the coverages determined by the analysis of the photoemission
   data. Ultra-violet Raman spectroscopy measurements were also performed
   on the graphene films, and it was found that the G-peak intensity
   increases and the frequency decreases with graphene thickness. (C) 2014

Title = {{Discretely Exact Derivatives for Hyperbolic PDE-Constrained Optimization
   Problems Discretized by the Discontinuous Galerkin Method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses the computation of derivatives for optimization
   problems governed by linear hyperbolic systems of partial differential
   equations (PDEs) that are discretized by the discontinuous Galerkin (dG)
   method. An efficient and accurate computation of these derivatives is
   important, for instance, in inverse problems and optimal control
   problems. This computation is usually based on an adjoint PDE system,
   and the question addressed in this paper is how the discretization of
   this adjoint system should relate to the dG discretization of the
   hyperbolic state equation. Adjoint-based derivatives can either be
   computed before or after discretization; these two options are often
   referred to as the optimize-then-discretize and discretize-then-optimize
   approaches. We discuss the relation between these two options for dG
   discretizations in space and Runge-Kutta time integration. The influence
   of different dG formulations and of numerical quadrature is discussed.
   Discretely exact discretizations for several hyperbolic optimization
   problems are derived, including the advection equation, Maxwell's
   equations and the coupled elastic-acoustic wave equation. We find that
   the discrete adjoint equation inherits a natural dG discretization from
   the discretization of the state equation and that the expressions for
   the discretely exact gradient often have to take into account
   contributions from element faces. For the coupled elastic-acoustic wave
   equation, the correctness and accuracy of our derivative expressions are
   illustrated by comparisons with finite difference gradients. The results
   show that a straightforward discretization of the continuous gradient
   differs from the discretely exact gradient, and thus is not consistent
   with the discretized objective. This inconsistency may cause
   difficulties in the convergence of gradient based algorithms for solving
   optimization problems.}},

Title = {{An Integrated Control and Design Framework for Optimizing Energy Capture

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Small wind turbines are a promising technology that can provide
   renewable power to rural and remote communities. In order to increase
   the efficiency and competitiveness of small wind technology, it is
   necessary to maximize the wind energy capture and to prolong the turbine
   system life. Accordingly, this paper presents an integrated development
   framework that optimizes component design goals, including durability
   and minimal gearbox mass, with the control objective of producing
   maximum energy over the turbine system's 20-yr life. This study focuses
   on the wind turbine gearbox, which plays a critical role in achieving
   high efficiency and extended system life. A variable ratio gearbox (VRG)
   previously developed by the authors is used as an example to demonstrate
   the methodology. In this paper, an algorithm developed for optimizing
   the VRG gear ratio is integrated with the design selection of
   commercially available gears, which will be used to construct the VRG
   gearbox. The proposed multi-objective framework is capable of
   identifying the optimal gearsets based on a trade-off between selecting
   gearsets that maximize wind turbine efficiency and choosing gearsets
   that best meet the design requirements.}},

Title = {{A framework for exploring unifying theories of empirical software
   engineering}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{99-123}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{One of the reasons for the lack of rigor in software engineering
   compared to physical and behavioral sciences is that the theories that
   underpin our work, both as software engineers and as software
   engineering researchers, have not been given enough attention. To
   provide a step forward towards greater rigor, a framework has been
   created with which to explore theories of software engineering and
   software engineering research. This framework provides a simple theory
   modeling language and model calculus to explore informally described
   theories and to generate the results of composing modeled theories. To
   illustrate and evaluate this framework, a general theory about software
   engineering is presented and then two simple theories, D and E, are
   proposed as the basis for laying out a unified theoretical foundation
   for software engineering and software engineering research. Software
   Engineering consists of two logical parts: design, and empirical
   evaluation (both terms used in their broadest senses). Theory D is the
   theoretical basis for the design part, and theory E is the theoretical
   basis for empirical evaluation. These two theories are then composed in
   various ways to lay out a space (a taxonomy, or ontology if you will)
   for software engineering and software engineering research. Finally, it
   is claimed that software engineering and software engineering research
   (both fully integrated with empirical evaluations) are models (in the
   logical sense) for these atomic and composed theories. To further
   evaluate the framework, examples are provided of modeling (implicit)
   theories found in a number of software engineering (theory) papers.
   The results of this research are: 1) a scientific elegance in creating
   larger more complex theories out of simpler theories, 2) an elegant way
   of explaining the complexity of software engineering and software
   engineering research, and 3) a theory modeling language and model
   calculus for composing the resulting theoretical models. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This letter presents a novel stochastic geometry approach to the

   The derived analytical results shed light on how the connectivity of
   mmWave networks depends on key system parameters such as the density and
   size of obstacles as well as relaying route window-the range of
   distances in which routing relays are selected. We find that multi-hop
   relaying can greatly improve the connectivity versus single hop mmWave
   transmission. We show that to obtain near-optimal connectivity the
   relaying route window should be about the size of the obstacles.}},

Title = {{Effect of ambient carbon dioxide on salt permeability and sorption
   measurements in ion-exchange membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{479}},
Pages = {{55-66}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing ion sorption and transport properties in charged polymers
   is critical for developing Fundamental understanding necessary to
   prepare high performance membranes. The presence of dissolved CO2 from
   the atmosphere in aqueous solutions can interfere with measurements of
   salt permeability and sorption in ion-exchange membranes, frustrating
   characterization of ion transport properties. In water or aqueous saline
   solutions, CO2 speciates to form ions such as H+ and HCO3-. NaCl or
   other salt permeability experiments are often performed by exposing a
   membrane to two salt solutions of different concentrations in a
   conventional diffusion cell and monitoring the conductivity use with
   time in the receiving chamber (i.e., the chamber containing the lower
   salt concentration). H+ and HCO3- ions in the external solutions on
   either side of the membrane undergo ion exchange with counter-ions in
   cation-and anion-exchange membranes, respectively. This CO2-induced ion
   exchange interferes with conductivity measurements designed to measure
   receiver salt concentration change with time due to ion permeation
   through the polymer from the higher salt concentration chamber (i.e.,
   the donor chamber). This phenomenon results in non-linear changes in
   downstream conductivity with time, which is most pronounced at low donor
   cell NaCl concentrations, especially for anion-exchange membranes.
   Furthermore, this effect is absent when an anion-exchange membrane in
   the HCO3- form is tested using NaHCO3 rather than NaCl for permeability
   measurements. The effect of CO2 on NaCl permeability measurements can be
   significantly reduced when ultra-high purity N-2 gas is bubbled through
   the donor and receiver solutions in the diffusion cell during the
   experiment, making it possible to obtain true NaCl permeability values.
   During NaCl sorption experiments, when an ion-exchange membrane was
   equilibrated with a NaCl solution of 0.1 M or lower, the amount of
   desorbed mobile counter-ions was significantly greater than the amount
   of desorbed mobile co-ions. The desorption of unequal amounts of ions
   can also be attributed to ion exchange between the membrane and solution
   phase and has implications for determining the mobile NaCI sorption
   coefficient. Procedures for addressing these issues are described. (C)

Abstract = {{Microfiltration membranes of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLEA) have been
   prepared by a nonsolvent-induced phase separation method with the aid of
   surfactants. Surfactants with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)
   values of 14.9-15.6 were found to be useful in reducing the shrinkage in
   thickness of the PLEA membrane. Among the surfactants examined, Tween 80
   was the best for preparing microfiltration membranes. The surfactant
   allowed instantaneous phase separation and seemed to enhance the
   diffusion of water in the PLEA solution during structure formation. The
   membrane had asymmetric finger-like structures and showed low membrane
   resistance and high bacterial cell retention when the membrane was
   prepared from a 10 wt\% PLEA solution in 1,4-dioxane containing 10 wt.\%
   Tween 80. Bovine serum albumin molecules passed through the membrane
   suggesting that the membrane functions as a microfiltration membrane.
   The membrane was stable at 25 degrees C but degradable at 60 degrees C
   in wet conditions. The membrane can be applied as a compostable
   microfiltration membrane in food and biochemical industries. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We present here a membraneless alkaline direct formate fuel cell (DFFC)
   with a catalyst-selective strategy, in which a non-hazardous,

   novel catalyst-selective strategy not only avoids the use of practically
   unviable alkaline anion-exchange membranes, but also overcomes the
   scalability limitation of the traditional membraneless DLFCs that are
   based on a micro-flow phenomenon, and allows the development of
   large-scale membraneless DLFCs with flexible configurations. In
   comparison to methanol, ethanol, and formic acid fuels, the aqueous
   formate solutions show superior oxidation kinetics and efficiency. The
   high power density exhibited by the membraneless alkaline DFFC is
   promising for developing small, safe, inexpensive portable power systems

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Collagen I hydrogels are commonly used to mimic the extracellular matrix
   (ECM) for tissue engineering applications. However, the ability to
   design collagen I hydrogels similar to the properties of physiological
   tissues has been elusive. This is primarily due to the lack of
   quantitative correlations between multiple fabrication parameters and
   resulting material properties. This study aims to enable informed design
   and fabrication of collagen hydrogels in order to reliably and
   reproducibly mimic a variety of soft tissues. We developed empirical
   predictive models relating fabrication parameters with material and
   transport properties. These models were obtained through extensive
   experimental characterization of these properties, which include
   compression modulus, pore and fiber diameter, and diffusivity.
   Fabrication parameters were varied within biologically relevant ranges
   and included collagen concentration, polymerization pH, and
   polymerization temperature. The data obtained from this study elucidates
   previously unknown fabrication-property relationships, while the
   resulting equations facilitate informed a priori design of collagen
   hydrogels with prescribed properties. By enabling hydrogel fabrication
   by design, this study has the potential to greatly enhance the utility
   and relevance of collagen hydrogels in order to develop physiological
   tissue microenvironments for a wide range of tissue engineering
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Using spin-polarized density functional calculations, we investigate the
   role of different Pd/Pt ensembles in determining CO chemisorption on
   Au-based bimetallic alloys through a study of the energetics, charge
   transfer, geometric and electronic structures of CO on various Pd/Pt
   ensembles (monomer/dimer/trimer/tetramer). We find that the effect of Pd
   ensembles on the reduction of CO chemisorption energy is much larger
   than the Pt ensemble case. In particular, small-sized Pd ensembles like
   monomer show a substantial reduction of CO chemisorption energy compared
   to the pure Pd (1 1 1) surface, while there are no significant size and
   shape effects of Pt ensembles on CO chemisorption energy. This is
   related to two factors: (1) the steeper potential energy surface (PES)
   of CO in Pd (1 1 1) than in Pt (1 1 1), indicating that the effect of
   switch of binding site preference on CO chemisorption energy is much
   larger in Pd ensembles than in Pt ensembles, and (2) down-shift of
   d-band in Pd ensembles/up-shift of d-band in Pt ensembles as compared to
   the corresponding pure Pd (1 1 1)/Pt (1 1 1) surfaces, suggesting more
   reduced activity of Pd ensembles toward CO adsorption than the Pt
   ensemble case. We also present the different bonding mechanism of CO on
   Pd/Pt ensembles by the analysis of orbital resolved density of state.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations and a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation
   based approach are used to illuminate how position-dependent solvent
   mobility near one or more tracer particle(s) is affected when
   tracer-solvent interactions are rationally modified to affect
   corresponding solvation structure. For tracers in a dense hard-sphere
   fluid, we compare two types of tracer-solvent interactions: (1) a
   hard-sphere-like interaction, and (2) a soft repulsion extending beyond
   the hard core designed via statistical mechanical theory to enhance
   tracer mobility at infinite dilution by suppressing coordination-shell
   structure {[}Carmer et al., Soft Matter 8, 4083-4089 (2012)]. For the
   latter case, we show that the mobility of surrounding solvent particles
   is also increased by addition of the soft repulsive interaction, which
   helps to rationalize the mechanism underlying the tracer's enhanced
   diffusivity. However, if multiple tracer surfaces are in closer
   proximity (as at higher tracer concentrations), similar interactions
   that disrupt local solvation structure instead suppress the
   position-dependent solvent dynamics. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   2D mantle cloaks with an assigned surface reactance, enabling, thus, the
   extension of the mantle cloaking technique to optical frequencies. Then,
   we design realistic optical mantle cloaks made of 2D arrays of
   spheroidal plasmonic nanoparticles with a high eccentricity. We show
   that the proposed cloaks allow significant, moderately broadband

Title = {{Eigen-disfigurement model for simulating plausible facial disfigurement
   after reconstructive surgery}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients with facial cancers can experience disfigurement as
   they may undergo considerable appearance changes from their illness and
   its treatment. Individuals with difficulties adjusting to facial cancer
   are concerned about how others perceive and evaluate their appearance.
   Therefore, it is important to understand how humans perceive disfigured
   faces. We describe a new strategy that allows simulation of surgically
   plausible facial disfigurement on a novel face for elucidating the human
   perception on facial disfigurement.
   Method: Longitudinal 3D facial images of patients (N = 17) with facial
   disfigurement due to cancer treatment were replicated using a facial
   mannequin model, by applying Thin-Plate Spline (TPS) warping and linear
   interpolation on the facial mannequin model in polar coordinates.
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to capture longitudinal
   structural and textural variations found within each patient with facial
   disfigurement arising from the treatment. We treated such variations as
   disfigurement. Each disfigurement was smoothly stitched on a healthy
   face by seeking a Poisson solution to guided interpolation using the
   gradient of the learned disfigurement as the guidance field vector. The
   modeling technique was quantitatively evaluated. In addition, panel
   ratings of experienced medical professionals on the plausibility of
   simulation were used to evaluate the proposed disfigurement model.
   Results: The algorithm reproduced the given face effectively using a
   facial mannequin model with less than 4.4mm maximum error for the
   validation fiducial points that were not used for the processing. Panel
   ratings of experienced medical professionals on the plausibility of
   simulation showed that the disfigurement model (especially for
   peripheral disfigurement) yielded predictions comparable to the real
   disfigurements.
   Conclusions: The modeling technique of this study is able to capture
   facial disfigurements and its simulation represents plausible outcomes
   of reconstructive surgery for facial cancers. Thus, our technique can be
   used to study human perception on facial disfigurement.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide (GO) aerogels, high porosity (>99\%) low density (similar
   to 3-10 mg cm(-3)) porous materials with GO pore walls, are particularly
   attractive due to their lightweight, high surface area, and potential
   use in environmental remediation, superhydrophobic and superoleophilic
   materials, energy storage, etc. However, pure GO aerogels are generally
   weak and delicate which complicates their handling and potentially
   limits their commercial implementation. The focus of this work Vas to
   synthesize highly elastic, mechanically stable aerogels that are robust
   and easy to handle without substantially sacrificing their high porosity
   or low density. To overcome this challenge, a small amount of readily
   available and, thermally cross-linkable poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was
   intermixed with GO to enhance the mechanical integrity Of the aerogel
   without disrupting other desirable characteristic properties. This
   method is a simple straightforward procedure that does not include
   multistep or complicated chemical reactions, and it produces aerogels
   with mass densities of about 4-6 mg cm(-3) and >99.6\% porosity-that can
   reversibly support up to 10 000 times their weight with full recovery of
   their original volume. Finally; pressure sensing capabilities were
   demonstrated and their oil absorption capacities were measured to be
   around 120 g oil per g aerogel(-1) which highlights their potential Use
   in practical applications.}},

Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Development of advanced energy-storage systems for portable devices,
   electric vehicles, and grid storage must fulfill several requirements:
   low-cost, long life, acceptable safety, high energy, high power, and
   environmental benignity. With these requirements, lithium-sulfur (Li-S)
   batteries promise great potential to be the next-generation high-energy
   system. However, the practicality of Li-S technology is hindered by
   technical obstacles, such as short shelf and cycle life and low sulfur
   content/loading, arising from the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates
   between the cathode and anode and the poor electronic conductivity of S
   and the discharge product Li2S. Much progress has been made during the
   past five years to circumvent these problems by employing sulfur-carbon
   or sulfur-polymer composite cathodes, novel cell configurations, and
   lithium-metal anode stabilization. This Progress Report highlights
   recent developments with special attention toward innovation in
   sulfur-encapsulation techniques, development of novel materials, and
   cell-component design. The scientific understanding and engineering
   concerns are discussed at the end in every developmental stage. The
   critical research directions needed and the remaining challenges to be
   addressed are summarized in the Conclusion.}},

   sensing purpose. With proper engineering of the passband, multiple high
   sensitivity PC microcavity sensors can be integrated into microarrays
   and be interrogated simultaneously between a single input and a single
   output port. The concept was demonstrated with a 2-channel L55 PC
   biosensor array containing PC waveguide filters. The experiment showed
   that the sensors on both channels can be monitored simultaneously from a
   single output spectrum. Less than 3 dB extra loss for the additional PC

Abstract = {{The synthesis of 3-dimensional silver metal structures for use in solid
   oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) as current collectors and cathodes for the
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORB.) by screen printing and sintering of
   Ag2O particles is presented. The microstructure of the silver thus
   obtained was found to depend on the processing temperature, with lower
   sintering temperatures resulting in greater porosity and surface area.
   The silver current collectors was found to undergo steam embrittlement
   during SOFC operation, but the embrittlement could be prevented by
   pre-treating the silver metal with N-2 gas at high temperatures (800
   degrees C) or with 10\% H-2-90\% Ar at room temperatures (similar to 25
   degrees C). An investigation of the polarization resistances of these
   silver samples by employing them as cathodes for ORB. on symmetric cells
   indicate that the samples with greater porosity show diminished
   performance, confirming that the rate limiting step for the silver
   cathodes is oxygen transport. These silver cathodes were also compared
   to similarly-prepared platinum cathodes, and the silver cathodes were
   observed to have drastically reduced polarization resistances. Copyright

Title = {{Gas permeation in thin films of ``high free-volume{''} glassy
   perfluoropolymers: Part II. CO2 plasticization and sorption}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) plasticization and sorption effects in both thick
   and thin films of ``high free-volume{''} glassy perfluoropolymers were
   studied by monitoring CO2 permeability and by observing changes in the
   film thickness and refractive index with ellipsometry measurements. The
   film thickness, aging time, thermal history and CO2 exposure protocols
   have significant effect on the absolute CO2 permeability and
   plasticization behavior of both thick and thin films. The extent of CO2
   plasticization increases as film thickness decreases and as the aging
   time is increased. The as-cast films showed higher plasticization
   compared to films which were annealed above T-g; however, the CO2
   permeability of both the ascast and annealed films continuously
   decreased during the depressurization step unlike other glassy polymers.
   In general, the various CO2 exposure protocols revealed lower CO2
   plasticization for perfluoropolymers compared to other reported glassy
   polymers. The extent of CO2 sorption obtained from the ellipsometry
   measurements was found to decrease with the decrease in the excess
   volume and increase in the aging time for perfluoropolymers; in
   addition, the structural differences among the various glassy polymers
   resulting in different polymer-gas interactions also affects the overall
   sorption characteristics. The lower plasticization in perfluoropolymers
   compared to Matrimid was also confirmed from the smaller percent
   increase observed for the experimental diffusion coefficient compared to
   the theoretically predicted diffusion coefficient from the dual
   sorption-mobility model. The Langmuir sorption parameter, C-H', and
   solubility at infinite dilution, So, obtained from fitting dual
   sorption-mobility model to sorption data, showed an excellent linear
   correlation with (T-g-35) degrees C. The CO2 diffusivity and
   permeability data obtained for thin films of various glassy polymers
   also showed a strong correlation with free volume. The somewhat unusual
   behavior of thin films of AF 2400 in comparison to other glassy polymers
   studied to date is believed to be related to the low cohesive energy
   density expected of perfluorinated structures and its high free volume
   resulting from the bulky dioxole comonomer. (C) 2014 Published by

Title = {{Polyethylene-based nanocomposites containing organoclay: A new approach
   to enhance gas barrier via multilayer coextrusion and interdiffusion}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{42-54}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Layer multiplying coextrusion was employed to produce films consisting
   of alternating layers of unfilled and particulate filled polymers, i.e.,
   low density polyethylene (LDPE) and maleic anhydride grafted linear low
   density polyethylene (LLDPE-g-MA)/organoclay nanocomposites. Layer
   multiplying coextrusion was employed to produce gas barrier films
   consisting of alternating layers of unfilled and particulate filled
   polymers, i.e., low density polyethylene (LDPE) and maleic anhydride
   grafted linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE-g-MA)/organoclay
   nanocomposite. To further enhance gas barrier performance, the clay
   concentration within the nanocomposite layers was increased several fold
   through annealing of the multilayer film in the melt state. Residing in
   the melt state activated the interdiffusion between the polymers and due
   to a significant difference in the molecular mobility between the LDPE
   and LLDPE-g-MA chains led to a moving boundary effect which contracted
   the (LLDPE-g-MA)-rich nanocomposite layers and expanded the LDPE-rich
   layers. Analysis of the clay morphology within the nanocomposite layers
   demonstrated an increase in the clay particle lengths and aspect ratios,
   which was attributed to the growth of ``skewed{''} aggregates during
   layer contraction and particle concentration. The melt induced clay
   concentration and increased clay particle dimensions caused. a
   significant decrease in oxygen permeability of the nanocomposite layers
   and reduced the overall permeability of the multilayered films.
   Morphology and transport behavior of the multilayered films were
   compared to a series of LLDPE-g-MA/clay bulk nanocomposites with varying
   clay content prepared by melt compounding in a twin screw extruder.
   Nielsen and Cussler models were used to describe the gas barrier data of
   the nanocomposite films. Although both models can be fit well to the
   experimental data, the Cussler model showed a better agreement with the
   morphological observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic nanostructures can manipulate light-matter interactions to
   induce absorption, scattering, and local heating through their localized
   surface plasmon resonances. Recently, plasmonic behavior of
   semiconductor nanocrystals has been investigated to stretch the
   boundaries of plasmonics farther into the infrared spectral range and to
   introduce unprecedented tunability. However, many fundamental questions
   remain regarding characteristics of plasmons in doped semiconductor
   nanocrystals. Field enhancement, especially near features with high
   curvature, is essential in many applications of plasmonic metal
   nanostructures, yet the potential for plasmonic field enhancement by
   semiconductor nanocrystals remains unknown. Here, we use the discrete
   dipole approximation (DDA) to understand the dependence of field
   enhancement on size, shape, and doping level of plasmonic semiconductor
   nanocrystals. Indium-doped cadmium oxide is considered as a prototypical
   material for which faceted cube-octohedral nanocrystals have been
   experimentally realized; their optical spectra are compared to our
   computational results. The computed extinction spectra are sensitive to
   changes in doping level, dielectric environment, and shape and size of
   the nanocrystals, providing insight for materials design.
   High-scattering efficiencies and efficient local heat production make
   100 nm particles suitable for photothermal therapies and simultaneous
   bioimaging. Meanwhile, single particles and dimers of nanocrystals
   demonstrate strong, shape- and wavelength-dependent near-field
   enhancement, highlighting their potential for applications in infrared
   sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, and solar conversion.}},

Abstract = {{Microgels are colloidally stable, hydrogel microparticles that have
   previously been used in a range of (soft) material applications due to
   their tunable mechanical and chemical properties. Most commonly, thermo
   and pH-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) microgels can be
   fabricated by precipitation polymerization in the presence of the
   co-monomer acrylic acid (AAc). Traditionally pNIPAm microgels are
   synthesized in the presence of a crosslinking agent, such as
   N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), however, microgels can also be
   synthesized under `crosslinker free' conditions. The resulting particles
   have extremely low (<0.5\%), core-localized crosslinking resulting from
   rare chain transfer reactions. AFM nanoindentation of these ultralow
   crosslinked (ULC) particles indicate that they are soft relative to
   crosslinked microgels, with a Young's modulus of similar to 10 kPa.
   Furthermore, ULC microgels are highly deformable as indicated by a high
   degree of spreading on glass surfaces and the ability to translocate
   through nanopores significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter
   of the particles. The size and charge of ULCs can be easily modulated by
   altering reaction conditions, such as temperature, monomer, surfactant
   and initiator concentrations, and through the addition of co-monomers.
   Microgels based on the widely utilized, biocompatible polymer
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) can also be synthesized under crosslinker free
   conditions. Due to their softness and deformability, ULC microgels are a
   unique base material for a wide variety of biomedical applications
   including biomaterials for drug delivery and regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Known experimental artificial magnetic conductors for terahertz and
   optical frequencies are formed by arrays of nanoparticles of various
   shapes. In this paper, we show that artificial magnetic conductors for
   the visible spectrum can be realized as simple, effectively quasistatic
   resonating structures, where the effective inductance is due to the
   magnetic flux inside a uniform metal substrate, and the effective
   capacitance is due to electric polarization of a thin uniform dielectric
   cover. To illustrate the main potential application of artificial
   magnetic conductors, we concentrate on the perfect-absorption regime,
   achieved by adjusting the loss factor of the artificial magnetic
   conductor to match its real input impedance to free space. We provide
   approximate analytical design formulas and introduce a simple equivalent
   circuit to explain the physical mechanism of emulation of magnetic
   response and perfect absorption of light. A prototype of a nearly
   perfect absorber for optical (from green to ultraviolet) frequencies is
   designed and experimentally tested. The results confirm the theoretical
   predictions and show polarization insensitivity and angular independence
   of response in a wide range of incidence angles.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{Few-layer black phosphorus (BP), also known as phosphorene, is poised to
   be the most attractive graphene analogue owing to its high mobility
   approaching that of graphene, and its thickness-tunable band gap that
   can be as large as that of molybdenum disulfide. In essence, phosphorene
   represents the much sought after high-mobility, large direct band gap
   two-dimensional layered crystal that is ideal for optoelectronics and
   flexible devices. However, its instability in air is of paramount
   concern for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate air-stable BP
   devices with dielectric and hydrophobic encapsulation. Microscopy,
   spectroscopy, and transport techniques were employed to elucidate the
   aging mechanism, which can initiate from the BP surface for bare
   samples, or edges for samples with thin dielectric coating, highlighting
   the ineffectiveness of conventional scaled dielectrics. Our months-long
   studies indicate that a double layer capping of Al2O3 and hydrophobic
   fluoropolymer affords BP devices and transistors with indefinite
   air-stability for the first time, overcoming a critical material
   challenge for applied research and development.}},

Abstract = {{A new theory and an exact computer algorithm for calculating kinetics
   and thermodynamic properties of a particle system are described. The
   algorithm avoids trapping in metastable states, which are typical
   challenges for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on rough energy
   landscapes. It is based on the division of the full space into Voronoi
   cells. Prior knowledge or coarse sampling of space points provides the
   centers of the Voronoi cells. Short time trajectories are computed
   between the boundaries of the cells that we call milestones and are used
   to determine fluxes at the milestones. The flux function, an essential
   component of the new theory, provides a complete description of the
   statistical mechanics of the system at the resolution of the milestones.
   We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the exact Milestoning
   approach by comparing numerical results obtained on a model system using
   exact Milestoning with the results of long trajectories and with a
   solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. The theory uses an
   equation that resembles the approximate Milestoning method that was
   introduced in 2004 {[}A. K. Faradjian and R. Elber, J. Chem. Phys.
   120(23), 10880-10889 (2004)]. However, the current formulation is exact
   and is still significantly more efficient than straightforward MD
   simulations on the system studied. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the parity-time symmetry concept, we show that a judicious
   spatial modulation of gain and loss in epsilon-near-zero metamaterials
   can induce the propagation of exponentially bound interface modes
   characterized by zero attenuation. With specific reference to a bilayer
   configuration, via analytical studies and parametrization of the
   dispersion equation, we show that this waveguiding mechanism can be
   sustained in the presence of moderate gain/loss levels, and it becomes
   leaky (i.e., radiative) below a gain/loss threshold. Moreover, we
   explore a possible rod-based metamaterial implementation, based on
   realistic material constituents, which captures the essential features
   of the waveguiding mechanism, in good agreement with our theoretical
   predictions. Our results may open up possibilities for the design of
   optical devices and reconfigurable nanophotonics platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Immunomagnetic assay combines the powers of the magnetic separation and
   biomarker recognition and has been an effective tool to perform rare
   Circulating Tumor Cells detection. Key factors associated with
   immunomagnetic assay include the capture rate, which indicates the
   sensitivity of the system, and distributions of target cells after
   capture, which impact the cell integrity and other biological properties
   that are critical to downstream analyses. Here we present a theoretical
   framework and technical approach to implement a microscale magnetic
   immunoassay through modulating local magnetic field towards enhanced
   capture and distribution of rare cancer cells. Through the design of a
   two-dimensional micromagnet array, we characterize the magnetic field
   generation and quantify the impact of the micromagnets on rare cell
   separation. Good agreement is achieved between the theory and
   experiments using a human colon cancer cell line (COLO205) as the

Abstract = {{Understanding and controlling fluids flow at the microscale is a matter
   of growing scientific and technological interest. Flow enhancements of
   water-based nanoparticle dispersions through microscale porous media are
   investigated through twelve hydrophilic sedimentary rocks with
   pore-throat radius between 1.2 and 10 mm, which are quantitatively
   explained with a simple model with slip length correction for Darcy
   flow. Both as wetting phase, water exhibited no-slip Darcy flow in all
   cores; however, flow enhancement of nanoparticle dispersions can be up
   to 5.7 times larger than that of water, and it increases with the
   decreasing of pore-throat radius. The experimental data reveals
   characteristic slip lengths are of order 500 and 1000 nm for 3M (R) and
   HNPs-1 nanoparticles, respectively, independent of the lithology or
   nanoparticle concentration or shear rate. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of
   flow degradation is observed for HNPs-2 nanoparticles. These results
   explore the feasible application of using nanoparticle dispersions to

Abstract = {{Assessment of molecular signatures of tumors in addition to their
   anatomy and morphology is desired for effective diagnostic and
   therapeutic procedures. Development of in vivo imaging techniques that
   can identify and monitor molecular composition of tumors remains an
   important challenge in pre-clinical research and medical practice. Here
   we present a molecular photoacoustic imaging technique that can
   visualize the presence and activity of an important cancer biomarker -
   epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), utilizing the effect of plasmon
   resonance coupling between molecular targeted gold nanoparticles.
   Specifically, spectral analysis of photoacoustic images revealed
   profound changes in the optical absorption of systemically delivered
   EGFR-targeted gold nanospheres due to their molecular interactions with
   tumor cells overexpressing EGFR. In contrast, no changes in optical
   properties and, therefore, photoacoustic signal, were observed after
   systemic delivery of non-targeted gold nanoparticles to the tumors. The
   results indicate that multi-wavelength photoacoustic imaging augmented
   with molecularly targeted gold nanoparticles has the ability to monitor
   molecular specific interactions between nanoparticles and cell-surface
   receptors, allowing visualization of the presence and functional
   activity of tumor cells. Furthermore, the approach can be used for other
   cancer cell-surface receptors such as human epidermal growth factor
   receptor 2 (HER2). Therefore, ultrasound-guided molecular photoacoustic
   imaging can potentially aid in tumor diagnosis, selection of customized
   patient-specific treatment, and monitor the therapeutic progression and
   outcome in vivo. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH. This

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{442-451}},

Abstract = {{A smooth angular velocity observer is proposed for the attitude tracking
   control of a rigid body in the absence of angular velocity measurements.
   The observer design ensures asymptotic convergence of angular velocity
   state estimation errors irrespective of the control torque or the
   initial attitude state of the spacecraft. Unlike existing rate observer
   formulations that attain estimation error convergence by imposing
   certain switching conditions or hybrid logic, the proposed observer has
   a smooth structure that ensures C-infinity continuity of all estimated
   states. Furthermore, the combined implementation of the proposed
   observer with a proportional-derivative type of attitude control law
   leads to an important ``separation property.{''} In particular, an
   independently designed proportional-derivative control law driven by
   angular velocity estimates generated from the smooth observer results in
   (almost) global asymptotic stability of the overall closed-loop tracking
   error dynamics. The main feature of this key technical result stems from
   our use of a Lyapunov ``strictification{''} process that enables the
   closed-loop stability and convergence analysis to proceed along novel
   lines in a spiral logic fashion. A rigorous analysis of the proposed
   formulation is provided and numerical simulation studies are presented
   to help illustrate the effectiveness of the angular velocity observer
   for rigid-body attitude tracking control.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{A novel decentralized cooperative control protocol is proposed for the
   convergence of an autonomous spacecraft swarm to a common circular orbit
   using finite thrust. Guidance and consensus algorithms are designed and
   implemented in a decentralized fashion to drive agents to an orbit of
   prescribed semimajor axis and zero eccentricity, with the plane of
   orbital motion determined through consensus. The thrust-limited guidance
   and consensus schemes are designed separately and then readily combined
   to obtain asymptotic stability of the overall closed-loop system. Both
   the guidance and consensus protocols are designed in the presence of
   input saturation to satisfy the maximum available thrust magnitude
   constraint. The guidance law employs a switching strategy, whereas the
   consensus algorithm uses a smooth saturation function for bounded
   control input. Through rigorous analysis, it is shown that the
   multi-agent system converges to a common orbit with the desired
   eccentricity and semimajor axis when the communication topology is given
   by a connected and undirected tree or ring graph. In addition, numerical
   simulation studies are presented for a spacecraft formation around
   Earth, as well as for a formation with planet Ceres as the primary body,

Abstract = {{Renewable solar energy harvesting systems have received considerable
   attention as a possible substitute for conventional chemical batteries
   in sensor networks. However, it is difficult to optimize the use of
   solar energy based only on empirical power acquisition patterns in
   sensor networks. We apply acquisition patterns from actual solar energy
   harvesting systems and build a framework to maximize the utilization of
   solar energy in general sensor networks. To achieve this goal, we
   develop a cross-layer optimization-based scheduling scheme called
   binding optimization of duty cycling and networking through energy
   tracking (BUCKET), which is formulated in four-stages: 1) prediction of
   energy harvesting and arriving traffic; 2) internode optimization at the
   transport and network layers; 3) intranode optimization at the medium
   access control layer; and 4) flow control of generated communication
   task sets using a token-bucket algorithm. Monitoring of the structural
   health of bridges is shown to be a potential application of an
   energy-harvesting sensor network. The example network deploys five
   sensor types: 1) temperature; 2) strain gauge; 3) accelerometer; 4)
   pressure; and 5) humidity. In the simulations, the BUCKET algorithm
   displays performance enhancements of similar to 12-15\% over those of
   conventional methods in terms of the average service rate.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for electric vehicles and large-scale smart grids
   has aroused great interest in developing high energy density storage
   devices. Lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery has attracted much attention
   owing to its high theoretical energy density and abundance, but many
   challenges such as rapid capacity fade and low sulfur loading and
   utilization have impeded its practical use. Here, we present a
   free-standing TiO2 nanowire/graphene hybrid membrane for Li/dissolved
   polysulfide batteries with high capacity and long cycling life. Graphene
   membrane with high electrical conductivity is used as a current
   collector to effectively reduce the internal resistance in the sulfur
   cathode and physically immobilize the dissolved lithium polysulfides.
   The TiO2 nanowires introduced into the graphene membrane offer a
   hierarchical composite structure, in which the TiO2 nanowires not only
   have strong chemical binding with the lithium polysulfides, but also
   show a strong catalytic effect for polysulfide reduction and oxidation,
   promoting a fast redox reaction kinetics with high capacity and low
   voltage polarization. This hybrid electrode delivers a high specific
   capacity of 1327 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C rate, a Coulombic efficiency
   approaching 100\%, high-rate performance of 850 mA h g(-1) at 2 C rate,
   and long cyclic stability with a capacity of 1053 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C
   rate over 200 cycles, demonstrating great prospect for application in
   high energy Li-S batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{Expensive Pt-based catalysts are usually required to achieve a high
   discharge voltage and long operation life for hybrid Li-air batteries.
   However, the cost of the catalysts needs to be lowered by either
   reducing the Pt loading in the catalysts or replacing Pt with less
   expensive catalysts. Here, we report the strong coupling of Co3O4
   nanocrystals with an O- and N-doped carbon nanoweb (ON-CNW) as a
   low-cost, highly-efficient catalyst for hybrid Li-air batteries with an
   alkaline catholyte. Co3O4/ ON-CNW greatly reduces the discharge
   overpotential compared to ON-CNW and exhibits longer cycle life, which
   is even better than that of the best reported N-doped mesoporous carbon
   (0.016\% decrease in efficiency per cycle for 130 cycles compared to
   0.017\% decrease per cycle for 100 cycles obtained with N-doped
   mesoporous carbon). Although Pt/C exhibits a slightly higher initial
   discharge voltage (3.02 V compared to 100 V for Co3O4/ON-CNW), the cycle
   life of Pt/C is < 50 cycles, making Co3O4/ON-CNW as a viable, stable
   cathode for hybrid Li-air batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All nghts

   synthesis, crystallographic, thermal and electrical conductivity
   properties of Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d) a complex
   perovskites were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld

   apply these oxide materials for the HT-SOFC anode materials.
   XRD results showed that Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d) oxide
   systems synthesized as single phases did not react with 8 mol\% yttria
   stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) and 10 mol\% Gd-doped cerium oxide (CGO91) up

   Sm0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3 +/- d (SSTM) showed orthorhombic symmetry with
   the space group Pbnm and SSTM showed a more distorted structure.
   Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) proved weight gains in these three

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{509-516}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Promising production trends and predictions, as well as improvements
   in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies, have made
   unconventional reservoirs economically feasible. Although these
   reservoirs have high initial production rates, it is observed that their
   production performance declines fast. Therefore, it is necessary to
   identify the reasons behind the production performance reduction. With
   continuing production, pore pressure decreases and consequently the
   effective stress applying on fractures increases. This phenomenon causes
   the fracture closure. In this paper, both individual and combined
   effects of natural fracture and hydraulic fracture closures on well
   performance are investigated. We use available experimental data to
   represent hydraulic and natural fracture conductivity alterations with
   changing stress conditions. Simulation results show that the individual
   effects of hydraulic and natural fracture closure on production
   performance is in the range of 6\%-13\% and 7\%-23\%, respectively.
   Additionally, the combined effect of natural and hydraulic fracture
   closure is in the range of 10\%-25\%. It is observed that the coupled
   effect of natural and hydraulic fracture conductivity losses is less
   than the summation of the individual effects. Sensitivity analysis is
   also performed for certain reservoir parameters. This work can provide a
   better understanding of the main reasons of production losses from
   unconventional reservoir simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1846-1859}},

Abstract = {{It is a challenge to upscale solute transport in porous media for
   multispecies bio-kinetic reactions because of incomplete mixing within
   the elementary volume and because biofilm growth can change porosity and
   affect pore-scale flow and diffusion. To address this challenge, we
   present a hybrid model that couples pore-scale subdomains to
   continuum-scale subdomains. While the pore-scale subdomains involving
   significant biofilm growth and reaction are simulated using pore-scale
   equations, the other subdomains are simulated using continuum-scale
   equations to save computational time. The pore-scale and continuum-scale
   subdomains are coupled using a mortar method to ensure continuity of
   solute concentration and flux at the interfaces. We present results for
   a simplified two-dimensional system, neglect advection, and use dual
   Monod kinetics for solute utilization and biofilm growth. The results
   based on the hybrid model are consistent with the results based on a
   pore-scale model for three test cases that cover a wide range of
   Damkohler (Da=reaction rate/diffusion rate) numbers for both homogeneous
   (spatially periodic) and heterogeneous pore structures. We compare
   results from the hybrid method with an upscaled continuum model and show
   that the latter is valid only for cases of small Damkohler numbers,
   consistent with other results reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid progress in integrated photonics has fostered numerous chip-scale
   sensing, computing and signal processing technologies. However, many
   crucial filtering and signal delay operations are difficult to perform
   with all-optical devices. Unlike photons propagating at luminal speeds,
   GHz-acoustic phonons moving at slower velocities allow information to be
   stored, filtered and delayed over comparatively smaller length-scales
   with remarkable fidelity. Hence, controllable and efficient coupling
   between coherent photons and phonons enables new signal processing
   technologies that greatly enhance the performance and potential impact
   of integrated photonics. Here we demonstrate a mechanism for coherent
   information processing based on travelling-wave photon-phonon
   transduction, which achieves a phonon emit-and-receive process between
   distinct nanophotonic waveguides. Using this device, physics-which
   supports GHz frequencies-we create wavelength-insensitive radiofrequency
   photonic filters with frequency selectivity, narrow-linewidth and high
   power-handling in silicon. More generally, this emit-receive concept is
   the impetus for enabling new signal processing schemes.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Accuracy of IVOCT for measurement of neointimal thickness and effect of
   neointima in the appearance of metallic struts in IVOCT images was
   investigated. Phantom vessels were constructed and coronary stents were
   deployed and covered with thick (250-400 mu m) and thin (30-70 mu m)
   phantom neointima. High resolution Micro-CT images of the stent struts
   were recorded as a gold standard. IVOCT images of the phantom vessels
   were acquired with various luminal blood scattering strengths and
   measured neointimal thicknesses from IVOCT and Micro-CT images were
   compared. In transparent lumen, comparison of IVOCT and Micro-CT
   neointima thickness measurements found no significant difference (p >
   0.05) in the thick neointima phantom but a significant difference (p <
   0.05) in the thin neointima phantom. For both thick and thin neointima,
   IVOCT neointimal thickness measurements varied from Micro-CT values by
   as much as +/- 35 \%. Increased luminal scattering due to presence of
   blood at concentrations < 5 \% did not interfere with measurement of
   thin neointimas and was validated by ANOVA analysis (p = 0.95). IV-OCT
   measurement of strut feature size with an overlying thin neointima match
   true values determined with Micro-CT (p = 0.82). Presence of a thick
   neointima resulted in lateral elongation or merry-go-rounding of stent
   strut features in IVOCT images. Phantom IVOCT images suggest that thick
   neointimal layers can result in more than 40 \% lateral elongation of
   stent strut features. Simulated IVOCT images of metallic stent struts
   with varying neointimal thickness suggest that neointimal light
   scattering can introduce the merry-go-round effect.}},

Title = {{Self-biased reconfigurable graphene stacks for terahertz plasmonics}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The gate-controllable complex conductivity of graphene offers
   unprecedented opportunities for reconfigurable plasmonics at terahertz
   and mid-infrared frequencies. However, the requirement of a gating
   electrode close to graphene and the single `control knob' that this
   approach offers limits the practical implementation and performance of
   these devices. Here we report on graphene stacks composed of two or more
   graphene monolayers separated by electrically thin dielectrics and
   present a simple and rigorous theoretical framework for their
   characterization. In a first implementation, two graphene layers gate
   each other, thereby behaving as a controllable single equivalent layer
   but without any additional gating structure. Second, we show that adding
   an additional gate allows independent control of the complex
   conductivity of each layer within the stack and provides enhanced
   control on the stack equivalent complex conductivity. These results are
   very promising for the development of THz and mid-infrared plasmonic
   devices with enhanced performance and reconfiguration capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Contrary to rectangular deep beams, inverted-T beams are loaded on a
   ledge at the bottom chord of the beam. This loading configuration
   induces a tension field into the web and the resulting complex strain
   distribution renders sectional design provisions inadequate. The
   applicability of strut-and-tie modeling (STM), developed for rectangular
   deep beams and simpler, two-dimensional designs, was evaluated. An
   experimental study was conducted in which 33 tests were performed on 22
   large-scale reinforced concrete inverted-T beams and the effects of the
   following variables were investigated: ledge geometry, quantity of web
   reinforcement, number of point loads, member depth, and shear span-depth
   ratio. It was concluded that strut-and-tie modeling, although developed
   for much simpler structural components, offers a simple and accurate
   design method for the more complex strain distributions in inverted-T
   beams. The STM provisions developed for rectangular beams accurately
   captured both failure mode and ultimate capacity and are recommended for
   use in inverted-T beam design, as a major conclusion of this research.}},

Title = {{An Alternate Pathway of Arsenate Resistance in E. coli Mediated by the
   Glutathione S-Transferase GstB}},
Journal = {{ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{875-882}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Microbial arsenate resistance is known to be conferred by specialized
   oxidoreductase enzymes termed arsenate reductases. We carried out a
   genetic selection on media supplemented with sodium arsenate for
   multicopy genes that can confer growth to E. coli mutant cells lacking
   the gene for arsenate reductase (E. coli Delta arsC). We found that
   overexpression of glutathione S-transferase B (GstB) complemented the
   Delta arsC allele and conferred growth on media containing up to 5 mM
   sodium arsenate. Interestingly, unlike wild type E. coli arsenate
   reductase, arsenate resistance via GstB was not dependent on reducing
   equivalents provided by glutaredoxins or a catalytic cysteine residue.
   Instead, two arginine residues, which presumably coordinate the arsenate
   substrate within the electrophilic binding site of GstB, were found to
   be critical for transferase activity. We provide biochemical evidence
   that GstB acts to directly reduce arsenate to arsenite with reduced
   glutathione (GSH) as the electron donor. Our results reveal a pathway
   for the detoxification of arsenate in bacteria that hinges on a
   previously undescribed function of a bacterial glutathione
   S-transferase.}},

Abstract = {{While several functional platforms for cell culturing have been proposed

   aligners, whose system modulus is matched with target tissues. This
   multifunctional platform is capable of aligning plated cells and in situ
   monitoring of cellular physiological characteristics during
   proliferation and differentiation. In addition, it is successfully
   applied as an in vitro muscle-on-a-chip testing platform. Finally, a
   simple but high-yield transfer printing mechanism is proposed to deliver
   cell sheets for scaffold-free, localized cell therapy in vivo. The
   muscle-mimicking stiffness of the platform allows the high-yield
   transfer printing of multiple cell sheets and results in successful
   therapies in diseased animal models. Expansion of current results to

   severely distorted idealization of natural porous media. In contrast,
   percolation theory provides a reliable and powerful means to model
   interconnectivity of disordered networks and porous materials. In this
   study, we invoke scaling concepts from percolation theory and effective
   medium theory to predict the saturation dependence of modes of transport
   - hydraulic and electrical conductivity, air permeability, and gas
   diffusion - in two disturbed soils. Universal scaling from percolation
   theory predicts the saturation dependence of air permeability and gas
   diffusion accurately, even when the percolation threshold for airflow is
   estimated from the porosity. We also find that the non-universal scaling
   obtained from the critical path analysis (CPA) of percolation theory can
   make excellent predictions of hydraulic and electrical conductivity
   under partially saturated conditions.}},

Abstract = {{As minimum feature size and pitch spacing further scale down, triple
   patterning lithography is a likely 193 nm extension along the paradigm
   of double patterning lithography for 14-nm technology node. Layout
   decomposition, which divides input layout into several masks to minimize
   the conflict and stitch numbers, is a crucial design step for
   double/triple patterning lithography. In this paper, we present a
   systematic study on triple patterning layout decomposition problem,
   which is shown to be NP-hard. Because of the NP-hardness, the runtime
   required to exactly solve it increases dramatically with the problem
   size. We first propose a set of graph division techniques to reduce the
   problem size. Then, we develop integer linear programming (ILP) to solve
   it. For large layouts, even with the graph-division techniques, ILP may
   still suffer from serious runtime overhead. To achieve better trade-off
   between runtime and performance, we present a novel semidefinite
   programming (SDP)-based algorithm. Followed by a mapping process, we can
   translate the SDP solutions into the final decomposition solutions.
   Experimental results show that the graph division can reduce runtime
   dramatically. In addition, SDP-based algorithm can achieve great
   speed-up even compared with accelerated ILP, with very comparable
   results in terms of the stitch number and the conflict number.}},

Title = {{Cavitation in rubber: an elastic instability or a fracture phenomenon?}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FRACTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{192}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-23}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The viewpoint that cavitation in rubber-that is, the sudden growth of
   inherent defects in rubber into large enclosed cavities in response to
   external stimuli-is a purely elastic phenomenon has long been known to
   be fundamentally incomplete. Essentially, this is because the local
   stretches around the defects at which cavitation initiates far exceed
   the elastic limit of the rubber, which therefore ought to inelastically
   deform by fracturing to accommodate their growth. Yet, rather
   remarkably, the classical heuristic elastic criterion stating that
   cavitation occurs at material points wherein the hydrostatic component
   of the stress reaches the critical value , with denoting the initial
   shear modulus of the rubber, has been shown to agree reasonably well
   with a number of experimental observations. This agreement suggests that
   the elastic properties of rubber may play a significant-possibly even
   dominant-role on the occurrence of cavitation. The purpose of this paper
   is to provide insight into the relevance of the elastic properties of
   rubber on the phenomenon of cavitation. To this end, the comprehensive
   elastic cavitation theory recently put forward by Lopez-Pamies et al. (J
   Mech Phys Solids 59:1464-1487, 2011a) is directly confronted to two
   classical sets of experiments that to date have been understood only in
   part: (i) the poker-chip experiments of Gent and Lindley (Proc R Soc
   Lond A 249:195-205, 1959) and (ii) the experiments of Gent and Park (J
   Mater Sci 19:1947-1956, 1959) dealing with cavitation near reinforcing
   filler particles. Specifically, both sets of experiments are
   theoretically reproduced under the assumptions that the underlying
   rubber is Gaussian (for any arbitrarily large deformation) and that its
   inherent defects are vacuous and isotropically distributed. Results are
   presented for when and where cavitation occurs in the specimens as well
   as for the ensuing growth and interaction of the cavities once they have
   been ``nucleated{''}. It is found that the elastic theoretical results
   are in good agreement with many of the qualitative but few of the
   quantitative features of the experiments. The reasons behind this
   remarkable partial agreement and its practical implications are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{When a lander approaches the lunar surface, the plume from the descent
   engine impinges on the ground and entrains loose regolith into a
   high-velocity spray. This problem is simulated with a hybrid
   continuum-kinetic solver, where the internal nozzle flow and near-field
   plume are simulated with a continuum solver (data parallel line
   relaxation) and the regions of two-phase flow are simulated via the
   direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Fully coupled two-phase dust and
   gas motions and an inelastic grain-grain collision model have been
   implemented for a polydisperse distribution of particles sizes. This
   work examines the sensitivity of the solutions to these models for the
   case of steady axisymmetric plume impingement at different hovering
   altitudes. Of the physical phenomena modeled in this work, the dust
   sprays were found to be most sensitive to grain-grain collisions. The
   coefficient of restitution for colliding grains was parametrically
   studied and has a significant impact on how grain-grain collisions
   scatter the dust sprays.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The use of electrodynamic tethers for propulsion and power generation is
   attractive for missions to the outer planets, which are traditionally
   handicapped by large propellant requirements, large times of flight, and
   a scarcity of power available. In this work, the orbital dynamics of a
   spacecraft using electrodynamic tether propulsion during the mission
   phases of capture, apojove pump down and perijove pump up, in the Jovian
   system are investigated. The main result is the mapped design space
   involving mission duration, tether length, and minimum perijove radius.
   Phase-free flyby sequences are also included, which provide performance
   upper bounds for a given mission architecture. It is found to be
   advantageous to use inbound-only flybys of the Galilean moons during
   capture. Flybys during the apojove pump down phase are only useful in
   conjunction with a perijove-raising mechanism at apoapse such as solar
   perturbations or a small propulsive maneuver. The electrodynamic tether
   systemis also shown to be capable of lowering the spacecraft's orbit to
   a Europa-Ganymede Hohmann orbit with a total flight time of under a year
   and a half after entering Jupiter's sphere of influence, using
   reasonable assumptions for spacecraft mass and tether parameters.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1589-1595}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Density functional theory is used to determine the reaction mechanisms
   of CO oxidation and the active oxygen species on a Au/TiO2 model
   catalyst. The model consists of a Au rod supported along the TiO2 {[}1
   (1) over bar0] direction of the TiO2(110) surface. An interfacial
   Au/Ti5c site at the interface boundary is identified to be particularly
   active toward O-2 adsorption and dissociation. At this site, O-2
   dissociation has an energy barrier of 0.5 eV, which is facile at room
   temperature. The resulting adsorbed Au/O/Ti-5c oxygen species are shown
   to be stable and active for CO oxidation under relevant reaction
   conditions with an activation energy of 0.24 eV. Furthermore, the
   adsorbed Au/O/Ti5c oxygen species functions as an electron reservoir,
   and it lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy of a surface lattice
   oxygen (Obri), as well as the Ti interstitial formation energy, due to
   electron transfer from high-energy defect states to low-energy p-states
   of the adsorbed Au/O/Ti5c oxygen species. Hence, the Obri species is
   activated at the oxidized Au/TiO2 interface boundary and the energy
   barrier of CO oxidation with Obri is calculated to be 0.55 eV. Thus, the
   CO oxidation reaction can proceed at room temperature either via a
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with an adsorbed Au/O/Ti-5c oxygen
   species or via a Au-assisted Mars-van Krevelen mechanism with Obri.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{335-338}},

Abstract = {{Natural melanin is difficult to process due to its poor solubility and
   poorly understood structure. Synthetic melanin has been produced more
   recently, which is dispersible in mildly alkaline water and has many of
   the same properties of natural melanin. In this study, thin films of
   synthetic melanin and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) were deposited
   layer-by-layer from dilute aqueous solutions in ambient conditions. This
   is likely the first time melanin has been deposited from water to
   produce a functional nanocoating. These films display broadband UV light
   absorption, absorbing over 63\% of incident light that is most damaging
   to human eyes with a thickness of 108 rim. In an effort to demonstrate
   the utility of these melanin-based nanocoatings, a 30 bilayer film is
   shown to increase the useful life of a conductive
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) film
   by 550\%. This novel method of depositing melanin should open the door

Abstract = {{The two major pathways for energy utilization from biomass are
   conversion to a liquid fuel (i.e., biofuels) or conversion to
   electricity (i.e., biopower). In the United States (US), biomass policy
   has focused on biofuels. However, this paper will investigate three
   options for biopower: low co-firing (co-firing scenarios refer to
   combusting a given percentage of biomass with coal) (5\%-10\% biomass),
   medium co-firing (15\%-20\% biomass), and dedicated biomass firing
   (100\% biomass). We analyze the economic and greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions impact of each of these options, with and without CO2 capture
   and storage (CCS). Our analysis shows that in the absence of land use
   change emissions, all biomass co-combustion scenarios result in a
   decrease in GHG emissions over coal generation alone. The two biggest
   barriers to biopower are concerns about carbon neutrality of biomass
   fuels and the high cost compared to today's electricity prices. This
   paper recommends two policy actions. First, the need to define
   sustainability criteria and initiate a certification process so that
   biomass providers have a fixed set of guidelines to determine whether
   their feedstocks qualify as renewable energy sources. Second, the need
   for a consistent, predictable policy that provides the economic
   incentives to make biopower economically attractive.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Abstract = {{Water heating represented nearly 13\% of 2010 residential energy
   consumption making it an important target for energy conservation
   efforts. The objective of this work is to identify spatially-resolved
   strategies for energy conservation, since little analysis has been done
   to identify how regional characteristics affect the energy consumed for
   water heating. We present a first-order thermodynamic analysis,
   utilizing ab initio calculations and regression methods, to quantify
   primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions with regional specificity
   by considering by considering local electricity mixes, heat rates, solar
   radiation profiles, heating degrees days, and water heating unit sales
   for 27 regions of the US. Results suggest that shifting from electric
   towards natural gas or solar water heating offered primary energy and
   CO2 emission reductions in most US regions, but these reductions varied
   considerably according to regional electricity mix and solar resources.
   We find that regions that would benefit most from technology
   transitions, are often least likely to switch due to limited economic
   incentives. Our results suggest that federal energy factor metrics,
   which ignore upstream losses in power generation, are insufficient in
   informing consumers about the energy performance of residential end use
   appliances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Our aim is to characterize the minimum index code length that the sender
   needs to transmit to simultaneously satisfy all user requests. We show
   that the optimal binary vector index code length is equal to the minimum
   rank (minrank) of a matrix whose elements consist of the sets of desired
   packet indices and side-information encoding matrices. This is the
   natural extension of matrix minrank in the presence of coded side
   information. Using the derived expression, we propose a greedy
   randomized algorithm to minimize the rank of the derived matrix.}},

Abstract = {{In several wireless sensor networks, it is of interest to determine the
   maximum of the sensor readings and identify the sensor responsible for
   it. We propose a novel, decentralized, scalable, energy-efficient,
   timer-based, one-shot max function computation (TMC) algorithm. In it,
   the sensor nodes do not transmit their readings in a centrally
   pre-defined sequence. Instead, the nodes are grouped into clusters, and
   computation occurs over two contention stages. First, the nodes in each
   cluster contend with each other using the timer scheme to transmit their
   reading to their cluster-heads. Thereafter, the cluster-heads use the
   timer scheme to transmit the highest sensor reading in their cluster to
   the fusion node. One new challenge is that the use of the timer scheme
   leads to collisions, which can make the algorithm fail. We optimize the
   algorithm to minimize the average time required to determine the maximum
   subject to a constraint on the probability that it fails to find the
   maximum. TMC significantly lowers average function computation time,
   average number of transmissions, and average energy consumption compared
   to approaches proposed in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we attempt to target Arginine auxotrophy in glioblastoma
   multiforme (GBM) cells using a pegylated recombinant human Arginase I
   cobalt {[}HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000]. We tested and characterized the activity
   of HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 on a panel of 9 GBM cell lines and on human fetal
   glial cells (SVG-p12). HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 was cytotoxic to all GBM
   cells tested. SVG-p12 cells were not sensitive demonstrating the
   selective cytotoxicity of HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000-induced arginine
   deprivation. Addition of L-citrulline led to the rescue of 6 GBM cell
   lines but only at concentrations of 11.4 mM, reflecting the extent of
   arginine auxotrophy in GBM. The ability of L-citrulline to rescue cells
   was dependent on the expression of argininosuccinate synthetase-1 (ASS1)
   with the cells that were not rescued by L-citrulline being negative for
   ASS1 expression. Knocking-down ASS1 reversed the ability of L-citrulline
   to rescue GBM cells, further illustrating the dependence of arginine
   auxotrophy on ASS1 expression. Inhibition of autophagy increased cell
   sensitivity to HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000 indicating that, following arginine
   deprivation, autophagy plays a protective role in GBM cells. Analysis of
   the type of cell death revealed a lack of AnnexinV staining and caspase
   activation in HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000-treated cells, indicating that
   arginine deprivation induces caspase-independent, non-apoptotic cell
   death in GBM. We have shown that GBM cells are auxotrophic for arginine
   and can be selectively targeted using HuArgI (Co)-PEG5000-induced
   arginine depletion, thus demonstrating that L-Arginine deprivation is a
   potent and selective potential treatment for GBM.}},

   we report the first flexible black phosphorus (BP) field-effect
   transistors (FETs) with electron and hole mobilities superior to what
   has been previously achieved with other more studied flexible layered
   semiconducting transistors such as MoS2 and WSe2. Encapsulated
   bottom-gated BP ambipolar FETs on flexible polyimide afforded maximum
   carrier mobility of about 310 cm(2)/V.s with field-effect current
   modulation exceeding 3 orders of magnitude. The device ambipolar
   functionality and high-mobility were employed to realize essential
   circuits of electronic systems for flexible technology including
   ambipolar digital inverter, frequency doubler, and analog amplifiers
   featuring voltage gain higher than other reported layered semiconductor
   flexible amplifiers. In addition, we demonstrate the first flexible BP
   amplitude-modulated (AM) demodulator, an active stage useful for radio
   receivers, based on a single ambipolar BP transistor, which results in
   audible signals when connected to a loudspeaker or earphone. Moreover,
   the BP transistors feature mechanical robustness up to 2\% uniaxial

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the pore saturation of CO2 injected into heterogeneous
   rocks for permanent storage is a key challenge for constraining storage
   efficiency (capacity), plume migration extent, and seismic imaging. Much
   work on fluid flow and saturation has focused on traditional
   pressure-gradient driven flow represented by viscous multi-phase Darcy
   flow. Here we investigate CO2 saturations resulting from buoyancy-driven
   capillary flow, where buoyancy forces dominate viscous forces. These low
   capillary number flow regimes (Ca < 10(-4)) exist some distance from
   injection wells, potentially representing the majority of the storage
   domain during and after injection. We simulate CO2-brine buoyant
   displacement patterns using invasion percolation (IP) methods in various
   decimeter-scale, highly resolved heterogeneous 20 models. Different
   sedimentologic fabrics result in dramatic variability of total CO2
   saturation. We seek a generalized predictive model that allows CO2
   saturation resulting from capillary flow to be estimated reasonably for
   2D domains from fundamental geologic and fluid properties. We focus on
   three metrics of pore threshold pressure in clastic porous materials:
   the central value (median; mean), the range (standard deviation), and
   the ratio of the horizontal to vertical correlation length. These are
   formalized in the description of 54 clastic facies and three fabrics. An
   `IP Saturation Predictor' model is derived by linear interpolation of
   simulation results from synthetic stochastic models representing a wide
   range of facies and fabrics. To validate model results, we compare the
   predictive model with flow simulations in model domains extracted from
   highly resolved natural geologic sedimentary samples at similar
   resolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Seismic performance of self-centering steel plate shear walls with

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{198-208}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the self-centering steel plate shear wall (SC-SPSW) system, thin
   steel web plates provide the primary lateral strength and energy
   dissipation, while post-tensioned connections in the boundary frame
   provide recentering and mitigate frame damage. In most steel plate shear
   walls (SPSWs), web plates are connected to the beams and columns;
   however, connecting the web plates to the beams only has been proposed
   as a means of reducing boundary frame demands and mitigating web plate
   damage. This paper investigates the impact of using beam-only-connected
   web plates on SC-SPSW design and seismic performance. Expressions for
   determining beam demands for purposes of design are developed. Three-
   and nine-story prototype SC-SPSWs are designed using beam-only-connected
   web plates and are compared with equivalent SC-SPSWs designs with
   fully-connected web plates. To evaluate the potential for material
   savings, the weight of steel required for each system is compared. The
   seismic performance of the SC-SPSWs with beam-only-connected and
   fully-connected web plates is compared using results of nonlinear
   response history analyses in which relatively simple, yet conservative,
   modeling techniques are employed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We take a novel approach to decision problems involving binary

   literature approaches such problems by forming an optimal portfolio of
   activities. However, often practitioners instead form a rank-ordered

   account for both viewpoints. We rank activities considering both the
   uncertainty in the problem parameters and the optimal portfolio that
   will be obtained once the uncertainty is revealed. We use stochastic
   integer programming as a modeling framework, and we apply our approach
   to a facility location problem and a multidimensional knapsack problem.

   between dominant length scales with changing temperature in a system
   with ramp-shaped repulsions. The latter type of interaction

Abstract = {{A state-based non-local peridynamic formulation is presented for
   simulating fluid driven fractures in an arbitrary heterogeneous
   poroelastic medium. A recently developed peridynamic formulation of
   porous flow has been coupled with the existing peridynamic formulation
   of solid and fracture mechanics resulting in a peridynamic model that
   for the first time simulates poroelasticity and fluid-driven fracture
   propagation. This coupling is achieved by modeling the role of pore
   pressure on the deformation of porous media and vice versa through
   porosity variation with medium deformation, pore pressure and total mean
   stress. The poroelastic model is verified by simulating the
   one-dimensional consolidation of fluid saturated rock. An additional
   porous flow equation with material permeability dependent on fracture
   width is solved to simulate fluid flow in the fractured region. Finally,
   single fluid-driven fracture propagation with a two-dimensional plane
   strain assumption is simulated and verified against the corresponding
   classical analytical solution.}},

Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Fire models are routinely used to evaluate life safety aspects of
   building design projects and are being used more often in fire and arson
   investigations as well as reconstructions of firefighter line-of-duty
   deaths and injuries. A fire within a compartment effectively leaves
   behind a record of fire activity and history (i.e., fire signatures).
   Fire and arson investigators can utilize these fire signatures in the
   determination of cause and origin during fire reconstruction exercises.
   Researchers conducting fire experiments can utilize this record of fire
   activity to better understand the underlying physics. In all of these
   applications, the heat release rate and location of a fire are important
   parameters that govern the evolution of thermal conditions within a fire
   compartment. These input parameters can be a large source of uncertainty
   in fire models, especially in scenarios in which experimental data or
   detailed information on fire behavior are not available. A methodology
   is sought to estimate the amount of certainty (or degree of belief) in
   the input parameters for hypothesized scenarios. To address this issue,
   an inversion framework was applied to scenarios that have relevance in
   fire scene reconstructions. Rather than using point estimates of input
   parameters, a statistical inversion framework based on the Bayesian
   inference approach was used to calculate probability distributions of
   input parameters. These probability distributions contain uncertainty
   information about the input parameters and can be propagated through
   fire models to obtain uncertainty information about predicted quantities
   of interest. The Bayesian inference approach was applied to various fire
   problems using different models: empirical correlations, zone models,
   and computational fluid dynamics fire models. Example applications
   include the estimation of steady-state fire sizes in a compartment and
   the location of a fire.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report an accurate quasi-saturation model and a nodal
   charge model for silicon-on-insulator lateral double-diffused
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (SOI-LDMOS) transistors. First, a model of a
   2-D SOI resistor under velocity saturation is developed, which is
   subsequently incorporated into the drift region of an LDMOS transistor
   to predict the quasi-saturation effect. The gate-voltage dependence of
   the quasi-saturation current is also modeled. Second, we propose a new
   nodal charge model to describe the dynamic behavior of the device.
   Comparisons of modeling results with device simulation data show that
   the proposed model is accurate over a wide range of bias. Scalability of
   the model with respect to the length of the drift region under the field
   oxide is also demonstrated. Finally, the model is validated under device
   self-heating conditions and by comparing it with the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of geogrid pullout tests conducted in
   wet and fine-grained soils. Failures of reinforced soil structures have
   often involved inadequate drainage due to the use of fine-grained soils,
   which has led to stringent specifications for backfill material in such
   structures although there are significant economic reasons for relieving
   the specifications. One approach to improve the issue is to reinforce
   fine-grained soils with geosynthetic providing both reinforcement and
   lateral drainage. Although using reinforcement with in-plane drainage
   capability is conceptually promising, transmissivity requirements for
   this application have not been properly evaluated. Pullout tests were
   conducted on cohesive soils using geogrids with the same tensile
   strength but with and without in-plane drainage channels. The results
   indicate that geogrids with in-plane drainage layers show higher pullout
   resistance than conventional geogrids. The finding contributes to
   promoting the use of poorly draining soils as backfill material.}},

   high precision positioning performance. Therefore, many tuning methods
   are proposed for PID controllers. In this work, three tuning methods,
   namely, Ziegler-Nichols step response method, Chien-Hrones-Reswick
   method and Cohen-Coon method are compared for PID control of a single
   axis of a XY stage of a 3D surface profiler. Positional errors are also

Abstract = {{Graphical models and related algorithmic tools such as belief
   propagation have proven to be useful tools in (approximately) solving
   combinatorial optimization problems across many application domains. A
   particularly combinatorially challenging problem is that of determining
   solutions to a set of simultaneous congruences. Specifically, a
   continuous source is encoded into multiple residues with respect to
   distinct moduli, and the goal is to recover the source efficiently from
   noisy measurements of these residues. This problem is of interest in
   multiple disciplines, including neural codes, decentralized compression
   in sensor networks, and distributed consensus in information and social
   networks. This letter reformulates the recovery problem as an
   optimization over binary latent variables. Then we present a belief
   propagation algorithm, a layered variant of affinity propagation, to
   solve the problem. The underlying encoding structure of multiple
   congruences naturally results in a layered graphical model for the
   problem, over which the algorithms are deployed, resulting in a layered
   affinity propagation (LAP) solution. First, the convergence of LAP to an
   approximation of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate is shown. Second,
   numerical simulations show that LAP converges within a few iterations
   and that the mean square error of LAP approaches that of the ML
   estimation at high signal-to-noise ratios.}},

   N) as opposed to O(N-5) of the straightforward velocity scan, with N
   being the representative of the number of points in a particular

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND The impact of amiodarone on ablation outcome in long-standing
   persistent atrial fibrillation (LSPAF) patients is not known yet.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of
   amiodarone on procedural-outcomes in LSPAF patients undergoing catheter
   ablation.
   METHODS We enrolled 112 LSPAF patients on amiodarone and scheduled to
   undergo atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Patients were randomized to
   amiodarone discontinuation 4 months before ablation (group 1, n = 56)
   and a control group (group 2, n = 56) in which ablation was performed
   without amiodarone discontinuation. All patients underwent pulmonary
   vein (PV) antrum and posterior wall isolation, defragmentation and extra
   PV triggers ablation. Patients were followed up for recurrence for 32
   +/- 8 months post-abLation. Repeat procedures in all recurrent patients
   were performed off amiodarone.
   RESULTS During ablation, AF termination was more frequent in group 2
   compared to group 1 {[}44 (79\%) vs 32 (57\%), P =.015]. After
   high-dosage isoproterenol, more non-PV triggers were disclosed in group
   1 compared to group 2 (42 {[}75\%] vs 24 {[}43\%] respectively, P
   <,001). Group 2 had lower procedure, radio-frequency and fluoroscopy
   times compared to group 1 (2.7 +/- 1 vs 3,1 +/- 1 h, 69 +/- 13 min vs 87
   +/- 11 min and 64 +/- 14 min vs 85 +/- 18 min respectively, p <.05). At
   32 +/- 8 month follow-up, on or off antiarrhythmic drug success rate was
   37 (66\%) in group 1 and 27 (48\%) in group 2 (P =.04). During redo, new
   non-PV trigger sites were identified in group 2 patients.
   CONCLUSION Periprocedural continuous amiodarone was associated with
   higher organization rate and lower radiofrequency ablation rate.
   However, masking non-PV triggers increased the late recurrence rate.}},

Abstract = {{Being able to predict the degree of visual discomfort that is felt when
   viewing stereoscopic 3D (S3D) images is an important goal toward
   ameliorating causative factors, such as excessive horizontal disparity,
   misalignments or mismatches between the left and right views of stereo
   pairs, or conflicts between different depth cues. Ideally, such a model
   should account for such factors as capture and viewing geometries, the
   distribution of disparities, and the responses of visual neurons. When
   viewing modern 3D displays, visual discomfort is caused primarily by
   changes in binocular vergence while accommodation in held fixed at the
   viewing distance to a flat 3D screen. This results in unnatural
   mismatches between ocular fixations and ocular focus that does not occur
   in normal direct 3D viewing. This accommodation vergence conflict can
   cause adverse effects, such as headaches, fatigue, eye strain, and
   reduced visual ability. Binocular vision is ultimately realized by means
   of neural mechanisms that subserve the sensorimotor control of eye
   movements. Realizing that the neuronal responses are directly implicated
   in both the control and experience of 3D perception, we have developed a
   model-based neuronal and statistical framework called the 3D visual
   discomfort predictor (3D-VDP) that automatically predicts the level of
   visual discomfort that is experienced when viewing S3D images. 3D-VDP
   extracts two types of features: 1) coarse features derived from the
   statistics of binocular disparities and 2) fine features derived by
   estimating the neural activity associated with the processing of
   horizontal disparities. In particular, we deploy a model of horizontal
   disparity processing in the extrastriate middle temporal region of
   occipital lobe. We compare the performance of 3D-VDP with other recent
   discomfort prediction algorithms with respect to correlation against
   recorded subjective visual discomfort scores, and show that 3D-VDP is
   statistically superior to the other methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hierarchical approach for estimating the mission
   feasibility, i.e., the probability of mission completion (PoMC), for
   mobile robotic systems operating in stochastic environments. Mobile
   robotic systems rely on onboard energy sources that are expended due to
   stochastic interactions with the environment. Resultantly, a bivariate
   distribution comprised of energy source (e.g., battery) run-time and
   mission time marginal distributions can be shown to represent a mission
   process that characterizes the distribution of all possible missions.
   Existing methodologies make independent stochastic predictions for
   battery run-time and mission time. The approach presented makes use of
   the marginal predictions, as prediction pairs, to allow for Bayesian
   correlation estimation and improved process characterization. To
   demonstrate both prediction accuracy and mission classification gains,
   the proposed methodology is validated using a novel experimental testbed
   that enables repeated battery discharge studies to be conducted as a
   small robotic ground vehicle traverses stochastic laboratory terrains.}},

Abstract = {{Many robotic applications need an accurate, robust, and fast estimation
   of finger pose. We present a novel finger pose estimation method using a
   motion capture system. The method combines a system identification stage
   and a state tracking stage in a unified framework. The system
   identification stage develops an accurate model of a finger, and the
   state tracking stage tracks the finger pose with the extended Kalman
   filter (EKF) algorithm based on the model obtained in the system
   identification stage. The algorithm is validated by simulation, and
   experiments with a human subject and a robotic finger. The experimental
   results show that the method can robustly estimate the finger pose at a
   high frequency (greater than 1 kHz) in the presence of measurement
   noise, occlusion of markers, and fast movement.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},

Abstract = {{The liquefaction potential of clean and silty sands is examined on the
   basis of the field measurement of the shear-wave velocity, Vs. The
   starting point is the database of 225 case histories supporting the
   Andrus-Stokoe Vs-based liquefaction chart for sands, silts, and gravels.
   Only clean and silty sands with nonplastic fines are considered,
   resulting in a reduced database of 110 case histories, which are plotted
   separately by type of deposit. A line of constant cyclic shear strain,
   cl approximate to 0.03\%, is recommended for liquefaction evaluation of
   recent uncompacted clean and silty sand fills and earthquake magnitude,
   Mw=7.5. The geologically recent natural silty sand sites in the Imperial
   Valley of southern California have significantly higher liquefaction
   resistance as a result of preshaking caused by the high seismic activity
   in the valley. A line of constant cyclic shear strain, cl approximate to
   0.1-0.2\%, is recommended for practical use in the Imperial Valley.
   Additional research including revisiting available Vs-based and
   penetration-based databases is proposed to generalize the results of the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Both deterioration and policy optimization models play a key role in
   pavement infrastructure management. A successful management system
   requires sound deterioration modeling as the basis for the policy
   optimization modeling and an effective integration of these two
   components. A significant amount of research has been conducted in both
   areas. However, an in-depth literature review suggests that a major
   aspect needs significant improvement-the development and integration of
   more comprehensive and realistic deterioration modeling for the
   selection of optimum rehabilitation policies. Deterioration models
   currently used are usually simple models due to lack of quality data or
   are often simplified to accommodate the optimization models for feasible
   solutions. Very few systems, if any, consider unobserved heterogeneity
   in the deterioration model involved in the policy optimization
   framework. To address this important aspect, this study developed a
   comprehensive pavement deterioration model incorporating both observed
   and unobserved heterogeneity. Furthermore, the results demonstrate how
   the established model is successfully integrated into the objective
   function to realize optimal rehabilitation policy in terms of total
   life-cycle cost. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   Progression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Transportation infrastructure condition (or distress) can be modeled as
   continuous or discrete variables. As discrete variables, they are
   commonly recorded with nonnegative integers. In deterioration models,
   these variables can be treated as count data. For this purpose, Poisson
   and Negative Binomial models are commonly used. The Negative Binomial
   model was proved to perform better than the Poisson model resulting from
   its ability to address a critical statistical issue: over-dispersion.
   This study employs an extension to improve these existing models. A
   Hurdle-Negative Binomial model is applied, which accounts not only for
   over-dispersion but also for different deterioration mechanisms between
   distress initiation and progression. A case study is conducted based on
   the observations of real-world pavement cracking conditions. The
   advantages of this approach are demonstrated through integrating two
   joint deterioration models, which estimate the crack initiation
   probability with a choice model and the probabilities of numbers of
   progressed cracks with a truncated Negative Binomial model,
   respectively. The Hurdle-Negative Binomial model is shown to outperform
   the previous models from both statistical and engineering perspectives.

Abstract = {{Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators that
   have been identified in multiple species and shown to play essential
   roles in responsive mechanisms to environmental stresses. The natural
   ability of specific bacteria to resist high levels of radiation has been
   of high interest to mechanistic studies of DNA repair and biomolecular
   protection. Deinococcus radiodurans is a model extremophile for
   radiation studies that can survive doses of ionizing radiation of
   >12,000 Gy, 3,000 times higher than for most vertebrates. Few studies
   have investigated posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of this
   organism that could be relevant in its general gene regulatory patterns.
   In this study, we identified 199 potential sRNA candidates in D.
   radiodurans by whole-transcriptome deep sequencing analysis and
   confirmed the expression of 41 sRNAs by Northern blotting and reverse
   transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). A total of 8 confirmed sRNAs showed
   differential expression during recovery after acute ionizing radiation
   (15 kGy). We have also found and confirmed 7 sRNAs in Deinococcus
   geothermalis, a closely related radioresistant species. The

Abstract = {{Greedy motion planning strategies to enhance situational awareness in an
   opportunistic navigation (OpNav) environment are considered. An OpNav
   environment can be thought of as a radio frequency signal landscape
   within which a receiver locates itself in time and space by extracting
   information from ambient signals of opportunity (SOPs). The receiver is
   assumed to draw only pseudorange observations from the SOPs. The
   following problem is considered. A receiver with no a priori knowledge
   about its own initial states nor the initial states of multiple SOPs,
   except for one, is dropped in an OpNav environment. Assuming that the
   receiver can prescribe its maneuvers, what greedy (i.e., one-step
   look-ahead) motion planning strategy should the receiver adopt so to
   optimally build a high-fidelity signal landscape map of the environment
   while simultaneously localizing itself within this map in time and space
   with high accuracy? Several information-based and innovation-based
   motion planning strategies are studied. It is shown that with proper
   reformulation, the innovation-based strategies can be cast as tractable
   convex programs, the solution of which is computationally efficient.
   Simulation results are presented comparing the various strategies and
   illustrating the improvements gained from adopting the proposed
   strategies over random and predefined receiver trajectories.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{344-354}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Household wastewater, especially from conventional septic systems, is a
   major contributor to nitrogen pollution. Alternative household
   wastewater management technologies provide similar sewerage management
   services but their life cycle costs and nitrogen flow implications
   remain uncertain. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) what are
   the total costs, nitrogen mitigation potential, and cost-effectiveness
   of a range of conventional and alternative municipal wastewater
   treatment technologies, and (2) what uncertainties influence these
   outcomes and how can we improve our understanding of these technologies?
   We estimate a household nitrogen mass balance for various household
   wastewater treatment systems and combine this mass balance with life
   cycle cost assessment to calculate the cost-effectiveness of nitrogen
   mitigation, which we define as nitrogen removed from the local
   watershed. We apply our methods to Falmouth, MA, where failing septic
   systems have caused heightened eutrophication in local receiving water
   bodies. We find that flushing and dry (composting) urine-diversion
   toilets paired with conventional septic systems for greywater management
   demonstrate the lowest life cycle cost and highest cost-effectiveness
   (dollars per kilogram of nitrogen removed from the watershed).
   Composting toilets are also attractive options in some cases,
   particularly best-case nitrogen mitigation. Innovative/advanced septic
   systems designed for high-level nitrogen removal are cost-competitive
   options for newly constructed homes, except at their most expensive. A
   centralized wastewater treatment plant is the most expensive and least
   cost-effective option in all cases. Using a greywater recycling system
   with any treatment technology increases the cost without adding any
   nitrogen removal benefits. Sensitivity analysis shows that these results
   are robust considering a range of cases and uncertainties. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Tissues in the body are hierarchically structured composite materials
   with tissue-specific chemical and topographical properties. Here we
   report the preparation of tissue scaffolds with macroscopic pores
   generated via the dissolution of a sacrificial supramolecular
   polymer-based crystal template (urea) from a biodegradable polymer-based
   scaffold (polycaprolactone, PCL). Furthermore, we report a method of
   aligning the supramolecular polymer-based crystals within the PCL, and
   that the dissolution of the sacrificial urea yields scaffolds with
   macroscopic pores that are aligned over long, clinically-relevant
   distances (i.e., centimeter scale). The pores act as topographical cues
   to which rat Schwann cells respond by aligning with the long axis of the
   pores. Generation of an interpenetrating network of polypyrrole (PPy)
   and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) in the scaffolds yields electroactive
   tissue scaffolds that allow the electrical stimulation of Schwann cells
   cultured on the scaffolds which increases the production of nerve growth
   factor (NGF).}},

Abstract = {{Determining maintenance policies based purely on cost-minimization
   principles may result in an inequitable distribution of funding and
   benefits-in practice, such models often recommend allocating much more
   funding to urban areas than rural, which is arguably unfair and
   politically infeasible. This paper considers how preference for
   equitable distribution of benefits can be incorporated into
   network-level maintenance optimization problems. In particular, several
   seemingly natural choices for capturing inequity lead to nonconvex
   formulations. Accordingly, this paper investigates a class of functions
   for measuring inequity and identifies specifications which preserve
   convexity and lend themselves to easy optimization problems. These
   alternative specifications are compared on a fictitious network. Within
   this data set, considerable gains in equity are possible with only
   slight increases in total user cost.}},

Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{37-45}},

Abstract = {{Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) has been widely used as the electrode material in
   touch-screen displays and solar cells attributing to its combined high
   electrical conductivity and optical transparency. Moving forward from
   wafer based electronics to flexible/stretchable electronics, brittle
   electronic materials like ITO are significantly hindering the
   deformability of the integrated systems. To minimize strains in
   inorganic materials when subjected to stretch, thin metallic and ceramic
   films can be patterned into serpentine-shaped ribbons. Although
   polymer-supported metallic serpentines have received extensive studies,
   it has been a challenging task to fabricate brittle ceramic serpentine
   ribbons on stretchable substrates. In this letter, we report a low cost,
   completely dry fabrication process to successfully integrate brittle ITO
   serpentine ribbons on stretchable substrates. Uniaxial tension tests are
   performed with in situ electrical resistance measurements which are used
   as an indicator of the mechanical integrity of the ITO ribbons. Effects
   of serpentine-substrate adhesion and serpentine geometry are
   systematically investigated. When the adhesion is weak, stretchability
   as high as 200\% can be achieved. When the adhesion is strong, a new
   failure mechanism is observed. Design guidelines can be proposed for
   different adhesion conditions based on this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new process, decoupled functional imprint lithography (D-FIL), is
   presented for fabricating low elastic modulus polymeric nanocarriers
   possessing Young's modulus of bulk material as low as sub-1 MPa. This
   method is employed to fabricate sub-50 nm diameter cylinders with >3: 1
   aspect ratio and other challenging shapes from low elastic modulus
   polymers such as N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and poly(ethylene glycol)
   di-acrylate (PEGDA), possessing Young's modulus of bulk material <10 MPa
   which is cannot otherwise be imprinted in similar size and pitch using
   existing imprint techniques. Standard imprint lithography polymers have
   Young's modulus >1 GPa, and so these polymers used in nanocarrier
   fabrication in comparison have very low elastic modulus. Monodispersed,
   shape-and size-specific nanocarriers composed of NIPAM with material
   elastic modulus of <1MPa have been fabricated and show thermal
   responsive behavior at the lower critical solubility temperature (LCST)
   of similar to 32 degrees C. In addition, re-entrant shaped nanocarriers
   composed of PEGDA with elastic modulus <10 MPa are also fabricated.
   Nanocarriers fabricated from PEGDA are shown with model imaging agent
   and anticancer drug (Doxorubicin) encapsulated in as small as 50 nm

Title = {{Simulation of hydraulic fracturing in quasi-brittle shale formations
   using characterized cohesive layer: Stimulation controlling factors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{65-83}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Economic production from shale gas cannot be achieved by natural
   mechanisms alone; it requires technologies such as hydraulic fracturing
   in multiple stages along a horizontal wellbore. Developing numerical
   models for hydraulic fracturing is essential since a successful
   fracturing job in a shale formation cannot be generalized to another due
   to different shale characteristics, and restricted access to the field
   data acquisition. The cohesive zone model (CZM) identifies the plastic
   zone and softening effects at the fracture tip in a quasi-brittle rock
   such as shale, which leads to a more precise fracture geometry and
   injection pressure compared to those from linear elastic fracture
   mechanics. The incorporation of CZM in a fully coupled pore
   pressure-stress, finite element analysis provides a rigorous tool to
   include also the significant effect of in situ stresses in large matrix
   deformations on the fracturing fluid flow components, for instance
   leak-off. In this work, we modeled single and double-stage fracturing in
   a quasi-brittle shale layer using an improved CZM for porous media
   besides including the material softening effect and a new boundary
   condition treatment, using infinite elements connecting the domain of
   interest to the surrounding rock layers. Due to the lack of experimental
   data for the cohesive layer properties, we characterized the cohesive
   layer by sensitivity study on the stiffness, fracture initiation stress,
   and energy release rate. We demonstrated the significance of rock
   mechanical properties, pumping rate, viscosity, and leak-off in the
   pumping pressure, and fracture aperture. Moreover, we concluded that the
   stress shadowing effects of hydraulic fractures on each other majorly
   affects not only fractures' length, height, aperture, and the required
   injection pressure, but also their connection to the injection spot.
   Also, we investigated two scenarios in the sequence of fracturing
   stages, simultaneous and sequential, with various fracture spacing and
   recommended the best scenario among them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Experimental and theoretical analysis of an aluminum foam enhanced phase

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{273-281}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates heat transfer enhancement of a shell-and-tube
   latent heat thermal storage unit, using water as the phase change
   material, by addition of open-cell aluminum foam. Two shell-and-tube
   thermal storage units were designed and fabricated such that they were
   identical except for the inclusion of aluminum foam in one unit. The
   experimental results indicated that the foam significantly increased the
   heat transfer during both solidification and melting, as characterized
   by the overall heat transfer coefficient. The relative enhancement was
   greater for melting than solidification due to the lower thermal
   conductivity of liquid water relative to ice. It was also observed that
   natural convection during melting was suppressed by the foam but that
   this suppression was still outweighed by the thermal conductance
   enhancement. Using a semi-analytical approach to model the coupled phase
   change and forced convection heat transfer, best-fit effective thermal
   conductivities for the water foam composite were determined to be 1.8
   W/m-K during melting and 5.1 W/m-K during solidification. The value
   obtained in this work for melting is significantly lower than
   predictions from existing effective thermal conductivity models for foam
   composites, and as is shown, the impact of this discrepancy on the
   overall thermal performance of the thermal storage unit is significant.
   The value obtained for solidification is also less than that predicted
   by the same thermal conductivity models; however, for solidification,
   the impact of this discrepancy is smaller. The discrepancies between
   values obtained in this work and effective thermal conductivity models
   is attributed to local thermal non-equilibrium, which is more severe
   during melting than solidification due to the lower thermal conductivity
   of liquid water relative to ice. This finding is further demonstrated by
   numerical investigation of phase change in a representative composite
   material containing a foam-like structure modeled on the well-known
   Kelvin cell. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The application of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to the numerical
   solution of the two- and three-dimensional shallow water equations has
   seen increased interest over the past decade. In this article, previous
   work by the second author and several collaborators on the application
   and analysis of the DG method is extended to coupled shallow water/bed
   morphology dynamics, also called morphodynamics. Morphodynamic boundary
   value problems are used to simultaneously model shallow water
   hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes in estuarine and coastal
   systems. The governing equations of interest arise when the
   two-dimensional Saint-Venant equations are tightly coupled to the
   corresponding Exner equation. The tight coupling of these two processes
   presents numerous modeling and analytical challenges. The resulting
   nonlinear system is incompletely parabolic, and contains a
   nonconservative product. In this work, some of these analytical
   challenges are tackled by applying a local discontinuous Galerkin method
   to the morphodynamic system; the quantities of interest and their
   gradients are solved separately. A general, semidiscrete finite element
   formulation is presented, and after justifying some mild assumptions, a
   new a priori error estimate for the system is derived. (c) 2014 Wiley

Title = {{On the detectability of transverse cracks in laminated composites using
   electrical potential change measurements}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{237-246}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Real-time health monitoring of structures made of laminated composites
   is necessary as significant damage may occur without any visible signs
   on the surface. Inspection by electrical tomography (ET) seems a viable
   approach that relies on voltage measurements from a network of
   electrodes across the inspected domain to infer conductivity change
   within the bulk material. If conductivity decreases significantly with
   increasing damage, the obtained conductivity map can be correlated to
   the degradation state of the material. We focus here on detection of
   transverse cracks. As transverse cracks modify the in-plane transverse
   conductivity of a single ply, we expect them to be detectable by
   electrical measurements. Yet, the quality of detection is directly
   related to the sensitivity of the measurements to the presence of
   cracks. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate that the sensitivity
   depends on several material and geometrical parameters. Based on the
   results, the applicability of ET to detect transverse cracks is
   discussed. One conclusion from the study is that detecting transverse
   cracks using ET is more reliable in some laminate configurations than in
   others. Recommendations about the properties of either the pristine
   material or the inspected structures are provided to establish if ET is
   reliable in detecting transverse cracks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Orthogonally functionalized nanopatterend surfaces presenting discrete
   domains of fibronectin ranging from 92 to 405 nm were implemented to
   investigate the influence of limiting adhesion site growth on cell
   migration. We demonstrate that limiting adhesion site growth to small,
   immature adhesions using sub-100 nm patterns induced cells to form a
   significantly increased number of smaller, more densely packed adhesions
   that displayed few interactions with actin stress fibers. Human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells exhibiting these traits displayed
   highly dynamic fluctuations in spreading and a 4.8-fold increase in
   speed compared to cells on nonpatterned controls. As adhesions were
   allowed to mature in size in cells cultured on larger nanopatterns, 222
   to 405 nm, the dynamic fluctuations in spread area and migration began
   to slow, yet cells still displayed a 2.1-fold increase in speed compared
   to controls. As all restrictions on adhesion site growth were lifted
   using nonpatterned controls, cells formed significantly fewer, less
   densely packed, larger, mature adhesions that acted as terminating sites
   for actin stress fibers and significantly slower migration. The results
   revealed an exponential decay in cell speed with increased adhesion site
   size, indicating that preventing the formation of large mature adhesions
   may disrupt cell stability thereby inducing highly migratory behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium is globally available, which makes a sodium-ion rechargeable
   battery preferable to a lithium-ion battery for large-scale storage of
   electrical energy, provided a host cathode for Na can be found that
   provides the necessary capacity, voltage, and cycle life at the
   prescribed charge/discharge rate. Low-cost hexacyanometallates are
   promising cathodes because of their ease of synthesis and rigid open
   framework that enables fast Na+ insertion and extraction. Here we report
   an intriguing effect of interstitial H2O on the structure and
   electrochemical properties of sodium manganese(II) hexacyanoferrates(II)
   with the nominal composition Na2MnFe(CN)(6)(.)zH(2)O (Na-2-delta MnHFC).
   The newly discovered dehydrated Na2-delta MnHFC phase exhibits superior
   electrochemical performance compared to other reported Na-ion cathode
   materials; it delivers at 3.5 V a reversible capacity of 150 mAh g(-1)
   in a sodium half cell and 140 mAh g(-1) in a full cell with a
   hard-carbon anode. At a charge/discharge rate of 20 C, the half-cell
   capacity is 120 mAh g(-1), and at 0.7 C, the cell exhibits 75\% capacity
   retention after 500 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Stimuli-responsive hydrogels with decent electrical properties are a
   promising class of polymeric materials for a range of technological
   applications, such as electrical, electrochemical, and biomedical
   devices. In this paper, thermally responsive and conductive hybrid
   hydrogels are synthesized by in situ formation of continuous network of
   conductive polymer hydrogels crosslinked by phytic acid in
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) matrix. The interpenetrating binary network
   structure provides the hybrid hydrogels with continuous transporting
   path for electrons, highly porous microstructure, strong interactions
   between two hydrogel networks, thus endowing the hybrid hydrogels with a
   unique combination of high electrical conductivity (up to 0.8 S m(-1)),
   high thermoresponsive sensitivity (significant volume change within
   several seconds), and greatly enhanced mechanical properties. This work
   demonstrates that the architecture of the filling phase in the hydrogel
   matrix and design of hybrid hydrogel structure play an important role in
   determining the performance of the resulting hybrid material. The
   attractive performance of these hybrid hydrogels is further demonstrated
   by the developed switcher device which suggests potential applications

Abstract = {{Liquid imbibition, the capillary-pressure-driven flow of a liquid into a
   gas, provides a mechanism for studying the effects of solid-liquid and
   solid-liquid-gas interfaces on nanoscale transport. Deviations from the
   classic Washburn equation for imbibition are generally observed for
   nanoscale imbibition, but the identification of the origin of these
   irregularities in terms of transport variables varies greatly among
   investigators. We present an experimental method and corresponding image
   and data analysis scheme that enable the determination of independent
   effective values of nanoscale capillary pressure, liquid viscosity, and
   interfacial gas partitioning coefficients, all critical transport
   variables, from imbibition within nanochannels. Experiments documented
   herein are performed within two-dimensional siliceous nanochannels of
   varying size and as small as 30 nm x 60 nm in cross section. The wetting
   fluid used is the organic solvent isopropanol and the nonwetting fluid
   is air, but investigations are not limited to these fluids. Optical data
   of dynamic flow are rare in geometries that are nanoscale in two
   dimensions due to the limited resolution of optical microscopy. We are
   able to capture tracer-free liquid imbibition with reflected
   differential interference contrast microscopy. Results with isopropanol
   show a significant departure from bulk transport values in the
   nanochannels: reduced capillary pressures, increased liquid viscosity,
   and nonconstant interfacial mass-transfer coefficients. The findings
   equate to the nucleation of structured, quasi-crystalline boundary
   layers consistently similar to 10-25 nm in extent. This length is far
   thicker than the boundary layer range prescribed by long-range
   intermolecular force interactions. Slower but linear imbibition in some
   experimental cases suggests that structured boundary layers may inhibit
   viscous drag at confinement walls for critical nanochannel dimensions.
   Probing the effects of nanoconfinement on the definitions of capillary
   pressure, viscosity, and interfacial mass transfer is critical in
   determining and improving the functionality and fluid transport efficacy
   of geological, biological, and synthetic nanoporous media and materials.}},

Abstract = {{Electrofreezing is the electrically induced nucleation of ice from
   supercooled water. This work studies ice nucleation in electrowetted
   water droplets, wherein there is no electric field inside the droplet
   resting on a dielectric layer. Instead, there is an interfacial electric
   field and charge buildup at the solid-liquid interface. This situation
   is in contrast to most previous electrofreezing studies, which have used
   bare electrodes, involve current flow, and have a volumetric electric
   field inside the liquid. Infrared and high-speed visualizations of
   static water droplets are used to analyze surface electrofreezing.
   Ultrahigh electric fields of up to 80 V/mu m are applied, which is one
   order of magnitude higher than in previous studies. The results
   facilitate an in-depth understanding of various mechanisms underlying
   electrofreezing. First, it is seen that interfacial electric fields
   alone can significantly elevate freezing temperatures by more than 15
   degrees C, in the absence of current flow. Second, the magnitude of
   electrofreezing induced temperature elevation saturates at high electric
   field strengths. Third, the polarity of the interfacial charge does not
   significantly influence electrofreezing. Overall, it is seen that
   electrofreezing nucleation kinetics is primarily influenced by the
   three-phase boundary and not the solid-liquid interface. Through careful
   electrofreezing measurements on dielectric layers with pinholes to allow
   current flow, the individual role of electric fields and electric
   currents on electrofreezing is isolated. It is seen that both the
   electric field and the electric current influence electrofreezing;
   however, the physical mechanisms are very different.}},

Abstract = {{We present an updated analysis of LHS 6343, a triple system in the
   Kepler field which consists of a brown dwarf transiting one member of a
   widely separated M+M binary system. By analyzing the full Kepler data
   set and 34 Keck/HIgh Resolution Echelle Spectrometer radial velocity
   observations, we measure both the observed transit depth and Doppler
   semiamplitude to 0.5\% precision. With Robo-AO and Palomar/PHARO
   adaptive optics imaging as well as TripleSpec spectroscopy, we measure a
   model-dependent mass for LHS 6343 C of 62.1 +/- 1.2 M-Jup and a radius
   of 0.783 +/- 0.011 R-Jup. We detect the secondary eclipse in the Kepler
   data at 3.5 sigma, measuring e cos omega = 0.0228 +/- 0.0008. We also
   derive a method to measure the mass and radius of a star and transiting
   companion directly, without any direct reliance on stellar models. The
   mass and radius of both objects depend only on the orbital period,
   stellar density, reduced semimajor axis, Doppler semiamplitude,
   eccentricity, and inclination, as well as the knowledge that the primary
   star falls on the main sequence. With this method, we calculate a mass
   and radius for LHS 6343 C to a precision of 3\% and 2\%, respectively.}},

   rock-fluid system is essential to understand the attractive forces
   between the various phases (crudes, brines and the rock surface). These

   reservoir rock surface. Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) is used to
   characterize the surface chemistry of a Saudi Arabian reservoir rock
   (henceforth referred to as `reservoir rock') at different moisture
   coverage and temperatures. This information combined with the surface
   tension of the interacting reservoir fluids is utilized to develop a new
   method for quantifying wettability in terms of a wettability index. This
   index is based on the relative magnitude of the work of adhesion between
   the rock surface and the competing oleic/aqueous phase. Published by

Abstract = {{The magnitude of the membrane dipole field was measured using
   vibrational Stark effect (VSE) shifts of nitrile oscillators placed on
   the unnatural amino acid p-cyanophenylalanine (p-CN-Phe) added to a
   peptide sequence at four unique positions. These peptides, which were
   based on a repeating alanine-leucine motif, intercalated into small
   unilamellar DMPC vesicles which formed an a-helix as confirmed by
   circular dichroic (CD) spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations of
   the membrane-intercalated helix containing two of the nitrile probes,
   one near the headgroup region of the lipid (alpha LAX(25)) and one
   buried in the interior of the bilayer (alpha LAX(16)), were used to
   examine the structure of the nitrile with respect to the membrane
   normal, the assumed direction of the dipole field, by quantifying both a
   small tilt of the helix in the bilayer and conformational rotation of
   the p-CN-Phe side chain at steady state. Vibrational absorption energies
   of the nitrile oscillator at each position showed a systematic blue
   shift as the nitrile was stepped toward the membrane interior; for
   several different concentrations of peptide, the absorption energy of
   the nitrile located in the middle of the bilayer was similar to 3 cm(-1)
   greater than that of the nitrile closest to the surface of the membrane.
   Taken together, the measured VSE shifts and nitrile orientations within
   the membrane resulted in an absolute magnitude of 8-11 MV/cm for the
   dipole field, at the high end of the range of possible values that have
   been accumulated from a variety of indirect measurements. Implications
   for this are discussed.}},

Title = {{Hybrid and Aqueous Lithium-Air Batteries}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Lithium-air (Li-air) batteries have become attractive because of their
   extremely high theoretical energy density. However, conventional Li-air
   cells operating with non-aqueous electrolytes suffer from poor cycle
   life and low practical energy density due to the clogging of the porous
   air cathode by insoluble discharge products, contamination of the
   organic electrolyte and lithium metal anode by moist air, and
   decomposition of the electrolyte during cycling. These difficulties may
   be overcome by adopting a cell configuration that consists of a
   lithium-metal anode protected from air by a Li+-ion solid electrolyte
   and an air electrode in an aqueous catholyte. In this type of
   configuration, a Li+-ion conducting buffer layer between the
   lithium-metal anode and the solid electrolyte is often necessary due to
   the instability of many solid electrolytes in contact with lithium
   metal. Based on the type of buffer layer, two different battery
   configurations are possible: hybrid Li-air batteries and aqueous Li-air
   batteries. The hybrid and aqueous Li-air batteries utilize the same
   battery chemistry and face similar challenges that limit the cell
   performance. Here, an overview of recent developments in hybrid and
   aqueous Li-air batteries is provided and the factors that influence
   their performance and impede their practical applications, followed by
   future directions are discussed.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Month = {{FEB 17}},
Abstract = {{In order to elucidate the origin of the ferromagnetism found in
   underdoped La1-xSrxMnO3, we have grown a series of single crystals with
   a fine step of doping and characterized them with a structural study and
   measurements of magnetization, resistivity, thermoelectric power, and
   thermal conductivity. The paramagnetic phase of the underdoped
   La1-xSrxMnO3 is a small-polaron conductor. However, the Weiss constant
   extracted from the paramagnetic susceptibility shows a ferromagnetic
   coupling and tracks the Curie temperature. Given that the double
   exchange interaction cannot be delivered by the hopping motion of small
   polarons, we have made a systematic analysis of the structural changes
   with x and studied whether the superexchange interaction can account for
   the ferromagnetic coupling found in the paramagnetic phase. Intrinsic
   local site distortions in LaMnO3 change as x increases in La1-xSrxMnO3.
   The influence of the local structural distortion and the cooperative
   orbital ordering on lattice parameters have been demonstrated by a
   comparison between the measured change of lattice parameters versus hole
   doping and a simulation with the software SPuDs, in which rigid
   octahedra are assumed. Changes with x of the bond length splitting in
   MnO6 octahedra induces an orbital mixing of (3x(2) - r(2)) + (y(2) -
   z(2)) or (3y(2) - r(2)) + (z(2) - x(2)), which progressively converts
   two-dimensional ferromagnetism in the parent perovskite LaMnO3 into
   three-dimensional ferromagnetism. The correlation between the particular
   lattice distortions and the cooperative orbital ordering and orbital
   mixing can in turn be used to test the superexchange model by measuring
   the change of transition temperatures under uniaxial stress. Nearly
   identical uniaxial stress effects found in crystals of the mixed-valent
   La0.875Sr.125MnO3 and single-valent LaMn0.5Ga0.5O3 confirm unambiguously
   that superexchange interactions play the dominant role in the
   ferromagnetic coupling of underdoped La1-xSrxMnO3.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the one-dimensional volatility basis set (1D-VBS) and
   two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) in simulating the aging of
   SOA derived from toluene and a-pinene against smog-chamber experiments.
   If we simulate the first-generation products with empirical chamber fits
   and the subsequent aging chemistry with a 1D-VBS or a 2D-VBS, the models
   mostly overestimate the SOA concentrations in the toluene oxidation
   experiments. This is because the empirical chamber fits include both
   first-generation oxidation and aging; simulating aging in addition to
   this results in double counting of the initial aging effects. If the
   first-generation oxidation is treated explicitly, the base-case 2D-VBS
   underestimates the SOA concentrations and O:C increase of the toluene
   oxidation experiments; it generally underestimates the SOA
   concentrations and overestimates the O:C increase of the a-pinene
   experiments. With the first-generation oxidation treated explicitly, we
   could modify the 2D-VBS configuration individually for toluene and
   alpha-pinene to achieve good model-measurement agreement. However, we
   are unable to simulate the oxidation of both toluene and a-pinene with
   the same 2D-VBS configuration. We suggest that future models should
   implement parallel layers for anthropogenic (aromatic) and biogenic
   precursors, and that more modeling studies and laboratory research be
   done to optimize the best-guess parameters for each layer.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels are widely used as in vitro culture models to mimic 3D
   cellular microenvironments. The stiffness of the extracellular matrix is
   known to influence cell phenotype, inspiring work toward unraveling the
   role of stiffness on cell behavior using hydrogels. However, in many
   biological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and
   tumorigenesis, the microenvironment is highly dynamic, leading to
   changes in matrix stiffness over a broad range of timescales. To
   recapitulate dynamic microenvironments, a hydrogel with temporally
   tunable stiffness is needed. Here, we present a system in which alginate
   gel stiffness can be temporally modulated by light-triggered release of
   calcium or a chelator from liposomes. Others have shown softening via
   photodegradation or stiffening via secondary cross-linking; however, our
   system is capable of both dynamic stiffening and softening. Dynamic
   modulation of stiffness can be induced at least 14 d after gelation and
   can be spatially controlled to produce gradients and patterns. We use
   this system to investigate the regulation of fibroblast morphology by
   stiffness in both nondegradable gels and gels with degradable elements.
   Interestingly, stiffening inhibits fibroblast spreading through either
   mesenchymal or amoeboid migration modes. We demonstrate this technology
   can be translated in vivo by using deeply penetrating near-infrared
   light for transdermal stiffness modulation, enabling external control of
   gel stiffness. Temporal modulation of hydrogel stiffness is a powerful
   tool that will enable investigation of the role that dynamic
   microenvironments play in biological processes both in vitro and in
   well-controlled in vivo experiments.}},

Abstract = {{It is highly desirable to precisely tune the molecule release rate from
   the surfaces of nanoparticles (NPs) that are relevant to cancer therapy
   and single-cell biology. An innovative mechanism is reported to actively
   tune the biochemical release rate by rotation of NPs. Plasmonic
   nanomotors were assembled from NPs and applied in multiplex biochemical
   release and detection. Both single and multiplex biosignals can be
   released in a tunable fashion by controlling the rotation speed of the
   nanomotors. The chemistry and release rate of individual chemicals can
   be revealed by Raman spectroscopy. The fundamental mechanism was modeled
   quantitatively and attributed to the fluidic boundary-layer reduction
   owing to the liquid convection. This work, which explored the
   synergistic attributes of surface enhanced Raman scattering and
   nanoelectromechanical systems, could inspire new sensors that are
   potentially interesting for various bio-applications.}},

Abstract = {{Stabilization of Ta-Ta bonding in an oxide across a shared
   octahedral-site edge of a Ta-2 dimer is not known. Investigation of Li
   insertion into the trirutile structure of MTa2O6 with M = Mg, Cr, Fe,

   octahedral-site edge of the dimer can be stabilized by a reversible
   electrochemical reduction of Ta-V to Ta-IV for M = Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni
   but not for M = Mg. Chemical reduction of MTa2O6 by n-butyl lithium only
   reduced NiTa2O6 to any significant extent. With M = Fe, Co, or Ni,
   electrochemical formation of the Ta-Ta bonds is accompanied by a partial
   reduction of the Fe-II, Co-II, or Ni-II to Fe-0, Co-0, or Ni-0. For M =
   Cr, two Li per formula unit can be inserted reversibly with no
   displacement of Cr-0. For M = Mg, no Mg-II are displaced by Li
   insertion, but a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is formed on
   the oxide with no evidence of Ta-Ta bonding. Stabilization of Ta-Ta
   bonding across a shared octahedral-site edge in a dimer appears to

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{111-124}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The pore network in shale reservoirs consists of pores associated with
   both organic matter and inorganic matrix. The range of pore sizes within
   the organic matter is usually an order of magnitude smaller than pore
   sizes within the inorganic matrix, causing a bimodal pore-size
   distribution for the total system revealed in nitrogen adsorption tests.
   We use a stochastic classification method based on a mixture of Gaussian
   assumption to separate two distributions of pores in organic matter and
   inorganic matrix. We construct an ensemble-based stochastic model
   conditioned to total organic content (TOC) and the characteristics of
   pore-size distributions in organic and inorganic media. This treatment
   of different pore sizes in organic and inorganic enables us to assign
   sorption process only in organic matter. The model can be used to
   calculate the apparent gas permeability (AP) in shale from a combination
   of nitrogen-adsorption and SEM-image data. We validate the model with
   data from the literature, and use it to determine permeability and
   tortuosity from pulse-decay experimental data. The model results show
   that AP is more sensitive to the mean of pores within inorganic matrix
   than within organic matter. These results suggest that pore sizes
   corresponding to each compartment; organic and inorganic should be
   considered to estimate permeability. The model results also confirm
   permeability enhancement owing to the sorption process in organic matter
   below-critical sorption pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A database of permeability, diffusivity and solubility for He, H-2, O-2,

   These data were compared with results for a similar study conducted for
   glassy polymers published in 2013. Based on this comparison, glassy
   polymers have higher solubility coefficients than rubbery polymers due
   to the excess volume (or free volume) stemming from the non-equilibrium
   nature of polymers below the glass transition temperature, T-g, which is
   well described by the dual-mode sorption model. When compared at equal
   permeability, rubbery polymers have higher diffusion coefficients and
   lower solubility coefficients. Polymers having permselectivity values at
   or near the upper bound are virtually all glassy polymers. This
   phenomenon is widely ascribed to the better diffusivity selectivity of
   glassy versus rubbery polymers. Comparison of the upper-bound plot of
   log P-i/P-j versus log P-i (where P-i represents the permeability of the
   more permeable gas) shows that glassy polymers dominate the upper bounds
   for all 15 gas pairs possible. However, when log P-i/P-i is plotted
   versus log D-i, many of the gas pairs have overlapping data for glassy
   and rubbery polymers. Thus, glassy polymers dominate the upper bound
   due, in part, to their higher solubility coefficients (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{While mature oil reservoirs and aquifers are considered to be good
   potential candidates for CO2 sequestration, we proposed and investigated
   an alternative which combines CO2 sequestration and CO2 EOR at the very
   start of production in a gas condensate reservoir. First, we established
   a co-simulation workflow with a combination of compositional reservoir
   simulation and synthetic seismic simulation. Next, we conducted
   compositional reservoir simulation and synthetic seismic simulation in a
   five-spot well pattern to investigate whether seismic data can monitor
   the CO2 front and gas condensate bank with CO2 injected from the very
   beginning of well production. Then, we compared the compositional
   simulation results with the seismic simulation results. Although the
   density contrast among reservoir gas, injected CO2, and condensate is
   lower than the density contrast in the case of CO2 sequestration in
   aquifers, the seismic signal may have the potential to capture this
   smaller difference, monitor the CO2 injection front, and locate the
   condensate zone, depending on the temperature, pressure and phase
   properties. When no adequate data are available for reservoir
   characterization at an early period of production, the seismic data is
   the only direct measurement of inter-well properties. It may be very
   valuable for reservoir characterization and for the evaluation of the
   condensate block. It can serve as the basis for time-lapse monitoring.
   We compare production by natural depletion with production by CO2 EOR
   and sequestration started at the very beginning of well production. It
   shows that the latter will speed up the recovery process and increase
   the recovery rate while simultaneously storing a large amount of CO2 in
   the reservoir. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{189-198}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Uniform proppant distribution in multiple perforation clusters after
   hydraulic fracturing plays an important role in the commercial
   production of shale gas. However, it is very challenging to achieve a
   uniform proppant distribution during operation. In some cases, proppant
   distribution is uneven in different clusters within the same hydraulic
   fracturing stage. The effect of the uneven proppant distribution on well
   performance is not well understood and has been largely neglected in
   most reservoir simulations. Hence, it is paramount to develop a
   reservoir simulation approach to properly examine the relationship
   between proppant distribution and well performance for shale gas
   reservoirs. In this paper, we use numerical reservoir simulation to
   model the proppant distribution. The reservoir model with multiple
   hydraulic fractures is validated by field production data from Marcellus
   shale. Effects of gas desorption and stress-dependent fracture
   conductivity are considered in the simulation model. We perform
   sensitivity studies to quantify the key parameters affecting the well
   performance between uniform and non-uniform proppant distribution. The
   six variables, which are cluster spacing, initial reservoir pressure,
   fracture conductivity, fracture half-length, fracture height, and matrix
   permeability, are investigated. The fracture conductivity ratio of
   1:1.5:2.5:4 for four clusters in the same fracturing stage is
   investigated for the uneven proppant distribution scenario. This work
   provides insights into a better understanding of the effect of proppant
   distribution on well performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The theory of non-orthogonal spin-adaptation for closed-shell molecular
   systems is applied to coupled cluster methods with quadruple excitations

   With respect to the implementation of CCSDTQ and related methods, we
   show that there are significant advantages to non-orthogonal
   spin-adaption with respect to simplification and factorization of the
   working equations and to creating an efficient implementation. The
   resulting algorithm is implemented in the CFOUR program suite for CCSDT,

Abstract = {{Motor imagery (MI) has shown effectiveness in enhancing motor
   performance. This may be due to the common neural mechanisms underlying
   MI and motor execution (ME). The main region of the ME network, the
   primary motor cortex (M1), has been consistently linked to motor
   performance. However, the activation of M1 during motor imagery is
   controversial, which may account for inconsistent rehabilitation therapy
   outcomes using MI. Here, we examined the relationship between
   contralateral M1 (cM1) activation during MI and changes in sensorimotor
   performance. To aid cM1 activity modulation during MI, we used real-time
   fMRI neurofeedback-guided MI based on cM1 hand area blood oxygen level
   dependent (BOLD) signal in healthy subjects, performing kinesthetic MI
   of pinching. We used multiple regression analysis to examine the
   correlation between cM1 BOLD signal and changes in motor performance
   during an isometric pinching task of those subjects who were able to
   activate cM1 during motor imagery. Activities in premotor and parietal
   regions were used as covariates. We found that cM1 activity was
   positively correlated to improvements in accuracy as well as overall
   performance improvements, whereas other regions in the sensorimotor
   network were not. The association between cM1 activation during MI with
   performance changes indicates that subjects with stronger cM1 activation
   during MI may benefit more from MI training, with implications toward
   targeted neurotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Transport due to spin-helical massless Dirac fermion surface state is of
   paramount importance to realize various new physical phenomena in
   topological insulators, ranging from quantum anomalous Hall effect to
   Majorana fermions. However, one of the most important hallmarks of
   topological surface states, the Dirac linear band dispersion, has been
   difficult to reveal directly in transport measurements. Here we report
   experiments on Bi2Te3 nanoribbon ambipolar field effect devices on
   high-kappa SrTiO3 substrates, where we achieve a gate-tuned bulk
   metal-insulator transition and the topological transport regime with
   substantial surface state conduction. In this regime, we report two
   unambiguous transport evidences for gate-tunable Dirac fermions through
   p Berry's phase in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and effective mass
   proportional to the Fermi momentum, indicating linear energy-momentum
   dispersion. We also measure a gate-tunable weak anti-localization (WAL)
   with 2 coherent conduction channels (indicating 2 decoupled surfaces)
   near the charge neutrality point, and a transition to weak localization
   (indicating a collapse of the Berry's phase) when the Fermi energy
   approaches the bulk conduction band. The gate-tunable Dirac fermion
   topological surface states pave the way towards a variety of topological
   electronic devices.}},

   derivatives displaying aldehydes were non-toxic towards primary Schwann
   cells. The PEG and HA derivatives form oxime crosslinked hydrogels with
   mechanical and swelling properties that were tunable based on the
   composition of the hydrogels to values analogous to soft tissues such as
   those found in the central or peripheral nervous system. Gels
   incorporating collagen-1 supported the adhesion of human mesenchymal
   stem cells. Such chemistry has the potential to generate clinically
   relevant injectable hydrogels for minimally invasive personalized
   medical procedures in the central or peripheral nervous systems.}},

Abstract = {{The perovskite PbCrO3 is an antiferromagnetic insulator. However, the
   fundamental interactions leading to the insulating state in this
   single-valent perovskite are unclear. Moreover, the origin of the
   unprecedented volume drop observed at a modest pressure of P = 1.6 GPa
   remains an outstanding problem. We report a variety of in situ pressure
   measurements including electron transport properties, X-ray absorption
   spectrum, and crystal structure study by X-ray and neutron diffraction.
   These studies reveal key information leading to the elucidation of the
   physics behind the insulating state and the pressure-induced transition.
   We argue that a charge disproportionation 3Cr(4+) -> 2Cr(3+) + Cr6+ in
   association with the 6s-p hybridization on the Pb2+ is responsible for
   the insulating ground state of PbCrO3 at ambient pressure and the charge
   disproportionation phase is suppressed under pressure to give rise to a
   metallic phase at high pressure. The model is well supported by density
   function theory plus the correlation energy U (DFT + U) calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The current work explores the crystalline perovskite oxide, strontium
   hafnate, as a potential high-k gate dielectric for Ge-based transistors.
   SrHfO3 (SHO) is grown directly on Ge by atomic layer deposition and
   becomes crystalline with epitaxial registry after post-deposition vacuum
   annealing at similar to 700 degrees C for 5min. The 2 x 1 reconstructed,
   clean Ge (001) surface is a necessary template to achieve crystalline
   films upon annealing. The SHO films exhibit excellent crystallinity, as
   shown by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The SHO
   films have favorable electronic properties for consideration as a high-k
   gate dielectric on Ge, with satisfactory band offsets (> 2 eV), low
   leakage current (< 10(-5) A/cm(2) at an applied field of 1 MV/cm) at an
   equivalent oxide thickness of 1 nm, and a reasonable dielectric constant
   (k similar to 18). The interface trap density (D-it) is estimated to be
   as low as similar to 2 x 10(12) cm(-2) eV(-1) under the current growth
   and anneal conditions. Some interfacial reaction is observed between SHO
   and Ge at temperatures above similar to 650 degrees C, which may
   contribute to increased D-it value. This study confirms the potential
   for crystalline oxides grown directly on Ge by atomic layer deposition
   for advanced electronic applications. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) is a multifunctional virulence factor
   secreted by Bordetella species. Upon interaction of its C-terminal
   hemolysin moiety with the cell surface receptor alpha(M)beta(2)
   integrin, the N-terminal cyclase domain translocates into the host cell
   cytosol where it rapidly generates supraphysiological cAMP
   concentrations, which inhibit host cell anti-bacterial activities.
   Although ACT has been shown to induce protective immunity in mice, it is
   not included in any current acellular pertussis vaccines due to protein
   stability issues and a poor understanding of its role as a protective
   antigen. Here, we aimed to determine whether any single domain could
   recapitulate the antibody responses induced by the holo-toxin and to
   characterize the dominant neutralizing antibody response. We first
   immunized mice with ACT and screened antibody phage display libraries
   for binding to purified ACT. The vast majority of unique antibodies
   identified bound the C-terminal repeat-in-toxin (RTX) domain.
   Representative antibodies binding two nonoverlapping, neutralizing
   epitopes in the RTX domain prevented ACT association with J774A.1
   macrophages and soluble alpha(M)beta(2) integrin, suggesting that these
   antibodies inhibit the ACT-receptor interaction. Sera from mice
   immunized with the RTX domain showed similar neutralizing activity as
   ACT-immunized mice, indicating that this domain induced an antibody
   response similar to that induced by ACT. These data demonstrate that RTX
   can elicit neutralizing antibodies and suggest it may present an
   alternative to ACT.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Based on Mie scattering theory, we derive the complete dynamic
   polarizability tensor for circular, azimuthally symmetric cylinders
   excited by an arbitrary field distribution, and provide compact
   expressions for all of its elements. Our results comprise fully dynamic
   cylinder polarizabilities, improving existing approximate models that
   use averaged electric ormagnetic current lines to describe the
   scattering response of moderately thin cylinders. We show that the
   derived polarizability tensor satisfies reciprocity and passivity
   relations, and analyze its response under different conditions, varying
   the excitation angle, material properties, and cylinder radius.
   Interestingly, magnetoelectric effects are shown to arise at oblique
   incidence, even in the case of centrosymmetric achiral thin cylinders,
   associated with a weak form of spatial dispersion. This finding is
   particularly relevant for the proper modeling of individual cylinders
   and arrays of them, as in the case of metamaterials. We expect this work
   to find applications in antenna and metamaterial design, and to improve
   the physical understanding of the wave interaction and spatial
   dispersion in artificial materials composed of elongated inclusions such
   as wire media. pm}},

Abstract = {{The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance of various
   forms of lithium cobalt oxide has been studied to systematically
   establish the surface-level catalytic mechanism. The low-temperature
   lithiated spinel form of LiCoO2 (designated as LT-LiCoO2) exhibits lower
   overpotentials than the high-temperature layered form of LiCoO2
   (designated as HT-LiCoO2), but this is shown to be a result of the
   increased surface area afforded by lower-temperature synthesis
   conditions. Raman spectroscopy, along with the presence of an
   irreversible peak during the first cycle of the oxygen evolution
   reaction (OER), demonstrates that the mechanism for OER is the same for
   both the forms of LiCoO2. At the surface level, lithium is removed
   during the first cycle of the OER, forming Co3O4 on the surface, which
   is likely the active site during the OER. This work highlights the
   importance of determining the nature of the catalyst surface when
   investigating the electrocatalytic properties of bulk materials.}},

Abstract = {{Electrons, optical phonons, and acoustic phonons are often driven out of
   local equilibrium in electronic devices or during laser-material
   interaction processes. The need for a better understanding of such
   non-equilibrium transport processes has motivated the development of
   Raman spectroscopy as a local temperature sensor of optical phonons and
   intermediate frequency acoustic phonons, whereas Brillouin light
   scattering (BLS) has recently been explored as a temperature sensor of
   low-frequency acoustic phonons. Here, we report the measured BLS spectra
   of silicon at different temperatures. The origins of the observed
   temperature dependence of the BLS peak position, linewidth, and
   intensity are examined in order to evaluate their potential use as
   temperature sensors for acoustic phonons. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretation of hydrocarbon-bearing shale is subject to great
   uncertainty because of pervasive heterogeneity, thin beds, and
   incomplete and uncertain knowledge of saturation-porosity-resistivity
   models. We developed a stochastic joint-inversion method specifically
   developed to address the quantitative petrophysical interpretation of
   hydrocarbon-bearing shale. The method was based on the rapid and
   interactive numerical simulation of resistivity and nuclear logs.
   Instead of property values themselves, the estimation method delivered
   the a posteriori probability of each property. The Markov-chain Monte
   Carlo algorithm was used to sample the model space to quantify the a
   posteriori distribution of formation properties. Additionally, the new
   interpretation method allows the use of fit-for-purpose statistical
   correlations between water saturation, salt concentration, porosity, and
   electrical resistivity to implement uncertain, non-Archie resistivity
   models derived from core data, including those affected by total organic
   carbon (TOC). In the case of underdetermined estimation problems, i.e.,
   when the number of measurements was lower than the number of unknowns,
   the use of a priori information enabled plausible results within
   prespecified petrophysical and compositional bounds. The developed
   stochastic interpretation technique was successfully verified with data
   acquired in the Barnett and Haynesville Shales. Core data (including
   X-ray diffraction data) were combined into a priori information for
   interpretation of nuclear and resistivity logs. Results consisted of
   mineral concentrations, TOC, and porosity together with their
   uncertainty. Eighty percent of the core data was located within the 95\%
   credible interval of estimated mineral/fluid concentrations.}},

Title = {{Murine Model of Femoral Artery Wire Injury with Implantation of a
   Perivascular Drug Delivery Patch}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{96}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Percutaneous interventions including balloon angioplasty and stenting
   have been used to restore blood flow in vessels with occlusive vascular
   disease. While these therapies lead to the rapid restoration of blood
   flow, these technologies remain limited by restenosis in the case of
   bare metal stents and angioplasty, or reduced healing and possibly
   enhanced risk of thrombosis in the case of drug eluting stents. A key
   pathophysiological mechanism in the formation of restenosis is intimal
   hyperplasia caused by the activation of vascular smooth muscle cells and
   inflammation due to arterial stretch and injury. Surgeries that induce
   arterial injury in genetically modified mice are useful for the
   mechanistic study of the vascular response to injury but are often
   technically challenging to perform in mouse models due to the their
   small size and lack of appropriate sized devices. We describe two
   approaches for a surgical technique that induces endothelial denudation
   and arterial stretch in the femoral artery of mice to produce robust
   neointimal hyperplasia. The first approach creates an arteriotomy in the
   muscular branch of the femoral artery to obtain vascular access.
   Following wire injury this arterial branch is ligated to close the
   arteriotomy. A second approach creates an arteriotomy in the main
   femoral artery that is later closed through localized cautery. This
   method allows for vascular access through a larger vessel and,
   consequently, provides a less technically demanding procedure that can
   be used in smaller mice. Following either method of arterial injury, a
   degradable drug delivery patch can be placed over or around the injured
   artery to deliver therapeutic agents.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of cancer using nanoparticle-based approaches relies on the
   rational design of carriers with respect to size, charge, and surface
   properties. Polymer-based nanomaterials, inorganic materials such as
   gold, iron oxide, and silica as well as carbon based materials such as
   carbon nanotubes and graphene are being explored extensively for cancer
   therapy. The challenges associated with the delivery of these
   nanoparticles depend greatly on the type of cancer and stage of
   development. This review highlights design considerations to develop
   nanoparticle-based approaches for overcoming physiological hurdles in
   cancer treatment, as well as emerging research in engineering advanced
   delivery systems for the treatment of primary, metastatic, and multidrug
   resistant cancers. A growing understanding of cancer biology will
   continue to foster development of intelligent nanoparticle-based
   therapeutics that take into account diverse physiological contexts of

Abstract = {{We discuss an optimization methodology for focusing wave energy to
   subterranean formations using strong motion actuators placed on the
   ground surface. The motivation stems from the desire to increase the
   mobility of otherwise entrapped oil. The goal is to arrive at the
   spatial and temporal description of surface sources that are capable of
   maximizing mobility in the target reservoir. The focusing problem is
   posed as an inverse source problem. The underlying wave propagation
   problems are abstracted in two spatial dimensions, and the semi-infinite
   extent of the physical domain is negotiated by a buffer of
   perfectly-matched-layers (PMLs) placed at the domain's truncation
   boundary. We discuss two possible numerical implementations: Their
   utility for deciding the tempo-spatial characteristics of optimal wave
   sources is shown via numerical experiments. Overall, the simulations
   demonstrate the inverse source method's ability to simultaneously
   optimize load locations and time signals leading to the maximization of
   energy delivery to a target formation.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To evaluate the capability of a novel, coaligned focused
   ultrasound and phase-sensitive optical coherence elastography (US-OCE)
   system to assess age-related changes in biomechanical properties of the
   crystalline lens in situ.
   METHODS. Low-amplitude elastic deformations in young and mature rabbit
   lenses were measured by an US-OCE system consisting of a spectral-domain
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) system coaligned with a focused
   ultrasound system used to produce a transient force on the lens surface.
   Uniaxial compressional tests were used to validate the OCE data.
   RESULTS. The OCE measurements showed that the maximum displacements of
   the young rabbit lenses were significantly larger than those of the
   mature lenses, indicating a gradual increase of the lens stiffness with
   age. Temporal analyses of the displacements also demonstrate a similar
   trend of elastic properties in these lenses. The stress-strain
   measurements using uniaxial mechanical tests confirmed the results
   obtained by the USOCE system.
   CONCLUSIONS. The results demonstrate that the US-OCE system can be used
   for noninvasive analysis and quantification of lens biomechanical
   properties in situ and possibly in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) are predicted to increase in market share as
   auto manufacturers introduce more fuel efficient vehicles to meet
   stricter fuel economy mandates and fossil fuel costs remain
   unpredictable. Reflecting spatial autocorrelation while controlling for
   a variety of demographic and locational (e.g., built environment)
   attributes, the zone-level spatial count model in this paper offers
   valuable information for power providers and charging station location
   decisions. By anticipating over 745,000 personal-vehicle registrations
   across a sample of 1000 census block groups in the Philadelphia region,
   a trivariate Poisson-lognormal conditional autoregressive (CAR) model
   anticipates Prius hybrid EV, other EV, and conventional vehicle
   ownership levels. Initial results signal higher EV ownership rates in
   more central zones with higher household incomes, along with significant
   residual spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that spatially-correlated
   latent variables and/or peer (neighbor) effects on purchase decisions
   are present. Such data sets will become more comprehensive and
   informative as EV market shares rise. This work's multivariate
   Poisson-lognormal CAR modeling approach offers a rigorous,
   behaviorally-defensible framework for spatial patterns in choice
   behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the damage imposed by
   the movement of wind turbine components on Texas's highway
   infrastructure. The damage to the pavement structure was estimated using
   three primary distress mechanisms - rutting, longitudinal and alligator
   cracking - and also roughness. The extent of the damage to the pavement
   structure was evaluated using the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design
   Guide (MEPDG). The methodology adopted involved calculating the pavement
   distress due to the combined effect of the wind turbine and the design
   traffic relative to that due to the design traffic only. This ensures
   that biases in the distress predictions obtained from the MEPDG will
   mutually cancel each other out in each of the two scenarios. It was
   observed that the pavement damage in the case of Interstate and US
   highway sections was roughly 0.3\% and 4\% higher, respectively,
   irrespective of the distress mechanism. However, the pavement damage due
   to wind turbine truck traffic on state highways had a more serious
   impact than in the higher functional classes. The additional damage
   imposed by the wind turbine truck traffic will translate into a
   reduction in pavement service life that is estimated at 9\%.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility-control methods have the potential to improve coupled enhanced
   oil recovery (EOR) and carbon dioxide (CO2) storage technique (CO2-EOR).
   There is a need for improved three-phase relative permeability models
   with hysteresis, especially including the effects of cycle dependency so
   that more-accurate predictions of these methods can be made. We propose
   new three-phase relative permeability and three-phase hysteresis models
   applicable to different fluid configurations in a porous medium under
   different wettability conditions. The relative permeability model
   includes both the saturation history and compositional effects.
   Three-phase parameters are estimated on the basis of saturation-weighted
   interpolation of two-phase parameters. The hysteresis model is an
   extension of the Land trapping model (Land 1968) but with a dynamic Land
   coefficient introduced. The trapping model estimates a constantly
   increasing trapped saturation for intermediate-wetting and nonwetting
   phases. The hysteresis model overcomes some of the limitations of
   existing three-phase hysteresis models for nonwater-wet rocks and
   mitigates the complexity associated with commonly applied models in
   numerical simulators. The relative permeability model is validated by
   use of multicyclic three-phase water-alternating-gas experimental data
   for nonwater-wet rocks. Numerical simulations of a carbonate reservoir
   with and without hysteresis were used to assess the effect of the
   saturation direction and saturation path on gas entrapment and oil
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-aided gravity drainage is a common oil-recovery technique in
   anticline-shaped oil reservoirs. If the permeability is low and the
   reservoir is oil-wet, the remaining oil saturation can be quite high.
   The goal of this work is to mobilize a part of this oil by surfactant
   injection. An anionic-surfactant formulation was developed to alter
   wettability and lower interfacial tension (IFT) for a gasflooded,
   carbonate reservoir. Different coreflood strategies, including
   gas/water/surfactant/water (GWSW), gas/surfactant/gas (GSG),
   gas/surfactant/water (GSW), and gas/surfactant/water/gas (GSWG) floods,
   were investigated. GSG, GWSW, and GSWG corefloods conducted in limestone
   cores recovered an additional 40-50\% of the original oil in place
   (OOIP) because of the injection of surfactant. GSW corefloods conducted
   in a vuggy dolomite recovered less: an approximately 20\%-of-OOIP
   incremental recovery. Numerical simulation was used to match GSG and GSW
   corefloods and estimate multiphase-flow functions. A 2D conceptual
   simulation model using these functions was built for an anticline
   reservoir for gas and surfactant-solution injection. GSG flooding using
   wettability-altering surfactant exhibited high oil recovery at the field
   scale. IFT reduction, wettability alteration, and foam formation
   contributed to enhanced oil recovery (EOR).}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A space-time physical-layer network coding (ST-PNC) method is presented
   for information exchange among multiple users over fully connected
   multiway relay networks. The method involves two steps: 1)
   side-information learning and 2) space-time relay transmission. In the
   first step, different sets of users are scheduled to send signals over
   networks, and the remaining users and relays overhear the transmitted
   signals, thereby learning the interference patterns. In the second step,
   multiple relays cooperatively send out linear combinations of signals
   received in the previous phase using space-time precoding so that all
   users efficiently exploit their side information in the form of 1) what
   they sent and 2) what they overheard in decoding. This coding concept is
   illustrated through two simple network examples. It is shown that ST-PNC
   improves the sum of degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) of the network compared
   to existing interference management methods. With ST-PNC, the sum-DoF of
   a general multiway relay network without channel knowledge at the users
   is characterized in terms of relevant system parameters, chiefly the
   number of users, the number of relays, and the number of antennas at
   relays. A major implication of the derived results is that efficiently
   harnessing both transmitted and overheard signals as side information
   brings significant performance improvements to fully connected multiway
   relay networks.}},

Abstract = {{Methane hydrate formation and dissociation are buffered by salinity in a
   closed system. During hydrate formation, salt excluded from hydrate
   increases salinity, drives the system to three-phase (gas, water, and
   hydrate phases) equilibrium, and limits further hydrate formation and
   dissociation. We developed a zero-dimensional local thermodynamic
   equilibrium-based model to explain this concept. We demonstrated this
   concept by forming and melting methane hydrate from a partially
   brine-saturated sand sample in a controlled laboratory experiment by
   holding pressure constant (6.94MPa) and changing temperature stepwise.
   The modeled methane gas consumptions and hydrate saturations agreed well
   with the experimental measurements after hydrate nucleation. Hydrate
   dissociation occurred synchronously with temperature increase. The
   exception to this behavior is that substantial subcooling (6.4 degrees C
   in this study) was observed for hydrate nucleation. X-ray computed
   tomography scanning images showed that core-scale hydrate distribution
   was heterogeneous. This implied core-scale water and salt transport
   induced by hydrate formation. Bulk resistivity increased sharply with
   initial hydrate formation and then decreased as the hydrate ripened.
   This study reproduced the salinity-buffered hydrate behavior interpreted
   for natural gas-rich hydrate systems by allowing methane gas to freely
   enter/leave the sample in response to volume changes associated with
   hydrate formation and dissociation. It provides insights into
   observations made at the core scale and log scale of salinity elevation
   to three-phase equilibrium in natural hydrate systems.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the use of silica nanoparticle-stabilized emulsions to
   displace oil in porous media. A low-quality (20\%) n-decane-in-water
   emulsion was injected into a glass-bead pack containing mineral oil
   under residual oil saturation conditions. Continuous injection of the
   emulsion caused steady trapping and accumulation of emulsion droplets,
   which occurred despite the fact that the bead sizes were 250-500 mu m,
   whereas the average droplet size was similar to 30 mu m, as indicated by
   particle size analysis. By alternately injecting small banks of emulsion
   (0.1 pore volume (PV)) and water (0.23-0.1 PV), the extent of emulsion
   droplet trapping could be controlled while achieving oil recovery.
   The effects of salt addition and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/nanoparticle
   concentration were also investigated in terms of emulsion stability and
   oil recovery. The salt addition (1 wt\%) more efficiently stabilized the
   droplets without significant coalescence and contributed to
   approximately 4\% more oil recovery than achieved in the absence of an
   emulsion system. The PVA/nanoparticle concentration indicated that the
   emulsion with a low concentration (0.05 wt\%) of PVA and a high
   concentration (3 wt\%) of nanoparticles had greater stability and
   enhanced oil recovery compared with the opposite (a high concentration
   (0.2 wt\%) of PVA and low concentration (1 wt\%) of nanoparticles).
   These results indicated that the addition of salt and PVA/nanoparticle
   concentration influenced oil recovery and emulsion stability. Oil
   recovery was related to emulsion stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Batch pyrolysis of a commercial resole type phenol-formaldehyde resin
   was performed using a step-wise heating procedure in a temperature
   increment of 50 K from 320 to 1290 K. A resin sample of 50 mg was loaded
   in a reactor assembly specifically designed and built for this study.
   Mass loss was measured after each 50 K step and the production of
   pyrolysis products was quantified using gas chromatography techniques.
   The overall mass loss from the samples reached 39.2\% after the entire
   procedure. Three major product families were identified: 1) water is the
   most dominant product at a pyrolysis temperature below 800 K; 2) phenol
   derivatives (aromatic alcohols) have significant yields at a pyrolysis
   temperature between 500 and 850 K; 3) permanent gases such as hydrogen,
   methane, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide have the highest yields at
   a temperature above 800 K. Minor products observed include aromatics,
   which are formed between 700 and 850 K, and C-2 to C-4 light
   hydrocarbons, which are only formed above 800 K and peak at 1000 K. (C)

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{61-70}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{To better understand the observed performance of demand-side approaches
   on residential electricity use, we develop and apply a mixed regression
   model of electricity consumption that includes marginal, joint technical
   change for multiple residential electricity end-uses (air conditioning,
   appliances, devices, and electric vehicles). Results indicate that the
   relative technical state of a home can significantly influence the
   performance of demand-side interventions, particularly the presence of a
   programmable thermostat. Within air conditioning, we generally find that
   ``enough{''} consistent technical improvement is needed to realize
   energy savings, which could be due to engineering building performance
   or a declining marginal rebound effect as householders become thermally
   comfortable. Results indicate that homeowners do not leverage efficiency
   gains for appliance services but demonstrate mixed results when
   considering the expansion of electricity services. Householders may
   rebound into device loads, albeit such results are not statistically
   significant. However, results indicate that householders do not leverage
   efficiency gains for electric vehicles. These results demonstrate that
   the net effect of technological change in households is relative to a
   home's baseline technical efficiency and the degree to which homeowners
   seek new and existing energy services, challenging empirical assessments
   that do not control for the technical state of multiple end uses. (C)

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{467-479}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant-stabilized foams have been used in the past for vertical
   conformance and mobility control in gas-enhanced oil recovery processes.
   Lack of stability of these foams often limits their application. The
   goal of this study is to investigate the synergistic effects of using a
   blend of silica nanoparticles (NPs) and anionic surfactants on foam
   stability in both bulk and porous media. First, the stability of static
   foams was studied using surfactants and surfactant-NP mixtures with and
   without the presence of a crude oil. Second, the foam drainage behavior
   and thickness of the foam lamella were studied by fluorescence
   microscopy. Third, the mobility of foams was measured by coinjecting the
   surfactant or surfactant-NP solution with nitrogen gas through a Berea
   sandstone core at a fixed foam quality (gas volume fraction). Finally,
   oil displacement experiments were conducted in Berea cores using these
   foams. Static foam tests indicated a stabilization effect of
   nanoparticles on surfactant-NP-stabilized foams in the absence of crude
   oil. Adding nanoparticles at low concentrations (0.3 wt \%) improves the
   foam stability and increases the mobility reduction factor by a factor
   of 2 in the absence of oil. Fluorescence and confocal laser scanning
   microscopy elucidated the trapping of nanoparticles in Plateau borders
   as well as lamellas, which retards liquid drainage and bubble
   coalescence. Core floods with a reservoir crude oil showed about 10\%
   incremental oil recovery by an immiscible foam (with the surfactant-NP
   blend) over a water flood. This study shows that nanoparticles have the
   potential to increase the stability of surfactant-stabilized foams in
   subsurface applications.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular network performance can significantly benefit from direct
   device-to-device (D2D) communication, but interference from cochannel
   D2D communication limits the performance gain. In hybrid networks
   consisting of D2D and cellular links, finding the optimal interference
   management is challenging. In particular, we show that the problem of
   maximizing network throughput while guaranteeing predefined service
   levels to cellular users is non-convex and hence intractable. Instead,
   we adopt a distributed approach that is computationally extremely
   efficient, and requires minimal coordination, communication and
   cooperation among the nodes. The key algorithmic idea is a signaling
   mechanism that can be seen as a fictional pricing mechanism, that the
   base stations optimize and transmit to the D2D users, who then play a
   best response (i.e., selfishly) to this signal. Numerical results show
   that our algorithms converge quickly, have low overhead, and achieve a
   significant throughput gain, while maintaining the quality of cellular
   links at a predefined service level.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the use of a modified Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equation in

   the viscoelastic properties of the cornea. Phase velocities of
   air-pulse-induced elastic waves were extracted by spectral analysis and
   used for calculating the Young's moduli of the samples using the
   Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equation (RLFE). Validation experiments were
   performed on 2\% agar phantoms (n = 3) and then applied to porcine
   corneas (n = 3) in situ. The Young's moduli of the porcine corneas were
   estimated to be similar to 60 kPa with a shear viscosity similar to 0.33
   Pa . s. The results demonstrate that the RLFE is a promising method for
   noninvasive quantification of the corneal biomechanical properties and
   may potentially be useful for clinical ophthalmological applications.

Abstract = {{Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) can be used to noninvasively
   measure skin properties. To extract skin properties from DRS spectra,
   you need a model that relates the reflectance to the tissue properties.
   Most models are based on the assumption that skin is homogenous. In
   reality, skin is composed of multiple layers, and the homogeneity
   assumption can lead to errors. In this study, we analyze the errors
   caused by the homogeneity assumption. This is accomplished by creating
   realistic skin spectra using a computational model, then extracting
   properties from those spectra using a one-layer model. The extracted
   parameters are then compared to the parameters used to create the
   modeled spectra. We used a wavelength range of 400 to 750 nm and a
   source detector separation of 250 mu m. Our results show that use of a
   one-layer skin model causes underestimation of hemoglobin concentration
   {[}Hb] and melanin concentration {[}mel]. Additionally, the magnitude of
   the error is dependent on epidermal thickness. The one-layer assumption
   also causes {[}Hb] and {[}mel] to be correlated. Oxygen saturation is
   overestimated when it is below 50\% and underestimated when it is above
   50\%. We also found that the vessel radius factor used to account for
   pigment packaging is correlated with epidermal thickness. (C) The

Abstract = {{We present, for the first time, scalable polarizable molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulations within a polarizable continuum solvent with molecular
   shape cavities and exact solution of the mutual polarization. The key
   ingredients are a very efficient algorithm for solving the equations
   associated with the polarizable continuum, in particular, the domain
   decomposition Conductor-like Screening Model (ddCOSMO), which involves a
   rigorous coupling of the continuum with the polarizable force field
   achieved through a robust variational formulation and an effective
   strategy to solve the coupled equations. The coupling of ddCOSMO with
   nonvariational force fields, including AMOEBA, is also addressed. The MD
   simulations are feasible, for real-life systems, on standard cluster
   nodes; a scalable parallel implementation allows for further
   acceleration in the context of a newly developed module in Tinker, named
   Tinker-HP. NVE simulations are stable, and long-term energy conservation
   can be achieved. This paper is focused on the methodological
   developments, the analysis of the algorithm, and the stability of the
   simulations; a proof-of-concept application is also presented to attest
   to the possibilities of this newly developed technique.}},

Abstract = {{It is believed that the optimal morphology of an organic solar cell may
   be characterized by cocontinuous, interpenetrating donor and acceptor
   domains with nanoscale dimensions and high interfacial areas. One
   well-known equilibrium morphology that fits these characteristics is the
   bicontinuous microemulsion achieved by the addition of block copolymer
   compatibilizers to flexible polymer polymer blends. However, there does
   not exist design rules for using block copolymer compatibilizers to
   produce bicontinuous microemulsion morphologies from the conjugated
   polymer/fullerene mixtures typically used to form the active layer of
   organic solar cells. Motivated by these considerations, we use single
   chain in mean field simulations to study the equilibrium phase behavior
   of semiflexible polymer + flexible-semiflexible block copolymer +
   solvent mixtures. Based on our results, we identify design rules for
   producing large channels of morphologies with characteristics like that
   of the bicontinuous microemulsion.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene has emerged as a promising optoelectronic material because its
   optical properties can be rapidly and dramatically changed using
   electric gating Graphene's weak optical response especially in the
   infrared part of the spectrum, remains the key challenge to developing
   practical graphene-based optical devices such as modulators, infrared
   detectors, and tunable reflect-arrays Here it is experimentally and
   theoretically demonstrated that a plasmonic metasurface with two Fano
   resonances can dramatically enhance the interaction of infrared light
   with single layer graphene: Graphene's plasmonic response in the Pauli
   blocking regime is shown to cause strong spectral shifts of the Fano
   resonances without inducing additional nonradiative losses. It is shown
   that such electrically controllable spectral shift, combined with the
   narrow spectral width of the metasurface's Fano resonances, enables
   reflectivity modulation by nearly an order of magnitude. We also
   demonstrate that metasurface-based enhancement of the interaction
   between graphene and infrared light can be utilized to extract one of
   the key optical parameters of graphene: the free carrier scattering
   rate. Numerical simulations demonstrate the,possibility of strong active
   modulation of the phase of the reflected light while keeping the
   reflectivity nearly constant, thereby paving the way to tunable infrared
   lenses and beam steering devices based on electrically controlled
   graphene integrated with resonant metasurfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Isogeometric collocation methods have been proposed recently and their
   accuracy and efficiency demonstrated for elastostatics and explicit
   dynamics. This paper addresses two important aspects in the development
   of the isogeometric collocation technology, namely, the imposition of
   Neumann boundary conditions and the enforcement of contact constraints,
   which are both treated within the same framework. It is shown that the
   strong imposition of Neumann boundary conditions may lead to a
   significant loss of accuracy in some situations, in particular when
   non-uniform meshes are used. Two possible remedies are proposed to
   restore the desired level of accuracy while keeping the computational
   cost virtually unchanged, i.e. a hybrid collocation-Galerkin approach
   and an enhanced collocation (EC) approach. A frictionless contact
   formulation suitable for the collocation framework is further proposed
   and shown to pass the contact patch test to machine precision. When
   combined with the EC approach, the formulation is shown to deliver
   accurate results and to perform robustly also for highly non-uniform
   meshes. For all the collocation formulations, contact pressures are
   greater than or equal to zero pointwise, in contrast with standard
   Lagrange finite elements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Phase-field models based on the variational formulation for brittle
   fracture have recently been shown capable of accurately and robustly
   predicting complex crack behavior. Their numerical implementation
   requires costly operations at the quadrature point level, which may
   include finding eigenvalues and forming tensor projection operators. We
   explore the application of isogeometric collocation methods for the
   discretization of second-order and fourth-order phase-field fracture
   models. We show that a switch from isogeometric Galerkin to isogeometric
   collocation methods has the potential to significantly speed up
   phase-field fracture computations due to a reduction of point
   evaluations. We advocate a hybrid collocation-Galerkin formulation that
   provides a consistent way of weakly enforcing Neumann boundary
   conditions and multi-patch interface constraints, is able to handle the
   multiple boundary integral terms that arise from the weighted residual
   formulation, and offers the flexibility to adaptively improve the crack
   resolution in the fracture zone. We present numerical examples in one
   and two dimensions that illustrate the advantages of our approach. (C)

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to construct selective and reduced integration
   rules for isogeometric analysis based on NURBS elements. The notion of
   an approximation space that approximates the target space is introduced.
   We explore the use of various approximation spaces associated with
   optimal patch-wise numerical quadratures that exactly integrate the
   polynomials in approximation spaces with the minimum number of
   quadrature points. Patch rules exploit the higher continuity of spline
   basis functions. The tendency of smooth spline functions to exhibit
   numerical locking in nearly-incompressible problems when using a full
   Gauss-Legendre quadrature is alleviated with selective or reduced
   integration. Stability and accuracy of the schemes are examined
   analyzing the discrete spectrum in a generalized eigenvalue problem. We
   propose a local algorithm, which is robust and computationally
   efficient, to compute element-by-element the quadrature points and
   weights in patch rules. The performance of the methods is assessed on
   several numerical examples in two-dimensional elasticity and
   Reissner-Mindlin shell structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Title = {{An immersogeometric variational framework for fluid-structure
   interaction: Application to bioprosthetic heart valves}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a geometrically flexible technique for
   computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The motivating
   application is the simulation of tri-leaflet bioprosthetic heart valve
   function over the complete cardiac cycle. Due to the complex motion of
   the heart valve leaflets, the fluid domain undergoes large deformations,
   including changes of topology. The proposed method directly analyzes a
   spline-based surface representation of the structure by immersing it
   into a non-boundary-fitted discretization of the surrounding fluid
   domain. This places our method within an emerging class of computational
   techniques that aim to capture geometry on non-boundary-fitted analysis
   meshes. We introduce the term ``immersogeometric analysis{''} to
   identify this paradigm.
   The framework starts with an augmented Lagrangian formulation for FSI
   that enforces kinematic constraints with a combination of Lagrange
   multipliers and penalty forces. For immersed volumetric objects, we
   formally eliminate the multiplier field by substituting a
   fluid-structure interface traction, arriving at Nitsche's method for
   enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions on object surfaces. For immersed
   thin shell structures modeled geometrically as surfaces, the tractions
   from opposite sides cancel due to the continuity of the background fluid
   solution space, leaving a penalty method. Application to a bioprosthetic
   heart valve, where there is a large pressure jump across the leaflets,
   reveals shortcomings of the penalty approach. To counteract steep
   pressure gradients through the structure without the conditioning
   problems that accompany strong penalty forces, we resurrect the Lagrange
   multiplier field. Further, since the fluid discretization is not
   tailored to the structure geometry, there is a significant error in the
   approximation of pressure discontinuities across the shell. This error
   becomes especially troublesome in residual-based stabilized methods for
   incompressible flow, leading to problematic compressibility at practical
   levels of refinement. We modify existing stabilized methods to improve
   performance.
   To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methods, we test them on
   benchmark problems and compare the results with those of established
   boundary-fitted techniques. Finally, we simulate the coupling of the
   bioprosthetic heart valve and the surrounding blood flow under
   physiological conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
   proposed techniques in practical computations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Concentrated piperazine (PZ) is a promising new solvent under
   consideration for post-combustion capture (PCC) of CO2. A solution of 8
   molal PZ was recently evaluated at the Tarong CO2 capture pilot plant in
   Australia. Initial operation involved evaluation of different operating
   conditions at the plant to determine the minimum energy conditions for
   this solvent. Comparison was made to results achieved previously at the
   same pilot plant with 30 wt\% monoethanolamine (MEA). Regeneration
   energy requirements achieved with concentrated PZ were consistently
   lower than those achieved with MEA. The lowest regeneration energy for
   PZ at the pilot plant (2.9 MJ/kgCO(2)) was roughly 15\% lower than the
   best result predicted for MEA. Inter-cooling located at the center of
   the absorber column was also evaluated for the concentrated PZ solvent.
   The benefit of inter-cooling was found to depend on the operating
   conditions of the plant, with operation at higher liquid-to-gas (L/G)
   ratios showing a more pronounced effect. For an L/G ratio of 3.3 kg/kg,
   inter-cooling was found to lower the regeneration energy required for PZ
   by approximately 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation detectors provide deterrence and defense against nuclear
   smuggling attempts by scanning vehicles, ships, and pedestrians for
   radioactive material. Understanding detector performance is crucial to
   developing novel technologies, architectures, and alarm algorithms.
   Detection can be modeled through radiation transport simulations;
   however, modeling a spanning set of threat scenarios over the full
   transport phase-space is computationally challenging. Previous research
   has demonstrated Green's functions can simulate photon detector signals
   by decomposing the scenario space into independently simulated
   submodels. This paper presents decomposition methods for neutron and
   time-dependent transport. As a result, neutron detector signals produced
   from full forward transport simulations can be efficiently reconstructed
   by sequential application of submodel response functions.}},

Abstract = {{We report thermoelectric transport measurements across a
   graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/graphene heterostructure device.
   Using an AC lock-in technique, we are able to separate the
   thermoelectric contribution to the I-V characteristics of these
   important device structures. The temperature gradient is measured
   optically using Raman spectroscopy, which enables us to explore
   thermoelectric transport produced at material interfaces, across length
   scales of just 1-2 nm. Based on the observed thermoelectric voltage
   (Delta V) and temperature gradient (Delta T), a Seebeck coefficient of
   -99.3 mu V/K is ascertained for the heterostructure device. The obtained
   Seebeck coefficient can be useful for understanding the thermoelectric
   component in the cross-plane I-V behaviors of emerging 2D
   heterostructure devices. These results provide an approach to probing
   thermoelectric energy conversion in two-dimensional layered
   heterostructures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings from a study aimed at examining the
   effectiveness of shoulder rumble strips in reducing run-off-the-road
   (ROR) crashes on two-lane rural highways using the empirical Bayes (EB)
   before-and-after analysis method. Specifically, the study analyzed the
   effects of traffic volume, roadway geometry and paved right shoulder
   width on the effectiveness of shoulder rumble strips. The results of
   this study demonstrate the safety benefits of shoulder rumble strips in
   reducing the ROR crashes on two-lane rural highways using the state of
   Idaho 2001-2009 crash data. This study revealed a 14\% reduction in all
   ROR crashes after the installation of shoulder rumble strips on 178.63
   miles of two-lane rural highways in Idaho. The results indicate that
   shoulder rumble strips were most effective on roads with relatively
   moderate curvature and right paved shoulder width of 3 feet and more.

Abstract = {{Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs, i.e., crystalline nanoparticles) have
   become an important class of materials with great potential for
   applications ranging from medicine to electronic and optoelectronic
   devices. Todays strong research focus on NCs has been prompted by the
   tremendous progress in their synthesis. Impressively narrow size
   distributions of just a few percent, rational shape-engineering,
   compositional modulation, electronic doping, and tailored surface
   chemistries are now feasible for a broad range of inorganic compounds.
   The performance of inorganic NC-based photovoltaic and light-emitting
   devices has become competitive to other state-of-the-art materials.
   Semiconductor NCs hold unique promise for near- and mid-infrared
   technologies, where very few semiconductor materials are available. On a
   purely fundamental side, new insights into NC growth, chemical
   transformations, and self-organization can be gained from rapidly
   progressing in situ characterization and direct imaging techniques. New
   phenomena are constantly being discovered in the photophysics of NCs and
   in the electronic properties of NC solids. In this Nano Focus, we review
   the state of the art in research on colloidal NCs focusing on the most
   recent works published in the last 2 years.}},

Abstract = {{A very fast, dry transfer process based on Mechanical delamination
   successfully effected the transfer of large-area, (VD grown graphene on
   copper foil to silicon. This has been achieved by bonding silicon
   backing layers to both sides of the graphene-coated copper foil with
   epoxy and applying a suitably high separation rate to the backing
   layers. At the highest separation rate considered (254.0 mu m/s),
   monolayer graphene was completely transferred from the copper foil to
   the target silicon substrate. On the other hand, the lowest rate (25.4
   mu m/s) caused the epoxy to be completely separated from the graphene.
   Fracture mechanics analyses were used to determine the adhesion energy
   between grapheiie and its seed copper foil (6.0 J/m(2)) and between
   graphene and the epoxy (3.4 J/m(2)) at the respective loading rates.
   Control experiments for the epoxy/silicon interface established a rate
   dependent adhesion, which supports the hypothesis that the adhesion of
   the graphene/epoxy interface was higher than that of the graphene/copper
   interface at the higher separation rate, thereby providing a
   controllable mechanism for selective transfer of graphene in future
   nanofabrication systems such as roll-to-roll transfer.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the influences of surface sorption and air flow
   rate on the emission of phthalates from building materials. Controlled
   tests were conducted in specially designed stainless steel and wood
   chambers, and the steady-state concentration in the stainless steel
   chamber was about 2-3 times higher than that in the wood chamber for
   di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DINP). The
   emission rate of phthalates increased in the wood chamber due to the
   diffusion mass flow through the chamber wall (i.e., surface absorption).
   The adsorption isotherm of phthalates on the stainless steel surface and
   the absorption parameters (i.e., diffusion and partition coefficients)
   of phthalates on the wood surface were determined experimentally, and
   the values were comparable to those in the literature. The equilibration
   time scale for phthalates absorbed to the sink reservoir in actual
   indoor environments was estimated and can be substantial (approximately
   80 years), indicating that surface absorption may continuously drive
   phthalates from their indoor sources to various sinks and thus
   significantly increase the emission rate of phthalates. The gas-phase
   concentration of DEHP was measured in two stainless steel chambers
   operated at flow rates of 300 mL/min and 3000 mL/min, respectively,
   which were both adjusted to 1000 mL/min after steady state was reached.
   The gas-phase concentration of DEHP in the chamber was very sensitive to
   the chamber air flow rate, and higher air flow rates resulted in lower
   concentration levels. However, the increased emission rate compensated
   for the dilution in the gas phase and made the DEHP concentration not
   drop substantially with an increase in the air flow rate. Independently
   measured or calculated parameters were used to validate a semivolatile
   organic compounds (SVOCs) emission model that included absorptive
   surfaces and for a range of air flow rates, with excellent agreement
   between the model predictions and the observed chamber concentrations of
   phthalates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an interference alignment method with distributed
   and delayed channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) for a
   class of interference networks. The core idea of the proposed method is
   to align interference signals over time at the unintended receivers in a
   distributed manner. With the proposed method, achievable tradeoffs
   between the sum of degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and feedback delay of
   CSI are characterized in both the X-channel and three-user interference
   channel to reveal the impact on how the CSI feedback delay affects the
   sum-DoF of the interference networks. A major implication of derived
   results is that distributed and moderately delayed CSIT is useful to
   strictly improve the sum-DoF over the case of no CSI at the transmitter
   in a certain class of interference networks. For a class of X-channels,
   the results show how to optimally use distributed and moderately delayed
   CSIT to yield the same sum-DoF as instantaneous and global CSIT.
   Furthermore, leveraging the proposed transmission method and the known
   outer bound results, the sum-capacity of the two-user X-channel with a
   particular set of channel coefficients is characterized within a
   constant number of bits.}},

Abstract = {{We present a scalable solver for approximating the maximum a posteriori
   (MAP) point of Bayesian inverse problems with Besov priors based on
   wavelet expansions with random coefficients. It is a subspace trust
   region interior reflective Newton conjugate gradient method for bound
   constrained optimization problems. The method combines the rapid
   locally-quadratic convergence rate properties of Newton's method, the
   effectiveness of trust region globalization for treating ill-conditioned
   problems, and the Eisenstat-Walker idea of preventing oversolving. We
   demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method on two inverse
   problems: a deconvolution problem and a coefficient inverse problem
   governed by elliptic partial differential equations. The numerical
   results show that the number of Newton iterations is independent of the
   number of wavelet coefficients n and the computation time scales
   linearly in n. It will be numerically shown, under our implementations,
   that the proposed solver is two times faster than the split Bregman
   approach, and it is an order of magnitude less expensive than the
   interior path following primal-dual method. Our results also confirm the
   fact that the Besov B-11(1) prior is sparsity promoting,
   discretization-invariant, and edge-preserving for both imaging and
   inverse problems governed by partial differential equations.}},

Abstract = {{RV Septal Papillary Muscle VT
   IntroductionPremature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and ventricular
   tachycardia (VT) arising from papillary muscles of both ventricles have
   recently been described. There is a lack of data on VT originating from
   the right ventricular papillary (RV PAP) muscles. There have been no
   prior studies focused on the electrocardiogram (ECG) features and
   ablation of PVC/VT arising from the septal papillary muscle of the right
   ventricle.
   MethodsAmong 155 consecutive patients with normal structural heart who
   underwent catheter ablation of PVC/VT, 8 patients with PVC/VT from the
   septal RV PAP muscle were identified. The site of origin of the
   arrhythmias was identified through activation/pace mapping and
   intracardiac echocardiography. All patients underwent radiofrequency
   ablation of the arrhythmia.
   ResultsData on 8 consecutive patients (2 men, age 42 13 years old) were
   collected. All patients had a preserved ejection fraction (60 4\%).
   Septal RV PAP arrhythmias had a left superior axis and negative
   concordance or late R-wave transition in precordial leads. PVCs were
   spontaneous in 5 cases, were induced by isoprotenerol in 2 cases and by
   isoproterenol plus phenylephrine in another one. PVCs were never induced
   with calcium bolus and only rarely with burst pacing. Adenosine never
   terminated VT or suppressed the VT/PVCs. Radiofrequency, fluoroscopic,
   and procedural time were, respectively, 10.3 +/- 3, 36.4 +/- 11.3, and
   76.3 +/- 27.5 minutes. During a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 4 months, mean
   PVC burden was reduced from 14 +/- 3\% preablation to 0.1 +/- 0.2\%
   postablation.
   ConclusionPVCs and VT originating from septal RV papillary muscle could
   have a typical ECG pattern due to the site of the muscle involved.
   Radiofrequency ablation of this anatomic area is feasible and effective.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a scalable, low-cost, and versatile biosensor
   platform for the sensitive and rapid detection of human metabolites is
   of great interest for healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medical science.
   On the basis of hierarchically nanostructured conducting polymer
   hydrogels, we designed a flexible biosensor platform that can detect
   various human metabolites, such as uric acid, cholesterol, and
   triglycerides. Owing to the unique features of conducting polymer
   hydrogels, such as high permeability to biosubstrates and rapid electron
   transfer, our biosensors demonstrate excellent sensing performance with
   a wide linear range (uric acid, 0.07-1 mM; cholesterol, 0.39 mM, and
   triglycerides, 0.25 mM), high sensitivity, low sensing limit, and rapid
   response time (similar to 3 s). Given the facile and scalable
   processability of hydrogels, the proposed conductive hydrogels-based
   biosensor platform shows great promise as a low-cost sensor kit for
   healthcare monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and biomedical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Through the use of Boussinesq scaling we develop and test a model for
   resolving non-hydrostatic pressure profiles in nonlinear wave systems
   over varying bathymetry. A Green-Nagdhi type polynomial expansion is
   used to resolve the pressure profile along the vertical axis, this is
   then inserted into the pressure-Poisson equation, retaining terms up to
   a prescribed order and solved using a weighted residual approach. The
   model shows rapid convergence properties with increasing order of
   polynomial expansion which can be greatly improved through the
   application of asymptotic rearrangement. Models of Boussinesq scaling of
   the fully nonlinear O(mu(2)) and weakly nonlinear O(mu(N)) are
   presented, the analytical and numerical properties of O(mu(2)) and
   O(mu(4)) models are discussed. Optimal basis functions in the
   Green-Nagdhi expansion are determined through manipulation of the
   free-parameters which arise due to the Boussinesq scaling. The optimal
   O(mu(2)) model has dispersion accuracy equivalent to a Pade {[}2,2]
   approximation with one extra free-parameter. The optimal O(mu(4)) model
   obtains dispersion accuracy equivalent to a Pade {[}4,4] approximation
   with two free-parameters which can be used to optimize shoaling or
   nonlinear properties. In comparison to experimental results the O(mu(4))
   model shows excellent agreement to experimental data. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The alloy-coregshell nanoparticle structure combines the advantages of a
   robust noble-metal shell and a tunable alloy-core composition. In this
   study we demonstrate a set of linear correlations between the binding of
   adsorbates to the shell and the alloy-core composition, which are
   general across a range of nanoparticle compositions, size, and adsorbate
   molecules. This systematic tunability allows for a simple approach to
   the design of such catalysts. Calculations of candidate structures for
   the hydrogen evolution reaction predict a high activity for the PtRu@Pd
   structure, in good agreement with what has been reported previously.
   Calculations of alloy-core@Pt 140-atom nanoparticles reveal new
   candidate structures for CO oxidation at high temperature, including
   Au0.65Pd0.35@Pt and Au0.73Pt0.27@Pt, which are predicted to have
   reaction rates 200 times higher than that of Pt(111).}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of layered LiMO2 (M=transition metal) oxides has been
   investigated systematically as a function of composition for the oxygen
   evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. The rich variety of
   LiMO2 compositions with the O3-type layered structure makes this class
   of materials an excellent test-bed for understanding the effects of the
   nature and oxidation states of the transition-metal ions on the OER.
   Accordingly, the OER behaviors of a range of LiMO2 oxide solid solutions
   are presented here: LiCo1-xMnxO2, LiNi1-xMnxO2, and LiCo1-xNixO2 with
   0.25 <= x <= 0.7. It is found that the OER activity increases with
   decreasing Mn content, and the Ni-rich compositions exhibit high OER
   activities. Furthermore, the pre-OER potential region displays
   contributions from surface faradaic reactions that involve Ni and Co.
   The overall higher activity of the Ni- and Co-rich compositions might be
   due to the in situ transformation of the LiMO2 surface into a highly
   active electrocatalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments of high-throughput technologies are enabling the

   Generalizable principles about the molecular composition of the
   protective humoral immune response are being defined, and as such, the
   field could supersede traditional methods for the development of
   diagnostics, vaccines, and antibody therapeutics. Three key challenges
   remain and have driven recent advances: (1) incorporation of innovative
   techniques for paired BCR-seq to ascertain the complete antibody
   variable-domain VH:VL clonotype, (2) integration of proteomic Ig-seq
   with BCR-seq to reveal how the serum antibody repertoire compares with
   the antibody repertoire encoded by circulating B cells, and (3) a demand

Title = {{Comparative analysis of the solution of linear continuous inverse
   problems using different basis expansions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{92-102}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Geophysical inverse problems try to infer the value of a physical
   property of the earth from data measured at the boundary of the domain.
   Model parameterization is a key concept to make the inverse problem less
   ill conditioned. In this contribution we compare the performance of four
   different basis functions, Fourier, Pixel, Haar and Daubechies Wavelets,
   for a 1D linear continuous inverse problem. Adopting the right
   parameterization also reduces the number of dimensions in which the
   inverse problem is going to be solved, allowing easy posterior analysis.
   To compare the different basis expansions we have studied a simple 1D
   linear inverse problem in gravimetric inversion for a density anomaly
   with Gaussian shape. For this simple toy-problem we show that the
   Fourier basis gives a better reconstruction using Filon's quadrature to
   avoid numerical instabilities caused by highly oscillating functions,
   both, in the noise-free and noisy cases. Besides, the Fourier base is
   the one that provides the lowest reconstruction error for the number of
   basis terms and the highest condition number. The Haar and pixel
   (piecewise-continuous functions) bases provide similar results, although
   the pixel base needs more terms to achieve lower reconstruction errors.
   Also, the pixel basis is the one that has the lowest condition number
   that is obviously related to the way the energy in the system matrix is
   distributed. Besides, the Daubechies Db2 basis expansion is the one that
   has the highest system rank, it is more difficult to apply to project
   the integral kernel, and provides the worst results, compared to the
   other basis expansions. Finally we propose how to generalize this
   methodology to linear inverse problems in several dimensions and to
   non-linear problems. A separate paper will be devoted to this subject.

Volume = {{121}},

Abstract = {{The combined effect of significant solar radiation pressure and
   perturbations on spacecraft orbits is investigated using both singly and
   doubly-averaged disturbing potentials with the Lagrange Planetary
   Equations. The resulting dynamics are applied to a spacecraft around an
   oblate asteroid. Several Sun-frozen families of orbits are identified
   using the singly-averaged potential, including two new families of
   orbits and a previously-discovered equatorial heliotropic orbit family.
   Families of both stable and unstable Sun-frozen orbits are mapped and
   characterized in the singly-averaged case. In addition, a heliotropic
   constraint is implemented to locate heliotropic orbits out of the
   equatorial plane using a constrained, doubly-averaged potential. Dynamic
   bounds for these 3D heliotropic orbits are shown to have an inclination
   limit of approximately 46 degrees for oblate bodies, and this limit is
   independent of the value of and radiation parameters. The resulting
   heliotropic and related periodic families of orbits are good candidates
   to consider for low-altitude science orbits around small oblate bodies
   with low or near-180 degree obliquity like Bennu, the target for the
   OSIRIS-REx mission.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Radioargon isotopes, particularly Ar-37, are currently being considered
   for use as an On-Site Inspection (OSI) relevant radionuclide within the
   context of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). In order to
   understand any soil air measurements taken during an OSI, the radioargon
   background due to cosmic ray induced activation along with other sources
   must be understood. An MCNP6 model was developed using the cosmic ray
   source feature within the code to examine the neutron flux at ground
   level as a function of various conditions: date during the solar
   magnetic activity cycle, latitude of sampling location, geology of the
   sampling location, and sampling depth. Once the cosmic neutron flux was
   obtained, calculations were performed to determine the rate of
   radioargon production for the main interactions. Radioargon production
   was shown to be highly dependent on the soil composition, and a range of
   Ar-37 production values at 1 m depth was found with a maximum production
   rate of 4.012 atoms/sec/m(3) in carbonate geologies and a minimum
   production rate of 0.070 atoms/sec/m(3) in low calcium granite. The
   sampling location latitude was also shown to have a measurable effect on
   the radioargon production rate, where the production of Ar-37 in an
   average continental crust is shown to vary by a factor of two between
   the equator and the poles. The sampling date's position within the solar
   magnetic activity cycle was also shown to cause a smaller change, less
   than a factor of 1.2, in activation between solar maxima and solar
   minima. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We assembled a data set of permeability measurements from 317 subduction
   zone and reference site samples worldwide made over nearly 25years of
   scientific drilling. This data set allowed us to examine the influence
   of grain size, structural domain, and measurement type on permeabilities
   ranging from 10(-21) to 10(-14)m(2). We found that porosity-permeability
   behavior is a function of clay-size fraction, which is consistent with
   previous work. Sediments within the slope, accretionary prism, and
   fault-zone structural domains are strongly affected by shearing, which
   alters the permeability behavior with burial. Consolidation,
   flow-through, and transient pulse decay measurements all provide
   comparable results. Measurements of horizontal and vertical permeability
   show significant cm-scale permeability anisotropy (ratio of horizontal
   to vertical permeability >10) in the slope and accretionary prism
   structural domains, further indicating shear deformation in these
   domains. Laboratory consolidation trends match large-scale (10(2)m)
   field trends in structural domains with negligible shear, but tend to
   underestimate the rate of permeability reduction with porosity loss
   where shear is significant. Comparison with downhole measurements shows
   that permeability is controlled by higher-permeability (>10(-15)m(2))
   layers at the meter to tens of meters scale, while wireline formation
   tester measurements closely match laboratory results. Sediments from the
   underthrust and reference structural domains exhibit similar
   porosity-permeability trends, which suggests that shallow subduction
   (total burial <1km) does not significantly alter the
   porosity-permeability behavior of incoming sediments. Comparison with
   measurements of deeper analog data from 14 passive-margin samples show
   that porosity-permeability trends are maintained through burial and
   diagenesis to porosities <10\%, suggesting that behavior observed in
   shallow samples is informative for predicting behavior at depth
   following subduction.}},

Title = {{Rate Adaptation and Admission Control for Video Transmission With
   Subjective Quality Constraints}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Adapting video data rate during streaming can effectively reduce the
   risk of playback interruptions caused by channel throughput
   fluctuations. The variations in rate, however, also introduce video
   quality fluctuations and thus potentially affects viewers' Quality of
   Experience (QoE). We show how the QoE of video users can be improved by
   rate adaptation and admission control. We conducted a subjective study
   wherein we found that viewers' QoE was strongly correlated with the
   empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) of the predicted video
   quality. Based on this observation, we propose a rate-adaptation
   algorithm that can incorporate QoE constraints on the empirical
   cumulative quality distribution per user. We then propose a
   threshold-based admission control policy to block users whose empirical
   cumulative quality distribution is not likely to satisfy their QoE
   constraint. We further devise an online adaptation algorithm to
   automatically optimize the threshold. Extensive simulation results show
   that the proposed scheme can reduce network resource consumption by 40\%
   over conventional average-quality maximized rate-adaptation algorithms.}},

Title = {{Delay-Constrained Video Transmission: Quality-Driven Resource Allocation
   and Scheduling}},
Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Real-time video demands quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees such as
   delay bounds for end-user satisfaction. Furthermore, the tolerable delay
   varies depending on the use case such as live streaming or two-way video
   conferencing. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of wireless fading
   channels, deterministic delay bounds are difficult to guarantee.
   Instead, we propose providing statistical delay guarantees using the
   concept of effective capacity. We consider a multiuser setup whereby
   different users have (possibly different) delay QoS constraints. We
   derive the resource allocation policy that maximizes the sum video
   quality and applies to any quality metric with concave rate-quality
   mapping. We show that the optimal operating point per user is such that
   the rate-distortion slope is the inverse of the supported video source
   rate per unit bandwidth, a key metric we refer to as the source spectral
   efficiency. We extend the resource allocation policy to capture video
   quality-driven adaptive user-subcarrier assignment in wideband channels
   as well as capture the impact of adaptive modulation and coding. We also
   solve the alternative problem of fairness-based resource allocation
   whereby the objective is to maximize the minimum video quality across
   users. Finally, we derive user admission and scheduling policies that
   enable selecting a maximal user subset such that all selected users can
   meet their statistical delay requirement. Results show that video users
   with differentiated QoS requirements can achieve similar video quality
   with vastly different resource requirements. Thus, QoS-aware scheduling
   and resource allocation enable supporting significantly more users under
   the same resource constraints.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an experimental study on dissociating carbon dioxide
   (CO2) using a microhollow cathode discharge (MHCD) plasma reactor
   operated at 1 atm. The MHCD plasma reactors can be a promising
   technology for dissociating gases, including CO2, as they do not require
   catalysts, they operate at around room temperature, and can be
   inexpensively built and operated. In this study, CO2 balanced with the
   carrier gas argon (Ar) was fed through the MHCD reactor, and parametric
   experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of applied
   voltage, flow rate, and CO2 mole fraction in the influent on the
   composition of the products, energy conversion efficiency, and yield.
   Within the investigated parameter ranges, the maximum energy conversion
   efficiency of 14\% was achieved when the specific energy input was 1.1
   eV mol(-1), whereas the maximum CO yield of 10.5\% was achieved when the
   specific energy input was 4 eV mol(-1). The results also showed that
   diluting CO2 with Ar increased the yield at an expense of a decrease in
   energy conversion efficiency. The results of this study provide insights
   for operating MHCD reactors for efficient gas dissociation at
   atmospheric pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering has evolved with multifaceted research being
   conducted using advanced technologies, and it is progressing toward
   clinical applications. As tissue engineering technology significantly
   advances, it proceeds toward increasing sophistication, including
   nanoscale strategies for material construction and synergetic methods
   for combining with cells, growth factors, or other macromolecules.
   Therefore, to assess advanced tissue-engineered constructs, tissue
   engineers need versatile imaging methods capable of monitoring not only
   morphological but also functional and molecular information. However,
   there is no single imaging modality that is suitable for all
   tissue-engineered constructs. Each imaging method has its own range of
   applications and provides information based on the specific properties
   of the imaging technique. Therefore, according to the requirements of
   the tissue engineering studies, the most appropriate tool should be
   selected among a variety of imaging modalities. The goal of this review
   article is to describe available biomedical imaging methods to assess
   tissue engineering applications and to provide tissue engineers with
   criteria and insights for determining the best imaging strategies.
   Commonly used biomedical imaging modalities, including X-ray and
   computed tomography, positron emission tomography and single photon
   emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound
   imaging, optical imaging, and emerging techniques and multimodal
   imaging, will be discussed, focusing on the latest trends of their
   applications in recent tissue engineering studies.}},

Abstract = {{We expanded an existing model for permeability in mudrocks and shaly
   sands to include computation of effective grain radius and the Archie's
   law parameter in granular media composed of two different grain sizes.
   We found that the effective grain radius is the harmonic mean of the
   endmember grain radii and that can be computed as the geometric mean of
   the endmember values. We tested our model with three-dimensional
   lattice-Boltzmann simulations of flow through dilute and concentrated
   systems, and with comparison to measurements of laboratory-prepared and
   natural samples as well as field data. Modeled permeabilities matched
   the simulated and measured permeabilities over a wide range of
   porosities, grain sizes, and grain shapes. We additionally found that
   the model is independent of grain packing and aspect ratio, as these
   parameters only affect the endmember values. Our predicted
   permeabilities generally fall within previously determined bounds, and
   we derive approximations for permeability as a function of endmember
   permeability for cases when endmember values are equal and when
   endmember grain radii are very different. Our results advance our
   understanding of permeability in heterogeneous porous media.}},

Abstract = {{Retail stores contain a wide range of products that can emit a variety
   of indoor pollutants. Among these chemicals, phthalate esters and
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are two important categories of
   semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). Filters in heating,
   ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system collect particles from
   large volumes of air and thus potentially provide spatially and
   temporally integrated SVOC concentrations. This study measured six
   phthalate and 14 PBDE compounds in HVAC filter dust in 14 retail stores
   in Texas and Pennsylvania, United States. Phthalates and PBDEs were
   widely found in the HVAC filter dust in retail environment, indicating
   that they are ubiquitous indoor pollutants. The potential co-occurrence
   of phthalates and PBDEs was not strong, suggesting that their indoor
   sources are diverse. The levels of phthalates and PBDEs measured in HVAC
   filter dust are comparable to concentrations found in previous
   investigations of settled dust in residential buildings. Significant
   correlations between indoor air and filter dust concentrations were
   found for diethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, and benzyl butyl
   phthalate. Reasonable agreement between measurements and an equilibrium
   model to describe SVOC partitioning between dust and gas-phase is
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural scene statistics (NSSs) models have been developed that make it
   possible to impose useful perceptually relevant priors on the luminance,
   colors, and depth maps of natural scenes. We show that these models can
   be used to develop 3D content creation algorithms that can convert
   monocular 2D videos into statistically natural 3D-viewable videos.
   First, accurate depth information on key frames is obtained via human
   annotation. Then, both forward and backward motion vectors are estimated
   and compared to decide the initial depth values, and a compensation
   process is applied to further improve the depth initialization. Then,
   the luminance/chrominance and initial depth map are decomposed by a
   Gabor filter bank. Each subband of depth is modeled to produce a NSS
   prior term. The statistical color-depth priors are combined with the
   spatial smoothness constraint in the depth propagation target function
   as a prior regularizing term. The final depth map associated with each
   frame of the input 2D video is optimized by minimizing the target
   function over all subbands. In the end, stereoscopic frames are rendered
   from the color frames and their associated depth maps. We evaluated the
   quality of the generated 3D videos using both subjective and objective
   quality assessment methods. The experimental results obtained on various
   sequences show that the presented method outperforms several
   state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D conversion methods.}},

   here is related to the non Gaussian steady states characterizing the
   quantum kinetic behavior. We show that the proposed schemes achieve
   high-order accuracy uniformly in time for all Planck constants ranging

   from kinetic regime to fluid regime. Computational results are presented

Title = {{Reusing metadata across components, applications, and languages}},

Abstract = {{Among the well-known means to increase programmer productivity and
   decrease development effort is systematic software reuse. Although large
   scale reuse remains an elusive goal, programmers have been successfully
   reusing individual software artifacts, including components, libraries,
   and specifications. One software artifact that is not amenable to reuse
   is metadata, which has become an essential part of modern software
   development. Specifically, mainstream metadata formats, including XML
   and Java 5 annotations, are not amenable to systematic reuse. As a
   result, software that uses metadata cannot fully reap the benefits
   traditionally associated with systematic reuse. To address this lack of
   metadata reusability, this article presents Pattern-Based Structural
   Expressions (PBSE), a new metadata format that is not only reusable, but
   also offers conciseness and maintainability advantages. PBSE can be
   reused both across individual program components and across entire
   applications. In addition, PBSE make it possible to reuse
   metadata-expressed functionality across languages. In particular, we
   show how implementations of nonfunctional concerns (commonly expressed
   through metadata) in existing languages can be reused in emerging
   languages via automated metadata translation. Because metadata
   constitutes an intrinsic part of modern software applications, the
   ability to systematically reuse metadata is essential for improving
   programmer productivity and decreasing development effort. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{sRNAs play a significant role in controlling and regulating cellular
   metabolism. One of the more interesting aspects of certain sRNAs is
   their ability to make global changes in the cell by interacting with
   regulatory proteins. In this work, we demonstrate the use of an in vivo
   Tri-molecular Fluorescence Complementation assay to detect and visualize
   the central regulatory sRNA-protein interaction of the Carbon Storage
   Regulatory system in E. coli. The Carbon Storage Regulator consists
   primarily of an RNA binding protein, CsrA, that alters the activity of
   mRNA targets and of an sRNA, CsrB, that modulates the activity of CsrA.
   We describe the construction of a fluorescence complementation system
   that detects the interactions between CsrB and CsrA. Additionally, we
   demonstrate that the intensity of the fluorescence of this system is
   able to detect changes in the affinity of the CsrB-CsrA interaction, as
   caused by mutations in the protein sequence of CsrA. While previous
   methods have adopted this technique to study mRNA or RNA localization,
   this is the first attempt to use this technique to study the
   sRNA-protein interaction directly in bacteria. This method presents a
   potentially powerful tool to study complex bacterial RNA protein
   interactions in vivo. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the development of an oxygen sensor using a
   simple device made from a film of ZnO crystals dispersed over a paper
   surface. Due to the high porosity of this kind of device made from paper
   and ZnO, a large photoconductive effect is observed as result of the
   fast absorption and desorption of oxygen from the ZnO surface. To detect
   oxygen, we propose to use ultraviolet (UV) illumination over the
   photoconductive surface of the sensor, the applied UV light produces
   oxygen desorption causing current variations through the sensor that are
   proportional to the oxygen presence nearby the sensor surface. The
   sensor developed in this paper is attractive because it is remarkably
   easy to fabricate, employs only very low-cost materials for its
   construction, and shows a better sensitivity at low concentration of
   oxygen at partial vacuum environments.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen sorption isotherms in selected glassy and rubbery polymers,
   available over a wide range of temperatures (-20 to 70 degrees C) and
   pressures (0-60 atm) have been modeled and correlated using equilibrium
   and non-equilibrium thermodynamic models based on the lattice fluid
   theory. A good representation of the experimental data can be obtained
   for the systems considered over the whole range of pressures and
   temperatures inspected by using just one fitting parameter, under the
   fundamental assumption that hydrogen behaves as a non-swelling
   penetrant. The theoretical estimates of infinite dilution solubility
   coefficients are in excellent agreement with the experimental data
   Remarkably, the model analysis allows a reliable estimate of the
   isosteric heat of sorption and its dependence on the hydrogen
   concentration over the whole range of pressures considered. A similar
   theoretical analysis has been performed by considering the helium
   sorption data available at 35 degrees C for a series of polymers
   considered for membrane-based gas separations. Finally, He/H-2
   solubility-selectivity at 35 degrees C has been correctly predicted: as
   expected, the glassy Teflonl (R) AF-series perfluorinated copolymers
   display a higher He/H-2 solubility selectivity compared to the
   hydrocarbon-based polymers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Permeability coefficients for pure CO2, pure CH4, and CO2/CH4 mixtures

   3,3'dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-biphenyl (HAB) and
   2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (GFDA) and
   for three thermally-rearranged (TR) derivatives thereof. Permeability
   measurements were made at 35 degrees C for fugacities ranging horn 4 to
   25 atm. The permeability of CO2 and CH4 increased as the degree of TR
   conversion increased. For example, CO2 permeability at 10 atm increased
   by a factor of 30 between the unconverted polyimide and its TR analog
   converted at 450 degrees C. In pure-gas experiments, CO2 was observed to
   plasticize the unconverted polyimide, but it did not appear to
   plasticize the TR polymers in mixed-gas experiments, dual-mode
   competitive sorption caused a depression in CH4 permeability, with very
   little change in CO2 permeability. In addition, plasticization by CO2
   was evident in the CH4 mixed-gas permeability trends, but its impact was
   small in contrast with dual-mode competitive effects. Consequently,
   CO2/CH4 mixed-gas permeability selectivity was higher than the ideal
   selectivity, calculated as the ratio of pure gas permeability
   coefficients. The dual-mode sorption and permeation model was fit to the
   experimental data Dual-mode model parameters and model predictions are
   reported, along with their confidence intervals. By comparing the
   dual-mode model predictions with the experimental mixed-gas data, the
   degree of CO2-induced plasticization was observed to decrease as the
   degree of TR conversion increased and was completely absent (within
   experimental uncertainty) for the TR polymer converted at 450 degrees C.

Abstract = {{This article presents a three-phase methodology for scheduling assembly
   and test operations for semiconductor devices. The facility in which
   these operations are performed is a re-entrant flow shop consisting of
   several dozen to several hundred machines and up to a 1000 specialized
   tools. The semiconductor devices are contained in lots, and each lot
   follows a specific route through the facility, perhaps returning to the
   same machine multiple times. Each step in the route is referred to as a
   ``pass.{''} In the first phase of the methodology an extended assignment
   model is solved to simultaneously assign tooling and lots to the
   machines. Four prioritized objectives are considered: minimize the
   weighted sum of key device shortages, maximize the weighted sum of lots
   processed, minimize the number of machines used, and minimize the
   makespan. In the second phase, lots are optimally sequenced on their
   assigned machines using the same prioritized objectives. Due to the
   precedent relations induced by the pass requirements, some lots may have
   to be delayed or removed from the assignment model solution to ensure
   that no machine runs beyond the planning horizon. In the third phase,
   machines are reset to allow additional lots to be processed when tooling
   is available. The methodology was tested using data provided by the
   Assembly and Test facility of a leading manufacturer. The results
   indicate that high-quality solutions can be obtained within 1hour when
   compared with those obtained with a greedy randomized adaptive search
   procedure. Cost reductions were observed across all objectives and
   averaged 62\% in the aggregate.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{While RNA structures have been extensively characterized in vitro, very
   few techniques exist to probe RNA structures inside cells. Here, we have
   exploited mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation to synthesize
   fluorescence-based probes that assay RNA structures in vivo. Our probing
   system involves the co-expression of two constructs: (i) a target RNA
   and (ii) a reporter containing a probe complementary to a region in the
   target RNA attached to an RBS-sequestering hairpin and fused to a
   sequence encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP). When a region of
   the target RNA is accessible, the area can interact with its
   complementary probe, resulting in fluorescence. By using this system, we
   observed varied patterns of structural accessibility along the length of
   the Tetrahymena group I intron. We performed in vivo DMS footprinting
   which, along with previous footprinting studies, helped to explain our
   probing results. Additionally, this novel approach represents a valuable
   tool to differentiate between RNA variants and to detect structural
   changes caused by subtle mutations. Our results capture some differences
   from traditional footprinting assays that could suggest that probing in
   vivo via oligonucleotide hybridization facilitates the detection of
   folding intermediates. Importantly, our data indicate that intracellular
   oligonucleotide probing can be a powerful complement to existing RNA
   structural probing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Thin metal films can be used to catalyze the growth of nanomaterials in
   place of the bulk metal, while greatly reducing the amount of material
   used. A big drawback of copper thin films (0.5-1.5 mu m thick) is that,
   under high temperature/vacuum synthesis, the mass loss of films severely
   reduces the process time due to discontinuities in the metal film,
   thereby limiting the time scale for controlling metal grain and film
   growth. In this work, we have developed a facile method, namely
   ``covered growth{''} to extend the time copper thin films can be exposed
   to high temperature/vacuum environment for graphene synthesis. The key
   to preventing severe mass loss of copper film during the high
   temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is to have a cover
   piece on top of the growth substrate. This new ``covered growth{''}
   method enables the high-temperature annealing of the copper film upward
   of 4 h with minimal mass loss, while increasing copper film grain and
   graphene domain size. Graphene was then successfully grown on the capped
   copper film with subsequent transfer for device fabrication. Device
   characterization indicated equivalent physical, chemical, and electrical
   properties to conventional CVD graphene. Our ``covered growth{''}
   provides a convenient and effective solution to the mass loss issue of
   thin films that serve as catalysts for a variety of 2D material
   syntheses.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of gaseous mixtures of CO2 and C2H6 in cross-linked
   poly(ethylene oxide) (XLPEO) has been modeled over a wide range of
   temperatures, pressures, and compositions with the Sanchez-Lacombe
   lattice fluid equation of state (LF EoS). The model binary gas-polymer
   parameters have been determined from pure gas solubility data and kept
   constant with temperature and composition. Multicomponent solubility is
   then calculated with no additional adjustable parameters, using a fully
   predictive procedure. The LF EoS model describes well the mixed gas
   solubility behavior data over wide ranges of temperature (from -20 to 35
   degrees C), pressure (0-20 atm), and composition. The model also allows
   the representation of the solubility selectivity behavior of XLPEO at
   different conditions, permitting an a priori determination that ethane
   solubility is significantly enhanced by the presence of CO2, with a
   consequent reduction in CO2/C2H6 solubility selectivity relative to the
   pure gas value. In this regard, the behavior of this rubbery polymer is
   opposite that of many glassy systems, in which competitive sorption is
   often dominant, and the solubility of the less soluble gas (i.e., C2H6
   in this case) is decreased by the presence of CO2, and the CO2
   solubility selectivity is enhanced with respect to the pure gas value.}},

Abstract = {{A technology for optimization of potential parameters from
   condensed-phase simulations (POP) is discussed and illustrated. It is
   based on direct calculations of the derivatives of macroscopic
   observables with respect to the potential parameters. The derivatives
   are used in a local minimization scheme, comparing simulated and
   experimental data. In particular, we show that the Newton trust region
   protocol allows for more accurate and robust optimization. We apply the
   newly developed technology to study the liquid mixture of tert-butanol
   and water. We are able to obtain, after four iterations, the correct
   phase behavior and accurately predict the value of the Kirkwood Buff
   (KB) integrals. We further illustrate that a potential that is
   determined solely by KB information, or the pair correlation function,
   is not necessarily unique}},

Abstract = {{As the isotopic concentration of ultrathin graphite is varied from
   natural abundance to nearly pure C-13, the thermal conductivity displays
   a slight dependence on the isotope concentration at temperatures near
   its maximum similar to 150 K. The strength of phonon-isotope scattering
   in the high-isotope impurity-concentration regime is found to be well
   below that given by a commonly used incoherent and independent isotope
   impurity scattering model. This finding is in agreement with some recent
   theoretical predictions that coherent multiple scattering of phonons is
   important in the measured thermal conductivity of low-dimensional
   materials in the high-isotope impurity-concentration regime.}},

Title = {{Electrochemical Modification of Indium Tin Oxide Using Di(4-nitrophenyl)
   Iodonium Tetrafluoroborate}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Optoelectronic applications often rely on indium tin oxide (ITO) as a
   transparent electrode material. Improvements in the performance of such
   devices as photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes often requires
   robust, controllable modification of the ITO surface to enhance
   interfacial charge transfer properties. In this work, modifier films
   were deposited onto ITO by the electrochemical reduction of
   di(4-nitrophenyl) iodonium tetrafluoroborate (DNP), allowing for control
   over surface functionalization. The surface coverage could be tuned from
   submonolayer to multilayer coverage by either varying the DNP
   concentration or the number of cyclic voltammetry (CV) grafting scans.
   Modification of ITO with 0.8 mM DNP resulted in near-monolayer surface
   coverage (4.95 x 10(14) molecules/cm(2)). X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the presence of 4-nitrophenyl
   (NO2Ph) moieties on the ITO surface through the detection of a NO2
   nitrogen signal at 405.6 eV after grafting. Further XPS evidence
   suggests that the NO2Ph radicals do not bond to the surface indium or
   tin sites, consistent with modification occurring either through bonding
   to surface hydroxyl groups or through strong physisorption on ITO. CV in
   the presence of an electroactive probe and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) were used to investigate the electronic effects that
   modification via DNP has on ITO. Even at submonolayer coverage, the
   insulating organic films can reduce the current response to ferrocene
   oxidation and reduction by more than 25\% and increase the charge
   transfer resistance by a factor of 10.}},

Abstract = {{We are concerned with the numerical simulation of wave motion in
   arbitrarily heterogeneous, elastic,
   perfectly-matched-layer-(PML)-truncated media. We extend in three
   dimensions a recently developed two-dimensional formulation, by treating
   the PML via an unsplit-field, but mixed-field, displacement-stress
   formulation, which is then coupled to a standard displacement-only
   formulation for the interior domain, thus leading to a computationally
   cost-efficient hybrid scheme. The hybrid treatment leads to, at most,
   third-order in time semi-discrete forms. The formulation is flexible
   enough to accommodate the standard PML, as well as the multi-axial
   PML.We discuss several time-marching schemes, which can be used a la
   carte, depending on the application: (a) an extended Newmark scheme for
   third-order in time, either unsymmetric or fully symmetric semi-discrete
   forms; (b) a standard implicit Newmark for the second-order, unsymmetric
   semi-discrete forms; and (c) an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for a
   first-order in time unsymmetric system. The latter is well-suited for
   large-scale problems on parallel architectures, while the second-order
   treatment is particularly attractive for ready incorporation in existing
   codes written originally for finite domains.We compare the schemes and
   report numerical results demonstrating stability and efficacy of the
   proposed formulations. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Geometric characterization and simulation of planar layered elastomeric
   fibrous biomaterials}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{93-101}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Many important biomaterials are composed of multiple layers of networked
   fibers. While there is a growing interest in modeling and simulation of
   the mechanical response of these biomaterials, a theoretical foundation
   for such simulations has yet to be firmly established. Moreover,
   correctly identifying and matching key geometric features is a
   critically important first step for performing reliable mechanical
   simulations. The present work addresses these issues in two ways. First,
   using methods of geometric probability, we develop theoretical estimates
   for the mean linear and areal fiber intersection densities for 2-D
   fibrous networks. These densities are expressed in terms of the fiber
   density and the orientation distribution function, both of which are
   relatively easy-to-measure properties. Secondly, we develop a random
   walk algorithm for geometric simulation of 2-D fibrous networks which
   can accurately reproduce the prescribed fiber density and orientation
   distribution function. Furthermore, the linear and areal fiber
   intersection densities obtained with the algorithm are in agreement with
   the theoretical estimates. Both theoretical and computational results
   are compared with those obtained by post-processing of scanning electron
   microscope images of actual scaffolds. These comparisons reveal
   difficulties inherent to resolving fine details of multilayered fibrous
   networks. The methods provided herein can provide a rational means to
   define and generate key geometric features from experimentally measured
   or prescribed scaffold structural data. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Due to their high aspect ratio, strength, and modulus, multiwall carbon
   nanotubes (MWCNT) have attracted interest as a reinforcing filler in the
   automotive tire industry. In part 1 of this study, we demonstrated that
   styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) composites containing up to 15 wt. \% of
   well-dispersed, discreet MWCNTs can be prepared using MVVCNTs with a
   specific surface modification and controlled aspect ratios. The melt
   rheology of the composites with discreet MWCNT was best described in
   terms of an effective aspect ratio and by considering the discrete MWCNT
   to be flexible rather than rigid rods. In this work, the effect of
   tensile strains, up to values of 6, for cured SBR composites containing
   discreet MWCNT concentrations up to 12\% by weight were investigated.
   The deformation behavior indicates good adhesion between these MWCNT and
   the SBR. Mooney-Rivlin plots derived from the composite tensile
   stress-strain data displayed a dramatic change in mechanical behavior as
   the MWCNT loading exceeded about 5 wt. \% attributed to a combined
   reinforcing effect of tubes on SBR plus overlap of curved or coiled
   MWCNT. Beyond tensile strains of about 1.7, strain hardening increases
   dramatically at MWCNT loading greater than 5 wt. \% that is attributed
   straightening of the initially curved nanotubes such that they behave as
   rigid rods or fibers. Mechanical hysteresis and swelling in toluene on
   cured composites samples revealed that MWCNTs are in fact well bonded to
   the SBR. Studies with SBR and a combination of carbon black and discreet
   MWCNT demonstrate dramatically improved resistance to fracture by
   tearing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes the design and synthesis of a series of
   lamella-forming, silicon-containing block copolymers (Si-BCPs) and
   evaluation of these materials as potential candidates for lithographic
   applications. The interaction parameter of each Si-BCP is measured by
   both the mean-field theory predicted order-disorder transition and by
   analysis of X-ray scattering profiles. The introduction of more-polar
   methoxy and less-polar methylsilyl moieties increases to about 2-3 times
   that of the reference material,
   poly(styrene-block-4-trimethylsilylstyrene). The incremental increases
   appear to be essentially additive in this family of block copolymers,
   suggesting that improvements in can be predicted from appropriate
   monomer choice. Perpendicularly oriented thin-films of the ordered
   Si-BCPs generated by thermally annealing between two neutral polymeric
   surfaces and developed by etching on commercial RIE equipment show
   excellent image fidelity. These images demonstrate the excellent etch
   contrast of the Si-BCPs and document improvements in pattern fidelity
   that are realized with more strongly segregated BCPs. (c) 2014 Wiley

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The presence of gypsum or anhydrite in oil reservoirs limits the
   application of alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding using
   conventional alkalis such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) because these
   alkalis precipitate calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the presence of gypsum
   leading to high alkalinity loss and permeability damage. Sodium
   metaborate (NaBO2) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) were investigated as
   possible alternatives to Na2CO3. Batch mixing experiments were performed
   with these alkalis in the presence of excess gypsum, single phase
   brine-alkali transport experiments were performed in sandstone and
   carbonate cores containing gypsum, and ASP corefloods were performed in
   outcrop and reservoirs cores (containing gypsum). Effluent pH and ion
   concentrations including boron, calcium and sulfate were measured using
   an ion chromatograph (IC) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP). NaBO2
   and NH4OH were found to maintain and propagate a high pH of more than 10
   in the batch and transport experiments without significant permeability
   changes. Gypsum dissolution was not increased by NH4OH (over that of the
   brine itself) in batch or transport experiments. It, however, increased
   during NaBO2 injection depending on the flow rate. High oil recoveries
   and low surfactant retentions were obtained in the ASP corefloods with
   both sodium metaborate and ammonium hydroxide performed in cores
   containing gypsum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonic doped semiconductor nanocrystals promise exciting
   opportunities for new technologies, but basic features of the
   relationships between their structures, compositions, electronic
   structures, and optical properties remain poorly understood. Here, we
   report a quantitative assessment of the impact of composition on the
   energies of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in colloidal
   tin-doped indium oxide (Sn:In2O3, or ITO) nanocrystals. Using a
   combination of aliovalent doping and photodoping, the effects of added
   electrons and impurity ions on the energies of LSPRs in colloidal In2O3
   and ITO nanocrystals have been evaluated. Photodoping allows electron
   densities to be tuned post-synthetically in ITO nanocrystals,
   independent of their Sn content. Because electrons added photochemically
   are easily titrated, photodoping also allows independent quantitative
   determination of the dependence of the LSPR energy on nanocrystal
   composition and changes in electron density. The data show that ITO LSPR
   energies are affected by both electron and Sn concentrations, with
   composition yielding a broader plasmon tuning range than achievable by
   tuning carrier densities alone. Aspects of the photodoping energetics,
   as well as magneto-optical properties of these ITO LSPRs, are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically explore signatures of plasmonic Fano interferences in a
   subwavelength plasmonic metamolecule consisting of closely packed
   asymmetric gold nanodimers, which lead to the possibility of generating
   multiple Fano resonances in the scattering spectrum. This spectral
   feature is attributed to the interference between bright and dark
   plasmonic modes sustained by the constituent nanodimers. The excited
   Fano dips are highly sensitive in both wavelength and amplitude to
   geometry and background dielectric medium. The tunability of induced
   Fano resonances associated with enhanced electric fields from the
   visible to infrared region provides promising applications, particularly
   in refractive index sensing, light-trapping, and photon up-converting.

   structure and capacitance of graphene-like electrodes in ionic liquids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{The electric double layer (C-D) and electrode quantum (C-Q) capacitances
   of graphene-based supercapacitors are investigated using a combined
   molecular dynamics and density functional theory approach. In
   particular, we compare an approach that includes electronic polarization
   to one that is polarization-free by evaluating both C-D and C-Q using
   {[}EMIM]{[}BF4] ionic liquid as a model electrolyte. Our results
   indicate that the inclusion of polarization effects can yield higher C-D
   values-in this study by up to 40\% around +/- 2 V-which we attribute
   primarily to the presence of charge smearing at the
   electrode-electrolyte interface. On the other hand, we find that the
   polarization-induced distortion of the electronic structure of graphene
   does not noticeably alter the predicted C-Q. Our analysis suggests that
   an accurate description of the spatial charge distribution at the
   graphene interface due to polarization is necessary to improve our
   predictive capabilities, though more notably for C-D. However, the
   conventional polarization-free approximation can serve as an efficient
   tool to study trends associated with both the CQ and CD at the interface
   of various graphene-like materials. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Current cancer therapies can cause significant collateral damage due to
   a lack of specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, we explored the cell
   death pathway response to gold nanorod (GNR)-mediated photothermal
   therapy as a highly specific cancer therapeutic to understand the role
   of apoptosis and necrosis during intense localized heating. By
   developing this, we can optimize photothermal therapy to induce a
   maximum of `clean' cell death pathways, namely apoptosis, thereby
   reducing external damage. GNRs were targeted to several subcellular
   localizations within colorectal tumor cells in vitro, and the cell death
   pathways were quantitatively analyzed after photothermal therapy using
   flow cytometry. In this study, we found that the cell death response to
   photothermal therapy was dependent on the GNR localization. Furthermore,
   we demonstrated that nanorods targeted to the perinuclear region
   irradiated at 37.5 W/cm(2) laser fluence rate led to maximum cell
   destruction with the `cleaner' method of apoptosis, at similar
   percentages as other anti-cancer targeted therapies. We believe that
   this indicates the therapeutic potential for GNR-mediated photothermal
   therapy to treat cancer effectively without causing damage to
   surrounding tissue.}},

   Y0.9In0.1BaCo3Zn1 (-) (x)nFe(x)O(7) (+) (delta) series of oxides have
   been investigated as cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells

   single-phase oxides with the P31c space group. Both the x = 0 and 0.2
   samples were stable after 120 h exposure to 600, 700, and 800 degrees C,
   while the x = 0.6 and 0.8 samples showed instability at 700 and 800
   degrees C. The x = 0.4 sample was stable at 600 and 800 degrees C, but
   generated a BaCoO3 impurity phase at 700 degrees C. The reversible
   oxygen absorption tendency of these materials was found to increase with
   increasing Fe content. Increasing the Fe content in the range of 0 <= x

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{DC electrical conductivity, Seebeck and Hall coefficients are measured
   between 300 and 450 K on single crystals of monoclinic bismuth vanadate
   that are doped n-type with 0.3\% tungsten donors (W:BiVO4). Strongly
   activated small-polaron hopping is implied by the activation energies of
   the Arrhenius conductivities (about 300 meV) greatly exceeding the
   energies characterizing the falls of the Seebeck coefficients'
   magnitudes with increasing temperature (about 50 meV). Small-polaron
   hopping is further evidenced by the measured Hall mobility in the
   ab-plane (10(-1) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 300 K) being larger and much less
   strongly activated than the deduced drift mobility (about 5 x 10(-5)
   cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 300 K). The conductivity and n-type Seebeck
   coefficient is found to be anisotropic with the conductivity larger and
   the Seebeck coefficient's magnitude smaller and less temperature
   dependent for motion within the ab-plane than that in the c-direction.
   These anisotropies are addressed by considering highly anisotropic
   next-nearest-neighbor (approximate to 5 angstrom) transfers in addition
   to the somewhat shorter (approximate to 4 angstrom), nearly isotropic
   nearest-neighbor transfers. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have reported that the self-assembly of conjugated
   polymers mimicking rod-coil-rod triblock copolymers (BCPs) in selective
   solvents exhibits unique aggregate morphologies. However, the nature of
   the arrangement of the polymers within the aggregates and the spatial
   organization of the aggregates remain an unresolved issue. We report the
   results of coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations, which
   investigated the self-assembly behavior of rod-coil-rod BCPs in a
   coil-selective solvent. We observe a rapid formation of cylindrically
   shaped multichain clusters. The initial stages of formation of the
   aggregates was seen to be independent of the strength of the solvent
   selectivity. However, for higher solvent selectivities, the clusters
   were seen to merge into larger units at later stages. A reduction in rod
   to coil block ratio was observed to decrease the size and number of
   clusters. In the limit of a highly concentrated solution, we observe the
   formation of a networked system of distinct clusters, which however
   retain the cylindrical arrangement observed at lower polymer
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an algorithm to extract the diffusion tensor from Molecular
   Dynamics simulations with Milestoning. A Kramers-Moyal expansion of a
   discrete master equation, which is the Markovian limit of the
   Milestoning theory, determines the diffusion tensor. To test the
   algorithm, we analyze over-damped Langevin trajectories and recover a
   multidimensional Fokker-Planck equation. The recovery process determines
   the flux through a mesh and estimates local kinetic parameters. Rate
   coefficients are converted to the derivatives of the potential of mean
   force and to coordinate dependent diffusion tensor. We illustrate the
   computation on simple models and on an atomically detailed system-the
   diffusion along the backbone torsions of a solvated alanine dipeptide.

Abstract = {{Simulation of chemically reacting flows using detailed chemistry
   introduces a large number of chemistry model parameters. While not all
   significantly affect the target outcomes of a simulation, the parameters
   that do are not always known a priori. In order to improve simulations
   for specified target outcomes, termed quantities of interest (QoIs), the
   sensitivity of these QoIs to the model parameters are needed. However,
   evaluating the sensitivities is computationally expensive, especially
   for complex fuels that may involve many parameters. For these
   simulations, the forward sensitivity method requires the solution of an
   additional number of governing equations proportional to the number of
   parameters. Here, an adjoint sensitivity approach is formulated where
   the computational cost scales as the number of QoIs and not the number
   of parameters. Specifically, adjoint equations are derived for laminar,
   incompressible, variable density reacting flow and applied to hydrogen
   flame simulations. From the solution of the corresponding adjoint
   equations, sensitivity of the QoIs to chemistry model parameters is
   calculated. The one-dimensional simulation results show that the adjoint
   sensitivity results closely match those of forward sensitivity methods,
   thus providing validation of the adjoint method. The two-dimensional
   simulation results indicate the most sensitive parameters for two QoIs,
   flame tip temperature and NOx emission. For these tests, the adjoint
   method reduces computational expense compared to forward sensitivity
   methods by a factor proportional to the number of QoIs over the number
   of parameters, here 2/172. Such savings can be more drastic for cases
   that involve complex fuels, such as combustion of jet fuel, requiring
   thousands of chemistry model parameters. Further, this sensitivity
   information can be used in development of experiments by pointing out
   which are the critical chemistry model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene and related two-dimensional crystals and hybrid systems
   showcase several key properties that can address emerging energy needs,

   electrical and thermal conductivity, make it promising as a catalyst in
   fuel and dye-sensitized solar cells. Chemically functionalized graphene
   can also improve storage and diffusion of ionic species and electric
   charge in batteries and supercapacitors. Two-dimensional crystals
   provide optoelectronic and photocatalytic properties complementing those
   of graphene, enabling the realization of ultrathin-film photovoltaic
   devices or systems for hydrogen production. Here, we review the use of
   graphene and related materials for energy conversion and storage,

   at variable speeds. Depending on the wind speed, a turbine switches
   between two operating modes: a low wind speed mode and a high wind speed
   mode. During the low wind speed mode, the control objective is to
   maximise wind energy capture by controlling both the blade pitch angle
   and the electrical generator torque. During the high wind speed mode,
   the control goal is to maintain the rated power generation by only
   adjusting the blade pitch angle. This paper establishes the stability
   criteria for the switching operation of wind turbines using
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   gain under the nonlinear control framework. Also, the performance of the
   wind turbine system is analysed by using the step response, a well-known
   measure for second-order linear systems.}},

Abstract = {{Consider an arbitrary power network with PV and PQ buses, where active
   powers and voltage magnitudes are known at PV buses, and active and
   reactive powers are known at PQ buses. The classical power flow (PF)
   problem aims to find the unknown complex voltages at all buses. This
   problem is usually solved approximately through linearization or in an
   asymptotic sense using Newton's method, given that the solution belongs
   to a good regime containing voltage vectors with small angles. The
   question arises as to whether the PF problem can be cast as the solution
   of a convex optimization problem over that regime. The objective of this
   paper is to show that the answer to the above question is affirmative.
   More precisely, we propose a class of convex optimization problems with
   the property that they all solve the PF problem as long as angles are
   small. Each convex problem proposed in this work is in the form of a
   semidefinite program (SDP). Associated with each SDP, we explicitly
   characterize the set of complex voltages that can be recovered via that
   convex problem. Since there are infinitely many SDP problems, each
   capable of recovering a potentially different set of voltages, designing
   a good SDP problem is cast as a convex problem.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) has become the de-facto standard for
   multivariable control in the process industries. MPC systems are able to
   handle complex dynamics, interactions and constraints, but are
   vulnerable to plant-model mismatch. The deviation of the process model
   from the plant is an inevitable phenomenon, caused by drifting equipment
   properties and process conditions. In this contribution, we introduce a
   novel autocovariance-based framework for estimating MPC plant-model
   mismatch from closed-loop operating data. Our initial results focus on
   SISO systems, where we begin by establishing an explicit relationship
   between the autocovariance of process input and output data, and the
   magnitude of the plant-model mismatch. We use this result to establish
   an optimization-based approach for solving the inverse problem, that is,
   computing plant-model mismatch from available data. We present a
   numerical study, where we demonstrate the excellent performance of the
   proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies an optimal control problem for continuous-time
   stochastic systems subject to objectives specified in a subclass of

   real-time constraints. We propose a computational method for
   synthesizing an optimal control policy that maximizes the probability of
   satisfying a specification based on a discrete approximation of the
   underlying stochastic system. First, we show that the original problem
   can be formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem in a state
   space augmented with finite memory and states of some clock variables.
   Second, we present a numerical method for computing an optimal policy
   with which the given specification is satisfied with the maximal
   probability in point-based semantics in the discrete approximation of
   the underlying system. We show that the policy obtained in the discrete
   approximation converges to the optimal one for satisfying the
   specification in the continuous or dense-time semantics as the
   discretization becomes finer in both state and time. Finally, we
   illustrate our approach with a robotic motion planning example.}},

   quantitative temporal logic constraints can be formulated as linear
   programming problems. However, centralized synthesis algorithms do not
   scale to many practical systems. To tackle this issue, we propose a
   decomposition-based distributed synthesis algorithm. By decomposing a
   large-scale stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process into
   a collection of interacting sub-systems, the original control problem is
   formulated as a linear programming problem with a sparse constraint
   matrix, which can be solved through distributed optimization methods.
   Additionally, we propose a decomposition algorithm which automatically
   exploits, if it exists, the modular structure in a given large-scale

Abstract = {{Aluminum honeycomb sandwich structures are widely used in aerospace
   applications, and are generally favored for their high specific strength
   and stiffness. However, experimental studies of their orbital debris
   shielding performance have shown an undesirable tendency to channel
   impact debris from a front face sheet impact, towards the back face
   sheet, inhibiting lateral debris dispersion. Hence published
   experimental research has evaluated the orbital debris shielding
   performance of aluminum foam sandwich panels, as a potential structural
   alternative. The limitations of light gas gun technology mean that
   experimental studies of this type can only investigate the lower half of
   the impact velocity regime of interest in low earth orbit applications.
   Recent research has conducted a series of 49 impact simulations,
   employing a hybrid-particle element method, in order to estimate the
   orbital debris shielding performance of aluminum foam sandwich panels
   for impact conditions which cannot be duplicated in the laboratory. The
   simulation results suggest that published scaling laws which extrapolate
   the experimental data base outside the testable range provide an
   accurate estimate of metal foam shielding performance over the full
   impact velocity range of interest for spacecraft operating in low earth
   orbit.}},

   1100 days, with a minimum of 300 days in Mars vicinity (opportunity
   dependent). The entire spaceship is recaptured into cis-lunar space and
   can be reused. The spaceship consists of a habitat for 4 crew attached
   to the Hybrid propulsion stage which uses long duration electric and
   chemical in-space propulsion technologies that are in use today. The
   hybrid architecture's con-ops has no in-space assembly of the crew
   transfer vehicle and requires only rendezvous of crew in a highly
   elliptical Earth orbit for arrival at and departure from the spaceship.
   The crew transfer vehicle does not travel to Mars so it only needs be
   able to last in space for weeks and re-enter at lunar velocities. The
   spaceship can be refueled and resupplied for multiple trips to Mars
   (every other opportunity). The hybrid propulsion stage for crewed
   transits can also be utilized for cargo delivery to Mars every other
   opportunity in a reusable manner to pre-deploy infrastructure required
   for Mars vicinity operations. Finally, the Hybrid architecture provides
   evolution options for mitigating key long-duration space exploration
   risks, including crew microgravity and radiation exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with uniform planar arrays
   (UPAs), which is often referred to as full-dimension (FD) MIMO, is being
   strongly considered for future wireless communication standards. FD-MIMO
   can control transmit and receive beams in both the horizontal and
   vertical domains and fully exploit the large number of antennas of
   massive MIMO. It is widely accepted that Kronecker-product codebooks
   using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) structure are suitable to
   quantize the downlink channel at the user for FD-MIMO systems relying on
   frequency division duplexing (FDD). In this paper, we numerically study
   the characteristics of FD-MIMO channels using a three-dimensional (3D)
   channel model that captures realistic channel properties. Based on the
   study, we identify a limitation of conventional Kronecker-product
   codebooks and propose advanced channel quantization techniques that can
   further improve channel quantization quality.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a threshold-based antenna selection algorithm
   for uplink dense cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), where a baseband
   processor unit (BBU) cloud is separately placed from densely deployed
   remote radio heads (RRHs). The proposed algorithm consists of two
   phases. In the first phase, each RRH determines whether to be included
   or not in a candidate set by using a predefined selection threshold. In
   the second phase, a RRH is randomly selected within the candidate set
   made in the first phase. By modeling the network with a homogeneous
   Poisson point process (PPP), the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
   complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) is derived when
   applying the proposed algorithm. Exploiting the derived expression, an
   approximate optimum selection threshold that maximizes the SIR coverage
   performance is obtained in terms of relevant system parameters, chiefly
   the SIR target, the pathloss exponent, and the RRH and user densities.
   Simulations demonstrate the performance of the obtained selection
   threshold. The key advantage of the proposed algorithm is its
   simplicity. Since the complexity caused by selecting a RRH is reasonable
   irrespective of the density of the RRH while guaranteeing the certain
   performance, the proposed algorithm is easily applied in a C-RAN where
   the RRHs are densely deployed.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless link adaptation configures the physical layer of the

   link performance under error rate reliability constraints. Typically,
   error rate reliability targets are defined externally and remain fixed,

   link adaptation to define its own error rate reliability target. We
   derive a closed form expression for the optimal target block error rate
   (BLER) that maximizes the throughput with hybrid automatic repeat
   request (HARQ). This expression shows that the optimal BLER target is
   inversely proportional to the SINR. We conduct LTE simulations with link
   adaptation that exploits the optimal BLER target to reinforce the
   utility of our derived BLER target expression and to showcase that a
   performance improvements of up to 30\% in throughput can be obtained

Abstract = {{Hybrid precoding, a combination of analog and digital precoding, is an
   attempt to reach a compromise between complexity and performance. By
   exploiting more than one RF chain, hybrid precoding enables a millimeter
   wave (mmWave) system to take advantage of both spatial multiplexing and
   beamforming gain. A major challenge with hybrid precoding is its
   configuration in wideband systems. The reason is that the analog
   beamforming weights are the same across the entire band. In this paper,
   we propose a frequency selective hybrid precoding technique for a mmWave
   orthogonal frequency division multiple access system. We propose an
   algorithm to jointly optimize the wideband analog beamformers and the
   per-subcarrier digital precoders. We compare an upper bound with our
   solution and show that our optimized approach achieves good performance
   in terms of beamforming gain in the sense that it minimizes the loss
   caused by allocating multiple users to different subcarriers with a
   limited number of radio frequency chains.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to the existing lower frequency wireless power transfer,
   millimeter wave (mmWave) power transfer takes advantage of the
   high-dimensional multi-antenna and narrow beam transmission. In this
   paper we introduce wireless power transfer for mmWave cellular networks.
   Here, we consider users with large energy storage that are recharged by
   the mmWave base stations prior to uplink information transmission, and
   analyze the average harvested energy and average achievable rate.
   Numerical results corroborate our analysis and show that the serving
   base station plays a dominant role in wireless power transfer, and the
   contribution of the interference power from the interfering base
   stations is negligible, even when the interfering base stations are
   dense. By examining the average achievable rate in the uplink, when
   increasing the base station density, a transition from a noise-limited
   regime to an interference-limited regime is observed.}},

Abstract = {{We study upper bounds on the sum-rate of multiple-unicasts. We
   approximate the Generalized Network Sharing Bound (GNS cut) of the
   multiple-unicasts network coding problem with k independent sources. Our
   approximation algorithm runs in polynomial time and yields an upper
   bound on the joint source entropy rate, which is within an O (log(2) k)
   factor from the GNS cut. It further yields a vector-linear network code
   that achieves joint source entropy rate within an O (log(2) k) factor
   from the GNS cut, but not with independent sources: the code induces a
   correlation pattern among the sources.
   Our second contribution is establishing a separation result for
   vector-linear network codes: for any given field F there exist networks
   for which the optimum sum-rate supported by vector-linear codes over F
   for independent sources can be multiplicatively separated by a factor of
   k(1-delta), for any constant delta > 0, from the optimum joint entropy
   rate supported by a code that allows correlation between sources.
   Finally, we establish a similar separation result for the asymmetric
   optimum vector-linear sum-rates achieved over two distinct fields F-p
   and F-q for independent sources, revealing that the choice of field can
   heavily impact the performance of a linear network code.}},

   constant (and ideally approaches one). This problem is equivalent to the
   design of multiset Batch Codes introduced by Ishai, Kushilevitz,

   We give families of multiset batch codes with asymptotically optimal
   rates of the form 1 - 1/poly (k) and a number of servers m scaling
   polynomially in the number of read requests k. An advantage of our batch
   code constructions over most previously known multiset batch codes is
   explicit and deterministic decoding algorithms and asymptotically
   optimal fault tolerance.
   Our main technical innovation is a graph-theoretic method of designing
   multiset batch codes using dense bipartite graphs with no small cycles.
   We modify prior graph constructions of dense, high-girth graphs to
   obtain our batch code results. We achieve close to optimal tradeoffs

Abstract = {{Future wireless standards such as 5G envision dense wireless networks
   with large number of simultaneously connected devices. In this context,
   interference management becomes critical in achieving high spectral
   efficiency. Orthogonal signaling, which limits the number of users
   utilizing the resource simultaneously, gives a sum-rate that remains
   constant with increasing number of users. An alternative approach called
   interference alignment promises a throughput that scales linearly with
   the number of users. However, this approach requires very high SNR or
   long time duration for sufficient channel variation, and therefore may
   not be feasible in real wireless systems. We explore ways to manage
   interference in large networks with delay and power constraints.
   Specifically, we devise an interference phase alignment strategy that
   combines precoding and scheduling without using power control to exploit
   the diversity inherent in a system with large number of users. We show
   that this scheme achieves a sum-rate that scales almost logarithmically
   with the number of users. We also show upper bounds on the sum-rate
   within the restricted class of single-symbol phase alignment schemes.
   Specifically, we prove that no scheme in this class can achieve better
   than logarithmic scaling of the sum-rate.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic testing plays a vital role in increasing software
   reliability. A particularly effective and popular approach for
   systematic testing is symbolic execution, which analyzes a large number
   of program behaviors using symbolic inputs. Even though symbolic
   execution is among the most studied analyses during the last decade,
   scaling it to real-world applications remains a key challenge. This
   paper studies how a class of semantics-preserving program
   transformations, namely compiler optimizations, which are designed to
   enhance performance of standard program execution (using concrete
   inputs), influence traditional symbolic execution. As an enabling
   technology, the study uses KLEE, a well-known symbolic execution engine
   based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and focuses on 33
   optimization flags of LLVM. Our specific research questions include: (1)
   how different optimizations influence the performance of symbolic
   execution for Unix Coreutils, (2) how the influence varies across two
   different program classes, and (3) how the influence varies across three
   different back-end constraint solvers. Some of our findings surprised
   us. For example, applying the 33 optimizations in a pre-defined order
   provides a slowdown (compared to applying no optimization) for a
   majority of the Coreutils when using the basic depth-first search with
   no constraint caching. The key finding of our work is that standard
   compiler optimizations need to be used with care when performing
   symbolic execution for creating tests that provide high code coverage.
   We hope our study motivates future research on harnessing the power of
   symbolic execution more effectively for enhancing software reliability,
   e.g., by designing program transformations specifically to scale
   symbolic execution or by studying broader classes of traditional
   compiler optimizations in the context of different search heuristics,
   memoization, and other strategies employed by modern symbolic execution
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Because main memory is vulnerable to errors and failures, large-scale
   systems and critical servers utilize error checking and correcting (ECC)
   mechanisms to meet their reliability requirements. We propose a novel
   mechanism, Frugal ECC (FECC), that combines ECC with fine-grained
   compression to provide versatile protection that can be both stronger
   and lower overhead than current schemes, without sacrificing
   performance. FECC compresses main memory at cache -block granularity,
   using any left over space to store ECC information. Compressed data and
   its ECC information are then frequently read with a single access even
   without redundant memory chips; insufficiently compressed blocks require
   additional storage and accesses. As examples, we present
   chipkill-correct ECCs on a non-ECC DIMM with x4 chips and the first true
   chipkill-correct ECC for x8 devices using an ECC DIMM. FECC relies on a
   new Coverage-oriented-Compression that we developed specifically for the
   modest compression needs of ECC and for floating-point data.}},

   multipole method and apply it to kernel regression. The motivation for
   this work is the approximation of kernel matrices, which appear in
   mathematical physics, approximation theory, non-parametric statistics,
   and machine learning. Existing fast multipole methods are asymptotically
   optimal, but the underlying constants scale quite badly with the ambient
   space dimension. We introduce a method that mitigates this shortcoming;
   it only requires kernel evaluations and scales well with the problem
   size, the number of processors, and the ambient dimension-as long as the
   intrinsic dimension of the dataset is small. We test the performance of
   our method on several synthetic datasets. As a highlight, our largest
   run was on an image dataset with 10 million points in 246 dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Mantle convection is the fundamental physical process within earth's
   interior responsible for the thermal and geological evolution of the
   planet, including plate tectonics. The mantle is modeled as a viscous,
   incompressible, non-Newtonian fluid. The wide range of spatial scales,
   extreme variability and anisotropy in material properties, and severely
   nonlinear rheology have made global mantle convection modeling with
   realistic parameters prohibitive. Here we present a new implicit solver
   that exhibits optimal algorithmic performance and is capable of extreme
   scaling for hard PDE problems, such as mantle convection. To maximize
   accuracy and minimize runtime, the solver incorporates a number of
   advances, including aggressive multi-octree adaptivity, mixed
   continuous-discontinuous discretization, arbitrarily-high-order
   accuracy, hybrid spectral/geometric/algebraic multigrid, and novel
   Schur-complement preconditioning. These features present enormous
   challenges for extreme scalability. We demonstrate that-contrary to
   conventional wisdom-algorithmically optimal implicit solvers can be
   designed that scale out to 1.5 million cores for severely nonlinear,
   ill-conditioned, heterogeneous, and anisotropic PDEs.}},

Abstract = {{Nearest neighbor search is a cornerstone problem in computational
   geometry, non-parametric statistics, and machine learning. For N points,
   exhaustive search requires quadratic work, but many fast algorithms
   reduce the complexity for exact and approximate searches. The common
   kernel (k NN kernel) in all these algorithms solves many small-size
   problems exactly using exhaustive search. We propose an e ffi cient
   implementation and performance analysis for the k NN kernel on x86
   architectures. By fusing the distance calculation with the neighbor
   selection, we are able to utilize memory throughput. We present an
   analysis of the algorithm and explain parameter selection. We perform an
   experimental study varying the size of the problem, the dimension of the
   dataset, and the number of nearest neighbors. Overall we observe signi
   fi cant speedups. For example, when searching for 16 neighbors in a
   point dataset with 1.6 million points in 64 dimensions, our kernel is
   over 4 times faster than existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{In system-on-chip (SOC) designs, embedded processors are frequently
   present as part of the functional design and can be used to help test
   the chip or system by providing a software-based test. Previous work has
   looked at compacting output responses in software by performing
   signature analysis using either arithmetic operations or by implementing
   a multi-input signature register (MISR) in software. However, these
   approaches cannot be used when the output response contains unknown (X)
   values. While it is possible to precisely mask all X's present in the
   output response in software, a straightforward approach would require a
   very large amount of mask data to specify which bits to mask. This paper
   proposes an efficient method for compacting output responses with X's in
   software using the concept of canceling X's from signatures as proposed
   in {[}Touba 07], Whereas the efficiency of the hardware implementation
   in {[}Touba 07] is constrained by needing to minimize the hardware
   overhead, in software these constraints are not present. Thus, a novel
   and more efficient implementation is proposed here. Moreover, the
   efficiency is further improved by incorporating a low cost partial
   X-masking step in software as well. Results indicate that output
   responses with significant X densities can be very efficiently compacted
   using the proposed software-based scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Combinational linear compactors can be used to compact the output
   response for a large number of scan chains into a smaller number of
   outputs. While some compactor designs can guarantee observation of all
   scan chains in the presence of a small number of X's, this may not be
   sufficient for designs with higher X densities. This paper describes an
   approach for using a combinational rotator between the scan chains and
   compactor to allow detection of faults even in the presence of high X
   densities. It is shown that the number of control inputs to the rotator
   is comparable to the number of control inputs required by conventional X
   masking approaches, but by not masking, the proposed approach is able to
   provide higher observability which translates to fewer test patterns,
   better compression, and better coverage of non-modeled faults. Moreover,
   the control data for the rotator has many more don't cares than the
   control data for X masking thereby making it easier and more efficient
   to compress with a linear decompressor. A heuristic procedure for
   ordering the inputs to a combinational compactor to increase the
   probability of observation for a given maximum shift distance is also
   presented. Experimental results indicate that high observability can be
   achieved using the proposed method with a relatively small number of
   control inputs.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a distributed user selection strategy in a network MIMO
   setting with M base stations serving K users. Each base station is
   equipped with L antennas, where LM << K. The conventional selection
   strategy is based on a well known technique called semi-orthogonal user
   selection when the zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) is adopted. Such
   technique, however, requires perfect channel state information at the
   transmitter (CSIT), which might not be available or need large feedback
   overhead. This paper proposes an alternative distributed user selection
   technique where each user sets a timer that is inversely proportional to
   his channel quality indicator (CQI), as a means to reduce the feedback
   overhead. The proposed strategy allows only the user with the highest
   CQI to respond with a feedback. Such technique, however, remains
   collision free only if the transmission time is shorter than the
   difference between the strongest user timer and the second strongest
   user timer. To overcome the situation of longer transmission times, the
   paper proposes another feedback strategy that is based on the theory of
   compressive sensing, where collision is allowed and all users encode
   their feedback information and send it back to the basestations
   simultaneously. The paper shows that the problem can be formulated as a
   block sparse recovery problem which is agnostic on the transmission
   time, which makes it a good alternative to the timer approach when
   collision is dominant.}},

   Carbon Fiber Reinforce Polymer (CFRP) sheets and anchors, for jacketing

   splices, providing continuity to reinforcement; were used for retrofit
   techniques. ASCE41-07 and ASCE41-13 provisions are compared using these

Abstract = {{We present a parallel treecode for fast kernel summation in high
   dimensions-a common problem in data analysis and computational
   statistics. Fast kernel summations can be viewed as approximation
   schemes for dense kernel matrices. Treecode algorithms (or simply
   treecodes) construct low-rank approximations of certain off-diagonal
   blocks of the kernel matrix. These blocks are identified with the help
   of spatial data structures, typically trees. There is extensive work on
   treecodes and their parallelization for kernel summations in three
   dimensions, but there is little work on high-dimensional problems.
   Recently, we introduced a novel treecode, ASKIT, which resolves most of
   the shortcomings of existing methods.
   We introduce novel parallel algorithms for ASKIT, derive complexity
   estimates, and demonstrate scalability on synthetic, scientific, and
   image datasets. In particular, we introduce a local essential tree
   construction that extends to arbitrary dimensions in a scalable manner.
   We introduce data transformations for memory locality and use GPU
   acceleration. We report results on the ``Maverick{''} and ``Stampede{''}
   systems at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. Our largest computations
   involve two billion points in 64 dimensions on 32,768 x86 cores and 8

Abstract = {{Regression testing is widely used in practice for validating program
   changes. However, running large regression suites can be costly.
   Researchers have developed several techniques for prioritizing tests
   such that the higher-priority tests have a higher likelihood of finding
   bugs. A vast majority of these techniques are based on dynamic analysis,
   which can be precise but can also have significant overhead (e.g., for
   program instrumentation and test-coverage collection). We introduce a
   new approach, REPiR, to address the problem of regression test
   prioritization by reducing it to a standard Information Retrieval
   problem such that the differences between two program versions form the
   query and the tests constitute the document collection. REPiR does not
   require any dynamic profiling or static program analysis. As an enabling
   technology we leverage the open-source IR toolkit Indri. An empirical
   evaluation using eight open-source Java projects shows that REPiR is
   computationally efficient and performs better than existing (dynamic or
   static) techniques for the majority of subject systems.}},

Abstract = {{In the human hand, tendons and ligaments are important soft tissues that
   transfer forces from muscles to finger joints and coordinate the complex
   finger movements. However in conventional robotic hand research, their
   functions are often simplified by cables and linkages due to biological
   counterparts' complicated shapes and branching mechanism. In order to
   better simulate the neuromuscular control strategy of the human hand, we
   believe that it is important to replicate the salient features of the
   biological ligaments and tendons using artificial materials. To this
   end, we design and fabricate the artificial extensor hood for the
   anatomically correct testbed (ACT) hand via innovative crochet
   technique. The resulting artificial extensor hood resemble not only the
   shape and branching mechanism but also the varying fiber orientation in
   ligaments of its human counterparts. We successfully validate our design
   efficacy through finger movement experiments and quantitatively test the
   mechanical properties of the crocheted tendons under different branching
   conditions. We find that the crocheted ligament has a force-displacement
   behavior similar to that of the human hand and possesses a five times
   higher breaking strength on average.}},

Abstract = {{Graphics processing units (GPUs) range from small, embedded designs to
   large, high-powered discrete cards. While the performance of graphics
   workloads is generally understood, there has been little study of the
   performance of GPGPU applications across a variety of hardware
   configurations. This work presents performance scaling data gathered for
   267 GPGPU kernels from 97 programs run on 891 hardware configurations of
   a modern GPU. We study the performance of these kernels across a 5x
   change in core frequency, 8.3x change in memory bandwidth, and 11x
   difference in compute units. We illustrate that many kernels scale in
   intuitive ways, such as those that scale directly with added
   computational capabilities or memory bandwidth. We also find a number of
   kernels that scale in non-obvious ways, such as losing performance when
   more processing units are added or plateauing as frequency and bandwidth
   are increased. In addition, we show that a number of current benchmark
   suites do not scale to modern GPU sizes, implying that either new
   benchmarks or new inputs are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new algorithm for all-quad meshing of
   non-convex domains, with connected regions. Our method starts with a
   strongly balanced quadtree. In contrast to snapping the grid points onto
   the geometric boundaries, we move points a slight distance away from the
   common boundaries. Then we intersect the moved grid with the geometry.
   This allows us to avoid creating any flat quads, and we are able to
   handle two-sided regions and more complex topologies than prior methods.
   The algorithm is provably correct, robust, and cleanup-free; meaning we
   have angle and edge length bounds, without the use of any pillowing,
   swapping, or smoothing. Thus, our simple algorithm is also more
   predictable than prior art. (C) 2015 Sandia Corporation and The Authors.

Abstract = {{Many phenomena in the applied and natural sciences occur on surfaces. To
   solve accurately the corresponding partial differential equations
   (PDEs), it is often necessary to adapt the mesh, based upon the geometry
   of the surface, or based upon the behaviour of the PDE solution. Moving
   mesh methods are particularly efficient strategies in many situations.
   PDEs explicitly involving the mesh speed, called moving mesh PDEs
   (MMPDEs), offer a robust technique to adapt the mesh. In this work, we
   implement, with the C++ finite element library deal.II, a mesh
   adaptation based on Winslow's adaptation functional. We generalize the
   moving mesh problem to curved surfaces by deriving appropriate
   mathematical and finite element formulations. Furthermore, a simple
   method using surface parameterization is developed and implemented using
   deal.II. The results, for both fixed and dynamically adapting meshes,
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{We present a simple but effective algorithm for generating topologically
   and geometrically consistent quality triangular surface meshing of
   compactly packed multiple heterogeneous domains in R-3. By compact
   packing we imply that adjacent homogeneous domains or materials share
   some 0, 1, and/or 2 dimensional boundary. Such packed multiple material
   (or multi-material) solids arise naturally from
   classification/partitioning/segmentation of homogeneous domains in R3
   into different sub-regions. The multi-materials may also represent
   separate functionally classified sections or just be multiple component
   copies tightly fused together as perhaps by layered manufacturing
   processes. The input to our algorithm is a geometric representation of
   the entire multi-material solid, and a volumetric classification map
   identifying the individual materials. As output, each individual
   material region is represented by a triangulated 2-manifold boundary,
   with adjacent material regions having shared boundaries. Our algorithm
   has been implemented, and applied to different multi-material solids,
   and the results are additionally presented with quantitative analysis of
   detection and cure of non-manifold interfaces as well as spurious small
   components. These meshes are useful for combined boundary element
   analysis, however these simulation results are not presented. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We describe the generation of all possible shell and dome shapes that
   can be uniquely meshed (tiled) using a single type of mesh face (tile),
   and following a single meshing (tiling) rule that governs the mesh
   (tile) arrangement with maximal vertex, edge and face symmetries. Such
   tiling arrangements or congruently tiled meshed shapes, are frequently
   found in chemical forms (fullerenes or Bucky balls, crystals,
   quasi-crystals, virus nano shells or capsids), and synthetic shapes
   (cages, sports domes, modern architectural facades). Congruently tiled
   meshes are both aesthetic and complete, as they support maximal mesh
   symmetries with minimal complexity and possess simple generation rules.
   Here, we generate congruent tilings and meshed shape layouts that
   satisfy these optimality conditions. Further, the congruent meshes are
   uniquely mappable to an almost regular 3D polyhedron (or its dual
   polyhedron) and which exhibits face-transitive (and edge-transitive)
   congruency with at most two types of vertices (each type transitive to
   the other). The family of all such congruently meshed polyhedra create a
   new class of meshed shapes, beyond the well-studied regular,
   semi-regular and quasi-regular classes, and their duals (platonic,
   Catalan and Johnson). While our new mesh class is infinite, we prove
   that there exists a unique mesh parametrization, where each member of
   the class can be represented by two integer lattice variables, and
   moreover efficiently constructable. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an independent evaluation of the accuracy and
   precision of high-speed field measurements of pavement surface
   distresses taken by three different 3D systems that represent the
   state-of-the-practice of automated distress collection equipment. The
   analyzed distress data was collected from a field experiment that
   comprised twenty 550-ft test sections that included both flexible and
   rigid pavements. The high-speed measurements produced were compared to
   manual measurements taken statically by experienced raters. The paper
   also presents a qualitative comparison between the crack maps produced
   at highway speeds and digital crack maps collected statically by manual
   measurement of the cracks. In addition, before-and-after analyses were
   conducted to assess for the change in accuracy achieved after conducting
   a visual inspection, and manual corrections, of the automated
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Motorcycles are an important form of personal transportation used by
   many Americans. They provide an enjoyable recreational opportunity for
   many and a convenient, functional mode of transportation for others.
   However, U.S. motorcycle crash rates are 68\% higher (per vehicle-mile
   traveled {[}VMT]) than those for other vehicles, and their fatal crash
   rates are more than 28 times higher. This investigation examines the
   riding and crash experiences and safety perceptions and recommendations
   of 238 U.S. motorcyclists. Top rider recommendations to other
   motorcyclists are to wear a helmet, to avoid riding under the influence
   (of alcohol or drugs), and to obtain motorcycle training. Ordered probit
   model results for helmet-use prediction suggest that those who ride on a
   daily or weekly basis and have received formal motorcycle training are
   more likely to wear a helmet. Other results show that rider training is
   most common among those who wear a helmet, ride on a weekly or monthly
   basis, and ride to and from work, school, and/or errands. Negative
   binomial model results for crash count experiences suggest that
   long-distance riders and those with criminal convictions are at greater
   risk of crashing than others, whereas those who have not received
   motorcycle training are less likely to have been involved in a crash at
   some point in their riding history.}},

Abstract = {{We study device-to-device (D2D) enabled hierarchical cellular networks
   consisting of a macro base station (BS), a dense network of access nodes
   (ANs) and mobile users, where spectrum is shared between cellular
   traffic and D2D traffic. Further, (the receivers of) mobile users
   dynamically time-share between the cellular and D2D networks. We develop
   algorithms for channel allocation and mobile-user receiver mode
   selection (choosing which network to participate in) with the objectives
   of minimizing delay for cellular traffic, and capacity maximization for
   D2D traffic. Our proposed solution takes advantage of the unique
   features offered by large and densified cellular networks such as
   multi-point connectivity, channel diversity, spatial reuse and load
   distribution.
   Given a BS-to-mobile delay requirement of d + 1 time-slots, we show that
   by appropriately scheduling channels and receiver modes, we can (with
   exponentially high probability) guarantee that cellular traffic reaches
   its intended destination within d time-slots. By leveraging spatial
   channel reuse, we show that this is achieved by utilizing a vanishingly
   small fraction of the available spatial capacity. Further, in the
   presence of delay-constrained cellular traffic, our scheduling algorithm
   guarantees D2D traffic can achieve rates within a (1 - 1/d) factor of
   the corresponding achievable rates without cellular traffic.}},

Abstract = {{Adders are the most fundamental arithmetic units, and often on the
   timing critical paths of microprocessors. Among various adder
   configurations, parallel prefix structures provide the high performance
   adders for higher bit-widths. With aggressive technology scaling, the
   performance of a parallel prefix adder, in addition to the dependence on
   the logic level, is determined by wire-length and congestion which can
   be mitigated by adjusting fan-out. This paper proposes a polynomial-time
   algorithm to synthesize n bit parallel prefix adders targeting the
   minimization of the size of the prefix graph with log2n logic level and
   any arbitrary fan-out restriction. The design space exploration by our
   algorithm provides a set of pareto-optimal solutions for delay vs. power
   trade-off, and these pareto-optimal solutions can be used in
   high-performance designs instead of picking from a fixed library (Kogge
   Stone, Sklansky etc.). Experimental results demonstrate that our
   approach (i) excels highly competitive industry standard Synopsys Design
   Compiler adder (128 bit) in performance (2\%), area (25\%) and power
   (13.3\%) in 32nm technology node, and (ii) improves performance/area
   over even 64 bit custom designed adders targeting 22nm technology
   library and implemented in an industrial highperformance design.}},

Abstract = {{JavaFlow, is an extreme multi-core, multi-network DataFlow Machine
   implementing a Java Virtual Machine aimed at addressing technology
   roadmap issues with the ability to effectively utilize and manage large
   numbers of processing cores. Specific design challenges addressed
   include: design complexity through a common set of repeatable
   structures; low power and reliability by featuring unused circuits and
   ability to power off or bypass sections of the chip; and clock
   propagation and wire limits by using locality to bring data to
   processing elements.
   A static Data Flow Architecture is used with multiple heterogeneous
   networks to connect processing elements capable of executing a single
   Java ByteCode instruction. Whole methods are cached in this DataFlow
   fabric, and the networks plus distributed intelligence are used for
   their management and execution. Analysis of SPEC JVM benchmarks
   demonstrates the potential for this design concept.
   A baseline configuration is defined with a compressed dataflow structure
   and then compared to multiple configurations of instruction assignments
   and clock relationships. Using a series of methods from the SPEC
   benchmark running independently, IPC (Instructions per Cycle)
   performance of the sparsely populated heterogeneous structure is 40\% of
   the baseline. The average ratio of instructions to required nodes is
   3.1. Innovative solutions to the loading and management of Java methods
   along with the translation from control flow to DataFlow structure are
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Booth Encoding is a common technique utilized in the design of
   high-speed multipliers. These multipliers typically encode just one
   operand of the multiplier, and this asymmetry results in different power
   characteristics as each input transitions to the next value in a
   pipelined design. Relative to the non-encoded input, changes on the
   Booth-encoded input induce more signal transitions requiring similar to
   73\% more multiplier array energy. This paper proposes low-overhead
   approaches to take advantage of this asymmetric behalior to reduce the
   energy of multiplication operations in pipelined SIMD architectures like
   CPUs. Compiler-based approaches that apply constant or uniform inputs to
   the Booth-encoded input of the multiplier can save 4.8\% of multiplier
   energy on average. An additional 1.5\% savings can be achieved with
   dynamic detection and steering of uniform inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Growing computer system sizes and levels of integration have made memory
   reliability a primary concern, necessitating strong memory error
   protection. As such, large-scale systems typically employ error checking
   and correcting codes to trade redundant storage and bandwidth for
   increased reliability. While stronger memory protection will be needed
   to meet reliability targets in the future, it is undesirable to further
   increase the amount of storage and bandwidth spent on redundancy. We
   propose a novel family of single-tier ECC mechanisms called Bamboo ECC
   to simultaneously address the conflicting requirements of increasing
   reliability while maintaining or decreasing error protection overheads.
   Relative to the state-of-the-art single-tier error protection, Bamboo
   ECC codes have superior correction capabilities, all but eliminate the
   risk of silent data corruption, and can also increase redundancy at a
   fine granularity, enabling more adaptive graceful downgrade schemes.
   These strength, safety, and flexibility advantages translate to a
   significantly more reliable memory system. To demonstrate this, we
   evaluate a family of Bamboo ECC organizations in the context of
   conventional 72b and 144b DRAM channels and show the significant error
   coverage and memory lifespan improvements of Bamboo ECC relative to
   existing SEC-DED, chipkill-correct and double-chipkill-correct schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile Web applications have become an integral part of our society.
   They pose a high demand for application quality of service (QoS).
   However, the energy-constrained nature of mobile devices makes
   optimizing for QoS difficult. Prior art on energy efficiency
   optimizations has only focused on the trade-off between raw performance
   and energy consumption, ignoring the application QoS characteristics. In
   this paper, we propose the concept of energy-efficient QoS (eQoS) to
   capture the trade-off between QoS and energy consumption. Given the
   fundamental event-driven nature of mobile Web applications, we further
   propose event-based scheduling as an optimization framework for eQoS.
   The event-based scheduling automatically reasons about users' QoS
   requirements, and accurately slacks the events' execution time to save
   energy without violating end users' experience. We demonstrate a working
   prototype using the Google Chromium and V8 framework on the Samsung
   Exynos 5410 SoC (used in the Galaxy S4 smartphone). Based on real
   hardware and software measurements, we achieve 41.2\% energy saving with
   only 0.4\% of QoS violations perceptible to end users.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency is undoubtedly important for GPU architectures.
   Besides the traditionally explored energy-efficiency optimization
   techniques, exploiting the supply voltage guard-band remains a promising
   yet unexplored opportunity. Our hardware measurements show that up to
   23\% of the nominal supply voltage can be eliminated to improve GPU
   energy efficiency by as much as 25\%. The key obstacle for exploiting
   this opportunity lies in understanding the characteristics and root
   causes of large voltage droops in GPU architectures and subsequently
   smoothing them away without severe performance penalties. The GPU's
   manycore nature complicates the voltage noise phenomenon, and its
   distinctive architecture features from the CPU necessitate a
   GPU-specific voltage noise analysis. In this paper, we make the
   following contributions. First, we provide a voltage noise
   categorization framework to identify, characterize, and understand
   voltage noise in the manycore GPU architecture. Second, we perform a
   microarchitecture-level voltage-droop root-cause analysis for the two
   major droop types we identify, namely the local first-order droop and
   the global second-order droop. Third, on the basis of our categorization
   and characterization, we propose a hierarchical voltage smoothing
   mechanism that mitigates each type of voltage droop. Our evaluation
   shows it can reduce up to 31\% worst-case droop, which translates to
   11.8\% core-level and 7.8\% processor-level energy reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Memory errors have been a major source of system failures and fault
   rates may rise even further as memory continues to scale. This
   increasing fault rate, especially when combined with advent of
   integrated on-package memories, may exceed the capabilities of
   traditional fault tolerance mechanisms or significantly increase their
   overhead. In this paper, we present FreeFault as a hardware-only,
   transparent, and nearly-free resilience mechanism that is implemented
   entirely within a processor and can tolerate the majority of DRAM
   faults. FreeFault repurposes portions of the last-level cache for
   storing retired memory regions and augments a hardware memory scrubber
   to monitor memory health and aid retirement decisions. Because it relies
   on existing structures (cache associativity) for retirement/remapping
   type repair, FreeFault has essentially no hardware overhead. Because it
   requires a very modest portion of the cache (as small as 8KB) to cover a
   large fraction of DRAM faults, FreeFault has almost no impact on
   performance. We explain how FreeFault adds an attractive layer in an
   overall resilience scheme of highly-reliable and highly-available
   systems by delaying, and even entirely avoiding, calling upon software
   to make tradeoff decisions between memory capacity, performance, and
   reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have numerous configuration and design
   options, including core frequency, number of parallel compute units
   (CUs), and available memory bandwidth. At many stages of the design
   process, it is important to estimate how application performance and
   power are impacted by these options.
   This paper describes a GPU performance and power estimation model that
   uses machine learning techniques on measurements from real GPU hardware.
   The model is trained on a collection of applications that are run at
   numerous different hardware configurations. From the measured
   performance and power data, the model learns how applications scale as
   the GPU's configuration is changed. Hardware performance counter values
   are then gathered when running a new application on a single GPU
   configuration. These dynamic counter values are fed into a neural
   network that predicts which scaling curve from the training data best
   represents this kernel. This scaling curve is then used to estimate the
   performance and power of the new application at different GPU
   configurations.
   Over an 8x range of the number of CUs, a 3.3x range of core frequencies,
   and a 2.9x range of memory bandwidth, our model's performance and power
   estimates are accurate to within 15\% and 10\% of real hardware,
   respectively. This is comparable to the accuracy of cycle-level
   simulators. However, after an initial training phase, our model runs as
   fast as, or faster than the program running natively on real hardware.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids are poised to become a major worldwide development in light
   of the numerous benefits they offer. However, the control and management
   of such systems require keen attention, as stability issues in
   microgrids have proven to be an important topic of research. It is a
   point of emphasis, that microgrids operating as stand-alone systems are
   particularly unforgiving in the sense that the combined inertia of local
   synchronous generators may not be significant enough to ensure good
   stability margins. Therefore, energy storage may be prescribed as a
   mitigation option for achieving frequency and voltage stability in
   low-inertia systems. This paper considers the electrical frequency
   dynamics of low-inertia microgrids as well as the voltage regulation
   implications of associated power electronic interfaces. A design
   criterion for sizing energy storage systems (ESS) is provided to ensure
   that frequency and voltage stability margins are not violated in face of

   Previous efforts towards modeling bandpass natural responses have not
   focused on finding closed-form quantative models of bivariate natural
   statistics. Towards filling this gap, Su et al. {[}1] recently modeled
   spatially adjacent bandpass image responses over multiple scales;
   however, they did not consider the effects of spatial distance between
   the bandpass samples. Here we build on Su et al.'s model and extend
   their closed-form correlation model to non-adjacent distant bandpass
   image responses over multiple spatial orientations and scales.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we design the wireless link of a novel vascular stent
   antenna, which is a key component of future in-vessel telemetry systems.
   To achieve an efficient link, both the antenna loss and propagation loss
   should be characterized and minimized. Firstly, a detailed computational
   model of tissue-induced path loss is proposed and validated to
   characterize path loss. Meanwhile, antenna loss is analyzed through
   microwave simulation of an exact stent model embedded in chest phantom.
   Analysis proves that 433 MHz transmission leads to minimum total link
   loss, that indicates the accomplished link can reduce port-to-port loss
   to 38 dB, which is 18.5 dB lower than the lowest loss under similar
   conditions reported to date. Secondly, we conduct 4 experiments (1
   free-space, 3 in-vitro) to verify the theoretical and emulational
   results. Finally, we prove feasibility of 433 MHz in-vessel coronary
   artery telemetry system with the link budget analysis.}},

   flicker distortions as a function of eccentricity, motion speed, video
   quality, and flicker frequency. We found that either large eccentricity
   or large, coherent object motion could reduce flicker visibility. When
   they are combined, flicker visibility significantly decreased. Flicker
   visibility remained noticeable even at large eccentricity when the
   object was static. Human study results and statistical analysis show
   that highly eccentric, coherent object motion can significantly silence
   the awareness of flicker distortions on naturalistic videos.}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent load balancing is essential to fully realize the benefits of
   dense heterogeneous networks. Current techniques have largely been
   studied with single slope path loss models, though multi-slope models
   are known to more closely match real deployments. This paper develops
   insight into the performance of biasing and uplink/downlink decoupling
   for user association in HetNets with dual slope path loss models. It is
   shown that dual slope path loss models change the tradeoffs inherent in
   biasing and reduce gains from both biasing and uplink/downlink
   decoupling. The results show that with the dual slope path loss models,
   the bias maximizing the median rate is not optimal for other users,
   e.g., edge users. Furthermore, optimal downlink biasing is shown to
   realize most of the gains from downlink-uplink decoupling. Moreover, the
   user association gains in dense networks are observed to be quite
   sensitive to the path loss exponent beyond the critical distance in a
   dual slope model.}},

Abstract = {{Meter measurements in the power grid are susceptible to manipulation by
   adversaries that can lead to errors in state estimation. This paper
   presents a general framework to study attacks on state estimation by
   adversaries capable of injecting bad-data into measurements and further,
   of jamming their reception. Through these two techniques, a novel
   `detectable jamming' attack is designed that changes the state
   estimation despite failing bad-data detection checks. Compared to
   commonly studied `hidden' data attacks, these attacks have lower costs
   and a wider feasible operating region. It is shown that the entire
   domain of jamming costs can be divided into two regions, with distinct
   graph-cut based formulations for the design of the optimal attack. The
   most significant insight arising from this result is that the
   adversarial capability to jam measurements changes the optimal
   `detectable jamming' attack design only if the jamming cost is less than
   half the cost of bad-data injection. A polynomial time approximate
   algorithm for attack vector construction is developed and its efficacy
   in attack design is demonstrated through simulations on IEEE test
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to traditional computing systems, such as desktops and
   servers, that are programmed to perform ``compute-bound{''} and
   ``run-to-completion{''} tasks, mobile applications are designed for user
   interactivity. Factoring user interactivity into computer system design
   and evaluation is important, yet possesses many challenges. In
   particular, systematically studying interactive mobile applications
   across the diverse set of mobile devices available today is difficult
   due to the mobile device fragmentation problem. At the time of writing,
   there are 18,796 distinct Android mobile devices on the market and will
   only continue to increase in the future. Differences in screen sizes,
   resolutions and operating systems impose different interactivity
   requirements, making it difficult to uniformly study these systems.
   We present Mosaic, a cross-platform, timing-accurate record and replay
   tool for Android-based mobile devices. Mosaic overcomes device
   fragmentation through a novel virtual screen abstraction. User
   interactions are translated from a physical device into a
   platform-agnostic intermediate representation before translation to a
   target system. The intermediate representation is human-readable, which
   allows Mosaic users to modify previously recorded traces or even
   synthesize their own user interactive sessions from scratch. We
   demonstrate that Mosaic allows user interaction traces to be recorded on
   emulators, smartphones, tablets, and development boards and replayed on
   other devices. Using Mosaic we were able to replay 45 different Google
   Play applications across multiple devices, and also show that we can
   perform cross-platform performance comparisons between two different
   processors under identical user interactions.}},

   of real power grids to natural disasters and presents improved bounds to
   quantify the size of the expected damage induced. The performance of the
   derived bounds are demonstrated through simulations on an IEEE test case

   construct attacks on systems that are resilient to undetectable attacks.
   The conditions governing a successful data attack of the proposed model
   are presented along with guarantees on its performance. The complexity
   of constructing an optimal attack is discussed and two polynomial time
   approximate algorithms for attack vector construction are developed. The
   performance of the proposed algorithms and efficacy of the hidden attack
   model are demonstrated through simulations on IEEE test systems.}},

Abstract = {{Failures of power grid components during natural disasters like
   hurricanes can fragment the network and lead to creation of islands and
   blackouts. The propagation of failures in actual power grids following a
   catastrophic event differs significantly and thus is harder to analyze
   than on random networks. This paper studies the structural vulnerability
   of real power grids to natural disasters and presents improved bounds to
   quantify the size of the expected damage induced. The performance of the
   derived bounds are demonstrated through simulations on an IEEE test case
   and a real grid network. Further a framework based on the
   eigen-decomposition of the power grid network is used to study
   adversarial attacks aimed to minimize network resilience. The insights
   gained are used to design reinforcement measures to improve network
   resilience against such adversaries.}},

Abstract = {{Multicore and manycore processors are now ubiquitous, but parallel
   programming remains as difficult as it was 30-40 years ago. In this
   talk, I will argue that these problems arise largely from the
   computation-centric abstractions that we currently use to think about
   parallelism. In their place, I will propose a novel data-centric
   foundation for parallel programming called the operator formulation in
   which algorithms are described in terms of unitary actions on data
   structures. This data-centric view of parallel algorithms shows that a
   generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism
   is ubiquitous even in complex, irregular graph applications such as mesh
   generation and partitioning algorithms, graph analytics, and machine
   learning applications. Binding time considerations provide a unification
   of parallelization techniques ranging from static parallelization to
   speculative parallelization. We have built a system called Galois, based
   on these ideas, for exploiting amorphous data-parallelism on multicores
   and GPUs. I will present experimental results from our group as well as
   from other groups that are using the Galois system.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic metamaterials (AMM) are heterogeneous materials with dynamic
   subwavelength structures that can generate useful effective responses of
   interest to ultrasonic imaging applications such as negative refraction
   and zero index. Traditional effective medium models fail to capture
   details of frequency dependent AMM response and can give non-causal
   properties. This work derives non-local expressions for effective
   properties for an infinite periodic lattice of heterogeneities in an
   isotropic fluid using conservation of mass and momentum and the equation
   of state. The resulting model correctly predicts a causal effective
   material response by considering coupling between the ensemble-averaged
   volume strain and momentum fields. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

   three-dimensional architectures are designed based on the following
   notional distribution system topologies namely, ring bus and
   breaker-and-a-half. Three-dimensional topologies are simulated by
   supplying equipment loads using both upper and lower levels of the
   shipboard power system connected using vertical tie-buses. The
   reliability indices obtained for three-dimensional topologies are
   compared to that of the notional planar topologies. The results conclude
   that for each notional topology, a more reliable shipboard power system
   is obtained by designing a three-dimensional architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental cooling loads comprise 11\% of overall electric usage in
   the United States, and during peak cooling months in hot/ humid climates
   these cooling loads can comprise more than 50\% of peak electric energy
   loads. Thermal storage systems can shift these environmental cooling
   loads to non-peak hours, making better use of baseload generation
   capacity as well as reducing the need for expensive and environmentally
   inefficient peak power plants. Residential and small commercial
   buildings generate much of the cooling responsible for peak electric
   load, but these structures may not have the space or facilities to
   support conventional sensible energy thermal storage systems, such a
   chilled water thermal storage tanks. For these applications a compact,
   high-density, retrofittable thermal storage system is needed. This paper
   investigates the development, testing, and modeling of a compact,
   scalable PCM (phase change material) based latent thermal storage system
   for these applications. The results show that a simple
   tube-encapsulated, tetradecane PCM-based thermal storage system can
   reduce the size of a thermal store by at a factor of between 2 and 4
   while providing acceptable energy recovery rates. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This study continues {[}1] the examination of the long-term global
   response of a floating vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) situated off
   the Portuguese coast in the Atlantic Ocean. The VAWT, which consists of
   a 5-MW 3-bladed H-type rotor developed as part of the EU-FP7 H2OCEAN
   project, is assumed to be mounted on the OC4 semi-submersible floating
   platform. Adding a non-operational load case (wind speed similar to
   35m/s), the sea states identified are used to carry out coupled dynamics
   simulations using the FloVAWT design tool, for which an improved wave
   elevation and relative force/moment time signals approach is adopted, as
   well as also taking into account the drag generated by the wind turbine
   tower. Short-term turbine load and platform motion statistics are
   established for individual sea states that are analysed. The long-term
   reliability yields estimates of 50-year loads and platform motions that
   takes into consideration response statistics from the simulations as
   well as the metocean (wind-wave) data and distributions. The results
   show that it is not necessarily the load cases associated with the
   highest wind speed that lead to the highest displacements and tensions
   in the mooring lines; differences among the highest values in some load
   cases are too similar to establish which one should be considered in a
   conceptual/preliminary design phase. Also, the aerodynamic drag model
   needs to be further developed to improve its accuracy. These results and
   insights contribute to the development of improved floating VAWT design
   guidelines for reducing the cost of offshore wind energy generation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates infrastructure-free orbital Simultaneous
   Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Individual surface landmarks are
   tracked through images taken in orbit and the filter receives
   measurements of these landmarks in the form of bearing angles. The
   filter then updates the spacecraft's position and velocity as well as
   landmark locations, thus building a map of the orbited body. In contrast
   to other approaches that use an IMU, which doesn't work in orbit, to
   resolve scale, the contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that
   scale can be resolved using orbital dynamics. Radio localization can be
   replaced with onboard localization, enabling truly autonomous missions
   to both under-mapped and unmapped planetary bodies.
   Overall system convergence is shown by simulating landmark detection
   from an orbit of the Clementine Mission on a Moon model constructed
   using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) digital elevation data in
   conjunction with the filter. The techniques developed in this work
   demonstrate that when combined with a gravity model, visual SLAM
   converges to a full scale solution.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical fault injection is widely used for analyzing hardware in the

   highly efficient technique which is suitable for detailed vulnerability
   analysis of a processor. The technique involves specific sets of
   assembly language routines, and is shown to be much more efficient and
   comprehensive compared with traditional statistical error injection on a
   predetermined set of benchmarks. We have shown the effectiveness of the
   method using error injection in an ARM Amber25 processor model. Our
   analysis is based on more than 330,000 simulation runs with single
   bit-flips on the sequential elements of this processor running our
   synthetic benchmarks and 40,000 FPGA-based error injections for 4

Abstract = {{We present a study on the tradeoffs between three design parameters for
   robotic task systems that function in partially unknown and unstructured

   of training effort to teach the robot to perform the task, (2) the time
   available to complete the task from the point when the command is given
   to perform the task, and (3) the quality of the result from performing
   the task. This paper presents a tradeoff study in this design space for
   a common robotic task, specifically, grasping of unknown objects in
   unstructured environments. The imprecise computation model is used to
   provide a framework for this study. The results were validated with a
   real robot and contribute to the development of a systematic approach

Abstract = {{Today's ubiquitous wireless networks enable easy access to information
   on the web. However, when applications need access to highly transient
   and hyper-localized information, web access is not as efficient as
   sharing directly with co-located devices. This context information can
   be easily collected by commodity mobile devices and shared via
   device-to-device interactions. Open challenges remain in making this
   exchange as efficient and effective as possible. In this paper, we
   propose the Grapevine Context Processor (GCP), which provides a
   framework and a set of APIs for representing and sharing context
   information. GCP is built on the Grapevine context sharing framework,
   which is underpinned by a suite of novel space-efficient context
   representing data structures. GCP, as a context processing framework,
   enables application developers to easily specify context types of
   interest and provide relevant semantic filters for those types; we
   design a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow
   easy access to and control over the data structures.}},

Abstract = {{Recent droughts and heat waves have revealed the vulnerability of some
   power plants to effects from higher temperature intake water for
   cooling. To avoid heating the cooling water beyond temperature
   thresholds set by the EPA, some plants have been forced to reduce their
   power generation. At the same time, future warming of water resources
   from heat waves, droughts, or climate change might increase ambient air
   temperature (one of the primary factors affecting intake temperature,
   and thus cooling effluent temperature) putting plants at risk of even
   greater de-rating. In this evaluation, we sought to model and predict
   which plants would have the greatest risk of de-rating due to thermal
   discharge limits. To do so, we created a regression model of average
   monthly intake temperatures for open loop and recirculating cooling pond
   systems for power plants in the Upper Mississippi River Basin using
   ambient air temperature, wind speed, historical intake temperatures, and
   historical effluent temperatures. We then integrate that information
   into a thermodynamic model of energy flows within each power plant to
   determine the change in cooling water temperature that occurs at each
   plant. We use these models in tandem to determine effluent temperature
   at 43 power plants in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. For the years
   modeled, 2010-2012, the model estimated the intake temperature using the
   linear regression within 2.2 degrees C of the observed values and
   estimated the effluent temperature within 5.0 degrees C of the observed
   values. For years outside of the estimation period, 2008-2009, the model
   estimated effluent temperature within 5.1 degrees C of the observed
   values.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that using metakaolin is an effective
   strategy for mitigation of alkali-silica reaction (ASR). Metakaolin
   reduces the OH-, K+ and Na+ concentrations in pore solution. The high
   aluminium content in metakaolin has also been shown to contribute to ASR
   reduction. However, the efficacy of calcined clays from different
   sources and qualities for ASR mitigation is still limited. This study
   investigated the mechanisms of ASR suppression by using one known highly
   reactive fine aggregate and four calcined clays from different sources.
   The optimum replacement for ASR mitigation was determined by replacing 5
   \%, 10 \%, 15 \% and 20 \% of portland cement with the different
   calcined clays and then tested for expansion in the accelerated mortar
   bar test (AMBT). Results indicated the chemical composition and mineral
   phase of calcined clays had a significant influence on the efficacy of
   ASR mitigation. In addition, ASR gel was found in control mixture and
   the mixture with 10 \% calcined clay 1 (CC1). ASR gel composition was
   investigated into the two mixtures by using energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS) in coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   but no significant differences were found in gel composition between the
   two mixtures.}},

   holes, assisted by a pair of lossy and active sheets in front and behind
   the screen. The required conditions for eliminating reflections (no
   back-scattered power) and shadow (no change in the field strength behind
   the screen) as well for full tunneling of energy are investigated. It is
   shown that positioning an active layer behind a highly reflective
   metallic sheet, one can fully recreate the incident wave behind the
   shield. Finally we show that a parity-time-symmetric pair of a lossy
   layer in front and an active layer behind the metallic layer makes both
   forward and backward scattered powers zero.}},

Abstract = {{Of increasing interest to the computer vision community is to recognize
   egocentric actions. Conceptually, an egocentric action is largely
   identifiable by the states of hands and objects. For example, ``drinking
   soda{''} is essentially composed of two sequential states where one
   first ``takes up the soda can{''}, then ``drinks from the soda can{''}.
   While existing algorithms commonly use manually defined states to train
   action classifiers, we present a novel model that automatically mines
   discriminative states for recognizing egocentric actions. To mine
   discriminative states, we propose a novel kernel function and formulate
   a Multiple Kernel Learning based framework to learn adaptive weights for
   different states. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e.,
   RGBD-Ego, ADL, and GTEA, clearly show that our recognition algorithm
   outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Memory faults are the most common fault in current systems. Strong
   memory error protection techniques prevent most memory faults from
   immediately affecting applications and the system, but come at a high
   and possibly increasing cost as system size increases and fabrication
   technology continues to scale. To effectively protect against memory
   faults and errors, a combination of online error-checking and correcting
   codes are used in conjunction with module replacement. This paper makes
   two contributions. First, we study the magnitude of the silent data
   corruption problem when faulty modules are replaced in a timely manner.
   Second, we show that currently rarely-used fine-grained repair
   mechanisms drastically reduce both the module replacement rate and the
   risk of silent data corruption in large systems.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic effects of electrode implantation in the brain tissue alter the
   neural channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over time. Variability of
   signal quality over time poses a difficult challenge in long-term
   decoding of neural signals for Brain Computer Interface (BCI).
   Specifically, all channels observed during a neural recording session
   may not be observed during the next recording session. This paper
   describes a novel approach that effectively overcomes these challenges
   by identifying reliable channels and features in any given trial,
   estimating unobservable or unreliable features and adapting the neural
   signal classifier with no user input in real time. The proposed decoder
   predicts one of eight arm directions with an accuracy, unmatched in the
   literature, of above 90\% in two monkeys over 4-6 weeks, achieving
   robustness against time and also varying environmental conditions.
   Application of these decoders reduces neural prosthetic training time
   and user frustration thus improving the usability of BCI.}},

   artifact. The algorithm relies on subspace learning and template
   matching. QRS complex detection during exercise is a challenging problem
   because multiple artifacts affect the ECG measurement. Motion artifact
   is considered to be the main disturbance added to the measurement during
   exercise. To deal with the problem, we train a dictionary to represent
   motion artifact using information from a tri-axis accelerometer, and
   then remove the artifact contribution from noisy ECG measurements. We
   select the GCC-PHAT filter for efficient QRS detection on the denoised
   ECG measurements. We show that the proposed algorithm has appreciably
   higher motion artifact reduction capability and lower computational
   complexity than competing algorithms. It is therefore a preferred
   alternative for implementation in mobile health monitoring systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a clustering strategy for semi-static mulhull
   cooperation. Semi-static multicell cooperation exploits multiple
   predefined base station (BS) cluster patterns for improving cell-edge
   user throughput. The proposed clustering guarantees that every user
   communicates with their two closest BSs, so that users are protected
   from the dominant interferer. The key idea of the proposed clustering is
   to use the 2nd-order Voronoi region to form BS clusters, Each of the
   formed BS clusters is mapped into a particular cluster pattern by
   exploiting the edge-coloring in graph theory. Through simulations, the
   performance is compared to that of other conventional strategies. Our
   major finding is that the proposed clustering provides performance gains
   for cell-edge users compared to that of the conventional strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we apply a general control framework, Whole-Body
   Operational Space Control (WBOSC), to an under-actuated point-foot
   biped. We use WBOSC to reproduce the behavior of the Prismatic Inverted
   Pendulum (PIP) as the center of mass dynamics for our point foot biped.
   We present and analyze a new algorithm that dynamically balances the PIP
   model by choosing footstep placements. Our algorithm uses the shooting
   method and numerical integration to find a footstep location even when
   the robot's constraints do not permit an analytic solution to the model
   dynamics. This approach stabilizes the robot in simulation, and keeps
   the physical robot upright for as many as 15 steps. The primary
   limitation appears to be inaccurate foot positioning.}},

Abstract = {{Model reduction and tuning rules given in the SIMC (Simple Internal
   Model Control) method are very effective in tuning PI controllers. For
   sonic processes with large lead elements, control performances by the
   SIMC method are somewhat oscillatory or sluggish. To mitigate such
   drawbacks, additional tuning rules based on the second order plus time
   delay model with lead term are proposed. Improvements for certain types
   of models are critical. For such processes, besides the SIMC tuning
   rule, no PI controller tuning rules that are anal tic and given in terms
   of process parameters are not available. Since the proposed tuning rules
   are very simple, the can be used in the field, effectively complementing
   the SIMC method. (c) 2015, IFAC (International Federation or Automatic

Abstract = {{Today's mobile and pervasive computing devices are embedded with
   increasingly powerful sensing capabilities that enable them to provide
   exceptional spatio-temporal context acquisition that is not possible
   with traditional static sensor networks alone. As a result, enabling
   these devices to share context information with one another has a great
   potential for enabling mobile users to exploit the nearby cyber and
   physical environments in participatory or human-centric computing.
   However, because these mobile devices are owned by and sense information
   about individuals, sharing the acquired context raises significant
   privacy concerns. In this paper, we define Magpie, which implements an
   alternative to existing all-or-nothing sharing solutions. Magpie
   integrates a decentralized context-dependent and adaptive trust scheme
   with a privacy preserving sharing mechanism to evaluate the risk of
   disclosing potentially private data. The proposed method uses this
   assessment to dynamically determine the sharing strategy and the quality
   of the context shared. Conceptually, Magpie allows devices to actively
   obfuscate context information so that sharing is still useful but does
   not breach user privacy. To our knowledge this is the first work to take
   both trust relationships and users' individual privacy sensitivities
   into account to balance sharing and privacy preservation. We describe
   Magpie and then evaluate it in a series of application-oriented
   experiments running on the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE)
   simulator.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has become a major
   reliability concern in nanoscale designs. Although several previous
   studies have been proposed to address the NBTI effect during logic
   synthesis, their performance is limited because of focusing on a certain
   logic synthesis stage. Additionally, their complicated algorithms are
   not scalable to large designs. To tackle this, we propose a coordinated
   and scalable logic synthesis approach, which integrates techniques at
   different logic synthesis stages, ranging from subject graph to
   technology mapping and mapped netlist, to achieve an effective NBTI
   reduction. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that considers
   and mitigates NBTI impact in subject graphs, the earlier stage of logic
   synthesis. Experimental results on industry-strength benchmarks show
   that our approach can achieve 6.5\% NBTI delay reduction with merely
   2.5\% area overhead on average, while a previous work barely gets NBTI
   delay reduction when the circuits are optimized beforehand, the circuit
   sizes are large, and standard cell libraries are richer.}},

Abstract = {{Transformative technologies such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) create an
   opportunity to reinvent features of the traffic network to improve
   efficiency. The focus of this work is dynamic lane reversal: using AV
   communications and behavior to change the direction vehicles are allowed
   to travel on a road lane with much greater frequency than would be
   possible with human drivers. This work presents a novel methodology
   based on the linear programming formulation of dynamic traffic
   assignment using the cell transmission model for solving the system
   optimal (SO) problem. The SO assignment is chosen because the
   communications and behavior protocols necessary to operate AV
   intersection and lane reversal controls could be used to assign routes
   and optimize network performance. This work expands the model to
   determine the optimal direction of lanes at small space-time intervals.
   Model assumptions are outlined and discussed. Results demonstrate the
   model and explore the dynamic demand scenarios which are most conducive
   to increasing system efficiency with dynamic lane reversal.}},

Abstract = {{Landing systems for large unmanned air vehicles have stringent integrity
   requirements as well as demanding system continuity requirements that
   often lead to triplex avionics architectures. Triplex avionics
   architectures are designs that have triple redundancy for key functions.
   Mid-level voting (MLV) algorithms that select the median value from
   among the three solutions are commonly used to select among available
   sensors and navigation solutions. When each solution is computed using a
   single suite of avionics, such median values are robust to single
   airborne sensor failures and provide improved unfaulted accuracy as
   well. Robustness to single faults results because a single faulted
   sensor will not impact the solutions computed by the other two sets of
   avionics. System accuracy is improved for zero mean error solutions
   because the median value is more concentrated about the truth than any
   of the single solutions. When performing fault tree analysis for
   integrity risk in the unfaulted case, it is common to treat sensors'
   errors as being mutually independent. In the case of multiple carrier
   phase differential GPS (CDGPS) solutions, this assumption is invalid due
   to common atmospheric errors and common reference receiver errors. This
   paper aims to quantify the unfaulted integrity risk from triplex
   correlated CDGPS solutions for float, fixed, and almost fixed baselines
   that use a MLV algorithm. The bound on the integrity risk is compared
   with that of independent solutions to show the impact of incorrectly
   assuming independence of CDGPS solutions. Triplex performance is
   compared to simplex to show improvement or degradation in unfaulted
   availability of integrity.}},

   Therefore, while not obvious, fire safety and its impact on
   sustainability are inextricably linked. One of the decisions related to
   both sustainability and fire safety is the selection of thermal
   insulation materials. Insulating materials have always been an integral
   part of building design, serving as a key component in thermally
   controlling indoor environments. Modern designs and construction
   techniques often incorporate sustainability goals by seeking to minimize
   life cycle energy consumption and environmental impact. A well-insulated
   building reduces thermal load on the HVAC system, thus reducing energy
   consumption of the building. Therefore, a sustainably designed building
   is typically a heavily insulated building. In addition to thermal
   resistance characteristics, the choice of insulating material is often
   based on acoustic damping and cost. However; fire safety is generally
   overlooked as a factor for insulation material selection. Few treatments
   have considered how the competing objectives for sustainability and fire
   safety should be assessed when choosing insulation. This paper discusses
   a methodology for balancing' these requirements by evaluating the
   aforementioned attributes of various insulating materials through
   implementation of a weighted mean. Each variable is normalized and then
   weighted according to the emphasis placed on each attribute, using
   experimental data for the relevant material property. Four weighting
   scenarios are presented, each emphasizing a different area of
   consideration: installed cost, fire safety, life-cycle assessment, and
   thermal. Materials considered are cellulose (newspaper), denim (cotton),
   fiberglass, stone wool, polyurethane, and polystyrene. Results of this
   analysis rank the materials in order of desirability and provide a
   method to reorder this ranking based on the priority assigned to each
   attribute. For the weighting scenarios presented herein, stone wool was
   consistently ranked as the best performer; while extruded polystyrene
   was typically the weakest. The intent is that this methodology would be
   informative for designers selecting materials and for planners
   contemplating revised building codes.}},

Abstract = {{A fire contained within a room can spread into void spaces in the walls
   and ceiling through penetrations in the material that lines the
   compartment. Few studies have looked at how a room and contents fire
   transitions to a structural fire. One of the active areas of fire
   research is the coupling of the fire to the structure. Lightweight wood
   frame construction represents the majority of residential construction
   in the U.S. The construction details and choice of materials will affect
   the overall fire resistance of the structure. Because of the relative
   lack of knowledge on the fire penetration into wall spaces, this
   research examined how fire might penetrate into the void spaces of wood
   framed structures.
   In the U.S.A., a critical barrier to the penetration of hot gas products
   into void spaces is provided by the gypsum-board skin of the
   compartment. For most compartments, there are many penetrations within
   the compartment's gypsum-board skin. Common potential access points
   include security system wiring (e.q. smoke detectors and cameras),
   ventilation fixtures, light switches, and electrical outlets among
   others. A hole in the gypsum may create opportunities for void space
   ignition. One of the purposes of this work is to develop a small scale
   testing system to characterize fire driven flow and heat transfer into a
   void space. With such an apparatus, one can rapidly identify materials
   that are prone to igniting for a given leakage geometry and fire size.
   Common materials found in void spaces include wooden structural members,
   plywood/oriented strand board, a variety of insulation types, and vapor
   barriers. This study discusses the characteristics of the small scale
   experimental system and preliminary tests on a range of void space
   construction materials.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes a topology optimization procedure to obtain optimal
   structures which maximize a chosen quantity of interest (QoI).
   Conduction heat transfer is assumed to govern the underlying physics.
   The numerical solution is perfoiined using a finite volume formulation.
   The computational domain is divided into structured quadrilateral or
   hexahedral cells. Associated with each cell is a design variable that is
   intended to be driven to a binary value of either 0 or 1. The binary
   value determines which of two materials fill the cell. Thus the
   optimization problem seeks to find a structure, i.e., a spatial
   distribution of the design variable that maximizes a global QoI under
   specified constraints. A gradient-based optimization technique is
   developed within the framework of the finite volume formulation. We
   demonstrate the efficacy of the technique using a variety of test cases
   specifically for conduction heat transfer applications. The underlying
   procedure is, however, applicable to more general problems involving
   fluid flow and convective thermal transport as well as other physics.}},

Abstract = {{For rehabilitation robots to be successful, a control system that
   results in safe, comfortable and effective interaction between the robot
   and subject is necessary. We present two types of torque-based
   controllers for the index finger module of a hand exoskeleton for
   rehabilitation. Impedance control applies a position-dependent torque at
   the joints, while keeping the interaction with the finger compliant.
   Force-field control, on the other hand, applies a position-dependent
   normal and tangential torques to track a contour in the joint angle
   space. We also present self-guided impedance control wherein hemiparetic
   subjects could guide their impaired hand with their healthy hand by
   using active and passive versions of our device. Experiments with a
   healthy subject showed that the device could render a range of
   impedances from low to high. For accurate trajectory tracking high
   impedance is needed because the inherent finger stiffness varies
   significantly, however, high impedance increases the torque applied when
   the finger motion is impeded. On the contrary, force-field control is
   safer for subjects whose joint show involuntary locking (e.g. spastic
   joints) and does not apply increased torques during stalled motion,
   however, provides limited control over the velocity. These results
   suggest that impedance control would be better suited for therapy where
   the goal is to train for time-critical tasks and force-field control
   would work where coordination between the joints is important.}},

   post-neurological injury due to the anatomical, biomechanical, and

   first step towards validating the new device as a measurement tool, the
   device transparency was assessed through kinematic analysis of a
   redundant finger pointing task requiring synergistic movement of the
   wrist and finger joints. The preliminary results of this new methodology
   showed that wearing the robot affects the kinematic coupling of the
   wrist and finger for unconstrained pointing tasks. However, further
   experiments specifying a subset of the solution manifold did not exhibit
   the same difference between robot and no robot trials. The experiments

Abstract = {{We present a control strategy for the shoulder mechanism of an
   upper-body exoskeleton, called HARMONY, to assist in achieving
   coordinated motion at the shoulder complex. HARMONY is equipped with a
   novel mechanism that supports the natural mobility of the human
   shoulder, including the scapulohumeral rhythm, which is the coordinated
   motion between the upper arm (humerus) and shoulder blade (scapula). The
   key idea of the control strategy is to introduce a coupling torque based
   on impedance corresponding to a reference trajectory of the rhythmic
   motion after compensating for gravity force from the robot. This control
   scheme allows for the variability in the rhythmic motion, while gently
   providing a force to facilitate the scapulohumeral rhythm when the
   shoulder is out of the normal coordinated motion. Experimental results
   show that the coupling torque safely induces the rhythmic motion of the
   shoulder girdle in the presence of abnormal coordinated motion.}},

Abstract = {{Visual discomfort assessment (VDA) on stereoscopic images is of
   fundamental importance for making decisions regarding visual fatigue
   caused by unnatural binocular alignment. Nevertheless, no solid
   framework exists to quantify this discomfort using models of the
   responses of visual neurons. Binocular vision is realized by means of
   neural mechanisms that subserve the sensorimotor control of eye
   movements. We propose a neuronal model-based framework called Neural 3D
   Visual Discomfort Predictor (N3D-VDP) that automatically predicts the
   level of visual discomfort experienced when viewing stereoscopic 3D
   (S3D) images. The N3D-VDP model extracts features derived by estimating
   the neural activity associated with the processing of binocular
   disparities. In this regard we deploy a model of disparity processing in
   the extra-striate middle temporal (MT) region of occipital lobe. We
   compare the performance of N3D-VDP with other recent VDA algorithms
   using correlations against reported subjective visual discomfort, and
   show that N3D-VDP is statistically superior to the other methods.}},

   various industrial processes like steam generation, desalination, and
   nuclear reactor operations. Heat transfer in the film boiling regime is
   significantly reduced as compared to the nucleate boiling regime due to
   the existence of a vapor layer at the solid-liquid interface
   (Leidenfrost effect). This vapor layer degrades heat transfer by up to
   two orders of magnitude and causes dryout, which can result in severe
   temperature excursions. This work maps out the heat transfer benefits of
   electrostatic suppression of the Leidenfrost state. Electrical
   suppression of the Leidenfrost state is observed for a variety of
   liquids, including organic solvents, water and electrically conducting
   salt solutions. Successful Leidenfrost state suppression is observed
   with moderate voltages even at ultrahigh temperatures exceeding 550
   degrees C. Elimination of the vapor layer increases heat dissipation
   capacity of film boiling by more than one order of magnitude; up to 45X
   enhancement was measured in this work. This work also introduces the
   concept of tunable film boiling heat transfer. Overall,
   electrically-enhanced boiling can enable a new class of technologies for
   active control and enhancement of boiling heat transfer, with various
   applications in energy systems.}},

Abstract = {{Electrosurgical dispersive electrodes must safely carry the surgical
   current in monopolar procedures, such as those used in cutting,
   coagulation and radio frequency ablation (RFA). Of these, RFA represents
   the most stringent design constraint since ablation currents are often
   more than 1 to 2 A. (continuous) for several minutes depending on the
   size of the lesion desired and local heat transfer conditions at the
   applicator electrode. This stands in contrast to standard surgical
   activations, which are intermittent, and usually less than 1 Arms, but
   for several seconds at a time. Dispersive electrode temperature rise is
   also critically determined by the sub -surface skin anatomy, thicknesses
   of the subcutaneous and supra -muscular fat, etc.
   Currently, we lack fundamental engineering design criteria that provide
   an estimating framework for preliminary designs of these electrodes. The
   lack of a fundamental design framework means that a large number of
   experiments must be conducted in order to establish a reasonable design.
   Previously, an attempt to correlate maximum temperatures in experimental
   work with the average current density -time product failed to yield a
   good match. This paper develops and applies a new measure of an
   electrode stress parameter that correlates well with both the previous
   experimental data and with numerical models of other electrode shapes.
   The finite element method (FEM) model work was calibrated against
   experimental RF lesions in porcine skin to establish the fundamental
   principle underlying dispersive electrode performance. The results can
   be used in preliminary electrode design calculations, experiment series
   design and performance evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{A large wireless network with energy harvesting transmitters is
   considered, where a group of K transmitters form a cluster to
   cooperatively serve a desired user. Using stochastic geometry, simple
   closed-form expressions are derived to characterize the outage
   performance as a function of important parameters such as the energy
   harvesting rate, buffer size and cluster size for a given cluster
   geometry. The developed framework also allows the K in-cluster
   transmitters to have different energy harvesting capabilities. A
   comparison with simulation results reveals that the derived expressions
   closely model the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio distribution at
   the receiver, particularly in the low-outage regime. Lastly, the
   developed framework is used to investigate the impact of different
   parameters such as cluster and buffer size on outage performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper characterizes the performance of multi-user joint
   transmission (MU-JT) with pair-wise dynamic base station (BS)
   clustering. For analyzing the performance of such BS cooperation method,
   a tractable model is presented by means of stochastic geometry. Using
   tools of stochastic geometry, a tight lower bound of the instantaneous
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) distribution is derived in a closed
   form in terms of relevant system parameters: the path-loss exponent and
   the topologies of users in the BS cooperative region. Our key finding is
   that the pair-wise dynamic BS cooperation through MU-JT provides a
   better rate coverage performance than that of single-user joint
   transmission (SU-JT) over the entire range of the rate threshold when
   each user is close enough to the associated BS. Through simulations, the
   exactness of the derived analytical expression is verified.}},

   access channels (IMAC) with the delayed channel state information at the

   increase the sum-DoF compared to the case of no CSIT. The key idea is to
   align multiple interfering signals from adjacent cells onto a small
   dimensional subspace over time by fully exploiting the previously
   received signals as side information with outdated CSIT in a distributed
   manner. Remarkably, we show that the retrospective interference
   alignment can achieve the optimal sum-DoF in the context of two-cell
   two-user scenario by providing a new outer bound.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the interplay between massive MIMO and
   device-to-device (D2D) networking in a single cell setting, where
   cellular uplink resources are shared by D2D. The spatial positions of
   underlaid D2D transmitters are modeled by a Poisson point process. All
   the transmissions (both cellular and D2D) are SIMO (i. e., single-input
   multiple-output) with the base station (BS) having a very large antenna
   array. Assuming perfect channel state information at the receivers, we
   study cellular and D2D spectral efficiency. In the asymptotic regime
   where the number of BS antennas goes to infinity, we find that the
   received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of any cellular
   user increases unboundedly and the effects of noise, fast fading, and
   the interfering signals from the other co-channel cellular users and the
   infinite D2D transmitters vanish completely. In the non-asymptotic
   regime, we derive simple analytical lower bounds for both cellular and
   D2D spectral efficiency, which allow for efficient numerical evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files have gained wide
   acceptance by transit agencies, which now provide them for most major
   metropolitan areas. The public availability GTFSs combined with the
   convenience of presenting a standard data representation has promoted
   the development of numerous applications for their use. Whereas most of
   these tools are focused on the analysis and utilization of public
   transportation systems, GTFS data sets are also extremely relevant for
   the development of multimodal planning models. The use of GTFS data for
   integrated modeling requires creating a graph of the public
   transportation network that is consistent with the roadway network. The
   former is not trivial, given limitations of networks often used for
   regional planning models and the complexity of the roadway system. A
   proposed open-source algorithm matches GTFS geographic information to
   existing planning networks and is also relevant for real-time in-field
   applications. The methodology is based on maintaining a set of candidate
   paths connecting successive geographic points. Examples of
   implementations using traditional planning networks and a network built
   from crowdsourced OpenStreetMap data are presented. The versatility of
   the methodology is also demonstrated by using it for matching GPS points
   from a navigation system. Experimental results suggest that this
   approach is highly successful even when the underlying roadway network
   is not complete. The proposed methodology is a promising step toward
   using novel and inexpensive data sources to facilitate and eventually
   transform the way that transportation models are built and validated.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in soft sensors using microfluidic liquid conductors
   enabled sensing of large deformation of soft structures. However, the
   use of liquids as conductive media carries a risk of leakage in many
   cases. Furthermore, it could be harmful when exposed to the human body
   in certain applications. To address these issues, a different sensing
   mechanism was proposed: highly stretchable optical sensors that could
   detect multiple modes of deformation. The method of operation involves a
   simple waveguide and its housing which are both made of silicone
   elastomer. The soft waveguide is coated with a thin gold reflective
   layer to encapsulate light propagating internally, with an
   light-emitting diode ( LED) and a photodiode embedded at each end. When
   the sensor is stretched, compressed, or bent, micro-cracks within the
   reflective layer form and allow part of the light to escape, resulting
   in optical power losses in the light transmission. In this paper, we
   describe the design and fabrication of the proposed soft sensors. A
   prototype was created and characterized for pressure, strain, and
   curvature up to 350 kPa, 90\%, and 0.12 mm(-1), respectively, showing
   promising results of reasonable repeatability and linearity in certain
   ranges.}},

   to achieve ideal all-angle negative refraction and planar focusing are
   implemented using realistic structures, e. g., suitably designed

   several of the limitations of negative-index lenses, and offers
   fundamentally superior imaging properties compared to conventional

   nanoribbons, which are efficiently designed taking advantage of the
   quasi-static nature of graphene surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in
   nanostructures. Spatial dispersion in graphene sheets is then reviewed.
   This effect is closely related to the quantum capacitance of graphene
   and can be modelled with an equivalent circuit able to accurately
   predict the complex propagation constant of the supported SPPs. The
   practical implications of this phenomenon regarding THz graphene-based
   plasmonic devices are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of surface plasmons supported by infinitesimally thin
   hyperbolic metasurfaces are investigated in detail. Hyperbolic
   metasurfaces are rigorously modelled using uniaxial conductivity
   tensors, thus taking into account their combined dielectric/metallic
   nature. The dispersion relation of the supported modes is analytically
   derived and asymptotically simplified to closely follow the branches of
   the TM hyperbolic isofrequency contour. The features of the supported
   plasmons include i) an ideally infinite field confinement, limited in
   practice by the presence of losses and the periodicity of the engineered
   structure, and ii) propagation along specific directions within the
   sheet, which can be controlled by manipulating the components of the
   metasurface conductivity tensor. We envision that hyperbolic
   metasurfaces may find application in guided plasmonic devices, enhancing
   the spontaneous emission rate of emitters, imaging and sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear metasurfaces based on coupling locallyenhanced plasmonic
   response to intersubband transitions of multi-quantum-wells have
   recently provided second-order susceptibilities several orders of
   magnitude larger than any other non-linear flat structure measured so
   far. Here, we demonstrate that a proper design of the plasmonic
   metasurface inclusions can dramatically enhance the overall non-linear
   response of the structure. The optimized metasurfaces are then applied
   to achieve efficient second-harmonic generation (SHG) and differential
   frequency generation (DFG) in the infrared and terahertz frequency
   bands, respectively. In case of low-power impinging beams (approximate
   to 1W), our simulations predict large conversion efficiencies of around
   0.8\% and 0.01\% for SHG and DFG, outperforming previously reported
   efficiencies in 1-2 orders magnitude and confirming the suitability of
   this type of plasmonic metasurfaces as a highly-efficient flat platform
   for non-linear photonics.}},

Abstract = {{A coordinated cyber-attack on grid meter readings and breaker statuses
   can lead to incorrect state estimation that can subsequently destabilize
   the grid. This paper studies cyber-attacks by an adversary that changes
   breaker statuses on transmission lines to affect the estimation of the
   grid topology. The adversary, however, is incapable of changing the
   value of any meter data and can only block recorded measurements on
   certain lines from being transmitted to the control center. The proposed
   framework, with limited resource requirements as compared to standard
   data attacks, thus extends the scope of cyber-attacks to grids secure
   from meter corruption. We discuss necessary and sufficient conditions
   for feasible attacks using a novel graph-coloring based analysis and
   show that an optimal attack requires breaker status change at only ONE
   transmission line. The potency of our attack regime is demonstrated

Abstract = {{A widespread integration of residential photovoltaics (PVs) into the
   distribution system may potentially disrupt the nominal circuit
   operating conditions and result in power quality issues. The objective
   of this paper is to investigate the impacts of residential PVs on
   distribution voltages. A stochastic analysis framework is used to
   simulate possible PV deployment scenarios. The PV integration limit,
   termed hosting capacity, is calculated with respect to bus overvoltages,
   voltage deviations, and voltage unbalance. A thorough interpretation of
   PV hosting results is presented, and several factors potentially
   affecting the circuit's voltage quality are identified. Additionally,
   the impacts of increasing the circuit's minimum load on the PV hosting
   capacity are evaluated. Finally, the voltage quality impacts of PV
   locations are identified, and, based on the results, useful and generic
   recommendations for PV integration are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In distribution power system, an active power filter (APF) is installed
   at the point of common coupling (PCC) bus to eliminate harmonic currents
   injected by non-linear loads. The active power filter, therefore, needs
   to synchronize with the grid by employing a
   second-order-generalized-integrator frequency-locked loop (SOGI-FLL) to
   detect the positive-sequence voltage component. If the grid is highly
   distorted by harmonic currents, it degrades the accuracy of SOGI-FLL
   estimation and the APF cannot get correct grid voltage characteristics.
   This paper introduces a new grid synchronization structure based on the
   SOGI-FLL under distorted voltage condition. The proposed structure
   behaves as a high-order filter to completely remove harmonic components
   and inherits advantages from SOGI-FLL. The grid voltage magnitude and
   frequency, thus, are detected precisely under distorted grid. Simulation
   results are presented to verify the proposed system performances.}},

Abstract = {{The orbit determination process, such as that used for the Gravity
   Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), is highly dependent upon the
   comparison of measured observables with computed values, derived from
   mathematical models relating the satellites' numerically integrated
   state to the observable. Significant errors in the computed state
   corrupt this comparison and induce errors in the least squares estimate
   of the satellites' states, as well as the gravity field. Due to the high
   accuracy of the inter-satellite ranging measurements from GRACE,
   numerical computations must mitigate errors to maintain a similar level
   of accuracy. One error source is the presence of round off errors in the
   computed inter-satellite range-rate when integrating continuous,
   smoothly varying accelerations with double precision arithmetic. These
   errors occur at approximately 8 pm/s RMS and limit the accuracy of
   numerically integrating background gravity field models to degree/order
   260 and 410, for satellite pairs flying at altitudes of 500 and 300
   kilometers respectively. In addition, errors due to inaccurate modeling
   of transient accelerations, which occur on time scales much smaller than
   the integration step size, may contaminate computed satellite
   trajectories. For GRACE, these errors arise due to minute inaccuracies
   in the firing of the spacecrafts' attitude thrusters. Mis-modeling of
   these accelerations induce errors at approximately 10 nm/s in
   range-rate; becoming a limitation as more advanced inter-satellite
   measurement techniques approach this level of accuracy.}},

   need for accurate and fast collision probability computations. Gaussian
   Mixture Models (GMMs) provide a compromise between accuracy and runtime
   by better approximating the true non-Gaussian distributions during
   conjunction. In this study, the use of Multidirectional GMMs (MGMMs) to
   improve the collision probability accuracy in cases that are highly
   non-Gaussian is proposed. A method for identifying important splitting
   directions using the second order divided difference is presented. The
   selection of the directions and number of splits along relevant
   direction provides a dial that spans from Monte Carlo to the classic
   Gaussian approximation. The MGMM method is formulated and successfully
   demonstrated using several test cases with non-Gaussian uncertainty

Abstract = {{In this paper we address a problem where limited sensor resources must
   be used in an efficient manner during short-duration events for
   situational assessment and mitigation of threats arising from a cluster
   of unknown sub-orbital space objects. Many of these target space objects
   may be too small to survive atmosphere entry. Additionally, many other
   objects may be on a path to hit remote locations, too far from
   population centers to pose any threat. The sensor resource management
   (SRM) goal is to allocate sensor resources to i) track various targets,
   ii) make a determination of threat targets vs non-threat targets, and
   iii) support a threat engagement by ground-based interceptors by
   providing required quality of track estimation within a time bound. The
   SRM approach presented in this paper includes prioritization of sensor
   tasks based on situation awareness analysis. Information-theory-based
   sensor allocation is implemented to maximize expected information gain
   under the measurement constraints, defined by finite sensor capabilities
   and sensor-target geometry.}},

Abstract = {{It is expected that a non-trivial percentage of small bodies that future
   missions may visit are tumbling in non-principal axis rotation. An
   Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
   (SLAM) method is used to estimate the small body spin state with optical
   landmark measurements, as well-as the spacecraft position, velocity,
   attitude, and surface landmark locations. An example scenario based on
   the Rosetta mission is used, with a tumbling small body. The SLAM method
   proves effective, with order of magnitude decreases in the spacecraft
   and small body spin state errors after less than a quarter of the comet
   characterization phase. Initial small body angular velocity errors can
   be several times larger than the true rates, and the SLAM method will
   still converge (effectively having no apriori knowledge of the angular
   velocity). It is also observed that higher levels of tumbling in the
   small body increase the spin state angular velocity estimation errors
   and decrease the moments of inertia error, as expected.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical inclusion of high degree zonal gravity harmonics and solar
   radiation pressure enables heliotropic orbits to be found at irregular
   primitive bodies like Bennu, the target of the OSIRIS-REx mission.
   Heliotropic orbits provide long-lifetime, low-altitude orbits in the
   presence of these significant perturbations. Using a constrained,
   doubly-averaged disturbing potential in the Lagrange Planetary Equations
   yields inclined heliotropic orbits as well as a method for assessing the
   likelihood of a heliotropic orbit existing in an uncertain environment.
   The existence of heliotropic orbits is shown to be robust to uncertainty
   in the gravity parameters of a model of Bennu, and an example orbit
   shows how heliotropic orbits persist in the presence of other gravity
   perturbations as well.}},

Abstract = {{Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are
   combined in a hybrid fashion to quantify state uncertainty for
   spacecraft. The PCE approach models the uncertainty by performing an
   expansion using orthogonal polynomials (OPs). The accuracy of PCE for a
   given problem can be improved by increasing the order of the OP
   expansion. Due to the ``curse of dimensionality{''} the number of terms
   in the OP expansion increases exponentially with dimensionality of the
   problem, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the PCE approach for
   problems of moderately high dimensionality. Including a GMM with the PCE
   (GMM-PC) is shown to reduce the overall order required to achieve a
   desired accuracy. The initial distribution is converted into a GMM, and
   PCE is used to propagate each of the elements. Splitting the initial
   distribution into a GMM reduces the size of the covariance associated
   with each element and therefore, lower order polynomials can be used.
   The GMM-PC effectively reduces the function evaluations required for
   accurately describing a non-Gaussian distribution that results from the
   propagation of a state with an initial Gaussian distribution through a
   nonlinear function. Several examples of state uncertainty are propagated
   using GMM-PC. The resulting distributions are shown to efficiently
   capture shape and skewness.}},

Abstract = {{While human-like series passive compliance has been used in previous
   robotic hand designs, little attention has been paid to parallel passive
   compliance due to the lack of understanding of its importance in
   grasping and manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel design of
   compliant finger inspired by biomechanical features and functionality of
   human hands. We develop a human-like compact joint by optimizing the
   geometry of a compliant material and mechanical elements. The joint
   exhibits a passive double exponential torque matching human-like
   compliance. We implement the compliant joint into a robotic finger
   design with human-like tendon routings. We carry out a series of
   experiments on the finger design with an open-loop control strategy in
   grasping and manipulation. The results show that the fingers perform
   reliable grasping and manipulation without feedback. We validate the
   trajectory tracking with a motion capture system. The human-like
   compliant fingers follow the desired trajectories with small errors
   (less than 1 cm). The innovative finger design realizes the human-like
   hand passive properties and achieves human-like grasping capability.}},

   drooped linearly with respect to the load current supplied by each of
   the converters. To compensate for the voltage deviations without
   affecting current sharing, the droop control is augmented by a
   secondary/voltage regulating control. Asymptotic stability of the
   equilibrium point with the proposed control input is examined using
   Lyapunov and conditions to ensure local asymptotic stability of the
   equilibrium points are derived. Simulations and experimental results are

   Practical solutions to mitigate EV load impacts are discussed as well,
   including infrastructural changes and indirect controlled charging with
   time-of-use (TOU) pricing. An optimal TOU schedule is also presented,
   with the aim of maximizing both customer and utility benefits. This
   paper also presents a discussion on implementing smart charging
   algorithms to directly control EV charging rates and EV charging
   starting times. Finally, a controlled charging algorithm is proposed to
   improve the voltage quality at the EV load locations while avoiding
   customer inconvenience. The proposed method significantly decreases the
   impacts of EV load charging on system peak load demand and feeder

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2493}},
Pages = {{29-38}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may significantly change traveler behavior and
   network congestion. Empty repositioning trips allow travelers to avoid
   parking fees or share the vehicle with other household members. Computer
   precision and reaction times may also increase road and intersection
   capacities. AVs are currently being test driven on public roads and may
   be publicly available within the next two decades; they therefore may be
   within the span of 20- to 30-year planning analyses. Despite this time
   scale, AV behavior has yet to be incorporated into planning models. This
   paper presents a multiclass, four-step model that includes AV
   repositioning to avoid parking fees (although incurring additional fuel
   costs) and increases in link capacity as a function of the proportion of
   AVs on the link. Demand is divided into classes by value of time and AV
   ownership. Mode choice-parking, repositioning, or transit-is determined
   through a nested logit model. Traffic assignment is based on a
   generalized cost function of time, fuel, and tolls. The results on a
   city network show that transit ridership decreases and the number of
   personal vehicle trips sharply increases as a result of repositioning.
   However, increases in link capacity offset the additional congestion.
   Although link volume increases significantly, only modest decreases in
   average link speeds are observed.}},

Title = {{Latent-Segmentation-Based Approach to Investigating Spatial
   Transferability of Activity-Travel Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2493}},
Pages = {{136-144}},
Abstract = {{Spatial transferability of travel demand models has been an issue of
   considerable interest, particularly for small- and medium-sized planning
   areas that often do not have the resources and staff time to collect
   large-scale travel survey data and estimate model components native to
   the region. Traditional approaches to identifying geographic contexts
   that may borrow and transfer models between one another involve the
   exogenous a priori identification of a set of variables used to
   characterize the similarity between geographic regions. However, this ad
   hoc procedure presents considerable challenges because it is difficult
   to identify the most appropriate criteria a priori. To address that
   issue, this paper proposes a latent segmentation approach: the most
   appropriate criteria for identifying areas with similar profiles are
   determined endogenously in the model estimation phase. The end products
   are a set of optimal criteria for clustering regions as well as a fully
   transferred model, segmented to account for heterogeneity in the
   population. The method is demonstrated, and its efficacy established
   through a case study in this paper that uses the National Household
   Travel Survey data set for information on weekday activities of
   nonworkers in nine regions in the states of California and Florida. The
   estimated model is then applied to a context withheld from the original
   estimation to assess its performance. The method is found to offer a
   robust mechanism for identifying latent segments and establishing
   criteria for transferring models between areas.}},

Abstract = {{Modern SoCs and microprocessors, e.g., those in smart phones and
   laptops, typically have multiple operating conditions, such as video
   streaming, web browsing, standby, and so on. They will have different
   performance targets and run under different supply voltages. Gate sizing
   (with threshold voltage assignment) is a fundamental step for
   power/performance optimization. However, conventional gate sizing
   algorithms only consider one scenario, e.g., the performance-critical
   operating condition, which may be over-design for other operating
   conditions. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of gate sizing,
   OSFA (One-Size-Fits-All), which performs power/performance optimizations
   across multiple operating conditions. Based on OSFA, we also adjust the
   supply voltage targeting overall power optimization. Experimental
   results on industry-strength benchmarks demonstrate that compared with
   conventional approach OSFA could provide an average 6.1\% reduction in
   power without performance loss.}},

Abstract = {{Model order reduction exploiting the spectral properties of the
   admittance matrix, known as the graph Laplacian, to control the
   approximation accuracy is a promising new class of approaches to power
   grid analysis. In this paper we introduce a method that allows a
   dramatic increase in the resulting graph sparsity and can handle large
   dense input graphs. The method is based on the observation that the
   information about the realistic ranges of port currents can be used to
   significantly improve the resulting graph sparsity. In practice, port
   currents cannot vary unboundedly and the estimates of peak currents are
   often available early in the design cycle. However, the existing methods
   including the sampling-based spectral sparsification approach {[}11]
   cannot utilize this information.
   We propose a novel framework of graph Sparsification by L1
   regularization on Laplacians (SparseLL) to exploit the available range
   information to achieve a higher degree of sparsity and better
   approximation quality. By formulating the power grid reduction as a
   sparsity-inducing optimization problem, we leverage the recent progress
   in stochastic approximation and develop a stochastic gradient descent
   algorithm as an efficient solution.
   Using established benchmarks for experiments, we demonstrate that
   SparseLL can achieve an up to 10X edge sparsity improvement compared to
   the spectral sparsification approach assuming the full range of
   currents, with an up to 10X accuracy improvement. The running time of
   our algorithm also scales quite favorably due to the low complexity and
   fast convergence, which leads us to believe that our algorithm is highly
   suitable for large-scale dense problems.}},

Abstract = {{Maximizing energy capture during wind turbine operation plays a crucial
   role in increasing wind energy's economic viability and its penetration
   in the grid. Variable speed operation enables the turbine to extract
   more energy during partial load operation or Region 2 operation. Various
   control algorithms have been developed to maximize the benefit of using
   variable ratio operation. However, the existing control methods cannot
   provide the knowledge of the maximum wind energy that can be captured
   and the efficiency gap between an optimal control design and these
   methods. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the application of
   optimal control methods. This paper presents a numerical optimal control
   (NOC) technique to maximize wind energy capture for Region 2 operation
   of a wind turbine system. Mitigating turbine torque variation, thus
   reducing the fatigue loading of a turbine drivetrain, is also considered
   in the control design. Furthermore, an approach of incorporating
   time-varying weightings into developing the optimal controller is
   introduced to seek further improvement on turbine torque reduction. The
   performance of the proposed control technique is compared to traditional
   control strategies in a simulation environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses output feedback stabilization of fully actuated
   rigid-body attitude dynamics in the presence of unknown point-wise
   time-delay in the input torque. Specifically, rate-gyros are unavailable
   here and only the attitude state represented by the unit quaternion is
   assumed to be measured. In the absence of time-delay, it is well known
   that linear asymptotically stabilizing control laws can be derived for
   this problem using the passivity properties of the system. The presence
   of unknown time-delay in the measured variables, however, imposes
   formidable technical challenges for the output-feedback attitude
   stabilization problem on hand. One of the central difficulties stems
   from the availability of only a weak Lyapunov-like function for the
   passivity based dynamic output feedback controller in the absence of
   delay. This obstacle is circumvented in this paper by a novel process of
   partially strictifying the underlying weak Lyapunov-like function. This
   step lends itself very nicely toward the subsequent definition of a
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii type functional when unknown time-delay is
   introduced within the feedback. The paper concludes with a closed-loop
   stability analysis that includes a rigorous characterization for the
   region of attraction as a function of the initial angular speed and the
   magnitude of the time-delay.}},

   elastic anisotropy and plasticity are considered for each Cu grain, and
   the grain orientation obtained from experimental measurements is
   directly mapped into the FEA model. GBS is described by a cohesive zone
   model based on a frictional traction separation relationship. Based on
   GBS, the via extrusion behavior is deduced for two different Cu/Si
   interfacial conditions: fully bonded and free sliding, corresponding to
   the upper and lower bounds of the extrusion. In each case, the effect of
   GBS is evaluated by analyzing the plasticity and extrusion profiles. The

Abstract = {{We consider the optimal scheduling problem for a large-scale parallel
   server system with one large pool of statistically identical servers and
   multiple classes of jobs under the expected long-run average (ergodic)
   cost criterion. Jobs of each class arrive as a Poisson process, are
   served in the FCFS discipline within each class and may elect to abandon
   while waiting in their queue. The service and abandonment rates are both
   class-dependent. Assume that the system is operating in the Halfin-Whitt
   regime, where the arrival rates and the number of servers grow
   appropriately so that the system gets critically loaded while the
   service and abandonment rates are fixed. The optimal solution is
   obtained via the ergodic diffusion control problem in the limit, which
   forms a new class of problems in the literature of ergodic controls. A
   new theoretical framework is provided to solve this class of ergodic
   control problems. The proof of the convergence of the values of the
   multiclass parallel server system to that of the diffusion control
   problem relies on a new approximation method, spatial truncation, where
   the Markov policies follow a fixed priority policy outside a fixed

Abstract = {{A UWB transceiver that employs pulsed, multiband signaling with
   frequency-hopping is demonstrated in a 65nm CMOS process. The
   transceiver satisfies ECC requirements and operates in the frequency
   range 6-8.5 GHz. The proposed signaling scheme provides flexibility to
   satisfy regulations across multiple regions with low implementation
   complexity. The receiver employs 4-element beamforming at IF to enhance
   sensitivity. The beamforming architecture does not require a wideband
   delay circuit at the RX. The prototype demonstrates 1 Gbps data rate
   over 2 meters, while consuming 221 mW in the TX and 211 mW in the
   receiver.}},

Abstract = {{In the late 1400' s, Leonardo da Vinci (Reynal \& Company, 1956) advised
   his future readers to study the science of machines to reduce the burden
   (drudgery) on humanity. Today, the question remains-what technologies
   can best meet the needs of mankind (Asimov \& Frenkel, 1985; Beleyania,
   1983; Caswell \& Gossain, 1987; Hirzinger, 1997; IFREMER (The French
   Institute Of Research And Exploration Of The Sea), 1996; Jacobsen et
   al., 1984; Jacobson, 1996; Lowe, 1985; Morecki et al., 1971; Tesar \&
   Butler, 1989; Volpe, 1996; Weisbin, 1997)? This paper will outline the
   ability of the discipline of mechanical engineering to satisfy a
   spectrum of these needs and its potential to match the excitement and
   vitality of its neighboring disciplines (electronics, computer science,
   etc.). First, a representative selection of needs will be described
   along with a listing of technologies (present and future) that may be
   associated with the discipline of mechanical engineering. Second, a
   matrix of these needs and technologies will be used to establish the
   relative importance of the discipline's development capacity and to
   prioritize five possible future areas for development of
   multi-disciplinary programs. Third, the critical role of the intelligent
   actuator as a basic building block of the Next Wave of Technology (NWT)
   will be described in terms of five classes of actuator technology. Then,
   the NWT will be described briefly in terms of its ten primary technical
   components and illustrated in terms of a brief description of open
   architecture vehicles of the future.}},

Abstract = {{Infrared neural stimulation (INS) is a neurostimulation modality that
   uses pulsed infrared light to evoke artifact-free, spatially precise
   neural activity with a noncontact interface; however, the technique has
   not been demonstrated in humans. The objective of this study is to
   demonstrate the safety and efficacy of INS in humans in vivo. The
   feasibility of INS in humans was assessed in patients (n = 7) undergoing
   selective dorsal root rhizotomy, where hyperactive dorsal roots,
   identified for transection, were stimulated in vivo with INS on two to
   three sites per nerve with electromyogram recordings acquired throughout
   the stimulation. The stimulated dorsal root was removed and histology
   was performed to determine thermal damage thresholds of INS. Threshold
   activation of human dorsal rootlets occurred in 63\% of nerves for
   radiant exposures between 0.53 and 1.23 J/cm(2). In all cases, only one
   or two monitored muscle groups were activated from INS stimulation of a
   hyperactive spinal root identified by electrical stimulation. Thermal
   damage was first noted at 1.09 J/cm(2) and a 2: 1 safety ratio was
   identified. These findings demonstrate the success of INS as a fresh
   approach for activating human nerves in vivo and providing the necessary
   safety data needed to pursue clinically driven therapeutic and
   diagnostic applications of INS in humans. (C) 2015 Society of
