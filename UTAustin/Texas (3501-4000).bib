Abstract = {{Renewable alternatives for petroleum-derived chemicals are achievable
   through biosynthetic production. Here, we utilize Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae to enable the synthesis of itaconic acid, a molecule with
   diverse applications as a petrochemical replacement. We first optimize
   pathway expression within S. cerevisiae through the use of a hybrid
   promoter. Next, we utilize sequential, in silico computational
   genome-scanning to identify beneficial genetic perturbations that are
   metabolically distant from the itaconic acid synthesis pathway. In this
   manner, we successfully identify three non-obvious genetic targets (a
   dagger ade3 a dagger bna2 a dagger tes1) that successively improve
   itaconic acid titer. We establish that focused manipulations of upstream
   pathway enzymes (localized refactoring) and enzyme re-localization to
   both mitochondria and cytosol fail to improve itaconic acid titers.
   Finally, we establish a higher cell density fermentation that ultimately
   achieves itaconic acid titer of 168 mg/L, a sevenfold improvement over
   initial conditions. This work represents an attempt to increase itaconic
   acid production in yeast and demonstrates the successful utilization of
   computationally guided genetic manipulation to increase metabolic
   capacity.}},

Title = {{How Does Ankle-foot Orthosis Stiffness Affect Gait in Patients With
   Lower Limb Salvage?}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are commonly prescribed during rehabilitation
   after limb salvage. AFO stiffness is selected to help mitigate gait
   deficiencies. A new custom dynamic AFO, the Intrepid Dynamic Exoskeletal
   Orthosis (IDEO), is available to injured service members but
   prescription guidelines are limited.
   In this study we ask (1) does dynamic AFO stiffness affect gait
   parameters such as joint angles, moments, and powers; and (2) can a
   given dynamic AFO stiffness normalize gait mechanics to noninjured
   control subjects?
   Thirteen patients with lower limb salvage (ankle arthrodesis,
   neuropathy, foot/ankle reconstruction, etc) after major lower extremity
   trauma and 13 control subjects who had no lower extremity trauma and
   wore no orthosis underwent gait analysis at a standardized speed.
   Patients wore their custom IDEO with posterior struts of three different
   stiffnesses: nominal (clinically prescribed stiffness), compliant (20\%
   less stiff), and stiff (20\% stiffer). Joint angles, moments, powers,
   and ground reaction forces were compared across the varying stiffnesses
   of the orthoses tested and between the patient and control groups.
   An increase in AFO compliance resulted in 20\% to 26\% less knee flexion
   relative to the nominal (p = 0.003) and stiff (p = 0.001) conditions,
   respectively. Ankle range of motion and power generation were, on
   average, 56\% (p < 0.001) and 63\% (p < 0.001), respectively, less than
   controls as a result of the relatively fixed ankle position.
   Patients with limb salvage readily adapted to different dynamic AFO
   stiffnesses and demonstrated few biomechanical differences among
   conditions during walking. None of the stiffness conditions normalized
   gait to controls.
   The general lack of differences across a 40\% range of strut stiffness
   suggests that orthotists do not need to invest large amounts of time
   identifying optimal device stiffness for patients who use dynamic AFOs
   for low-impact activities such as walking. However, choosing a stiffer
   strut may more readily translate to higher-impact activities and offer
   less chance of mechanical failure.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an algorithm for modeling saturated fractures in a
   poroelastic domain in which the reservoir simulator is coupled with a
   boundary element method. A fixed stress splitting is used on the
   underlying fractured Biot system to iteratively couple fluid and solid
   mechanics systems. The fluid system consists of Darcy's law in the
   reservoir and is computed with a multipoint flux mixed finite element
   method, and a Reynolds' lubrication equation in the fracture solved with
   a mimetic finite difference method. The mechanics system consists of
   linear elasticity in the reservoir and is computed with a continuous
   Galerkin method, and linear elasticity in the fracture is solved with a
   weakly singular symmetric Galerkin boundary element method. This
   algorithm is able to compute both unknown fracture width and unknown
   fluid leakage rate. An interesting numerical example is presented with
   an injection well inside of a circular fracture.}},

Abstract = {{Retail buildings have a potential for both short-term (customer) and
   long-term (occupational) exposure to indoor pollutants. However, little
   is known about volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations in the
   retail sector and influencing factors, such as ventilation, in-store
   activities, and store type. We measured VOC concentrations and
   ventilation rates in 14 retail stores in Texas and Pennsylvania. With
   the exception of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, VOCs were present in
   retail stores at concentrations well below health guidelines. Indoor
   formaldehyde concentrations ranged from 4.6ppb to 67ppb. The two
   mid-sized grocery stores in the sample had the highest levels of ethanol
   and acetaldehyde, with concentrations up to 2.6ppm and 92ppb,
   respectively, possibly due to the preparation of dough and baking
   activities. Indoor-to-outdoor concentration ratios indicated that indoor
   sources were the main contributors to indoor VOC concentrations for the
   majority of compounds. There was no strong correlation between
   ventilation and VOC concentrations across all stores. However,
   increasing the air exchange rates at two stores led to lower indoor VOC
   concentrations, suggesting that ventilation can be used to reduce
   concentrations for some specific stores.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue life of ultrasonically welded lithium-ion battery tab joints
   is studied for electric and hybrid-electric vehicle (EV and HEV)
   applications. Similar to metallic materials, the electrical resistance
   of these ultrasonic welds strongly depends on their quality and the
   crack growth under fatigue loading. A fatigue life model is developed
   using the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) formulation, where the damage
   variable is defined using the electrical resistance of ultrasonic welds.
   Fatigue tests under various loading conditions are conducted with
   aluminum-copper battery tab joints made under various ultrasonic welding
   conditions. It is shown that the electrical resistance of ultrasonic
   welds increases characteristically during the fatigue life test. There
   is a threshold for the damage variable, after which the ultrasound welds
   fail rapidly. Due to welding process variation, welds made under the
   same process settings may have different fatigue performance. This
   quality difference may be classified using two parameters estimated from
   the fatigue life model. By monitoring the electrical resistance, it is
   possible to predict the remaining life of ultrasonically welded battery
   tab joints using only a portion of the fatigue test data. The prediction
   is more reliable by incorporating data beyond the half-life of the
   joints during the fatigue test.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that the evolution of building information
   modeling (BIM) is increasingly affecting the roles of construction
   management professionals in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry. Since the transition from 2D drafting to
   BIM is more of a process transformation, the use of BIM also affects how
   information is managed by and for construction management professionals.
   Teaching BIM in construction engineering and management (CEM) curriculum
   requires more emphasis on learning BIM as a process improvement
   methodology rather than only a technology. This paper describes the
   implementation of a graduate level course called ``Building Information
   Modeling for Capital Projects{''} that was developed to educate
   next-generation construction managers to understand BIM and effectively
   use an existing BIM in plan execution for building construction
   projects. This is a project-based course where students gain knowledge
   on the implementation of BIM concepts throughout the life cycle of a
   building. A process-oriented teaching approach was applied in the course
   and is introduced in the paper. Findings and lessons learned to date
   from the teaching experience are documented. (C) 2014 American Society

Abstract = {{Diagnosis of hypertension and clinical decisions regarding its treatment
   are typically based upon daytime clinic blood pressure (BP)
   measurements, occasionally supplemented by wake-time patient
   self-assessment. Yet, correlation between BP level and target organ
   damage, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and long-term prognosis is
   higher for ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) measurements. Numerous
   studies consistently reveal CVD events are better predicted by the
   asleep than awake or 24 h BP means. In addition, when the asleep BP mean
   is adjusted by the awake mean, only the former is a significant
   independent predictor of outcome. Endogenous circadian rhythms explain
   statistically and clinically significant ingestion time differences in
   efficacy, duration of action, safety and/or effects on the daily BP
   pattern of most hypertension medications and their combinations. Bedtime
   versus morning-time ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme
   inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, independent of drug
   terminal half-life, both better reduces asleep BP and normalizes the
   daily BP profile into a more normal dipper pattern. The recently
   completed prospective outcome MAPEC Study verifies therapeutic
   restoration of the normal sleep-time BP decline, a novel therapeutic
   goal most effectively achieved by ingestion of the entire daily dose of
   >= 1 conventional hypertension medications at bedtime, best decreases
   CVD morbidity and mortality. Our findings indicate around-the-clock ABPM
   is a clinical necessity to accurately detect abnormal sleep-time BP and
   assess CVD risk, and that hypertension ought to be managed by a bedtime
   therapeutic strategy, preferably one including medication that
   antagonizes the activities and actions of the
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.}},

Abstract = {{FFT algorithms have memory access patterns that prevent many
   architectures from achieving high computational utilization,
   particularly when parallel processing is required to achieve the desired
   levels of performance. Starting with a highly efficient hybrid linear
   algebra/FFT core, we co-design the on-chip memory hierarchy, on-chip
   interconnect, and FFT algorithms for a multicore FFT processor. We show
   that it is possible to to achieve excellent parallel scaling while
   maintaining power and area efficiency comparable to that of the
   single-core solution. The result is an architecture that can effectively
   use up to 16 hybrid cores for transform sizes that can be contained in
   on-chip SRAM. When configured with 12MiB of on-chip SRAM, our technology
   evaluation shows that the proposed 16-core FFT accelerator should
   sustain 388 GFLOPS of nominal double-precision performance, with power
   and area efficiencies of 30 GFLOPS/W and 2.66 GFLOPS/mm(2),

Abstract = {{The vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) will enable networked
   environments populated with vast amounts of data that can be exploited
   by humans. The volume of digitally available data in such emerging
   computing spaces presents an imminent need for search mechanisms that
   enable humans and applications to find relevant information within their
   digitally accessible physical surroundings. This paper presents Gander,
   a search engine for these pervasive computing spaces enabled by the IoT
   and characterized by large volumes of highly transient data. Gander is
   founded on a novel conceptual model of search that resolves queries
   about a user's here and now by leveraging proximally available resources
   in the here and now. We formally describe the model underlying Gander,
   describe the networking protocols that enable Gander's search, and
   provide a realization of Gander via an extensible framework. Employing
   this Gander framework, we describe a concrete middleware implementation
   for wirelessly networked environments. We evaluate this implementation
   of Gander through a user study that examines the perceived utility of
   myGander, a real-worldmobile application enabled by the Gander
   middleware, and we benchmark the performance of Gander in large
   pervasive computing spaces through network simulation.}},

   common issues associated with finite deformation inherently present
   within the seabed scour problem using a rheological approach for soil
   flow. The seabed is modeled as a viscous non-Newtonian fluid, and its
   interface described implicitly through a level-set function. The
   history-independent model allows for large displacements and
   deformations of the ridge and seabed, respectively. Numerical examples
   are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the method with regard
   to seabed scouring and the ensuing large soil deformation. (C) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{A finite element analysis of steady-state crack growth in pseudoelastic
   shape memory alloys under the assumption of adiabatic conditions is
   carried out for plane strain, mode I loading. The crack is assumed to
   propagate at a critical level of the crack-tip energy release rate and
   the fracture toughness is obtained as the ratio of the far-field applied
   energy release rate to the crack-tip critical value. Results related to
   the influence of latent heat on the near-tip stress field and fracture
   toughness are presented for a range of parameters related to
   thermomechanical coupling. The levels of fracture toughness enhancement,
   associated with the energy dissipated by the transformed material in the
   wake of the growing crack, are found to be lower under adiabatic
   conditions than under isothermal conditions {[}Baxevanis et al., 2014,
   J. Appl. Mech., 81, 041005]. Given that in real applications of shape
   memory alloy (SMA) components the processes are usually not adiabatic,
   which is the case with the lowest energy dissipation during a cyclic
   loading-unloading process (hysteresis), it is expected that the actual
   level of transformation toughening would be higher than the one
   corresponding to the adiabatic case.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic Graphical Modeling of Use Stage Energy Consumption: A
   Lightweight Vehicle Example}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Although energy consumption during product use can lead to significant
   environmental impacts, the relationship between a product's usage
   context and its environmental performance is rarely considered in design
   evaluations. Traditional analyses rely on broad, average usage
   conditions and do not differentiate between contexts for which design
   decisions are highly beneficial and contexts for which the same decision
   may offer limited benefits or even penalties in terms of environmental
   performance. In contrast, probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) provide
   the capability of modeling usage contexts as variable factors. This
   research demonstrates a method for representing the usage context as a
   PGM and illustrates it with a lightweight vehicle design example.
   Factors such as driver behavior, alternative driving schedules, and
   residential density are connected by conditional probability
   distributions derived from publicly available data sources. Unique
   scenarios are then defined as sets of conditions on these factors to
   provide insight into sources of variability in lifetime energy use. The
   vehicle example demonstrates that implementation of realistic usage
   scenarios via a PGM can provide a much higher fidelity investigation of
   use stage energy savings than commonly found in the literature and that,
   even in the case of a universally beneficial design decisions, distinct
   scenarios can have significantly different implications for the
   effectiveness of lightweight vehicle designs.}},

Number = {{1-2, SI}},
Pages = {{103-127}},

Abstract = {{Transposable data represents interactions among two sets of entities,
   and are typically represented as a matrix containing the known
   interaction values. Additional side information may consist of feature
   vectors specific to entities corresponding to the rows and/or columns of
   such a matrix. Further information may also be available in the form of
   interactions or hierarchies among entities along the same mode (axis).
   We propose a novel approach for modeling transposable data with missing
   interactions given additional side information. The interactions are
   modeled as noisy observations from a latent noise free matrix generated
   from a matrix-variate Gaussian process. The construction of row and
   column covariances using side information provides a flexible mechanism
   for specifying a-priori knowledge of the row and column correlations in
   the data. Further, the use of such a prior combined with the side
   information enables predictions for new rows and columns not observed in
   the training data. In this work, we combine the matrix-variate Gaussian
   process model with low rank constraints. The constrained Gaussian
   process approach is applied to the prediction of hidden associations
   between genes and diseases using a small set of observed associations as
   well as prior covariances induced by gene-gene interaction networks and
   disease ontologies. The proposed approach is also applied to recommender
   systems data which involves predicting the item ratings of users using
   known associations as well as prior covariances induced by social
   networks. We present experimental results that highlight the performance
   of constrained matrix-variate Gaussian process as compared to state of
   the art approaches in each domain.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the preparation and characterization of biomimetic
   chitosan/multiwall carbon nanotubes/nano-hydroxyapatite (CTS/MWCNT/nHAp)
   scaffolds and their viability for bone tissue engineering applications.
   The cryogenic process ice segregation-induced self-assembly (ISISA) was
   used to fabricate 3D biomimetic CTS scaffolds. Proper combination of
   cryogenics, freeze-drying, nature and molecular ratio of solutes give
   rise to 3D porous interconnected scaffolds with clusters of nHAp
   distributed along the scaffold surface. The effect of doping in CNT (e.
   g. with oxygen and nitrogen atoms) on cell viability was tested. Under
   the same processing conditions, pore size was in the range of 20-150 mu
   m and irrespective on the type of CNT. Studies on cell viability with
   scaffolds were carried out using human cells from periosteum biopsy.
   Prior to cell seeding, the immunophenotype of mesenchymal periosteum or
   periosteum-derived stem cells (MSCs-PCs) was characterized by flow
   cytometric analysis using fluorescence-activated and characteristic cell
   surface markers for MSCs-PCs. The characterized MSCs-PCs maintained
   their periosteal potential in cell cultures until the 2nd passage from
   primary cell culture. Thus, the biomimetic CTS/MWCNT/nHAp scaffolds
   demonstrated good biocompatibility and cell viability in all cases such
   that it can be considered as promising biomaterials for bone tissue
   engineering. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The careful scrutiny of drug delivery systems is essential to evaluate
   and justify their potential for the clinic. Among the various studies
   necessary for preclinical testing, the impact of degradation is commonly
   overlooked. In this article, we investigate the effect of fabrication
   (porosity and nucleation layer) and environment (buffer and pH) factors
   on the degradation kinetics of multistage nanovectors (MSV) composed of
   porous silicon. The degradation by-products of MSV were exposed to
   endothelial cells and analyzed for detrimental effects on cellular
   internalization, architecture, proliferation, and cell cycle. Increases
   in porosity resulted in accelerated degradation exhibiting smaller-sized
   particles at comparable times. Removal of the nucleation layer (thin
   layer of small pores formed during the initial steps of etching)
   triggered a premature collapse of the entire central porous region of
   MSV. Variations in buffers prompted a faster degradation rate yielding
   smaller MSV within faster time frames, whereas increases in pH
   stimulated erosion of MSV and thus faster degradation. In addition,
   exposure to these degradation by-products provoked negligible impact on
   the proliferation and cell cycle phases on primary endothelial cells. In
   this study, we propose methods that lay the foundation for future
   investigations toward understanding the impact of the degradation of
   drug delivery platforms. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential for coordinated control of a large
   number of residential air conditioning systems to achieve substantial
   reductions in peak electricity demand. To do so, an extensive data set
   including home energy audits, homeowner surveys, and electricity meter
   measurements from homes in Austin, Texas, USA, was used to build a
   simulated community of 900 homes. Based on a reduced-order modeling
   strategy and an economic model predictive control approach, we analyze
   the effects of the community of homes responding optimally to variations
   in wholesale market electricity prices. We find that when exposed to
   dynamic pricing, peak demand from residential electricity consumption is
   shifted to earlier in the day, and is lower than the peak where no
   intervention is made. We also consider centralized and decentralized
   strategies for minimizing the peak demand of the community. For this
   simulated community, we find that centralized, coordinated control of
   residential air conditioning systems reduces overall peak by 8.8\% but
   increases total energy consumption by 133\%. Decentralized control
   reduces overall peak by 5.7\%, demonstrating that the value of
   information sharing for peak reduction is 3.1\%. It is also shown that
   properly tuned penalty terms allow a penalty-based decentralized
   controller to approach the optimal solution obtained by a centralized
   controller without the requirement of information sharing. (C) 2014

Title = {{Effects of geochemical reaction on double diffusive natural convection
   of CO2 in brine saturated geothermal reservoir}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{In order for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, as we know, the
   storage of CO2 in deep geological formations is considered as a
   promising option. Besides convective mixing an understanding of
   geochemical reaction that affects the long term storage process in deep
   saline aquifers is of great importance. In this study we numerically
   investigate double diffusive natural convection of CO2 in brine
   saturated geothermal reservoir which is anisotropic in permeability
   variations, impervious from the sides, and is open to CO2 at the top.
   Our primary objective is to understand effects of geochemical reactions
   of different rates and orders on density driven natural convection of
   CO2 due to concentration and geothermal gradients. We present
   propagation of CO2 plumes over long period of time by analyzing
   different combination of problem parameters: Damkohler number (0.01 <=
   Da <= 10(5)) with variation of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order reactions;
   solutal Rayleigh number (500 <= Ra-s <= 2000); the buoyancy ratio (2 <=
   N <= 100); Dykstra-Parsons coefficient (0.35 <= V-dp <= 0.85); and fixed
   Lewis and Prandtl numbers. Reaction order is set from relevant
   stoichiometric ratio. In each case results are quantified in term of
   percentage of CO2 deposition. It is found that mineral interactions make
   traceable difference of depositions as reaction rate increases,
   especially when Da > 10(3). In one hand, compared to very minimum
   geochemical interaction (Da similar to 0.01) the strong reaction effects
   (Da similar to 10(4)) can make difference of more than 5\% in the period
   of 500 years of trapping. On the other hand, at a fixed equivalent Da
   reaction order also makes substantial distinction as deposition time
   passes. Heterogeneity plays a vital role. Geothermal gradient has very
   negligible effect, however only after very long time (>500 years). (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, aluminum foam test sections with discrete pore-size
   gradients were experimentally investigated. The test sections, which
   were created by combining foams with up to three different values of
   pores per inch (PPI), were uniformly heated from below by a flat heater
   and cooled by a controlled air stream flowing through the foam. The
   overall dimensions of the foams tested were 25.4 mm wide and 6.4 mm
   thick, and the individual length of a foam section varied between 101.6
   mm, 50.8 mm, and 25.4 mm, depending on the number of segments with
   different PPIs being tested. The pressure drops were measured, and the
   heat transfer coefficients were calculated for all foam combinations
   considered. The hydrodynamic results showed that the number of sections
   did not affect the overall pressure drop across the test section if all
   segments had the same PPI. Also, a higher heat transfer coefficient was
   observed when air flowed first through the foam with the larger pores
   (smaller PPI) compared with that of the test section in the reversed
   orientation. However, the heat transfer coefficients of the mixed-foam
   test sections were not greater than their better performing whole-foam
   counterpart, at least for the samples tested. This suggests that,
   perhaps, metal foams with more refined geometric features could be
   exploited to allow the tradeoffs between heat transfer, required pumping
   power, weight, etc., to become identifiable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{High-volume fraction simulations of two-dimensional vesicle suspensions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{274}},
Pages = {{245-267}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{We consider numerical algorithms for the simulation of the rheology of
   two-dimensional vesicles suspended in a viscous Stokesian fluid. The
   vesicle evolution dynamics is governed by hydrodynamic and elastic
   forces. The elastic forces are due to local inextensibility of the
   vesicle membrane and resistance to bending. Numerically resolving
   vesicle flows poses several challenges. For example, we need to resolve
   moving interfaces, address stiffness due to bending, enforce the
   inextensibility constraint, and efficiently compute the (non-negligible)
   long-range hydrodynamic interactions.
   Our method is based on the work of Rahimian et al. (2010) {[}33]. It is
   a boundary integral formulation of the Stokes equations coupled to the
   interface mass continuity and force balance. We extend the algorithms
   presented in that paper to increase the robustness of the method and
   enable simulations with concentrated suspensions.
   In particular, we propose a scheme in which both intra-vesicle and
   inter-vesicle interactions are treated semi-implicitly. In addition we
   use special integration for near-singular integrals and we introduce a
   spectrally accurate collision detection scheme. We test the proposed
   methodologies on both unconfined and confined flows for vesicles whose
   internal fluid may have a viscosity contrast with the bulk medium. Our
   experiments demonstrate the importance of treating both intra-vesicle
   and inter-vesicle interactions accurately. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{274}},
Pages = {{770-782}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the
   electronic structure problem require a solution of the Kohn-Sham
   equation, which requires one to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem.
   Solving the eigenvalue problem is usually the most expensive part in DFT
   calculations. Sparse iterative diagonalization methods that compute
   explicit eigenvectors can quickly become prohibitive for large scale
   problems. The Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration (CheFSI) method
   avoids most of the explicit computation of eigenvectors and results in a
   significant speedup over iterative diagonalization methods for the DFT
   self-consistent field (SCF) calculations. However, the original
   formulation of the CheFSI method utilizes a sparse iterative
   diagonalization at the first SCF step to provide initial vectors for
   subspace filtering at latter SCF steps. This diagonalization is
   expensive for large scale problems. We develop a new initial filtering
   step to avoid completely this diagonalization, thus making the CheFSI
   method free of sparse iterative diagonalizations at all SCF steps. Our
   new approach saves memory usage and can be two to three times faster
   than the original CheFSI method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A new parallel discontinuous Galerkin solver, called ArcOn, is developed
   to describe the intermittent turbulent transport of filamentary blobs in
   the scrape-off layer (SOL) of fusion plasma. The model is comprised of
   an elliptic subsystem coupled to two convection-dominated
   reaction-diffusion-convection equations. Upwinding is used for a class
   of numerical fluxes developed to accommodate cross product driven
   convection, and the elliptic solver uses SIPG, NIPG, IIPG, Brezzi, and
   Bassi-Rebay fluxes to formulate the stiffness matrix. A novel entropy
   sensor is developed for this system, designed for a space-time varying
   artificial diffusion/viscosity regularization algorithm. Some numerical
   experiments are performed to show convergence order on manufactured
   solutions, regularization of blob/streamer dynamics in the SOL given
   unstable parameterizations, long-time stability of modon (or dipole
   drift vortex) solutions arising in simulations of drift-wave turbulence,
   and finally the formation of edge mode turbulence in the scrape-off
   layer under turbulent saturation conditions. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns regarding the potential health effects of microorganisms in the
   indoor environment paired with recent advances in DNA sequencing
   technologies have led to a rapid expansion in microbial studies of the
   built environment. The objective of this study is to compare the
   microbial communities recovered from six different samplers placed in
   the same building to assess how sample selection can impact the
   interpretation of the indoor microbiome. To this end, pyrosequencing was
   used to delineate the fungal and bacterial communities recovered from
   six samplers placed in an occupied retail building over two consecutive
   sampling events spaced one week apart. The microbial communities (335K+
   sequences) were much more diverse in the settled dust and heating,
   ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) filter dust samples than the
   communities recovered from the shorter term, composite samples collected
   in four different bioaerosol samplers. The bacterial communities
   recovered from a given sampler were in general more similar to
   communities from the same samplers than to communities recovered during
   the same sampling event. Only 14\% of the bacterial OTUs and 44\% of the
   fungal OTUs detected were shared in all four bioaerosol samplers,
   despite the fact that the samplers were collocated and sampled the
   indoor air simultaneously. These results indicate that sample type
   should be considered when interpreting results, particularly when
   comparing results across multiple studies that use different sampling
   techniques. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost, thin, flexible, and mechanically robust alkali-ion
   electrolyte separator is shown to allow fabrication of a safe

   particles and cross-linked ethylene-oxide chains; it can be fabricated
   at low cost into a large-area thin membrane that blocks dendrites from
   an alkali-metal anode. To block a soluble ferrocene redox molecule from
   crossing from the cathode side to the anode in a Li-ion battery with a
   redox-flow cathode, a thin mixed Li+/electronic-conducting film has been
   added to the cathode side of the composite separator. An osmosis issue
   was minimized by balancing concentrations of solutes on the two sides of
   the separator where the cathode side contains a soluble redox molecule.

Title = {{On the origin of the significant difference in lithiation behavior
   between silicon and germanium}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{263}},
Pages = {{252-258}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Silicon and germanium are both recognized as a promising anode material
   for high-energy lithium-ion batteries. Si is best known for its superior
   energy storage capacity, while Ge exhibits better rate capability and
   cycleability. To better understand the underlying reasons behind their
   lithiation behavior differences, particularly the enhanced Li transport
   in Ge, we examine and compare Li-host lattice interactions and dynamics
   using density functional theory calculations. At the onset of
   lithiation, an isolated Li interstitial is found to form polar covalent
   bonds with four nearest host atoms, while the degree of covalency is
   noticeably greater for Li Si than Li Ge bonds. The relatively stronger
   Li Si interaction, along with the stiffer Si lattice tend to be
   responsible for the suppressed Li mobility (D-Li = 10(-13) cm(2) s(-1))
   in c-Si, as compared to the c-Ge case (D-Li 1011 cm(2) s(-1)) With
   continued lithiation, D-Li in a-LixSi increases significantly from
   10(-12) to 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) (x = 0.14-3.57); contrarily, D-Li in
   a-LixGe is around 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) and less concentration dependent.
   Our analysis shows that the rapid Li diffusion in a-LixGe is directly
   related to the facile atomic rearrangements of host Ge atoms even at the
   early stages of lithiation. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{SiOx-based resistive random access memory devices with
   metal-insulator-metal structure are compared to
   metal-insulator-semiconductor structures, and the effects of external
   resistance on device performance are characterized. The different reset
   behaviors are explained as a positive feedback mechanism involving a
   sudden voltage decrease across the external series resistance when the
   reset process commences. By varying external resistance, we observe a
   constant threshold voltage (2.46 V) for the reset process that is
   possibly due to a voltage-triggered switching mechanism. Our
   experimental results not only clarify the reset mechanism but also
   provide insights on optimization of external resistance for programing
   reliability and operating speed. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one important bottleneck in the
   development of economical photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting
   materials. To help address this we report the electrodeposition of
   Ni-doped FeOOH (Ni:FeOOH) as an OER electrocatalyst. The deposition
   method is applicable to a wide range of photoanodes and catalytic films
   as thin as a few nanometers can be easily grown. The Ni: FeOOH films
   with 5-20\% Ni content reach 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M NaOH at an
   overpotential ranging from 420-460 mV initially, and improve with

Abstract = {{A rigorous thermodynamic model in Aspen Plush was developed to predict
   the thermodynamic properties of PZ-AMP-CO2-H2O over a wide range of
   conditions using the electrolyte non-random two liquid activity
   coefficient (e-NRTL) model. The sequential regression methodology was
   applied. This model is based on the piperazine (PZ) model developed by
   Frailie, in which PZ was treated as a Henry's component. Vapor-liquid
   equilibrium (VLE), heat capacity, and excess enthalpy data for the
   binary aqueous 2-amino-2-methyl-propanol (AMP) system were used to get
   the e-NRTL interaction parameters for AMP-H2O. Unavailable standard
   state properties of protonated amines were regressed from pK(a) data.
   VLE data for AMP-CO2-H2O were used to determine the e-NRTL interaction
   parameters for the molecule-electrolyte binaries. Finally, the
   thermodynamic model for PZ-AMP-CO2-H2O was obtained by regressing the
   VLE and heat capacity data for PZ-AMP-H2O and VLE data for
   PZ-AMP-C-2-H2O in two steps. The model succeeds in predicting CO2
   solubility, NMR speciation, and heat of CO2 absorption for PZ-AMP blends
   with variable loading and temperature. The thermodynamic model can be
   used for the simulation and design of the CO2 capture process. (C) 2014

Title = {{Improved quasiparticle wave functions and mean field for G(0)W(0)
   calculations: Initialization with the COHSEX operator}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{The GW approximation to the electron self-energy has become a standard
   method for ab initio calculation of excited-state properties of
   condensed-matter systems. In many calculations, the G W self-energy
   operator, E, is taken to be diagonal in the density functional theory
   (DFT) Kohn-Sham basis within the G0 W0 scheme. However, there are known
   situations in which this diagonal Go Wo approximation starting from DFT
   is inadequate. We present two schemes to resolve such problems. The
   first, which we called sc-COHSEX-PG W, involves construction of an
   improved mean field using the static limit of GW, known as COHSEX
   (Coulomb hole and screened exchange), which is significantly simpler to
   treat than GW W. In this scheme, frequency-dependent self energy E(N),
   is constructed and taken to be diagonal in the COHSEX orbitals after the
   system is solved self-consistently within this formalism. The second
   method is called off diagonal-COHSEX G W (od-COHSEX-PG W). In this
   method, one does not self-consistently change the mean-field starting
   point but diagonalizes the COHSEX Hamiltonian within the Kohn-Sham basis
   to obtain quasiparticle wave functions and uses the resulting orbitals
   to construct the G W E in the diagonal form. We apply both methods to a
   molecular system, silane, and to two bulk systems, Si and Ge under
   pressure. For silane, both methods give good quasiparticle wave
   functions and energies. Both methods give good band gaps for bulk
   silicon and maintain good agreement with experiment. Further, the
   sc-COHSEX-PGW method solves the qualitatively incorrect DFT mean-field
   starting point (having a band overlap) in bulk Ge under pressure.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that patterns in the usage of synonymous codons
   provide evidence that individual tRNA molecules are recycled through the
   ribosome, translating several occurrences of the same amino acid before
   diffusing away. The claimed evidence is based on counting the frequency
   with which pairs of synonymous codons are used at nearby occurrences of
   the same amino acid, as compared to the frequency expected if each codon
   were chosen independently from a single genome-wide distribution. We
   show that such statistics simply measure variation in codon preferences
   across a genome. As a negative control on the potential contribution of
   pressure to exploit tRNA recycling on these signals, we examine
   correlations in the usage of codons that encode different amino acids.
   We find that these controls are statistically as strong as the claimed
   evidence and conclude that there is no informatic evidence that tRNA
   recycling is a force shaping codon usage.}},

Abstract = {{The inherently large surface area and electrical conductivity of
   graphene-like electrodes have motivated extensive research for their use
   in supercapacitors. Although these properties are beneficial for the
   electric double layer (EDL) capacitance, the full utilization of
   graphene is curtailed by its intrinsically limited quantum capacitance
   due to the low density of electronic states near the neutrality point.
   While recent work has demonstrated that modifications to graphene can
   generally mitigate this limitation, a comprehensive analysis of the
   impact of graphene edges, which can be created during synthesis and
   post-treatment, has yet to be reported. Using a theoretical approach, we
   investigate the influence of graphene edges on both the quantum and EDL
   capacitances using edge-passivated zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs)
   in {[}BMIM]{[}PF6] ionic liquid as model systems. Our findings show that
   the presence of edges improves the quantum capacitance by increasing the
   electronic density of states, which is further amplified as the ZGNR
   width decreases. Our analysis also reveals that the EDL microstructure
   can be noticeably altered by the edges, which in turn increases the EDL
   capacitance. Through comparisons with pristine graphene electrodes, our
   study clearly highlights that edge defects in graphene-like electrodes
   can enhance supercapacitor performance by dramatically augmenting both
   EDL and quantum capacitances.}},

   Li{[}Li0.2Ni0.2-x/2Mn0.6-x/2Cox]O-2 (0 <= x <= 0.24) has been
   investigated systematically. Electrochemical charge/discharge
   measurements in lithium-ion cells indicate that the oxygen loss from the
   lattice during the first charge is a kinetically slow process, but it
   can be improved by the substitution of Co3+ due to an overlap of the
   Co3+/4+:t(2g) band with the top of the O2-:2p band and an increase in
   metal-oxygen covalence. Although the increased oxygen loss with
   increasing Co3+ substitution leads to a higher reversible capacity, the
   first cycle discharge voltage decreases slightly due to the higher
   concentration of Mn3+ ions created during the first discharge. However,
   both the capacity fade and the voltage decay increase during extended
   cycling with increasing Co3+ substitution due to an increasing migration
   of the transition-metal ions to the lithium layer, which is promoted by
   the higher number of oxide-ion vacancies in the lattice, to form a

Abstract = {{The sodium electrochemistry of evaporatively deposited tin, germanium,
   and alloys of the two elements is reported. Limiting the sodium
   stripping voltage window to 0.75 V versus Na/Na+ improves the stability
   of the tin and tin-rich compositions on repeated sodiation/desodiation
   cycles, whereas the germanium and germanium-rich alloys were stable up
   to 1.5 V. The stability of the electrodes could be correlated to the
   surface mobility of the alloy species during deposition suggesting that
   tin must be effectively immobilized in order to be successfully utilized
   as a stable electrode. While the stability of the alloys is greatly
   increased by the presence of germanium, the specific Coulombic capacity
   of the alloy decreases increasing germanium content due to the lower
   Coulombic capacity of germanium. Additionally, the presence of germanium
   in the alloy suppresses the formation of intermediate phases present in
   the electrochemical sodiation of tin. Four-point probe resistivity
   measurements of the different compositions show that electrical
   resistivity increases with germanium content. Pure germanium is the most
   resistive yet exhibited the best electrochemical performance at high
   current densities which indicates that electrical resistivity is not
   rate limiting for any of the tested compositions.}},

Abstract = {{The optical absorption in 25-mu m-thick, single-crystal Si foils
   fabricated using a novel exfoliation technique for solar cells is
   studied and improved in this work. Various light-trapping and optical
   absorption enhancement schemes implemented show that it is possible to
   substantially narrow the gap in optical absorption loss between the 25
   mu m Si foils and industry-standard 180-mu m-thick Si wafer solar cells.
   An improvement of absorption by 58\% in the near-infrared (740-1200 nm)
   range is observed for the 25 m monocrystalline Si substrates with the
   use of antireflective coating and texturing. The back reflectance of the
   metal foil that provides mechanical support to the ultrathin Si
   semiconductor-on-metal foils is extracted to be similar to 51.5\%, based
   on the reflectance matching with the simulated escape reflectance in the
   sub-bandgap region. The back reflectance is enhanced to similar to 58\%
   by incorporating an intermediate silicon nitride layer on the back
   between the Si and the metal. The incorporation of Al as an improved
   metal reflector on top of the silicon nitride at the backside of the
   solar cell results in a 5.8 times enhancement in optical path length as
   a consequence of the improved effective back reflectance of similar to
   95\%. A thin Si foil solar cell with an unoptimized amorphous
   Si/crystalline Si heterojunction with intrinsic-thin-layer design with
   implementation of such light-trapping schemes shows an efficiency of
   13.28\% with a short-circuit current density (J(SC)) of 35.97 mA/cm(2),
   which approaches the J(SC) of industrial wafer-based Si solar cells. (C)

Abstract = {{Designing near-field computer-generated holograms (CGHs) for a spatial
   light modulator (SLM) requires backward diffraction calculations.
   However, direct implementation of the discrete computational model of
   the Fresnel diffraction integral often produces inaccurate
   reconstruction. Finite sizes of the SLM and the target image, as well as
   aliasing, are major sources of error. Here we present a new design
   prescription for precise near-field CGHs based on comprehensive analysis
   of the spatial bandwidth. We demonstrate that, by controlling two free
   variables related to the target image, the designed hologram is free
   from aliasing and can have minimum error. To achieve this, we analyze
   the geometry of the target image, hologram, and Fourier transform plane
   of the target image to derive conditions for minimizing reconstruction
   error due to truncation of spatial frequencies lying outside of the
   hologram. The design prescription is verified by examples showing
   reconstruction error versus controlled parameters. Finally, it is
   applied to precise three-dimensional image reconstruction. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) are attractive candidates for use as
   barrier films in packaging and high performance membrane applications
   due to their extraordinary barrier properties and chemical resistance.
   However, LCPs usually display extremely low viscosities, which makes
   processing them into multilayer films using coextrusion a challenge due
   to the mismatch of their viscosities with other film components. In this
   study, a commercial grade diepoxy reagent (Heloxy 67) was used to modify
   the rheological properties of a thermotropic main chain LCP. The effects
   of diepoxy concentration and reaction time on the melt viscosity and
   liquid crystal structures of the LCP were investigated. The addition of
   small amounts of diepoxy (e.g., 1.5 wt. \%) increased the viscosity of
   the LCP nearly 15-fold. However, addition of excessive diepoxy (e.g., 2
   wt. \% or greater) led to cross-linking of the LCP. More importantly,
   these modified samples were thermally stable when melt reprocessed at
   temperatures of up to 250 degrees C in air. High quality multilayer
   films were prepared by coextruding the rheologically modified LCP with
   polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride. The orientational order of the LCP
   in the multilayer films was studied by polarized infrared spectroscopy
   as well as x-ray diffraction. Interestingly, instead of aligning along
   the shear direction, the LCP chains tended to orient perpendicular to
   the extrusion direction, presumably due to a `log-rolling' effect during
   processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Marangoni effect describes how fluid flows in response to gradients
   in surface energy. This phenomenon could be broadly harnessed to pattern
   the surface topography of polymer films if generalizable techniques for
   programming surface energy gradients existed. Here, a near UV-visible
   light (NUV-vis) photosensitizer, 9,10-dibromo-anthracene (DBA), was
   doped into thin films of a model polymer, poly(isobutyl methacrylate).
   After exposure to light through a photomask and heating above the glass
   transition, thermolysis of photo-oxidized DBA and grafting to the
   polymer promoted flow of the film material into the exposed regions.
   This mechanism did not significantly alter the molecular weight of PiBMA
   or the film's glass transition temperature, but resulted in an increase
   in film surface energy as indicated by a decrease in water contact
   angle. Film height variations of 580 nm were produced using a mask with
   12.5 mu m features; a mask with 800 nm features was also employed to
   generate topographic features of corresponding width without expensive
   contacting equipment. Due to the broad absorbance spectra of DBA, highly
   accessible and/or unconventional light sources may be employed in this
   process; this advantage was demonstrated by patterning with sunlight.
   The nonspecific radical-mediated nature of the DBA grafting reaction
   makes this a promising approach for many classes of polymers. (C) 2014

Title = {{High fidelity finite difference model for exploring multi-parameter

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are being studied and developed for
   applications in which waste heat, for example, from the exhaust of motor
   vehicles is converted into usable electricity. TEGs consisting of TE
   elements integrated with an exhaust heat exchanger require optimization
   to produce the maximum possible power output. Important optimization
   parameters include TE element leg length, fill fraction, leg area ratio
   between n- and p-type legs, and load resistance. A finite difference
   model was developed to study the interdependencies among these
   optimization parameters for thermoelectric elements integrated with an
   exhaust gas heat exchanger. The present study was carried out for TE
   devices made from n-type Mg(2)si and p-type MnSi1.8 based silicides,
   which are promising TE materials for use at high temperatures associated
   with some exhaust heat recovery systems. The model uses specified
   convection boundary conditions instead of specified temperature boundary
   conditions to duplicate realistic operating conditions for a waste heat
   recovery system installed in the exhaust of a vehicle. The 1st
   generation, and an improved 2nd generation TEG module using Mg2Si and
   p-type MnSi1.8 based silicides were fabricated and tested to compare TE
   power generation with the numerical model. Important results include
   parameter values for maximum power output per unit area and the
   interdependencies among those parameters. Heat transfer through the void
   areas was neglected in the numerical model. When thermal contact
   resistance between the TE element and the heat exchangers is considered
   negligible, the numerical model predicts that any volume of TE material
   can produce the same power per unit area, given the parameters are
   accurately optimized. Incorporating the thermal contact resistance, the
   numerical model predicts that the peak power output is greater for
   longer TE elements with larger leg areas. The optimization results
   present strategies to improve the performance of TEG modules used for
   waste heat recovery systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we have studied the effect of Cr doping on the structural
   and electronic transport properties in 4d perovskites SrMo1-xFexO3(x =
   0, 0.1 and 0.2). Polycrystalline samples were prepared by a soft
   chemistry procedure followed by thermal treatments in a 5\% H-2
   atmosphere. X-ray and neutron powder diffraction analysis were used to
   identify the purity of the samples and provide an accurate description
   of the crystal structure features (GdFeO3 type). The Cr doping at B
   position does not change the space group of the samples; they are all
   cubic, space group Pm-3m, at room temperature. However, upon cooling
   down the samples two structural phase transitions appear, the first from
   cubic Pm-3m structure to a tetragonal structure defined in 14/mcm close
   to 240 K, and the second to an orthorhombic Imma phase below 100 K. Cr
   substitution drives the SrMo1-xFexO3 system from a Pauli-paramagnetic
   state to a weak ferromagnetic state combined with predominant
   antiferromagnetic interactions; the susceptibility and the saturation
   magnetization increases monotonically with increasing the Cr-doping

Abstract = {{We use inverse methods of statistical mechanics and computer simulations
   to investigate whether an isotropic interaction designed to stabilize a
   given two-dimensional lattice will also favor an analogous
   three-dimensional structure, and vice versa. Specifically, we determine
   the 3D-ordered lattices favored by isotropic potentials optimized to
   exhibit stable 2D honeycomb (or square) periodic structures, as well as
   the 2D-ordered structures favored by isotropic interactions designed to
   stabilize 3D diamond (or simple cubic) lattices. We find a remarkable
   ``transferability{''} of isotropic potentials designed to stabilize
   analogous morphologies in 2D and 3D, irrespective of the exact
   interaction form, and we discuss the basis of this cross-dimensional
   behavior. Our results suggest that the discovery of interactions that
   drive assembly into certain 3D periodic structures of interest can be
   assisted by less computationally intensive optimizations targeting the
   analogous 2D lattices.}},

Abstract = {{Cost-effective production of lignocellulosic biofuel requires efficient
   breakdown of cell walls present in plant biomass to retrieve the wall
   polysaccharides for fermentation. In-depth knowledge of plant cell wall
   composition is therefore essential for improving the fuel production
   process. The precise spatial three-dimensional (3D) organization of
   cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and lignin within plant cell walls
   remains unclear to date since the microscopy techniques used so far have
   been limited to two-dimensional, topographic or low-resolution imaging,
   or required isolation or chemical extraction of the cell walls. In this
   paper we demonstrate that by cryo-immobilizing fresh tissue, then either
   cryo-sectioning or freeze-substituting and resin embedding, followed by
   cryo-or room temperature (RT) electron tomography, respectively, we can
   visualize previously unseen details of plant cell wall architecture in
   3D, at macromolecular resolution (similar to 2 nm), and in near-native
   state. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that wall
   organization of cryo-immobilized samples were preserved remarkably
   better than conventionally prepared samples that suffer substantial
   extraction. Lignin-less primary cell walls were well preserved in both
   self-pressurized rapidly frozen (SPRF), cryo-sectioned samples as well
   as high-pressure frozen, freeze-substituted and resin embedded
   (HPF-FS-resin) samples. Lignin-rich secondary cell walls appeared
   featureless in HPF-FS-resin sections presumably due to poor stain
   penetration, but their macromolecular features could be visualized in
   unprecedented details in our cryo-sections. While cryo-tomography of
   vitreous tissue sections is currently proving to be instrumental in
   developing 3D models of lignin-rich secondary cell walls, here we
   confirm that the technically easier method of RT-tomography of
   HPF-FS-resin sections could be used immediately for routine study of
   low-lignin cell walls. As a proof of principle, we characterized the
   primary cell walls of a mutant (cob-6) and wild type Arabidopsis
   hypocotyl parenchyma cells by RT-tomography of HPF-FS-resin sections,
   and detected a small but significant difference in spatial organization
   of cellulose microfibrils in the mutant walls.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconducting higher manganese silicides (HMS), with a nominal
   composition of MnSi1.73, are particularly promising thermoelectric
   materials because of their elemental abundance, nontoxicity, and
   reported ZT of around 0.4 at 800 K for undoped samples. However,
   embedded MnSi impurities naturally form during the melt growth of HMS
   materials. The influences of such naturally occurring MnSi impurities
   within bulk HMS have yet to be carefully studied. Herein, we report the
   synthesis of high-purity MnSi-free single crystals of HMS by chemical
   vapor transport and the thermoelectric properties of consolidated HMS
   samples prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The high purity of the
   HMS crystals is verified by scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy, electron diffraction, and synchrotron high-resolution X-ray
   diffraction. Despite successfully growing high purity HMS single
   crystals, we find that MnSi will nevertheless precipitate from HMS after
   SPS processing. In-situ sychrotron high-resolution X-ray diffraction
   experiments show that HMS are unstable at high temperatures. Despite the
   precipitation of MnSi inclusions within the HMS materials, we show that
   samples prepared from undoped single crystals of HMS exhibit higher hole
   mobilities owing to their higher purity, resulting in an improved
   maximum ZT of 0.52 +/- 0.08 at 750 K.}},

Abstract = {{We use a numerical implementation of polymer self-consistent field
   theory to study the effective interactions between two spherical
   particles in polyelectrolyte solutions. We consider a model in which the
   particles possess fixed charge density and the polymers contain a
   prespecified amount of dissociated charges. We quantify the
   polymer-mediated interactions between the particles as a function of the
   particle charge, polymer concentrations and particle sizes. We study the
   interplay between depletion interactions, which arise as a consequence
   of polymer exclusion from the particle interiors, and the electrostatic
   forces which result from the presence of charges on the polymers and
   particles. Our results indicate that for weakly charged and uncharged
   particles, the polymer-mediated interactions predominantly consist of a
   short-range attraction and a long-range repulsion. When the particle
   charge is increased, the interactions become purely repulsive. A longer
   range, albeit weaker, bridging attraction was also evident for some
   parametric regimes. We demonstrate that the short-range attraction and
   the longer-range repulsion can be modeled as a sum of a depletion-like
   attraction and an electrostatic DebyeHuckel like repulsion. However, the
   amplitude and range underlying the depletion and electrostatic
   interactions are shown to possess a complex relationship to the
   parameters of our system. We present scaling arguments and analytical
   theory to rationalize some of the dependencies underlying the parameters
   governing the interaction potentials.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide is often used as a popular inexpensive transparent conducting
   oxide. Here, we employ density functional theory and local density
   approximation to examine the effects of quantum confinement in doped
   nanocrystals of this material. Specifically, we examine the addition of
   Ga and Al dopants to ZnO nanocrystals on the order of 1.0 nm. We find
   that the inclusion of these dopants is energetically less favorable in
   smaller particles and that the electron binding energy, which is
   associated with the dopant activation, decreases with the nanocrystal
   size. We find that the introduction of impurities does not alter
   significantly the Kohn-Sham eigenspectrum for small nanocrystals of ZnO.
   The added electron occupies the lowest existing state, i.e., no new
   bound state is introduced in the gap. We verify this assertion with
   hybrid functional calculations. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Robust polymer membranes that are highly permeable and selective are
   desired for energy efficient gas separation processes. In this study, a
   series of rigid, bulky triptycene-based diamine monomers were designed,
   synthesized, and subsequently incorporated into the backbone of
   polyimides via polycondensation with
   2,2'-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA) to
   obtain a series of polyimide membranes with high fractional free volume.
   These triptycene-containing polyimides with systematic variations in
   their chemical structure demonstrate the viability of the `tunable'
   fractional free volume by introducing various substituents onto the
   polymer backbone. All the polyimides synthesized exhibited film-forming
   high molecular weight, high solubility, and excellent thermal
   properties, with glass transition temperatures ranging from 280 degrees
   C to 300 degrees C and thermal stability up to 500 degrees C. Compared
   to other classes of glassy polymers, these triptycene-polyimides had
   high combinations of permeability and selectivity, suggesting that a
   favorable free volume size distribution in these triptycene polyimides
   was induced by the unique chain packing mechanism of triptycene units.
   The correlation between gas transport properties and the polymer
   chemical structure was also investigated. Altering the size of the
   substituents neighboring the triptycene units provides greater
   opportunity to fine-tune the fractional free volume and free volume size
   distribution in the polymer, which in turn can change the transport
   properties effectively to meet various separation needs. It is expected
   that additional design modifications made by exploiting the chemistry
   versatility of the triptycene moiety and by selectively adding other
   components may improve these membranes to break the gas
   permeability-selectivity trade-off barrier.}},

Volume = {{131}},

Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{This article reports an exploratory study on the creep and recovery
   behavior of kenaf/polypropylene nonwoven composites (KPNCs), serving as
   a bio-based substitution for polypropylene (PP) plastics in the
   automotive industry due to the environmental concern. The creep and
   recovery behavior of KPNC and solid virgin PP were performed by dynamic
   mechanical analyzer (DMA) which allowed it to be studied extensively.
   The linear viscoelastic limit (LVL) was found at 1 MPa. Two popular
   creep models, the four-element Burgers (FEB) model and the Findley power
   law (FPL) model, were used to model the creep behavior in this study.
   The FEB model was found only appropriate for characterizing short-term
   creep behavior. In contrast, the FPL model was satisfactory for
   predicting the long-term creep performance. The long-term creep behavior
   of KPNC in comparison to virgin PP plastic was predicted using the
   time-temperature superposition (TTS) principle. The 1-year creep strains
   were estimated to be 0.32\% for KPNC and 1.00\% for virgin PP at 40
   degrees C. A three-day creep test was conducted to validate the
   effectiveness of the TTS prediction. KPNC showed a better creep
   resistance and higher recoverability than the virgin PP, especially in a
   high-temperature environment. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetite exhibits unique electronic, magnetic, and structural
   properties in extreme conditions that are of great research interest.
   Previous studies have suggested a number of transitional models,
   although the nature of magnetite at high pressure remains elusive. We
   have studied a highly stoichiometric magnetite using inelastic X-ray
   scattering, X-ray diffraction and emission, and Raman spectroscopies in
   diamond anvil cells up to, similar to 20 GPa, while complementary
   electrical conductivity measurements were conducted in a cubic anvil
   cell up to 8.5 GPa. We have observed an elastic softening in the
   diagonal elastic constants (C-11 and C-44) and a hardening in the
   off-diagonal constant (C-12) at similar to 8 GPa where significant
   elastic anisotropies in longitudinal and transverse acoustic waves
   occur, especially along the {[}110] direction. An additional vibrational
   Raman band between the A(1g) and T-2g modes was also detected at the
   transition pressure. These abnormal elastic and vibrational behaviors of
   magnetite are attributed to the occurrence of the
   octahedrally-coordinated Fe2+-Fe3+-Fe2+ ions charge-ordering along the
   {[}110] direction in the inverse spinel structure. We propose a new
   phase diagram of magnetite in which the temperature for the
   metal-insulator and distorted structural transitions decreases with
   increasing pressure while the charge-ordering transition occurs at
   similar to 8 GPa and room temperature.}},

Title = {{Rheological properties of sodium pyrophosphate modified bentonite
   suspensions for seepage control}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{32-40}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{The placement of plastic fines such as bentonite into pore spaces of
   granular soil deposits is one of the effective methods to control the
   seepage problem. For such an application, bentonite needs to be
   delivered into soils in forms of concentrated suspensions without
   disturbing the original soil matrix using low injection pressures
   (permeation grouting). However, the low penetrability of the
   concentrated suspensions through soils limits their practical
   applicability for large-scale seepage control in the field. In order to
   increase the penetration distance, the initial mobility of the
   suspensions should be increased; however, the suspensions need to
   maintain their thixotropic nature to reduce the washout probability of
   the suspensions from the treated soils overtime. The objective of this
   study is to investigate the rheological properties of concentrated
   bentonite suspensions, modified with sodium pyrophosphate (SPP), for
   evaluating a possible application of the modified suspensions in seepage
   control through permeation grouting. In this paper, yield stress and
   apparent viscosity of the SPP modified bentonite suspensions measured by
   the stress ramp technique are presented. Bentonite suspensions with the
   clay contents of 5, 7.5, 10, and 12\% (by total weight of suspension;
   W/B (weight ratio of water (W) and bentonite (B)) = 19, 12.3, 9, and
   7.3) were tested at various SPP concentrations (0 to 7\% by weight of
   dry bentonite). Moreover, the time-dependent behavior of the suspensions
   was evaluated through measuring the yield stress at various resting
   times (0 to 45 days). The results show that the initial yield stresses
   are reduced to approximately zero and apparent viscosities decrease
   approximately 70-90\% with the addition of 2, 3, and 4\% SPP for the
   7.5, 10, and 12\% suspensions, respectively. The reduced yield stresses
   increase gradually with resting times, reaching approximately 90 to
   180\% of the yield stresses of the unmodified suspensions after 45 days.
   However, the required resting times for full recovery of yield stress
   increase with the increase of percentage of SPP used. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The high-temperature cubic phase of SrCoO3-delta is a promising cathode
   material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) due to its high electrical
   conductivity and oxygen permeation flux. However, this phase is not
   stable below 900 degrees C where a 3C-cubic to 2H-hexagonal phase
   transition takes place when the sample is slowly cooled down. In this
   work we have stabilized a 3C-tetragonal P4/mmm structure for
   SrCo1-xNbxO3-delta with x = 0.05. We have followed the strategy
   consisting of introducing a highly-charged cation at the Co sublattice,
   in order to avoid the stabilization of the unwanted 2H structure
   containing face-sharing octahedra. The characterization of this oxide
   included X-ray (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments.
   SrCo0.95Nb0.05O3-delta adopts a tetragonal superstructure of perovskite
   with a = a(0), c = 2a(0) (a(0) approximate to 3.9 angstrom) defined in
   the P4/mmm space group containing two inequivalent Co positions.
   Flattened and elongated (Co,Nb)O-6 octahedra alternate along the c axis
   sharing corners in a three-dimensional array (3C-like structure). In the
   test cell, the electrodes were supported on a 300-mu m-thick pellet of
   the electrolyte La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.O-17(3-delta) (LSGM). The test cells
   gave a maximum power density of 0.4 and 0.6 W/cm(2) for temperatures of
   800 and 850 degrees C, respectively, with pure H-2 as fuel and air as
   oxidant. The good performance of this material as a cathode is related
   to its mixed electronic-ionic conduction (MIEC) properties, which can be
   correlated to the investigated structural features: the Co3+/Co4+ redox
   energy at the top of the O-2p bands accounts for the excellent
   electronic conductivity, which is favored by the corner-linked perovski
   te network. The considerable number of oxygen vacancies, with the oxygen
   atoms showing high displacement factors suggests a significant ionic
   mobility. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{The mechanism by which polymers, when grafted to inorganic
   nanoparticles, lower the interfacial tension at the oil water interface
   is not well understood, despite the great interest in particle
   stabilized emulsions and foams. A simple and highly versatile free
   radical ``grafting through{''} technique was used to bond high organic
   fractions (by weight) of poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) monomethyl ether
   methacrylate) onto iron oxide clusters, without the need for catalysts.
   In the resulting similar to 1 mu m hybrid particles, the inorganic cores
   and grafting architecture contribute to the high local concentration of
   grafted polymer chains to the dodecane/water interface to produce low
   interfacial tensions of only 0.003 w/v \% (polymer and particle core).
   This ``critical particle concentration{''} (CPC) for these hybrid
   inorganic/polymer amphiphilic particles to lower the interfacial tension
   by 36 mN/m was over 30-fold lower than the critical micelle
   concentration of the free polymer (without inorganic cores) to produce
   nearly the same interfacial tension. The low CPC is favored by the high
   adsorption energy (similar to 10(6) k(B)T) for the large similar to 1 mu
   m hybrid particles, the high local polymer concentration on the
   particles surfaces, and the ability of the deformable hybrid nanocluster
   cores as well as the polymer chains to conform to the interface. The
   nanocluster cores also increased the entanglement of the polymer chains
   in bulk DI water or synthetic seawater, producing a viscosity up to 35
   000 cP at 0.01 s(-1), in contrast with only 600 cP for the free polymer.
   As a consequence of these interfacial and rheological properties, the
   hybrid particles stabilized oil-in-water emulsions at concentrations as
   low as 0.01 w/v \%, with average drop sizes down to 30 mu m. In
   contrast, the bulk viscosity was low for the free polymer, and it did
   not stabilize the emulsions. The ability to influence the interfacial
   activity and rheology of polymers upon grafting them to inorganic
   particles, including clusters, may be expected to be broadly applicable
   to stabilization of emulsions and foams.}},

Title = {{The influence of ankle-foot orthosis stiffness on walking performance in
   individuals with lower-limb impairments}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Passive-dynamic ankle-foot orthoses utilize stiffness to
   improve gait performance through elastic energy storage and return.
   However, the influence of ankle-foot orthosis stiffness on gait
   performance has not been systematically investigated, largely due to the
   difficulty of manufacturing devices with precisely controlled stiffness
   levels. Additive manufacturing techniques such as selective laser
   sintering have been used to successfully manufacture ankle-foot orthoses
   with controlled stiffness levels. The purpose of this study was to use
   passive-dynamic ankle-foot oithoses manufactured with selective laser
   sintering to identify the influence of orthosis stiffness on walking
   performance in patients with lower-limb neuromuscular and
   musculoskeletal impairments.
   Methods: Thirteen subjects with unilateral impairments were enrolled in
   this study. For each subject, one passive-dynamic ankle-foot orthosis
   with stiffness equivalent to the subject's clinically prescribed carbon
   fiber orthosis, one 20\% more compliant and one 20\% more stiff, were
   manufactured using selective laser sintering. Three-dimensional
   kinematic and kinetic data and electromyographic data were collected
   from each subject while they walked overground with each orthosis at
   their self-selected velocity and a controlled velocity.
   Findings: As the orthosis stiffness decreased, ankle range of motion and
   medial gastrocnemius activity increased while the knee became more
   extended throughout stance. Minimal changes in other kinematic, kinetic
   and electromyographic quantities were observed.
   Interpretation: Subjects effectively compensated for changes in
   ankle-foot orthosis stiffness with altered gastrocnemius activity, and
   the stiffness levels analyzed in this study had a minimal effect on
   overall walking performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a new pore-scale method to quantify petrophysical
   properties of hydrocarbon (HC)-bearing shale. Recent studies indicate
   that slip flow, Knudsen diffusion, Langmuir desorption, and diffusion in
   kerogen contribute to the unconventional production properties of
   shale-gas formations. Conventional petrophysical interpretation methods
   do not account for the aforementioned phenomena and are often
   inconclusive when estimating petrophysical properties in shale
   formations. We constructed a pore-scale representation of the lower
   Eagle Ford Shale based on focused-ion-beam-scanning-electron-microscope
   (FIB-SEM) images. Permeability is calculated via previously developed
   finite-difference methods for the cases with and without slip flow and
   Knudsen diffusion. The method also calculates streamlines to describe
   sample pore connectivity. Weighted throat-size distributions are defined
   based on streamlines to represent the most resistive paths for fluid
   flow in the FIB-SEM image. Subsequently, permeability is estimated from
   the dominant throat size in the weighted throat-size distribution. We
   used a new fluid percolation model for HC-bearing shale that expands HC
   from kerogen surfaces and water from grain and clay surfaces into the
   pore space to vary fluid saturation. Isolated pores are randomly
   distributed within kerogen to increase kerogen maturity in the model.
   Electrical resistivity is calculated with a finite-difference solution
   of Kirchhoff's voltage law applied at the pore scale. A parallel
   conductor model was used based on Archie's equation for water
   conductivity in pores and a parallel conductive path for the
   Stern-diffuse layer. Calculations were compared with Waxman-Smits' and
   Archie's predictions of macroscopic electric conductivity. Using
   practical modeling parameters, the parallel conductormodel yields the
   most accurate prediction of pore-scale sample conductivity for various
   cases of water saturation and conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a four-electrode acquisition system to measure the complex
   conductivity tensor of tight and anisotropic shale cores using an
   accurate impedance meter. The complex conductivity tensor was obtained
   by inverting complex electrical potential data (amplitude and phase)
   acquired over a distributed array of electrodes. Inversion of the
   acquired data was performed with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC)
   sampler that can explicitly take into account the nonuniqueness of the
   inverse problem. This approach was validated with direct measurements of
   impedance tensor eigenvalues with a single-component measurement
   technique. Consistent results were obtained using these two methods
   validating those obtained through the McMC sampling strategy. Both the
   in-phase and quadrature conductivities were anisotropic with the same
   anisotropic ratio in agreement with a recently developed petrophysical
   model based on volume averaging. The type of anisotropy of the Bakken
   and Haynesville core samples was found to be transverse isotropic, with
   the anisotropic ratio on the order of 10. In-phase conductivity was
   found to be independent of frequency up to 100 Hz, while the magnitude
   of the quadrature conductivity increased with frequency in the range
   from 0.1 to 45 kHz. Both components were sensitive to water saturation.
   Surface conductivity could be reliably predicted from the quadrature
   conductivity in agreement with the model prediction. The relationship
   between surface and quadrature conductivities was independent on
   saturation and anisotropy.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents numerical well testing method of composite model for
   formation evaluation by using pressure transient data, which are
   provided by CNOOC field tests. Since polymer flooding reservoirs are
   effected by multiple factors, the well testing composite models are
   established by considering wellbore storage effect, convection and
   diffusion. Typical curves, sensitivity analysis and history match are
   also conducted. In the Newtonian-non-Newtonian composite model, the
   pressure derivative curves of the transient section and the radial flow
   section obviously move upward with the increase of polymer viscosity. In
   the non-Newtonian-Newtonian composite reservoir, the greater of the oil
   viscosity, the greater magnitude upturned of the transition section. The
   data of polymer flooding field tests provided by CNOOC indicates that
   our work can accurately evaluate reservoir characteristics in relatively
   homogeneous offshore reservoirs by polymer flooding, which emphasizes
   the potential for the application of this method in relatively
   homogeneous offshore and onshore reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{The clinical use of therapeutic antibodies has increased sharply because
   of their many advantages over conventional small molecule drugs,
   particularly with respect to their affinity, specificity, and serum
   stability. Tumor or infected cells are removed by the binding of
   antibody Fc regions to Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma Rs), which stimulate
   the activation of immune effector cells. Aglycosylated full-length IgG
   antibodies expressed in bacteria have different Fc conformations
   compared to their glycosylated counterparts produced in mammalian cells.
   As a result, they are unable to bind Fc gamma Rs, resulting in little to
   no activation of immune effector cells. In this study, we created a
   combinatorial library randomized at the upper CH2 loops of an
   aglycosylated Fc variant (Fc5: E382V/M428) and used a high-throughput
   flow cytometry library screening method, combined with bacterial display
   of homodimeric Fc domains for enhanced Fc gamma R binding affinity. The
   trastuzumab Fc variant containing the identified mutations (Q295R,
   L328W, A330V, P331A, I332Y, E382V, M428I) not only exhibited over 120
   fold higher affinity of specific binding to Fc gamma RI than wild type
   aglycosylated Fc, but also retained pH-dependent FcRn binding. These
   results show that an aglycosylated antibody expressed in bacteria can be
   evolved for novel Fc gamma R affinity and specificity.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient integral-equation method is presented for the fast analysis
   of scattering from arbitrarily shaped 3-D structures in a rectangular
   cavity. The proposed method employs: 1) the frequency-domain
   surface-volume electric field integral equation to model scattering from
   conductors and dielectrics; 2) the rectangular- cavity Green functions
   to account for the cavity walls; 3) the Ewald method and 3-D spatial
   interpolation to accelerate the Green function computations; and 4) the
   adaptive integral method (AIM) to reduce the computational complexity of
   the iterative method-of-moments solution procedure. The structure of
   interest is first meshed with arbitrary triangular/tetrahedral elements.
   The mesh is then enclosed with an auxiliary regular grid. Next, a
   four-step algorithm is executed: anterpolation (mesh-to-grid),
   propagation (grid-to-grid), interpolation (grid-to-mesh), and correction
   (mesh-to-mesh). The computationally dominant propagation step of the AIM
   is accelerated by decomposing the Green functions into eight components
   that are in convolution or correlation form in the three Cartesian
   directions. This results in eight types of propagation matrices; these
   are in nested Toeplitz or Hankel form and are efficiently multiplied
   with the necessary vectors using 3-D fast Fourier transforms. Numerical
   results validate the method, quantify its costs, and demonstrate its
   utility.}},

Abstract = {{Glaciated mountains remain among the most under-studied regions in the
   world from a physical, social and climate change perspective, which
   complicates the development of appropriate adaptation and hazard
   mitigation approaches. The goal of the High Mountains Adaptation
   Partnership (HiMAP) project is to create conditions necessary for all
   the stakeholders who live in, or are dependent upon glacial watersheds,
   to become more resilient to the impacts of climate change. This article
   documents the origins, establishment, implementation and experiences of
   the HiMAP in the Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) National Park and Buffer
   Zone in Khumbu, Nepal, from its formation in March 2012 up to August
   2014. Regardless of the Partnership's success, it is clear that
   glacier-dominated areas of the world will continue to pose unique
   challenges to highland and downstream communities as they adapt to the
   impacts of global climate change, particularly in terms of the
   increasing threats of glacial lake outburst floods. Given the critical
   importance of glaciated landscapes to the millions of people living in
   cities and communities downstream, this article demonstrates that
   interdisciplinary climate change research approaches and applied field
   projects are necessary for climate change adaptation initiatives to be
   effective.}},

Abstract = {{Aristolochic acid (AA) is an active component in herbal drugs derived
   from the Aristolochia species. Although these drugs have been used since
   antiquity, AA is both genotoxic and carcinogenic in animals and humans,
   resulting in kidney tumours in rats and upper urinary tract tumours in
   humans. In the present study, we conducted microarray analysis of
   microRNA (miRNA) expression in tissues from transgenic Big Blue rats
   that were treated for 12 weeks with 0.1-10 mg/kg AA, using a protocol
   that previous studies indicate eventually results in kidney tumours and
   mutations in kidney and liver. Global analysis of miRNA expression of
   rats treated with 10 mg/kg AA indicated that 19 miRNAs were
   significantly dysregulated in the kidney, with most of the miRNAs
   related to carcinogenesis. Only one miRNA, miR-34a (a tumour
   suppressor), was differentially expressed in the liver. The expression
   of the two most responsive kidney miRNAs (miR-21, an oncomiR and
   miR-34a) was further examined in the kidney, liver and testis of rats
   exposed to 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg/kg AA. Expression of miR-21 was
   up-regulated in the kidney only, while miR-34a was dose-dependently
   up-regulated in both the kidney and liver; the expression of miR-21 and
   miR-34a was unaltered by the AA treatment in the testis. Analysis of cII
   mutations in the testis of treated rats also was negative. Our results
   indicate that AA treatment of rats produced dysregulation of a large
   number of miRNAs in the tumour target tissue and that the up-regulation
   of miR-21 correlated with the carcinogenicity of AA while the
   up-regulation of miR-34a correlated with its mutagenicity.}},

Abstract = {{A blend of piperazine (PZ), N-methylpiperazine (MPZ) and

   solvent for aqueous absorption-stripping. This blend provides improved
   solid solubility and heat of absorption compared to concentrated PZ. No
   insolubility was observed for regions of high CO2 loading, unlike PZ
   solvents. The blend performed like concentrated PZ in terms of CO2
   capacity and CO2 absorption rate, both of which were more than double
   that of a traditional 7 molal (30 wt\%) MonoEthanolAmine (MEA). Thermal
   equilibrium was established between the three constituent amines that
   increases the thermal stability compared to traditional blended
   solvents. The primary drawback of this novel solvent system is enhanced
   amine volatility at absorber conditions compared with both concentrated
   PZ and MEA.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The last few years have seen a resurgence of interest in the use of
   symbolic execution-a program analysis technique developed more than
   three decades ago to analyze program execution paths. Scaling symbolic
   execution to real systems remains challenging despite recent algorithmic
   and technological advances. An effective approach to address scalability
   is to reduce the scope of the analysis. For example, in regression
   analysis, differences between two related program versions are used to
   guide the analysis. While such an approach is intuitive, finding
   efficient and precise ways to identify program differences, and
   characterize their impact on how the program executes has proved
   challenging in practice.
   In this article, we present Directed Incremental Symbolic Execution
   (DiSE), a novel technique for detecting and characterizing the impact of
   program changes to scale symbolic execution. The novelty of DiSE is to
   combine the efficiencies of static analysis techniques to compute
   program difference information with the precision of symbolic execution
   to explore program execution paths and generate path conditions affected
   by the differences. DiSE complements other reduction and bounding
   techniques for improving symbolic execution. Furthermore, DiSE does not
   require analysis results to be carried forward as the software
   evolves-only the source code for two related program versions is
   required. An experimental evaluation using our implementation of DiSE
   illustrates its effectiveness at detecting and characterizing the
   effects of program changes.}},

Abstract = {{The combined effect of rotation and magnetic field on the onset of
   convection in a horizontal layer of electrically conducting nanofluid is
   studied. Three cases of free-free, rigid-free, and rigid-rigid
   boundaries are considered. The two important effects of Brownian motion
   and thermophoresis are included in the model of nanofluid. The linear
   stability theory is employed, and the resulting eigenvalue problem is
   solved analytically for free-free boundaries and numerically for
   rigid-free and rigid-rigid boundaries using the Galerkin technique.
   Numerical results are presented for alumina-water nanofluid. The effects
   of magnetic field, rotation, and various nanofluid parameters such as
   nanoparticle Rayleigh number, modified diffusive ratio, and Lewis number
   on the onset of convection are analyzed, and results are depicted
   graphically. It is found that the critical Rayleigh number is lower for
   nanofluid in comparison with the regular fluid at the same values of
   Chandrasekhar number and Taylor number. The sufficient condition for the
   non-existence of overstability is also obtained. (C) 2014 Curtin

   price. This paper presents a proposed controller that curtails peak load
   as well as saves electricity cost while maintaining reasonable thermal
   comfort. The controller changes set-point temperature when the retail
   price is higher than customers preset price. To evaluate the performance
   of the newly developed demand response controller, detailed energy
   models for two residential buildings are developed to analyze HVAC power
   consumption for different house sizes and floor plans. The house models
   are assumed to be located in Austin, Texas, USA and generated with
   OpenStudio and EnergyPlus. The design of internal load and occupation
   schedule are based on a residential energy consumption survey and
   experimental data by the Pecan Street Project, Austin, TX. In addition,
   historical data from Austin Energy for residential customers, 2012 is
   used to calibrate two house models. In addition, this paper uses the
   historical real-time wholesale price data for the Electricity
   Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) wholesale electricity market to
   model the two types of real-time tariffs that many utilities in the U.S.
   currently use to generate dynamic pricing for demand response programs.
   The simulation results show that our demand response controller could
   provide up to 10.8\% of energy cost savings by using the proposed
   controller with dynamic pricing. While avoiding significant discomfort
   due to temperature change. Also, the results present potential for
   saving considering peak load by 24.7\% and total electrical energy
   saving for HVAC in homes by 4.3\% annually. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We introduce a technique that limits absorption effects in fluorescence
   imaging and does not require extensive imaging processing, thus allowing
   for video rate imaging. The absorption minimization is achieved using
   spatial frequency domain imaging at a single high spatial frequency with
   standard three-phase demodulation. At a spatial frequency f = 0.5
   mm(-1), we demonstrated in both in-vitro phantoms and ex-vivo tissue
   that the absorption can be significantly reduced. In the real-time
   implementation, we achieved a video rate of 19 frames/s. This technique
   has potential in cancer visualization and tumor margin detection. (C)

Abstract = {{We address complications in the coupling of a dynamic ice sheet model
   (ISM) and forcing from an Earth system model (ESM), which arise because
   of the unknown ISM initial conditions. Unless explicitly accounted for
   during ISM initialization, the ice sheet is far from thermomechanical
   equilibrium with the surface mass balance forcing from the ESM. Upon
   coupling to ESM forcing, the result is a shock and unphysical and
   undesirable transients in ice geometry and other state variables. Under
   the assumption of thermomechanical equilibrium, we present an approach
   for finding ISM initial conditionscharacterized by optimization of the
   basal sliding coefficient and basal topography fieldsthat balance a best
   fit to surface velocity and basal topography observations against the
   minimization of unphysical transients when coupling to surface mass
   balance forcing. A quasi-Newton method is used to solve the resulting
   large-scale, partial differential equation-constrained optimization
   problem, where the cost function gradients with respect to the parameter
   fields are computed using adjoints. After studying properties of our
   approach on a synthetic test problem, we apply the method toward
   obtaining optimal initial conditions for a model of the Greenland ice
   sheet. Our results show that, in the presence of uncertainties in the
   basal topography, ice thickness should also be treated as an
   optimization variable. While the focus here is on the coupling between
   an ISM and ESM-derived surface mass balance, the method is easily
   extended to include optimal coupling to forcing from an ocean model
   through submarine melt rates.}},

Abstract = {{In situ measurement of the elastic nonlinear site response is
   advantageous to provide optimal information for prediction of strong
   ground motion at a site. We report the first implementation of a
   technique known as Dynamic Acoustoelastic Testing (DAET) in situ with
   the ultimate goal of developing a new approach for site
   characterization. DAET has shown promising results at the laboratory
   scale for the study of nonlinear elasticity of Earth materials,
   detailing the full nonlinear elastic properties of the studied sample.
   We demonstrate the feasibility of DAET in situ and compare it to other
   methods (nonlinear resonance spectroscopy, wave amplitude dependence of
   propagation velocity, and wave distortion). Nonlinear elastic properties
   are characterized by DAET with the advantage of providing a local
   assessment compared to other methods, here at a depth of 4 m to 5 m. A
   vertical dynamic strain amplitude of 5 x10(-5) produces a relative
   change in compressional wave modulus of 6\%. We measure an effective
   parameter of quadratic elastic nonlinearity of order -10(3), the same
   order of magnitude measured at the laboratory scale in rocks and in
   packs of unconsolidated glass beads. Hysteresis is observed in the
   variation in soil elasticity as a function of the instantaneous dynamic
   strain that evolves as the dynamic strain amplitude is increased from 9
   x10(-7) to 5 x10(-5).}},

Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{147-170}},

Abstract = {{The assessment and characterization of multilinear utility functions
   (MLUFs) may require the elicitation of many attribute weights. In this
   case, the decision maker may find it difficult to provide precise
   assessments and may instead be more comfortable providing a range in
   which the scaling parameters fall or specifying that some parameters are
   larger than others. The question then becomes how the analyst should
   formulate a recommendation given this partial preference information. In
   this paper, we present a generalized Monte Carlo simulation procedure to
   test the sensitivity of MLUFs to changes in the scaling parameters.
   Specifically, we admit any preference information that can be expressed
   as a linear constraint. We then sample from the set of all possible
   MLUFs matching these constraints. We consider the additive MLUF, the
   multiplicative MLUF, the utility-independent MLUF, and the generalized
   utility-independent MLUF. In so doing, we also demonstrate how analysts
   can test the sensitivity of their analysis to the structure of the MLUF
   itself. We illustrate the flexibility of our method within the context
   of a coal-fired power plant siting decision used by previous authors.}},

Abstract = {{Load forecasting is critical for planning and optimizing operations for
   large energy systems on a dynamic basis. As system complexity increases,
   the task of developing accurate forecasting models from first principles
   becomes increasingly impractical. However, for large campuses with many
   buildings, the large sample size has a smoothing effect on the data so
   that aggregate trends can be predicted using empirical modeling
   techniques. The distinguishing features of this work are the large scale
   of the energy system (a college campus with approximately 70,000
   students and employees) and the simultaneous forecasting of heating,
   cooling, and electrical loads. This work evaluates several different
   models and discusses each model's ability to accurately forecast hourly
   loads for a district energy system up to 24 h in advance using weather
   and time variables (month, hour, and day) as inputs. A NARX (Nonlinear
   Autoregressive Model with Exogenous Inputs) shows the best fit to data.
   This time series model uses a neural network with recursion so that
   measured loads can be used as a reference point for future load
   predictions. 95\% confidence limits are used to quantify the uncertainty
   of the predictions and the model is validated with measured data and
   shown to be accurate for a 24 h prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   assumption), and a second one based on a full wake alignment model to
   represent more accurately the wake geometry and its effect on the
   efficiency of the propeller. A comparison of the efficiencies and the

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes a class of finite horizon optimal control problems
   with mixed non-convex and convex control constraints and linear state
   constraints. A convex relaxation of the problem is proposed, and it is
   proved that a solution of the relaxed problem is also a solution of the
   original problem. This process is called lossless convexification, and
   its generalization for problems with state constraints is the primary
   contribution of the paper. Doing so enables the use of interior point
   methods of convex optimization to obtain global optimal solutions of the
   original non-convex problem. The approach is also demonstrated on
   example problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of characterizing a generalized Voronoi
   diagram/partition of a convex polygon in a two-dimensional Euclidean
   space that encodes information about the proximity relations between a
   team of aerial/marine vehicles and arbitrary points in the partition
   space. These proximity relations are determined by the time required for
   each vehicle to reach an arbitrary point (time-to-go) in the partition
   space when driven by a locally optimal feedback control law in the
   presence of a spatiotemporal drift field. The main contribution of this
   work is the presentation of a partitioning algorithm, which is
   decentralized, in the sense that each vehicle can independently compute
   its corresponding cell from the generalized Voronoi partition without
   computing or receiving information about the cells of the other
   vehicles. Finally, we present numerical simulations using data from real
   drift fields to illustrate the key features of the decentralized
   solution to the proposed class of spatial partitioning problems. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper we couple collocated Boundary Element Methods (BEM) with

   Boundary Integral Equation (BIB) arising in the context of a
   ship-hydrodynamic problem, namely the so-called Neumann-Kelvin problem,
   following the formulation by Brard (1972) and Baar and Price (1988). The
   local-refinement capabilities of the adopted T-spline bases, which are
   used for representing both the geometry of the hull and approximating
   the solution of the associated ME, in accordance with the Isogeometric
   concept proposed by Hughes et al. (2005), lead to a solver that achieves
   the same error level for many fewer degrees of freedom as compared with
   the corresponding NURBS-based Isogeometric-BEM solver recently developed
   in Belibassakis et al. (2013). In this connection, this paper makes a
   step towards integrating modern CAD representations for ship-hulls with
   hydrodynamic solvers of improved accuracy and efficiency, which is a

Title = {{Energy savings and the rebound effect with multiple energy services and
   efficiency correlation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{55-66}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The rebound effect, or the increased use of energy services following an
   increase in the efficiency of that service, is widely studied in the
   literature, but it is usually only considered in a single-service
   environment. Such a framework ignores the potentially significant
   indirect rebound effects that occur through increased purchasing power
   for other services and does not allow for joint efficiency improvements
   across many services, what we call ``efficiency correlation.{''} We
   develop a household production model with two energy services and
   distinct but simultaneous efficiency changes to test the implications of
   efficiency correlation on net energy elasticities and the rebound
   effect. Positively correlated efficiency choices across end-uses not
   only increase technically feasible energy reductions but also drive
   additional rebound responses that erode these savings. Model simulations
   suggest that the rebound effects through the efficiency correlation
   channel are just as large as traditional direct and indirect rebound
   effects reported in the literature, though they are offset by added
   technical energy savings. Moreover, we find that negative correlation
   can significantly reverse any energy savings (e.g. a household installs
   energy-saving window panes but then trades in their sedan for a SUV),
   but current Federal efficiency standards make this scenario unlikely.
   This paper offers new insight into a host of additional behavioral
   responses to efficiency improvements, particularly the incidence of
   efficiency correlation across different energy services, and highlights
   its implication for realized energy savings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Regenerating codes enable trading off repair bandwidth for storage in
   distributed storage systems (DSS). Due to their distributed nature,
   these systems are intrinsically susceptible to attacks, and they may
   also be subject to multiple simultaneous node failures. Cooperative
   regenerating codes allow bandwidth efficient repair of multiple
   simultaneous node failures. This paper analyzes storage systems that
   employ cooperative regenerating codes that are robust to (passive)
   eavesdroppers. The analysis is divided into two parts, studying both
   minimum bandwidth and minimum storage cooperative regenerating
   scenarios. First, the secrecy capacity for minimum bandwidth cooperative
   regenerating codes is characterized. Second, for minimum storage
   cooperative regenerating codes, a secure file size upper bound and
   achievability results are provided. These results establish the secrecy
   capacity for the minimum storage scenario for certain special cases. In
   all scenarios, the achievability results correspond to exact repair, and
   secure file size upper bounds are obtained using min-cut analyses over a
   suitable secrecy graph representation of DSS. The main achievability
   argument is based on an appropriate precoding of the data to eliminate
   the information leakage to the eavesdropper.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the mechanism and kinetics of asphaltene deposition in
   stainless steel tubes have been studied experimentally using n-heptane
   as the precipitant. The effects of oil velocity, temperature, and
   oil-precipitant volumetric dilution ratio on the rate of asphaltene
   deposition are investigated. Since the adhesion of asphaltenes on to the
   metal surface is controlled by its transport through the laminar sub
   layer, our focus was limited to studying the phenomena in laminar flow
   regime. The concentration of asphaltenes was measured using UV-visible
   spectrophotometer at 650 nm wavelength. This enabled us to accurately
   measure the amount and extent of asphaltene deposits in the stainless
   steel tube. It is observed that the deposition process is often
   accompanied by significant erosion due to the subsequent dominance of
   shear forces on the asphaltene deposits. However, the erosion is not
   complete and a certain layer of asphaltene deposits remain before the
   deposition process becomes dominant. The initial rate of asphaltene
   deposition increases with the increase in oil velocity and temperature.
   The deposition rates increase with the decrease in the oil-precipitant
   volumetric dilution ratio. The asphaltene deposits were also subjected
   to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize the surface
   composition of atoms responsible for the interfacial interaction forces
   due to the surface functional groups. The fundamental interaction forces
   between asphaltenes and a stainless steel surface was measured by using
   inverse gas chromatography. The surface energy of stainless steel
   indicated the amphoteric nature of the surface, with a slightly higher
   basic component. The surface energy of asphaltenes displayed a very high
   component of Lifshitz-van der Waals forces. However the polar component
   of surface energy of asphaltenes could not be measured due to its very
   strong interaction with the polar probes on account of its polarity. (C)

Abstract = {{We develop an efficient general-purpose no-reference (NR) image quality
   assessment (IQA) model that utilizes local spatial and spectral entropy
   features on distorted images. Using a 2-stage framework of distortion
   classification followed by quality assessment, we utilize a support
   vector machine (SVM) to train an image distortion and quality prediction
   engine. The resulting algorithm, dubbed Spatial-Spectral Entropy-based
   Quality (SSEQ) index, is capable of assessing the quality of a distorted
   image across multiple distortion categories. We explain the entropy
   features used and their relevance to perception and thoroughly evaluate
   the algorithm on the LIVE IQA database. We find that SSEQ matches well
   with human subjective opinions of image quality, and is statistically
   superior to the full-reference (FR) IQA algorithm SSIM and several
   top-performing NR IQA methods: BIQI, DIIVINE, and BLIINDS-II. SSEQ has a
   considerably low complexity. We also tested SSEQ on the TID2008 database
   to ascertain whether it has performance that is database independent.

Abstract = {{Self-assembly characteristics of amphiphilic macromolecules into

   oligosaccharides and aliphatic alcohol precursors, which are all
   currently prominent in the pharmaceutical, food, and supplement
   industries. These block oligomer materials were synthesized by
   functionalization of the precursor materials followed by subsequent
   coupling by azidealkyne cycloaddition and their bulk self-assembly was
   investigated after solvent vapor annealing. Self-assembly of the
   amphiphilic materials into liposomes in aqueous solution was also
   investigated after preparing solutions using a nanoprecipitation method.
   Encapsulation of hydrophobic components was demonstrated and verified
   using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and

Abstract = {{A facile grafting through approach was developed to tether tunable

   approaches that often require copolymers containing anchor groups. The
   polymer coating provided steric stabilization of the NP dispersions at
   high salinities and elevated temperature (90 degrees C) and almost
   completely prevented adsorption of the NPs on silica microparticles and
   crushed Berea sandstone. The adsorption of PAMPS IO NPs decreased with
   the polymer loading, whereby the magnitude of the particle-surface
   electrosteric repulsion increased. The zwitterionic PMPDSA IO NPs
   displayed 1 order of magnitude less adsorption onto crushed Berea
   sandstone relative to the anionic PAMPS IO NPs. The ability to design

Abstract = {{One way to organize 3-D memories is cell arrays stacked on logic where
   the upper die layers contain the cell arrays and the bottom layer
   implements the peripheral logic. A new degree of freedom exists when
   constructing 3-D memories, which is that the order of the die in the
   stack can be selected. This paper proposes a new idea that exploits this
   additional degree of freedom to reduce the cost of yield enhancement. In
   the proposed approach, the cell array die with the most defective cells
   is placed in the lowest layer, followed by the next most defective cells
   in the second lowest layer, and so forth finishing with the die with the
   fewest defective cells on the top layer. The bottommost layer
   (peripheral logic) is designed such that it costs less to tolerate the
   defects on the lower layers than it does on higher layers of the cell
   arrays. This is done by limiting the domain over which some spares can
   be used thereby reducing the number of fuses needed for configuring the
   spare. Results show that the asymmetric repair capability created by
   fine tuning the domain of spares in a 3-D integrated circuit allows
   yield enhancement at a lower cost in terms of number of spares and
   fuses.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1465-1482}},

Abstract = {{We study the forced motion of a tagged soft particle through a jammed
   suspension of identical soft particles using particle simulations. We
   relate the local particle dynamics, microstructure, and microrheology to
   the bulk rheological properties of the suspension. At small forces, the
   tagged particle is trapped in a cage of other particles that resist the
   external force whereas at larger forces the tagged particle breaks free
   of its cage. This is indicative of the macroscopic yielding behavior in
   these materials. The threshold force from microrheology is
   quantitatively related to the macroscopic yield stress. The computed
   microviscosity also follows the shear thinning nature of these glasses
   and matches the exponent of 0.5 observed in bulk measurements. The
   semiquantitative agreement between the micro and bulk viscosity is
   discussed by comparing the microstructural processes involved in both.
   In microrheology, at moderate forces, the probe displacement causes an
   accumulation of particles in the direction of motion and a depleted wake
   behind. In bulk rheology, there are accumulation and depletion of
   particles along the compression and extension axes, respectively.
   Despite these differences, the average number of contacts and the
   elastic contact force on the particles are similar, which justifies why
   microrheology measurements match bulk rheology data. (C) 2014 The

   the built environment}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{117-126}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper uses detailed travel data from the Seattle metropolitan area
   to evaluate the effects of built-environment variables on the use of
   non-motorized (bike+walk) travel modes. Several model specifications are
   used to understand and explain non-motorized travel behavior in terms of
   household, person and built-environment (BE) variables. Marginal effects
   of covariates for models of vehicle ownership levels, intrazonal
   trip-making, destination and mode choices, non-motorized trip counts per
   household, and miles traveled (both motorized and non-motorized) are
   presented. Mode and destination choice models were estimated separately
   for interzonal and intrazonal trips and for each of three different trip
   purposes, to recognize the distinct behaviors at play when making
   shorter versus longer trips and serving different activities.
   The results underscore the importance of street connectivity (quantified
   as the number of 3-way and 4-way intersections in a half-mile radius),
   higher bus-stop density, and greater non-motorized access in promoting
   lower vehicle ownership levels (after controlling for household size,
   income, neighborhood density and so forth), higher rates of
   non-motorized trip generation (per day), and higher likelihoods of
   non-motorized mode choices. Intrazonal trip likelihoods rose with street
   connectivity, transit availability, and land use mixing.
   Across all BE variables tested, street structure offered the greatest
   potential behavioral impacts, alongside accessibility indices (for both
   motorized and non-motorized access). For example, non-motorized trip
   counts are estimated to rise 26\% following a one standard deviation
   increase in this variable, and walk probabilities by 27\% following a
   one standard deviation increase in this index at the destination zone.
   Regional and local accessibility and density (of population plus jobs)
   variables were also important predictors, depending on the response
   being modeled. Simulated model applications illuminate when and to what
   extent significant travel behavior changes may be witnessed, as land use
   settings and other variables are changed, to reflect existing
   neighborhoods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Li2MnSiO4/C nanocomposite with hierarchical macroporosity is prepared
   with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) colloidal crystals as a
   sacrificial hard-template and water-soluble phenol-formaldehyde (PF)
   resin as the carbon source. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses confirm that the
   periodic macropores are approximate to 400 nm in diameter with 20-40 nm
   walls comprising Li2MnSiO4/C nanocrystals that produce additional large
   mesopores (< 30 nm) between the nanocrystals. The nanostructured
   Li2MnSiO4/C cathode exhibits a high reversible discharge capacity of 200
   mAh g(-1) at C/10 (16 mA g(-1)) rate at 1.5-4.8 V at 45 degrees C.
   Although the discharge capacity can be further increased on operating at
   55 degrees C, the sample exhibits a relatively fast capacity fade at 55
   degrees C, which can be partially solved by simply narrowing the voltage
   window to avoid side reactions of the electrolyte. The good performance
   of the Li2MnSiO4/C cathodes is attributed to the unique
   macro-/mesostructure of the silicate coupled with uniform carbon
   coating.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur is appealing as a high-capacity cathode for rechargeable lithium
   batteries as it offers a high theoretical capacity of 1672 mA h g(-1)
   and is abundant. However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is
   hampered by fast capacity fade during both dynamic cell cycling and
   static cell resting. The poor electrochemical stability is due to
   polysulfide diffusion, leading to a short cycle life and severe
   self-discharge. Here, we present the design of a bifunctional separator
   with a light-weight carbon-coating that integrates the two necessary
   components already inside the cell: the conductive carbon and the
   separator. With no extra additives, this bifunctional carbon-coated
   separator allows the use of pure sulfur cathodes involving no complex
   composite synthesis process, provides a high initial discharge capacity
   of 1389 mA h g(-1) with excellent dynamic stability, and facilitates a
   high reversible capacity of 828 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. In
   addition, the static stability is evidenced by low self-discharge and
   excellent capacity retention after a 3 month rest period.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a dual photoacoustic and ultrasound contrast agent-named
   photoacoustic nanodroplet-has been introduced. Photoacoustic
   nanodroplets consist of a perfluorocarbon core, surfactant shell, and
   encapsulated photoabsorber. Upon pulsed laser irradiation the
   perfluorocarbon converts to gas, inducing a photoacoustic signal from
   vaporization and subsequent ultrasound contrast from the resulting gas
   microbubbles. In this work we synthesize nanodroplets which encapsulate
   gold nanorods with a peak absorption near 1064 nm. Such nanodroplets are
   optimal for extended photoacoustic imaging depth and contrast, safety
   and system cost. We characterized the nanodroplets for optical
   absorption, image contrast and vaporization threshold. We then imaged
   the particles in an ex vivo porcine tissue sample, reporting contrast
   enhancement in a biological environment. These 1064 nm triggerable
   photoacoustic nanodroplets are a robust biomedical tool to enhance image
   contrast at clinically relevant depths. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Ablation Outcome in AF with Concurrent MS and OSA. Introduction:
   Metabolic syndrome (MS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are well-known
   independent risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence. This
   study evaluated ablation outcome in AF patients with coexistent MS and
   OSA and influence of lifestyle modifications (LSM) on arrhythmia
   recurrence.
   Methods and Results: We included 1,257 AF patients undergoing first
   catheter ablation (30\% paroxysmal AF). Patients having MS + OSA were
   classified into Group 1 (n = 126; 64 +/- 8 years; 76\% male). Group 2 (n
   = 1,131; 62 +/- 11 years; 72\% male) included those with either MS (n =
   431) or OSA (n = 112; no CPAP users) or neither of these comorbidities
   (n = 588). Patients experiencing recurrence after first procedure were
   divided into 2 subgroups; those having sporadic events (frequency < 2
   months) remained on previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD)
   and aggressive LSM, while those with persistent arrhythmia (incessant or
   >= 2 months) underwent repeat ablation. After 34 +/- 8 months of first
   procedure, 66 (52\%) in Group 1 and 386 (34\%) in Group 2 had recurrence
   (P < 0.001). Recurrence rate in only-MS, only-OSA, and without MS/OSA
   groups were 40\%, 38\%, and 29\%, respectively. Patients with MS + OSA
   experienced substantially higher recurrence compared to those with lone
   MS or OSA (52\% vs. 40\% vs. 38\%; P = 0.036). Of the 452 patients
   having recurrence, 250 underwent redo-ablation and 194 remained on AAD
   and LSM. At 20 +/- 6 months, 76\% of the redo group remained
   arrhythmia-free off AAD whereas 74\% of the LSM group were free from
   recurrence (P = 0.71), 33\% of which were off AAD.
   Conclusions: MS and OSA have additive negative effect on arrhythmia
   recurrence following single procedure. Repeat ablation or compliant LSM
   increase freedom from recurrent AF.}},

Abstract = {{We model and design a graphene-based infrared beamformer based on the
   concept of leaky-wave (fast traveling wave) antennas. The excitation of
   infrared surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) over a `one-atom-thick'
   graphene monolayer is typically associated with intrinsically `slow
   light'. By modulating the graphene with elastic vibrations based on
   flexural waves, a dynamic diffraction grating can be formed on the
   graphene surface, converting propagating SPPs into fast surface waves,
   able to radiate directive infrared beams into the background medium.
   This scheme allows fast on-off switching of infrared emission and
   dynamic tuning of its radiation pattern, beam angle and frequency of
   operation, by simply varying the acoustic frequency that controls the
   effective grating period. We envision that this graphene beamformer may
   be integrated into reconfigurable transmitter/receiver modules, switches
   and detectors for THz and infrared wireless communication, sensing,
   imaging and actuation systems.}},

Abstract = {{A frequency-folded ADC-based broadband sampling receiver that merges
   sampling within the structure of a broadband downconverter is presented.
   The receiver channelizes a broadband input into sub-bands after
   digitization, while employing digital-domain harmonic and image
   rejection. The design offers a frequency-domain approach to
   simultaneously achieving high sample rate and dynamic range per-unit
   power consumption. Noise and distortion performance of the architecture
   is described. An analysis of SNR improvement during signal
   reconstruction that results from the use of multiple paths at baseband
   is presented. A 2 GS/s receiver based on this approach is implemented in
   a 65 nm CMOS process. The receiver spans a bandwidth from 125 MHz to
   1000 MHz, and achieves a mean SNDR of 49 dB across the input bandwidth,
   while providing 38-43.3 dB of gain and a NF of 8.5-13.4 dB.
   Equalization-based calibration results in harmonic and image rejection
   greater than 59 dB and 58 dB, respectively, across the input bandwidth,
   while even better performance may be achieved for tonal interferers. The
   receiver consumes 104 mW from a dual 1.2/2.5 V supply.}},

Abstract = {{Most capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) are
   comprised of individual gap-closing parallel plates. We present an
   unconventional CMUT in which a vacuum-sealed cavity beneath a diaphragm

   individual CMUT pistons under vacuum with mechanical structures to alter
   vibration mode frequencies and mode shapes is thus demonstrated. The
   particular prototype presented spans a distance of 250 mu m and has a
   first rocking mode of vibration at 480 kHz. As a transmitter, the first
   mode radiates ultrasound in-plane along the surface. Frequency response
   characterization of a prototype is performed using laser Doppler
   vibrometry, and a pair of devices is used to perform ultrasonic

   shales}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{273-285}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to study the effect of foam quality on the gas
   productivity of fractured wells in shales. A numerical model of fracture
   propagation is developed which incorporates a 2D fracture model,
   proppant transport, and foam rheology. The fracture conductivity
   distribution is computed from the local proppant concentration, which is
   incorporated in a reservoir simulation model to predict the gas
   production by depressurization. Given the rock mechanical properties,
   the fracturing fluid, proppants, and rock permeability control the shape
   and conductivity of the fractures created during hydraulic fracturing.
   The shape and conductivity of the fracture, in turn, control the gas
   productivity of such a well. Foam quality, proppant size, proppant
   concentration, and rock permeability are varied. The results show that,
   in most cases, the gas production is optimum at an intermediate foam
   quality (of about 65\%) because it creates the largest propped fracture
   area and minimizes leak-off. Only for the case of 0.1 micro-Darcy rock,
   low proppant concentration and large proppant size, the gas production
   increases monotonically with foam quality because high quality foam can
   place a partial monolayer of proppants. Fracturing with water as the
   initial pad and a high quality (65-85\%) foam as the proppant carrier is
   more effective than using the same foam for both pad and slurry. (c)

Abstract = {{Settlement and non-uniform deformation of frozen soil subgrade introduce
   fatal cracks on semirigid base asphalt pavements. This research aims to
   use reinforced wire mesh to reduce serious cracks on semi-rigid asphalt
   pavements in frozen regions. Three impact factors, diameter and interval
   as well as two types of wire mesh have been analysed by loading tests.
   Results have shown that after setting the reinforced wire mesh: (a)
   failure load and displacement of the cement-stabilised crushed gravel
   samples have been improved; (b) diameter and interval of the wire mesh
   have interactive impacts on reinforced sample load capacity; (c) the
   reinforced wire mesh can limit cracks by redistributing stress in the
   specimen; and (d) the multiple linear regression model well reflects the
   variation of loading properties; the results make sense from the
   statistics view as well. Results also represent that the strengthened
   wire mesh can help spread out the applied load, and increase the overall
   loading capacity of cement-stabilised crushed gravel. The results
   provided a reference for semi-rigid base asphalt pavement cracks caused
   by non-uniform deformation on frozen soil subgrade as well as guidelines
   for construction and maintenance in frozen regions.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{68-85}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the current paper, we propose a new multinomial probit-based model
   formulation for integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) models,
   which, as we show in the paper, has several important advantages
   relative to the traditional logit kernel-based ICLV formulation.
   Combining this MNP-based ICLV model formulation with Bhat's maximum
   approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) inference approach
   resolves the specification and estimation challenges that are typically
   encountered with the traditional ICLV formulation estimated using
   simulation approaches. Our proposed approach can provide very
   substantial computational time advantages, because the dimensionality of
   integration in the log-likelihood function is independent of the number
   of latent variables. Further, our proposed approach easily accommodates
   ordinal indicators for the latent variables, as well as combinations of
   ordinal and continuous response indicators. The approach can be extended
   in a relatively straightforward fashion to also include nominal
   indicator variables. A simulation exercise in the virtual context of
   travel mode choice shows that the MACML inference approach is very
   effective at recovering parameters. The time for convergence is of the
   order of 30-80 min for sample sizes ranging from 500 observations to
   2000 observations, in contrast to much longer times for convergence
   experienced in typical ICLV model estimations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   the performance of steel fiber-reinforced concretes in impact-resistant

   results showed that the addition of the steel fibers was effective in
   increasing slab capacity, reducing crack widths and spacings, and
   mitigating local damage under impact. Although the slabs in the program
   were designed to be flexure-critical under static loading conditions,
   the development of inertial forces under impact loading conditions led
   to observed responses and failure modes that were governed by shear}},

Abstract = {{The inhomogeneous generalized population balance equation, which is
   discretized with the direct quadrature method of moment (DQMOM), is
   solved to predict the bubble size distribution (BSD) in a vertical pipe
   flow. The proposed model is compared with a more classical approach
   where bubbles are characterized with a constant mean size. The turbulent
   two-phase flow field, which is modeled using a Reynolds-Averaged Navier
   Stokes equation approach, is assumed to be in local equilibrium, thus
   the relative gas and liquid (slip) velocities can be calculated with the
   algebraic slip model, thereby accounting for the drag, lift, and
   lubrication forces. The complex relationship between the bubble size
   distribution and the resulting forces is described accurately by the
   DQMOM. Each quadrature node and weight represents a class of bubbles
   with characteristic size and number density, which change dynamically in
   time and space to preserve the first moments of the BSD. The predictions
   obtained are validated against previously published experimental data,
   thereby demonstrating the advantages of this approach for large-scale
   systems as well as suggesting future extensions to long piping systems
   and more complex geometries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-The activation of valve interstitial cells (VICs) toward an
   osteogenic phenotype characterizes aortic valve sclerosis, the early
   asymptomatic phase of calcific aortic valve disease. Osteopontin is a
   phosphorylated acidic glycoprotein that accumulates within the aortic
   leaflets and labels VIC activation even in noncalcified asymptomatic
   patients. Despite this, osteopontin protects VICs against in vitro
   calcification. Here, we hypothesize that the specific interaction of
   osteopontin with CD44v6, and the related intracellular pathway, prevents
   calcium deposition in human-derived VICs from patients with aortic valve
   sclerosis.
   Approach and Results-On informed consent, 23 patients and 4 controls
   were enrolled through the cardiac surgery and heart transplant programs.
   Human aortic valves and VICs were tested for osteogenic
   transdifferentiation, ex vivo and in vitro. Osteopontin-CD44 interaction
   was analyzed using proximity ligation assay and the signaling pathways
   investigated. A murine model based on angiotensin II infusion was used
   to mimic early pathological remodeling of the aortic valves. We report
   osteopontin-CD44 functional interaction as a hallmark of early stages of
   calcific aortic valve disease. We demonstrated that osteopontin-CD44
   interaction mediates calcium deposition via phospho-Akt in VICs from
   patients with noncalcified aortic valve sclerosis. Finally,
   microdissection analysis of murine valves shows increased cusp thickness
   in angiotensin II-treated mice versus saline infused along with
   colocalization of osteopontin and CD44 as seen in human lesions.
   Conclusions-Here, we unveil a specific protein-protein association and
   intracellular signaling mechanisms of osteopontin. Understanding the
   molecular mechanisms of early VIC activation and calcium deposition in
   asymptomatic stage of calcific aortic valve disease could open new
   prospective for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.}},

Abstract = {{A small molecule library of pyrido{[}2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione
   derivatives 6-16 was synthesized from 6-amino-1,3-disubstituted uracils
   18, characterized, and screened for inhibitory activity against
   eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K). To understand the
   binding pocket of eEF-2K, structural modifications of the
   pyrido{[}2,3-d]pyrimidine were made at three regions (R-1, R-2, and
   R-3). A homology model of eEF-2K was created, and compound 6 (A-484954,
   Abbott laboratories) was docked in the catalytic domain of eEF-2K.
   Compounds 6 (IC50 = 420 nM) and 9 (IC50 = 930 nM) are found to be better
   molecules in this preliminary series of pyrido{[}2,3-d]pyrimidine
   analogs. eEF-2K activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is
   significantly reduced by compound 6, to a lesser extent by compound 9,
   and is unaffected by compound 12. Similar inhibitory results are
   observed when eEF-2K activity is stimulated by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG)
   treatment, suggesting that compounds 6 and 9 are able to inhibit
   AMPK-mediated activation of eEF-2K to a notable extent. The results of
   this work will shed light on the further design and optimization of
   novel pyrido{[}2,3-d]pyrimidine analogs as eEF-2K inhibitors. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper presents an improved interdiction model to identify maximal
   electric grid attacks. The contribution of the model is that it
   incorporates both short-term (seconds to minutes) and medium-term

   impacts are examined by an interdicted dc optimal power flow model. The
   short-term impacts are addressed by a cascading outage analysis model
   that uses a set of sequentially applied checkers to perform the
   simulation of the cascading outage events and assess the short-term
   impacts of a blackout subsequent to specified terrorist attacks. An
   integer programming heuristic is applied that can utilize standard
   optimization software (e. g. CPLEX) to solve master problems generated
   by the heuristic. The proposed model has been verified using the IEEE
   300-Bus Test System and IEEE RTS 96 Test System. Discussions of the

Abstract = {{Recent emergence of next-generation DNA sequencing technology has
   enabled acquisition of genetic information at unprecedented scales. In
   order to determine the genetic blueprint of an organism, sequencing
   platforms typically employ the shotgun sequencing strategy to oversample
   the target genome with a library of relatively short overlapping reads.
   The order of nucleotides in the reads is determined by processing the
   acquired noisy signals generated by the sequencing instrument. Assembly
   of a genome from potentially erroneous short reads is a computationally
   daunting task even when a reference genome exists. Errors and gaps in
   the reference, and perfect repeat regions in the target, further render
   the assembly challenging and cause inaccuracies. Here, we formulate the
   reference-guided sequence assembly problem as the inference of the
   genome sequence on a bipartite graph and solve it using a
   message-passing algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be interpreted as
   the well-known classical belief propagation scheme under a certain
   prior. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm
   combines the information provided by the reads without needing to know
   reliability of the short reads (so-called quality scores). Relation of
   the message-passing algorithm to a provably convergent power iteration
   scheme is discussed. To evaluate and benchmark the performance of the
   proposed technique, we find an analytical expression for the probability
   of error of a genie-aided maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision scheme.
   Results on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that the
   proposed message-passing algorithm outperforms commonly used
   state-of-the-art tools, and it nearly achieves the performance of the
   aforementioned MAP decision scheme.}},

   An Analysis of the Stationary Distribution and Mixing Time}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an optimized Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for
   solving integer least-squares (ILS) problems, which include maximum
   likelihood (ML) detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   systems. Two factors contribute to its speed of finding the optimal
   solution: the probability of encountering the optimal solution when the
   Markov chain has converged to the stationary distribution, and the
   mixing time of the MCMC detector. First, we compute the optimal
   ``temperature{''} parameter value, so that once the Markov chain has
   mixed to its stationary distribution, there is a polynomially small
   probability (1/poly(N), instead of exponentially small) of encountering
   the optimal solution, where N is the system dimension. This temperature
   is shown to be O(root SNR/ln(N)), where SNR > 2ln (N) is the SNR.
   Second, we study the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain of the
   MCMC detector. We find that, the mixing time is closely related to
   whether there is a local minimum in the ILS problem's lattice structure.
   For some lattices without local minima, the mixing time is independent
   of SNR, and grows polynomially in. Conventional wisdom proposed to set
   temperature as the noise standard deviation, but our results show that,
   under such a temperature, the mixing time grows unbounded with SNR if
   the lattice has local minima. Our results suggest that, very often the
   temperature should instead be scaling at least as Omega(root SNR).
   Simulation results show that the optimized MCMC detector efficiently
   achieves approximately ML detection in MIMO systems having a huge number
   of transmit and receive dimensions.}},

   gradient of the cost functional of this optimization problem with
   respect to two spatially-varying rheological parameter fields: the
   viscosity prefactor and the exponent of the second invariant of the
   strain rate tensor. Adjoint (linearized) Stokes equations, which are
   characterized by a 4th order anisotropic viscosity tensor, facilitates
   efficient computation of the gradient. A quasi-Newton method for the
   solution of this optimization problem is presented, which requires the
   repeated solution of both nonlinear forward Stokes and linearized
   adjoint Stokes equations. For the solution of the nonlinear Stokes
   equations, we find that Newton's method is significantly more efficient
   than a Picard fixed point method. Spectral analysis of the inverse
   operator given by the Hessian of the optimization problem reveals that
   the numerical eigenvalues collapse rapidly to zero, suggesting a high
   degree of ill-posedness of the inverse problem. To overcome this
   ill-posedness, we employ Tikhonov regularization (favoring smooth
   parameter fields) or total variation (TV) regularization (favoring
   piecewise-smooth parameter fields). Solution of two- and
   three-dimensional finite element-based model inverse problems show that
   a constant parameter in the constitutive law can be recovered well from
   surface velocity observations. Inverting for a spatially-varying
   parameter field leads to its reasonable recovery, in particular close to
   the surface. When inferring two spatially varying parameter fields, only
   an effective viscosity field and the total viscous dissipation are
   recoverable. Finally, a model of a subducting plate shows that a
   localized weak zone at the plate boundary can be partially recovered,
   especially with TV regularization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Protein crystallization is dependent upon and sensitive to, the
   interamolecular contacts that assist in ordering proteins into a
   three-dimensional lattice. Here we used protein engineering and
   mutagenesis to affect the crystallization of single chain antibody
   fragments (scFvs) that recognize the EE epitope (EYMPME) with high
   affinity. These hypercrystallizable scFvs are under ones. Guided by
   analyses of intermolecular crystal lattice contacts, two
   second-generation anti-EE scFvs were produced, which from the parent
   scFv framework remained unchanged through the processes of protein with
   installed EE tags. Surprisingly, although noncomplementarity determining
   region (CDR) lattice residues from the parent scFv framework remained
   unchanged through the processes of protein engineering and rational
   design, crystal lattices of the derivative scFvs differ. Comparison of
   energy calculations and the experimentally-determined lattice
   interactions for this basis set provides insight into the complexity of
   the forces driving crystal lattice choice and demonstrates the
   availability of multiple well-ordered surface features in our scFvs
   capable of forming versatile crystal contacts.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses a new network equilibrium problem with mode and
   route choices for the emerging need of modeling regional transportation
   networks that accommodate both gasoline and electric vehicles. The two
   transportation modes (or vehicle types) distinguish from each other in
   terms of driving distance limit and travel cost composition. In view of
   the advantages (e.g., low fuel expenses and vehicle emissions) and
   disadvantages (e.g., limited driving range and long charging time)
   pertaining to driving electric vehicles, it is anticipated that a large
   number of households/motorists may prefer to own both gasoline and
   electric vehicles (although, of course, many households/motorists still
   only own gasoline vehicles (GVs) and some households may choose to own
   electric vehicles only) in the transition period from the petroleum era
   to the electricity era. The purpose of this article is to offer a
   traffic equilibrium modeling tool for networks that serve
   households/motorists who can choose between gasoline and electric
   vehicles. Specifically, we present a convex optimization model for
   characterizing such mixed equilibrium traffic networks with both
   gasoline and electric vehicles, which are expected to exist for a long
   period in the future. Two competing solution algorithms, a linear
   approximation algorithm of the Jacobi type and a quadratic approximation
   algorithm taking the form of the Gauss-Seidel decomposition, are
   implemented and evaluated. Experimental results clearly show that, from
   the model behavior perspective, the produced network flow patterns
   replicate the anticipated combined mode-route choice results, that is,
   the higher the distance limit or the gasoline price is, the more
   travelers choose battery electric vehicles (BEVs) when both BEVs and GVs
   are available to them; and, from the solution efficiency perspective,
   the quadratic approximation algorithm exhibits linear convergence and
   can reach higher solution precision in shorter time.}},

Abstract = {{Ni catalyst-based anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating
   with natural gas fuel are vulnerable to coking (carbon deposition) and
   sulfur poisoning, resulting in impaired anodes and eventual cessation of
   SOFC operation. The incorporation of as small as 1 atom\% W to Ni is
   found to overcome this formidable challenge. The hydrogen tungsten
   bronze (HxWO3-delta  WO3-x-delta(OH)(x)) formed by reaction with the
   water vapor produced during SOFC operation supplies the hydroxyl groups
   to oxidize carbon and eliminate coking on the Ni surface. Mobile protons
   adhered to the oxide ions as well as the mobile oxide ions themselves in
   the AO(3) sublattice of the oxygen-deficient perovskite-type HxWO3-delta
   facilitate a rapid cleaning of the Ni surface. We show here that

Abstract = {{This paper presents a real-time solution method of the maximum divert

   the vehicle is to abort and retarget to a landing site as far from the

   velocity constraints in the range and cross range directions and a total
   speed constraint. The thrust magnitude is bounded above and below so
   that once on, the engine cannot be turned off. Because this constraint
   is not convex, it is relaxed to a convex constraint and lossless
   convexification is proved. A transformation of variables is introduced
   in the nonlinear dynamics and an approximation is made so that the
   problem becomes a second-order cone problem, which can be solved to
   global optimality in polynomial time whenever a feasible solution
   exists. A number of examples are solved to illustrate the effectiveness
   and efficiency of the solution method.}},

Abstract = {{A method is introduced to transition space trajectories from low
   fidelity patched conics models to full-ephemeris n-body dynamics. The
   algorithm incorporates a continuation method that progressively
   re-converges solution trajectories in systems with incremental changes
   in the dynamics. Continuation is accomplished through the variation of a
   control parameter, which is tied to body ephemeris locations and masses,
   minimum flyby altitudes, and sphere of influence sizes. The intermediate
   models provide a continuous and differentiable path between solutions in
   the simplified and n-body dynamics, and the boundary values of the
   control parameter replicate the patched conics and full-ephemeris models
   exactly. Each successive step preserves the qualitative properties of
   the initial guess by successively altering flyby states and body masses.
   A similar approach to this methodology may be taken with any simplified
   starting guess, such as a restricted three-body model. Trajectories
   computed using the patched conics conversion method presented here may
   include gravity assists and rendezvous with any number of target bodies,
   so the method is ideal for constructing interplanetary or intermoon tour
   missions, and is amenable to patching shorter segments together to form
   longer tours.}},

   atmosphere}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{239}},
Pages = {{32-38}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{There is significant scientific interest in simulating the unique
   atmospheric conditions on the Jovian moon Io that range from cold
   surface temperatures to hyperthermal interactions which possibly supply
   the Jovian plasma torus. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method
   is well suited to model the rarefied, predominantly SO2, Ionian
   atmosphere. High speed collisions between SO2 and the hypervelocity O
   atoms and ions that compose the plasma torus are a significant mechanism
   in determining the composition of the atmosphere; therefore,
   high-fidelity modeling of their interactions is crucial to the accuracy
   of such simulations. Typically, the Total Collision Energy (TCE) model
   is used to determine molecular dissociation probabilities and the
   Variable Hard Sphere (VHS) model is used to determine collision cross
   sections. However, the parameters for each of these baseline models are
   based on low-temperature experimental data and thus have unknown
   reliability for the hyperthermal conditions in the Ionian atmosphere.
   Recently, Molecular Dynamics/Quasi-Classical Trajectory (MD/QCT) studies
   have been conducted to generate accurate collision and chemistry models
   for the SO2-O collision pair in order to replace the baseline models.
   However, the influence of MD/QCT models on Ionian simulations compared
   to the previously used models is not well understood. In this work, 1D
   simulations are conducted using both the MD/QCT-based and baseline
   models in order to determine the effect of MD/QCT models on Ionian
   simulations. It is found that atmospheric structure predictions are
   highly sensitive to the chemistry and collision models. Specifically,
   the MD/QCT model predicts approximately half the SO2 atmospheric
   dissociation due to O and O+ bombardment compared to TCE models, and
   also predicts a temperature rise due to plasma heating further from the
   Ionian surface than the existing baseline methodologies. These findings
   indicate that the accurate MD/QCT chemistry and collision models provide
   a significant improvement over the baseline models for DSMC simulations
   of the Ionian atmosphere. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Radionuclide aerosol sampling is a vital component in the detection of
   nuclear explosions, nuclear accidents, and other radiation releases.
   This was proven by the detection and tracking of emissions from the
   Fukushima Daiichi incident across the globe by IMS stations. Two
   separate aerosol samplers were operated in Richland, WA following the
   event and debris from the accident were measured at levels well above
   detection limits. While the atmospheric activity concentration of
   radionuclides generally compared well between the two stations, they did
   not agree within uncertainties. This paper includes a detailed study of
   the aerosol sample homogeneity of Cs-134 and Cs-137, then relates it to
   the overall uncertainty of the original measurement. Our results show
   that sample inhomogeneity adds an additional 5 -10\% uncertainty to each
   aerosol measurement and that this uncertainty is in the same range as
   the discrepancies between the two aerosol sample measurements from
   Richland, WA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{A proposed abiotic reaction scheme for hydroxylamine and monochloramine
   under chloramination relevant drinking water conditions}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{218-227}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Drinking water monochloramine (NH2Cl) use may promote ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB). AOB use (i) ammonia monooxygenase for biological ammonia
   (NH3) oxidation to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and (ii) hydroxylamine
   oxidoreductase for NH2OH oxidation to nitrite. NH2Cl and NH2OH may
   react, providing AOB potential benefits and detriments. The NH2Cl/NH2OH
   reaction would benefit AOB by removing the disinfectant (NH2Cl) and
   releasing their growth substrate (NH3), but the NH2Cl/NH2OH reaction
   would also provide a possible additional inactivation mechanism besides
   direct NH2Cl reaction with cells. Because biological NH2OH oxidation
   supplies the electrons required for biological NH3 oxidation, the
   NH2Cl/NH2OH reaction provides a direct mechanism for NH2Cl to inhibit
   NH3 oxidation, starving the cell of reductant by preventing biological
   NH2OH oxidation. To investigate possible NH2Cl/NH2OH reaction
   implications on AOB, an understanding of the underlying abiotic reaction
   is first required. The present study conducted a detailed literature
   review and proposed an abiotic NH2Cl/NH2OH reaction scheme (RS) for
   chloramination relevant drinking water conditions (mu M concentrations,
   air saturation, and pH 7-9). Next, RS literature based kinetics and
   end-products were evaluated experimentally between pHs 7.7 and 8.3,
   representing (i) the pH range for future experiments with AOB and (ii)
   mid-range pHs typically found in chloraminated drinking water. In
   addition, a N-15 stable isotope experiment was conducted to verify
   nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas production and their nitrogen source.
   Finally, the RS was slightly refined using the experimental data and an
   AQUASIM implemented kinetic model. A chloraminated drinking water
   relevant RS is proposed and provides the abiotic reaction foundation for
   future AOB biotic experiments. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we apply the experimenting pressure field approach to the
   numerical solution of the single phase flow problem in anisotropic
   porous media using the multipoint flux approximation. We apply this
   method to the problem of flow in saturated anisotropic porous media. In
   anisotropic media the component flux representation requires, generally
   multiple pressure values in neighboring cells (e.g., six pressure values
   of the neighboring cells is required in two-dimensional rectangular
   meshes). This apparently results in the need for a nine points stencil
   for the discretized pressure equation (27 points stencil in
   three-dimensional rectangular mesh). The coefficients associated with
   the discretized pressure equation are complex and require longer
   expressions which make their implementation prone to errors. In the
   experimenting pressure field technique, the matrix of coefficients is
   generated automatically within the solver. A set of predefined pressure
   fields is operated on the domain through which the velocity field is
   obtained. Apparently such velocity fields do not satisfy the mass
   conservation equations entailed by the source/sink term and boundary
   conditions from which the residual is calculated. In this method the
   experimenting pressure fields are designed such that the residual
   reduces to the coefficients of the pressure equation matrix. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We carry out a systematic analysis of static properties of the clusters
   formed by complexation between charged dendrimers and linear
   polyelectrolyte (LPE) chains in a dilute solution under good solvent
   conditions. We use single chain in mean-field simulations and analyze
   the structure of the clusters through radial distribution functions of
   the dendrimer, cluster size, and charge distributions. The effects of
   LPE length, charge ratio between LPE and dendrimer, the influence of
   salt concentration, and the dendrimer generation number are examined.
   Systems with short LPEs showed a reduced propensity for aggregation with
   dendrimers, leading to formation of smaller clusters. In contrast,
   larger dendrimers and longer LPEs lead to larger clusters with
   significant bridging. Increasing salt concentration was seen to reduce
   aggregation between dendrimers as a result of screening of electrostatic
   interactions. Generally, maximum complexation was observed in systems
   with an equal amount of net dendrimer and LPE charges, whereas either
   excess LPE or dendrimer concentrations resulted in reduced clustering
   between dendrimers.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we describe the preparation and characterization of a
   new class of thermoset fibers with high elongation and elastic recovery.
   Integrating UV-activated thiol-ene photopolymerization and
   electrospinning, we demonstrate an environmentally friendly single step
   approach to convert small monomeric precursor molecules into highly
   elastic fibers and nonwoven mats. The fibers were derived by in situ
   photopolymerization of a trifunctional vinyl ether monomer and a
   tetrafunctional thiol. Although thermosets often offer good chemical and
   thermal stability, these fibers also have a high average elongation at
   break of 62\%. The elastomeric nature of these vinyl-ether based fibers
   can be partly attributed to their subambient T-g and partly to the
   cross-link density, monomer structure, and resulting network
   homogeneity. Nonwoven mats of these fibers were also stretchable and
   exhibited a much higher elongation at break of about 85\%. These
   thermoset stretchable fibers could have potential applications as
   textile, biomedical, hot chemical filtration, and composite materials.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical conductivity and the specific surface area of conductive
   fillers in conductor-insulator composite films can drastically improve
   the dielectric performance of those films through changing their
   polarization density by interfacial polarization. We have made a polymer
   composite film with a hybrid conductive filler material made of carbon
   nanotubes grown onto reduced graphene oxide platelets (rG-O/CNT). We
   report the effect of the rG-O/CNT hybrid filler on the dielectric
   performance of the composite film. The composite film had a dielectric
   constant of 32 with a dielectric loss of 0.051 at 0.062 wt\% rG-O/CNT
   filler and 100 Hz, while the neat polymer film gave a dielectric
   constant of 15 with a dielectric loss of 0.036. This is attributed to
   the increased electrical conductivity and specific surface area of the
   rG-O/CNT hybrid filler, which results in an increase in interfacial
   polarization density between the hybrid filler and the polymer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new formulation for forward scalar wave
   simulations in semi-infinite media. Perfectly-Matched-Layers (PMLs) are
   used as a wave absorbing boundary layer to surround a finite
   computational domain truncated from the semi-infinite domain. In this
   work, a hybrid formulation was developed for the simulation of scalar
   wave motion in two-dimensional PML-truncated domains. In this
   formulation, displacements and stresses are considered as unknowns in
   the PML domain, while only displacements are considered to be unknowns
   in the interior domain. This formulation reduces computational cost
   compared to fully-mixed formulations. To obtain governing wave equations
   in the PML region, complex coordinate stretching transformation was
   introduced to equilibrium, constitutive, and compatibility equations in
   the frequency domain. Then, equations were converted back to the
   time-domain using the inverse Fourier transform. The resulting equations
   are mixed (contain both displacements and stresses), and are coupled
   with the displacement-only equation in the regular domain. The Newmark
   method was used for the time integration of the semi-discrete equations.}},

Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with high fluorescent brightness,
   stability, and tunable sizes, have received considerable interest for
   imaging, sensing, and delivery of biomolecules. In this research, we
   demonstrate location deterministic biochemical detection from arrays of
   QD-nanowire hybrid assemblies. QDs with diameters less than 10 nm are
   manipulated and precisely positioned on the tips of the assembled Gold
   (Au) nanowires. The manipulation mechanisms are quantitatively
   understood as the synergetic effects of dielectrophoretic (DEP) and
   alternating current electroosmosis (ACEO) due to AC electric fields. The
   QD-nanowire hybrid sensors operate uniquely by concentrating bioanalytes
   to QDs on the tips of nanowires before detection, offering much enhanced
   efficiency and sensitivity, in addition to the position-predictable
   rationality. This research could result in advances in QD-based
   biomedical detection and inspires an innovative approach for fabricating
   various QD-based nanodevices. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Twisted metamaterials, or arrays of identical planar metasurfaces
   stacked with a sequential rotation, have been recently introduced to
   realize broadband circular dichroism. Here we develop a generalized
   Floquet analysis to obtain the exact modal solutions for eigenwaves
   supported by these structures. The dispersion relation and wave
   propagation in twisted metamaterials are discussed in detail. Our
   analysis shows how the modal dispersion in these metamaterials becomes
   inherently different from the one of conventional periodic structures
   and how the eigenmodes support specific circular polarization properties
   based on a lattice effect, even when achiral inclusions are considered.
   These wave properties are ideal to realize optical devices that
   manipulate the polarization state of light over broad bandwidths. By
   analyzing the physical nature of these modes, including complex modes,
   we also extend the application of twisted metamaterials to realize
   passband and stop-band nanophotonic structures with strong polarization
   manipulation properties.}},

Abstract = {{pH-Responsive hydrogels comprised of itaconic acid copolymerized with
   N-vinylpyrrolidone (P(IA-co-NVP)) were synthesized and tested as
   carriers for the oral delivery of high isoelectric point (pI) exhibiting
   therapeutic proteins. Swelling studies show that P(IA-co-NVP) hydrogels
   exhibit significantly greater and faster pH-responsive swelling than
   previously studied methacrylic acid-based hydrogels, achieving up to
   68\% greater equilibrium swelling and 10.4 times greater swelling in
   time-limited experiments. Using salmon calcitonin as a model high pI
   protein therapeutic, we show that P(IA-co-NVP) hydrogels exhibit
   significantly greater delivery potential than methacrylic acid-based
   hydrogels. Additionally, we show that utilizing a lower ionic strength
   solution during drug loading significantly improves drug delivery
   potential for high pI therapeutics. By using a 1.5 mM PBS buffer rather
   than the standard 150 mM PBS buffer during loading, up to 83 times as
   much calcitonin can be delivered in neutral conditions, with up to a
   9.6-fold improvement in percent release. Using P(IA-co-NVP) hydrogel
   microparticles and a low ionic strength loading solution, up to 48 mu g
   calcitonin/mg hydrogel can be delivered in small intestinal conditions.
   Based on expected absorption in the small intestine, this is sufficient
   delivery potential for achieving therapeutic dosage via a single,
   regularly-sized pill taken daily. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Individuals with unilateral transtibial amputations have greater
   prevalence of osteoarthritis in the intact knee joint relative to the
   residual leg and non-amputees, but the cause of this greater prevalence
   is unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare knee joint contact
   forces and the muscles contributing to these forces between amputees and
   non-amputees during walking using forward dynamics simulations. We
   predicted that the intact knee contact forces would be higher than those
   of the residual leg and non-amputees. In the axial and mediolateral
   directions, the intact and non-amputee legs had greater peak
   tibio-femoral contact forces and impulses relative to the residual leg.
   The peak axial contact force was greater in the intact leg relative to
   the non-amputee leg, but the stance phase impulse was greater in the
   non-amputee leg. The vasti and hamstrings muscles in early stance and
   gastrocnemius in late stance were the largest contributors to the joint
   contact forces in the non-amputee and intact legs. Through dynamic
   coupling, the soleus and gluteus medius also had large contributions,
   even though they do not span the knee joint. In the residual leg, the
   prosthesis had large contributions to the joint forces, similar to the
   soleus in the intact and non-amputee legs. These results identify the
   muscles that contribute to knee joint contact forces during transtibial
   amputee walking and suggest that the peak knee contact forces may be
   more important than the knee contact impulses in explaining the high
   prevalence of intact leg osteoarthritis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background: Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2K) regulates
   protein translation elongation rates. Results: eEF-2K activation
   involves a two-step process of calmodulin binding and rapid Thr-348
   autophosphorylation. Conclusion: Activation of eEF-2K involves two
   distinct allosteric steps, both of which potentially induce a
   conformational change. Significance: This mechanism provides a framework
   for understanding how eEF-2K integrates inputs from multiple upstream
   signaling pathways.
   Calmodulin (CaM)-dependent eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase
   (eEF-2K) impedes protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eukaryotic
   elongation factor 2 (eEF-2). It is subject to complex regulation by
   multiple upstream signaling pathways, through poorly described
   mechanisms. Precise integration of these signals is critical for eEF-2K
   to appropriately regulate protein translation rates. Here, an allosteric
   mechanism comprising two sequential conformations is described for
   eEF-2K activation. First, Ca2+/CaM binds eEF-2K with high affinity
   (K-d(CaM)(app) = 24 +/- 5 nm) to enhance its ability to
   autophosphorylate Thr-348 in the regulatory loop (R-loop) by >
   10(4)-fold (k(auto) = 2.6 +/- 0.3 s(-1)). Subsequent binding of
   phospho-Thr-348 to a conserved basic pocket in the kinase domain
   potentially drives a conformational transition of the R-loop, which is
   essential for efficient substrate phosphorylation. Ca2+/CaM binding
   activates autophosphorylated eEF-2K by allosterically enhancing
   k(cat)(app) for peptide substrate phosphorylation by 10(3)-fold. Thr-348
   autophosphorylation results in a 25-fold increase in the specificity
   constant (k(cat)(app)/K-m(Pep-S)(app)), with equal contributions from
   k(cat)(app) and K-m(Pep-S)(app), suggesting that peptide substrate
   binding is partly impeded in the unphosphorylated enzyme. In cells,
   Thr-348 autophosphorylation appears to control the catalytic output of
   active eEF-2K, contributing more than 5-fold to its ability to promote
   eEF-2 phosphorylation. Fundamentally, eEF-2K activation appears to be
   analogous to an amplifier, where output volume may be controlled by
   either toggling the power switch (switching on the kinase) or altering
   the volume control (modulating stability of the active R-loop
   conformation). Because upstream signaling events have the potential to
   modulate either allosteric step, this mechanism allows for exquisite
   control of eEF-2K output.}},

Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{We report the preparation of Ni nanowire colloidal suspension that
   exhibits large light scattering changes when a magnetic field is
   applied. These changes occur during the application of alternating
   transversal magnetic fields. The intensity variation can easily be
   detected and measured since the light signal produced is very large with
   ratios much larger compared with signals obtained from light
   transmission through the nanowire colloidal suspension. Ni nanowires
   used for the experiments are about 1.2 mu m long and 50 nm in diameter;
   suspensions of 44 mu g/ml of these nanowires yield a scattering light
   variation ratio up to 35\% when subjected to transversal alternating
   magnetic fields of 10 G. The methodology proposed could be implemented
   to detect and characterize magnetic nanowires even at concentrations as
   low as 4.4 mu g/ml. Using finite element modeling, we observe that
   nanowires in a suspension scatter light depending strongly on the
   incidence angle of the applied light. From the finite element
   simulations, we also observe that nanowires may present
   plasmonic-antenna absorption effects that can be useful to indirectly
   measure nanowire properties, such as length and composition. (C) 2014

Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Quantum interference (QI) phenomena between electronic states in
   molecular circuits offer a new opportunity to design new types of
   molecular devices such as molecular sensors, interferometers, and
   thermoelectric devices. Controlling the QI effect is a key challenge for
   such applications. For the development of single molecular devices
   employing QI effects, a systematic study of the relationship between
   electronic structure and the quantum interference is needed. In order to
   uncover the essential topological requirements for the appearance of QI
   effects and the relationship between the QI-affected line shape of the
   transmission spectra and the electronic structures, we consider a
   homogeneous toy model where all on-site energies are identical and model
   four types of molecular junctions due to their topological
   connectivities. We systematically analyze their transmission spectra,
   density of states, and thermoelectric properties. Even without the
   degree of freedom for on-site energies an asymmetric Fano peak could be
   realized in the homogeneous systems with the cyclic configuration. We
   also calculate the thermoelectric properties of the model systems with
   and without fluctuation of on-site energies. Even under the fluctuation
   of the on-site energies, the finite thermoelectrics are preserved for
   the Fano resonance, thus cyclic configuration is promising for
   thermoelectric applications. This result also suggests the possibility
   to detect the cyclic configuration in the homogeneous systems and the
   presence of the QI features from thermoelectric measurements. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The interaction of thermal Ar plasma particles with Si and W surfaces is
   modeled using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. At plasma
   energies above the threshold for ablation, the ablation yield can be
   calculated directly from MD. For plasma energies below threshold, the
   ablation yield becomes exponentially low, and direct MD simulations are
   inefficient. Instead, we propose an integration method where the yield
   is calculated as a function of the Ar incident kinetic energy.
   Subsequent integration with a Boltzmann distribution at the temperature
   of interest gives the thermal ablation yield. At low plasma
   temperatures, the ablation yield follows an Arrhenius form in which the
   activation energy is shown to be the threshold energy for ablation.
   Interestingly, equilibrium material properties, including the surface
   and bulk cohesive energy, are not good predictors of the threshold
   energy for ablation. The surface vacancy formation energy is better, but
   is still not a quantitative predictor. An analysis of the trajectories
   near threshold shows that ablation occurs by different mechanisms on
   different material surfaces, and both the mechanism and the binding of
   surface atoms determine the threshold energy. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Systematic and evolutionary engineering of a xylose isomerase-based
   pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for efficient conversion yields}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Efficient xylose fermentation by yeast would improve the
   economical and sustainable nature of biofuels production from
   lignocellulosic biomass. However, the efficiency of xylose fermentation
   by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is suboptimal, especially in
   conversion yield, despite decades of research. Here, we present an
   improved performance of S. cerevisiae in xylose fermentation through
   systematic and evolutionary engineering approaches.
   Results: The engineering of S. cerevisiae harboring xylose
   isomerase-based pathway significantly improved the xylose fermentation
   performance without the need for intensive downstream pathway
   engineering. This strain contained two integrated copies of a mutant
   xylose isomerase, gre3 and pho13 deletion and XKS1 and S. stipitis tal1
   overexpression. This strain was subjected to rapid adaptive evolution to
   yield the final, evolved strain (SXA-R2P-E) which could efficiently
   convert xylose to ethanol with a yield of 0.45 g ethanol/g xylose, the
   highest yield reported to date. The xylose consumption and ethanol
   production rates, 0.98 g xylose g cell(-1) h(-1) and 0.44 g ethanol g
   cell(-1) h(-1), respectively, were also among the highest reported.
   During this process, the positive effect of a pho13 deletion was
   identified for a xylose isomerase-containing strain and resulted in up
   to an 8.2-fold increase in aerobic growth rate on xylose. Moreover,
   these results demonstrated that low inoculum size and the cell transfer
   at exponential phase was found to be the most effective adaptation
   strategy during a batch culture adaptation process.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the xylose isomerase pathway
   should be the pathway of choice for efficient xylose fermentation in S.
   cerevisiae as it can outperform strains with the oxidoreductase pathway
   in terms of yield and ethanol production and xylose consumption rates.
   Consequently, the strain developed in this study could significantly
   improve the prospect of biofuels production from lignocellulosic
   biomass.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Catheter ablation is important for treatment of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation (PAF). Limited animal and human studies suggest a
   correlation between electrode-tissue contact and radiofrequency lesion
   generation.
   OBJECTIVES The study sought to assess the safety and effectiveness of an
   irrigated, contact force (CF)-sensing catheter in the treatment of drug
   refractory symptomatic PAF.
   METHODS A prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study was conducted.
   Enrollment criteria included: >= 3 symptomatic episodes of PAF within 6
   months of enrollment and failure of >= 1 antiarrhythmic drug (Class I to
   IV). Ablation included pulmonary vein isolation with confirmed entrance
   block as procedural endpoint.
   RESULTS A total of 172 patients were enrolled at 21 sites, where 161
   patients had a study catheter inserted and 160 patients underwent
   radiofrequency application. Procedural-related serious adverse events
   occurring within 7 days of the procedure included tamponade (n = 4),
   pericarditis (n = 3), heart block (n = 1, prior to radiofrequency
   application), and vascular access complications (n = 4). By Kaplan-Meier
   analyses, 12-month freedom from atrial fibrillation/atrial
   flutter/atrial tachycardia recurrence was 72.5\%. The average CF per
   procedure was 17.9 +/- 9.4 g. When the CF employed was between
   investigator selected working ranges >= 80\% of the time during therapy,
   outcomes were 4.25 times more likely to be successful (p = 0.0054; 95\%
   confidence interval: 1.53 to 11.79).
   CONCLUSIONS The SMART-AF trial demonstrated that this irrigated
   CF-sensing catheter is safe and effective for the treatment of drug
   refractory symptomatic PAF, with no unanticipated device-related adverse
   events. The increased percent of time within investigator-targeted CF
   ranges correlates with increased freedom from arrhythmia recurrence.
   Stable CF during radiofrequency application increases the likelihood of
   12-month success. (THERMOCOOL (R) SMARTTOUCH (R) Catheter for Treatment

Abstract = {{We propose a partial-differential-equation-constrained (PDE-constrained)
   approach to the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) of Demkowicz and
   Gopalakrishnan (2010, 2011). This view opens the door to invite all the
   state-of-the-art PDE-constrained techniques to be part of the DPG
   framework, and hence enabling one to solve large-scale and difficult
   (nonlinear) problems efficiently. That is, our proposed method preserves
   all the attractive features of the DPG framework while enjoying all
   advances from the PDE-constrained optimization community. The proposed
   approach can be considered as a Rayleigh-Ritz method for the DPG minimum
   residual statement. It is equipped with a trust region inexact Newton
   conjugate gradient (TRINCG) method which prevents over-solving when
   optimization iterates are far away from the optimal solution but
   converges quadratically otherwise for sufficiently smooth residual. The
   PDE-constrained approach together with the TRINCG solver is therefore a
   robust iterative method for the DPG framework. It is robust in the sense
   that the approximate solution is improved after each optimization
   iterate until the algorithm converges to a local minimum of the
   residual. As numerically shown, it is also scalable in the sense that
   the number of Newton iterations remains constant as either the mesh or
   the solution order is refined. Moreover, the proposed approach solves
   neither the optimal test functions nor the original PDE directly, though
   the discretization of the latter is still necessary. The gradient and
   Hessian-vector product, which are required by the TRINCG solver, are
   explicitly derived for both abstract variational problems and viscous
   Burger equation. This reveals a fact that the complexity of each Newton
   iteration scales like O (N x n(CG)), where N and nCG are the number of
   unknowns and the number of conjugate iterations, respectively. Optimal
   h- and p- convergences of the proposed approach are demonstrated for
   Laplace and Helmholtz equations. Numerical results for the viscous
   Burger equation and the Euler equation of gas dynamics are very
   promising. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to investigate the sensitivity of
   electrodialysis performance to variations in voltage application and
   membrane type when treating brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO)
   concentrate waste, which typically exceeds multiple salt solubility
   limits. Synthetic BWRO concentrates from Arizona, Texas, and Florida of
   7890-18,600 mg/L total dissolved solids were prepared with 6-10 mg/L of
   polyphosphonate antiscalants. Experimentation was performed using a
   laboratory-scale electrodialyzer a nominal transfer area of 64 cm(2) per
   membrane. Flow, pressure, conductivity, temperature, and pH were
   measured continuously, and periodic process samples were analyzed for
   anion and cation concentrations. The three BWRO concentrates were
   successfully treated with stack voltage applications of 1.0-1.5
   V/cell-pair with initial current densities of 200-600 A/m(2) and final
   salinity removal ratios up to 98\%. This paper shows consistent specific
   energy consumption (approximately 0.03 kWh/m(3) per Volt/cell-pair
   applied per meq/L separated) for electrodialysis treatment for several
   concentrates across a range of salinity and composition. Successive
   electrodialysis treatment recovered more than 78\% of BWRO concentrate
   without precipitation, corresponding to calcite and dolomite saturation
   ratios of 15. These results demonstrate that electrodialysis processes
   can effectively minimize concentrate waste from BWRO processes, with
   simulated system recoveries up to 95\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Chemically doped graphene-based materials have recently been explored as
   a means to improve the performance of supercapacitors. In this work, we
   investigate the effects of 3d transition metals bound to vacancy sites
   in graphene with {[}BMIM]{[}PF6] ionic liquid on the interfacial
   capacitance; these results are compared to the pristine graphene case
   with particular attention to the relative contributions of the quantum
   and electric double layer capacitances. Our study highlights that the
   presence of metal-vacancy complexes significantly increases the
   availability of electronic states near the charge neutrality point,
   thereby enhancing the quantum capacitance drastically. In addition, the
   use of metal-doped graphene electrodes is found to only marginally
   influence the microstructure and capacitance of the electric double
   layer. Our findings indicate that metal-doping of graphene-like
   electrodes can be a promising route toward increasing the interfacial
   capacitance of electrochemical double layer capacitors, primarily by
   enhancing the quantum capacitance.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the first highly controllable assembly and rotation of
   silicon nanowires and nanomotors in suspension are reported. Si and Si
   composite nanowires are fabricated with precisely controlled dimensions
   via colloidal assisted catalytic etching. The nanowires can be rotated
   with deterministic speed and chirality. The rotation speed and
   orientation not only depend on the applied AC electric frequency, but
   also on the electronic type, geometry, surface coating, as well as the
   electric conductance of suspension mediums. Theoretical analysis is used
   to understand the rotation of Si nanowires, and also the electric
   resistivity of Si nanowires is determined from their mechanical
   rotation. The Si nanowires are precisely assembled into nanomotors that
   can be rotated with controlled speeds and orientations at prescribed
   locations. This work provides a new paradigm for designing and actuating
   various Si-based nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) devices, which are
   relevant to man-made nanomotors, nanorobots, and nanoengines.}},

Abstract = {{A strategy for capacity and cyclability enhancement of room-temperature
   sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries is reported by inserting a
   nanostructured, carbon-based interlayer between the sulfur cathode and
   the separator. The interlayer localizes the soluble polysulfide species
   and prevents its migration to the sodium anode. Electrochemical and
   spectroscopic characterizations along with thermodynamic analyses
   indicate that the charge/discharge of the Na-S cell involves complicated
   transition processes through a series of long-chain (Na2Sn, 4 <= n <= 8)
   and short-chain (Na2Sn, 1 <= n <= 4) sodium-polysulfide intermediates.
   The results obtained in this work show that the cell can provide a
   remarkable capacity of 400 Ah kg(-1) and an energy density of 720 Wh
   kg(-1) (based on the sulfur cathode) after 20 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Recent calculations and experimental data suggest that understanding the
   local ordering behavior of Ni/Mn will be critical to optimize the
   electrochemical properties of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) high voltage spinel.
   In this study, we systematically controlled the evolution of Ni and Mn
   ordering in LNMO samples by annealing them at 700 degrees C in air for
   different dwelling times, followed by quenching to room temperature. The
   long- and short-range ordering behavior of Ni and Mn were analyzed by
   combining neutron powder diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR) data. The results show that the fraction of ordered
   phase increases rapidly during initial annealing at 700 degrees C for 6
   h, and accompanied by decreasing amounts of secondary phases. Annealing
   longer than 6 h led to the growth in size of ordered domains (i.e.,
   increased segregation of ordered and disordered domains) along with a
   slow increase in the fraction of ordered phase. The dependence of open
   circuit voltages (OCVs) of the LNMO on the degree of ordering agrees
   well with recent calculations using the density functional theory. The
   increase in the degree of ordering increases the open circuit voltage
   (OCV) and the initial capacity but reduces cycle life and rate
   capability. The LNMO delivered optimal battery performances (capacity,
   cycle life, and rate capability) after annealing at 700 degrees C for 2
   h. This partially ordered sample showed the respective advantages from
   both disordered and ordered spinels: better spinel-phase purity (thus,
   higher initial capacity) from the ordered LNMO and better cycle life and
   rate capability from the disordered LNMO.}},

Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Coarse graining of membrane simulations by translating atomistic
   dynamics to densities and fields with Milestoning is discussed. The
   space of the membrane system is divided into cells and the different
   cells are characterized by order parameters presenting the number
   densities. The dynamics of the order parameters are probed with
   Milestoning. The methodology is illustrated here for a phospholipid
   membrane system (a hydrated bilayer of DOPC
   (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) lipid molecules). Significant
   inhomogeneity in membrane internal number density leads to complex free
   energy landscape and local maps of transition times. Dynamics and
   distributions of cavities within the membrane assist the permeation of
   nonpolar solutes such as xenon atoms. It is illustrated that
   quantitative and detailed dynamics of water transport through DOPC
   membrane can be analyzed using Milestoning with fields. The reaction
   space for water transport includes at least two slow variables: the
   normal to the membrane plane, and the water density. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Equations of state in the van der Waals genre suggest that saturated
   liquids should adhere to the following corresponding states principle
   (CSP): saturated liquids at the same reduced density (rho(R)= rho/rho c)
   have comparable dimensionless thermodynamic properties. This CSP is
   shown to be applicable to a variety of thermodynamic properties that
   include entropy of vaporization, cohesive energy density, thermal
   expansion coefficient, isothermal compressibility, thermal pressure
   coefficient, compressibility factor, temperature coefficient of the
   vapor pressure, heat capacity difference, and surface tension. For two
   classes of liquids, all properties rendered dimensionless by the proper
   choice of scaling variables superpose to form ``master curves{''} that
   illustrate the CSP. Using scaled particle theory, an improved van der
   Waals model is developed whose results are compared with existing
   experimental thermodynamic data in dimensionless form. Properly
   expressing thermodynamic properties in dimensionless form acts to
   consolidate and harmonize liquid state properties.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-metal anode degradation is one of the major challenges of
   lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, hindering their practical utility as
   next-generation rechargeable battery chemistry. The polysulfide
   migration and shuttling associated with Li-S batteries can induce
   heterogeneities of the lithium-metal surface because it causes
   passivation by bulk insulating Li2S particles/electrolyte decomposition
   products on a lithium-metal surface. This promotes lithium dendrite
   formation and leads to poor lithium cycling efficiency with complicated
   lithium surface chemistry. Here, we show copper acetate as a surface
   stabilizer for lithium metal in a polysulfide-rich environment of Li-S
   batteries. The lithium surface is protected from parasitic reactions
   with the organic electrolyte and the migrating polysulfides by an in
   situ chemical formation of a passivation film consisting of mainly
   Li2S/Li2S2/CuS/Cu2S and electrolyte decomposition products. This
   passivation film also suppresses lithium dendrite formation by
   controlling the lithium deposition sites, leading to a stabilized
   lithium surface characterized by a dendrite-free morphology and improved
   surface chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Pd-Au catalysts have shown exceptional performance for selective
   hydrogen production via HCOOH decomposition, a promising alternative to
   solve issues associated with hydrogen storage and distribution. In this
   study, we utilized temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reactive
   molecular beam scattering (RMBS) in an attempt to unravel the factors
   governing the catalytic properties of Pd-Au bimetallic surfaces for
   HCOOH decomposition. Our results show that Pd atoms at the Pd-Au surface
   are responsible for activating HCOOH molecules; however, the selectivity
   of the reaction is dictated by the identity of the surface metal atoms
   adjacent to the Pd atoms. Pd atoms that reside at Pd-Au interface sites
   tend to favor dehydrogenation of HCOOH, whereas Pd atoms in Pd(111)-like
   sites, which lack neighboring Au atoms, favor dehydration of HCOOH.
   These observations suggest that the reactivity and selectivity of HCOOH
   decomposition on Pd-Au catalysts can be tailored by controlling the
   arrangement of surface Pd and Au atoms. The findings in this study may
   prove informative for rational design of Pd-Au catalysts for associated
   reactions including selective HCOOH decomposition for hydrogen
   production and electro-oxidation of HCOOH in the direct formic acid fuel
   cell.}},

Abstract = {{Over decades, the theoretical and applied mechanics community has
   developed sophisticated approaches for analysing the behaviour of
   complex engineering systems. Most of these approaches have targeted
   systems in the transportation, materials, defence and energy industries.
   Applying and further developing engineering approaches for
   understanding, predicting and modulating the response of complicated
   biomedical processes not only holds great promise in meeting societal
   needs, but also poses serious challenges. This report, prepared for the
   US National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, aims to
   identify the most pressing challenges in biological sciences and
   medicine that can be tackled within the broad field of mechanics. This
   echoes and complements a number of national and international
   initiatives aiming at fostering interdisciplinary biomedical research.
   This report also comments on cultural/educational challenges.
   Specifically, this report focuses on three major thrusts in which we
   believe mechanics has and will continue to have a substantial impact.
   (i) Rationally engineering injectable nano/microdevices for imaging and
   therapy of disease. Within this context, we discuss nanoparticle carrier
   design, vascular transport and adhesion, endocytosis and tumour growth
   in response to therapy, as well as uncertainty quantification techniques
   to better connect models and experiments. (ii) Design of biomedical
   devices, including point-of-care diagnostic systems, model organ and
   multi-organ microdevices, and pulsatile ventricular assistant devices.
   (iii) Mechanics of cellular processes, including mechanosensing and
   mechanotransduction, improved characterization of cellular constitutive
   behaviour, and microfluidic systems for single-cell studies.}},

Abstract = {{Supported tungsten carbide is an efficient and vital nanomaterial for
   the development of high-performance, sensitive, and selective
   electrochemical sensors. In this work, tungsten carbide with tube-like
   nanostructures (WC NTs) supported platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) are
   synthesized and explored as an efficient catalyst toward electrochemical
   oxidation of oxalic acid for the first the time. The WC NTs supported
   PtNPs modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode is highly sensitive toward
   the electrochemical oxidation of oxalic acid. A large decrease in the
   oxidation overpotential (220 mV) and significant enhancement in the peak
   current compared to unmodified and Pt/C modified GC electrodes have been
   observed without using any redox mediator. Moreover, WC NTs supported
   PtNPs modified electrode possessed wide linear concentration ranges from
   0 to 125 nM and a higher sensitivity toward the oxidation of oxalic acid
   (80 nA/nM) achieved by the amperometry method. The present modified
   electrode showed an experimentally determined lowest detection limit
   (LOD) of 12 nM (S/N = 3). Further, WC NTs supported PtNPs electrode can
   be demonstrated to have an excellent selectivity toward the detection of
   oxalic acid in the presence of a 200-fold excess of major important
   interferents. The practical application of WC NTs supported PtNPs has
   also been demonstrated in the detection of oxalic acid in tomato fruit
   sample, by differential pulse voltammetry under optimized conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Amine scrubbing is a thermodynamically efficient and industrially proven
   method for carbon capture, but amine solvents can nitrosate in the
   desorber, forming potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines. The kinetics of
   reactions involving nitrite and monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine
   (DEA), methylethanolamine (MMEA), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) were
   determined under desorber conditions. The nitrosations of MEA, DEA, and
   MMEA are first order in nitrite, carbamate species, and hydronium ion.
   Nitrosation of MDEA, a tertiary amine, is not catalyzed by the addition
   of CO, since it cannot form a stable carbamate. Concentrated and CO,
   loaded MEA was blended with low concentrations of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)
   glycine (HeGly), hydroxyethyl-ethylenediamine (HEEDA), and DEA,
   secondary amines common in MEA degradation. Nitrosamine yield was
   proportional to the concentration of secondary amine and was a function
   of CO, loading and temperature. Blends of tertiary amines with
   piperazine (PZ) showed n-nitrosopiperazine (MNPZ) yields close to unity,
   validating the slow nitrosation rates hypothesized for tertiary amines.
   These results provide a useful tool for estimating nitrosamine
   accumulation over a range of amine solvents.}},

Abstract = {{Direct writing of hierarchical micro/nanofibers have recently gained
   popularity in flexible/stretchable electronics due to its low cost,
   simple process and high throughput. A kinetically controlled
   mechanoelectrospinning (MES) is developed to directly write diversified
   hierarchical micro/nanofibers in a continuous and programmable manner.
   Unlike conventional near-field electrospinning, our MES method
   introduces a mechanical drawing force, to simultaneously enhance the
   positioning accuracy and morphology controllability. The MES is
   predominantly controlled by the substrate speed, the nozzle-to-substrate
   distance, and the applied voltage. As a demonstration, smooth straight,
   serpentine, self-similar, and bead-on-string structures are
   direct-written on silicon/elastomer substrates with a resolution of 200
   nm. It is believed that MES can promote the low-cost, high precision
   fabrication of flexible/stretchable electronics or enable the direct
   writing of the sacrificial structures for nanoscale lithography.}},

Abstract = {{Animals have multiple senses through which they detect their
   surroundings and often integrate sensory information across different
   modalities to generate perceptions {[}1, 2]. Animal communication,
   likewise, often consists of signals containing stimuli processed by
   different senses {[}3-6]. Stimuli with different physical forms (i.e.,
   from different sensory modalities) travel at different speeds {[}7]. As
   a consequence, multimodal stimuli simultaneously emitted at a source can
   arrive at a receiver at different times. Such differences in arrival
   time can provide unique information about the distance to the source
   {[}8, 9]. Male tungara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) call from ponds to
   attract females and to repel males. Production of the sound incidentally
   creates ripples on the water surface, providing a multimodal cue {[}10].
   We tested whether male frogs attend to distance-dependent cues created
   by a calling rival and whether their response depends on crossmodal
   comparisons. In a first experiment, we showed distance-dependent changes
   in vocal behavior: males responded more strongly with decreasing
   distance to a mimicked rival. In a second experiment, we showed that
   males can discriminate between relatively near and far rivals by using a
   combination of unimodal cues, specifically amplitude changes of sound
   and water waves, as well as crossmodal differences in arrival time. Our
   data reveal that animals can compare the arrival time of simultaneously
   emitted multimodal cues to obtain information on relative distance to a
   source. We speculate that communicative benefits from crossmodal
   comparison may have been an important driver of the evolution of
   elaborate multimodal displays {[}11, 12].}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic and plasmonic properties combined in a single nanoparticle
   provide a synergy that is advantageous in a number of biomedical
   applications including contrast enhancement in novel magnetomotive
   imaging modalities, simultaneous capture and detection of circulating
   tumor cells (CTCs), and multimodal molecular imaging combined with
   photothermal therapy of cancer cells. These applications have stimulated
   significant interest in development of protocols for synthesis of

   present a novel protocol for synthesis of such hybrid nanoparticles that
   is based on an oil-in-water microemulsion method. The unique feature of
   the protocol described herein is synthesis of magneto-plasmonic
   nanoparticles of various sizes from primary blocks which also have
   magneto-plasmonic characteristics. This approach yields nanoparticles
   with a high density of magnetic and plasmonic functionalities which are
   uniformly distributed throughout the nanoparticle volume. The hybrid
   nanoparticles can be easily functionalized by attaching antibodies

Title = {{C-DIIVINE: No-reference image quality assessment based on local
   magnitude and phase statistics of natural scenes}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{It is widely known that the wavelet coefficients of natural scenes
   possess certain statistical regularities which can be affected by the
   presence of distortions. The DIIVINE (Distortion Identification-based
   Image Verity and Integrity Evaluation) algorithm is a successful
   no-reference image quality assessment (NR IQA) algorithm, which
   estimates quality based on changes in these regularities. However,
   DIIVINE operates based on real-valued wavelet coefficients, whereas the
   visual appearance of an image can be strongly determined by both the
   magnitude and phase information.
   In this paper, we present a complex extension of the DIIVINE algorithm
   (called C-DIIVINE), which blindly assesses image quality based on the
   complex Gaussian scale mixture model corresponding to the complex
   version of the steerable pyramid wavelet transform. Specifically, we
   applied three commonly used distribution models to fit the statistics of
   the wavelet coefficients: (1) the complex generalized Gaussian
   distribution is used to model the wavelet coefficient magnitudes, (2)
   the generalized Gaussian distribution is used to model the coefficients'
   relative magnitudes, and (3) the wrapped Cauchy distribution is used to
   model the coefficients' relative phases. All these distributions have
   characteristic shapes that are consistent across different natural
   images but change significantly in the presence of distortions. We also
   employ the complex wavelet structural similarity index to measure
   degradation of the correlations across image scales, which serves as an
   important indicator of the subbands' energy distribution and the loss of
   alignment of local spectral components contributing to image structure.
   Experimental results show that these complex extensions allow C-DIIVINE
   to yield a substantial improvement in predictive performance as compared
   to its predecessor, and highly competitive performance relative to other
   recent no-reference algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Implementing geological carbon sequestration at a large scale to
   mitigate anthropogenic emissions involves the injection of carbon
   dioxide (CO2) into deep brine-filled structures. An alternative to
   injecting CO2 as a buoyant phase is to dissolve it into brine extracted
   from the storage formation, then inject the CO2-saturated brine into the
   storage formation. The CO2-concentration front shape, when it reaches
   the saturation-pressure contour, defines the maximal areal extent of
   CO2-saturated brine and thus the aquifer-utilization efficiency.
   The heterogeneity of the aquifer reduces the utilization efficiency
   significantly. We illustrate by comparing the utilization efficiency in
   a homogeneous-permeability field with that in uncorrelated and
   correlated heterogeneous fields under the same well control. The example
   cases yield significant reductions of the utilization efficiency.
   We develop an optimal-control strategy of the injection/extraction rates
   to maximize the utilization efficiency for heterogeneous aquifers. We
   propose two objective functions: One seeks to improve the areal sweep by
   minimizing the mismatch between the CO2-concentration front and the
   saturation-pressure contour; the other directly formulates the
   utilization efficiency while penalizing zones that contain gas-phase
   CO2. Both approaches have improved the aquifer-utilization efficiency by
   delaying the arrival of the dissolved CO2 front at the contour of
   saturation pressure.
   Heterogeneity plays an important role in determining the location of the
   saturation-pressure contour within the storage formation. For a simple
   example domain, we propose a well-pattern orientation strategy by
   placing line-drive injectors in a high-permeability zone and extractors
   in a low-permeability zone, so that the saturation-pressure contour is
   closer to the extractors and thus increases the aquifer utilization
   efficiency. Illustration of this concept in the correlated heterogeneous
   field shows an improvement of the utilization efficiency. When combined
   with the optimal control of injection/extraction rates, the increase in
   the utilization efficiency almost compensates the reduction because of
   the heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of cloud computing services has led to an increased
   interest in the technology among the general public and enterprises
   marketing these services. Although there is a need for studies with a
   managerial relevance for this emerging market, the lack of market
   analysis hampers such investigations. Therefore, this study focuses on
   the end-user market for cloud computing in Korea. We conduct a
   quantitative analysis to show consumer adoption behavior for these
   services, particularly infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Bayesian
   mixed logit model and the multivariate probit model are used to analyze
   the data collected by a conjoint survey. From this analysis, we find
   that the service fee and stability are the most critical adoption
   factors. We also present an analysis on the relationship between
   terminal devices and IaaS, classified by core attributes such as price,
   stability, and storage capacity. From these relationships, we find that
   larger storage capacity is more important for mobile devices such as
   laptops than desktops. Based on the results of the analysis, this study
   also recommends useful strategies to enable enterprise managers to focus
   on more appropriate service attributes, and to target suitable terminal

Abstract = {{An optimal control approach for a wind turbine drivetrain with a

   cope with wind speed variations. Based on the authors' preliminary
   study, the gear ratios of the variable ratio gearbox were carefully
   selected to maximize the wind energy capture. In this paper, a new
   control approach is proposed to achieve both extended gear service life
   and optimal energy harvesting. This new approach finds the gear shifting
   sequence that will minimize the tangential force on the gear tooth while
   maximizing the wind energy capture. The wind turbine drivetrain with a

Abstract = {{Aleatory variability in ground-motion prediction, represented by the
   standard deviation (sigma) of a ground-motion prediction equation,
   exerts a very strong influence on the results of probabilistic
   seismic-hazard analysis (PSHA). This is especially so at the low annual
   exceedance frequencies considered for nuclear facilities; in these
   cases, even small reductions in sigma can have a marked effect on the
   hazard estimates. Proper separation and quantification of aleatory
   variability and epistemic uncertainty can lead to defensible reductions
   in sigma. One such approach is the single-station sigma concept, which
   removes that part of sigma corresponding to repeatable site-specific
   effects. However, the site-to-site component must then be constrained by
   site-specific measurements or else modeled as epistemic uncertainty and
   incorporated into the modeling of site effects. The practical
   application of the single-station sigma concept, including the
   characterization of the dynamic properties of the site and the
   incorporation of site-response effects into the hazard calculations, is
   illustrated for a PSHA conducted at a rock site under consideration for
   the potential construction of a nuclear power plant.}},

Abstract = {{The use of short time trajectory fragments to enhance sampling of
   kinetics is discussed. It is argued that partitioning of phase space
   with interfaces that are called milestones and conducting a large number
   of short time trajectories between these interfaces is a highly
   efficient and accurate method to calculate thermodynamics and kinetics.
   The method of Milestoning, which is a theory and an algorithm, enables
   the rapid calculations of fluxes, stationary distributions, and moments
   of the mean first passage time. It is based on sub-nanosecond
   trajectories between cell partitions (milestones) that are defined in
   coarse space. While the method was applied in the past to highly complex
   systems, we illustrate it here on a pedagogical two-dimensional system
   using dividers of Voronoi cells as milestones.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{8, SI}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Past research has shown that blast-loaded steel stud walls exhibit a
   range of different failure mechanisms depending on the stud and track
   section properties, connection details, and sheathing characteristics.
   To date, few studies have addressed the computational modeling of these
   systems. Because large-scale blast tests are expensive and logistically
   difficult, computational models are needed to evaluate different design
   options prior to carrying out full-scale experiments. In this paper, the
   authors present finite-element models that capture the peak load and
   deformation capacity of steel stud wall systems, accounting for the
   failure modes observed in past testing. The proposed models strike a
   balance between level of refinement and computational efficiency. These
   models were validated against data collected from an extensive
   laboratory testing program. Based on observations from both the lab
   tests and computational simulations, recommendations are given for
   improving the large-deformation response of these systems. Through
   simple and inexpensive design modifications, the capacity of steel stud
   walls can be made to far exceed existing response limits. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This work investigates the interactions of a polycationic nanocarrier

   efficiently bind siRNA for polymer/siRNAmass ratios less than 1. A
   method to prepare fluorescently labeled polycationic nanocarriers is
   presented. The fluorescently labeled polycationic nanocarriers are used
   to investigate cellular internalization with RAW264.7 murine macrophage
   cells. Flow cytometry demonstrates that the uptake increased with
   nanoparticle concentration and incubation time. Confocal microscopy
   confirmed internalization of fluorescently labeled nanoparticles. The
   investigation of siRNA-induced knockdown demonstrates that higher

Title = {{Skin-friction drag reduction in the turbulent regime using
   random-textured hydrophobic surfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Technologies for reducing hydrodynamic skin-friction drag have a huge
   potential for energy-savings in applications ranging from propulsion of
   marine vessels to transporting liquids through pipes. The majority of
   previous experimental studies using hydrophobic surfaces have
   successfully shown skin-friction drag reduction in the laminar and
   transitional flow regimes (typically Reynolds numbers less than similar
   or equal to 10(6) for external flows). However, this hydrophobicity
   induced drag reduction is known to diminish with increasing Reynolds
   numbers in experiments involving wall bounded turbulent flows. Using
   random-textured hydrophobic surfaces (fabricated using large-length
   scalable thermal spray processes) on a flat plate geometry, we present
   water-tunnel test data with Reynolds numbers ranging from 10(6) to 9 x
   10(6) that show sustained skin-friction drag reduction of 20\%-30\% in
   such turbulent flow regimes. Furthermore, we provide evidence that apart
   from the formation of a Cassie state and hydrophobicity, we also need a
   low surface roughness and an enhanced ability of the textured surface to
   retain trapped air, for sustained drag reduction in turbulent flow
   regimes. Specifically, for the hydrophobic test surfaces of the present
   and previous studies, we show that drag reduction seen at lower Reynolds
   numbers diminishes with increasing Reynolds number when the surface
   roughness of the underlying texture becomes comparable to the viscous
   sublayer thickness. Conversely, test data show that textures with
   surface roughness significantly smaller than the viscous sublayer
   thickness and textures with high porosity show sustained drag reduction
   in the turbulent flow regime. The present experiments represent a
   significant technological advancement and one of the very few
   demonstrations of skin-friction reduction in the turbulent regime using
   random-textured hydrophobic surfaces in an external flow configuration.
   The scalability of the fabrication method, the passive nature of this
   surface technology, and the obtained results in the turbulent regime
   make such hydrophobic surfaces a potentially attractive option for
   hydrodynamic skin-friction drag reduction. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   phantoms show that the probe and system can extract absorption and
   scattering coefficients with less than 10\% error. As the goal is to use
   the instrument for the clinical early detection of skin cancer,
   preliminary clinical data are also presented, which indicates our

Abstract = {{The saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, is a fundamental
   characteristic of subsurface flow and the hydrologic cycle. However,
   direct measurement of K-s is time consuming. Recently, air permeability
   measurements at 50 and 100 cm of H2O tension, a relatively dry condition
   in coarse and medium-textured soils, have been used to estimate K-s. In
   this short communication, we present a theoretical framework for
   relating K-s to k(a)(phi), the air permeability as a function of
   porosity, phi, under completely dry conditions. We used power-law
   scaling from continuum percolation theory to develop a theoretical
   relationship between K-s and k(a)(phi). Our result, similar in form to a
   published logarithmic equation with empirical coefficients, gives a
   physical interpretation to these empirical coefficients.}},

   propulsion asymmetries, with some subjects relying more on the paretic
   leg and others on the nonparetic leg. The goal of this study was to
   assess whether analyzing propulsion asymmetry can help distinguish
   between improved paretic leg coordination versus nonparetic leg
   compensation.
   Methods: Three-dimensional forward dynamics simulations were developed
   for two post-stroke hemiparetic subjects walking at identical speeds
   before/after rehabilitation with opposite changes in propulsion
   asymmetry. Changes in the individual muscle contributions to forward
   propulsion were examined.
   Findings: The major source of increased forward propulsion in both
   subjects was from the ankle plantarflexors. How they were utilized
   differed and appears related to changes in propulsion asymmetry. Subject
   A increased propulsion generated from the paretic plantarflexors, while
   Subject B increased propulsion generated from the nonparetic
   plantarflexors. Each subject's strategy to increase speed also included
   differences in other muscle groups (e.g., hamstrings) that did not
   appear to be related to propulsion asymmetry.
   Interpretation: The results of this study highlight how speed cannot be
   used to elucidate underlying muscle coordination changes following
   rehabilitation. In contrast, propulsion asymmetry appears to provide
   insight into changes in plantarflexor output affecting propulsion
   generation and may be useful in monitoring rehabilitation outcomes. (C)

Abstract = {{Multicast device-to-device (D2D) transmission is important for
   applications like local file transfer in commercial networks and is also
   a required feature in public safety networks. In this paper we propose a
   tractable baseline multicast D2D model, and use it to analyze important
   multicast metrics like the coverage probability, mean number of covered
   receivers and throughput. In addition, we examine how the multicast
   performance would be affected by certain factors like dynamics (due to
   e. g., mobility) and network assistance. Take the mean number of covered
   receivers as an example. We find that simple repetitive transmissions
   help but the gain quickly diminishes as the number of repetitions
   increases. Meanwhile, dynamics and network assistance (i.e., allowing
   the network to relay the multicast signals) can help cover more
   receivers. We also explore how to optimize multicasting, e. g. by
   choosing the optimal multicast rate and the optimal number of
   retransmission times.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advancements in surfactants for chemical enhanced oil recovery
   (EOR) are presented. For oils with a high equivalent alkane carbon
   number (EACN), surfactants with very large hydrophobes are needed to
   obtain the ultra-low interfacial tensions needed to reduce the residual
   oil saturation to nearly zero. The need increases at high temperature.
   Furthermore, these large hydrophobes need to be branched to promote
   formation of microemulsions with low to moderate viscosity as opposed to
   gels or other viscous structures that cause high surfactant retention.
   We show that such surfactants can be made from more than one type of
   hydrophobe in the form of either alkoxy sulfates or carboxylates. The
   carboxylates have the advantage of better stability at high temperature.
   Both the sulfates and carboxylates can be easily tailored to specific
   reservoir conditions and oils by adjusting the number of ethylene oxide
   (EO) or propylene oxide (PO) groups in the surfactant. A new correlation
   has been developed using an extensive data set taking into account the
   effects of PO number, EO number, temperature, brine salinity and the
   EACN of the oil on the optimum hydrophobe size. These new developments
   have enabled us to address a much wider range of conditions of oil
   characteristics, reservoir temperature, salinity and hardness level.
   Furthermore, the new surfactants are competitive in cost with previous
   EOR surfactants. Thus, these new developments have greatly advanced the
   commercial potential of chemical EOR. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Quantification of the effects of bed lamination and wellbore deviation
   on the interpretation of formation-tester measurements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{177-186}},

Abstract = {{Formation-tester measurements (FTM) acquired in thinly bedded formations
   and in highly deviated wells often show a large pressure drop during the
   drawdown period of a pressure-transient test. The measured large
   pressure drop can be an indication of a low permeability layer at the
   probe location. We invoke the effects of bed boundaries to explain
   additional pressure drop in the FTMs. An accurate analysis of the FTMs
   requires simulating mud-filtrate invasion prior to the
   pressure-transient test. Specifically, the interplay between gravity,
   capillary, and viscous forces leads to a highly non-symmetric fluid
   distribution around the wellbore perimeter in deviated wells. In this
   condition, it becomes crucial to have depth control and perform fluid
   sampling at a suitable probe location with respect to the perimeter of
   the wellbore. A three-dimensional (3D) compositional fluid-flow
   simulator is employed to simulate mud-filtrate invasion and subsequently
   FTMs in deviated wells. The simulator is specifically designed for
   problems where the greatest variations occur in the vicinity of the
   wellbore. We test the accuracy of the algorithm with a series of
   drawdown-buildup tests in highly deviated wells; a comparison of results
   obtained with the available analytical solutions and the numerical
   simulator shows a very good agreement. Subsequently, using the developed
   simulator, we study invasion, pressure transient tests after invasion,
   and fluid sampling after invasion. Results show that invasion in a
   high-permeability formation causes non-symmetric distribution of fluid
   around the wellbore of a deviated well. Simulation results confirm that
   a probe-type FT records significant pressure drops when it is placed at
   the vertical vicinity of the well; this effect leads to a lower measured
   permeability compared to the actual permeability. It was also found that
   pressure drop during drawdown is affected by invasion; pressure drop in
   invaded formations is greater than in un-invaded formations. We also
   quantify cleanup time for sampling with a probe-type FT deployed in
   deviated wells. Results show that the cleanup is achieved faster when
   the probe is located at the high side of the well. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper examines the mapping of algorithms encountered when solving
   dense linear systems and linear least-squares problems to a custom
   Linear Algebra Processor. Specifically, the focus is on Cholesky, LU
   (with partial pivoting), and QR factorizations and their blocked
   algorithms. As part of the study, we expose the benefits of redesigning
   floating point units and their surrounding datapaths to support these
   complicated operations. We show how adding moderate complexity to the
   architecture greatly alleviates complexities in the algorithm. We study
   design tradeoffs and the effectiveness of architectural modifications to
   demonstrate that we can improve power and performance efficiency to a
   level that can otherwise only be expected of full-custom ASIC designs. A
   feasibility study of inner kernels is extended to blocked level and
   shows that, at block level, the Linear Algebra Core (LAC) can achieve
   high efficiencies with up to 45 GFLOPS/W for both Cholesky and LU
   factorization, and over 35 GFLOPS/W for QR factorization. While
   maintaining such efficiencies, our extensions to the MAC units can
   achieve up to 10, 12, and 20 percent speedup for the blocked algorithms

Abstract = {{Long-Term Outcome of AF Ablation in MMV Patients. Introduction: It is
   unclear whether extended pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) plus
   nonpulmonary vein (non-PV) trigger elimination prevents more arrhythmia
   recurrence than PVAI alone in patients with mechanical mitral valve
   (MMV) undergoing AF ablation. This study compared the efficacy and
   long-term outcome of 2 ablation strategies-PVAI alone versus extended
   PVAI plus non-PV trigger elimination-for the treatment of AF in patients
   with MMV.
   Methods and Results: One hundred and nine consecutive AF patients with
   MMV were divided into 2 groups: standard PVAI was performed in group 1
   (N = 45); in group 2 (N = 64) PVAI was extended to the LA posterior
   wall, LA septum, and CS; and all non-PV triggers were eliminated.
   Patients were followed up for 3 years. At the 12th month, 7 (15.6\%)
   patients in group 1, and 39 (60.9\%) patients in group 2 were arrhythmia
   free (log-rank P < 0.001). Four patients (8.9\%; 3 cases of AT and 1
   case of AF) from group 1, and 12 patients (18.8\%; 9 cases of AT, and 3
   cases of AFL) from group 2 experienced very late recurrence. At 36 +/- 7
   months follow-up, the cumulative recurrence after a single procedure was
   42/45 (93.3\%) in group 1, and 37/64 (57.8\%) in group 2 (log-rank P <
   0.001).
   Conclusion: Compared with the standard PVAI alone, a strategy including
   extended PVAI and non-PV trigger elimination is associated with a higher
   12-month and long-term arrhythmia-free survival in patients with MMV
   undergoing AF ablation. Very late recurrence may occur years after the
   initial procedure with focal AT as the most common type of recurrent
   arrhythmia.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider algorithms for modeling complex processes in
   porous media that include fluid and structure interactions. Numerous
   field applications would benefit from a better understanding and
   integration of porous flow and solid deformation. Important applications
   in environmental and petroleum engineering include carbon sequestration,
   surface subsidence, pore collapse, cavity generation, hydraulic
   fracturing, thermal fracturing, wellbore collapse, sand production,
   fault activation, and waste disposal, while similar issues arise in
   biosciences and chemical sciences as well. Here, we consider solving
   iteratively the coupling of flow and mechanics. We employ mixed finite
   element method for flow and a continuous Galerkin method for elasticity.
   For single-phase flow, we demonstrate the convergence and convergence
   rates for two widely used schemes, the undrained split and the fixed
   stress split. We discuss the extension of the fixed stress iterative
   coupling scheme to an equation of state compositional flow model coupled
   with elasticity and a single-phase poroelasticity model on general
   hexahedral grids. Computational results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss Economic Model Predictive Control (E-MPC) in
   the context of buildings with active energy storage. In particular, we
   propose a strategy for the optimal control of building Heating,
   Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems with chilled water
   thermal energy storage (TES). Owing to the multiple time scale dynamic
   behavior of buildings, coupled with the need to account for potentially
   extended forecasts of disturbances (e.g., weather, energy prices), the
   implementation of a centralized E-MPC must consider a relatively long
   prediction horizon. In turn, this results in computational difficulties
   that impede on real-time implementation. Computational complexity is
   further increased by the presence of integer decision variables, related
   to on/off states and operating modes in the HVAC and TES systems. In
   response to these challenges, we introduce a novel hierarchical E-MPC
   framework based on (i) establishing the optimal operation of the TES by
   solving a dynamic scheduling problem in the slow time scale, and (ii)
   using a control scheme with a shorter horizon in the fast time scale,
   which addresses objectives related to maintaining the indoor air
   temperature within comfort bounds at all times during the day. A
   simulation case study concerning the operation of a TES system at the
   University of Texas Thermal Facade Laboratory is presented, showing
   excellent computational and control performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Economic model predictive control (EMPC) has recently gained popularity
   for managing energy consumption in buildings that are exposed to
   non-constant electricity prices, such as time-of-use prices or real-time
   prices. These electricity prices are employed directly in the objective
   function of the EMPC problem. This paper considers how electricity
   prices can be designed in order to achieve a specific objective, which
   in this case is minimizing peak electricity demand. A primal-dual
   formulation of the EMPC problem is presented that is used to determine
   optimal prices that minimize peak demand. The method is demonstrated on
   a simulated community of 900 residential homes to create a pricing
   structure that minimizes the peak demand of the community of homes. The
   pricing structure shows that homes should be given a 1-h peak demand
   duration, and that the peak prices given to the homes should be spread
   unevenly across 6 h of the afternoon. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Directly photopatternable interfaces are introduced that facilitate
   two-dimensional spatial control of block copolymer (BCP) orientation in
   thin films. Copolymers containing an acid labile monomer were
   synthesized, formulated with a photoacid generator (PAG), and coated to
   create grafted surface treatments (GSTs). These as-cast GST films are
   either inherently neutral or preferential (but not both) to
   lamella-forming poly(styrene-block-trimethylsilylstyrene) (PS-b-PTMSS).
   Subsequent contact printing and baking produced GSTs with submicron
   chemically patterned gratings. The catalytic reaction of the photoacid
   generated in the UV-exposed regions of the GSTs changed the interfacial
   interactions between the BCP and the GST in one of two ways: from
   neutral to preferential ({''}N2P{''}) or preferential to neutral
   ({''}P2N{''}). When PS-b-PTMSS was thermally annealed between a
   chemically patterned GST and a top coat, alternating regions of
   perpendicular and parallel BCP lamellae were formed.}},

Abstract = {{Jilin oilfield is conducting the first large-scale demonstration project
   on CO 2 storage and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the northeast of
   China. A comprehensive monitoring program has been designed and deployed
   in the target reservoir of block H-59 using a wide range of techniques
   to monitor the injection and production systems, the CO2 migration
   fronts, and potential CO 2 leakage pathways. Tube fault detection,
   corrosion inhibitors, anti-CO2 corrosion cement, and production dynamic
   analysis have been adopted to guarantee the safety at the well site. CO
   2 movement in the reservoir is detected mainly by gas tracer, electric
   spontaneous potential measurement, and fluid sampling. Near-surface
   environmental monitoring is also conducted around the injection site.
   Field experience has shown that the monitoring targets should be focused
   on the reservoir, near-surface, and injection and production systems.
   Applying monitoring techniques to ensure the integrity of wellbores can
   not only prevent the leakage of CO2, but also avoid the blind expansion
   of monitoring program scopes. It is reliable and economical to take full
   advantage of techniques based on wellbores to monitor CO2 movement in
   oil reservoirs with dense well patterns. Up to April 2013, nearly 21.7 x
   10(4) tons of CO2 has been injected without obvious leakage caused by
   integrity failure of wells or the geological structure of reservoir.
   More than 96\% of injected CO2 has been safely stored with the rest of
   injected CO2 normally breakthrough in the production wells. The
   preliminary monitoring experience obtained can provide valuable guidance
   for the future enlarged Jilin project and other CO2 EOR and storage
   operations. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \&

   typically require that the initial product state estimates have
   sufficient accuracy for satisfactory control. In this paper, we use
   historical process data and apply single observation just-in-time
   adaptive disturbance estimation (JADE) to find the initial product state
   estimates. Single observation JADE with random selection, high-frequency
   sampling, and exclusion of the earliest data from the average is shown
   to provide satisfactory initial product state estimates. The effect of
   initial state estimate accuracy is demonstrated by several simulation
   and industrial data examples. We also provide a method to estimate
   relative confidence between individual product state estimates,
   information that may be used to determine assignment of process error
   between the tool and product state.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is a powerful and simple method
   for full field imaging of blood flow. However, the depth dependence and
   the degree of multiple scattering have not been thoroughly investigated.
   We employ three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of photon
   propagation combined with high resolution vascular anatomy to
   investigate these two issues. We found that 95\% of the detected signal
   comes from the top 700 mu m of tissue. Additionally, we observed that
   single-intravascular scattering is an accurate description of photon
   sampling dynamics, but that regions of interest (ROIs) in areas free of
   obvious surface vessels had fewer intravascular scattering events than
   ROI over resolved surface vessels. Furthermore, we observed that the
   local vascular anatomy can strongly affect the depth dependence of LSCI.
   We performed simulations over a wide range of intravascular and
   extravascular scattering properties to confirm the applicability of
   these results to LSCI imaging over a wide range of visible and
   near-infrared wavelengths. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a

Abstract = {{TiO2 is being widely explored as an active resistive switching (RS)
   material for resistive random access memory. We report a detailed
   analysis of the RS characteristics of single-crystal anatase-TiO2 thin
   films epitaxially grown on silicon by atomic layer deposition. We
   demonstrate that although the valence change mechanism is responsible
   for the observed RS, single-crystal anatase-TiO2 thin films show
   electrical characteristics that are very different from the usual
   switching behaviors observed for polycrystalline or amorphous TiO2 and
   instead very similar to those found in electrochemical metallization
   memory. In addition, we demonstrate highly stable and reproducible
   quantized conductance that is well controlled by application of a
   compliance current and that suggests the localized formation of
   conducting Magneli-like nanophases. The quantized conductance observed
   results in multiple well-defined resistance states suitable for
   implementation of multilevel memory cells.}},

Abstract = {{The success of isolating small flakes of atomically thin layers through
   mechanical exfoliation has triggered enormous research interest in
   graphene and other two-dimensional materials. For device applications,
   however, controlled large-area synthesis of highly crystalline
   monolayers with a low density of electronically active defects is
   imperative. Here, we demonstrate the electrical imaging of dendritic
   ad-layers and grain boundaries in monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)
   grown by a vapor transport technique using microwave impedance
   microscopy. The micrometer-sized precipitates in our films, which appear
   as a second layer of MoS2 in conventional height and optical
   measurements, show similar to 2 orders of magnitude higher conductivity
   than that of the single layer. The zigzag grain boundaries, on the other
   hand, are shown to be more resistive than the crystalline grains,
   consistent with previous studies. Our ability to map the local
   electrical properties in a rapid and nondestructive manner is highly
   desirable for optimizing the growth process of large-scale MoS2 atomic
   layers.}},

Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic surfaces are of immense scientific and technological
   interests for a broad range of applications. However, a major challenge
   remains in developing scalable methodologies that enable
   superhydrophobic coatings on versatile substrates with a combination of
   strong mechanical stability, optical transparency, and even
   stretchability. Herein, we developed a scalable methodology to versatile
   hydrophobic surfaces that combine with strong mechanical stability,
   optical transparency, and stretchability by using a self-assembled
   hydrogel as the template to in situ generate silica microstructures and
   subsequent silanization. The superhydrophobic coatings can be enabled on
   virtually any substrates via large-area deposition techniques like dip
   coating. Transparent surfaces with optical transmittance as high as 9896
   were obtained. Moreover, the coatings exhibit superior mechanical
   flexibility and robustness that it can sustain contact angles similar to
   160 degrees even after 5000 cycles of mechanically stretching at 100\%
   strain. The multifunctional surfaces can be used as screen filters and
   sponges for the oil/water separation that can selectively absorb oils up
   to 40X their weight.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of suppressing the scattering cross section of an object
   is subject to fundamental physical bounds imposed by causality and
   passivity. Global cloaking limitations have been recently derived, which
   imply that any linear, causal and passive cloak necessarily increases
   the global scattering, integrated over the whole electromagnetic
   spectrum, compared to the uncloaked object. Here, we expand on this
   topic, discussing in detail an interesting exception to this limit
   represented by cloaks with static diamagnetism. In this context, we
   explore the potential of superconducting materials to realize global and
   local reduction of the scattering cross section. The concepts of
   plasmonic and mantle cloaking are extended to superconductors, realizing
   strong and tunable invisibility, with some unique properties stemming
   from the peculiar electrodynamics of superconductors. We conclude by
   qualitatively discussing a possible method to derive more stringent
   local bounds on cloaking. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The concept of a nano-actuator that uses ferroelectric switching to
   generate enhanced displacements is explored using a phase-field model.
   The actuator has a ground state in the absence of applied electric field
   that consists of polarized domains oriented to form a flux closure. When
   electric field is applied, the polarization reorients through
   ferroelectric switching and produces strain. The device is mechanically
   biased by a substrate and returns to the ground state when electric
   field is removed, giving a repeatable actuation cycle. The mechanical
   strains which accompany ferroelectric switching are several times
   greater than the strains attained due to the piezoelectric effect alone.
   We also demonstrate a second design of actuator in which the
   displacements are further increased by the bending of a ferroelectric
   beam. Phase-field modeling is used to track the evolution of domain
   patterns in the devices during the actuation cycle, and to study the
   design parameters so as to enhance the achievable actuation strains.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) retain the ability to undergo
   modulation in their phenotypic continuum, ranging from a mature
   contractile state to a proliferative, secretory state. vSMC
   differentiation is modulated by a complex array of microenvironmental
   cues, which include the biochemical milieu of the cells and the
   architecture and stiffness of the extracellular matrix. In this study,
   we demonstrate that by using UV-assisted capillary force lithography
   (CFL) to engineer a polyurethane substratum of defined nanotopography
   and stiffness, we can facilitate the differentiation of cultured vSMCs,
   reduce their inflammatory signature, and potentially promote the optimal
   functioning of the vSMC contractile and cytoskeletal machinery.
   Specifically, we found that the combination of medial tissue-like
   stiffness (11 MPa) and anisotropic nanotopography (ridge width\_groove
   width\_ridge height of 800\_800\_600 nm) resulted in significant
   upregulation of calponin, desmin, and smoothelin, in addition to the
   downregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, tissue factor,
   interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Further, our
   results allude to the mechanistic role of the RhoA/ROCK pathway and
   caveolin-1 in altered cellular mechanotransduction pathways via
   differential matrix nanotopography and stiffness. Notably, the
   nanopatterning of the stiffer substrata (1.1 GPa) resulted in the
   significant upregulation of RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2. This indicates that
   nanopatterning an 800\_800\_600 nm pattern on a stiff substratum may
   trigger the mechanical plasticity of vSMCs resulting in a
   hypercontractile vSMC phenotype, as observed in diabetes or
   hypertension. Given that matrix stiffness is an independent risk factor
   for cardiovascular disease and that CFL can create different matrix
   nanotopographic patterns with high pattern fidelity, we are poised to
   create a combinatorial library of arterial test beds, whether they are
   healthy, diseased, injured, or aged. Such high-throughput testing
   environments will pave the way for the evolution of the next generation
   of vascular scaffolds that can effectively crosstalk with the scaffold
   microenvironment and result in improved clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{This is the era of digital landscapes; the widespread availability of
   powerful sensing technologies has revolutionized the way it is possible
   to interrogate landscapes in order to understand the processes sculpting
   them. Vastly greater areas have now been acquired at `high resolution':
   currently tens of metres globally to millimetric precision and accuracy
   locally. This permits geomorphic features to be visualized and analysed
   across the scales at which Earth-surface processes operate. Especially
   exciting is the capturing of process dynamics in repeated surveying,
   which will only become more important with low-cost accessible data
   generation through techniques such as Structure from Motion (SfM). But
   the key challenge remains; to interpret high resolution Digital Terrain
   Models (DTMs), particularly by extracting geomorphic features in robust
   and objective ways and then linking the observed features to the
   underlying physical processes. In response to the new data and
   challenges, recent years have seen improved processing of raw data into
   DTMs, development of data fusion techniques, novel quantitative analysis
   of topographic data, and innovative geomorphological mapping. The twelve
   papers collected in this volume sample this progress in interrogating
   Earth-surface processes through the analysis of DTMs. They cover a wide
   range of disciplines and spatio-temporal scales, from landslide prone
   landscapes, to agriculturally modified regions, to mountainous
   landscapes, and coastal zones. They all, however, showcase the
   quantitative exploitation of information contained in high-resolution
   topographic data that we believe will underpin the improvement of our
   understanding of many elements of Earth-surface processes. Most of the
   papers introduced here were first presented in a conference session at
   the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in 2011. Copyright (C)

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{824-831}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{A modeling study was performed to investigate the direct impact of amine
   CO2 scrubbing on the efficiency of a coal-fired power plant. The full
   scope of the capture process was simulated with 8 m PZ (piperazine) to
   estimate the steam, electricity, and cooling water requirements. The
   steam cycle was simulated for applications of the capture technology to
   both retrofit and greenfield (optimized new build) coal-fired power
   plants. The reboiler duty of the stripping column had an optimal molar
   L/G (liquid to gas ratio) of 4.9 in the absorber and the maximum
   reboiler temperature of 150 degrees C. Integration of this CO2 capture
   with a greenfield coal plant yielded an identical optimal L/G, but the
   optimal reboiler temperature was 140 degrees C, and the decrease in
   power plant efficiency was 73\%. The retrofit case resulted in an
   optimum case with an L/G of 5.9, a reboiler temperature of 120 degrees
   C, and a decrease in plant efficiency of 7.0\%. When running at the
   optimal L/G, the optimization sensitivity to the reboiler temperature
   was low. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the use of metasurfaces and plasmonic metamaterials to
   minimize the scattering from receiving antennas and sensors, with the
   goal of maximizing their absorption efficiency. We first analytically
   study and highlight the potential of these approaches to realize
   optimized sensors with the desired level of efficiency, being able to
   minimize the electrical presence of a receiving antenna for a chosen
   level of overall absorption. Realistic cloak designs, investigated using
   full-wave simulations, verify the behavior analytically predicted by Mie
   theory. These optimized cloaks offer a practical way to flexibly tailor
   the scattering of receiving antennas, with great benefits in the design
   and optimization of near-field sensors, remote communication systems,
   spoof targets and improved antenna blockage resiliency. Optimized covers
   may also provide other interesting features for the same receiving
   antenna by just tuning its resistive load, such as optimal wireless
   power harvesting or high-to-low tunable absorption efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{SRAM cell design is driven by the need to satisfy several stability and
   performance criteria for all cells in the array in an energy-efficient
   manner. Significant randomness of FET threshold voltages makes achieving
   this difficult and limits both the minimum cell size and minimum array
   supply voltage. Post-silicon adaptivity in the form of an
   adaptive-voltage scheme in a partitioned SRAM array can be used to
   reduce impact of variability despite lack of any spatial correlation in
   realizations. This paper develops a novel optimization flow for
   yield-aware cell sizing and voltage selection under variability given
   the availability of post-silicon voltage tuning. We formulate a
   two-stage stochastic optimization problem in which the first-stage
   decision is to select cell size and possible voltage levels, and the
   second-stage decision is to assign each partition to an optimal voltage
   after manufacturing. We develop closed-form statistical models of array
   margin behavior and yield as a function of V-dd, cell size, and array
   size. We solve the problem using dynamic programming that minimizes
   power while meeting yield constraints on read, write, and static noise
   margins. The proposed flow allows designs that are on average 8\% and up
   to 17\% more power-efficient than the designs in which voltages are
   selected uniformly. The results also indicate that at high-yield levels
   power savings can be up to 32\% in the active mode and 71\% in the
   standby mode.}},

Title = {{Spatial and Temporal Impacts on Water Consumption in Texas from Shale
   Gas Development and Use}},
Journal = {{ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2028-2035}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite the water intensity of hydraulic fracturing, recent life cycle
   analyses have concluded that increased shale gas development will lead
   to net decreases in water consumption if the increased natural gas
   production is used at natural gas combined cycle power plants, shifting
   electricity generation away from coal-fired steam cycle power plants.
   This work expands on these studies by estimating the spatial and
   temporal patterns of changes in consumptive water use in Texas river
   basins during a period of rapid shale gas development and use in
   electricity generation from August 2008 through December 2009. While
   water consumption decreased in Texas overall, some river basins saw
   increased water consumption and others saw decreased water consumption,
   depending on the extent of extraction activity in the basin, the mix of
   power plants using cooling water in that basin, and price-based changes
   in the power sector. Due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity in
   the consumptive water impacts of natural gas development and use in the
   power sector, local and regional water use impacts must also be
   considered in addition to the overall supply chain impacts.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates and compares the performances of several variants
   of the popular ensemble Kalman filter for the assimilation of storm
   surge data with the advanced circulation (ADCIRC) model. Using
   meteorological data from Hurricane Ike to force the ADCIRC model on a
   domain including the Gulf of Mexico coastline, the authors implement and
   compare the standard stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and three
   deterministic square root EnKFs: the singular evolutive interpolated
   Kalman (SEIK) filter, the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF), and
   the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). Covariance inflation and
   localization are implemented in all of these filters. The results from
   twin experiments suggest that the square root ensemble filters could
   lead to very comparable performances with appropriate tuning of
   inflation and localization, suggesting that practical implementation
   details are at least as important as the choice of the square root
   ensemble filter itself. These filters also perform reasonably well with
   a relatively small ensemble size, whereas the stochastic EnKF requires
   larger ensemble sizes to provide similar accuracy for forecasts of storm
   surge.}},

Abstract = {{Photonic integration on thin flexible plastic substrates is important
   for emerging applications ranging from the realization of flexible
   interconnects to conformal sensors applied to the skin. Such devices are
   traditionally fabricated using pattern transfer, which is complicated
   and has limited integration capacity. Here, we report a convenient
   monolithic approach to realize flexible, integrated high-index-contrast
   chalcogenide glass photonic devices. By developing local neutral axis
   designs and suitable fabrication techniques, we realize a suite of
   photonic devices including waveguides, microdisk resonators, add-drop
   filters and photonic crystals that have excellent optical performance
   and mechanical flexibility, enabling repeated bending down to
   sub-millimetre radii without measurable performance degradation. The
   approach offers a facile fabrication route for three-dimensional
   high-index-contrast photonics that are difficult to create using
   traditional methods.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Wind- and current-driven flotsam, oil spills, pollutants, and nutrients,
   approaching the nearshore will frequently appear to slow down/park just
   beyond the break zone, where waves break. Moreover, the portion of these
   tracers that beach will do so only after a longtime. Explaining why
   these tracers park and at what rate they reach the shore has important
   implications on a variety of different nearshore environmental issues,
   including the determination of what subscale processes are essential in
   computer models for the simulation of pollutant transport in the
   nearshore. Using a simple model we provide an explanation for the
   underlying mechanism responsible for the parking of tracers, not subject
   to inertial effects, the role played by the bottom topography, and the
   non-uniform dispersion which leads, in some circumstances, to the
   eventual landing of all or a portion of the tracers. We refer to the
   parking phenomenon in this environment as nearshore sticky waters. (C)

   Rotor in Hover}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1604-1615}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the refined modeling of the large torsional
   deformation of extremely flexible rotor blades with negligible
   structural stiffness. Equations of motion including flap bending and
   torsion, specifically tailored toward unconventional blades with a tip
   mass and experiencing large elastic twist angles, are derived using the
   extended Hamilton's principle. In particular, the foreshortening of the
   twisted blade arising from the trapeze effect (also called bifilar
   effect) is explicitly included. Quasi-steady aerodynamic forces are
   calculated using the blade element momentum theory. The nonlinear
   coupled equations of motion are solved using a finite-element method.
   The analysis is used to predict the thrust as well as the spanwise
   distribution of flap bending and twist of an 18-in.-diam rotor with
   extremely flexible blades rotating at 1200 rpm at various collective
   pitch angles. These predictions are correlated with the measurement of
   loads obtained using a load cell, and the measurement of the deformation
   obtained using a noncontact optical technique called digital image
   correlation. It is found experimentally and analytically that tip twist
   angles in the range of 10 to 40 deg, depending on the blade design, are
   attained. This torsional deformation is dictated by the combined action
   of the propeller moment and the trapeze effect. A detailed explanation
   of the contribution of the trapeze effect to the equations of motion is
   presented, and it is shown that omitting the axial foreshortening due to
   the trapeze effect leads to a 50\% error in the computation of blade-tip
   twist.}},

Abstract = {{Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) are FDA-approved devices used to bridge
   gaps across severed nerve cables and help direct axons sprouting from
   the proximal end toward the distal stump. In this article, we present
   the development of a novel electrically conductive, biodegradable NGC
   made from a polypyrrole-block-polycaprolactone (PPy-PCL) copolymer
   material laminated with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). The
   PPy-PCL has a bulk conductivity ranging 10-20 S/cm and loses 40 wt \%
   after 7 months under physiologic conditions. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG)
   grown on flat PPy-PCL/PLGA material exposed to direct current electric
   fields (EF) of 100 mV/cm for 2 h increased axon growth by 13\% (+/- 2\%)
   toward either electrode of a 2-electrode setup, compared with control
   grown on identical substrates without EF exposure. Alternating current
   increased axon growth by 21\% (+/- 3\%) without an observable
   directional preference, compared with the same control group. The
   results from this study demonstrate PLGA-coated PPy-PCL is a unique
   biodegradable material that can deliver substrate EF stimulation to
   improve axon growth for peripheral nerve repair. (C) 2013 Wiley

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The orbitally ordered YTiO3 ferromagnet is revisited to investigate the
   influence of local lattice dynamics on the magnetic transition. By
   probing the local lattice dynamics using inelastic neutron scattering
   and the dynamic pair density function (DPDF) analysis, we find that
   strong, local anharmonic fluctuations persist up to 60 meV. The spread
   in energy is expected of fluctuations that are well-defined in
   real-space. The anharmonicity is manifested in the form of a double-well
   potential, where the spectral weight of the DPDF peak involving Y-O
   correlations shifts away from the central peak to two new peaks as a
   function of energy. This transition occurs around 40meV. The weight
   distribution between the two peaks is temperature dependent that
   corresponds to a change in the nature of the local modes. The
   anharmonicity in the Y-O local modes most likely affects the Ti orbital
   overlap leading to a temperature dependent spin disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Replication is a standard technique for fault tolerance in distributed
   systems modeled as deterministic finite state machines (DFSMs or
   machines). To correct crash or Byzantine faults among different
   machines, replication requires backup machines. We present a solution
   called fusion that requires just backup machines. First, we build a
   framework for fault tolerance in DFSMs based on the notion of Hamming
   distances. We introduce the concept of an (, )-fusion, which is a set of
   backup machines that can correct crash faults or Byzantine faults among
   a given set of machines. Second, we present an algorithm to generate an
   (, )-fusion for a given set of machines. We ensure that our backups are
   efficient in terms of the size of their state and event sets. Third, we
   use locality sensitive hashing for the detection and correction of
   faults that incurs almost the same overhead as that for replication. We
   detect Byzantine faults with time complexity on average while we correct
   crash and Byzantine faults with time complexity with high probability,
   where is the average state reduction achieved by fusion. Finally, our
   evaluation of fusion on the widely used MCNC'91 benchmarks for DFSMs
   shows that the average state space savings in fusion (over replication)
   is 38 \% (range 0-99 \%). To demonstrate the practical use of fusion, we
   describe its potential application to two areas: sensor networks and the
   MapReduce framework. In the case of sensor networks a fusion-based
   solution can lead to significantly fewer sensor-nodes than a
   replication-based solution. For the MapReduce framework, fusion can
   reduce the number of map-tasks compared to replication. Hence, fusion
   results in considerable savings in state space and other resources such
   as the power needed to run the backups.}},

Abstract = {{Particles in retail environments can have consequences for the
   occupational exposures of retail workers and customers, as well as the
   energy costs associated with ventilation and filtration. Little is known
   about particle characteristics in retail environments. We measured
   indoor and outdoor mass concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5, number
   concentrations of submicron particles (0.02-1 mu m), size-resolved
   0.3-10 mu m particles, as well as ventilation rates in 14 retail stores
   during 24 site visits in Pennsylvania and Texas. Overall, the results
   were generally suggestive of relatively clean environments when compared
   to investigations of other building types and ambient/occupational
   regulatory limits. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations (mean +/- s.d.) were 20
   +/- 14 and 11 +/- 10 mu g/m(3), respectively, with indoor-to-outdoor
   ratios of 1.0 +/- 0.7 and 0.88 +/- 1.0. Mean submicron particle
   concentrations were 7220 +/- 7500 particles/cm(3) with an
   indoor-to-outdoor ratio of 1.18 +/- 1.30. The median contribution to
   PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations from indoor sources (vs. outdoors) was
   83\% and 53\%, respectively. There were no significant correlations
   between measured ventilation rates and particle concentrations of any
   size. When examining options to lower PM2.5 concentrations below
   regulatory limits, the required changes to ventilation and filtration
   efficiency were site specific and depended on the indoor and outdoor
   concentration, emission rate, and infiltration level.}},

Journal = {{BIOMECHANICS AND MODELING IN MECHANOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{813-826}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{While the mechanical behaviors of the fibrosa and ventricularis layers
   of the aortic valve (AV) leaflet are understood, little information
   exists on their mechanical interactions mediated by the GAG-rich central
   spongiosa layer. Parametric simulations of the interlayer interactions
   of the AV leaflets in flexure utilized a tri-layered finite element (FE)
   model of circumferentially oriented tissue sections to investigate
   inter-layer sliding hypothesized to occur. Simulation results indicated
   that the leaflet tissue functions as a tightly bonded structure when the
   spongiosa effective modulus was at least 25 \% that of the fibrosa and
   ventricularis layers. Novel studies that directly measured transmural
   strain in flexure of AV leaflet tissue specimens validated these
   findings. Interestingly, a smooth transmural strain distribution
   indicated that the layers of the leaflet indeed act as a bonded unit,
   consistent with our previous observations (Stella and Sacks in J Biomech
   Eng 129:757-766, 2007) of a large number of transverse collagen fibers
   interconnecting the fibrosa and ventricularis layers. Additionally, when
   the tri-layered FE model was refined to match the transmural
   deformations, a layer-specific bimodular material model (resulting in
   four total moduli) accurately matched the transmural strain and
   moment-curvature relations simultaneously. Collectively, these results
   provide evidence, contrary to previous assumptions, that the valve
   layers function as a bonded structure in the low-strain flexure
   deformation mode. Most likely, this results directly from the transverse
   collagen fibers that bind the layers together to disable physical
   sliding and maintain layer residual stresses. Further, the spongiosa may
   function as a general dampening layer while the AV leaflets deforms as a
   homogenous structure despite its heterogeneous architecture.}},

Abstract = {{As an alternative effort for quantifying recurrent traffic dynamics
   caused by network variations and analyzing the impact on the network
   performance from information provision, we describe in this paper a new
   equilibrium modeling scheme for stochastic networks with a finite number
   of states, which takes into account the behavioral inertia. A
   finite-dimensional variational inequality model is formulated to
   describe the cross-state equilibrium conditions among heterogeneous
   travelers with different inertial degrees and knowledge structures. Our
   model allows for traveler's partial understanding and inertial effect in
   perceiving varying network conditions and provides a different
   perspective (from existing stochastic and Markovian network equilibrium
   approaches) to describe traffic flow variations across multiple network
   scenarios. A disaggregate simplicial decomposition algorithm is
   suggested to solve the variational inequality problem. Numerical results
   from a few stochastic network examples demonstrate the validity and
   effectiveness of our methodology in modeling the inertia phenomenon
   within route choice behavior and the efficacy of using traveler
   information systems to eliminate the inertia effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper reports the design of a vascular structure for an artificial
   tree, also known as an evaporation-driven porous substrate bioreactor
   (PSBR), for efficient biofuel production using microalgae. This system
   consists of multiple vertical ribs, each of which is made of porous
   membrane and grows algal cells on its surface as a biofilm. Nutrient
   medium flow through the reactor is driven by evaporation at the terminal
   end of the porous membrane, and nutrients are delivered from the porous
   membrane to the cells by diffusion. Flow through the membrane was
   modeled as a function of the physico-chemical and morphological
   properties of the membrane, as well as the environmental parameters
   governing evaporation. It was determined that under typical operating
   conditions, the evaporative flux from the evaporator region ranged from
   about 14 to 66 mg/m s. Moreover, there was a membrane pore radius that
   maximized nutrient medium flow as a result of the competition between
   capillary, viscous, and gravitational forces. For the range of
   evaporative fluxes observed in this study, this pore radius was about 10
   m. Furthermore, a design example is provided for artificial trees made
   of three different commercially available membrane materials. A design
   methodology was demonstrated for maximizing photosynthetic productivity
   by tuning the evaporation-driven flow rate to ensure sufficient nutrient
   delivery to cells without incurring large evaporative loss rates. It was
   observed that both the growth rate and the evaporation-driven nutrient
   delivery rate were directly related to the irradiance in outdoor
   artificial trees, which provides a passive and efficient nutrient
   delivery mechanism. It is expected that the design principles along with
   the physical models governing the fluid flow in these vascular
   structures will aid researchers in developing novel applications for
   artificial trees.}},

Abstract = {{Petrophysical interpretation of well logs acquired in organic shales and
   carbonates is challenging because of the presence of thin beds and
   spatially complex lithology; conventional interpretation techniques
   often fail in such cases. Recently introduced methods for thin-bed
   interpretation enable corrections for shoulder-bed effects on well logs
   but remain sensitive to incorrectly picked bed boundaries. We introduce
   a new inversion-based method to detect bed boundaries and to estimate
   petrophysical and compositional properties of multilayer formations from
   conventional well logs in the presence of thin beds, complex
   lithology/fluids, and kerogen. Bed boundaries and bed properties are
   updated in two serial inversion loops. Numerical simulation of well logs
   within both inversion loops explicitly takes into account differences in
   the volume of investigation of all well logs involved in the estimation,
   thereby enabling corrections for shoulder-bed effects. The successful
   application of the new interpretation method is documented with
   synthetic cases and field data acquired in thinly bedded carbonates and
   in the Haynesville shale-gas formation. Estimates of
   petrophysical/compositional properties obtained with the new
   interpretation method were compared to those obtained with (1) nonlinear
   inversion of well logs with inaccurate bed boundaries, (2)
   depth-by-depth inversion of well logs, and (3) core/x-ray diffraction
   measurements. Results indicated that the new method improves the
   estimation of porosity of thin beds by more than 200\% in the carbonate
   field example and by more than 40\% in the shale-gas example, compared
   to depth-by-depth interpretation results obtained with commercial
   software. This improvement in the assessment of
   petrophysical/compositional properties reduces uncertainty in
   hydrocarbon reserves and aids in the selection of hydraulic fracture
   locations in organic shale.}},

Abstract = {{Slender marine risers used in deepwater applications can experience
   vortex-induced vibration (VIV). It is becoming increasingly common for
   field monitoring campaigns to be undertaken wherein data loggers such as
   strain sensors and/or accelerometers are installed on such risers to aid
   in VIV-related fatigue damage estimation. Such damage estimation relies
   on the application of empirical procedures that make use of the
   collected data. This type of damage estimation can be undertaken for
   different current profiles encountered. The empirical techniques
   employed make direct use of the measurements and key components in the
   analyszes (such as participating riser modes selected for use in damage
   estimation) are intrinsically dependent on the actual current profiles.
   Fatigue damage predicted in this manner is in contrast to analytical
   approaches that rely on simplifying assumptions on both the flow
   conditions and the response characteristics. Empirical fatigue damage
   estimates conditional on current profile type can account explicitly
   even for complex response characteristics, participating riser modes,
   etc. With significant amounts of data, it is possible to establish
   ``short-term{''} fatigue damage rate distributions conditional on
   current type. If the relative frequency of different current types is
   known from metocean studies, the short-term fatigue distributions can be
   combined with the current distributions to yield integrated
   ``long-term{''} fatigue damage rate distributions. Such a study is
   carried out using data from the Norwegian Deepwater Programme (NDP)
   model riser subject to several sheared and uniform current profiles and
   with assumed probabilities for different current conditions. From this
   study, we seek to demonstrate the effectiveness of empirical techniques
   utilized in combination with field measurements to predict the long-term
   fatigue damage and the fatigue failure probability.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{A well-established empirical procedure, which we refer to as weighted
   waveform analysis (WWA), is employed to reconstruct a model riser's
   response over its entire length using a limited number of strain
   measurements. The quality of the response reconstruction is controlled
   largely by identification of the participating riser response modes
   (waveforms); hence, mode selection is vital in WWA application. Instead
   of selecting a set of consecutive riser vibratory modes, we propose a
   procedure that automatically identifies a set of nonconsecutive riser
   modes that can thus account for higher harmonics in the riser response
   (at multiplies of the Strouhal frequency). Using temporal data analysis
   of the discrete time-stamped samples, significant response frequencies
   are identified on the basis of power spectrum peaks; similarly, using
   the spatial data analysis of the sparse nonuniformly sampled data,
   significant wavenumbers are identified using Lomb-Scargle periodograms.
   Knowing the riser length, the most important wavenumber is related to a
   specific mode number; this dominant mode is, in turn, related to the
   dominant peak in power spectra based on the temporal data analysis. The
   riser's fundamental frequency is estimated as the ratio of the
   empirically estimated dominant spectral frequency to the dominant mode
   number. Additional mode numbers are also identified as spectral peak
   frequencies divided by the fundamental frequency. This mode selection
   technique is an improvement over similar WWA procedures that rely on a
   priori knowledge of the riser's fundamental frequency or on the
   knowledge of the physical properties and assumptions on added mass
   contributions. At selected target locations, we compare fatigue damage
   rates, estimated based on the riser response reconstructed using the WWA
   method with the proposed automated mode selection technique (we refer to
   this as the ``improved{''} WWA) and those based on the ``original{''}
   WWA method (that relies on a theoretically computed fundamental natural
   frequency of the riser). In both cases, predicted fatigue damage rates
   based on the empirical methods and data at various locations (other than
   the target) are cross-validated against damage rates based directly on
   measurements at the target location. The results show that the improved
   WWA method, which empirically estimates the riser's fundamental natural
   frequency and automatically selects significant modes of vibration, may
   be employed to estimate fatigue damage rates quite well from limited
   strain measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of organic-rich mudrock
   (shale) samples show a wide distribution of pore sizes (commonly between
   1 nm and 1 mu m) and complex pore spatial configurations (Loucks et al.,
   2012). Pore size and pore connectivity are important parameters in that
   they have first order impact on macroscopic flow properties of a porous
   medium. However, given the significant difficulty in capturing
   multiscale pores within a single three-dimensional image, and the
   possible uncertainties in the existence or absence of original throats
   in an acquired image, it is imperative to explore indirect methods to
   quantify the pore structure. In this paper, we simulate sorption in
   heterogeneous pore network models and study sorption and permeability
   hysteresis analyses as indirect methods for rock characterization.
   Three network types are introduced to represent the multiscale pore
   topology of shale rocks; specifically: regular (type 1), series (type 2)
   and parallel (type 3). We conclude that, in appropriate size ranges,
   sorption hysteresis can distinguish the three types whereas permeability
   hysteresis can only separate parallel from series and regular.
   Furthermore, the simulations show that sorption hysteresis is sensitive
   to compaction/cementation (closing of throats) in all network types
   whereas permeability hysteresis is sensitive to the diagenesis in
   parallel networks only. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A state space method is proposed for analyzing surface instability of
   elastic layers with elastic properties varying in the thickness
   direction. By assuming linear elasticity with nonlinear kinematics, the
   governing equations for the incremental stress field from a fundamental
   state are derived for arbitrarily graded elastic layers subject to
   plane-strain compression, which lead to an eigenvalue problem. By
   discretizing the elastic properties into piecewise constant functions
   with homogeneous sublayers, a state space method is developed to solve
   the eigenvalue problem and predict the critical condition for onset of
   surface instability. Results are presented for homogeneous layers,
   bilayers, and continuously graded elastic layers. The state space
   solutions for elastic bilayers are in close agreement with the
   analytical solution for thin film wrinkling within the limit of linear
   elasticity. Numerical solutions for continuously graded elastic layers
   are compared to finite element results in a previous study (Lee et al.,
   2008, J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 56, pp. 858-868). As a semi-analytical
   approach, the state space method is computationally efficient for graded
   elastic layers, especially for laminated multilayers.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Interactions in linear elastic solids containing inhomogeneities are
   examined using integral equations. Direct and reflected interactions are
   identified. Direct interactions occur simply because elastic fields
   emitted by inhomogeneities affect each other. Reflected interactions
   occur because elastic fields emitted by inhomogeneities are reflected by
   the specimen boundary back to the individual inhomogeneities. It is
   shown that the reflected interactions are of critical importance to
   analysis of representative volume elements. Further, the reflected
   interactions are expressed in simple terms, so that one can obtain
   explicit approximate expressions for the effective stiffness tensor for
   linear elastic solids containing ellipsoidal and non-ellipsoidal
   inhomogeneities. For ellipsoidal inhomogeneities, the new approximation
   is closely related to that of Mori and Tanaka. In general, the new
   approximation can be used to recover Ponte Castaneda-Willis' and
   Kanaun-Levin's approximations. Connections with Maxwell's approximation

Title = {{An empirically-validated methodology to simulate electricity demand for
   electric vehicle charging}},

Abstract = {{With recent changes in the availability and diversity of plug-in
   electric vehicles (PEVs) in the United States, there is increasing
   research interest in the interaction between PEVs and the electric grid.
   Extensive work in the literature examines these interactions with the
   assumption that the timing of PEV charging will be scheduled, and that
   charging loads can be adjusted dynamically at the behest of the utility
   and the system operator. While it might be technically feasible to
   aggregate the data on driver schedules and historical PEV use and
   charging decisions, it is unclear whether PEV owners will readily share
   these data and accept partial third-party control of their vehicle's
   charging. Given the uncertainty in the future relationships between
   electric utilities and PEV owners, this study examines the region-level
   effects of PEV charging in the absence of the additional data utilities
   would need to realize these idealized charging scenarios. In particular,
   this study focuses on temporally-resolved prediction of electricity
   demand needed to serve PEV charging loads if charge scheduling or
   control is not widespread.
   Vehicle trip data from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) were
   converted into individual vehicle charging profiles. Monte Carlo methods
   were then used with these profiles to simulate electricity demand for
   PEV charging. These simulations include accounting for the potential
   demographic characteristics of PEV drivers and the estimated charging
   behavior of those drivers. The simulation results were validated using
   empirical vehicle charging data collected by the Pecan Street Research
   Consortium from households in Austin, Texas. The simulation results
   compared favorably with the empirical data, estimating charging behavior
   to within 7\% throughout most of the day. Two different simulation
   approaches were considered to show that a reduced-order simulation
   approach yields similar results. Finally, having demonstrated the
   stability of the simulation to assumptions about PEV owner demographics
   and PEV type-dependent charging patterns, the simulation results were
   used to determine the effect of unscheduled PEV charging on peak load in
   three different regions, Texas, New York, and New England, with three
   PEV fleet growth projections. These results indicate that for the
   moderate growth scenario considered, unscheduled charging will increase
   peak load by less than 1\% by 2025 in each of the three regions. (C)

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{710-717}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This work explores capillary flow through micropillar arrays with
   rectangular pillar arrangements. The effects of these configurations on
   permeability and capillary pressure are investigated for heat pipe wick
   applications. The permeability is described in terms of three
   dimensionless parameters: h/d, l/d, and S/d, where l and S are the
   edge-to-edge spacings in the x- and y-directions, respectively. The two
   analytical permeability models considered are Hale et al. (2014) {[}20]
   and the Brinkman equation using specifically the permeability derived by
   Tamayol and Bahrami (2009) {[}19]. Permeability results from numerical
   simulations are also presented. The surface energy minimization program
   called Surface Evolver is used to calculate the capillary pressure
   within the arrays. Mass flow rates are first derived from a combination
   of array permeability and capillary pressure, and then used to predict
   the capillary limit of heat pipes equipped with these wicks. Rectangular
   arrays exhibited the ability to maintain high capillary pressures even
   at high porosities, which increased the overall cooling capacity above
   square arrays. The increase was on the order of 1.5x in the absence of
   gravity and 5x-7x in the presence of gravity, depending on the exact hid
   ratio considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the computational design, fabrication and validation of a
   multi-layer silicon based thin film solar cell. The cell structure
   consists of a thin absorber layer of amorphous silicon deposited on a
   back-reflector aluminum layer and coated on top with ITO transparent
   conductive oxide. The structure is mounted on a glass substrate. We
   first use constrained optimization techniques along with numerical
   solvers of the electromagnetic equations (i.e. FDTD) to tune the
   geometry of the design. The resulting structure suggests that photon
   absorptivity in the thin film silicon can be enhanced by as much as
   100\% over the uncoated layer. The proposed design is then fabricated
   using thin film deposition techniques, along with a control sample of
   bare silicon absorber for comparison. AFM imaging and spectrophotometry
   experiments are applied to image and record the surface roughness and
   measure the reflectivity spectrum of the sample. Using the measured
   reflectivity spectrum, we then use inverse optimization to estimate the
   realized thin film dimensions, deposition error and unwanted oxidation
   volume. At the end, we use a statistical Monte Carlo analysis as a
   second method of verification to demonstrate that the measured spectra
   are in accordance with the expected curves from simulation, and to
   estimate the effects of fabrication error. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the physical parameters of articulated multibody systems
   (AMBSs) using an uncalibrated monocular camera poses significant
   challenges for vision-based robotics. Articulated multibody models,
   especially ones including dynamics, have shown good performance for pose
   tracking, but require good estimates of system parameters. In this
   paper, we first propose a technique for estimating parameters of a
   dynamically equivalent model (kinematic/geometric lengths as well as
   mass, inertia, damping coefficients) given only the underlying
   articulated model topology. The estimated dynamically equivalent model
   is then employed to help predict/filter/gap-fill the raw pose estimates,
   using an unscented Kalman filter. The framework is tested initially on
   videos of a relatively simple AMBS (double pendulum in a structured
   laboratory environment). The double pendulum not only served as a
   surrogate model for the human lower limb in flight phase, but also
   helped evaluate the role of model fidelity. The treatment is then
   extended to realize physically plausible pose-estimates of human
   lower-limbmotions, inmore-complex uncalibrated monocular videos (from
   the publicly available DARPA Mind's Eye Year 1 corpus). Beyond the
   immediate problem-at-hand, the presented work has applications in
   creation of low-order surrogate computational dynamics models for
   analysis, control, and tracking of many other articulated multibody
   robotic systems (e. g., manipulators, humanoids) using vision.}},

Abstract = {{Pure gas permeability coefficients of CH4, N-2, O-2, CO2, and H-2 are
   reported for thermally rearranged (TR) polymers derived from polyimides
   based on 3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-biphenyl and
   2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (HAB-6FDA).
   These HAB-6FDA polymers were prepared with hydroxyl, acetate,
   propanoate, and pivalate groups in the ortho-position to the imide ring.
   Polymers with acetate ortho-position groups were synthesized via either
   thermal or chemical imidization. Pure gas permeability was approximately
   five Limes higher after rearrangement at 450 degrees C in TR polymers
   from polyimides with acetate, propanoate, and pivalate ortho-position
   groups relative to TR polymers prepared from polyimides with hydroxyl
   of-am-position groups, in samples with non hydroxyl ortho-position
   groups, those with larger ortho-position groups had higher gas
   permeability for TR conversions less than roughly 60\%, but permeability
   increased to similar values as conversion exceeded 60\%. In all samples,
   the CO2/CH4 selectivity also approached a similar value as TR conversion
   increased. Despite their higher permeability, fractional free volume was
   not significantly higher in TR polymers from polyimides bearing
   non-hydroxyl ortho-position groups than in samples with hydroxyl
   ortho-position groups. Therefore, average free volume alone cannot
   explain this behavior, suggesting that free volume distribution is
   likely affected by these groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Pore-scale simulation of fluid flow and solute dispersion in
   three-dimensional porous media}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{In the present work fluid flow and solute transport through porous media
   are described by solving the governing equations at the pore scale with
   finite-volume discretization. Instead of solving the simplified Stokes
   equation (very often employed in this context) the full Navier-Stokes
   equation is used here. The realistic three-dimensional porous medium is
   created in this work by packing together, with standard ballistic
   physics, irregular and polydisperse objects. Emphasis is placed on
   numerical issues related to mesh generation and spatial discretization,
   which play an important role in determining the final accuracy of the
   finite-volume scheme and are often overlooked. The simulations performed
   are then analyzed in terms of velocity distributions and dispersion
   rates in a wider range of operating conditions, when compared with other
   works carried out by solving the Stokes equation. Results show that
   dispersion within the analyzed porous medium is adequately described by
   classical power laws obtained by analytic homogenization. Eventually the
   validity of Fickian diffusion to treat dispersion in porous media is
   also assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Immiscible displacement of viscous oil by water in a petroleum reservoir
   is often hydrodynamically unstable. Due to similarities between the
   physics of dielectric breakdown and immiscible flow in porous media, we
   extend the existing dielectric breakdown model to simulate viscous
   fingering patterns for a wide range of viscosity ratios (mu(r)). At low
   values of power-law index eta, the system behaves like a stable Eden
   growth model and as the value of. is increased to unity, diffusion
   limited aggregation-like fractals appear. This model is compared with
   our two-dimensional (2D) experiments to develop a correlation between
   the viscosity ratio and the power index, i.e., eta = 10(-5)
   mu(0.8775)(r). The 2D and three-dimensional (3D) simulation data appear
   scalable. The fingering pattern in 3D simulations at finite viscosity
   ratios appear qualitatively similar to the few experimental results
   published in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The physical mechanisms of unipolar resistive switching (RS) in
   SiOx-based resistive memory are investigated using TaN/SiOx/n(++)Si and
   TiW/SiOx/TiW device structures. RS is independent of SiOx thickness and
   device area, confirming that RS occurs in a localized region along a
   filamentary pathway. Results from experiments varying electrode type,
   series resistance, and the oxygen content of SiOxNy materials show the
   potential to optimize switching performance and control device
   programming window. Device materials with stoichiometry near that of
   SiO2 are found to have better operating stability as compared to
   extrinsic, N-doped SiOxNy materials. The results provide further insight
   into the physical mechanisms of unipolar operation and lead to a
   localized switching model based on electrochemical transitions involving
   common SiOx defects. High-temperature data retention measurements for
   over 10(4) s in high-and low-resistance states demonstrate the potential
   for use of intrinsic SiOx RS devices in future nonvolatile memory

Abstract = {{Multilevel programing and charge transport characteristics of intrinsic
   SiOx-based resistive switching memory are investigated using
   TaN/SiOx/n(++)Si (MIS) and TiW/SiOx/TiW (MIM) device structures. Current
   transport characteristics of high-and low-resistance states (HRS and
   LRS) are studied in both device structures during multilevel operation.
   Analysis of device thermal response demonstrates that the effective
   electron energy barrier is strongly dependent on the resistance of the
   programed state, with estimates of 0.1 eV in the LRS and 0.6 eV in the
   HRS. Linear data fitting and conductance analyses indicate Poole-Frenkel
   emission or hopping conductance in the low-voltage region, whereas
   Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) or trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) is indicated at
   moderate voltage. Characterizations using hopping transport lead to
   hopping distance estimates of similar to 1 nm in the LRS for both device
   structures. Relative permittivity values (epsilon(r)) were extracted
   using the Poole-Frenkel formulism and estimates of local filament
   temperature, where epsilon(r) values were similar to 80 in the LRS and
   similar to 4 in the HRS, suggesting a strongly polarized medium in the
   LRS. The onset of F-N tunneling or TAT corresponds to an observed
   ``overshoot{''} in the I-V response with an estimated threshold of 1.6
   +/- 0.2 V, in good agreement with reported electro-luminescence results
   for LRS devices. Resistive switching is discussed in terms of
   electrochemical reactions between common SiO2 defects, and specific
   defect energy levels are assigned to the dominant transitions in the I-V
   response. The overshoot response in the LRS is consistent with TAT
   through either the E gamma' oxygen vacancy or the hydrogen bridge
   defect, both of which are reported to have an effective bandgap of 1.7
   eV. The SET threshold at similar to 2.5V is modeled as hydrogen release
   from the (Si-H)(2) defect to generate the hydrogen bridge, and the RESET
   transition is modeled as an electrochemical reaction that re-forms
   (SiH)(2). The results provide further insights into charge transport and
   help identify potential switching mechanisms in SiOx-based unipolar
   resistive switching memory. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the electrical characterization and an equivalent
   circuit of a microhollow cathode discharge (MHCD) reactor in the
   self-pulsing regime. A MHCD reactor was prototyped for air plasma
   generation, and its current-voltage characteristics were measured
   experimentally in the self-pulsing regime for applied voltages from 2000
   to 3000 V. The reactor was modeled as a capacitor in parallel with a
   variable resistor. A stray capacitance was also introduced to the
   circuit model to represent the capacitance of the circuit elements in
   the experimental setup. The values of the resistor and capacitors were
   recovered from experimental data, and the proposed circuit model was
   validated with independent experiments. Experimental data showed that
   increasing the applied voltage increased the current, self-pulsing
   frequency and average power consumption of the reactor, while it
   decreased the peak voltage. The maximum and the minimum voltages
   obtained using the model were in agreement with the experimental data
   within 2.5\%, whereas the differences between peak current values were
   less than 1\%. At all applied voltages, the equivalent circuit model was
   able to accurately represent the peak and average power consumption as
   well as the self-pulsing frequency within the experimental uncertainty.
   Although the results shown in this paper was for atmospheric air
   pressures, the proposed equivalent circuit model of the MHCD reactor
   could be generalized for other gases at different pressures. (C) 2014

Title = {{The improved resistance of PDMS to pressure-induced deformation and
   chemical solvent swelling for microfluidic devices}},
Journal = {{MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{We present a fabrication technique that increases the resistance of PDMS
   to deformation under pressure driven flow and chemical solvents swelling
   without the use of any foreign materials. This is achieved by enhancing
   the material properties of PDMS by coupling two previously isolated
   processes. First, the weight ratio of the prepolymer to the curing agent
   was increased from 10:1 to 5:1, with the latter showing 20\% less
   deformation under pressurized conditions. Second, the cured PDMS was
   thermally aged at 200 degrees C for a few hours, resulting in 140\% less
   deformation for the thermally aged chip under the same pressure
   conditions. The combined processes benefit from a nonlinear coupling
   effect on improvement and show 860\% less deformation under pressure
   driven flow in the enhanced PDMS chip compared to that in the standard
   10:1 PDMS chip. The deformation of the standard and the enhanced PDMS
   micro-channels under pressure driven flow is quantified using
   fluorescence microscopy. The compatibility of PDMS with nonpolar
   solvents was also explored by quantifying material swelling due to
   toluene absorption using brightfield imaging of the microchannel. The
   enhanced PDMS showed less than 10\% swelling against toluene compared to
   55\% in the standard PDMS. The enhanced PDMS is also less permeable to
   the small hydrophobic molecule rhodamine B (RhB), as quantified by
   epi-fluorescence microscopy of the absorbed dye. The improved surface
   and material properties of the thermally treated PDMS are certainly
   beneficial in microfluidic applications that use this common soft
   lithography material. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Percolation and Grain Boundary Wetting in Anisotropic Texturally
   Equilibrated Pore Networks}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{In texturally equilibrated porous media the pore geometry evolves to
   minimize the energy of the liquid-solid interfaces, while maintaining
   the dihedral angle theta at solid-solid-liquid contact lines. We present
   computations of three-dimensional texturally equilibrated pore networks
   using a level-set method. Our results show that the grain boundaries
   with the smallest area can be fully wetted by the pore fluid even for
   theta > 0. This was previously not thought to be possible at textural
   equilibrium and reconciles the theory with experimental observations.
   Even small anisotropy in the fabric of the porous medium allows the
   wetting of these faces at very low porosities, phi < 3\%. Percolation
   and orientation of the wetted faces relative to the anisotropy of the
   fabric are controlled by theta. The wetted grain boundaries are
   perpendicular to the direction of stretching for theta > 60 degrees and
   the pores do not percolate for any investigated phi. For theta < 60
   degrees, in contrast, the grain boundaries parallel to the direction of
   stretching are wetted and a percolating pore network forms for all phi
   investigated. At low theta even small anisotropy in the fabric induces
   large anisotropy in the permeability, due to the concentration of liquid
   on the grain boundaries and faces.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{We review the key optoelectronic properties of lateral organic bulk
   heterojunction (BHJ) device structures with asymmetric contacts. These
   structures are used to develop a detailed model of charge transport and
   recombination properties within materials used for organic
   photovoltaics. They permit a variety of direct measurement techniques,
   such as nonlinear optical microscopy and in situ potentiometry, as well
   as photoconductive gain and carrier drift length studies from
   photocurrent measurements. We present a theoretical framework that
   describes the charge transport physics within these devices. The
   experimental results presented are in agreement with this framework and
   can be used to measure carrier concentrations, recombination
   coefficients, and carrier mobilities within BHJ materials. Lateral
   device structures offer a useful complement to measurements on vertical
   photovoltaic structures and provide a more complete and detailed picture
   of organic BHJ materials. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a

Abstract = {{Environmentally benign clay particles are of great interest for the
   stabilization of Pickering emulsions. Dodecane-in-synthetic seawater
   (SSW) emulsions formed with montmorillonite (MMT) clay microparticles
   modified with bis(2-hydroxyethyl)oleylamine were stable against
   coalescence, even at clay concentrations down to 0.1\% w/v. Remarkably,
   as little as 0.001\% w/v surfactant lowered the hydrophilicity of the
   clay to a sufficient level for stabilization of oil-in-SSW emulsions.
   The favorable effect of SSW on droplet size reduction and emulsion
   stability enhancement is hypothesized to be due to reduced electrostatic
   repulsion between adsorbed clay particles and a consequent increase in
   the continuous phase (an aqueous clay suspension) viscosity. Water/oil
   (W/O) emulsions were inverted to O/W either by decreasing the mass ratio
   of surfactant-to-clay (transitional inversion) or by increasing the
   water volume fraction (catastrophic inversion). For both types of
   emulsions, coalescence was minimal and the sedimentation or creaming was
   highly correlated with the droplet size. For catastrophic inversions,
   the droplet size of the emulsions was smaller in the case of the
   preferred curvature. Suspensions of concentrated clay in oil dispersions
   in the presence of surfactant were stable against settling. The mass
   transfer pathways during emulsification of oil containing the clay
   particles were analyzed on the droplet size/stability phase diagrams to
   provide insight for the design of dispersant systems for remediating
   surface and subsurface oceanic oil spills.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations and a stochastic method based on the

   inhomogeneous density profiles on the thermodynamic and dynamic

   Effects of the inhomogeneity length scale are systematically considered
   via the imposition of sinusoidal density profiles of various
   wavelengths. For long-wavelength density profiles, bulk-like
   relationships between local structure, thermodynamics, and diffusivity
   are observed as expected. However, for both systems, a crossover in
   behavior occurs as a function of wavelength, with qualitatively
   different correlations between the local static and dynamic quantities
   emerging as density variations approach the scale of a particle
   diameter. Irrespective of the density variation wavelength, average
   diffusivities of hard-sphere fluids in the inhomogeneous and homogeneous
   directions are coupled and approximately correlate with the volume
   available for insertion of another particle. Unfortunately, a
   quantitatively reliable static predictor of position-dependent dynamics

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{105}},

Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{The parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea has the remarkable ability to locate
   crickets using audible sound. This ability is, in fact, remarkable as
   the fly's hearing mechanism spans only 1.5mm which is 50 x smaller than
   the wavelength of sound emitted by the cricket. The hearing mechanism
   is, for all practical purposes, a point in space with no significant
   interaural time or level differences to draw from. It has been
   discovered that evolution has empowered the fly with a hearing mechanism
   that utilizes multiple vibration modes to amplify interaural time and
   level differences. Here, we present a fully integrated, man-made mimic
   of the Ormia's hearing mechanism capable of replicating the remarkable
   sound localization ability of the special fly. A silicon-micromachined
   prototype is presented which uses multiple piezoelectric sensing ports
   to simultaneously transduce two orthogonal vibration modes of the
   sensing structure, thereby enabling simultaneous measurement of sound
   pressure and pressure gradient. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Geological storage of CO2 (GCS), also referred to as carbon
   sequestration, is a critical component for decreasing anthropogenic CO2
   atmospheric emissions. Stored CO2 will exist as a supercritical phase,
   most likely in deep, saline, sedimentary reservoirs. Research at the
   Center for Frontiers of Subsurface Energy Security (CFSES), a Department
   of Energy, Energy Frontier Research Center, provides insights into the
   storage process. The integration of pore-scale experiments, molecular
   dynamics simulations, and study of natural analogue sites has enabled
   understanding of the efficacy of capillary, solubility, and dissolution
   trapping of CO2 for GCS. Molecular dynamics simulations provide insight
   on relative wetting of supercritical CO2 and brine hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic basal surfaces of kaolinite. Column experiments of
   successive supercritical CO2/brine flooding with high-resolution X-ray
   computed tomography imaging show a greater than 10\% difference of
   residual trapping of CO2 in hydrophobic media compared to hydrophilic
   media that trapped only 2\% of the CO2. Simulation results suggest that
   injecting a slug of nanopartide dispersion into the storage reservoir
   before starting CO2 injection could increase the overall efficiency of
   large-scale storage. We estimate that approximately 22\% +/- 17\% of the
   initial CO2 emplaced into the Bravo Dome field site of New Mexico has
   dissolved into the underlying brine. The rate of CO2 dissolution may be
   considered limited over geological timescales. Field observations at the
   Little Grand Wash fault in Utah suggest that calcite precipitation
   results in shifts in preferential flow paths of the upward migrating
   CO2-saturated-brine. Results of hybrid pore-scale and pore network
   modeling based on Little Grand Wash fault observations demonstrate that
   inclusion of realistic pore configurations, flow and transport physics,
   and geochemistry are needed to enhance our fundamental mechanistic
   explanations of how calcite precipitation alters flow paths by pore
   plugging to match the Little Grand Wash fault observations.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled attachment of molecules to the surface of a material can
   alter the band structure energies with respect to the surrounding
   environment via a combination of intrinsic and bonding-induced dipoles.
   Here, we demonstrate that the surface potential of an
   application-relevant material, anatase TiO2, can be tuned over a broad
   energy range of similar to 1 eV using a family of dipolar phosphonic
   acid-based adsorbates. Using TiO2 as an example, we show with
   photoelectron spectroscopy that these adsorbates are stable in a liquid
   environment (propylene carbonate). More interestingly, the tunability is
   substantially retained and follows trends in the computed bound dipole.
   The electrochemical surface potential is shown to vary over 600 meV, the
   highest range in electrolytes to the best of our knowledge. Using
   density functional theory calculations, we rationalize the measured
   trends and show that the effective dipole upon molecular adsorption and
   not the intrinsic dipole of the isolated molecules correlates with
   observed changes in surface potential. Control of the effective dipole,
   through judicious choice of robust surface species, can allow in situ
   tuning of energy levels and functionality at active surfaces for energy
   conversion and storage, biosensing, and molecular electronics.}},

Volume = {{345}},
Pages = {{128-135}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to investigate the sensitivity of
   electrodialysis performance to variations in voltage application and
   membranes when treating brackish water reverse osmosis concentrate
   waste. Synthetic BWRO concentrates from Arizona and Texas of 7890-14,800
   mg/L total dissolved solids were prepared with poly-phosphonate
   antiscalants. Experimentation was performed using a laboratory-scale
   electrodialyzer with two sets of membranes (AMV-CMV and PCSA-PCSK) with
   a nominal transfer area of 64 cm(2) per membrane. Flow, pressure,
   conductivity, temperature, and pH were measured continuously, and
   periodic samples were analyzed for specific anion and cation
   concentrations. The BWRO concentrates were successfully treated with
   stack voltage applications of 0.5-1.5 V/cell-pair for salinity removal
   ratios up to 99\% with current density less than 500 A/m(2). This paper
   highlights that (1) the specific energy consumption was proportional to
   the applied voltage and equivalent concentration separated (i.e.,
   approximately 0.03 kW h/m(3) per Volt/cell-pair applied per meq/L
   separated); (2) lower voltage applications decreased the relative
   separation rate of sulfate compared to chloride; and (3) water transport
   by electro-osmosis was independent of voltage application or resulting
   current densities, while it is affected by the ion exchange membranes.

Journal = {{CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{90-109}},

Abstract = {{Soft sensors (or inferential sensors) have been demonstrated to be an
   effective solution for monitoring quality performance and control
   applications in the chemical industry. One of the key issues during the
   development of soft sensor models is the selection of relevant variables
   from a large array of measurements. A subset of variables that are
   selected based on first principles and statistical correlations eases
   the model development process. The resulting model will perform better
   and will be easier to maintain during the deployment stage. In the
   current literature, data-driven variable selection methods have been
   investigated within the context of spectroscopic data and
   bioinformatics. In these studies, the variable selection methods assume
   that the inherent correlation in the entire data set remains fixed. This
   is not the case in common industrial processes. In this paper, existing
   variable selection methods based on partial least squares (PLS) will
   first be evaluated. Second, we will present a new approach called moving
   window variable importance in projection (MW-VIP) to target the
   selection of correlations present in segments or small clusters.
   Finally, a set of new evaluation criteria will be presented along with
   industrial data set modeling results to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems in the United States vary in terms of
   design and operation. To better understand common practices in the RWH
   community and motivation for collecting harvested rainwater, an
   electronic survey was used to poll members of the American Rainwater
   Catchment Systems Association (ARCSA). Two hundred and twenty-two
   members of ARCSA responded to the survey; the responses were
   representative of approximately 2700 RWH systems across the United
   States that the respondents own, have installed, or have observed in the
   field. Survey questions focused on system setup, catchment materials
   (for the roof, cistern storage tank, gutters, and downspouts),
   motivation for harvesting rainwater, uses for the water, treatment
   methods, and water quality testing practices. Results indicate that
   composite asphalt shingles and metal are the most commonly used roofing
   materials for RWH, and polyethylene is the most common cistern material
   for the surveyed population. The most commonly reported use for
   harvested rainwater was irrigation although greater than 25\% of the
   respondents use their rainwater for potable purposes. Of the potable
   users, greater than 70\% utilize ultraviolet (UV) light as their primary
   treatment method, and approximately 21\% conduct no water quality
   testing. This survey provides critical data about current non-potable
   and potable RWH practices in the United States and can be used to guide
   future RWH research. In particular, the low frequency of water quality
   testing and the efficacy of UV treatment should be investigated further
   as the number of RWH systems installed in the United States and
   elsewhere continues to grow. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{SrMo0.9Co0.1O3.4 oxide has been prepared, characterized and tested as
   anode material in single solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC), yielding output
   powers close to 800 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C with pure H-2 as a fuel.
   This excellent performance is accounted for the results of an
   ``in-situ{''} neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiment, at the
   working conditions of a SOFC, showing the presence of a sufficiently
   high oxygen deficiency, with large displacement factors for oxygen atoms
   that suggest a large lability and mobility, combined with a huge
   metal-like electronic conductivity, as high as 386 S cm(-1) at T = 50
   degrees C. Besides, the oxidation of the perovskite gives rise to a new
   oxygen deficient scheelite-like phase with formula SrMo0.9Co0.1O4-delta
   with Mo(VI), which has been studied by NPD and thermal analysis as far
   as crystal structure and composition are concerned. An adequate thermal
   expansion coefficient for both (oxidized and reduced) phases, an
   excellent reversibility upon cycling in oxidizing reducing atmospheres
   and a good chemical compatibility with the electrolyte
   (La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta; LSGM) make this oxide a good candidate

Abstract = {{In this Letter, a bilaminate acoustic cloak designed using scattering
   cancellation methods is applied to the case of an acoustic sensor
   consisting of a hollow piezoelectric shell with mechanical absorption.
   The bilaminate cloak provides 20-50 dB reduction in scattering strength
   relative to the uncloaked configuration over the typical range of
   operation for an acoustic sensor, retains its ability to sensing
   acoustic pressure signals, and remains within the physical bounds of a
   passive absorber. Further, the cloak is shown to increase the range of
   frequencies over which there is nearly perfect phase fidelity between
   the acoustic signal and the voltage generated by the sensor. The
   feasibility of achieving the necessary fluid layer properties is
   demonstrated using sonic crystals with the use of readily available
   acoustic materials. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Large-core silica multimode fibers, whose core diameters are generally
   50 mu m or 62.5 mu m, form the bulk of short and medium haul optical
   fiber links in existence today, owing to their low cost and ease of
   deployment. However, modal dispersion significantly limits the maximum
   data rates that they support. Recently, the ability to multiplex several
   streams of data through optical fibers has spawned the development of
   few-mode multimode fibers. These fibers possess the low-dispersion
   characteristics of single-mode fibers and the ability to multiplex
   several data streams using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   techniques and mode-specific filtering to increase data rates. While
   fibers with larger core diameters possess a larger number of spatial
   modes, they do not support data rates as high as few-mode fibers. In
   this paper, we describe a simulation based approach to characterize the
   tradeoffs between fiber diameter, achievable data rates and alignment
   tolerances of coherent links that employ graded-index multimode fibers
   (MMFs) of various dimensions, using the information theoretic outage
   capacity as the metric. The simulations used fibers' intermodal coupling
   characteristics to measure its multiplexing abilities and dispersion
   limitations with mode-specific filters and launch and detection spatial
   filter arrays. The simulations indicate that the bandwidth-length
   product achievable over few-mode fibers with MIMO techniques can exceed
   250 Gb/s-km, while heavy mode spreading and limited mode selectivity
   limits the bandwidth-length product to under 25 Gb/s-km in fibers core
   diameters larger than 50 mu m. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new mechanism to realize negative refraction and planar
   focusing using a pair of parity-time symmetric metasurfaces. In contrast
   to existing solutions that achieve these effects with negative-index
   metamaterials or phase conjugating surfaces, the proposed parity-time
   symmetric lens enables loss-free, all-angle negative refraction and
   planar focusing in free space, without relying on bulk metamaterials or

   loss-free negative refraction and highly efficient planar focusing by
   exploiting the largely uncharted scattering properties of parity-time

Abstract = {{The use of energy relay dyes in dye sensitized solar cells presents an
   opportunity to improve efficiency by increasing the range of absorption
   of the solar spectrum. In experiments, relay dyes have achieved high
   efficiency of energy transfer to the sensitizing dye, but the overall
   power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells is not yet competitive
   with single-dye dye sensitized solar cells. Using kinetic Monte Carlo
   simulations, we explored how energy transfer among relay dyes affects
   the energy transfer to sensitizing dyes and found that high
   concentrations of energy relay dyes with high rates of homotransfer (a
   large donor-to-donor Forster radius) can be used to improve the
   efficiency of excitation transfer to the sensitizing dyes. We examined
   the effect of Forster radii, quenching, pore size, and dye concentration
   on the excitation transfer efficiency. The improved understanding of the
   interplay between the donor donor and donor acceptor Forster transfer
   radii effectively relaxes requirements and expands the spectrum of
   molecules that can be used as energy relay dyes in dye sensitized solar
   cells, opening up the possibility of solar cells with relay dyes
   surpassing single-dye cells in efficiency.}},

Title = {{Quenched Assembly of NIR-Active Gold Nanoclusters Capped with Strongly

Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{26}},

Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Gold nanospheres coated with a binary monolayer of bound citrate and
   cysteine ligands were assembled into nanodusters, in which the size and
   near-infrared (NIR) extinction were tuned by varying the pH and
   concentration of added NaCl. During full evaporation of an aqueous
   dispersion of 4.5 +/- 1.8 nm Au primary particles, the nanodusters were
   formed and quenched by the triblock copolymer polylactic acid
   (PLA)(1K)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)(10K)-b-PLA(1K), which also
   provided steric stabilization. The short-ranged depletion and van der
   Waals attractive forces were balanced against longer ranged
   electrostatic repulsion to tune the nanocluster diameter and NW
   extinction. Upon lowering the pH from 7 to 5 at a given salinity, the
   magnitude of the charge on the primary particles decreased, such that
   the weaker electrostatic repulsion increased the hydrodynamic diameter
   and, consequently, NW extinction of the clusters. At a given pH, as the
   concentration of NaCl was increased, the NIR extinction decreased
   monotonically. Furthermore, the greater screening of the charges on the
   nanodusters weakened the interactions with PLA(1K)-b-PEG(10K)-b-PLA(1K)
   and thus lowered the amount of adsorbed polymer on the nanocluster
   surface. The generalization of the concept of self-assembly of small
   NIR-active nanodusters to include a strongly bound thiol and the
   manipulation of the morphologies and NW extinction by variation of pH
   and salinity not only is of fundamental interest but also is important
   for optical biomedical imaging and therapy.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, bit error rate (BER) performance of multiple input
   multiple output (MIMO) systems employing transmit antenna selection with
   maximal ratio combining (TAS/MRC) and orthogonal space time block codes
   (OSTBC) is analysed and compared. Analysis has been done for several
   modulation schemes in equicorrelated Rayleigh fading channels. Novel
   infinite series expressions for BER of TAS/MRC are proposed in this
   work. The authors observe that the existing literature on performance
   analysis of TAS/MRC in correlated channels implicitly or explicitly
   assume no correlation on the transmitter side. In this work the authors
   overcome this shortcoming. An alternate closed-form expression for BER
   performance of OSTBC MIMO systems is derived. This closed-form
   expression is computationally efficient than existing expressions. Monte
   Carlo simulations were performed to validate the analytical results. It
   has been observed that TAS/MRC outperforms OSTBC in terms of BER
   performance in equicorrelated Rayleigh fading channel. As a case study,
   performance comparison of cognitive radio (CR) links employing OSTBC and
   TAS/MRC MIMO systems is investigated in order to show the usefulness of
   the present analytical study. Even though TAS is the optimum transmit
   antenna technique in terms of BER performance, OSTBC seems to be a
   promising alternative for more realistic scenarios in CR systems.}},

Abstract = {{Intersubband transitions in n-doped multi-quantum-well semiconductor
   heterostructures make it possible to engineer one of the largest known
   nonlinear optical responses in condensed matter systems-but this
   nonlinear response is limited to light with electric field polarized
   normal to the semiconductor layers(1-7). In a different context,
   plasmonic metasurfaces (thin conductor-dielectric composite materials)
   have been proposed as a way of strongly enhancing light-matter
   interaction and realizing ultrathin planarized devices with exotic wave
   properties(8-11). Here we propose and experimentally realize
   metasurfaces with a record-high nonlinear response based on the coupling
   of electromagnetic modes in plasmonic metasurfaces with
   quantum-engineered electronic intersubband transitions in semiconductor
   heterostructures. We show that it is possible to engineer almost any
   element of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of these structures, and
   we experimentally verify this concept by realizing a 400-nm-thick
   metasurface with nonlinear susceptibility of greater than 5 x 10(4)
   picometres per volt for second harmonic generation at a wavelength of
   about 8 micrometres under normal incidence. This susceptibility is many
   orders of magnitude larger than any second-order nonlinear response in
   optical metasurfaces measured so far(12-15). The proposed structures can
   act as ultrathin highly nonlinear optical elements that enable efficient
   frequency mixing with relaxed phase-matching conditions, ideal for
   realizing broadband frequency up-and down-conversions, phase conjugation
   and all-optical control and tunability over a surface.}},

Abstract = {{A completely organic solvent-free fabrication method is developed for
   tissue engineering scaffolds by gas foaming of immiscible polylactic
   acid (PLA) and sucrose blends, followed by water leaching. PLA scaffolds
   with above 90\% porosity and 25-200 mu m pore size were fabricated. The
   pore size and porosity was controlled with process parameters including
   extrusion temperature and foaming process parameters. Dynamic mechanical
   analysis showed that the extrusion temperature could be used to control
   the scaffold strength. Both unfoamed and foamed scaffolds were used to
   culture glioblastoma (GBM) cells M059K. The results showed that the
   cells grew better in the foamed PLA scaffolds. The method presented in
   the paper is versatile and can be used to fabricate tissue engineering
   scaffolds without any residual organic solvents.}},

   to several problems in fluid dynamics whose solutions exhibit boundary

   DPG as a numerical method for compressible flow is assessed with the
   application of DPG to two model problems over a range of Mach numbers

   the application to determine the most commonly executed trace of basic
   blocks which are then extracted. Traces are executed speculatively
   within the FPGA. If the control flow exits the trace prematurely, the
   side effects of the computation are rolled back and the request packet

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{An analytical element is proposed that is capable of simulating the
   lateral-strength degradation behavior of frame members subjected to
   seismic loading up to severe loss in lateral strength. Although element
   capabilities allow simulating the behavior of a wide range of frame
   members exhibiting loss of lateral strength, they were developed with
   the behavior of shear-critical reinforced concrete columns in mind. The
   element consists of a zero-length shear spring that connects in series
   with a beam-column flexural element. The proposed element can
   dynamically monitor beam-column elements for user-defined limiting
   forces and flexural deformations, and initiate degradation when either
   is reached. Upon initiation of degradation, the material model governing
   the behavior of the zero-length shear spring changes its constitutive
   properties to include pinching, strength degradation, and stiffness
   degradation. Cycle-, energy-, and displacement-based damage accumulation
   methods were implemented to provide users with the necessary tools to
   model a variety of frame members. A novel flexural-deformation
   compensation algorithm was implemented in the element that automatically
   adjusts the shear-spring stiffness and backbone curve such that a
   symmetric member response is achieved. The versatile element is shown to
   possess the necessary capabilities to simulate the nonlinear shear
   behavior and strength degradation of select reinforced concrete columns
   with only a limited number of parameters calibrated. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{An automated method for visualizing oil spill forecasts using Google

   (GENERAL NOAA Operational Modeling Environment). and visualizes the

   Python code, HyosPy can run multiple instances of the hydrodynamic and
   oil spill models to provide a set of multiple predicted spill tracks
   controlled by different wind and tide forecasts Automation of HyosPy
   allows the hydrodynamic model to be continuously running on a server so
   that hydrodynamic forecasts are immediately available in the event of a
   spill. Once the size, location, and time of the oil spill are provided
   to the system, no further human intervention is necessary. Google

Abstract = {{Multicomponent cation exchange reactions have important applications in

   profiles for a particular case of heterovalent cations (Na+, Ca2+ and
   Mg2+) and an anion (Cl-) for any combination of constant injection and
   constant initial composition using this theory. We assume local
   equilibrium, neglect dispersion and model the displacement as a Riemann
   problem using mass action laws, the charge conservation equation and the
   cation exchange capacity equation. The theoretical predictions have been
   compared with experimental data available at two scales-the laboratory
   scale and the field scale. The theory agrees well with the experimental

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{6129-6134}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It has been known for decades that isothermal flow fields in porous
   media can become unstable, resulting in the growth of preferential flow
   paths and nonmonotonic moisture profiles. The standard approach to
   modeling isothermal fluid transport in a porous systems is to use
   Richards equation with equilibrium relationships for the driving
   potential and monotonic transport coefficients. However, it is well
   known that under these conditions, solutions to Richards' equation are
   unconditionally stable. This has left open the question of whether
   Richards' equation could predict the onset of flow field instability,
   and what is required to model it. Importantly, past work has shown that
   pore scale processes can actually cause nonequilibrium driving
   potentials to arise in unsaturated media. How these can lead to flow
   field instability can be understood using a form of spectral
   perturbation theory. Here the driving potential is represented using a
   Fourier expansion, which is then substituted into Richards equation. The
   result shows that the evolution of perturbations to the flow field are
   affected by the interaction between different wavelength components in
   the Fourier expansion. In particular, there are situations where
   nonequilibrium driving potentials can set up conditions that would allow
   the onset of instability in solutions to Richards' equation.}},

Abstract = {{Multidetector logging-while-drilling (LWD) Sigma was introduced to the
   oil industry to measure neutron absorption cross section (Sigma) and
   radial length of invasion in shallow-invaded formations. Sigma
   quantifies the ability of a material to absorb thermal neutrons and is
   calculated from the late time portion of the time decay of thermal
   neutrons or gamma rays generated from thermal-neutron absorption. The
   assessment of invasion is made possible with the combination of a
   thermal-neutron detector and two gamma-ray detectors with different
   source-detector spacings. However, the interpretation of LWD Sigma logs
   is often affected by several environmental and/or geometric effects that
   can mask the formation response. A fast numerical simulation method
   embedded with inversion-based techniques can be used to estimate
   intrinsic formation Sigma from bore-hole measurements affected by
   shoulder-bed, invasion, and/or environmental effects. We developed a
   fast and accurate method to numerically simulate LWD multidetector
   thermal-neutron and gamma-ray time decays in realistic borehole
   environments. The method relies on Monte Carlo precalculated libraries
   of particle time decays and detector-specific flux sensitivity
   functions, while accounting for detector-specific borehole and diffusion
   effects. Simulations are benchmarked against test-pit measurements and
   Monte Carlo N-particle (MCNP) transport code calculations. Results
   indicate that multidetector time decays acquired under complex
   geometrical conditions can be numerically simulated in approximately
   1e-5 the time required using MCNP, with average difference within two
   capture units. The simulation of time decays, rather than Sigma itself
   enables a direct relationship between actual rock Sigma and
   multidetector diffusion-affected time decays, thereby removing
   intermediate correction steps often used to convert apparent into
   intrinsic formation Sigma.}},

Abstract = {{We study epidemic spreading processes in large networks, when the spread
   is assisted by a small number of external agents: infection sources with
   bounded spreading power, but whose movement is unrestricted vis-a-vis
   the underlying network topology. For networks, which are spatially
   constrained, we show that the spread of infection can be significantly
   speeded up even by a few such external agents infecting randomly.
   Moreover, for general networks, we derive upper bounds on the order of
   the spreading time achieved by certain simple (random/greedy)
   external-spreading policies. Conversely, for certain common classes of
   networks such as line graphs, grids, and random geometric graphs, we
   also derive lower bounds on the order of the spreading time over all
   (potentially network-state aware and adversarial) external-spreading
   policies; these adversarial lower bounds match (up to logarithmic
   factors) the spreading time achieved by an external agent with a random
   spreading policy. This demonstrates that random, state-oblivious
   infection-spreading by an external agent is in fact order-wise optimal
   for spreading in such spatially constrained networks.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the benefits of channel-aware (opportunistic) scheduling
   of transmissions in ad hoc networks. The key challenge in optimizing the
   performance of such systems is finding a good compromise among three
   interdependent quantities: 1) the density of scheduled transmitters; 2)
   the quality of transmissions; and 3) the long term fairness among nodes.
   We propose two new channel-aware slotted CSMA protocols opportunistic
   CSMA and quantile-based CSMA (QT-CSMA) and develop new stochastic
   geometric models to quantify their performance in terms of spatial reuse
   and spatial fairness. When properly optimized, these protocols offer
   substantial improvements in performance relative to CSMA-particularly,
   when the density of nodes is moderate to high. In addition, we show that
   a simple version of QT-CSMA can achieve robust performance gains without
   requiring careful parameter optimization. The quantitative results in
   this paper suggest that channel-aware scheduling in ad hoc networks can
   provide substantial benefits which might far outweigh the associated
   implementation overheads.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze a novel architecture for caching popular video content to
   enable wireless device-to-device (D2D) collaboration. We focus on the
   asymptotic scaling characteristics and show how they depend on video
   content popularity statistics. We identify a fundamental conflict
   between collaboration distance and interference and show how to optimize
   the transmission power to maximize frequency reuse. Our main result is a
   closed form expression of the optimal collaboration distance as a
   function of the model parameters. Under the common assumption of a Zipf
   distribution for content reuse, we show that if the Zipf exponent is
   greater than 1, it is possible to have a number of D2D interference-free
   collaboration pairs that scales linearly in the number of nodes. If the
   Zipf exponent is smaller than 1, we identify the best possible scaling
   in the number of D2D collaborating links. Surprisingly, a very simple
   distributed caching policy achieves the optimal scaling behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents a novel mismatch shaping technique for multibit
   delta-sigma digital-to-analog converters (DACs). It uses the intrinsic
   quantization noise to randomize the element selection. Different from
   most existing mismatch shaping techniques that increase the element
   transition activity, the proposed technique keeps the same transition
   rate as that for the basic thermometer coding scheme. As a result, it
   produces much lower intersymbol interference (ISI)-induced distortions.
   Moreover, it does not produce tones and can high-pass shape the mismatch
   errors, unlike thermometer coding that produces large distortions due to
   static mismatch. An efficient hardware implementation based on the
   vector-quantizer mismatch shaping framework is also presented.
   Simulations show that the proposed technique can significantly improve
   DAC linearity in the presence of both ISI and mismatch errors.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Naturally occurring error fields as well as resonant magnetic
   perturbations applied for stability control are known to cause magnetic
   field-line chaos in the scrape-off layer (SOL) region of tokamaks. Here,
   2D simulations with the BOUT++ simulation framework are used to
   investigate the effect of the field-line chaos on the SOL and in
   particular on its width and peak particle flux. The chaos enters the SOL
   dynamics only through the connection length, which is evaluated using a
   Poincare map. The variation of experimentally relevant quantities, such
   as the SOL gradient length scale and the intermittency of the particle
   flux in the SOL, is described as a function of the strength of the
   magnetic perturbation. It is found that the effect of the chaos is to
   broaden the profile of the sheath-loss coefficient, which is
   proportional to the inverse connection length. That is, the SOL
   transport in a chaotic field is equivalent to that in a model where the
   sheath-loss coefficient is replaced by its average over the unperturbed
   flux surfaces. The model does not include the effects of chaotic
   features other than the parallel connection length. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{For understanding the mechanisms of low-level laser/light therapy

   necessary. We present a three-dimensional, multilayer reduced-variance

   absorption in human skin. Local profiles of light penetration and
   volumetric absorption were calculated for uniform as well as Gaussian
   profile beams with different spreads over the spectral range from 1000
   to 1900 nm. The results showed that lasers within this wavelength range
   could be used to effectively and safely deliver energy to specific skin
   layers as well as achieve large penetration depths for treating deep
   tissues, without causing skin damage. In addition, by changing the beam
   profile from uniform to Gaussian, the local volumetric dosage could
   increase as much as three times for otherwise similar lasers. We expect
   that this tool along with the results presented will aid researchers in
   selecting wavelength and laser power in LLLT. (C) 2014 Society of

Abstract = {{RF Ablation of VT in Chronic Cocaine Users. Background: Cocaine use is a
   known but rare cause of cardiac arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias
   related to cocaine may not respond to antiarrhythmic drugs and may need
   treatment with radiofrequency ablation.
   Objectives: We describe the clinical and electrophysiological
   characteristics of cocaine-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) from a
   multicenter registry. Methods: Subjects presenting with VT related to
   cocaine use and being considered for radiofrequency ablation have been
   included in the study. Patients who were refractory to maximal medical
   therapy underwent radiofrequency ablation of the VT. Clinical,
   procedural variables, efficacy, and safety outcomes were assessed.
   Results: A total of 14 subjects met study criteria (age 44 +/- 13, range
   18- to 68-year-old with 79\% male, 71\% Caucasian). MRI showed evidence
   of scar only in 43\% of patients (6/14). The mechanism of VT was focal
   in 50\% (n = 7) and scar related reentry in 50\% (n = 7) based on 3D
   mapping. The mean VT cycle length was 429 +/- 96 milliseconds. The site
   of origin was epicardial in 16\% (3/18) of VTs. Most clinical VTs were
   hemodynamically stable (75\%). Mean ejection fraction at the time of
   admission was 44 +/- 14\%. Duration of procedure was 289 +/- 50 minutes.
   One subject developed pericardial tamponade requiring drainage. At 18
   +/- 11 months follow-up, freedom from arrhythmia was seen in 86\% (1
   case lost to follow-up and 2 died).
   Conclusion: Radiofrequency ablation is not only feasible but also safe
   and effective in patients who have drug refractory VT related to chronic
   cocaine use.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that refactoring improves software quality and
   developer productivity. However, few empirical studies quantitatively
   assess refactoring benefits or investigate developers' perception
   towards these benefits. This paper presents a field study of refactoring
   benefits and challenges at Microsoft through three complementary study
   methods: a survey, semi-structured interviews with professional software
   engineers, and quantitative analysis of version history data. Our survey
   finds that the refactoring definition in practice is not confined to a
   rigorous definition of semantics-preserving code transformations and
   that developers perceive that refactoring involves substantial cost and
   risks. We also report on interviews with a designated refactoring team
   that has led a multiyear, centralized effort on refactoring Windows. The
   quantitative analysis of Windows 7 version history finds the top 5
   percent of preferentially refactored modules experience higher reduction
   in the number of inter-module dependencies and several complexity
   measures but increase size more than the bottom 95 percent. This
   indicates that measuring the impact of refactoring requires
   multidimensional assessment.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new scheme for increasing the throughput of video files in
   cellular communications systems. This scheme exploits (1) the redundancy
   of user requests as well as (2) the considerable storage capacity of
   smartphones and tablets. Users cache popular video files and-after
   receiving requests from other users-serve these requests via
   device-to-device localized transmissions. The file placement is optimal
   when a central control knows a priori the locations of wireless devices
   when file requests occur. However, even a purely random caching scheme
   shows only a minor performance loss compared to such a ``genie-aided{''}
   scheme. We then analyze the optimal collaboration distance, trading off
   frequency reuse with the probability of finding a requested file within
   the collaboration distance. We show that an improvement of spectral
   efficiency of one to two orders of magnitude is possible, even if there
   is not very high redundancy in video requests.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Performing link adaptation in a multiantenna and multiuser system is
   challenging because of the coupling between precoding, user selection,
   spatial mode selection and use of limited feedback about the channel.
   The problem is exacerbated by the difficulty of selecting the proper
   modulation and coding scheme when using orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (OFDM). This paper presents a data-driven approach to link
   adaptation for multiuser multiple input mulitple output (MIMO) OFDM
   systems. A machine learning classifier is used to select the modulation
   and coding scheme, taking as input the SNR values in the different
   subcarriers and spatial streams. A new approximation is developed to
   estimate the unknown interuser interference due to the use of limited
   feedback. This approximation allows to obtain SNR information at the
   transmitter with a minimum communication overhead. A greedy algorithm is
   used to perform spatial mode and user selection with affordable
   complexity, without resorting to an exhaustive search. The proposed
   adaptation is studied in the context of the IEEE 802.11ac standard, and
   is shown to schedule users and adjust the transmission parameters to the
   channel conditions as well as to the rate of the feedback channel.}},

Abstract = {{Early sourcing decisions have a critical impact on the performance of
   industrial construction projects. However, the industrial construction
   sector has been relatively understudied, especially the sourcing and
   supply chain practices typically implemented in early phases of capital
   projects. This study reports on how engineering-procure-construction
   (EPC) firms select suppliers in the early stages of the project.
   Particular focus involves the decisions firms make in sourcing process
   and the types and roles of supporting information. The paper reports on
   five case studies with large EPC firms. Data were collected from
   multiple individuals in each firm with extensive supporting
   documentation. A cross-case analysis describes similarities and
   differences between EPCs and helps to compare empirical findings with
   the broader literature. Findings contradict some areas of the
   literature, in particular the push for strategic supplier alliances.
   Other findings confirm the strategic importance of early procurement
   decisions to project performance and similarity across the types of
   decision drivers for supplier selection. Practitioners will find the
   case studies useful examples of current practice to compare with their
   corporate efforts. Researchers will similarly find details that extend
   extant literature, proposing new avenues for future research. (C) 2014

Title = {{A new mathematical model considering adsorption and desorption process

Abstract = {{It has proved that seepage flow of shale gas reservoirs is much more
   complicated compared to most conventional reservoirs due to massive
   multistage, multi-cluster hydraulic fracturing stimulations. It becomes
   crucially essential to develop new methods to better stimulate such a
   complex system, further understand the recovery mechanisms, and perfect
   optimization development plans of shale gas reservoirs. The published
   three linear flow models simplified the complex process and got very
   good results. However, desorption and adsorption mechanism, which is the
   key mechanism of shale gas reservoirs, was ignored. Consequently, in
   this paper, a numerical model considering desorption and adsorption
   process was established and solved under the polar coordinates and the
   Laplace space respectively to predict productivity of volume fractured
   horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs. Single well productivity
   formula and bottom hole pressure formula of shale gas reservoirs were
   developed. In addition, based on the new established numerical model and
   its analytical solution, productivity of a volume fractured horizontal
   wells in a shale gas reservoir of Western China were calculated and
   compared with both the actual production data and results predicted by
   Eclipse simulator. Results showed that the predicted results are in good
   agreement with the field test. Although the simplifications resulted in
   errors to some extend, the improved trilinear model can also be
   recommended for the production prediction of the fractured horizontal
   wells in shale gas reservoirs. It is concluded that computational
   convenience of the trilinear-flow solution makes it a practical
   alternative to more rigorous but computationally intensive and
   time-consuming solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Viscous oil resources have great potential to help meet the future
   demand for petroleum products as conventional resources are depleted.
   Currently high temperature steam injection is the recovery process of
   choice, with high energy intensity and associated greenhouse gas
   emissions. The work presented here explores a low-temperature
   solvent-only injection strategy targeting fractured systems. The warm
   solvent is in the vapor phase when injected into the reservoir but will
   condense when it contacts the cold oil and reservoir rock (liquid
   extraction). After the system has reached the target operating
   temperature, the injected solvent remains in the vapor phase when it
   contacts the oil (solvent-enhanced gravity drainage). The experiments
   discussed in this work explore the key parameters (permeability,
   temperature/pressure, in situ injection rate, and solvent type) that
   influence each production mechanism. The primary impact of decreasing
   permeability is a proportional decrease in film gravity drainage rate. A
   decrease in temperature slows the mass transfer during the liquid
   extraction phase and decreases the drainage rate during the film gravity
   drainage phase. Increasing the in situ injection rate leads to improved
   liquid extraction because of higher concentration gradient in the
   solvent-rich liquid phase at the oil/solvent interface. Solvent type
   affects both mechanisms and changes the nature and amount of asphaltene
   precipitation. Pentane yields relatively less asphaltene precipitate
   than butane (18 wt \% vs 11 wt \% asphaltene content in residual oil).
   Residual oil saturation was observed to increase as permeability and/or
   temperature were decreased.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the physics and fire behavior of grassland fuel
   using experimental and modeling results. Experimental characterization
   included intermediate-scale tests to determine the mass loss rates, heat
   release rates (HRRs), and flame heat fluxes of burning little bluestem
   (Schizachyrium scoparium) grass plants at various fuel moisture contents
   and external flow conditions. The experiments included single-plant
   tests, multiple-plant tests with no forced flow/wind, and multiple-plant
   tests in which a forced flow was directed over the plants to simulate
   wind. The burning characteristics of single plants and fire spread
   between multiple plants under various conditions are discussed. The
   computational tool, Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Dynamics Simulator
   (WFDS), was then used to model the experiments using both a prescribed
   HRR and the particle-based fuel element model (predicted HRR).
   Comparisons are made between the experimentally measured quantities and
   the results predicted by WFDS. The results of the WFDS simulations with
   a prescribed HRR are in good agreement with the measured heat fluxes for
   the multiple-plant tests with no wind. The results of the particle-based
   WFDS fuel element model are in good agreement with the experimentally
   measured mass loss rates and HRRs of the single-plant tests. The WFDS
   fuel element model effectively captures the different stages of burning
   of the little bluestem plant. For the prediction of heat fluxes in the
   wind tests, there are limitations in the use of the prescribed HRR
   model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Zymomonas mobilis is a bacterium that can produce ethanol by
   fermentation. Due to its unique metabolism and efficient ethanol
   production, Z. mobilis has attracted special interest for biofuel energy
   applications; an important area of study is the regulation of those
   specific metabolic pathways. Small RNAs (sRNAs) have been studied as
   molecules that function as transcriptional regulators in response to
   cellular stresses. While sRNAs have been discovered in various organisms
   by computational prediction and experimental approaches, their discovery
   in Z. mobilis has not yet been reported. In this study, we have applied
   transcriptome analysis and computational predictions to facilitate
   identification and validation of 15 novel sRNAs in Z. mobilis. We
   furthermore characterized their expression in the context of high and
   low levels of intracellular ethanol. Here, we report that 3 of the sRNAs
   (Zms2, Zms4, and Zms6) are differentially expressed under aerobic and
   anaerobic conditions, when low and high ethanol productions are
   observed, respectively. Importantly, when we tested the effect of
   ethanol stress on the expression of sRNAs in Z. mobilis, Zms2, Zms6, and
   Zms18 showed differential expression under 5\% ethanol stress
   conditions. These data suggest that in this organism regulatory RNAs can
   be associated with metabolic functions involved in ethanol stress
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Oral drug delivery is a route of choice for vaccine administration
   because of its noninvasive nature and thus efforts have focused on
   efficient delivery of vaccine antigens to mucosal sites. An effective
   oral vaccine delivery system must protect the antigen from degradation

   release of the antigen and costimulatory and immunomodulatory agents to
   specific immune cells (i.e., APCs). In this paper, mannan-modified
   pH-responsive P(HEMA-co-MAA) nanogels were synthesized and assessed as
   carriers for oral vaccination. The nanogels showed pH-sensitive
   properties, entrapping and protecting the loaded cargo at low pH values,
   and triggered protein release after switching to intestinal pH values.
   Surface decoration with mannan as carbohydrate moieties resulted in
   enhanced internalization by macrophages as well as increasing the
   expression of relevant costimulatory molecules. These findings indicate
   that mannan-modified P(HEMA-co-MAA) nanogels are a promising approach to
   a more efficacious oral vaccination regimen.}},

Abstract = {{Towards developing precise microsurgery tools for the clinic, we
   previously developed image-guided miniaturized devices using low
   repetition rate amplified ultrafast lasers for surgery. To improve the
   speed of tissue removal while reducing device diameter, here we present
   a new 5-mm diameter device that delivers high-repetition rate laser
   pulses for high speed ultrafast laser microsurgery. The device consists
   of an air-core photonic bandgap fiber (PBF) for the delivery of high
   energy pulses, a piezoelectric tube actuator for fiber scanning, and two
   aspheric lenses for focusing the light. Its inline optical architecture
   provides easy alignment and substantial size reduction to 5 mm diameter
   as compared to our previous MEMS-scanning devices while realizing
   improved intensity squared (two-photon) lateral and axial resolutions of
   1.16 mu m and 11.46 mu m, respectively. Our study also sheds light on
   the maximum pulse energies that can be delivered through the air-core
   PBF and identifies cladding damage at the input facet of the fiber as
   the limiting factor. We have achieved a maximum energy delivery larger
   than 700 nJ at 92\% coupling efficiency. An in depth analysis reveals
   how this value is greatly affected by possible slight misalignments of
   the beam during coupling and the measured small beam pointing
   fluctuations. In the absence of these imperfections, self-phase
   modulation becomes the limiting factor for the maximum energy delivery,
   setting the theoretical upper bound to near 2 mu J for a 1-m long, 7-mu
   m, air-core PBF. Finally, the use of a 300 kHz repetition rate fiber
   laser enabled rapid ablation of 150 mu m x 150 mu m area within only 50
   ms. Such ablation speeds can now allow the surgeons to translate the
   surgery device as fast as similar to 4 mm/s to continuously remove a
   thin layer of a 150 mu m wide tissue. Thanks to a high optical
   transmission efficiency of the in-line optical architecture of the
   device and improved resolution, we could successfully perform ablation
   of scarred cheek pouch tissue, drilling through a thin slice. With
   further development, this device can serve as a precise and high speed
   ultrafast laser scalpel in the clinic. (C) 2014 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Improved Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) blood flow analyses that
   incorporate inverse models of the underlying laser-tissue interaction
   have been used to develop more quantitative implementations of speckle
   flowmetry such as Multi-Exposure Speckle Imaging (MESI). In this paper,
   we determine the optimal camera exposure durations required for
   obtaining flow information with comparable accuracy with the prevailing
   MESI implementation utilized in recent in vivo rodent studies. A looping
   leave-one-out (LOO) algorithm was used to identify exposure subsets
   which were analyzed for accuracy against flows obtained from analysis
   with the original full exposure set over 9 animals comprising n = 314
   regional flow measurements. From the 15 original exposures, 6 exposures
   were found using the LOO process to provide comparable accuracy, defined
   as being no more than 10\% deviant, with the original flow measurements.
   The optimal subset of exposures provides a basis set of camera durations
   for speckle flowmetry studies of the microcirculation and confers a
   twofold faster acquisition rate and a 28\% reduction in processing time
   without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the optimization process can
   be used to identify further reductions in the exposure subsets for
   tailoring imaging over less expansive flow distributions to enable even

Abstract = {{Colorectal polyps are important precursors to colon cancer, a major
   health problem. Colon capsule endoscopy is a safe and minimally invasive
   examination procedure, in which the images of the intestine are obtained
   via digital cameras on board of a small capsule ingested by a patient.
   The video sequence is then analyzed for the presence of polyps. We
   propose an algorithm that relieves the labor of a human operator
   analyzing the frames in the video sequence. The algorithm acts as a
   binary classifier, which labels the frame as either containing polyps or
   not, based on the geometrical analysis and the texture content of the
   frame. We assume that the polyps are characterized as protrusions that
   are mostly round in shape. Thus, a best fit ball radius is used as a
   decision parameter of the classifier. We present a statistical
   performance evaluation of our approach on a data set containing over 18
   900 frames from the endoscopic video sequences of five adult patients.
   The algorithm achieves 47\% sensitivity per frame and 81\% sensitivity
   per polyp at a specificity level of 90\%. On average, with a video
   sequence length of 3747 frames, only 367 false positive frames need to
   be inspected by an operator.}},

Abstract = {{The orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) method has shown enhanced
   sampling efficiency in free energy calculations from previous studies.
   In this study, the implementation of OSRW in accordance with the
   polarizable AMOEBA force field in TINKER molecular modeling software
   package is discussed and subsequently applied to the hydration free
   energy calculation of 20 small organic molecules, among which IS are
   positively charged and five are neutral. The calculated hydration free
   energies of these molecules are compared with the results obtained from
   the Bennett acceptance ratio method using the same force field, and
   overall an excellent agreement is obtained. The convergence and the
   efficiency of the OSRW are also discussed and compared with BAR
   Combining enhanced sampling techniques such as OSRW with polarizable
   force fields is very promising for achieving both accuracy and
   efficiency in general free energy calculations.}},

Title = {{Planarizing material for reverse-tone step and flash imprint lithography}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Reverse-tone step and flash imprint lithography (S-FIL/R) requires
   materials that can be spin-coated onto patterned substrates with
   significant topography and that are highly planarizing. Ideally, these
   planarizing materials must contain silicon for etch selectivity, be UV
   or thermally curable, and have low viscosity and low volatility. One
   such unique material, in particular, a branched and functionalized
   siloxane (Si-12), is able to adequately satisfy the above requirements.
   This paper describes a study of the properties of epoxy functionalized
   Si-12 (epoxy-Si-12) as a planarizing layer. An efficient synthetic route
   to epoxy-Si-12 was successfully developed, which is suitable and
   scalable for an industrial process. Epoxy-Si-12 has a high silicon
   content (30.0\%), low viscosity (29 cP at 25 degrees C), and low vapor
   pressure (0.65 Torr at 25 degrees C). A planarizing study was carried
   out using epoxy-Si-12 on trench patterned test substrates. The material
   showed excellent planarizing properties and met the calculated critical
   degree of planarization (critical DOP), which is a requirement for a
   successful etch process. An S-FIL/R process using epoxy-Si-12 was
   demonstrated using an Imprio (R) 100 (Molecular Imprints Inc., Austin,
   Texas) imprint tool. The results indicate that epoxy-Si-12 works very
   well as a planarizing layer for S-FIL/R. (C) The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{464-476}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on developing a forecasting model for the water inflow
   at an hydroelectric plant's reservoir for operations planning. The
   planning horizon is 5 years in monthly steps. Due to the complex
   behavior of the monthly inflow time series we use a Bayesian dynamic
   linear model that incorporates seasonal and autoregressive components.
   We also use climate variables like monthly precipitation, El Nino and
   other indices as predictor variables when relevant. The Brazilian power
   system has 140 hydroelectric plants. Based on geographical
   considerations, these plants are collated by basin and classified into
   15 groups that correspond to the major river basins, in order to reduce
   the dimension of the problem. The model is then tested for these 15
   groups. Each group will have a different forecasting model that can best
   describe its unique seasonality and characteristics. The results show
   that the forecasting approach taken in this paper produces substantially
   better predictions than the current model adopted in Brazil (see Maceira
   \& Damazio, 2006), leading to superior operations planning. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We develop an efficient method for accurately calculating the electric
   field of tightly focused laser beams in the presence of specific
   configurations of microscopic scatterers. This Huygens-Fresnel
   wave-based electric field superposition (HF-WEFS) method computes the
   amplitude and phase of the scattered electric field in excellent
   agreement with finite difference time-domain (FDTD) solutions of
   Maxwell's equations. Our HF-WEFS implementation is 2-4 orders of
   magnitude faster than the FDTD method and enables systematic
   investigations of the effects of scatterer size and configuration on the
   focal field. We demonstrate the power of the new HF-WEFS approach by
   mapping several metrics of focal field distortion as a function of
   scatterer position. This analysis shows that the maximum focal field
   distortion occurs for single scatterers placed below the focal plane
   with an offset from the optical axis. The HF-WEFS method represents an
   important first step toward the development of a computational model of
   laser-scanning microscopy of thick cellular/tissue specimens. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Assessment of uncertainty due to inadequate data and imperfect
   geological knowledge is an essential aspect of the subsurface model
   building process. In this work, a novel methodology for characterizing
   complex geological structures is presented that integrates dynamic data.
   The procedure results in the assessment of uncertainty associated with
   the predictions of flow and transport. The methodology is an extension
   of a previously developed pattern search-based inverse method that
   models the spatial variation in flow parameters by searching for
   patterns in an ensemble of reservoir models. More specifically, the
   pattern-searching algorithm is extended in two directions: (1) state
   values (such as piezometric head) and parameters (such as
   conductivities) are simultaneously and sequentially estimated, which
   implies that real-time assimilation of dynamic data is possible as in
   ensemble filtering approaches; and (2) both the estimated parameter and
   state variables are considered when pattern searching is implemented.
   The new scheme results in two main advantages-better characterization of
   parameters, especially for delineating small scale features, and an
   ensemble of head states that can be used to update the parameter field
   using the dynamic data at the next instant, without running expensive
   flow simulations. An efficient algorithm for pattern search is
   developed, which works with a flexible search radius and can be
   optimized for the estimation of either large- or small-scale structures.
   Synthetic examples are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskite oxides have attracted significant attention as energy
   conversion materials for metal-air battery and solid-oxide fuel-cell
   electrodes owing to their unique physical and electronic properties.
   Amongst these unique properties is the structural stability of the
   cation array in perovskites that can accommodate mobile oxygen ions
   under electrical polarization. Despite oxygen ion mobility and vacancies
   having been shown to play an important role in catalysis, their role in
   charge storage has yet to be explored. Herein we investigate the
   mechanism of oxygen-vacancy-mediated redox pseudocapacitance for a
   nanostructured lanthanum-based perovskite, LaMnO3. This is the first
   example of anion-based intercalation pseudocapacitance as well as the
   first time oxygen intercalation has been exploited for fast energy
   storage. Whereas previous pseudocapacitor and rechargeable battery
   charge storage studies have focused on cation intercalation, the
   anion-based mechanism presented here offers a new paradigm for
   electrochemical energy storage.}},

Abstract = {{Coarse-grained models of atomic systems, created by aggregating groups
   of atoms into molecules to reduce the number of degrees of freedom, have
   been used for decades in important scientific and technological
   applications. In recent years, interest in developing a more rigorous
   theory for coarse graining and in assessing the predictivity of
   coarse-grained models has arisen. In this work, Bayesian methods for the
   calibration and validation of coarse-grained models of atomistic systems
   in thermodynamic equilibrium are developed. For specificity, only
   configurational models of systems in canonical ensembles are considered.
   Among major challenges in validating coarse-grained models are (1) the
   development of validation processes that lead to information essential
   in establishing confidence in the model's ability predict key quantities
   of interest and (2), above all, the determination of the coarse-grained
   model itself; that is, the characterization of the molecular
   architecture, the choice of interaction potentials and thus parameters,
   which best fit available data. The all-atom model is treated as the
   ``ground truth,{''} and it provides the basis with respect to which
   properties of the coarse-grained model are compared. This base all-atom
   model is characterized by an appropriate statistical mechanics framework
   in this work by canonical ensembles involving only configurational
   energies. The all-atom model thus supplies data for Bayesian calibration
   and validation methods for the molecular model. To address the first
   challenge, we develop priors based on the maximum entropy principle and
   likelihood functions based on Gaussian approximations of the
   uncertainties in the parameter-to-observation error. To address
   challenge (2), we introduce the notion of model plausibilities as a
   means for model selection. This methodology provides a powerful approach
   toward constructing coarse-grained models which are most plausible for
   given all-atom data. We demonstrate the theory and methods through
   applications to representative atomic structures and we discuss
   extensions to the validation process for molecular models of polymer
   structures encountered in certain semiconductor nanomanufacturing
   processes. The powerful method of model plausibility as a means for
   selecting interaction potentials for coarse-grained models is discussed
   in connection with a coarse-grained hexane molecule. Discussions of how
   all-atom information is used to construct priors are contained in an
   appendix.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel motion smoothing algorithm for hand-held cameras with
   application to video stabilization. Video stabilization seeks to remove
   unwanted frame-to-frame jitter due to camera shake. For video
   stabilization, we use a pure 3D rotation motion model with known camera
   projection parameters. The 3D camera rotation can be reliably tracked by
   a gyroscope as commonly found on a smart phone or tablet. In this paper,
   we directly smooth the sequence of camera rotation matrices for the
   video frames by exploiting the Riemannian geometry on a manifold. Our
   contributions are 1) formulation of motion smoothing as a
   geodesic-convex constrained regression problem on a nonlinear manifold
   based on geodesic distance, 2) computation of gradient and Hessian of
   the objective function using Riemannian geometry for gradient-related
   manifold optimization, and 3) generalization of the two-metric
   projection algorithm in Euclidean space to manifolds to solve the
   proposed manifold optimization problem efficiently. The
   geodesic-distance-based smoothness metric better exploits the manifold
   structure of sequences of rotation matrices. The geodesic-convex
   constraints effectively guarantee that no black borders intrude into the
   stabilized frames. The proposed manifold optimization algorithm can find
   the global optimal solution in only a few iterations. Experimental
   results show that video stabilization based on our motion smoothing
   algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating videos with
   less jitter and without black borders.}},

   partitioning between CO2 and brine}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{77-83}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A novel method is presented for measuring solubility in supercritical
   CO2 (scCO(2)), which can be used in conjunction with traditional cloud
   point measurements to obtain information directly on the soluble portion
   of a given sample and, ultimately, a much more informative data set. In
   this method, surfactant from a known amount of CO2 solution was
   transferred into an aqueous solution and the surfactant concentration of
   the aqueous solution was measured directly by HPLC (high-performance
   liquid chromatography). In this work, the partitioning of a series of
   2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) alkoxylate surfactants among an aqueous phase
   (water or brine) and scCO(2) as a function of electrolyte concentration,
   temperature, and pressure was also investigated. Surfactant partition
   coefficient was determined based on the reduction of HPLC measured
   surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase due to surfactant
   partitioning into CO2. An understanding of surfactant partitioning
   between brine and scCO(2) is particularly important in the design of CO2
   foam processes, particularly for surfactant stabilized foam in
   subsurface systems, where it can affect surfactant transport and foam
   propagation. In general, the solubility in scCO(2) increased with
   pressure and decreased with temperature. The partitioning of the
   surfactants between CO2 and water phases was almost proportional to
   pressure, and decreased as temperature increased, where the latter held
   more sensitivity. The partition coefficient was very sensitive to
   surfactant formula. For the 2-EH-PO5-EOx series, the partition
   coefficient between scCO(2) and the aqueous phase increased with
   decreasing EO content. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{EON: software for long time simulations of atomic scale systems}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The EON software is designed for simulations of the state-to-state
   evolution of atomic scale systems over timescales greatly exceeding that
   of direct classical dynamics. States are defined as collections of
   atomic configurations from which a minimization of the potential energy
   gives the same inherent structure. The time evolution is assumed to be
   governed by rare events, where transitions between states are
   uncorrelated and infrequent compared with the timescale of atomic
   vibrations. Several methods for calculating the state-to-state evolution
   have been implemented in EON, including parallel replica dynamics,
   hyperdynamics and adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo. Global optimization
   methods, including simulated annealing, basin hopping and minima hopping
   are also implemented. The software has a client/server architecture
   where the computationally intensive evaluations of the interatomic
   interactions are calculated on the client-side and the state-to-state
   evolution is managed by the server. The client supports optimization for
   different computer architectures to maximize computational efficiency.
   The server is written in Python so that developers have access to the
   high-level functionality without delving into the computationally
   intensive components. Communication between the server and clients is
   abstracted so that calculations can be deployed on a single machine,
   clusters using a queuing system, large parallel computers using a
   message passing interface, or within a distributed computing
   environment. A generic interface to the evaluation of the interatomic
   interactions is defined so that empirical potentials, such as in LAMMPS,
   and density functional theory as implemented in VASP and GPAW can be
   used interchangeably. Examples are given to demonstrate the range of
   systems that can be modeled, including surface diffusion and island
   ripening of adsorbed atoms on metal surfaces, molecular diffusion on the
   surface of ice and global structural optimization of nanoparticles.}},

   shear at failure were recorded for each test. The strength results
   indicated that the shear capacity of a deep beam is governed by the
   strength of the nodal regions, which are not directly proportional to
   the member depth. When deep beams are designed with strut-and-tie
   models, the strength of the nodal regions are addressed explicitly and

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that precursors to reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
   prevalent indoors, the concentration of ROS inside buildings is unknown.
   ROS on PM2.5 was measured inside and outside twelve residential
   buildings and eleven institutional and retail buildings. The mean ( +/-
   s.d.) concentration of ROS on PM2.5 inside homes (1.37 +/- 1.2
   nmoles/m(3)) was not significantly different from the outdoor
   concentration (1.41 +/- 1.0 nmoles/m(3)). Similarly, the indoor and
   outdoor concentrations of ROS on PM2.5 at institutional buildings (1.16
   +/- 0.38 nmoles/m(3) indoors and 1.68 +/- 1.3 nmoles/m(3) outdoors) and
   retail stores (1.09 +/- 0.93 nmoles/m(3) indoors and 1.12 +/- 1.1
   nmoles/m(3) outdoors) were not significantly different and were
   comparable to those in residential buildings. The indoor concentration
   of particulate ROS cannot be predicted based on the measurement of other
   common indoor pollutants, indicating that it is important to separately
   assess the concentration of particulate ROS in air quality studies.
   Daytime indoor occupational and residential exposure to particulate ROS
   dominates daytime outdoor exposure to particulate ROS. These findings
   highlight the need for further study of ROS in indoor microenvironments.

Abstract = {{This paper considers planar orbit transfers and rendezvous problems
   around a central body using Lyapunov stability theory. The model used is
   the Levi-Civita transformation of the planar two-body problem. One of
   the advantages of working in these transformed coordinates is that the
   solution to the unperturbed equations of motion is that of a simple
   harmonic oscillator, so the analytical solution is known at all times
   during coast phases. We design a closed-loop guidance scheme for orbit
   transfers from any initial elliptical orbit to any final elliptical
   orbit using a spacecraft with thrust-coast capabilities. A similar
   procedure is performed to design a control law for rendezvous with any
   desired target spacecraft. The proposed Lyapunov functions give rise to
   asymptotically stabilizing control laws. The algorithms designed are
   robust to initial and final conditions, computationally fast, and no
   restrictions are imposed on the magnitude of the thrust. The guidance
   scheme is also effective in a dynamic model where unmodeled
   perturbations are present.}},

Abstract = {{Tisserand-leveraging transfers (TILTs) are introduced as a new method
   for computing low-Delta v orbit transfers with the help of third-body
   perturbations. The TILTs can mitigate the costs and risk of planetary
   missions by reducing the orbit insertion maneuver requirements while
   maintaining short flight times. TILTs connect two flybys at the minor
   body with an impulsive maneuver at an apse. Using the circular,
   restricted three-body problem, TILTs extend the concept of v-infinity
   leveraging beyond the patched-conics domain. In this paper, a new method
   is presented to compute TILTs and to patch them together to design
   low-energy transfers. The presented solutions have transfer times
   similar to the high-energy solutions, yet the Delta v cost is
   significantly reduced. For this reason, TILTs are used in the reference
   endgame of ESA's new mission option to Ganymede, JUICE, which is also
   presented here. JUICE's low-energy endgame halves the cost of similar
   high-energy endgames, which makes TILTs a mission-enabling technology
   for JUICE. The ``lunar resonances{''} of SMART-1 are also explained in
   terms of low-thrust TILTs, suggesting future application of TILTs and
   low-thrust TILTs to design missions to the Moon and to other small-body
   destinations.}},

   in addition to its primary function to convert chemical energy into
   mechanical energy. In physical systems, the common mechanism for
   absorbing mechanical shock is achieved with the use of both elastic and
   viscous elements and we hypothesize that the viscosity of the skeletal
   muscle is a variable parameter which can be voluntarily controlled by
   changing the tension of the contracting muscle. We further hypothesize
   that an ability of muscle to absorb shock has been an important factor
   in biological evolution, allowing the life to move from the ocean to
   land, from hydrodynamic to aerodynamic environment with dramatically
   different loading conditions for musculoskeletal system. The ability of
   muscle to redistribute the energy of mechanical shock in time and space
   and unload skeletal joints is of key importance in physical activities.
   We developed a mathematical model explaining the absorption of
   mechanical shock energy due to the increased viscosity of contracting
   skeletal muscles. The developed model, based on the classical theory of
   sliding filaments, demonstrates that the increased muscle viscosity is a
   result of the time delay (or phase shift) between the mechanical impact
   and the attachment/detachment of myosin heads to binding sites on the
   actin filaments. The increase in the contracted muscle's viscosity is
   time dependent. Since the forward and backward rate constants for
   binding the myosin heads to the actin filaments are on the order of 100
   s(-1), the viscosity of the contracted muscle starts to significantly
   increase with an impact time greater than 0.01 s. The impact time is one
   of the key parameters in generating destructive stress in the colliding
   objects. In order to successfully dampen a short high power impact,
   muscles must first slow it down to engage the molecular mechanism of
   muscle viscosity. Muscle carries out two functions, acting first as a
   nonlinear spring to slow down impact and second as a viscous damper to
   absorb the impact. Exploring the ability of muscle to absorb mechanical
   shock may shed light to many problems of medical biomechanics and sports
   medicine. Currently there are no clinical devices for real-time
   quantitative assessment of viscoelastic properties of contracting
   muscles in vivo. Such assessment may be important for diagnosis and
   monitoring of treatment of various muscle disorders such as muscle
   dystrophy, motor neuron diseases, inflammatory and metabolic myopathies
   and many more. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to investigate the sensitivity of
   electrodialysis performance to variations in hydraulic flow when
   treating brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) concentrate waste. A
   synthetic BWRO concentrate from Arizona of 7890 mg/L total dissolved
   solids was prepared with poly-phosphonate antiscalants, and desalinated
   with a laboratory-scale electrodialyzer with 10 cell-pairs and a
   transfer area of 64 cm(2) per membrane. Flow, pressure, conductivity,
   temperature, and pH were measured continuously, and periodic process
   samples were analyzed by ion chromatography and inductively coupled
   plasma-optical emission spectrometry for anion and cation
   concentrations, respectively. The BWRO concentrate was successfully
   treated with a stack voltage application of 1.0 V/cell-pair and current
   densities less than 280 A/m(2) for salinity removal ratios up to 99\%
   (without precipitation). The superficial velocities were controlled in a
   range of 1.2 to 4.8 cm/s, which corresponded to Reynolds numbers of 10
   to 40. This paper shows the polarization parameter (ranging from 2.0 to
   3.6 A/m(2) per meq/L) as a function of Reynolds number and removal
   ratio, and, at maximum sensitivity, the polarization parameter was
   proportional to Reynolds number raised to the 0.132 power. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The theory and practice of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capture and
   control via Global Positioning System (GPS) signal spoofing are analyzed
   and demonstrated. The goal of this work is to explore UAV vulnerability
   to deceptive GPS signals. Specifically, this paper (1) establishes the
   necessary conditions for UAV capture via GPS spoofing, and (2) explores
   the spoofer's range of possible post-capture control over the UAV. A UAV
   is considered captured when a spoofer gains the ability to eventually
   specify the UAV's position and velocity estimates. During post-capture
   control, the spoofer manipulates the true state of the UAV, potentially
   resulting in the UAV flying far from its flight plan without raising
   alarms. Both overt and covert spoofing strategies are considered, as
   distinguished by the spoofer's attempts to evade detection by the target
   GPS receiver and by the target navigation system's state estimator,
   which is presumed to have access to non-GPS navigation sensor data. GPS
   receiver tracking loops are analyzed and tested to assess the spoofer's
   capability for covert capture of a mobile target. The coupled dynamics
   of a UAV and spoofer are analyzed and simulated to explore practical
   post-capture control scenarios. A field test demonstrates capture and
   rudimentary control of a rotorcraft UAV, which results in unrecoverable
   navigation errors that cause the UAV to crash. (C) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{This research encompasses the study of testing protocols and the design
   of sensors for evaluating the compressive strength of the char layer of
   ablative material used in solid rocket motors (SRMs). The testing
   protocol that has been developed is the continuation of previous work
   for determining the compressive strengths between different SRM
   insulation materials. A crushing test method was further developed, and
   a sensor platform was assembled to perform the tests. The test procedure
   consists of measuring the amount of force required to crush a given area
   of the charred sample for a specified depth. The test was repeated for
   the industry standard Kevlar (R)-filled ethylene propylene diene monomer
   rubber and thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer nanocomposite with
   different weight loading of multi-walled carbon nanotubes,
   montmorillonite nanoclay, and carbon nanofibers. The energy of
   destruction or energy dissipated was quantified to determine which
   ablative exhibited the best performance. Maximum force was also recorded
   as a secondary quantity to determine char strength. The proposed test
   method is fully automated to ensure repeatability of each measurement
   and to remove the potential for human-induced error. Because char layer
   thickness varies depending on the material, a method of differentiating
   neat material from char was proposed and explored. The introduced
   procedure also represents a novel and unique approach to solve the
   problem of the determination of the char strength. Copyright (c) 2014

Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Due to the long time scales associated with soot evolution and its
   sensitivity to the background thermochemical state, even small errors in
   a turbulent combustion model have the potential to lead to large errors
   in soot evolution. For example, in turbulent jet flames, small upstream
   errors in the temperature and species concentrations could lead to large
   errors in soot volume fraction downstream. In this work, an algorithm is
   developed for propagating upstream errors in the thermochemical state,
   specifically, the temperature, into soot predictions downstream. The
   algorithm is based on a stochastic collocation approach that perturbs
   the reaction progress variable in the flamelet model at an upstream
   location and lets this error passively propagate downstream in the soot
   and combustion models (i.e., the hydrodynamic field is unaffected). The
   approach is applied to the simulation of Delft Flame III, a natural gas
   turbulent nonpremixed piloted jet flame for which both upstream
   temperature measurements and downstream soot volume fraction
   measurements are available. The results indicate that upstream errors in
   temperature, which are within the experimental uncertainty, can lead to
   errors in the soot volume fraction downstream up to 30\%; the downstream
   error in the temperature is comparable in magnitude to the upstream
   perturbation. Further analysis reveals that the primary source of the
   downstream error in soot volume fraction is the accumulation of errors
   in the soot precursor mass fraction with downstream distance. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Diagnosis of resistant hypertension (RH) is currently based upon
   awake-time office blood pressure (BP). An increasing number of studies
   have documented abnormally elevated sleep-time BP in most RH patients,
   indicating that diagnosis of true RH cannot be determined solely by
   comparison of office BP with either patient awake-time BP
   self-measurements or awake-BP mean from ambulatory monitoring (ABPM), as
   is customary in the published literature. Moreover, the ABPM-determined
   sleep-time BP mean is an independent and stronger predictor of
   cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) risk than either
   daytime office/ABPM-derived awake or 24-hour means. Results of the
   recently completed MAPEC (Monitorizacion Ambulatoria para Prediccion de
   Eventos Cardiovasculares) prospective outcomes study, which included a
   large cohort of RH patients, established that time of treatment relative
   to circadian rhythms constituted a critically important yet often
   neglected variable with respect to BP control. The study found that
   bedtime versus morning ingestion of the full dose of >= 1 BP-lowering
   medications resulted in both better therapeutic normalization of
   sleep-time BP and reduced CVD morbidity and mortality, including in RH
   patients. Accordingly, ABPM is highly recommended to properly diagnose
   and manage true RH, with a bedtime hypertension medication regimen as
   the therapeutic scheme of choice.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated thermal operating characteristics of 13
   commercially available cryotherapy units (CTUs) and their associated
   cooling pads using IR imaging. Quantitative examination of the

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to compare the heat shock responses of cells
   grown in 2D and 3D culture environments as indicated by the level of
   heat shock protein 70 expression and the incidence of apoptosis and
   necrosis of prostate cancer cell lines in response to graded
   hyperthermia. PC3 cells were stably transduced with a dual reporter
   system composed of two tandem expression cassettes-a conditional heat
   shock protein promoter driving the expression of green fluorescent
   protein (HSPp-GFP) and a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter controlling the
   constitutive expression of a ``beacon{''} red fluorescent protein
   (CMVp-RFP). Two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures of PC3
   prostate cancer cells were grown in 96-well plates for evaluation of
   their time-dependent response to supraphysiological temperature. To
   induce controlled hyperthermia, culture plates were placed on a flat
   copper surface of a circulating water manifold that maintained the
   specimens within +/- 0.1 degrees C of a target temperature. Hyperthermia
   protocols included various combinations of temperature, ranging from 37
   degrees C to 57 degrees C, and exposure times of up to 2 h. The majority
   of protocols were focused on temperature and time permutations, where
   the response gradient was greatest. Post-treatment analysis by flow
   cytometry analysis was used to measure the incidences of apoptosis
   (annexin V-FITC stain), necrosis (propidium iodide (PI) stain), and
   HSP70 transcription (GFP expression). Cells grown in 3D compared with 2D
   culture showed reduced incidence of apoptosis and necrosis and a higher
   level of HSP70 expression in response to heat shock at the temperatures
   tested. Cells responded differently to hyperthermia when grown in 2D and
   3D cultures. Three-dimensional culture appears to enhance survival
   plausibly by activating protective processes related to enhanced-HSP70
   expression. These differences highlight the importance of selecting
   physiologically relevant 3D models in assessing cellular responses to
   hyperthermia in experimental settings.}},

   ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{One of the main issues with vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) is
   that vanadium ions travel across the membrane during operation which
   leads to a concentration imbalance and capacity loss after long-term
   cycling. Precise state-of-charge (SOC) monitoring allows the operator to
   effectively schedule electrolyte rebalancing and devise a control
   strategy to keep the battery running under optimal conditions. However,
   current SOC monitoring methods are too expensive and impractical to
   implement on commercial VRFB systems. Furthermore, physical models alone
   are neither reliable nor accurate enough to predict long-term capacity
   loss due to crossover. In this paper, we present an application of using
   an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the total vanadium
   concentration in each half-cell by combining three voltage measurements
   and a state prediction model without crossover effects. Simulation
   results show that the EKF can accurately predict capacity loss for
   different crossover patterns over a few hundred cycles.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The wandering motion of tip vortices trailed from a hovering helicopter
   rotor is described. This aperiodicity is known to cause errors in the
   determination of vortex properties that are crucial inputs for refined
   aerodynamic analyses of helicopter rotors. Measurements of blade tip
   vortices up to 260 deg vortex age using stereo particle-image
   velocimetry (PIV) indicate that this aperiodicity is anisotropic. We
   describe an analytical model that captures this anisotropic behavior.
   The analysis approximates the helical wake as a series of vortex rings
   that are allowed to interact with each other. The vorticity in the rings
   is a function of the blade loading. Vortex core growth is modeled by
   accounting for vortex filament strain and by using an empirical model
   for viscous diffusion. The sensitivity of the analysis to the choice of
   initial vortex core radius, viscosity parameter, time step, and number
   of rings shed is explored. Analytical predictions of the orientation of
   anisotropy correlated with experimental measurements within 10\%. The
   analysis can be used as a computationally inexpensive method to generate
   probability distribution functions for vortex core positions that can
   then be used to correct for aperiodicity in measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacteria represent a class of powerful pathogens, including those
   causing tuberculosis and leprosy, which continue to be worldwide health
   challenges. In the last 20 years, an abundance of non-coding, small RNAs

   Naturally, a search in mycobacteria followed, revealing over 200 sRNAs

   correction for quantitative assessment of cerebral blood flow}},
Journal = {{NEUROPHOTONICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Although multiple intraoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) monitoring
   techniques are currently available, a quantitative method that allows
   for continuous monitoring and that can be easily integrated into the
   surgical workflow is still needed. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)
   is an optical imaging technique with a high spatiotemporal resolution
   that has been recently demonstrated as feasible and effective for
   intraoperative monitoring of CBF during neurosurgical procedures. This
   study demonstrates the impact of retrospective motion correction on the
   quantitative analysis of intraoperatively acquired LSCI images. LSCI
   images were acquired through a surgical microscope during brain tumor
   resection procedures from 10 patients under baseline conditions and
   after a cortical stimulation in three of those patients. The patient's
   electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded during acquisition for postprocess
   correction of pulsatile artifacts. Automatic image registration was
   retrospectively performed to correct for tissue motion artifacts, and
   the performance of rigid and nonrigid transformations was compared. In
   baseline cases, the original images had 25\% +/- 27\% noise across 16
   regions of interest (ROIs). ECG filtering moderately reduced the noise
   to 20\% +/- 21\%, while image registration resulted in a further noise
   reduction of 15\% +/- 4\%. Combined ECG filtering and image registration
   significantly reduced the noise to 6.2\% +/- 2.6\% (p < 0.05). Using the
   combined motion correction, accuracy and sensitivity to small changes in
   CBF were improved in cortical stimulation cases. There was also
   excellent agreement between rigid and nonrigid registration methods
   (15/16 ROIs with <3\% difference). Results from this study demonstrate
   the importance of motion correction for improved visualization of CBF
   changes in clinical LSCI images. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE

Abstract = {{In a recent study (Islam et al., 2013) double diffusive natural
   convection of CO2 in brine saturated homogeneous permeable geothermal
   reservoir was investigated. Here we have shown the study of
   heterogeneous reservoirs. Firstly, we present the non-modal stability
   theory to analyze time-dependent double diffusive convection. Linear
   stability analysis is performed and the maximum amplification of
   perturbations optimized over the entire space of initial perturbations
   is examined. These provide us onset time of convection (or the critical
   time) and the structure of the most-amplified perturbations. Secondly,
   we investigate numerical simulation of an anisotropic and layered
   reservoir with permeability variations, which is impervious from the
   sides, and is open to CO2 at the top. We show the propagation of CO2
   plumes over long period of time by analyzing different combination of
   problem parameters: solutal Rayleigh number (100 <= Ras <= 10,000), the
   buoyancy ratio (2 <= N <= 100), Dykstra-Parsons coefficient (0 <= V-dp
   <= 0.85) and a fixed Lewis number. How permeability variation in
   vertical (k(z)) to horizontal (k(x)) direction affects the CO2
   dissolution is discussed for different ratios of k(z)/k(x) (0.1 <=
   k(z)/k(x), <= 0.8). Results of different cavity aspect ratios (0.5 <= A
   <= 2) are also presented. It is found that heterogeneous porous
   reservoir renders better mass transfer of CO2 than the homogeneous one.
   CO2 dissolution is enhanced with increasing both Ras and Vdp. N, which
   represents geothermal effect, has minor impact on overall dissolution
   process. The results have implications in enhanced oil recovery and CO2
   based geothermal systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   with an O(mu(4)) rotational wave model. In contrast, bottom friction is
   included by imposing the frictional coefficient-derived boundary stress
   as an equivalent eddy viscosity. Numerical tests for one horizontal
   dimension show good agreement with regular and irregular wave breaking
   tests, and for solitary wave runup. Surface elevation decay, setup,
   runup, interior orbital velocities, and depth-varying undertow
   velocities can all be modeled reasonably. Comparison with an O(mu(2))
   system shows similar performance for water surface elevations in the
   surf zone, demonstrating that the dissipation model is the major
   controlling factor. However, the O(mu(4)) model shows significantly
   improved representations of the velocity profile in the surf zone, as
   expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of physical properties, including transport and magnetic
   properties, specific heat, and thermal conductivity, have been performed
   on high-quality samples of LaNiO3 and LaCuO3 synthesized under high
   pressure. Some measurements, such as thermoelectric power and magnetic
   susceptibility, have been made under high pressure. The availability of
   a complete set of data enables a side-by-side comparison between these
   two narrowband systems. We have demonstrated unambiguously the mass
   enhancement due to electron-electron correlations in both systems
   relative to the recent density functional theory results. Correlations
   in these narrowband systems also enhance the magnetic susceptibility.
   Ferromagnetic spin fluctuations give rise to a strong Stoner enhancement
   in the magnetic susceptibility in the quarter-filled LaNiO3. Although we
   are able to tune the bandwidth by either chemical substitutions or by
   applying hydrostatic pressure on LaNiO3, the Stoner enhancement does not
   lead to the Stoner instability.}},

Abstract = {{The (110) plane of Co3O4 spinel exhibits significantly higher rates of
   carbon monoxide conversion due to the presence of active Co3+ species at
   the surface. However, experimental studies of Co3O4 (110) surfaces and
   interfaces have been limited by the difficulties in growing high-quality
   films. We report thin (10-250 angstrom) Co3O4 films grown by molecular
   beam epitaxy in the polar (110) direction on MgAl2O4 substrates.
   Reflection high-energy electron diffraction, atomic force microscopy,
   x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy measurements
   attest to the high quality of the as-grown films. Furthermore, we
   investigate the electronic structure of this material by core level and
   valence band x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and first-principles
   density functional theory calculations. Ellipsometry reveals a direct
   band gap of 0.75 eV and other interband transitions at higher energies.
   A valence band offset of 3.2 eV is measured for the Co3O4/MgAl2O4
   heterostructure. Magnetic measurements show the signature of
   antiferromagnetic ordering at 49 K. FTIR ellipsometry finds three

Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{2043-2054}},

Abstract = {{Computational implementation of physical and physiologically realistic
   constitutive models is critical for numerical simulation of soft
   biological tissues in a variety of biomedical applications. It is well
   established that the highly nonlinear and anisotropic mechanical
   behaviors of soft tissues are an emergent behavior of the underlying
   tissue microstructure. In the present study, we have implemented a
   structural constitutive model into a finite element framework
   specialized for membrane tissues. We noted that starting with a single
   element subjected to uniaxial tension, the non-fibrous tissue matrix
   must be present to prevent unrealistic tissue deformations. Flexural
   simulations were used to set the non-fibrous matrix modulus because
   fibers have little effects on tissue deformation under three-point
   bending. Multiple deformation modes were simulated, including strip
   biaxial, planar biaxial with two attachment methods, and membrane
   inflation. Detailed comparisons with experimental data were undertaken
   to insure faithful simulations of both the macro-level stress-strain
   insights into adaptations of the fiber architecture under stress, such
   as fiber reorientation and fiber recruitment. Results indicated a high
   degree of fidelity and demonstrated interesting microstructural
   adaptions to stress and the important role of the underlying tissue
   matrix. Moreover, we apparently resolve a discrepancy in our 1997 study
   (Billiar and Sacks, 1997. J. Biomech. 30 (7), 753-756) where we observed
   that under strip biaxial stretch the simulated fiber splay responses
   were not in good agreement with the experimental results, suggesting
   non-affine deformations may have occurred. However, by correctly
   accounting for the isotropic phase of the measured fiber splay, good
   agreement was obtained. While not the final word, these simulations
   suggest that affine fiber kinematics for planar collagenous tissues is a
   reasonable assumption at the macro level. Simulation tools such as these
   are imperative in the design and simulation of native and engineered
   tissues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of regional tissue stresses in the functioning heart valve
   remains an important goal in our understanding of normal valve function
   and in developing novel engineered tissue strategies for valvular repair
   and replacement. Methods to accurately estimate regional tissue stresses
   are thus needed for this purpose, and in particular to develop accurate,
   statistically informed means to validate computational models of valve
   function. Moreover, there exists no currently accepted method to
   evaluate engineered heart valve tissues and replacement heart valve
   biomaterials undergoing valvular stresses in blood contact. While we
   have utilized mitral valve anterior leaflet valvuloplasty as an
   experimental approach to address this limitation, robust computational
   techniques to estimate implant stresses are required. In the present
   study, we developed a novel numerical analysis approach for estimation
   of the in-vivo stresses of the central region of the mitral valve
   anterior leaflet (MVAL) delimited by a sonocrystal transducer array. The
   in-vivo material properties of the MVAL were simulated using an inverse
   FE modeling approach based on three pseudo-hyperelastic constitutive
   models: the neo-Hookean, exponential-type isotropic, and full collagen
   fiber mapped transversely isotropic models. A series of numerical
   replications with varying structural configurations were developed by
   incorporating measured statistical variations in MVAL local preferred
   fiber directions and fiber splay. These model replications were then
   used to investigate how known variations in the valve tissue
   microstructure influence the estimated ROI stresses and its variation at
   each time point during a cardiac cycle. Simulations were also able to
   include estimates of the variation in tissue stresses for an individual
   specimen dataset over the cardiac cycle. Of the three material models,
   the transversely anisotropic model produced the most accurate results,
   with ROI averaged stresses at the fully-loaded state of 432.6 +/- 46.5
   kPa and 241.4 +/- 40.5 kPa in the radial and circumferential directions,
   respectively. We conclude that the present approach can provide robust
   instantaneous mean and variation estimates of tissue stresses of the
   central regions of the MVAL. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Scattering suppression and wideband tunability of a flexible mantle
   cloak for finite-length conducting rods}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{A simple, thin, flexible mantle cloak for conducting rods based on
   scattering cancellation is analyzed, designed and experimentally
   realized. We show strong scattering suppression at all angles of
   incidence, for both far-field plane-wave and near-field Gaussian
   excitations. The required effective shunt surface impedance is realized
   by a subwavelength patch array, targeting the suppression of the
   dominant omnidirectional scattering contribution of a conductive rod.
   Full-wave simulations predict a total radar cross-section reduction
   better than 14 dB in the lossless case and nearly 8 dB when considering
   a lossy substrate in the cover. Measurements of the realized cloak are
   consistent and validate these numerical predictions. The proposed
   geometry is also shown to be an ideal platform for monolithic
   integration of varactor diodes, allowing real-time tuning of the
   effective surface capacitance of the cloak. We show with numerical
   simulations the possibility of tunable scattering suppression over 1 GHz
   of bandwidth by seamlessly integrating varactor diodes in our mantle
   cloak design.}},

Abstract = {{Sr0.7Ho0.3CoO3-delta oxide has been recently described as an excellent
   cathode material (1274 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C with pure H-2 as
   fuel(1)) for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with LSGM as electrolyte. In
   this work, we describe a detailed study of its crystal structure
   conducted to find out the correlation between the excellent performance
   as a cathode and the structural features. The tetragonal crystal
   structure (e.g., I4/mmm) basically contains layers of octahedrally
   coordinated Co2O(6) units alternated with layers of ColO(4) tetrahedra
   sharing corners. An ``in situ{''} neutron power diffraction (NPD)
   experiment, between 25 and 800 degrees C, reveals the presence of a high
   oxygen deficiency affecting O4 oxygen atoms, with large displacement
   factors that suggest a large lability and mobility. Difference Fourier
   maps allow the visualization at high temperatures of the 2D diffusion
   pathways within the tetrahedral layers, where O3 and O4 oxygens
   participate. The measured thermal expansion coefficient is 16.61 x
   10(-6) K-1 between 300 and 850 degrees C, exhibiting an excellent
   chemical compatibility with the electrolyte.}},

Abstract = {{Interfacial adhesion between graphene and a SiO2 substrate is studied by
   density functional theory (DFT) with dispersion corrections. The results
   demonstrate the van der Waals (vdW) interaction as the predominant
   mechanism at the graphene/SiO2 interface. It is found that the
   interaction strength is strongly influenced by changes of the SiO2
   surface structures due to surface reactions with water. The adhesion
   energy is reduced when the reconstructed SiO2 surface is hydroxylated,
   and further reduced when covered by a monolayer of adsorbed water
   molecules. Moreover, it is noted that vdW forces are required to
   accurately model the graphene/SiO2 interface with DFT and that the
   adhesion energy is underestimated by empirical force fields commonly

Abstract = {{The theoretical capacity of LiVOPO4 could be increased from 159 to 318
   mAh/g with the insertion of a second Li+ ion into the lattice to form
   Li2VOPO4, significantly enhancing the energy density of lithium-ion
   batteries. The phase changes accompanying the second Li+ insertion into
   alpha-LiVOPO4 and beta-LiVOPO4 are presented here at various degrees of
   lithiation, employing both electrochemical and chemical lithiation.
   Inductively coupled plasma, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy measurements indicate that a composition
   of Li2VOPO4 can be realized with an oxidation state of V3+ by the
   chemical lithiation process. The accompanying structural changes are
   evidenced by X-ray and neutron powder diffraction. Spectroscopic and
   diffraction data collected with the chemically lithiated samples as well
   as diffraction data on the electrochemically lithiated samples reveal
   that a significant amount of lithium can be inserted into alpha-LiVOPO4
   before a phase change occurs. In contrast, lithiation of beta-LiVOPO4 is
   more consistent with the formation of a two-phase mixture throughout
   most of the lithiation range. The phases observed with the
   ambient-temperature lithiation processes presented here are
   significantly different from those reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events are
   worrisome complications of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation
   (AF). The periprocedural anticoagulation management could play a role in
   the incidence of these complications. Although ablation procedures
   performed without warfarin discontinuation seem to be associated with
   lower thromboembolic risk, no randomized study exists.
   Methods and Results-This was a prospective, open-label, randomized,
   parallel-group, multicenter study assessing the role of continuous
   warfarin therapy in preventing periprocedural thromboembolic and
   hemorrhagic events after radiofrequency catheter ablation. Patients with
   CHADS(2) score >= 1 were included. Patients were randomly assigned in a
   1:1 ratio to the off-warfarin or on-warfarin arm. The incidence of
   thromboembolic events in the 48 hours after ablation was the primary end
   point of the study. The study enrolled 1584 patients:790 assigned to
   discontinue warfarin (group 1) and 794 assigned to continuous warfarin
   (group 2). No statistical difference in baseline characteristics was
   observed. There were 39 thromboembolic events (3.7\% strokes {[}n=29]
   and 1.3\% transient ischemic attacks {[}n=10]) in group 1:two events
   (0.87\%) in patients with paroxysmal AF, 4 (2.3\%) in patients with
   persistent AF, and 33 (8.5\%) in patients with long-standing persistent
   AF. Only 2 strokes (0.25\%) in patients with long-standing persistent AF
   were observed in group 2 (P<0.001). Warfarin discontinuation emerged as
   a strong predictor of periprocedural thromboembolism (odds ratio, 13;
   95\% confidence interval, 3.1-55.6; P<0.001).
   Conclusion-This is the first randomized study showing that performing
   catheter ablation of AF without warfarin discontinuation reduces the
   occurrence of periprocedural stroke and minor bleeding complications
   compared with bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin.}},

Title = {{What does scalar timing tell us about neural dynamics?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{The ``Scalar Timing Law,{''} which is a temporal domain generalization
   of the well known Weber Law, states that the errors estimating temporal
   intervals scale linearly with the durations of the intervals. Linear
   scaling has been studied extensively in human and animal models and
   holds over several orders of magnitude, though to date there is no
   agreed upon explanation for its physiological basis. Starting from the
   assumption that behavioral variability stems from neural variability,
   this work shows how to derive firing rate functions that are consistent
   with scalar timing. We show that firing rate functions with a log-power
   form, and a set of parameters that depend on spike count statistics, can
   account for scalar timing. Our derivation depends on a linear
   approximation, but we use simulations to validate the theory and show
   that log-power firing rate functions result in scalar timing over a
   large range of times and parameters. Simulation results match the
   predictions of our model, though our initial formulation results in a
   slight bias toward overestimation that can be corrected using a simple
   iterative approach to learn a decision threshold}},

Abstract = {{The charge distribution of halogen atoms on organochlorine compounds can
   be highly anisotropic and even display a so-called sigma-hole, which
   leads to strong halogen bonds with electron donors. In this paper, we
   have systematically investigated a series of chloromethanes with one to
   four chloro substituents using a polarizable multipole-based molecular
   mechanics model. The atomic multipoles accurately reproduced the ab
   initio electrostatic potential around chloromethanes, including CCl4,
   which has a prominent sigma-hole on the Cl atom. The van der Waals
   parameters for Cl were fitted to the experimental density and heat of
   vaporization. The calculated hydration free energy, solvent reaction
   fields, and interaction energies of several homo- and heterodimer of
   chloromethanes are in good agreement with experimental and ab initio
   data. This study suggests that sophisticated electrostatic models, such
   as polarizable atomic multipoles, are needed for accurate description of
   electrostatics in organochlorine compounds and halogen bonds, although
   further improvement is necessary for better transferability.}},

Pages = {{8708-8713}},

Abstract = {{Protein chains undergo conformational diffusion during folding and
   dynamics, experiencing both thermal kicks and viscous drag. Recent
   experiments have shown that the corresponding friction can be separated
   into wet friction, which is determined by the solvent viscosity, and dry
   friction, where frictional effects arise due to the interactions within
   the protein chain. Despite important advances, the molecular origins
   underlying dry friction in proteins have remained unclear. To address
   this problem, we studied the dynamics of the unfolded cold-shock protein
   at different solvent viscosities and denaturant concentrations. Using
   extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations we estimated the
   internal friction time scales and found them to agree well with the
   corresponding experimental measurements (Soranno et al. Proc. Natl.
   Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012, 109, 17800-17806). Analysis of the
   reconfiguration dynamics of the unfolded chain further revealed that
   hops in the dihedral space provide the dominant mechanism of internal
   friction. Furthermore, the increased number of concerted dihedral moves
   at physiological conditions suggest that, in such conditions, the
   concerted motions result in higher frictional forces. These findings
   have important implications for understanding the folding kinetics of
   proteins as well as the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins.}},

Title = {{The Impact of Water Use Fees on Dispatching and Water Requirements for
   Water-Cooled Power Plants in Texas}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{7128-7134}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{We utilize a unit commitment and dispatch model to estimate how water
   use fees on power generators would affect dispatching and water
   requirements by the power sector in the Electric Reliability Council of
   Texas' (ERCOT) electric grid. Fees ranging from 10 to 1000 USD per
   acre-foot were separately applied to water withdrawals and consumption.
   Fees were chosen to be comparable in cost to a range of water supply
   projects proposed in the Texas Water Development Board's State Water
   Plan to meet demand through 2050. We found that these fees can reduce
   water withdrawals and consumption for cooling thermoelectric power
   plants in ERCOT by as much as 75\% and 23\%, respectively. To achieve
   these water savings, wholesale electricity generation costs might
   increase as much as 120\% based on 2011 fuel costs and generation
   characteristics. We estimate that water saved through these fees is not
   as cost-effective as conventional long-term water supply projects.
   However, the electric grid offers short-term flexibility that
   conventional water supply projects do not. Furthermore, this manuscript
   discusses conditions under which the grid could be effective at
   ``supplying{''} water, particularly during emergency drought conditions,
   by changing its operational conditions.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{We propose a comprehensive scheme for the efficient design of graded
   optical metasurfaces capable of rerouting the impinging energy at will
   in a flexible way. We show that carefully designed conjoined optical
   nanoelements may be used as basic building blocks to arbitrarily shape
   the reflected phase front, while providing large controllability and low
   loss over deeply subwavelength thicknesses. The metasurface elements are
   designed using transmission line concepts combined with nanocircuit
   theory, and they can be realized with conventional lithographic
   techniques. Based on these concepts, we put forward a fast and accurate
   analytical model to design the optical analog of reflectarrays for light
   bending, steering, and focusing. The proposed designs show large
   efficiency over a broad angular spectrum, accompanied by broad
   bandwidths of operation. Our technique may lead to significant advances
   in the field of planarized nanophotonics and light manipulation over a
   surface, with potential applications in light trapping and efficient
   photonic couplers.}},

Title = {{Solute and water transport in forward osmosis using polydopamine
   modified thin film composite membranes}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{343}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{8-16}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{Forward osmosis is a rapidly emerging technology that has potential to
   enable low cost water treatment and desalination. Previous
   investigations have found that reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were
   unsuitable for forward osmosis in part due to their hydrophobic support
   layers, which inhibit wetting. Poor wetting hinders water and solute
   transport in the support layer, dramatically increasing the severity of
   internal concentration polarization. In this study, RO membrane support
   layers were modified with polydopamine (PDA) to increase their
   hydrophilicity and promote wetting. The results indicate that the
   modified RO membranes exhibited a four to six fold increase in forward
   osmosis (FO) water flux under test conditions relative to unmodified
   membranes. Additional tests were performed under model desalination
   conditions using an ammonia-carbon dioxide draw solution with a sodium
   chloride feed. The sodium and chloride rejections were measured
   independently and in some instances substantial differences were
   observed. Additionally sodium and chloride rejections were lower than
   anticipated with a peak rejection of 90\%. The substantial difference
   between sodium and chloride rejections was attributed to a cationic
   exchange effect between the draw and feed solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Strontium titanate, SrTiO3 (STO), thin films incorporated with lanthanum
   are grown on Si (001) substrates at a thickness range of 5-25 nm. Atomic
   layer deposition (ALD) is used to grow the LaxSr1-xTiO3 (La: STO) films
   after buffering the Si (001) substrate with four-unit-cells of STO
   deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. The crystalline structure and
   orientation of the La: STO films are confirmed via reflection
   high-energy electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and cross-sectional
   transmission electron microscopy. The low temperature ALD growth
   (similar to 225 degrees C) and post-deposition annealing at 550 degrees
   C for 5 min maintains an abrupt interface between Si (001) and the
   crystalline oxide. Higher annealing temperatures (650 degrees C) show
   more complete La activation with film resistivities of similar to 2.0 x
   10(-2) Omega cm for 20-nm-thick La: STO (x similar to 0.15); however,
   the STO-Si interface is slightly degraded due to the increased annealing
   temperature. To demonstrate the selective incorporation of lanthanum by
   ALD, a layered heterostructure is grown with an undoped STO layer
   sandwiched between two conductive La: STO layers. Based on this work, an
   epitaxial oxide stack centered on La: STO and BaTiO3 integrated with Si
   is envisioned as a material candidate for a ferroelectric field-effect

Abstract = {{We present a series of perovskite electrocatalysts that are highly
   active for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction
   reaction (ORR) in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Lanthanum-based
   perovskites containing different transition metal active sites (LaBO3, B
   = Ni, Ni0.75Fe0.25, Co, Mn) are synthesized by a general colloidal
   method, yielding phase pure catalysts of homogeneous morphology and
   surface area (8-14 m(2)/g). Each perovskite's ability to catalyze the
   OER and ORR is examined using thin film rotating disk electrochemistry
   (RDE). LaCoO3 supported on nitrogen-doped carbon is shown to be similar
   to 3 times more active for the OER than high-surface-area IrO2.
   Furthermore, LaCoO3 is demonstrated to be highly bifunctional by having
   a lower total overpotential between the OER and ORR (Delta E = 1.00 V)
   than Pt (Delta E = 1.16) and Ru (Delta E = 1.01). The OER and ORR
   pathways are perturbed by the introduction of peroxide
   disproportionation functionality via support interactions and selective
   doping of the catalyst. LaNi0.75Fe0.25O3's ability to disproportionate
   peroxide is hypothesized to be responsible for the similar to 50\%
   improvement over LaNiO3 in catalytic activity toward the ORR, despite
   similar electronic structure. These results allow us to examine the
   pathways for OER and ORR in context of support interactions, transition
   metal redox processes, and catalytic bifunctionality.}},

Title = {{Correlations between formation properties and induced seismicity during
   high pressure injection into granitic rock}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{175}},
Pages = {{74-80}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{We reviewed published results from six projects where hydraulic
   stimulation was performed in granitic rock. At each project, fractures
   in the formation were well-oriented to slip at the injection pressures
   used during stimulation. In all but one case, thousands of cubic meters
   of water were injected, and in every case, flow rates on the order of
   tens of liters per second were used. Despite these similarities, there
   was a large variation in the severity of induced seismicity that
   occurred in response to injection. At the three projects where induced
   seismicity was significant, observations at the wellbore showed evidence
   of well-developed brittle fault zones. At the three projects where
   induced seismicity was less significant, observations at the wellbore
   indicated only crack-like features and did not suggest significant fault
   development. These results suggest that assessments of the degree of
   fault development at the wellbore may be useful for predicting induced
   seismicity hazard. We cannot rule out that the differences were caused
   by variations in frictional properties that were unrelated to the degree
   of fault development (and it is possible that there is a relationship
   between these two parameters). The projects with more significant
   seismicity tended to be deeper, and if this is a meaningful correlation,
   it is unclear whether depth influenced seismic hazard through the degree
   of fault development, frictional properties, or some other variable. The
   results of this paper are not conclusive, but they suggest that there
   may be significant opportunity for future research on identifying
   geological conditions that increase induced seismicity hazard. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In a room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery, the complicated
   reduction reaction of the sulfur cathode generally involves two main
   steps: (i) transformation of elemental sulfur into long-chain soluble
   sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn 4 <= n <= 8) and (ii) conversion of the
   long-chain sodium polysulfides into solid-state short-chain polysulfide
   Na2S2 or disulfide Na2S. It is found that the slow kinetics of the
   second step limits the efficiency of discharge and induces irreversible
   capacity loss during cycling. Accordingly, we present here a RT Na-S
   cell operated with the sulfur/long-chain sodium polysulfide redox couple
   to avoid the capacity fade. An advanced cathode structure has been
   developed by inserting a carbon nanofoam interlayer between the sulfur
   cathode and the separator to localize the soluble polysulfide species
   and prevent its migration to the anode. The highly reversible
   sulfur/long-chain sodium polysulfide cell presented here can provide a
   stable output energy density of 450 Wh kg(-1) at an extremely low energy
   cost of -\$10 kWh(-1) (based on the active material of anode and
   cathode).}},

   access to the electrolyte through the porous network of MWCNT along with
   its fast electronic transport facilitates the reutilization of the
   trapped active material and superior long-term cyclability. The
   MVVCNT-coating is lightweight (0.17 mg cm(-2)), yet allows the
   successful use of regular sulfur cathodes (high sulfur content of 70 wt

Abstract = {{It is of critical importance to improve toughness, strength, and
   wear-resistance together for the development of advanced structural
   materials. Herein, we report on the synthesis of unoxidized
   graphene/alumina composite materials having enhanced toughness,
   strength, and wear-resistance by a low-cost and environmentally benign
   pressure-less-sintering process. The wear resistance of the composites
   was increased by one order of magnitude even under high normal load
   condition (25 N) as a result of a tribological effect of graphene along
   with enhanced fracture toughness (K-IC) and flexural strength (sigma(f))
   of the composites by similar to 75\% (5.60 MPa.m(1/2)) and similar to
   25\% (430 MPa), respectively, compared with those of pure Al2O3.
   Furthermore, we found that only a small fraction of ultra-thin graphene
   (0.25-0.5 vol\%, platelet thickness of 2-5 nm) was enough to reinforce
   the composite. In contrast to unoxidized graphene, graphene oxide (G-O)
   and reduced graphene oxide (rG-O) showed little or less enhancement of
   fracture toughness due to the degraded mechanical strength of rG-O and
   the structural defects of the G-O composites.}},

Abstract = {{Household air pollution from solid fuel combustion is the leading
   environmental health risk factor globally. In China, almost half of all
   homes use solid fuel to meet their household energy demands. Gasifier
   cookstoves offer a potentially affordable, efficient, and low-polluting
   alternative to current solid fuel combustion technology, but pollutant
   emissions and energy efficiency performance of this class of stoves are
   poorly characterized. In this study, four Chinese gasifier cookstoves
   were evaluated for their pollutant emissions and efficiency using the
   internationally recognized water boiling test (WBT), version 4.1.2. WBT
   performance indicators included PM2.5, CO, and CO2 emissions and overall
   thermal efficiency. Laboratory investigation also included evaluation of
   pollutant emissions (PM2.5 and CO) under stove operating conditions
   designed to simulate common Chinese cooking practices. High power
   average overall thermal efficiencies ranged from 22 to 33\%. High power
   average PM2.5 emissions ranged from 120 to 430 mg/MJ of useful energy,
   and CO emissions ranged from 1 to 30 g/MJ of useful energy. Compared
   with several widely disseminated ``improved{''} cookstoves selected from
   the literature, on average, the four Chinese gasifier cookstoves had
   lower PM2.5 emissions and higher CO emissions. The recent International
   Organization for Standardization (ISO) International Workshop Agreement
   on tiered cookstove ranking was developed to help classify stove
   performance and identify the best-performing stoves. The results from
   this study highlight potential ways to further improve this approach.
   Medium power stove operation emitted nearly twice as much PM2.5 as was
   emitted during high power stove operation, and the lighting phase of a
   cooking event contributed 45\% and 34\% of total PM2.5 emissions
   (combined lighting and cooking). Future approaches to laboratory-based
   testing of advanced cookstoves could improve to include greater
   differentiation between different modes of stove operation, beyond those
   evaluated with the WBT.}},

Title = {{Clustering Partially Observed Graphs via Convex Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{2213-2238}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of clustering a partially observed
   unweighted graph i.e., one where for some node pairs we know there is an
   edge between them, for some others we know there is no edge, and for the
   remaining we do not know whether or not there is an edge. We want to
   organize the nodes into disjoint clusters so that there is relatively
   dense (observed) connectivity within clusters, and sparse across
   clusters.
   We take a novel yet natural approach to this problem, by focusing on
   finding the clustering that minimizes the number of ``disagreements{''}
   i.e., the sum of the number of (observed) missing edges within clusters,
   and (observed) present edges across clusters. Our algorithm uses convex
   optimization; its basis is a reduction of disagreement minimization to
   the problem of recovering an (unknown) low-rank matrix and an (unknown)
   sparse matrix from their partially observed sum. We evaluate the
   performance of our algorithm on the classical Planted
   Partition/Stochastic Block Model. Our main theorem provides sufficient
   conditions for the success of our algorithm as a function of the minimum
   cluster size, edge density and observation probability; in particular,
   the results characterize the tradeoff between the observation
   probability and the edge density gap. When there are a constant number
   of clusters of equal size, our results are optimal up to logarithmic
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Conjugation of multiple nanomaterials has become the focus of recent
   materials development. This new material class is commonly known as
   nanohybrids or ``horizon nanomaterials{''}. Conjugation of metal/metal
   oxides with carbonaceous nanomaterials and overcoating or doping of one
   metal with another have been pursued to enhance material performance
   and/or incorporate multifunctionality into nano-enabled devices and
   processes. Nanohybrids are already at use in commercialized energy,
   electronics and medical products, which warrant immediate attention for
   their safety evaluation. These conjugated ensembles likely present a new
   set of physicochemical properties that are unique to their individual
   component attributes, hence increasing uncertainty in their risk
   evaluation. Established toxicological testing strategies and enumerated
   underlying mechanisms will thus need to be re-evaluated for the
   assessment of these horizon materials. This review will present a
   critical discussion on the altered physicochemical properties of
   nanohybrids and analyze the validity of existing nanotoxicology data
   against these unique properties. The article will also propose
   strategies to evaluate the conjugate materials' safety to help undertake

Abstract = {{Pore velocity-dependent dynamic contact angles provide a mechanism for
   explaining the formation of fingers/columns in porous media. To study
   those dynamic contact angles when gravity is present, rectangular
   capillary tubes were used to facilitate observation of the complete

   (1975) relationship between dynamic contact angle and water velocity
   applies to gravity-affected flow fields, and that it (when adjusted for
   nonzero static contact angles) can be used to model dynamic capillary
   pressures for unstable wettings fronts in porous media by assuming that
   (1) pressure at the wetting front is discontinuous, (2) the flow field
   behind the fingertip is highly heterogeneous, and (3) the front line
   advances one or a few pores at the time. We demonstrate the utility of
   the Hoffman relationship for porous media with a published infiltration
   experiment by calculating the capillary pressure successfully at the
   unstable wetting front as a function of the flux of water in the finger
   and the grain size diameter.}},

Abstract = {{In applications of polymer flood for enhanced oil recovery (EOR),
   polymer injectivity is of great concern because project economics is
   sensitive to injection rates. In-situ non-Newtonian polymer rheology is
   the most crucial factor that affects polymer injectivity. There are
   several ongoing polymer-injection field tests in which the field
   injectivities differ significantly from the simulation forecasts. We
   have developed an analytical model to more accurately calculate and
   predict polymer injectivity during the field projects to help with
   optimum injection strategies.
   Significant viscosity variations during polymer flood occur in the
   vicinities of wellbores where velocities are high. As the size of a
   wellblock increases, velocity smears, and thus polymer injectivity is
   erroneously calculated. In the University of Texas Chemical Flooding
   Simulator (UTCHEM), the solution was to use an effective radius to
   capture the ``grid effect,{''} which is empirical and impractical for
   large-scale field simulations with several hundred wells. Another
   approach is to use local grid refinement near wells, but this adds to
   the computational cost and limits the size of the problem. An attractive
   alternative to previous approaches is to extend the Peaceman well model
   (Peaceman 1983) to non-Newtonian polymer solutions.
   The polymer rheological model and its implementation in UTCHEM were
   validated by simulating single-phase polymer injectivity in coreflood
   experiments. On the basis of the Peaceman well model and UTCHEM polymer
   rheological models covering both shear-thinning and shear-thickening
   polymers, an analytical polymer-injectivity model was developed. The
   analytical model was validated by comparing results of different
   gridblock sizes and radial numerical simulation. We also tested a field

Title = {{Rapid Updating of Stochastic Models by Use of an Ensemble-Filter
   Approach}},

Abstract = {{Applying an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is an effective method for
   reservoir history matching. The underlying principle is that an initial
   ensemble of stochastic models can be progressively updated to reflect
   measured values as they become available. The EnKF performance is only
   optimal, however, if the prior-state vector is linearly related to the
   predicted data and if the joint distribution of the prior-state vector
   is multivariate Gaussian. Therefore, it is challenging to implement the
   filtering scheme for non-Gaussian random fields, such as channelized
   reservoirs, in which the continuity of permeability extremes is
   well-preserved. In this paper, we develop a methodology by combining
   model classification with multidimensional scaling (MDS) and the EnKF to
   create rapidly updating models of a channelized reservoir. A
   dissimilarity matrix is computed by use of the dynamic responses of
   ensemble members. This dissimilarity matrix is transformed into a
   lower-dimensional space by use of MDS. Responses mapped in the
   lower-dimension space are clustered, and on the basis of the distances
   between the models in a cluster and the actual observed response, the
   closest models to the observed response are retrieved. Model updates
   within the closest cluster are performed with EnKF equations. The
   results of an update are used to resample new models for the next step.
   Two-dimensional, waterflooding examples of channelized reservoirs are
   provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. The
   obtained results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is viable both
   for sequentially updating reservoir models and for preserving channel
   features after the data-assimilation process.}},

Abstract = {{Attracted by the unique tissue and functions of leaves, a natural
   carbonized leaf (CL) is presented as a polysulfide diffusion inhibitor
   in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The CL that is covered on the pure
   sulfur cathode effectively suppresses the polysulfide shuttling
   mechanism and enables the use of pure sulfur as the cathode. A low
   charge resistance and a high discharge capacity of 1320mAhg(-1) arise
   from the improved cell conductivity due to the innately integral
   conductive carbon network of the CL. The unique microstructure of CL
   leads to a high discharge/charge efficiency of >98\%, low capacity fade
   of 0.18\% per cycle, and good long-term cyclability over 150cycles. The
   structural gradient and the micro/mesoporous adsorption sites of CL
   effectively intercept/trap the migrating polysulfides and facilitate
   their reutilization. The green CL polysulfide diffusion inhibitor thus
   offers a viable approach for developing high-performance lithium-sulfur

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Methods for improving microbial strains for metabolite production remain
   the subject of constant research. Traditionally, metabolic tuning has
   been mostly limited to knockouts or overexpression of pathway genes and
   regulators. In this paper, we establish a new method to control
   metabolism by inducing optimally tuned time-oscillations in the levels
   of selected clusters of enzymes, as an alternative strategy to increase
   the production of a desired metabolite. Using an established kinetic
   model of the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli, we formulate
   this concept as a dynamic optimization problem over an extended, but
   finite time horizon. Total production of a metabolite of interest (in
   this case, phosphoenolpyruvate, PEP) is established as the objective
   function and time-varying concentrations of the cellular enzymes are
   used as decision variables. We observe that by varying, in an optimal
   fashion, levels of key enzymes in time, PEP production increases
   significantly compared to the unoptimized system. We demonstrate that
   oscillations can improve metabolic output in experimentally feasible
   synthetic circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Residential and commercial buildings account for a significant portion
   of the electricity consumed in the United States. Their operation is
   subject to fluctuations in weather and occupancy which, in turn, are
   reflected in large variations in the load that buildings impose on the
   grid during the day and at night time. In view of mitigating such
   fluctuations (and their broader impact on energy generation),
   understanding the dynamic behavior of buildings and a focus on energy
   management (rather than simply temperature control), is essential. In
   this paper, we begin by analyzing building dynamics and use singular
   perturbation arguments to provide a theoretical justification for the
   empirically acknowledged multiple time scale dynamic response of
   buildings. We also derive reduced-order models for the dynamics in each
   time scale for a prototype residential building. Our analysis accounts
   for the potential use of heat recovery ventilators (HRVs), and we show
   that the presence of energy recovery leads to the emergence of a dynamic
   behavior with three time scales, including an overall, system-wide
   component which involves both the building and the HVAC system. We use
   our dynamic results to formulate a set of synthesis guidelines for
   control systems addressing either temperature regulation or geared
   towards minimizing operating cost. A detailed simulation case study
   demonstrates the application of the derived reduced-order models in the
   design of a nonlinear predictive model-based optimal energy management
   strategy for a model of a single-zone test building situated on the
   University of Texas campus. The proposed controller exhibits excellent
   performance, can easily be executed in real-time and has the capability
   to shift peak loads as part of a demand flattening strategy. (C) 2013

Title = {{CO2-EOR and storage design optimization}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{79-92}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A partnership between oilfield operators and the federal government in
   the coupled CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and storage projects may
   bring long-term benefits for both.
   This paper describes the field-scale design optimization of coupled
   CO2-EOR and storage operations from the viewpoint of oilfield operators.
   We introduce two categories of EOR-storage design optimization problems:
   the fixed storage requirement and integrated asset optimization. The
   first problem follows an environmental-driven objective by giving
   priority to the storage element of CO2-EOR and storage; the second
   prioritizes the oil recovery to the storage and adjusts the storage
   volume commitment based on the economic benefits. Each problem is
   elaborated through a set of common but specific technical and economic
   assumptions, which are mainly based on the USA circumstances.
   The results quantitatively describe the relations between the design
   parameters, reservoir properties, asset size, and the economic
   parameters. With appropriate economic conditions and fiscal incentives,
   specifically in the form of storage tax credit, coupled CO2-EOR and
   storage could be attractive for both the oilfield operators and the
   government. In addition, CO2-EOR and storage is not the ultimate
   solution to the industrial-scale CO2 storage requirements. A medium-size
   industrial capture and storage for 25 years through EOR requires an
   asset size greater than the current field-scale EOR operations in the
   USA. Finally, the reservoir properties significantly affect the economic
   benefits for both the oilfield operators and the government. The
   proposed workflow may serve as a screening tool to rank the EOR-storage
   candidates and prioritize the most promising prospects for both the
   oilfield operators and the government. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Channel idle time distribution based secondary transmission strategies
   have been studied intensively in the literature. Under various
   performance metrics, the ultimate performance of secondary devices are
   eventually dictated by the presumed channel idle time distribution. Such
   distributions can take any arbitrary form in practice. In this work, we
   study idle time distributions in wireless local area networks (WLAN)
   using large amount of the channel idle time data collected in real-world
   WLAN networks. We demonstrate with experimental data that the channel
   idle time distribution can be closely modeled by hyper-exponential
   distribution. Furthermore, one can treat the primary packet arrival
   process as a semi-Markov modulated Poisson process. Several secondary
   transmission strategies are discussed under this model. It is shown that
   using only one hyper-exponential distribution, the secondary user can
   achieve a desirable performance when the primary packet arrival process
   is stationary. However, experimental data suggests that in practice,
   this process is not stationary and the secondary user can experience a
   large performance loss with stationary transmission strategy. We propose
   a novel transmission strategy that achieves suboptimal secondary user
   performance when the idle time distribution is not stationary. The
   performances of secondary transmission strategies are demonstrated using
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of carbon-coated Li3Nd3W2O12 (C-Li3Nd3W2O12), a low
   voltage insertion anode (0.3 V vs. Li) for a Li-ion battery, is reported
   to exhibit extraordinary performance. The low voltage reversible
   insertion provides an increase in the energy density of Li-ion power
   packs. For instance, C-Li3Nd3W2O12 delivered an energy density of
   approximate to 390 Wh kg(-1) (based on cathode mass loading) when
   coupled with an LiMn2O4 cathode with an operating potential of 3.4 V.
   Furthermore, excellent cycling profiles are observed for C-Li3Nd3W2O12
   anodes both in half and full-cell configurations. The full-cell is
   capable of delivering very stable cycling profiles at high current rates

Abstract = {{By examining how a defect within a crystalline material responds to
   small changes in its charge state, the electronic properties of an
   ionized defect can be modeled by an effective work function and
   capacitance. Such an approach leads to a correction formula to the total
   energy of a charged periodic system and allows a comparison between the
   electronic band structure of the ionized defect to its corresponding
   neutral one. The correction formula can be related to the potential
   alignment method and Makov-Payne correction widely adopted in charged
   periodic systems. The new approach suggests both an alternative
   interpretation and improvements to the popular Makov-Payne and potential
   alignment scheme. P-doped Si, which has a shallow donor level, and an
   isolated vacancy in crystalline Si, which has a deep defect level within
   the Si energy gap, are chosen as prototypical systems to demonstrate our
   method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of Grafted Copolymer Composition on Iron Oxide Nanoparticle

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The transport of engineered nanoparticles in porous media is of interest
   in numerous applications including electromagnetic imaging of subsurface
   reservoirs, enhanced oil recovery, and CO2 sequestration. A series of
   poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid-co-acrylic acid)
   (poly(AMPS-co-AA)) random copolymers were grafted onto iron oxide (IO)
   nanoparticles (NPs) to provide colloidal stability in American Petroleum
   Institute (API) standard brine (8 wt/wt \% NaCl and 2 wt/wt \%CaCl2,
   anhydrous basis). A combinatorial approach, which employed grafting
   poly(AMPS-co-AA) with wide ranges of compositions onto platform
   amine-functionalized 10 NPs via a
   1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-carbondiimidecarbondiimide (EDC)
   catalyzed amidation, was used to screen a large number of polymeric
   coatings. The ratio of AMPS/AA was varied from 1:1 to 20:1 to balance
   the requirements of particle stabilization, low adsorption/retention
   (provided by 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS)), and
   permanent attachment of stabilizer (provided by acrylic acid (AA)). The
   resulting nanoparticles remained stable in aqueous suspension despite
   the extremely high salinity conditions and exhibited low adsorption on
   silica microspheres. Greater than 91\% of applied IO-NP mass was
   transported through columns packed quartz sand, and the mobility of IO
   NP increased by ca. 6\% when the AMPS to AA ratio was increased from 1:1
   to 3:1, consistent with batch adsorption data. In both static batch
   reactor and dynamic column tests, the observed attachment of IO NPs was
   attributed to divalent cation (Ca2+) mediated bridging and hydrophobic
   interactions. Collectively, the rapid, high throughput combinatorial
   approach of grafting and screening (via batch adsorption) provides for
   the development of high mobility NPs for delivery in various porous
   media under high salinity conditions.}},

Title = {{3D Visual Discomfort Prediction: Vergence, Foveation, and the

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To achieve clear binocular vision, neural processes that accomplish
   accommodation and vergence are performed via two collaborative,
   cross-coupled processes: accommodation-vergence (AV) and
   vergence-accommodation (VA). However, when people watch stereo images on
   stereoscopic displays, normal neural functioning may be disturbed owing
   to anomalies of the cross-link gains. These anomalies are likely the
   main cause of visual discomfort experienced when viewing stereo images,
   and are called Accommodation-Vergence Mismatches (AVM). Moreover, the
   absence of any useful accommodation depth cues when viewing 3D content
   on a flat panel (planar) display induces anomalous demands on binocular
   fusion, resulting in possible additional visual discomfort. Most prior
   efforts in this direction have focused on predicting anomalies in the AV
   cross-link using measurements on a computed disparity map. We further
   these contributions by developing a model that accounts for both
   accommodation and vergence, resulting in a new visual discomfort
   prediction algorithm dubbed the 3D-AVM Predictor. The 3D-AVM model and
   algorithm make use of a new concept we call local 3D bandwidth (BW)
   which is defined in terms of the physiological optics of binocular
   vision and foveation. The 3D-AVM Predictor accounts for anomalous motor
   responses of both accommodation and vergence, yielding predictive power
   that is statistically superior to prior models that rely on a computed
   disparity distribution only.}},

Abstract = {{For security, environmental, and regulatory purposes it is useful to

   monitoring. We adapt previously-developed anomaly detection methods,
   which compare spectral shape rather than count rate, to function with
   limited background data, allowing sensitive detection of small changes
   in spectral shape from day to day. To demonstrate this technique we
   collected daily observations over the period of six weeks on a 0.33

Title = {{On cumulative nonlinear acoustic waveform distortions from high-speed
   jets}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{749}},
Pages = {{331-366}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A model is proposed for predicting the presence of cumulative nonlinear
   distortions in the acoustic waveforms produced by high-speed jet flows.
   The model relies on the conventional definition of the acoustic shock
   formation distance and employs an effective Gol'dberg number A for
   diverging acoustic waves. The latter properly accounts for spherical
   spreading, whereas the classical Gol'dberg number F is restricted to
   plane wave applications. Scaling laws are then derived to account for
   the effects imposed by jet exit conditions of practical interest and
   includes Mach number, temperature ratio, Strouhal number and an absolute
   observer distance relative to a broadband Gaussian source. Surveys of
   the acoustic pressure produced by a laboratory-scale, shock-free and
   unheated Mach 3 jet are used to support findings of the model. Acoustic
   waveforms are acquired on a two-dimensional grid extending out to 145
   nozzle diameters from the jet exit plane. Various statistical metrics
   are employed to examine the degree of local and cumulative nonlinearity
   in the measured waveforms and their temporal derivatives. This includes
   a wave steepening factor (WSF), skewness, kurtosis and the normalized
   quadrature spectral density. The analysed data are shown to collapse
   reasonably well along rays emanating from the post-potential-core region
   of the jet. An application of the generalized Burgers equation is used
   to demonstrate the effect of cumulative nonlinear distortion on an
   arbitrary acoustic waveform produced by a high-convective-Mach-number
   supersonic jet. It is advocated that cumulative nonlinear distortion
   effects during far-field sound propagation are too subtle in this
   range-restricted environment and over the region covered, which may be
   true for other laboratory-scale jet noise facilities.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of a buckled beam mechanism, which exhibits both
   bistability and negative stiffness, is investigated for the purposes of
   passive shock and vibration isolation. The vibration and shock isolation
   systems investigated in this research include linear, positive stiffness
   springs in parallel with the transverse motion of buckled beams,
   resulting in quasizero stiffness behavior. For vibration isolation
   systems, quasizero stiffness lowers the resonance frequency of the
   system, thereby reducing its transmissibility at frequencies greater
   than resonance. For shock isolation systems, quasizero stiffness
   provides constant-force shock isolation at tailored force levels,
   thereby enabling increased capacity for absorbing shock energy relative
   to a comparable positive stiffness system. Single-and double-beam
   configurations that exhibit first-mode buckling are utilized for
   vibration isolation, and a single beam that exhibits first-and
   third-mode buckling is used for shock isolation. For all cases, the
   static and dynamic behavior of each configuration is modeled
   analytically. The models are then used to design prototype vibration and
   shock isolation systems that are fabricated using selective laser
   sintering (SLS). The dynamic behavior of the systems in response to base
   excitations is determined experimentally, and the results are compared
   to model-based predictions. The vibration isolation prototypes display
   isolation levels that are tunable by varying the axial compression of
   the beams. Double-beam systems are shown to provide greater reductions
   in resonance frequency than single-beam systems for comparable levels of
   axial compression. However, low-frequency isolation capabilities are
   sensitive to the high levels of precision required to obtain low levels
   of system stiffness. The shock isolation prototype provides isolation at
   prespecified threshold levels of force or acceleration. In the prototype
   system, an input shock with a peak acceleration of approximately 7 g is
   reduced to a peak acceleration of the isolated mass of approximately 1
   g. High levels of negative acceleration are observed in models and
   prototype systems when the buckled beam snaps back to its original
   position; however, models indicate that large negative accelerations can
   be mitigated using one-way dampers.}},

Abstract = {{Flame retardant polyamide 6 (nylon 6) nanocomposite nanofibers
   containing montmorillonite clay (MMT) platelets and intumescent
   non-halogenated flame retardant (FR) additives were processed by
   electrospinning. Different methods of mixing nano fillers before
   electrospinning were explored and compared. It was found that high
   loadings of nanoclay particles affected the electrospinnability of the
   nanocomposite material. Good dispersion and exfoliation of nanoclay
   platelets within individual nanofibers was verified by transmission
   electron microscopy. The degradation temperature of nanocomposite
   samples was lower than pristine nylon 6 samples. However the degradation
   of all nanocomposite formulations was overall slower. Moreover, the
   difference in residual char weight after decomposition was significant.
   Microscale combustion calorimeter results show that FR particles played
   a major role in reducing flammability of the material in both solution-
   and melt-compounded samples, while MMT nanoclay was effective in
   improving char residue and in reducing flammability in high-shear melt
   premixed samples.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular identification of protein molecules surrounding nanoparticles
   (NPs) may provide useful information that influences NP clearance,
   biodistribution, and toxicity. Hence, nanoproteomics provides specific
   information about the environment that NPs interact with and can
   therefore report on the changes in protein distribution that occurs
   during tumorigenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that characterization
   and identification of protein molecules that interact with 20 nm AuNPs
   from cancer and noncancer cells may provide mechanistic insights into
   the biology of tumor growth and metastasis and identify new therapeutic
   targets in ovarian cancer. Hence, in the present study, we
   systematically examined the interaction of the protein molecules with 20
   nm AuNPs from cancer and noncancerous cell lysates. Time-resolved
   proteomic profiles of NP-protein complexes demonstrated electrostatic
   interaction to be the governing factor in the initial time-points which
   are dominated by further stabilization interaction at longer time-points
   as determined by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), dynamic
   light scattering (DLS), measurements, transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Reduction in size, charge,
   and number of bound proteins were observed as the protein-NP complex
   stabilized over time. Interestingly, proteins related to mRNA processing
   were overwhelmingly represented on the NP-protein complex at all times.
   More importantly, comparative proteomic analyses revealed enrichment of
   a number of cancer-specific proteins on the AuNP surface. Network
   analyses of these proteins highlighted important hub nodes that could
   potentially be targeted for maximal therapeutic advantage in the
   treatment of ovarian cancer. The importance of this methodology and the
   biological significance of the network proteins were validated by a
   functional study of three hubs that exhibited variable connectivity,
   namely, PPA1, SMNDC1, and PI15. Western blot analysis revealed
   overexpression of these proteins in ovarian cancer cells when compared
   to normal cells. Silencing of PPA1, SMNDC1, and PI15 by the siRNA
   approach significantly inhibited proliferation of ovarian cancer cells
   and the effect correlated with the connectivity pattern obtained from
   our network analyses.}},

Abstract = {{A microarray containing three-dimensional (3D) tissue models is a
   promising substitute for the two-dimensional (2D) cell-based microarrays
   currently available for high throughput, tissue-based biomedical assays.
   A cell culture microenvironment similar to in vivo conditions could be
   achieved with biodegradable porous scaffolds. In this study, a laser
   foaming technique is developed to create an array of micro-scale 3D
   porous scaffolds. The effects of major process parameters and the
   morphology of the resulting porous structure were investigated. For
   comparison, cell culture studies were conducted with both foamed and
   unfoamed samples using T98G cells. The results show that by laser
   foaming gas-impregnated polylactic acid it is possible to generate an
   array of inverse cone shaped wells with porous walls. The size of the
   foamed region can be controlled with laser power and exposure time,
   while the pore size of the scaffold can be manipulated with the
   saturation pressure. T98G cells grow well in the foamed scaffolds,
   forming clusters that have not been observed in 2D cell cultures. Cells
   are more viable in the 3D scaffolds than in the 2D cell culture cases.
   The 3D porous microarray could be used for parallel studies of drug
   toxicity, guided stem cell differentiation, and DNA binding profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Management of Atrioesophageal Fistula Post-AF Ablation Introduction
   Atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) is a rare but devastating complication of
   radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF).
   Surgical repair and esophageal stents are available treatment options
   for AEF. We report outcomes of these 2 management strategies. Methods
   Nine patients with AEF post-RFCA for AF were included in this study. AEF
   was diagnosed based on symptoms and chest CT imaging. Of the 9 patients,
   5 received stents and 4 underwent surgical repair of fistula. Results AF
   ablation was performed under general anesthesia (n = 4) or conscious
   sedation (n = 5). During ablation, RF power was maintained between 25
   and 35 Watts in areas close to the esophagus and energy delivery
   discontinued when esophageal temperature reached 38 degrees C. Seven
   patients underwent ablation with 3.5-mm open-irrigated catheter, 1 with
   8-mm nonirrigated catheter, and 1 had surgical epicardial ablation.
   Seven patients received proton pump inhibitor and sucralfate before and
   after procedure. AEF symptoms developed within 2-6 weeks from ablation.
   Esophageal stenting was performed in 5 patients (median age 58 years,
   median time from RFCA 4 weeks) and 4 underwent surgical repair (median
   age 54 years, median time from RFCA 4 weeks) within 2-4 hours from
   diagnosis. All 5 patients receiving stents died within 1 week of the
   procedure due to cerebral embolism, septic shock, or respiratory
   failure. On the other hand, the 4 patients that received surgical repair
   were alive at median follow-up of 2.1 years (P = 0.005). Conclusions
   Esophageal stenting should be discouraged and prompt surgical repair is
   crucial for survival in patients with atrioesophageal fistula.}},

Abstract = {{A negative-index metawaveguide (NIMW) comprised of stacks of planar
   metal sheets loaded with periodic split-ring resonator apertures is
   modeled using a transmission-line (TL) analysis, and analyzed in detail.
   The proposed model provides a useful tool to extract the wave impedance
   and effective homogenized parameters of the metamaterial, ideal for
   design and optimization purposes. The dominant mode of the NIMW is
   transverse-magnetic, with a large longitudinal component of the electric
   field that enables its strong interaction with an electron beam and
   opens new opportunities for microwave generation and radiation
   detection. The inherent bi-anisotropy of its loaded inclusions is also
   examined within our TL theoretical framework, and a solution design to
   suppress its effect is presented. Finally, since the proposed geometry
   is shown to support an additional transverse-electromagnetic mode due to
   strong spatial dispersion, proper excitation of the NIMW is discussed
   and simulated.}},

Abstract = {{The overall goal of this work is to quantify the effects of
   environmental variability and spatial sampling on the accuracy and
   uncertainty of estimates of the three-dimensional ocean sound-speed
   field. In this work, ocean sound speed estimates are obtained with
   acoustic data measured by a sparse autonomous observing system using a
   perturbative inversion scheme {[}Rajan, Lynch, and Frisk, J. Acoust.
   Soc. Am. 82, 998-1017 (1987)]. The vertical and horizontal resolution of
   the solution depends on the bandwidth of acoustic data and on the
   quantity of sources and receivers, respectively. Thus, for a simple,
   range-independent ocean sound speed profile, a single source-receiver
   pair is sufficient to estimate the water-column sound-speed field. On
   the other hand, an environment with significant variability may not be
   fully characterized by a large number of sources and receivers,
   resulting in uncertainty in the solution. This work explores the
   interrelated effects of environmental variability and spatial sampling
   on the accuracy and uncertainty of the inversion solution though a set
   of case studies. Synthetic data representative of the ocean variability
   on the New Jersey shelf are used. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{A surface micromachined microphone is presented with 230 kHz bandwidth.
   The structure uses a 2.25 mu m thick, 315 mu m radius polysilicon
   diaphragm suspended above an 11 mu m gap to form a variable
   parallel-plate capacitance. The back cavity of the microphone consists
   of the 11 mu m thick air volume immediately behind the moving diaphragm
   and also an extended lateral cavity with a radius of 504 mu m. The
   dynamic frequency response of the sensor in response to electrostatic
   signals is presented using laser Doppler vibrometry and indicates a
   system compliance of 0.4 nm/Pa in the flat-band of the response. The
   sensor is configured for acoustic signal detection using a charge
   amplifier, and signal-to-noise ratio measurements and simulations are
   presented. A resolution of 0.80 mPa/ root Hz (32 dB sound pressure level
   in a 1 Hz bin) is achieved in the flat-band portion of the response
   extending from 10 kHz to 230 kHz. The proposed sensor design is

Abstract = {{Hybrids of silver nanoparticle-decorated reduced graphene oxide (Ag-RGO)
   have been prepared with the use of poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) as a
   versatile capping agent to develop volatile organic compound (VOC)
   sensors. The hybrid materials of Ag-RGO/PIL were assembled into
   three-dimensional-laminated nanostructures, where spherical Ag
   nanoparticles with diameters between 50 and 300 nm were homogeneously
   distributed on the graphene sheets and interspaced between them.
   Ag-RGO/PIL sensors were fabricated by spray layer-by-layer technique and
   used to detect a set of polar (methanol, ethanol, methyl acetate,
   acetone and water) and non-polar (chloroform, dichlorobenzene, toluene
   and styrene) organic vapours. Much higher sensitivity and
   discriminability were obtained for polar vapours although non-polar ones
   could also be detected. In comparison with either simple reduced
   graphene oxide or carbon nanotubes (CNT) functionalised by PIL, the
   hybrid Ag-RGO/PIL-based sensors showed superior performances in terms of
   sensitivity, selectivity, stability and high reliability. For example, a
   signal-to-noise ratio up to 168 was obtained for 1 ppm of methanol and
   signals drift between two experiments spaced out in the time of 3 months
   was less than 3 \%. It is expected that by extrapolation, a limit of
   detection at the parts per billion level can be reached. These results
   are promising to design e-noses based on high stability chemoresistive
   sensors for emerging applications such as anticipated diagnostic of food
   degradation or diseases by the analysis of VOC, some of them being in
   this case considered as biomarkers.}},

Abstract = {{In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the prevalence of hypertension is very
   high, escalating with diminishing renal function. Typically, the
   diagnosis of hypertension and the clinical decisions regarding its
   treatment are based on daytime clinic blood pressure (BP) measurements.
   However, the correlation between BP level and target organ damage,
   cardiovascular risk and long-term prognosis is greater for ambulatory
   than clinic measurements. Moreover, evidence is consistent among
   numerous studies that the elevated risk and incidence of end-organ
   injury and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events are significantly
   associated with blunted night-time BP decline, and that the asleep BP
   better predicts cardiovascular events than either the awake or 24-h BP
   mean. The prevalence of abnormally high asleep BP is extensive in CKD,
   significantly increasing with its severity. In CKD, the diagnoses of
   hypertension and its therapeutic control are often inaccurate in the
   absence of complete and careful assessment of the entire 24 h, i.e.
   daytime and night-time, BP pattern. Accordingly, ambulatory BP
   monitoring should be the preferred method to comprehensively assess and
   decide the optimal clinical management of patients with CKD. Recent
   findings indicate therapeutic restoration of normal physiologic BP
   reduction during night-time sleep is the most significant independent
   predictor of decreased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk, both in
   patients with and without CKD, and is best achieved when
   antihypertensive medications, mainly those blocking the
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, are routinely taken at bedtime.}},

Abstract = {{Sliding block displacements are used to evaluate the potential for
   seismic slope instability. Deterministic approaches are typically used
   to predict the expected level of sliding block displacement, although
   they do not rigorously account for uncertainties in the expected ground
   shaking, dynamic response, or displacement prediction. As a result,
   there is no concept of the actual hazard associated with the
   displacement computed by the deterministic approach. This paper
   summarizes and extends recent developments related to the probabilistic
   assessment of sliding block displacements. The probabilistic approach
   generates a hazard curve for displacement in which the annual rate of
   exceedance for a range of displacement levels is computed. The
   probabilistic approach is formulated both in terms of scalar hazard
   analysis (i.e., using one ground motion parameter, peak ground
   acceleration) and vector hazard analysis (i.e., using two ground motion
   parameters, peak ground acceleration and peak ground velocity), and
   applied both to rigid and flexible sliding block conditions. Generally,
   the vector probabilistic approach predicts displacements that are 2-3
   times smaller than the scalar probabilistic approach, revealing the
   value of characterizing frequency content via peak ground velocity.
   Comparisons between the deterministic and probabilistic approaches, in
   either a scalar or vector context, indicate that the deterministic
   approach can severely underestimate displacements relative to the
   probabilistic approach because it ignores the aleatory variabilities in
   the dynamic and sliding responses of the sliding mass. This
   under-prediction is most significant for longer period sliding masses.
   Modifications to the deterministic approach are proposed that provide
   displacements that are more consistent with the probabilistic approach.}},

Journal = {{COASTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{171-181}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The SWAN + ADCIRC shallow-water circulation model, validated for
   Hurricane Ike (2008), was used to develop five synthetic storm surge
   scenarios for the upper Texas coast in which wind speed was increased
   and landfall location was shifted 40 km westward. The Hurricane Ike
   simulation and the synthetic storms were used to study the maximum water
   elevations in Galveston Bay, as well as the timing and behavior of surge
   relative to the hurricane track. Sixteen locations indicative of surge
   behavior in and around Galveston Bay Were chosen to for analysis in this
   paper. Results show that water surface elevations present in Galveston
   Bay are dominated by the counterclockwise hurricane winds and that
   increasing wind speeds by 15\% results in approximately 23\% (+/-3\%)
   higher surge. Furthermore, shifting the storm westward causes higher
   levels of surge in the more populated areas due to more intense, higher
   shore-normal winds. This research helps to highlight the vulnerability
   of the upper Texas Gulf Coast to hurricane storm surge and lends insight
   to storm surge and flood mitigation studies in the Houston-Galveston
   region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{901-915}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Oral delivery of therapeutics, particularly protein-based
   pharmaceutics, is of great interest for safe and controlled drug
   delivery for patients. Hydrogels offer excellent potential as oral
   therapeutic systems due to inherent biocompatibility, diversity of both
   natural and synthetic material options and tunable properties. In
   particular, stimuli-responsive hydrogels exploit physiological changes
   along the intestinal tract to achieve site-specific, controlled release
   of protein, peptide and chemotherapeutic molecules for both local and
   systemic treatment applications.
   Areas covered: This review provides a wide perspective on the
   therapeutic use of hydrogels in oral delivery systems. General features
   and advantages of hydrogels are addressed, with more considerable focus
   on stimuli-responsive systems that respond to pH or enzymatic changes in
   the gastrointestinal environment to achieve controlled drug release.
   Specific examples of therapeutics are given. Last, in vitro and in vivo
   methods to evaluate hydrogel performance are discussed.
   Expert opinion: Hydrogels are excellent candidates for oral drug
   delivery, due to the number of adaptable parameters that enable
   controlled delivery of diverse therapeutic molecules. However, further
   work is required to more accurately simulate physiological conditions
   and enhance performance, which is important to achieve improved
   bioavailability and increase commercial interest.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Characterization and design of fluid-thermal transport through random
   porous sintered beds is critical for improving the performance of
   two-phase heat transport devices such as heat pipes. Two-dimensional
   imaging techniques are quite well developed and commonly employed for
   microstructure and material characterization. In this study, we employ
   2D image data (thin sections) for measuring critical microstructural
   features of commercial wicks for use in correlation-based prediction of
   transport properties. We employ a stochastic characterization
   methodology based on the two-point autocorrelation function, and compare
   the predicted properties such as particle and pore diameters and
   permeability with those from our previously published studies, in which
   3D X-ray microtomography data was employed for reconstruction. Further,
   we implement a reconstruction technique for reconstructing a
   three-dimensional stochastic equivalent structure from the thin
   sections. These reconstructed domains are employed for predicting
   effective thermal conductivity, permeability and interfacial heat
   transfer coefficient in single-phase flow. The current computations are
   found to compare well with models and correlations from the literature,
   as well as our previous numerical studies. Finally, we propose a new
   parametrized model for the design of porous materials based on the
   nature of the two-point autocorrelation functions. Using this model, we
   reconstruct sample three-dimensional microstructures, and analyze the
   influence of various parameters on fluid-thermal properties of interest.
   With advances in additive manufacturing techniques, such an approach may
   eventually be employed to design intricate porous structures with
   properties tailored to specific applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Current injury models suggest that Schwann cell (SC) migration and
   guidance are necessary for successful regeneration and synaptic
   reconnection after peripheral nerve injury. The ability of conducting
   polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) to exhibit chemical, contact and
   electrical stimuli for cells has led to much interest in their use for
   neural conduits. Despite this interest, there has been very little
   research on the effect that electrical stimulation (ES) using PPy has on
   SC behavior. Here we investigate the mechanism by which SCs interact
   with PPy in the presence of an electric field. Additionally, we explored
   the effect that the adsorption of different serum proteins on PPy upon
   the application of an electric field has on SC migration. The results
   indicate an increase in average displacement of the SC with ES,
   resulting in a net anodic migration. Moreover, indirect effects of
   protein adsorption due to the oxidation of the film upon the application
   of ES were shown to have a larger effect on migration speed than on
   migration directionality. These results suggest that SC migration speed
   is governed by an integrin- or receptor-mediated mechanism, whereas SC
   migration directionality is governed by electrically mediated phenomena.
   These data will prove invaluable in optimizing conducting polymers for
   their different biomedical applications such as nerve repair. (C) 2014

   Modularization}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Modularization is a well-established technique that can improve the
   construction industry by exporting a portion of site-based work to
   fabrication shops. However, its application in the industry is limited.
   The Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) industry needs new
   approaches to reach higher levels of modularization. The purpose of this
   study is to determine what changes in current EPC processes are needed
   to create an optimal environment for a broader and more effective use of
   modularization. In creating such an nvironment, it is necessary to know
   the factors that lead to success. The most influential critical success
   factors (CSFs; 21 total) have been determined by the expertise of a
   research team who compiled a detailed list by adding CSF enablers. CSF
   enablers are additional steps that can facilitate accomplishment of the
   associated CSF. A closer look at the top five CSFs indicates that
   project teams should pay particular attention to module envelope
   limitations, team agreement on project drivers, adequate owner-planning
   resources and processes, timely freeze of scoping and design, and due
   recognition of possible early completion from modularization. This CSFs
   analysis and addition of enablers provide guidelines and ways to
   implement strategies for successful modularization in a project and
   leverages modularization to benefit capital projects.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a version of the stochastic network interdiction problem
   modeled by Morton et al. (IIE Trans 39:3-14, 2007) in which an
   interdictor attempts to minimize a potential smuggler's chance of
   evasion via discrete deployment of sensors on arcs in a bipartite
   network. The smuggler reacts to sensor deployments by solving a
   maximum-reliability path problem on the resulting network. In this
   paper, we develop the (minimal) convex hull representation for the
   polytope linking the interdictor's decision variables with the
   smuggler's for the case in which the smuggler's origin and destination
   are known and interdictions are cardinality-constrained. In the process,
   we propose an exponential class of easily-separable inequalities that
   generalize all of those developed so far for the bipartite version of
   this problem. We show how these cuts may be employed in a cutting-plane
   fashion when solving the more difficult problem in which the smuggler's
   origin and destination are stochastic, and argue that some instances of
   the stochastic model have facets corresponding to the solution of
   NP-hard problems. Our computational results show that the cutting planes
   developed in this paper may strengthen the linear programming relaxation
   of the stochastic model by as much as 25 \%.}},

Abstract = {{A fracture mechanics approach to accelerated life testing of cathodic
   delamination between steel and polyurea is presented. This required the
   hyperelastic behavior of the polyurea to be described by the Marlow
   model based on uniaxial tension and plane strain compression tests.
   Time-dependence was also considered but could be neglected if proper
   test protocols were followed in cathodic delamination tests using a
   strip blister specimen. The variation of J-integral with specimen
   geometry and loading parameter was obtained, which allowed the
   resistance to cathodic delamination to be expressed in terms the
   J-integral and the crack speeds obtained from the tests at several
   temperatures. The approach established that both temperature and stress
   can be used to accelerate the cathodic delamination, thereby providing a
   quantitative and rational basis for conducting accelerated testing. In
   addition, the discriminating nature of the approach for design purposes
   was exemplified by quantitatively establishing differences in the
   delamination resistance of three surface treatments. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Inflammation, a precursor to many diseases including cancer and
   atherosclerosis, induces differential surface expression of specific
   vascular molecules. Blood-borne nanoparticles (NPs), loaded with
   therapeutic and imaging agents, can recognize and use these molecules as
   vascular docking sites. Here, a computational model is developed within
   the isogeometric analysis framework to understand and predict the
   vascular deposition of NPs within an inflamed arterial tree. The NPs
   have a diameter ranging from 0.1 to m and are decorated with antibodies
   directed toward three endothelial adhesion molecules, namely
   intravascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion
   molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin, whose surface density depends on
   the local wall shear stress. Results indicate VCAM-1 targeted NPs adhere
   more, with ICAM-1 directed NPs adhering least efficiently, resulting in
   approximately an order-of-magnitude lower average particle surface
   density. ICAM-1 and E-selectin directed m NPs are distributed more
   uniformly (heterogeneity index 0.9 and 1.0, respectively) over the
   bifurcating vascular branches compared to their VCAM-1 counterparts
   (heterogeneity index 1.4). When the NPs are coated with antibodies for
   VCAM-1 and E-selectin in equal proportions, a more uniform vascular
   distribution is achieved compared with VCAM-1-only targeted particles,
   thus demonstrating the advantage of NP multivalency in vascular
   targeting. Furthermore, the larger NPs (m) adhere more ( 200 \%) in the
   lower branches compared to the upper branch. This computational
   framework provides insights into how size, ligand type, density, and
   multivalency can be manipulated to enhance NP vascular adhesion in an
   individual patient.}},

Abstract = {{The capacitance-resistance model (CRM) is an alternative to conventional
   reservoir simulation. CRM, a simplification of complex numerical models,
   uses production and injection rates to infer a reservoir description.
   There is no prior geologic model. The principal output of CRM fitting is
   the fraction of injected fluid (usually water) that is produced at a
   producer at steady-state. These fractions are interwell connectivities.
   Interwell connectivities are fundamental information needed to manage
   waterfloods in oil reservoirs. The data-driven CRM is a fast tool to
   estimate these parameters in mature fields and allows one to make full
   use of the dynamic data available. This paper considers the problem of
   setting an upper bound on the uncertainty of interwell connectivities
   for linear-constrained models. Using analytical bounds and numerical
   simulations, we derive a consistent upper limit on the uncertainty of
   interwell connections that can be used to quantify the information
   content of a given dataset.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated building load-ground source heat pump model is developed
   to capture short-term (30 s) and long-term (10-20 yr) performance of
   ground source heat pumps with vertical boreholes. The model takes
   advantage of the built-in computation and organization functions of the
   SIMULINK (R)/MATLAB environment to couple the component building load,
   heat pump, and ground loop models at every time step. The building load
   model uses the HAMBASE thermal program and is applicable to residential
   and commercial buildings. The heat pump model uses manufacturer data and
   sensible heat corrections to accurately model heat pump operation across
   a wide range of input conditions. The ground loop model is a combination
   of Hellstrom's borehole tube model, Eskillson's long-term (>10 yr)
   g-function ground model and the one-dimensional, short-term (<5 min)
   numerical ground model by Xu. Fifteen year simulation results for a base
   case residential house are presented to illustrate the integrated
   model's ability to predict a wide range of time responses and to
   illustrate a limiting ground loop sizing criterion that reveals the slow
   degradation in system performance due ground heating effects.
   Simulations with varying borehole lengths also illustrate the
   sensitivity of ground loop sizing on the system's thermal and economic
   performances. The work emphasizes the importance of proper borehole
   sizing, design, and placement especially in cooling-dominated climates,
   where the unbalance of heat loads to the ground cause slowly rising

Abstract = {{We simulate non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a GaAs(1 1 0)
   surface using a real-space ab initio pseudopotential method. While most
   ab initio simulations include an explicit model for the AFM tip, our
   method does not introduce the tip modeling step. This approach results
   in a considerable reduction of computational work, and also provides
   complete AFM images, which can be directly compared to experiment. By
   analyzing tip-surface interaction forces in both our results and
   previous ab initio simulations, we find that our method provides very
   similar force profile to the pure Si tip results. We conclude that our
   method works well for systems in which the tip is not chemically active.

Abstract = {{This paper discusses design and control of a prismatic series elastic
   actuator with high mechanical power output in a small and lightweight
   form factor. A design is introduced that pushes the performance boundary
   of electric series elastic actuators by using high motor voltage coupled
   with an efficient drivetrain to enable large continuous actuator force
   while retaining speed. Compact size is achieved through the use of a
   novel piston-style ball screw support mechanism and a concentric
   compliant element. Generic models for two common series elastic actuator
   configurations are introduced and compared. These models are then used
   to develop controllers for force and position tracking based on
   combinations of PID, model-based, and disturbance observer control
   structures. Finally, our actuator's performance is demonstrated through
   a series of experiments designed to operate the actuator at the limits
   of its mechanical and control capability.}},

Abstract = {{Confinement of light is usually achieved by reducing the photonic
   density of states of the surrounding environment, as in waveguides and

   recently shown to exist within the radiation continuum in large periodic

   Here we demonstrate that under special conditions it may be possible to
   induce three-dimensional photonic embedded eigenvalues in a
   subwavelength open scattering system. The striking properties of these
   optical states without radiation loss may lead to unprecedented light

Abstract = {{A single-phase crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)(2)F material has been prepared
   by the solvothermal method. Partial ion exchange between Na and Li was
   then used to form Na3-xLixV2O2(PO4)(2)F. The two materials were studied
   as positive cathodes by physical characterization, electrochemical
   measurements, and simulation. With density functional theory
   calculations, four stable phases of NaxV2O2(PO4)(2)F were identified at
   the Na concentrations of x = 0, 1, 2, 3. The transitions between these
   phases give rise to three values of the Na chemical potential and three
   voltage plateaus for Na intercalation. The lower two voltages,
   corresponding to removal of the first two Na per formula unit, agree
   well with the corresponding experimental electrochemical measurements.
   Removal of the third Na, however, is not observed experimentally,
   because it is outside of the (4.8 V) stability window of the
   electrolyte. This observation is consistent with our calculations that
   show that the last Na will only be removed at 5.3 V, owing to the
   stability of the V-O bonding state and a strong Coulomb attraction
   between the Na and the anions. Computational modifications of the
   material were considered to activate the third Na with an oxidation
   energy in the electrolyte stability window, including swapping the
   anions from O and F to less-electronegative Cl and Br. The most
   promising material, Na3V2Cl2(PO4)(2)F, is found to be stable and a good
   candidate as a Na cathode because all three Na ions can be reversibly
   removed without significant reduction in the cell potential or energy
   density of the material. Finally, we show that Li can partially replace
   Na and that these Li intercalate into the material with a higher rate
   owing to a lower diffusion barrier as compared to Na.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the vibrational modes and Raman spectra of P-doped Si
   nanocrystals using pseudopotential density functional theory and the

   spectra of doped nanocrystals are enhanced relative to those of pristine

   Thus, Raman has the potential of being developed as a tool for probing
   the location of the dopant within the nanocrystal. Our analysis shows
   that vibrational modes involving atoms in the vicinity of the dopant
   give the largest contributions to the Raman spectra.}},

Abstract = {{The harmonic approximation to transition state theory simplifies the
   problem of calculating a chemical reaction rate to identifying relevant
   low energy saddle points in a chemical system. Here, we present a saddle
   point finding method which does not require knowledge of specific
   product states. In the method, the potential energy landscape is
   transformed into the square of the gradient, which converts all critical
   points of the original potential energy surface into global minima. A
   biasing term is added to the gradient squared landscape to stabilize the
   low energy saddle points near a minimum of interest, and destabilize
   other critical points. We demonstrate that this method is competitive
   with the dimer min-mode following method in terms of the number of force
   evaluations required to find a set of low-energy saddle points around a
   reactant minimum. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Pages = {{4758-4766}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing the in vivo dynamics of the polyclonal antibody
   repertoire in serum, such as that which might arise in response to
   stimulation with an antigen, is difficult due to the presence of many
   highly similar immunoglobulin proteins, each specified by distinct B
   lymphocytes. These challenges have precluded the use of conventional
   mass spectrometry for antibody identification based on peptide mass
   spectral matches to a genomic reference database. Recently, progress has
   been made using bottom-up analysis of serum antibodies by nanoflow
   liquid chromatography/high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry combined
   with a sample-specific antibody sequence database generated by
   high-throughput sequencing of individual B cell immunoglobulin variable
   domains (V genes). Here, we describe how intrinsic features of antibody
   primary structure, most notably the interspersed segments of variable
   and conserved amino acid sequences, generate recurring patterns in the
   corresponding peptide mass spectra of V gene peptides, greatly
   complicating the assignment of correct sequences to mass spectral data.
   We show that the standard method of decoy-based error modeling fails to
   account for the error introduced by these highly similar sequences,
   leading to a significant underestimation of the false discovery rate.
   Because of these effects, antibody-derived peptide mass spectra require
   increased stringency in their interpretation. The use of filters based
   on the mean precursor ion mass accuracy of peptide-spectrum matches is
   shown to be particularly effective in distinguishing between ``true{''}
   and ``false{''} identifications. These findings highlight important
   caveats associated with the use of standard database search and
   error-modeling methods with nonstandard data sets and custom sequence
   databases.}},

Abstract = {{Amine scrubbing is an efficient method for carbon and sequestration, but
   secondary amines present in all amine solvents can form carcinogenic
   nitrosamines. Decomposition kinetics for n-nitrosopiperazine (MNPZ),
   nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA), and nitroso-(2-hydroxyethyl) glycine
   (NHeGly) were measured over a range of temperature, base concentration,
   base strength, and CO2 loading pertinent to amine scrubbing. MNPZ and
   NDELA decomposition is first order in the nitrosamine, half order in
   base concentration, and base-catalyzed with a Bronsted slope of beta =
   0.5. The activation energy is 94, 106, and 112 kJ/mol for MNPZ, NDELA,
   and NHeGly, respectively. MNPZ readily decomposes at 150 degrees C in 5
   M piperazine, making thermal decomposition an important mechanism for
   MNPZ control. However, NHeGly and NDELA are too stable at 120 degrees C
   in 7 M monoethanolamine (MEA) for thermal decomposition to be important.
   Base treatment during reclaiming could rapidly and selectively decompose
   NHeGly and NDELA to mitigate nitrosamine accumulation in MEA.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor particulate contaminants can be generated in many ways, commonly
   from human activities, infiltration of HVAC systems, or resuspension
   from indoor surfaces. Most of these sources are transient and generate
   nonuniform particle distribution in the space. This study used
   experimental and numerical methods to investigate the dispersion of
   three different particle sizes (0.7, 2.5, and 7 mu m) emitted from
   typical source positions. A test room and simplified thermal manikins
   were employed to mimic a realistic indoor environment, and experimental
   data were compared with particle modeling using the Lagrangian method
   coupled with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and large eddy
   simulation (LES) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) turbulence models.
   Particle dispersion was studied for two ventilation patterns:
   buoyancy-driven ventilation and well-mixed ventilation. The results
   provided a comparison of Lagrangian-RANS particle modeling,
   Lagrangian-LES particle modeling, and experimental data considering
   nonuniform temporal and spatial particle concentrations. Experimental
   and modeling results were evaluated with three different metrics: peak
   normalized concentration at various locations, peak-concentration
   occurrence time, and mean exposure defined as the averaged concentration
   in the occupant's breathing zone. The results show that Lagrangian-LES
   more accurately predicts concentration fluctuation during particle
   emission. Considering long-term exposure, however, both methods show
   similar results.}},

Volume = {{458}},

Abstract = {{It was recently shown that the rare of the thermal rearrangement process
   of an ortho-functional polyimide is thickness dependent. Here it is
   shown that the gas separation properties of thermally rearranged (TR)
   polymer films are also affected by thickness in this work, the physical
   aging and plasticization behavior of TR polymers were tracked using thin
   (similar to 1-2 mu m) and thick (similar to 15-20 mu m) films derived
   from an ortho-functional polyimide based on
   2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA) and
   3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-biphenyl (NAB) over hundreds of hours. The
   thin films experienced a much greater rate of physical aging than the
   thick films, as indicated by the rapid decline of gas permeabilities and
   the gradual increase of ideal selectivities. As the thermal
   rearrangement temperature was increased, the aging rate of the resultant
   thin film did not increase extensively and the plasticization curves of
   the thin and thick films became closer. Long term exposure of the TR
   films to CO2 at 32 atm over 500 h shows that the CO2 permeability of the
   thick TR films did not show significant decline over time; whereas, the
   CO2 permeability of the thin TR films increased over the first several
   hours and decreased rapidly during further exposure Lime. Finally, the
   response of thick TR films to C2H4, C2H6 and C3H8 over long term
   exposure shows that physical aging is greatly accelerated when the
   polymer matrix is severely plasticized by the more condensable gases.

Title = {{Free-standing graphene oxide thin films assembled by a pressurized
   ultrafiltration method for dehydration of ethanol}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{458}},
Pages = {{199-208}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Free-standing graphene oxide (GO) thin films have been assembled by a
   pressurized ultrafiltration method. The GO films exhibit a layered
   microstructure with high structural stability and hydrophilicity, as
   analyzed by XPS, FESEM, XRD, positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS),
   etc. The effects of ultrafiltration pressure and feed composition on the
   film's microstructure and pervaporation performance for dehydration of
   ethanol were investigated and correlated with XRD and PAS observations.
   Experimental results suggest that the interlaminar spacing is determined
   by both packing density of GO nanosheets and water content in the feed
   solution. The packing density is sensitively affected by the
   ultrafiltration pressure applied during film formation. By tuning the
   ultrafiltration pressure, a high separation performance with water
   permeability of 13,800 Barrer (1 Barrer = 3.348 x 10(-19) kmol m m(-2) S
   Pa-1) and water/ethanol selectivity of 227 is achieved for dehydration
   of an 85 wt\% ethanol aqueous solution at 24 degrees C. Additionally,
   the total permeability varied from 50 to 113,000 Barrer by increasing
   the water content in the feed from 0 to 100 wt\%. As a result, the ideal
   water/ethanol selectivity calculated from single-component feed tests is
   about 2260 which is much higher than the selectivity obtained from
   binary-component feed tests. This discrepancy is probably attributed to
   the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between water molecules
   and the functional groups on GO nanosheets that enlarges the
   interlaminar spacing and allows more ethanol transport through the GO
   film. The interactions among the GO nanosheets and the feed components
   enable the film to effectively dehydrate ethanol via pervaporation. (C)

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{244}},
Pages = {{505-513}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The recovery of usable product water in brackish water reverse osmosis
   (RO) desalination is limited by the potential for membrane scaling. This
   limited recovery results in high costs of disposal of the concentrate
   (waste) stream. Concentrate treatment to improve recovery is vital, and
   treatment that includes antiscalant oxidation prior to precipitation and
   solid/liquid separation might allow increased precipitation through
   antiscalant deactivation. Ozone and hydrogen peroxide were used to
   oxidize phosphonate-type antiscalants under varying conditions of water
   composition, pH, ozone dose, and antiscalant type; orthophosphate (P) is
   an oxidation product and was used to measure the extent of oxidation.
   Antiscalant oxidation increases with ozone dose (1-10 rng/L O-3) and in
   the presence of calcium, from 1 mg/L P to 7 mg/L P for an antiscalant
   concentration of 27 mg/L as P. The addition of hydrogen peroxide causes
   only minor increases in antiscalant oxidation. The extent of oxidation
   varies with pH as a function of metal-ligand speciation, with the
   doubly-protonated metal-ligand species dominating the reactivity of the
   antiscalant. In the presence of calcium, the primary oxidation pathway
   for phosphonate antiscalants is through direct reaction with ozone
   (70-80\% of measured P). In the absence of calcium, ozone and hydroxyl
   radicals appear to contribute relatively equally to oxidation. These
   results suggest phosphonate antiscalants can be oxidized with relatively
   low ozone doses, thereby deactivating the chelating behavior of the
   antiscalant and allowing increased precipitation of scaling salts such
   as calcium and magnesium. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Classical stability theory can be used to estimate the critical velocity

   0.2, 0.4, 0.8 ft/day. The surfactant flood at 0.2 ft/day was a nearly
   stable displacement whereas the floods at 0.4 and 0.8 ft/day were
   unstable with visually obvious fingers. The stability theory is in good
   agreement with experimental results. The proposed theory and
   experimental results offer new insight into the behavior of surfactant
   floods stabilized by gravity forces and in particular the importance of
   the microemulsion phase and its properties, especially its viscosity. It
   is very important to measure the microemulsion viscosity and account for
   its effect on the critical velocity. Furthermore, the microemulsion
   viscosity can be optimized to improve the velocity for a stable
   displacement. This insight opens up a new pathway for optimizing
   surfactant floods without mobility control. It is possible to design an
   efficient surfactant flood without any mobility control if the
   surfactant solution is injected at a low velocity in horizontal wells at
   the bottom of the geological zone and the oil captured in horizontal
   wells at the top of the zone. This approach is practical if the vertical
   permeability of the geological zone is high. Under favorable reservoir
   conditions, gravity-stable surfactant floods may be an attractive
   alternative to surfactant-polymer floods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Doped metal oxide nanocrystals represent an exciting frontier for
   colloidal synthesis of plasmonic materials, displaying unique
   optoelectronic properties and showing promise for a variety of
   applications. However, fundamental questions about the nature of doping
   in these materials remain. In this article, the strong influence of
   radial dopant distribution on the optoelectronic properties of colloidal
   indium tin oxide nanocrystals is reported. Comparing elemental
   depth-profiling by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with detailed
   modeling and simulation of the optical extinction of these nanocrystals
   using the Drude model for free electrons, a correlation between surface
   segregation of tin ions and the average activation of dopants is
   observed. A strong influence of surface segregation of tin on the line
   shape of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is also
   reported. Samples with tin segregated near the surface show a symmetric
   line shape that suggests weak or no damping of the plasmon by ionized
   impurities. It is suggested that segregation of tin near the surface
   facilitates compensation of the dopant ions by electronic defects and
   oxygen interstitials, thus reducing activation. A core shell model is
   proposed to explain the observed differences in line shape. These
   results demonstrate the nuanced role of dopant distribution in
   determining the optoelectronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals
   and suggest that more detailed study of the distribution and structure
   of defects in plasmonic colloidal nanocrystals is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{A substantial amount of Mn2+ has been aliovalently substituted by V3+ in
   cationdeficient LiMn1-3x/2Vx square x/2PO4 (0 <= x <= 0.20) by a
   low-temperature (<300 degrees C) microwave-assisted solvothermal (MW-ST)
   process. The necessity of a low-temperature synthesis to achieve higher
   levels of doping is demonstrated as the solubility of vanadium decreases
   with the formation of impurity phases on heating the samples to >= 575
   degrees C. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals enhanced Mn O
   hybridization in the vanadium-doped samples, which is believed to
   facilitate an increase in capacity with increasing vanadium content in
   the lattice. For example, a high capacity of 155 mAh/g is achieved above
   a cutoff voltage of 3 V without any carbon coating for the x = 0.2
   sample. The vanadium substitution enhances the overall kinetics of the
   material by lowering the charge-transfer impedance and increasing the
   lithium-diffusion coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{In our work toward developing ester-containing self-assembling peptides
   as soft biomaterials, we have found that a fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
   (Fmoc)-conjugated alanine-lactic acid (Ala-Lac) sequence self-assembles
   into nanostructures that gel in water. This process occurs despite
   Fmoc-Ala-Lac's inability to interact with other Fmoc-Ala-Lac molecules
   via beta-sheet-like amide-amide hydrogen bonding, a condition previously
   thought to be crucial to the self-assembly of Fmoc-conjugated peptides.
   Experimental comparisons of Fmoc-Ala-Lac to its self-assembling peptide
   sequence analogue Fmoc-Ala-Ala using a variety of microscopic,
   spectroscopic, and bulk characterization techniques demonstrate distinct
   features of the two systems and show that while angstrom-scale
   self-assembled structures are similar, their nanometer-scale size and
   morphological properties diverge and give rise to different bulk
   mechanical properties. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to
   gain more insight into the differences between the two systems. An
   analysis of the hydrogen-bonding and solvent-surface interface
   properties of the simulated fibrils revealed that Fmoc-Ala-Lac fibrils
   are stronger and less hydrophilic than Fmoc-Ala-Ala fibrils. We propose
   that this difference in fibril amphiphilicity gives rise to differences
   in the higher-order assembly of fibrils into nanostructures seen in TEM.
   Importantly, we confirm experimentally that beta-sheet-type hydrogen
   bonding is not crucial to the self-assembly of short, conjugated
   peptides, and we demonstrate computationally that the amide bond in such
   systems may act mainly to mediate the solvation of the self-assembled
   single fibrils and therefore regulate a more extensive higher-order
   aggregation of fibrils. This work provides a basic understanding for
   future research in designing highly degradable self-assembling materials
   with peptide-like bioactivity for biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The permeability-selectivity upper bounds show that perfluoropolymers
   have uniquely different separation characteristics than
   hydrocarbon-based polymers. For separating helium from hydrogen, these
   differences are particularly dramatic. At a given helium permeability,
   the upper bound defined by perfluoropolymers has helium/hydrogen
   selectivities that are 2.5 times higher than that of the upper bound
   defined by hydrocarbon-based polymers. Robeson hypothesized that these
   differences in transport properties resulted from the unusual sorption
   relationships of gases in perfluoropolymers compared to
   hydrocarbon-based polymers, and this paper seeks to test this hypothesis
   experimentally. To do so, the gas permeability, sorption, and diffusion
   coefficients were determined at 35 degrees C for hydrogen and helium in
   a series of hydrocarbon-, silicon-, and fluorocarbon-based polymers.
   Highly or completely fluorinated polymers have separation
   characteristics above the upper-bound for helium/hydrogen separation
   because they maintain good diffusivity selectivities for helium over
   hydrogen and they have helium/hydrogen sorption selectivities much
   closer to unity than those of hydrocarbon-based samples. The
   silicon-based polymer had intermediate sorption selectivities between
   those of hydrocarbon-based polymers and perfluoropolymers. Comparisons
   of hydrogen and helium sorption data in the literature more broadly
   extend the conclusion that helium/hydrogen sorption selectivity is
   rather different in hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon-based media.}},

Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{The operation of chemical processes is inherently subject to
   uncertainty. Traditionally, uncertainties have been accounted for in
   system design by discretizing the uncertainty space and considering the
   resulting ensemble of scenarios in solving the design optimization
   problem. Scenario-based approaches are computationally demanding and can
   rapidly become intractable. We propose identification-based optimization
   (IBO) as a novel framework for the optimal design of dynamical systems
   under uncertainty. Our method originates in nonlinear system
   identification theory, and is predicated on representing uncertain
   variables as pseudo-random multi-level signals (PRMSs), which are
   imposed on the system model during each time integration step of a
   dynamic optimization. The uncertainty space is thus efficiently sampled
   without using computationally expensive scenario sets. We establish a
   procedure for generating PRMSs for uncertain variables based on their
   probability density functions. The computational benefits of IBO are
   illustrated through comparative case studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The search for new double-perovskite oxides has grown rapidly in recent
   years because of their interesting physical properties like
   ferroelectricity, magnetism, and multiferroics. The synthesis of double

   needs to be made under high pressure, which is a drawback for applying
   these materials. Here we have demonstrated synthetic routes at ambient
   pressure by which we have obtained a high-quality duo-sites-ordered
   double perovskite, CaCu3Fe2Sb2O12, which has been previously synthesized
   under high pressure. The availability of a large quantity of the powder
   sample allows us to determine the crystal and magnetic structures by
   neutron powder diffraction (NPD) at 300 and 1.3 K. Measurements of the
   magnetization and heat capacity showed a ferrimagnetic transition at 160
   K. A ferrimagnetic structure consisting of the uncompensated
   antiferromagnetic coupling between neighboring collinear copper and iron

Abstract = {{The use of PH3 as the P source in the growth of amorphous
   ruthenium-phosphorus (Ru(P)) alloy films by dual-source chemical vapor
   deposition (CVD) with Ru-3(CO)(12) to produce thin (similar to 3 nm) Cu
   diffusion barriers is examined. Comparisons are made to films grown
   using P(CH3)(3). Carbon contamination of 10 at.\% carbon or less was
   observed in PH3-produced Ru(P) films, compared to greater than 30 atomic
   \% carbon in films using P(CH3)(3), and lower resistivity was also
   observed. PH3 was found to be much more reactive than previously-used P
   precursors, requiring the use of very low PH3 partial pressures (similar
   to 0.13 mPa) and a sequenced addition process that allowed accumulated P
   to diffuse into the Ru(P) film during growth. X-ray reflectivity and
   atomic force microscopy indicate that films of good continuity and
   smoothness can be grown by CVD in the 3 nm thickness range. X-ray
   diffraction shows the amorphous phase to be stable for annealing at 400
   degrees C for 3 h. Electric field stress tests to failure for
   Cu/Ru(P)/SiO2/Si stacks indicate that low-carbon Ru(P) barrier films
   function at least as well as their higher-carbon counterparts as Cu

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is an attractive grid scale
   energy storage option, but high operating cost prevents widespread
   commercialization. One way of mitigating cost is to optimize system
   performance, which requires an accurate model capable of predicting cell
   voltage under different operating conditions such as current,
   temperature, flow rate, and state of charge. This paper presents a
   lumped isothermal VRFB model based on principles of mass transfer and
   electrochemical kinetics that can predict transient performance with
   respect to the aforementioned operating conditions. The model captures
   two important physical phenomena: (1) mass transfer at the electrode
   surface and (2) vanadium crossover through the membrane. Mass transfer
   effects increase the overpotential and thus reduce the battery output
   voltage during discharge. Vanadium crossover causes a concentration
   imbalance between the two half-cells that negatively affects the voltage
   response particularly after long term cycling. Further analysis on the
   system linearity is conducted to assess the feasibility of using a
   linear control design methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The classical concept of hydraulic fracturing is that a single, planar,
   opening mode fracture propagates through the formation. In recent years,
   there has been a growing consensus that natural fractures play an
   important role during stimulation in many settings. There is not
   universal agreement on the mechanisms by which natural fractures affect
   stimulation, and these mechanisms may vary depending on formation
   properties. One potentially important mechanism is shear stimulation, in
   which increased fluid pressure induces slip and permeability enhancement
   on pre-existing fractures. We propose a tendency-for-shear-stimulation
   (TSS) test as a direct, relatively unambiguous method for determining
   the degree to which shear stimulation contributes to stimulation in a
   formation. In a TSS test, fluid injection is performed while maintaining
   the bottomhole fluid pressure slightly less than the minimum principal
   stress. Under these conditions, shear stimulation is the only possible
   mechanism for permeability enhancement (except, perhaps, thermally
   induced tensile fracturing). A TSS test is different from a conventional
   procedure because injection is performed at a specified pressure (rather
   than a specified rate). With injection at a specified rate, fluid
   pressure may exceed the minimum principal stress, and it may cause
   tensile fractures to propagate through the formation. If this occurs, it
   will be ambiguous whether stimulation was because of shear stimulation
   or tensile fracturing. Maintaining pressure less than the minimum
   principal stress ensures that the effect of shear stimulation can be
   isolated. Low-rate injectivity tests could be performed before and after
   the TSS test to estimate formation permeability. An increase in
   formation permeability would indicate that shear stimulation has
   occurred. The flow-rate transient during injection may also be
   interpreted to identify shear stimulation. Numerical simulations of
   shear stimulation were performed with a discrete-fracture-network (DFN)
   simulator that couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture
   deformation. These simulations were used to qualitatively investigate
   how shear stimulation and fracture connectivity affect the results of a
   TSS test. Two specific field projects are discussed as examples of a TSS
   test, the Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) projects at Desert Peak,
   Nevada, and Soultz-sous-Forets, France.}},

Abstract = {{A recently introduced interpretation workflow has confirmed that
   inversion-based interpretation is more reliable than conventional
   well-log analysis in high-angle (HA) and horizontal (HZ) wells because
   the former accounts for well trajectory and shoulder-bed effects on well
   logs. Synthetic examples show that the inversion workflow could improve
   the estimation of hydrocarbon volumes by 15\% and 10\% in HA and HZ
   intervals, respectively. Using field examples of thinly interbedded
   calcite-cemented siltstone formations, we document results of the joint
   petrophysical inversion of logging-while-drilling multisector nuclear
   (neutron porosity, density, natural gamma ray, photoelectric factor) and
   multiarray propagation resistivity measurement for improved formation
   evaluation in HA/HZ wells. Under the assumption of multilayer formation
   petrophysical models, the inversion approach estimates formation
   properties by numerically reproducing the available measurements.
   Subsequently, inversion-derived hydrocarbon pore volume is calculated
   for assessment of reservoir pay. Application of the joint
   inversion-based interpretation in challenging field examples highlights
   petrophysical characteristics such as capillary trends or water
   saturation variations in a hydrocarbon column influenced by reservoir
   quality and formation electrical anisotropy which otherwise remain
   inconspicuous with conventional and quick-look interpretation of
   well-logs.}},

Title = {{The influence of solid ankle-foot-orthoses on forward propulsion and
   dynamic balance in healthy adults during walking}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{583-589}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: In post-stroke hemiparetic subjects, solid polypropylene
   ankle-foot-orthoses are commonly prescribed to assist in foot clearance
   during swing while bracing the ankle during stance. Mobility demands,
   such as changing walking speed and direction, are accomplished by
   accelerating or decelerating the body and maintaining dynamic balance.
   Previous studies have shown that the ankle plantarflexors are primary
   contributors to these essential biomechanical functions. Thus, with
   ankle-foot-orthoses limiting ankle motion and plantarflexor output
   during stance, execution of these walking subtasks may be compromised.
   This study examined the influence of a solid polypropylene
   ankle-foot-orthosis on forward propulsion and dynamic balance in healthy
   adults.
   Methods: Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded from 10 healthy adults
   walking with and without a unilateral ankle-foot-orthosis at
   steady-state slow (0.6 m/s) and moderate (1.2 m/s) speeds, and during
   accelerated (0-1.8 m/s at 0.06 m/s(2)) and decelerated (1.8-0 m/s at -
   0.06 m/s(2)) walking. Propulsion was quantified by propulsive and
   braking impulses (i.e., time integral of the anterior-posterior ground
   reaction force) while dynamic balance was quantified by the peak-to-peak
   range of whole-body angular momentum.
   Findings: The propulsive impulses decreased in the leg with
   ankle-foot-orthosis compared to the contralateral leg and no
   ankle-foot-orthosis condition. Further, the ankle-foot-orthosis resulted
   in a greater range of angular momentum in both the frontal and sagittal
   planes, which were correlated with the reduced peak hip abduction and
   reduced ankle plantarflexor moments, respectively.
   Interpretation: Solid ankle-foot-orthoses limit the successful execution
   of important mobility subtasks in healthy adults and that the
   prescription of ankle-foot-orthosis should be carefully considered. (C)

Abstract = {{With the advances in high power converter technologies, photovoltaic
   (PV) power has been integrated into the utility system in greater pace
   in recent years. This paper aims to provide a broad overview of the
   various grid-connected PV system configurations and their power
   converter technologies for applications in single- and three-phase
   utility power systems. Grid-connected PV systems presented include
   module-integrated, string, and centralized configurations. Single-and
   three-phase power converters discussed include full-bridge (with an
   additional switch in the DC link and back-to-back IGBT on the AC
   terminals), and neutral point clamped converters. The synchronization
   techniques for grid-connected PV applications are discussed in this
   paper. An improved method to detect the grid frequency and voltage
   magnitude for single-phase system is introduced. More importantly,
   harmonic distortions resulting from the operation of grid-connected
   photovoltaic systems are addressed and analyzed. Methods for reducing
   harmonic currents using three types of passive filters, L, LC, and LCL,
   are presented. The LCL-filter design guidelines for a specific PV system
   are presented in detail. The effectiveness of these filters is
   demonstrated on 3 kW and 50kW photovoltaic systems. (C) 2014 AIP

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Model-based design of biological parts is a critical goal of synthetic
   biology, especially for eukaryotes. Here we demonstrate that nucleosome
   architecture can have a role in defining yeast promoter activity and
   utilize a computationally-guided approach that can enable both the
   redesign of endogenous promoter sequences and the de novo design of
   synthetic promoters. Initially, we use our approach to reprogram native
   promoters for increased expression and evaluate their performance in
   various genetic contexts. Increases in expression ranging from 1.5-to
   nearly 6-fold in a plasmid-based system and up to 16-fold in a genomic
   context were obtained. Next, we demonstrate that, in a single design
   cycle, it is possible to create functional, purely synthetic yeast
   promoters that achieve substantial expression levels (within the top
   sixth percentile among native yeast promoters). In doing so, this work
   establishes a unique DNA-level specification of promoter activity and
   demonstrates predictive design of synthetic parts.}},

Abstract = {{A key element enabling the microelectronic technology advances of the
   past decades has been the conceptualization of complex circuits with
   versatile functionalities as being composed of the proper combination of
   basic `lumped' circuit elements (for example, inductors and capacitors).
   In contrast, modern nanophotonic systems are still far from a similar
   level of sophistication, partially because of the lack of modularization
   of their response in terms of basic building blocks. Here we demonstrate
   the design, assembly and characterization of relatively complex photonic
   nanocircuits by accurately positioning a number of metallic and
   dielectric nanoparticles acting as modular lumped elements. The
   nanoparticle clusters produce the desired spectral response described by
   simple circuit rules and are shown to be dynamically reconfigurable by
   modifying the direction or polarization of impinging signals. Our work
   represents an important step towards extending the powerful modular
   design tools of electronic circuits into nanophotonic systems.}},

Title = {{Spectrally selective chiral silicon metasurfaces based on infrared Fano
   resonances}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Metamaterials and metasurfaces represent a remarkably versatile platform
   for light manipulation, biological and chemical sensing, and nonlinear
   optics. Many of these applications rely on the resonant nature of
   metamaterials, which is the basis for extreme spectrally selective
   concentration of optical energy in the near field. In addition,
   metamaterial-based optical devices lend themselves to considerable
   miniaturization because of their subwavelength features. This additional
   advantage sets metamaterials apart from their predecessors, photonic
   crystals, which achieve spectral selectivity through their long-range
   periodicity. Unfortunately, spectral selectivity of the overwhelming
   majority of metamaterials that are made of metals is severely limited by
   high plasmonic losses. Here we propose and demonstrate Fano-resonant
   all-dielectric metasurfaces supporting optical resonances with quality
   factors Q > 100 that are based on CMOS-compatible materials: silicon and
   its oxide. We also demonstrate that these infrared metasurfaces exhibit
   extreme planar chirality, opening exciting possibilities for efficient
   ultrathin circular polarizers and narrow-band thermal emitters of
   circularly polarized radiation.}},

Abstract = {{In nanoparticle-augmented photothermal therapy, evaluating the delivery
   and spatial distribution of nanoparticles, followed by remote
   temperature mapping and monitoring, is essential to ensure the optimal
   therapeutic outcome. The utility of ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging
   to assist photothermal therapy has been previously demonstrated. Here,
   using a mouse xenograft tumor model, it is demonstrated in vivo that
   ultrasound-guided photoacoustic imaging can be used to plan the
   treatment and to guide the therapy. To evaluate nanoparticle delivery
   and spatial distribution, three-dimensional ultrasound and spectroscopic
   photoacoustic imaging of a mouse with a tumor was performed before and
   after intravenous injection of silica-coated gold nanorods. After
   injection and sufficient circulation of nanoparticles, photothermal
   therapy was performed for 5 min using an 808-nm continuous-wave laser.
   During the photothermal therapy, photoacoustic images were acquired
   continuously and used to measure the temperature changes within tissue.
   A heterogeneous distribution of temperature, which was spatially
   correlated with the measured distribution of nanoparticles, indicated
   that peak temperatures of 53 degrees C were achieved in the tumor. An
   Arrhenius thermal damage model determined that this thermal deposition
   would result in significant cell death. The results of this study
   suggest that ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging can effectively guide
   photothermal therapy to achieve the desired thermal treatment.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Development of efficient, affordable electrocatalysts for the oxygen
   evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction is critical for
   rechargeable metal-air batteries. Here we present lithium cobalt oxide,
   synthesized at 400 degrees C (designated as LT-LiCoO2) that adopts a
   lithiated spinel structure, as an inexpensive, efficient electrocatalyst
   for the oxygen evolution reaction. The catalytic activity of LT-LiCoO2
   is higher than that of both spinel cobalt oxide and layered lithium
   cobalt oxide synthesized at 800 degrees C (designated as HT-LiCoO2) for
   the oxygen evolution reaction. Although LT-LiCoO2 exhibits poor activity
   for the oxygen reduction reaction, the chemically delithiated
   LT-Li1-xCoO2 samples exhibit a combination of high oxygen reduction
   reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities, making the
   spinel-type LTLi0,5CoO2 a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for
   rechargeable metal-air batteries. The high activities of these
   delithiated compositions are attributed to the Co4O4 cubane subunits and
   a pinning of the Co3+/4+:3d energy with the top of the O2-:2p band.}},

Title = {{Pressure-induced semiconducting to metallic transition in multilayered
   molybdenum disulphide}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Molybdenum disulphide is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide that
   has recently raised considerable interest due to its unique
   semiconducting and opto-electronic properties. Although several
   theoretical studies have suggested an electronic phase transition in
   molybdenum disulphide, there has been a lack of experimental evidence.
   Here we report comprehensive studies on the pressure-dependent
   electronic, vibrational, optical and structural properties of
   multilayered molybdenum disulphide up to 35 GPa. Our experimental
   results reveal a structural lattice distortion followed by an electronic
   transition from a semiconducting to metallic state at similar to 19 GPa,
   which is confirmed by ab initio calculations. The metallization arises
   from the overlap of the valance and conduction bands owing to
   sulphur-sulphur interactions as the interlayer spacing reduces. The
   electronic transition affords modulation of the opto-electronic gain in
   molybdenum disulphide. This pressure-tuned behaviour can enable the
   development of novel devices with multiple phenomena involving the
   strong coupling of the mechanical, electrical and optical properties of
   layered nanomaterials.}},

   thin films formed via atomic layer deposition (ALD). Combined Rutherford
   backscattering and nuclear reaction analysis measurements show that ALD
   BeO thin films exhibit a low hydrogen content (<5\%) and are nearly
   stoichiometric (Be/O congruent to 1.1 +/- 0.05). Reflection electron
   energy loss spectroscopy measurements reveal a wide band gap of 8.0 +/-

Abstract = {{The inherent fault-masking characteristic of the traditional loopback
   test produces overly pessimistic estimates of device-under-test (DUT)
   performance, which negatively impacts product yield, although the
   loopback test provides a promising low-cost test solution. The proposed
   method overcomes the fault-masking shortcomings of the loopback test for
   single-ended mixed-signal circuits by accurately characterizing the
   performance parameters of the individual DUTs, based on the imbalance
   generation technique of our previous work. Basically, the proposed
   method is the case study of the previous work to validate the
   expansibility to a single-ended circuit testing. A sinusoidal stimulus
   is applied to the DUT, and our loopback configuration converts the
   external single-ended loopback path to differential mode, in order to
   generate the phase imbalance between the differential pair. The
   imbalanced differential signals then switch back to a single-ended mode
   and stimulate the DUT, in order to introduce the DUT loopback responses
   of different weight. The nonlinear characteristic equations are then
   derived to characterize the individual DUT performances. Hardware
   measurements show that our cost-effective test approach can accurately
   predict DUT performance parameters.}},

Abstract = {{PERK, as one of the principle unfolded protein response signal
   transducers, is believed to be associated with many human diseases, such

   discover potent PERK inhibitors due to its potential therapeutic

   employed to discover novel PERK inhibitors, followed by experimental
   validation. Using a focused library, we show that a consensus approach,
   combining pharmacophore modeling and docking, can be more cost-effective
   than using either approach alone. It is also demonstrated that the
   conformational flexibility near the active site is an important
   consideration in structure-based docking and can be addressed by using
   molecular dynamics. The consensus approach has further been applied to
   screen the ZINC lead-like database, resulting in the identification of
   10 active compounds, two of which show IC50 values that are less than 10
   mu M in a dose-response assay.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of endogenous gene expression is a fundamental operation of
   metabolic engineering, yet current methods for gene knockdown (i.e.,
   genome editing) remain laborious and slow, especially in yeast. In
   contrast, RNA interference allows facile and tunable gene knockdown via
   a simple plasmid transformation step, enabling metabolic engineers to
   rapidly prototype knockdown strategies in multiple strains before
   expending significant cost to undertake genome editing. Although RNAi is
   naturally present in a myriad of eukaryotes, it has only been recently
   implemented in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a heterologous pathway and so
   has not yet been optimized as a metabolic engineering tool. In this
   study, we elucidate a set of design principles for the construction of
   hairpin RNA expression cassettes in yeast and implement RNA interference
   to quickly identify routes for improvement of itaconic acid production
   in this organism. The approach developed here enables rapid prototyping
   of knockdown strategies and thus accelerates and reduces the cost of the

Abstract = {{This paper examines rich and ultrarich combustion of methanol and
   ethanol in a porous media reactor with an external heat exchanger to
   vaporize liquid fuels and recover combustion energy. Temperature,
   velocities, and chemical products of the combustion waves were recorded
   experimentally at a range of equivalence ratios from phi = 1.6 to 8.2
   and oxygen content in the oxidizer from 10 to 23\%. Experimental results
   show that the reactor can handle ultrarich combustion up to an
   equivalence ratio of 8.2 and obtained maximum conversion of hydrogen of
   43 and 30\% for methanol and ethanol, respectively. A high oxygen
   content in the oxidizer results in higher hydrogen and carbon monoxide
   concentrations. Conclusions show that the reactor for filtration
   combustion can be used to reform liquid fuels into hydrogen and syngas.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is potentially a very attractive
   alternative to CMOS for future digital designs. Circuit designs in QCA
   have been extensively studied. However, how to properly evaluate the QCA
   circuits has not been carefully considered. To date, metrics and
   area-delay cost functions directly mapped from CMOS technology have been
   used to compare QCA designs, which is inappropriate due to the
   differences between these two technologies. In this paper, several cost
   metrics specifically aimed at QCA circuits are studied. It is found that
   delay, the number of QCA logic gates, and the number and type of
   crossovers, are important metrics that should be considered when
   comparing QCA designs. A family of new cost functions for QCA circuits
   is proposed. As fundamental components in QCA computing arithmetic, QCA
   adders are reviewed and evaluated with the proposed cost functions. By
   taking the new cost metrics into account, previous best adders become
   unattractive and it has been shown that different optimization goals
   lead to different ``best{''} adders.}},

Abstract = {{Micromachined microphones with grating-based optical-interferometric
   readout have been demonstrated previously. These microphones are similar
   in construction to bottom-inlet capacitive microelectromechanical-system
   (MEMS) microphones, with the exception that optoelectronic emitters and
   detectors are placed inside the microphone's front or back cavity. A
   potential advantage of optical microphones in designing for low noise
   level is the use of highly-perforated microphone backplates to enable
   low-damping and low thermal-mechanical noise levels. This work presents
   an experimental study of a microphone diaphragm and backplate designed
   for optical readout and low thermal-mechanical noise. The backplate is 1
   mm x 1 mm and is fabricated in a 2-mu m-thick epitaxial silicon layer of
   a silicon-on-insulator wafer and contains a diffraction grating with
   4-mu m pitch etched at the center. The presented system has a measured
   thermal-mechanical noise level equal to 22.6 dBA. Through measurement of
   the electrostatic frequency response and measured noise spectra, a
   device model for the microphone system is verified. The model is in-turn
   used to identify design paths towards MEMS microphones with sub 15-dBA
   noise floors. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Although chemically inert nanosize mineral fillers have been shown to
   modify early cement hydration kinetics, with the effects dependent upon
   usage rate, particle size, and dispersibility, the effects of such
   fillers on the apparent activation energy (E-a) of cement has not been
   previously examined. Here, cement E-a was calculated from isothermal
   calorimetry performed at different temperatures with two different types
   of fillers (i.e., titanium dioxide and limestone) using a linear method
   as well as a modified ASTM C1074 method. The use of both types of
   nanoparticles increased the rate of cement hydration as well as
   accelerated the reaction rate, due to heterogeneous nucleation effect,
   as previously demonstrated. E-a increased in the presence of nanosized
   fillers, demonstrating an increased temperature sensitivity of the
   filler-cement composites relative to ordinary cement. These results show
   that chemically inert nanoparticles behave fundamentally differently
   compared with supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and
   silica fume which instead decrease temperature sensitivity. The
   increased temperature sensitivity could thus be used to modify and
   optimize the reaction mechanism and kinetics of cement hydration,
   especially to increase the rate of cement hydration, to decrease setting
   time, and to achieve faster strength gain accounting for higher or lower
   temperatures during curing.}},

   the highest pore density for lithium-ion insertion/extraction. The
   LiFePO4 nanosheets show a high specific capacity at low charge/discharge

Abstract = {{Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators, because the
   amorphous arrangement of the molecular chains reduces the mean free path
   of heat-conducting phonons. The most common method to increase thermal
   conductivity is to draw polymeric fibres, which increases chain
   alignment and crystallinity, but creates a material that currently has
   limited thermal applications. Here we show that pure polythiophene
   nanofibres can have a thermal conductivity up to similar to 4.4 W
   m(-1)K(-1) (more than 20 times higher than the bulk polymer value) while
   remaining amorphous. This enhancement results from significant molecular
   chain orientation along the fibre axis that is obtained during
   electropolymerization using nanoscale templates. Thermal conductivity
   data suggest that, unlike in drawn crystalline fibres, in our fibres the
   dominant phonon-scattering process at room temperature is still related
   to structural disorder. Using vertically aligned arrays of nanofibres,
   we demonstrate effective heat transfer at critical contacts in
   electronic devices operating under high-power conditions at 200 degrees
   C over numerous cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable systems that monitor muscle activity, store data and deliver
   feedback therapy are the next frontier in personalized medicine and
   healthcare. However, technical challenges, such as the fabrication of
   high-performance, energy-efficient sensors and memory modules that are
   in intimate mechanical contact with soft tissues, in conjunction with
   controlled delivery of therapeutic agents, limit the wide-scale adoption
   of such systems. Here, we describe materials, mechanics and designs for
   multifunctional, wearable-on-the-skin systems that address these
   challenges via monolithic integration of nanomembranes fabricated with a
   top-down approach, nanoparticles assembled by bottom-up methods, and
   stretchable electronics on a tissue-like polymeric substrate.
   Representative examples of such systems include physiological sensors,
   non-volatile memory and drug-release actuators. Quantitative analyses of
   the electronics, mechanics, heat-transfer and drug-diffusion
   characteristics validate the operation of individual components, thereby
   enabling system-level multifunctionalities.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method to utilize colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as a swept
   light source for hyperspectral microscopy. The use of QD allows for
   uniform multicolor emission which covers visible-NIR wavelengths. We
   used 8 colors of CdSe/ZnS and CdTe/ZnS colloidal quantum dots with the
   peak emission wavelengths from 520 nm to 800 nm. The QDs are packed in a
   compact enclosure, composing a low-cost, solid-state swept light source
   that can be easily used in most microscopes. Multicolor emission from
   the QDs is simply controlled by digitally switching excitation UVLEDs,
   eliminating the use of mechanically-driven gratings or filters. We used
   gold nanoparticles as optical markers for hyperspectral microscopy. Due
   to the effect of localized surface plasmon resonance, gold nanoparticles
   demonstrate size and shape-dependent absorption spectra. Employed in a
   standard microscope, the QD light source enabled multispectral
   absorption imaging of macrophage cells labeled with gold nanorods and
   nanospheres. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Circadian cognitive and physical rhythms plus 24 h patterns of accidents
   and work-related injuries (WRI) have been verified in numerous studies.
   However, rarely, if ever, have 24 h temporal differences in both work
   performance and risk of WRI been assessed in the same group of workers.
   We explored in a homogenous group of French firemen (FM) 24 h patterns
   of both lag time (LT) response duration to emergency calls for medical
   help (ECFM) for life-threatening out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA),
   used as a non-specific index of work performance, and WRI. Our studies
   demonstrate rather high amplitude statistically significant 24 h
   patterns of the two variables. The LT response duration was twice as
   long similar to 0500 h (slowest response) than similar to 1600 h
   (fastest response). In the same group of FM, the actual number WRI/h was
   greatest similar to 1600 h and lowest in the early morning hours.
   However, the 24 h pattern of the relative risk (RR) of WRIs, i.e., per
   clock hour number of WRI/(total number of responses to emergency calls x
   number of FM at risk per response), was very different, the RR being
   greatest similar to 0200 h and lowest in the afternoon. The 24 h pattern
   in LT response duration to ECMH for OHCA and RR of WRI was strongly
   correlated (r=+0.85, P<0.01), with the nocturnal trough (slowest
   response) in LT response duration coinciding with the nocturnal peak RR
   of WRI. These findings indicate the requirement for circadian
   rhythm-based interventions to improve the nocturnal compromised work
   performance and elevated risk of WRI of shift-working FM.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{42-58}},

Abstract = {{Thermomechanical properties of monolayer graphene with thermal
   fluctuation are studied by both statistical mechanics analysis and
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the statistical mechanics
   analysis in the present study is limited by a harmonic approximation,
   significant anharmonic effects are revealed by MD simulations. The
   amplitude of out-of-plane thermal fluctuation is calculated for graphene
   membranes under both zero stress and zero strain conditions. It is found
   that the fluctuation amplitude follows a power-law scaling with respect
   to the linear dimension of the membrane, but the roughness exponents are
   different for the two conditions due to anharmonic interactions between
   bending and stretching modes. Such thermal fluctuation or rippling is
   found to be responsible for the effectively negative in-plane thermal
   expansion of graphene at relatively low temperatures, while a transition
   to positive thermal expansion is predicted as the anharmonic
   interactions suppress the rippling effect at high temperatures. Subject
   to equi-biaxial tension, the amplitude of thermal rippling decreases
   nonlinearly, and the in-plane stress-strain relation of graphene becomes
   nonlinear even at infinitesimal strain, in contrast with classical
   theory of linear elasticity. It is found that the tangent biaxial
   modulus of graphene depends on strain non-monotonically, decreases with
   increasing temperature, and depends on membrane size. Both statistical
   mechanics and MD simulations suggest considerable entropic contribution
   to the thermomechanical properties of graphene, and as a result thermal
   rippling is intricately coupled with thermal expansion and
   thermoelasticity for monolayer graphene membranes. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new econometric formulation and an associated

   observed conditional on a participation selection system that takes a
   multiple discrete-continuous model structure. This leads to a joint
   model system of a multivariate count and a multiple discrete-continuous
   selection system in a hurdle-type model. The model is applied to analyze
   the participation and time investment of households in out-of-home
   activities by activity purpose, along with the frequency of
   participation in each selected activity. The results suggest that the
   number of episodes of activities as well as the time investment in those
   activities may be more of a lifestyle- and lifecycle-driven choice than
   one related to the availability of opportunities for activity
   participation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report the development of a parallel electrocatalyst screening
   platform for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using bipolar
   electrodes (BPEs). Electrocatalyst candidates are subjected to screening
   in a N-2-purged bipolar electrochemical cell where a pair of driving
   electrodes produce an electric field in the electrolyte solution. The
   HER occurring at the BPE cathodes is electrically coupled to the
   electrodissolution of an array of Cr microbands present at the BPE
   anodes. The readout of this device is simple, where the species that
   dissolve the most Cr microbands are identified as the most promising
   electrocatalyst candidates for further evaluation. We demonstrate the
   utility of this technique by comparing several bi- and trimetallic
   systems involving Co, Fe, Ni, Mo, and W, which are compared directly
   with pure Pt. Of all the compositions tested, Ni-8-Mo-2 is demonstrated
   to be the most active for the HER in a neutral electrolyte solution.}},

Title = {{A Repair Framework for Scalar MDS Codes}},

Abstract = {{Several works have developed vector-linear maximum-distance separable
   (MDS) storage codes that minimize the total communication cost required
   to repair a single coded symbol after an erasure, referred to as repair
   bandwidth (BW). Vector codes allow communicating fewer sub-symbols per
   node, instead of the entire content. This allows non trivial savings in
   repair BW. In sharp contrast, classic codes, like Reed-Solomon (RS),
   used in current storage systems, are deemed to suffer from naive repair,
   i.e. downloading the entire stored message to repair one failed node.
   This mainly happens because they are scalar-linear.
   In this work, we present a simple framework that treats scalar codes as
   vector-linear. In some cases, this allows significant savings in repair
   BW. We show that vectorized scalar codes exhibit properties that
   simplify the design of repair schemes. Our framework can be seen as a
   finite field analogue of real interference alignment.
   Using our simplified framework, we design a scheme that we call
   clique-repair which provably identifies the best linear repair strategy
   for any scalar 2-parity MDS code, under some conditions on the sub-field
   chosen for vectorization. We specify optimal repair schemes for specific
   (5, 3)- and (6, 4)-Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Further, we present a repair
   strategy for the RS code currently deployed in the Facebook Analytics
   Hadoop cluster that leads to 20\% of repair BW savings over naive repair
   which is the repair scheme currently used for this code.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new family of Fountain codes that are systematic and also
   have sparse parities. Given an input of k symbols, our codes produce an
   unbounded number of output symbols, generating each parity independently
   by linearly combining a logarithmic number of randomly selected input
   symbols. The construction guarantees that for any epsilon > 0 accessing
   a random subset of (1 + epsilon) k encoded symbols, asymptotically
   suffices to recover the k input symbols with high probability.
   Our codes have the additional benefit of logarithmic locality: a single
   lost symbol can be repaired by accessing a subset of O(log k) of the
   remaining encoded symbols. This is a desired property for distributed
   storage systems where symbols are spread over a network of storage
   nodes. Beyond recovery upon loss, local reconstruction provides an
   efficient alternative for reading symbols that cannot be accessed
   directly. In our code, a logarithmic number of disjoint local groups is
   associated with each systematic symbol, allowing multiple parallel
   reads.
   Our main mathematical contribution involves analyzing the rank of sparse
   random matrices with specific structure over finite fields. We rely on
   establishing that a new family of sparse random bipartite graphs have
   perfect matchings with high probability.}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The program evaluation and review technique (PERT) is a popular method
   for measuring and controlling activity progress in projects. Its
   structure is simple, and the result is fairly accurate as long as none
   of its base assumptions is violated. Many authors have challenged these
   assumptions and suggested improvements to the mean and variance
   formulas. This paper quantifies the accuracy of a wide range of PERT
   mean-variance estimation formulas. In addition, we develop a new PERT
   variant using common percentiles. The proposed method uses three points
   for estimation, just like the classical PERT. However, it provides
   options for the selection of the three points. It provides different set
   of probability weights by the selection of the three points and what
   parameter to estimate, i.e., mean or variance, which minimizes the
   estimation error. We compare the accuracy of our approach with existing
   methods using the Pearson distribution system. Our use of the Pearson
   system allows us to systematically compare different PERT methods over a
   wider range of distribution shapes than has previously been considered.
   This analysis shows that, despite its simple structure, our new method
   outperforms existing methods when estimating means and variances of most
   bell-shaped and J-shaped beta distributions. We also demonstrate how
   practitioners could use our new methods in actual project settings.}},

   permanent faults. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and proved out

Abstract = {{This paper provides a new switching angular velocity observer
   formulation to the classical problem of rigid-body attitude tracking
   control in the absence of angular rate measurements. Exponential
   convergence of the angular velocity state estimation errors is proven
   using a novel error signal definition through the use of this
   switching-type observer. The observer synthesis and convergence
   properties are independent of controller design. The switching ensures
   C-0 continuity for all the estimated states. Further, the maximum number
   of switches required by the observer is shown to be finite and that
   zeno-type behavior cannot occur. A ``separation-property{''} type result
   for the attitude tracking problem is established, wherein a
   proportional-derivative controller uses angular velocity estimates from
   the proposed switching observer in the absence of actual angular rate
   measurements, while ensuring almost global asymptotic stability for the
   overall closed-loop tracking error dynamics. The separation property is
   also proven to hold when a gyroscopic nonlinear compensation term is

   nanocrystals. The balance between activation and compensation of dopants
   limits the free carrier concentration of the most common metal oxides,
   placing a ceiling on the LSPR frequency. Furthermore, because of ionized
   impurity scattering of the oscillating plasma by dopant ions, scattering
   must be treated in a fundamentally different way in semiconductor metal
   oxide materials when compared with conventional metals. Though these
   effects are well-understood in bulk metal oxides, further study is
   needed to understand their manifestation in nanocrystals and
   corresponding impact on plasmonic properties, and to develop materials
   that surpass current limitations in free carrier concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Antibodies capable of neutralizing HIV-1 often target variable regions 1
   and 2 (V1V2) of the HIV-1 envelope, but the mechanism of their
   elicitation has been unclear. Here we define the developmental pathway
   by which such antibodies are generated and acquire the requisite
   molecular characteristics for neutralization. Twelve somatically related
   neutralizing antibodies (CAP256-VRC26.01-12) were isolated from donor
   CAP256 (from the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South
   Africa (CAPRISA)); each antibody contained the protruding
   tyrosine-sulphated, anionic antigen-binding loop
   (complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3) characteristic of this
   category of antibodies. Their unmutated ancestor emerged between weeks
   30-38 post-infection with a 35-residue CDR H3, and neutralized the virus
   that superinfected this individual 15 weeks after initial infection.
   Improved neutralization breadth and potency occurred by week 59 with
   modest affinity maturation, and was preceded by extensive
   diversification of the virus population. HIV-1 V1V2-directed
   neutralizing antibodies can thus develop relatively rapidly through
   initial selection of B cells with a long CDR H3, and limited subsequent
   somatic hypermutation. These data provide important insights relevant to
   HIV-1 vaccine development.}},

Title = {{Reduced-order residential home modeling for model predictive control}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{69-77}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Building simulation softWare packages such as EnergyPlus are useful
   energy modeling tools. These software packages, however, are often not
   amenable to model-based control due to model complexity or difficulties
   connecting control algorithms with the software. We present a method for
   automatically generating input/output data from an EnergyPlus
   residential home model using the OpenStudio software suite. These
   input/output data are used to create a simple reduced-order model that
   can be evaluated in fractions of a second. The reduced-order model is
   implemented in a model predictive controller to minimize the home's
   electricity costs during summer months in Austin, Texas, USA. The
   controller optimally precools the home in the morning and turns down or
   off the air conditioning system in the afternoon. For this example,
   electricity prices were taken from actual market prices in the Austin
   area. The optimal precooling strategy given by the model predictive
   controller reduces peak energy consumption from the air conditioning
   unit by an average of 70\% and reduces operating costs by 60\%.
   Precooling, however, consumes more total energy versus not precooling.
   Reducing peak energy consumption by 1 kWh results, on average, in an
   increase of 0.63 kWh in overall energy consumption. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The built environment can be used to influence travel demand, but very
   few studies consider the relative energy savings of such policies in
   context of a complex urban system. This analysis quantifies the
   day-today and embodied energy consumption of four different
   neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, to examine how built environment
   variations influence various sources of urban energy consumption. A
   microsimulation combines models for petroleum use (from driving) and
   residential and commercial power and natural gas use with rigorously
   measured building stock and infrastructure materials quantities (to
   arrive at embodied energy). Results indicate that the more suburban
   neighborhoods, with mostly detached single-family homes, consume up to
   320\% more embodied energy, 150\% more operational energy, and about
   160\% more total life-cycle energy (per capita) than a densely developed
   neighborhoods with mostly low-rise-apartments and duplexes. Across all
   neighborhoods, operational energy use comprised 83 to 92\% of total
   energy use, and transportation sources (including personal vehicles and
   transit, plus street, parking structure, and sidewalk infrastructure)
   made up 44 to 47\% of the life-cycle energy demands tallied. Energy
   elasticity calculations across the neighborhoods suggest that increased
   population density and reduced residential unit size offer greatest
   life-cycle energy savings per capita, by reducing both operational
   demands from driving and home energy use, and from less embodied energy
   from construction. These results provide measurable metrics for
   comparing different neighborhood styles and develop a framework to
   anticipate energy-savings from changes in the built environment versus
   household energy efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Silent cerebral ischemia (SCI) has been reported in 14\% of
   cases after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) with
   radiofrequency (RF) energy and discontinuation of warfarin before AF
   ablation procedures.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine whether
   periprocedural anticoagulation management affects the incidence of SCI
   after RF ablation using an open irrigated catheter.
   METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing RF ablation for AF without
   warfarin discontinuation and receiving heparin bolus before transseptal
   catheterization (group I, n = 146) were compared with a group of
   patients who had protocol deviation in terms of maintaining the
   therapeutic preprocedural international normalized ratio (patients with
   subtherapeutic INR) and/or failure to receive pre-transseptal heparin
   bolus infusion and/or >= 2 consecutive ACT measurements < 300 seconds
   (noncompliant population, group II, n = 134) and with a group of
   patients undergoing RF ablation with warfarin discontinuation bridged
   with low molecular weight heparin (group III, n = 148). All patients
   underwent preablation and postablation (within 48 hours) diffusion
   magnetic resonance imaging.
   RESULTS SCI was detected in 2\% of patients (3/146) in group I, 7\%
   (10/134) in group II, and 14\% (21/148) in group III (P <.001).
   ``Therapeutic INR{''} was strongly associated with a lower prevalence of
   postprocedural silent cerebral ischemia (SCI). Multivariable analysis
   demonstrated nonparoxysmal AF (odds ratio 3.8, 95\% confidence interval
   1.5-9.7, P = .005) and noncompliance to protocol(odds ratio 2.8, 95\%
   confidence interval 1.5-5.1, P <.001] to be significant predictors of
   ischemic events.
   CONCLUSION Strict adherence to an anticoagulation protocol significantly
   reduces the prevalence of SCI after catheter ablation of AF with RF
   energy.}},

Abstract = {{Integer least-squares problems, concerned with solving a system of
   equations where the components of the unknown vector are integer-valued,
   arise in a wide range of applications. In many scenarios the unknown
   vector is sparse, i.e., a large fraction of its entries are zero.
   Examples include applications in wireless communications, digital
   fingerprinting, and array-comparative genomic hybridization systems.
   Sphere decoding, commonly used for solving integer least-squares
   problems, can utilize the knowledge about sparsity of the unknown vector
   to perform computationally efficient search for the solution. In this
   paper, we formulate and analyze the sparsity-aware sphere decoding
   algorithm that imposes l(0)-norm constraint on the admissible solution.
   Analytical expressions for the expected complexity of the algorithm for
   alphabets typical of sparse channel estimation and source allocation
   applications are derived and validated through extensive simulations.
   The results demonstrate superior performance and speed of sparsity-aware
   sphere decoder compared to the conventional sparsity-unaware sphere
   decoding algorithm. Moreover, variance of the complexity of the
   sparsity-aware sphere decoding algorithm for binary alphabets is
   derived. The search space of the proposed algorithm can be further
   reduced by imposing lower bounds on the value of the objective function.
   The algorithm is modified to allow for such a lower bounding technique
   and simulations illustrating efficacy of the method are presented.
   Performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in an application to sparse
   channel estimation, where it is shown that sparsity-aware sphere decoder
   performs close to theoretical lower limits.}},

Abstract = {{Despite long-standing awareness of adverse health effects associated
   with chronic human exposure to formaldehyde, this hazardous air
   pollutant remains a challenge to measure in indoor environments.
   Traditional analytical techniques evaluate formaldehyde concentrations
   over several hours to several days in a single location in a residence,
   making it difficult to characterize daily temporal and spatial variation
   in human exposure to formaldehyde. There is a need for portable,
   easy-to-use devices that are specific and sensitive to gas-phase
   formaldehyde over short sampling periods so that dynamic processes
   governing formaldehyde fate, transport, and potential remediation in
   indoor environments may be studied more effectively. A recently
   developed device couples a chemical sensor element with
   spectrophotonnetric analysis for detection and quantification of part
   per billion (ppb(v)) gas-phase formaldehyde concentrations. This study
   established the ability of the coupled sensor-spectrophotometric device
   (CSSD) to report formaldehyde concentrations accurately and continuously
   on a 30-min sampling cycle at low ppbv concentrations previously
   untested for this device in a laboratory setting. Determination of the
   method detection limit (MDL), based on 40 samples each at test
   concentrations of 5 and 10 ppb(v), was found to be 1.9 and 2.0 ppb(v),
   respectively. Performance of the CSSD was compared with the
   dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatization method for formaldehyde
   concentrations ranging from 5-50 ppb(v), and a linear relationship with
   a coefficient of determination of 0.983 was found between these two
   analytical techniques. The CSSD was also used to monitor indoor
   formaldehyde concentrations in two manufactured homes. During this time,
   formaldehyde concentrations varied from below detection limit to 65 ppbv
   and were above the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and
   Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) of 16 ppb(v) which is
   also the exposure limit value now adopted by the US Federal Emergency
   Management Agency (FEMA) to procure manufactured housing, 80\% and 100\%
   of the time, respectively.}},

Title = {{Empirical Study on the Key Drivers Affecting Durations for Right-of-Way
   Acquisition on Highway Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Right-of-way (R/W) acquisition, one of the most basic of preconstruction
   activities on a highway project, is an important subject by many state
   DOTs because the failure to make timely acquisitions of R/W causes
   significant delays and conflicts. Various management practices and
   strategies have been designed and implemented to deliver R/W acquisition
   on schedule but completing this preconstruction process is still not an
   easy activity for many state DOTs. The Texas DOT (TXDOT) is no
   exception. The research reported in this paper has identified all
   drivers that can be considered influential in the determination of
   durations for R/W acquisition; it was undertaken to improve the R/W
   duration-prediction capabilities of practitioners involved in regional
   districts of TXDOT. In the research process, each driver's importance
   level was evaluated by such practitioners. The practitioners, all of
   whom had different levels of accuracy at estimating durations, showed
   significantly different perceptions of the identified duration-drivers.
   Based on this observation, the research reported in this paper suggests
   that all drivers which show such significantly different levels of
   importance should be determined when predicting durations for R/W
   acquisition in a project's early-planning phase. The research reported
   in this paper demonstrates that determining the influential drivers is
   critical to accurately estimate durations for R/W acquisition on highway
   projects.}},

Title = {{Network Model for Rural Roadway Tolling with Pavement Deterioration and
   Repair}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{The objective of roadway tolling in rural areas is often tied to revenue
   generation for roadway maintenance. Thus, rural pricing models should
   directly incorporate a pavement deterioration and maintenance model.
   However, the interactions between these models are not simple, because
   tolls cause traffic diversion, which in turn affects deterioration rates
   and forecasted revenue. This article describes a rural pricing model
   which calculates diversion endogenously with a network assignment model.
   This model captures deterioration rates and pavement condition in the
   toll-setter's objective function, maximizing long-run net present value
   of the highway infrastructure. A novel deterioration model is used which
   is particularly suitable for computational efficiency. The resulting
   model is discontinuous and nondifferentiable, and involves solving a
   combinatorial knapsack problem as a subproblem. Thus, a simulated
   annealing-based algorithm is presented to solve it, in the framework of
   a new solution method built upon partitioning the feasible region. A
   demonstration is made using a network representing the state of Wyoming
   (28 zones, 60 nodes, and 188 links). Sensitivity analyses reveal that
   although the locations for optimal tolling are relatively stable as
   demand changes, the revenue collected can vary substantially. Relatively
   simple models are used throughout for computational reasons, and future
   research should investigate strategies for incorporating more advanced
   pavement and network models.}},
