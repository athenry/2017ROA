Abstract = {{Phase retrieval problems involve solving linear equations, but with
   missing sign ( or phase, for complex numbers) information. More than
   four decades after it was first proposed, the seminal error reduction
   algorithm of Gerchberg and Saxton and Fienup is still the popular choice
   for solving many variants of this problem. The algorithm is based on
   alternating minimization; i.e., it alternates between estimating the
   missing phase information, and the candidate solution. Despite its wide
   usage in practice, no global convergence guarantees for this algorithm
   are known. In this paper, we show that a (resampling) variant of this
   approach converges geometrically to the solution of one such
   problem-finding a vector x from y, A where y = vertical bar A (T) x
   vertical bar and vertical bar z broken vertical bar denotes a vector of
   element-wise magnitudes of z-under the assumption that is Gaussian.
   Empirically, we demonstrate that alternating minimization performs
   similar to recently proposed convex techniques for this problem (which
   are based on ``lifting{''} to a convex matrix problem) in sample
   complexity and robustness to noise. However, it is much more efficient
   and can scale to large problems. Analytically, for a resampling version
   of alternating minimization, we show geometric convergence to the
   solution, and sample complexity that is off by log factors from obvious
   lower bounds. We also establish close to optimal scaling for the case
   when the unknown vector is sparse. Our work represents the first
   theoretical guarantee for alternating minimization (albeit with
   resampling) for any variant of phase retrieval problems in the
   non-convex setting.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{278-288}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Mixing is one of the most important processes for producing concrete.
   The influence of different mixing methods on the theological properties
   and fresh state microstructure of cement pastes were evaluated. In this
   work, the mixing process of cement paste was based on two different
   sample preparation methods: ASTM C305 and ASTM C1738. ASTM C1738 uses a
   high shear mixer, whereas ASTM C305 uses a planetary mixer to homogenize
   cement paste. A considerable increase in the theological properties was
   seen in pastes prepared using the ASTM C1738 protocol versus those
   prepared according to ASTM C305, especially when a superplasticizer was
   incorporated. Not only were the rheological properties affected, but
   differences in hydration kinetics and fresh state microstructure were
   also observed, with mixtures prepared with ASTM C1738 generally
   displaying more flocculated microstructural features and accelerated
   hydration kinetics than mixtures prepared with ASTM C305. (C) 2015

Volume = {{297}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Textural equilibrium controls the distribution of the liquid phase in
   many naturally occurring porous materials such as partially molten rocks
   and alloys, salt-brine and ice-water systems. In these materials, pore
   geometry evolves to minimize the solid-liquid interfacial energy while
   maintaining a constant dihedral angle,., at solid-liquid contact lines.
   We present a level set method to compute an implicit representation of
   the liquid-solid interface in textural equilibrium with space-filling
   tessellations of multiple solid grains in three dimensions. Each grain
   is represented by a separate level set function and interfacial energy
   minimization is achieved by evolving the solid-liquid interface under
   surface diffusion to constant mean curvature surface. The liquid volume
   and dihedral angle constraints are added to the formulation using
   virtual convective and normal velocity terms. This results in an initial
   value problem for a system of non-linear coupled PDEs governing the
   evolution of the level sets for each grain, using the implicit
   representation of the solid grains as initial condition. A domain
   decomposition scheme is devised to restrict the computational domain of
   each grain to few grid points around the grain. The coupling between the
   interfaces is achieved in a higher level on the original computational
   domain. The spatial resolution of the discretization is improved through
   high-order spatial differentiation schemes and localization of
   computations through domain composition. Examples of three-dimensional
   solutions are also obtained for different grain distributions networks
   that illustrate the geometric flexibility of the method. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{118}},

Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{The development of microwave plasma streamers at 110 GHz in atmospheric
   pressure air is numerically investigated taking into account the intense
   gas heating and its effects on the plasma formation and dynamics. The
   simulations are based on an implicit finite difference time domain
   formulation of Maxwell's equations coupled with a simple plasma fluid
   model and a real gas Euler equation solver. The numerical results show
   how the formation of a shock wave due to the large microwave power
   absorbed by the plasma and converted into gas heating strongly modifies
   the streamer elongation and dynamics. A microwave streamer filament
   stretches along its axis because of ionization-diffusion mechanisms in
   the enhanced electric field at the streamer tips. The change in the gas
   density distribution associated with the formation of shock wave due to
   gas heating strongly modifies the ionization and diffusion mechanisms
   and tends to limit the on-axis microwave streamer elongation by
   enhancing resonance effects. The simulations suggest that gas heating
   effects also play an important role in the observed bending or branching
   of microwave streamers after they have reached a critical length. (C)

Abstract = {{Extraordinary optical transmissions through metallic films with arrays
   of subwavelength holes have attracted much attention in the past few
   years, and surface plasmons are accepted as the key factor in their
   origin. Further studies showed that the abilities of surface plasmons
   can also be extended to achieve light collimation. Here, we show that
   collective surface oscillation can also occur in acoustics, and
   different from previous reports, we demonstrate that extraordinary
   acoustic transmissions and sound collimation can be achieved when the
   wavelength is much longer than the characteristic length of the sample.
   The excitation and detection approaches of the acoustic surface
   oscillation are also presented. Our findings should open up prospects
   for acoustic applications, and many exotic optical phenomena related to

   nanograting, based on a metal-dielectric-metal plasmonic waveguide, aims
   to enhance the light intensity through the resonant reflection of

Abstract = {{We employ a real-space pseudopotential method to compute the structural
   energies of a prototypical metal-semiconductor interface. Specifically,
   we examine a Pb(111) film overlaid on a Si(111) substrate as a function
   of the metal thickness. For each layer of Pb, we fully relax the atomic
   coordinates and determine the lowest-energy structure. Owing to the
   lattice mismatch between the Pb and Si crystal structures, we consider a
   large supercell containing up to 1505 atoms for the largest system.
   Systems of this size remain challenging for most current computational
   approaches and require algorithms specifically designed for highly
   parallel computational platforms. We examine the structural properties
   of the interface with respect to the thickness of the metal overlayer,
   e.g., the corrugation of the profile of the Pb overlayer. The combined
   influence of the Si substrate and quantum confinement results in a rich
   profile for a transition between a thin overlayer (less than a few
   monolayers), where the corrugation is strong, and the bulk region (more
   than a half-dozen layers), where the overlaid Pb film is atomically
   flat. This work proves the feasibility of handling systems with such a
   level of complexity.}},

Abstract = {{A self-assembled MoSe2 nanolayers/reduced graphene oxide (MoSe2/rGO)
   foam was prepared using a hydrothermal method. The samples were
   systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction, field emission
   scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical
   performances were evaluated in two-electrode cells versus metallic
   lithium. It is demonstrated that the obtained MoSe2/rGO nanocomposites
   show three-dimensional architecture and excellent electrochemical
   performance as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. The specific
   capacity of MoSe2/rGO anode can reach up to 650 mAh g(-1) at a current
   rate of 0.1C in the voltage range 0.01-3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+), which is
   higher than the theoretical capacity of MoSe2 (422 mAh g(-1)).
   Additionally, the fabricated half cells have shown good rate capability
   and long cycling stability with 10.9\% capacity loss after 600 cycles
   under a current density of 0.5C. The excellent performance of the
   synthesized MoSe2/rGO is attributed to its unique nanostructure,
   including nanolayered MoSe2, highly conductive rGO networks and
   mechanically stable 3D architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Immune Repertoire Mining}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing evolution of Ebolaviruses poses significant challenges to
   the development of immunodiagnostics for detecting emergent viral
   variants. There is a critical need for the discovery of monoclonal
   antibodies with distinct affinities and specificities for different
   Ebolaviruses. We developed an efficient technology for the rapid
   discovery of a plethora of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies from
   immunized animals by mining the VH: VL paired antibody repertoire
   encoded by highly expanded B cells in the draining popliteal lymph node
   (PLN). This approach requires neither screening nor selection for
   antigen-binding. Specifically we show that mouse immunization with Ebola
   VLPs gives rise to a highly polarized antibody repertoire in CD138(+)
   antibody-secreting cells within the PLN. All highly expanded antibody
   clones (7/7 distinct clones/animal) were expressed recombinantly, and
   shown to recognize the VLPs used for immunization. Using this approach
   we obtained diverse panels of antibodies including: (i) antibodies with
   high affinity towards GP; (ii) antibodies which bound Ebola VLP
   Kissidougou-C15, the strain circulating in the recent West African
   outbreak; (iii) non-GP binding antibodies that recognize wild type Sudan
   or Bundibugyo viruses that have 39\% and 37\% sequence divergence from
   Ebola virus, respectively and (iv) antibodies to the Reston virus GP for
   which no antibodies have been reported.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a control problem of a non-holonomic
   multi-agent system. We assume that agents and obstacles are in a
   circular shaped work area. We propose a novel potential-function-based
   control scheme that drives agents from the initial to the goal
   configuration while avoiding collision with other agents, obstacles, and
   the boundary of the work area. The control scheme enables agents to
   avoid being trapped at local minima by forcing them to exit from the
   regions that may contain local minima. A numerical simulation is
   presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Isotetrasilane, neopentasilane, and cydohexasilane were studied as
   reactants for silicon (Si) nanorod growth in solution. These polysilane
   hydrides were found to enable lower growth temperatures in solution than
   any other silane reactants used to date. Cyclohexasilane enabled the
   lowest growth temperature of 200 degrees C, using a single-step solution
   liquid solid (SLS) reaction from tin (Sn) seeds. The potential for
   nanorod growth is determined by the reactivity of the silane.
   Cydohexasilane is the most reactive of the polysilane hydrides studied
   here, requiring the lowest energy for dehydrogenation. The formation of
   silylene by cycolhexasilane also facilitates chemisorption onto the Sn
   surface during nanorod growth. Relatively bright photoluminescence
   (emission quantum yields of 2\%) could still be achieved from Si
   nanorods grown at these low temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{A resonance Raman study of graphene samples with different C-13 isotopic
   concentrations and using different laser excitation energies is
   presented. The main Raman peaks (D, G, G{*}, and 2D) of graphene were
   measured and the dependence of their frequencies on the isotope atomic
   mass follows a simple harmonic oscillator relation. The G{*} and 2D
   double-resonance peak positions were measured as a function of the laser
   energy, and we observed that the slopes of the laser energy dependence
   are the same independently of isotope concentration. This result shows
   that isotopic substitution does not alter the electron and phonon
   dispersions near the K point of the graphene Brillouin zone. From the
   linewidth of G and 2D Raman peaks, we have also obtained a dependence of
   the phonon lifetime on the C-13 isotope concentration.}},

Abstract = {{CsPbF3 is the only experimentally synthesized ABF3 fluoride perovskite
   with a polar ground state. We use CsPbF3 as a guide in our search for
   rules to rationally design new ABX(3) polar fluorides and halides from
   first-principles and as a model compound to study the interactions of
   lone pairs, octahedral rotations, and A- and B-site driven
   ferroelectricity. We find that the lone pair cation on the B-site serves
   to stabilize a polar ground state, analogous to the role of lone pair
   cations on the A-site of oxide perovsldtes. However, we also find that
   the lone pair determines the pattern of nonpolar structural distortions,
   rotations of the PbF6 octahedra, that characterize the lowest energy
   structure. This result is remarkable since rotations are typically
   associated with bonding preferences of the A-site cation (here Cs+),
   whereas the Pb2+ cation occupies the B site. We show that the
   coordination requirements of the A-site cation and the stereoactivity of
   the B-site lone pair cation compete or cooperate via the anionic
   displacements that accompany polar distortions. We consider the
   generalizability of our findings for CsPbF3 and how they may be extended
   to the oxide perovskites as well as to the organic-inorganic hybrid
   halide perovskite photovoltaics.}},

Abstract = {{Atomically detailed simulations of HIV RT are performed to investigate
   the contributions of the conformational transition to the overall rate
   and specificity of enzyme catalysis. A number of different scenarios are
   considered within Milestoning theory to provide a more complete picture
   of the process of opening and closing the enzyme. We consider the open
   to closed transition in the absence of and with the correct and
   incorrect substrates. We also consider the free energy profile and the
   kinetics of the conformational change after the chemistry step in which
   a new base was added to the DNA, but the DNA was not yet displaced. We
   partition the free energy along the reaction coordinate and analyze the
   importance of different protein domains. Strikingly, significant
   influence on the free energy profile is detected for amino acids far
   from the active site. The overall long-range impact is about 50 percent
   of the total. We also illustrate that the overall rate is not
   necessarily determined by the highest free energy barrier along the
   reaction path (with respect to the free enzyme and substrate) and that
   the specificity is not necessarily determined by the same reaction step
   that determines the rate.}},

Abstract = {{The successful development of nanoscale machinery, which can operate
   with high controllability, high precision, long lifetimes, and tunable
   driving powers, is pivotal for the realization of future intelligent
   nanorobots, nanofactories, and advanced biomedical devices. However, the
   development of nanomachines remains one of the most difficult research
   areas, largely due to the grand challenges in fabrication of devices
   with complex components and actuation with desired efficiency,
   precision, lifetime, and/or environmental friendliness. In this work,
   the cutting-edge efforts toward fabricating and actuating various types
   of nanomachines and their applications are reviewed, with a special
   focus on nanomotors made from inorganic nanoscale building blocks, which
   are introduced according to the employed actuation mechanism. The unique
   characteristics and obstacles for each type of nanomachine are
   discussed, and perspectives and challenges of this exciting field are

Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the fabrication of crosslinked nonwoven fibers via
   simultaneous thiol-ene photopolymerization and spinning of monomer jets
   has been demonstrated in centrifugal Forcespinning for the first time.
   We observed that simultaneous Forcespinning and photopolymerization
   resulted in a wide variety of fiber morphologies including beads,
   beads-on-string, uniform fiber, fused fibers, and well-cured fibers. To
   elucidate the underlying mechanisms and parameter interactions that give
   rise to these morphologies, we systematically varied the light
   intensity, solution elasticity, and spin speed of the Forcespinning
   process. From these experimental results, an operating diagram was
   constructed based on the measured process parameters, their respective
   timescales, and observed effects on fiber morphology. While numerous
   parameters can individually affect fiber formation and morphology, the
   interplay between curing kinetics, solution viscoelasticity, and
   orifice-to-collector processing time window is also crucial in this
   process. Smooth and well-cured fibers were formed only when the
   photopolymerization occurred sufficiently quickly, before both the
   breakup of fibers into droplets due to a surface tension driven Rayleigh
   instability and the deposition of fibers on the collector. Our findings
   can serve as a predictive guideline for the fabrication of crosslinked
   fibers with desired morphology, the implementation of the in-situ
   polymerization and spinning concept into other commercial fiber
   manufacturing technologies, and the adaptation of other functional or
   high performance monomer systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Number = {{9, SI}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Two methods for deriving first-order partial derivatives of the outputs
   with respect to the inputs of the Lambert boundary value problem are
   presented. The first method assumes the Lambert problem is solved via
   the universal vercosine formulation. Taking advantage of inherent
   symmetries and intermediate variables, the derivatives are expressed in
   a computationally efficient form. The typical added cost of computing
   these partials is found to be approximate to 15 to 35\% of the Lambert
   computed cost. A second set of the same partial derivatives is derived
   from the fundamental perturbation matrix, also known as the state
   transition matrix of the Keplerian initial value problem. The equations
   are formulated in terms of Battin's partitions of the state transition
   matrix and its adjoint. This alternative approach works with any Lambert
   formulation, including one that solves a perturbed Lambert problem,
   subject to the availability of the associated state transition matrix.
   The analytic partial derivatives enable fast trajectory optimization
   formulations that implicitly enforce continuity constraints via embedded
   Lambert problems.}},

   was instrumented with 224 vibrating-wire gauges that were embedded in
   the arches prior to concrete placement. The gauges were monitored during
   posttensioning, handling, and transport as well as deck construction.
   The instrumentation provided data on the stresses induced in the arches,
   which were used to ensure a safe environment throughout construction.
   The measurements also provided a means for evaluating the accuracy of
   stress calculations that were made during design. The results obtained
   from this study provide a unique insight into the behavior of concrete

Abstract = {{It is common practice when drilling oil and gas wells to assume that the
   drillstring is placed concentrically in the annular space with either
   the open hole or previous casing strings in order to predict annular
   frictional pressure losses. The assumption of such a concentric annulus
   is, however, a considerable simplification that may not properly reflect
   the majority of drilling applications in the field. In fact, with an
   increasing number of deviated/horizontal and extended reach wells being
   drilled, a fully eccentric annulus is actually present in a large
   section of the wellbore.
   In this study, we apply experimental, analytical, and numerical
   approaches to investigate the impact of drillpipe eccentricity on the
   annular pressure loss while circulating non-Newtonian drilling fluids.
   The length of the experimental section of a flow loop was 27.74 m (91')
   and it consisted of 0.0245 m(1 `') steel drillpipe and 0.0571 m (2.25
   `') acrylic casing with the inner diameter of 0.0508 m (2 `'). Drillpipe
   was placed at the bottom of the casing, thereby simulating a fully
   eccentric annulus. Four Yield Power Law (YPL) drilling fluids were
   tested in this flow loop. Annular pressure loss for a wide range of
   laminar flow rates was recorded for each fluid. A numerical model based
   on a finite difference approach was developed to estimate the annular
   pressure loss. Subsequently, the experimental data was compared with the
   proposed model and also with several other widely used analytical and
   numerical approaches previously reported in the literature. The obtained
   results show that in the laminar flow regime, the annular frictional
   pressure loss in a fully eccentric annulus is considerably less than a
   concentric annulus, on occasions by less than 50\%. In general, all the
   applied models under-estimated the effect of eccentricity on pressure
   loss. However, the novel proposed model showed the least discrepancy
   with the experimental data. Furthermore, it was found that the
   difference between the estimated and experimental results increases with
   increasing fluid yield stress. This suggests that models and/or
   correlations that are developed to correct for the eccentricity effect
   for fluids with negligible yield stress (for instance Power Law fluids)
   are not suitable to estimate the pressure loss for YPL fluids with
   elevated yield stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Light trapping is an important technique in increasing the efficiency of
   solar cells. Inverse optimization is a systematic numerical approach
   that allows us to find the limits of light trapping more efficiently. It
   is an alternative to exhaustive search simulations or experimental
   measurements. In this study, we use inverse optimization to study light
   trapping in thin film amorphous silicon cells textured by periodic
   patterns of metallic surface grating. We use a finite set of Haar
   wavelets to describe a general form of grating structure composed of
   multiple rectangular nanostrips. We use a well-known global
   multiparameter optimization technique called simulated annealing to find
   the coefficients of the wavelets basis for optimal absorptivity
   enhancement in thin film silicon. The motivation for choosing wavelet
   basis (vis-a-vis other orthonormal bases such as Fourier) is the
   feasibility of fabricating the resulting nanostructures. The resulting
   improvement in the number of absorbed photons is around 130\% for
   wavelength range of 300-700 nm, which is significantly better than the
   previous results using simple front surface nanostrips. In addition, we
   use statistical tools to evaluate the sensitivity of the characteristics
   of the resulting structure to numerical uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer flooding, as an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method, has been
   widely used in petroleum engineering. However, as polymer flooding in
   oil reservoirs enters mid-and-late stages, `injectivity profile reverse
   phenomenon' appears in some blocks with strong anisotropy where more
   fluids transport through the formation with higher permeability than
   that in water flooding reservoirs, while the formation with lower
   permeability absorb fewer fluids. This phenomenon dramatically affects
   the performance of polymer flooding, resulting in unsatisfied EOR. In
   this work, the regularity of injectivity profile reverse phenomenon is
   analyzed, and the effects of injection velocity and molecular weight of
   polymer are investigated, The results show that bigger molecular weight
   of polymer and higher injection velocity result in earlier appearance of
   injectivity profile reverse phenomenon and decreased cumulative
   imbibition rate of low-permeability layer, which leads to lower sweep
   efficiency of polymer flooding under experimental conditions. This work
   explores the feasible application of proper methods to relieve the
   injectivity profile reverse phenomenon and to improve oil recovery, such
   as multi-layer polymer injection, injection velocity control,
   polymer-water alternative flooding, and deep profile control ahead of
   polymer injection.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of gas/particle partition coefficients for semivolatile
   organic compounds (SVOCs) using filter-sorbent samplers can be biased if
   a fraction of gas-phase mass is measured erroneously as particle-phase
   due to sorption of SVOC gases to the filter, or, if a fraction of
   particle-phase mass is measured erroneously as gas-phase due to
   penetration of particles into the sorbent. A fundamental mechanistic
   model to characterize the air sampling process with filter-sorbent
   samplers for SVOCs was developed and partially validated. The potential
   sampling artifacts associated with measurements of gas-particle
   partitioning were examined for 19 SVOCs. Positive sampling bias (i.e.,
   overestimation of gas/particle partition coefficients) was observed for
   almost all the SVOCs. For certain compounds, the measured partition
   coefficient was several orders of magnitude greater than the presumed
   value. It was found that the sampling artifacts can be ignored when the
   value of log{[}K-f/(K-p . C-p,C-a)] is less than 7. By normalizing the
   model, general factors that influence the sampling artifacts were
   investigated. Correlations were obtained between the dimensionless time
   required for the gas-phase SVOCs within the filter to reach steady state
   (T-s,T-s{*}) and the chemical V-p values, which can be used to estimate
   appropriate sampling time. The potential errors between measured and
   actual gas/particle partition coefficients of SVOCs as a function of
   sampling velocity and time were calculated and plotted for a range of
   SVOCs (vapor pressures: 10(-8) similar to 10(-3) Pa). These plots were
   useful in identifying bias from the sampling in previously-completed
   field measurements. Penetration of particles into the sorbent may result
   in significant underestimation of the partition coefficient for
   particles in the size range between 10 nm and 2 mu m. For most of the
   selected compounds, backup filters can be used to correct artifacts
   effectively. However, for some compounds with very low vapor pressure,
   the artifacts remained or became even larger than they were without the
   backup filter. Thus, the option of backup filters must be considered
   carefully in field measurements of the gas/particle partitioning of
   SVOCs. The results of this work will allow researchers to predict
   potential artifacts associated with SVOC gas/particle partitioning as
   functions of compounds, the concentration of particles, the distribution
   of particle sizes, sampling velocity, and sampling time. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The growing interest in performing high-resolution, deep-tissue imaging
   has galvanized the use of longer excitation wavelengths and
   three-photon-based techniques in nonlinear imaging modalities. This
   study presents a threefold improvement in maximum imaging depth of ex
   vivo porcine vocal folds using third-harmonic generation (THG)
   microscopy at 1552-nm excitation wavelength compared to two-photon
   microscopy (TPM) at 776-nm excitation wavelength. The experimental,
   analytical, and Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that THG improves
   the maximum imaging depth observed in TPM significantly from 140 to 420
   mu m in a highly scattered medium, reaching the expected theoretical
   imaging depth of seven extinction lengths. This value almost doubles the
   previously reported normalized imaging depths of 3.5 to 4.5 extinction
   lengths using three-photon-based imaging modalities. Since tissue
   absorption is substantial at the excitation wavelength of 1552 nm, this
   study assesses the tissue thermal damage during imaging by obtaining the
   depth-resolved temperature distribution through a numerical simulation
   incorporating an experimentally obtained thermal relaxation time (tau).
   By shuttering the laser for a period of 2 tau, the numerical algorithm
   estimates a maximum temperature increase of similar to 2 degrees C at
   the maximum imaging depth of 420 mu m. The paper demonstrates that THG
   imaging using 1552 nm as an illumination wavelength with effective
   thermal management proves to be a powerful deep imaging modality for
   highly scattering and absorbing tissues, such as scarred vocal folds.

Abstract = {{CO2 foams that are stabilized with nanoparticles are being considered to
   improve volumetric sweep efficiency for CO2 enhanced oil recovery
   ({[}OR) processes. To better understand the nanoparticle
   retention/transport under high salinity conditions often associated with
   typical hydrocarbon reservoirs, the aggregation of the surface-treated
   silica nanoparticles was studied as a function of salinity and
   nanoparticle concentration. At pH 8.5, an enhancement in aggregation
   kinetics occurred with increasing calcium and particle concentration.
   However, when the pH was reduced to ca. 3, close to the CO2 saturated
   condition, the aggregation was insignificant regardless of the salinity
   and the particle concentration over 10 days.
   In the transport test of silica nanoparticles in the sandpack column, a
   negligible amount of nanoparticles was retained with non-aggregated
   nanoparticles and for aggregates less than 235 nm regardless of flow
   rate. However, the retention of larger aggregates ( > ca. 1000 nm) was
   enhanced as Darcy velocity decreased. Modeling based on a modified
   version of clean-bed filtration theory was able to explain experimental
   breakthrough curves only for the non-aggregated and slightly aggregated
   particles, suggesting that further considerations are essential to
   understand the physical effect of aggregation on the transport of larger
   aggregates. These results suggest a possible breakdown of the aggregates
   due to the hydrodynamic forces, hence retrieving the mobility of silica
   nanoparticles in the porous media.
   These observations demonstrate that silica nanoparticle aggregation can
   be prevented by increasing Flow rate and lowering pH. The findings of
   this study would provide an insight on the behavior of nanoparticle in
   the reservoirs and a guideline for the application of the nanoparticles
   in enhanced oil recovery operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{CO2 foam flooding for improved oil recovery: Reservoir simulation models

Abstract = {{A mechanistic model of CO2 foam that allows for direct simulation of
   foam generation, propagation, coalescence and collapse was described in
   this study. The controlling parameters, such as reaction rate factors
   for foam generation, coalescence and collapse in presence of oil, the
   viscosity of foaming components and surfactant adsorption, were adjusted
   to match the experimental results of CO2 foam coreflooding. A three
   dimensional heterogeneous conceptual reservoir model was then built to
   study the mechanisms of CO2 foam flooding based the foam model. The
   simulation results show that CO2 foam flooding can improve oil recovery
   through a combination of various mechanisms, including selective
   blocking and conformance control, gas up flow effect, reservoir energy
   support, and the improvement of displacement efficiency. The sensitivity
   and the effect of different influencing factors on the performance of
   CO2 foam flooding were investigated via the simulation models on various
   scenarios. CO2 foam flooding can achieve a better oil recovery in
   comparison with water flooding, CO2 flooding and WAG (water alternating
   gas) processes. Early CO2 foam injection is conducive to the improvement
   of oil recovery and the success of the project. CO2 foam flooding
   technique can be applied in a wide range of complex reservoirs,
   especially for highly heterogeneous reservoirs with high permeability
   channels, and reservoirs with different sedimentary sequences. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Tissues in the body are hierarchically structured composite materials

   In this communication, we explain the solvent interactions governing the
   solubility of urea and thereby the scope of compatible polymers. We also
   highlight the role of solvent interactions on the morphology of the
   resulting supracolloidal crystals. We elucidate the role of polymer-urea
   interactions on the morphology of the pores in the resulting
   biomaterials. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to use our
   urea templating methodology to prepare Bombyx mori silk protein-based
   biomaterials with pores that human dermal fibroblasts respond to by
   aligning with the long axis of the pores. This methodology has potential
   for application in a variety of different tissue engineering niches in

   a dynamic Wardrop equilibrium provably exists. This formulation is
   general, but is particularly designed to include the link and node

   than using path flows to describe route choice, travelers are aggregated
   by destination and node-specific routing parameters are used to reduce
   the number of control variables needed. Furthermore, this formulation
   allows efficient solution methods from static traffic assignment, such
   as Linear User Cost Equilibrium (LUCE), to be applied in a fairly
   straightforward manner. Demonstrations on a small network verify the
   effectiveness of this dynamic LUCE algorithm in our model, showing
   favorable performance comapred to the method of successive averages.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Catheter-tissue contact is essential for effective lesion
   formation, thus there is growing usage of contact force (CF) technology
   in atrial fibrillation ablation. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess
   the impact of CF on clinical outcomes and procedural parameters in
   comparison to conventional catheter for atrial fibrillation ablation.
   Methods and Results-An electronic search was performed using major
   databases. Outcomes of interest were recurrence rate, major
   complications, total procedure, and fluoroscopic times. Continuous
   variables were reported as standardized mean difference; odds ratios
   were reported for dichotomous variables. Eleven studies (2 randomized
   controlled studies and 9 cohorts) involving 1428 adult patients were
   identified. CF was deployed in 552 patients. The range of CF used was
   between 2 to 60 gramforce. The follow-up period ranged between 10 and 53
   weeks. In comparing CF and conventional catheter groups, the recurrence
   rate was lower with CF (35.1\% versus 45.5\%, odds ratio 0.62 {[}95\% CI
   0.45-0.86], P=0.004). Shorter procedure and fluoroscopic times were
   achieved with CF (procedure time: 156 versus 173 minutes, standardized
   mean difference -0.85 {[}95\% CI -1.48 to +/- 0.21], P=0.009;
   fluoroscopic time: 28 versus 36 minutes, standardized mean difference
   -0.94 {[}95\% CI -1.66; -0.21], P=0.01). Major complication rate was
   lower numerically in the CF group but not statistically significant
   (1.3\% versus 1.9\%, odds ratio 0.71 {[}95\% CI 0.29-1.73], P=0.45).
   Conclusions-The use of CF technology results in significant reduction of
   the atrial fibrillation recurrence rate after atrial fibrillation
   ablation in comparison to the conventional catheter group. CF technology
   is able to significantly reduce procedure and fluoroscopic times without
   compromising complication rate.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted in which 30 full-scale, precast,

   different concrete materials and construction techniques. The
   constructed girders were conditioned in several different climates for
   up to 3 years. During this period, prestress loss was measured by using
   vibrating wire gauges (VWG) embedded in test specimens. Following the
   conditioning period, the girders were flexural service load-tested to
   quantify the prestress loss at the time of testing and in turn verify
   the losses measured using VWGs. Prestress losses were found to be
   heavily influenced by concrete stiffness, which was dependent on coarse
   aggregate type and quantity. The measured short- and long-term prestress
   losses were compared to those determined using several different

Abstract = {{The sweep efficiency of CO2 enhanced oil recovery can be improved by
   forming viscous CO2-in-water (C/W) foams that increase the viscosity of
   CO2. The goal of this study is to identify CO2-soluble ionic surfactants
   that stabilize C/W foams at elevated temperatures up to 120 degrees C in
   the presence of a high salinity brine using aqueous phase stability,
   static and dynamic adsorption, CO2 solubility, interfacial tension, foam
   bubble size, and foam viscosity measurements. An anionic sulfonate
   surfactant and an amphoteric acetate surfactant were selected to achieve
   good thermal and chemical stability, and to minimize adsorption to
   sandstone reservoirs in the harsh high-salinity high-temperature brine.
   The strong solvation of the surfactant head by the brine phase and
   surfactant tail by CO2 allows efficient reduction of the C/W interfacial
   tension, and the formation of viscous C/W foams at high salinity and
   high temperature. Furthermore, the effect of temperature and methane
   dilution of CO2 on foam viscosity was evaluated systematically in both
   bulk and porous media. High temperature reduces the stability of foam
   lamella, which leads to lower lamella density and, therefore, lower foam
   viscosity. Methane dilution of CO2 reduces the solvation of surfactant
   tails and makes the surfactant less CO2-philic at the interface. The
   consequent increase of the interfacial tension decreases the stability
   of foam lamella, as seen by the increase in foam bubble size, thereby
   reducing foam viscosity.}},

Abstract = {{It is essential to know the mechanical properties of structural steel at
   elevated temperatures, for analysis of structural response to fire or
   other high temperature extremes. One of the key elements for such
   analyses is the availability of a constitutive model for material
   stress-strain response. This paper provides recommended engineering
   stress-strain equations for ASTM A992 steel for temperatures up to 1000A
   degrees C, based on an extensive series of tests. These recommended
   stress-strain equations are compared with experimental data and with
   stress-strain equations recommended by Eurocode 3 (EC3) and by the US
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).}},

Title = {{Enhanced light absorption by mixed source black and brown carbon
   particles in UK winter}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) and light-absorbing organic carbon (brown carbon, BrC)
   play key roles in warming the atmosphere, but the magnitude of their
   effects remains highly uncertain. Theoretical modelling and laboratory
   experiments demonstrate that coatings on BC can enhance BC's light
   absorption, therefore many climate models simply assume enhanced BC
   absorption by a factor of similar to 1.5. However, recent field
   observations show negligible absorption enhancement, implying models may
   overestimate BC's warming. Here we report direct evidence of substantial
   field-measured BC absorption enhancement, with the magnitude strongly
   depending on BC coating amount. Increases in BC coating result from a
   combination of changing sources and photochemical aging processes. When
   the influence of BrC is accounted for, observationally constrained model
   calculations of the BC absorption enhancement can be reconciled with the
   observations. We conclude that the influence of coatings on BC
   absorption should be treated as a source and regionally specific
   parameter in climate models.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of groundwater contamination in an aquifer is one with many
   uncertainties. Properly quantifying these uncertainties is essential in
   order to make reliable probabilistic-based predictions and decisions
   regarding remediation strategies. In this work, a measure-theoretic
   framework is employed to quantify uncertainties in a simplified
   groundwater contamination transport model. Given uncertain data from
   observation wells, the stochastic inverse problem is solved numerically
   to obtain a probability measure on the space of unknown model parameters
   characterizing groundwater flow and contaminant transport in an aquifer,
   as well as unknown model boundary or source terms such as the
   contaminant source release into the environment. This probability
   measure is used to make predictions of future contaminant concentrations
   and to analyze possible remediation techniques. The ability to identify
   regions of small but nonzero probability using this method is
   illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{BiVO4 is one of the most promising candidates for photoanodes in solar
   water splitting. However, the poor charge-separation yield in BiVO4 has
   limited its photochemical activity. Here, we overcome this limitation by
   constructing a nanoporous morphology that effectively inhibits bulk
   carrier recombination as well as undergoes controlled introduction of
   oxygen vacancies through hydrogenation. In comparison to pristine BiVO4,
   hydrogen-treated BiVO4 (H-BiVO4-x) exhibits a superior photocurrent and
   electron-hole separation yield, owing to enhanced carrier density and
   conductivity. In addition, we adopt a layer of nickel-borate (Ni-B-i)
   complex on the H-BiVO4-x surface as an oxygen evolution catalyst to
   improve the water oxidation kinetics. The Ni-Bi/H-BiVO4-x photoanode
   results in a large cathodic shift (350 mV) in the onset potential for
   water oxidation at pH 9. Moreover, the photoanodes exhibit high
   performance in the low-bias regime and achieve a maximum power point of
   0.82\% (photon-to-current efficiency) for solar water oxidation at
   potentials as low as 0.79 V versus RHE with a photocurrent of 2.26
   mAcm(-2). We attribute these improved photoelectrochemical performances
   to the enhanced charge separation, higher carrier density, better
   conductivity of H-BiVO4-x, and the role of Ni-Bi as a hole conductor,
   facilitating photogenerated electron mobilization.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report an electrochemical method to simultaneously reduce and
   delaminate graphene oxide (G-0) thin films deposited on metal (Al and
   Au) substrates. During the electrochemical reaction, interface charge
   transfer between the G-0 thin film and the electrode surface was found
   to be important in eliminating oxygen-containing groups, yielding highly
   reduced graphene oxide (rG-0). In the meantime, hydrogen bubbles were
   electrochemically generated at the rG-0 film/electrode interface,
   propagating the film delamination. Unlike other metal-based G-0
   reduction methods, the metal used here was either not etched at all (for
   Au) or etched a small amount (for Al), thus making it possible to reuse
   the substrate and lower production costs. The delaminated rG-0 film
   exhibits a thickness-dependent degree of reduction: greater reduction is
   achieved in thinner films. The thin rG-0 films having an optical
   transmittance of 90\% (lambda=550 nm) had a sheet resistance of 6390 +/-
   447 Omega/square (ohms per square). rG-0-based stretchable transparent
   conducting films were also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide
   (TMD) that differs from other two-dimensional (2D) compounds such as
   graphene due to its unique semiconducting, tunable-band-gap nature.
   Multilayered WS2 exhibits an indirect band gap E-g of similar to 13 eV,
   along with a higher load-bearing ability that is promising for
   strain-tuning device applications, but the electronic properties of
   multilayered WS2 at higher strain conditions (i.e., static strain >12\%)
   remain an open question. Here we have studied the structural,
   electronic, electrical, and vibrational properties of multilayered WS2
   at hydrostatic pressures up to similar to 35 GPa experimentally in a
   diamond anvil cell and theoretically using first-principles ab initio
   calculations. Our results show that WS2 undergoes an isostructural
   semiconductor-to-metallic (S-M) transition at approximately 22 GPa at
   280 K, which arises from the overlap of the highest valence and lowest
   conduction bands. The S-M transition is caused by increased sulfur
   sulfur interactions as the interlayer spacing decreases with applied
   hydrostatic pressure. The metalization in WS2 can be alternatively
   interpreted as a 2D to 3D (three-dimensional) phase transition that is
   associated with a substantial modulation of the charge carrier
   characteristics including a 6-order decrease in resistivity, a 2-order
   decrease in mobility, and a 4-order increase in carrier concentration.
   These distinct pressure-tunable characteristics of the dimensionalized
   WS2 differentiate it from other TMD compounds such as MoS2 and promise
   future developments in strain-modulated advanced devices.}},

Abstract = {{Borehole sonic measurements are routinely used to measure dynamic
   elastic properties of rock formations surrounding a wellbore. However,
   shoulder-bed effects, mud-filtrate invasion, and near-wellbore damage
   often influence the measurements and bias the interpretations.
   Inversion-based methods can reduce the influence of complex geometric
   conditions in the estimation of formation properties from sonic logs,
   but they require fast-forward modeling algorithms. We have developed new
   spatial sensitivity functions for rapid modeling of borehole sonic
   measurements, which were equivalent to the Green's functions of borehole
   modal wave measurements. An adaptive finite-element (FE) method was used
   to calculate 1D axial (vertical) and 2D (axial-radial) sensitivity
   functions, which combined the dependence of sonic logs on the wave mode,
   frequency, formation properties, and logging-instrument geometry.
   Semianalytical formulations were also used to calculate the sensitivity
   functions, which involved modeling the wave propagation through an
   effective layered medium. The 1D axial sensitivity functions were also
   extended to quantify propagation properties of nondispersive modes in a
   borehole. Calculated semianalytical sensitivity coefficients were
   efficient for rapid simulation of modal frequency dispersion in the
   presence of a logging tool. Simulated sonic logging measurements across
   synthetic thinly bedded and invaded formations were compared with
   numerical simulations obtained with the finite-element method. Our
   results confirmed the efficiency, reliability, and accuracy of the
   approximate sonic simulation method. The maximum relative error of the
   rapid simulation method was consistently less than 4\%, with only 2\% of
   the central processing unit time and 2\% of the memory usage compared
   with FE simulations.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{When laminating a thin elastic membrane on a substrate with surface
   roughness, three scenarios can happen: 1) fully conformed, i.e., the
   membrane completely follows the surface morphology of the substrate
   without any interfacial gap; 2) partially conformed; and 3)
   nonconformed, i.e., the membrane remains flat if gravity is not
   concerned. Good conformability can enhance effective
   membrane-to-substrate adhesion and can facilitate heat/signal transfer
   across the interface, which are of great importance for micromembranes
   or nanomembranes transferred on target substrates and for flexible
   electronics laminated on rough biotissues. To reveal the governing
   parameters in this problem and to predict the conformability, energy
   minimization method is implemented with two different interfacial
   models, adhesion energy versus traction-separation relation. Depending
   on the complexity of the models, one to four dimensionless governing
   parameters have been identified to analytically predict the
   conformability status and the point of delamination if partial
   conformability is expected. In any case, partial conformability is
   achieved only when membrane energy is considered.}},

Abstract = {{Many biomedical applications necessitate a targeted intracellular
   delivery of the nanomaterial to specific cells. Therefore, a
   non-invasive and reliable imaging tool is required to detect both the
   delivery and cellular endocytosis of the nanoparticles. Herein, we
   demonstrate that magneto-photo-acoustic (MPA) imaging can be used to
   monitor the delivery and to identify endocytosis of magnetic and
   optically absorbing nanoparticles. The relationship between
   photoacoustic (PA) and magneto-motive ultrasound (MMUS) signals from the
   in vitro samples were analyzed to identify the delivery and endocytosis
   of nanoparticles. The results indicated that during the delivery of
   nanoparticles to the vicinity of the cells, both PA and MMUS signals are
   almost linearly proportional. However, accumulation of nanoparticles
   within the cells leads to nonlinear MMUS-PA relationship, due to
   non-linear MMUS signal amplification. Therefore, through longitudinal
   MPA imaging, it is possible to monitor the delivery of nanoparticles and
   identify the endocytosis of the nanoparticles by living cells. (C) 2015

Title = {{Methane dual-site adsorption in organic-rich shale-gas and coalbed
   systems}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Herein, we report on a novel dual-site adsorption model to determine
   state of methane in shale formations and coalbeds. By considering two
   surface energy terms, the model distinguishes methane adsorption in the
   intrinsic micropore volume of the organic matter from that of the
   inorganic structure. One energy term describes methane adsorption in
   micropores (<2 nm) whereas the other one concerns with meso-macropores.
   This study showed that at storage conditions, 150 bar and 50.4 degrees
   C, where methane is in supercritical state, the surface energy plays the
   major role to influence methane adsorption capacity whereas the effect
   of lateral forces between adsorbed molecules has a minor influence on
   overall adsorption capacity. We applied the model on experimental
   methane adsorption data in three organic-rich samples including Woodford
   shale, Woodford isolated kerogen and Cameo coal to quantify their
   methane storage state. Textural properties of shale and coal samples
   were analyzed by N-2 porosimetry at -196 degrees C. The samples had a
   weak micropore peak followed by a broader peak stretched over meso and
   macropore regions up to nearly 120 nm. Fitting the dual-site model to
   experimental methane adsorption data revealed that, among all, the coal
   sample, with the average heat of adsorption of 24.5 kJ/mol, had the
   highest interaction energies with both micro- and mesopore sites.
   Further, we find that 37\%, 81\% and 83\% of methane was stored in the
   organic matter of Woodford shale, Woodford isolated kerogen and Cameo
   coal, respectively. Considering low maturity, and hence low micropore
   volume of the samples, and based on significant methane storage in the

Abstract = {{Lipogenic organisms represent great starting points for metabolic
   engineering of oleochemical production. While previous engineering
   efforts were able to significantly improve lipid production in Yarrovvia
   lipolytica, the lipogenesis landscape, especially with respect to
   regulatory elements, has not been fully explored. Through a comparative
   genomics and transcriptomics approach, we identified and validated a
   mutant mga2 protein that serves as a regulator of desaturase gene
   expression and potent lipogenesis factor. The resulting strain is
   enriched in unsaturated fatty acids. Comparing the underlying mechanism
   of this mutant to other previously engineered strains suggests that
   creating an imbalance between glycolysis and the TCA cycle can serve as
   a driving force for lipogenesis when combined with fatty acid catabolism
   overexpressions. Further comparative transcriptomics analysis revealed
   both distinct and convergent rewiring associated with these different
   genotypes. Finally, by combining metabolic engineering targets, it is
   possible to further engineer a strain containing the mutant mga2 gene to
   a lipid production titer of 25 g/L. (C) 2015 International Metabolic

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{879-914}},

Abstract = {{This paper formulates a model that extends the traditional panel
   discrete choice model to include social/spatial dependencies in the form
   of dyadic interactions between each pair of decision-makers. In
   addition, the formulation accommodates spatial correlation effects as
   well as allows a global spatial structure to be placed on the
   individual-specific unobserved response sensitivity to exogenous
   variables. We interpret these latter two effects, sometimes referred to
   as spatial drift effects, as originating from endogenous group
   formation. To our knowledge, we are the first to suggest this endogenous
   group formation interpretation for spatial drift effects in the
   social/spatial interactions literature. The formulation is motivated in
   a travel mode choice context, but is applicable in a wide variety of
   other empirical contexts. Bhat's (Transp Res B 45(7):923-939, 2011)
   maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) procedure is
   used for model estimation. A simulation exercise indicates that the
   MACML approach recovers the model parameters very well, even in the
   presence of high spatial dependence and endogenous group formation
   tendency. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that ignoring
   spatial dependence and endogenous group formation when both are actually
   present will lead to bias in parameter estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Development and function of the immune system depends on cells
   exchanging information between themselves and with their environment.
   This information is processed and integrated by complex signal
   transduction and gene regulatory networks with rich temporal dynamics. A
   growing body of evidence points to a combination of network topology and
   temporal dynamics as a fundamental link between stimulus and function.
   Recent findings also bring cellular variability and stochastic events to
   the forefront as additional determinants of cell population responses to
   immune cues. In this article, we review examples of how the trinity of
   network topology, temporal dynamics, and cellular variability together
   determine the immune function. In particular we focus on Nuclear Factor
   kappa-B and T-cell receptor signaling networks as they have proven
   fertile ground for studying how function arises from the combination of
   topology, dynamics, and variability in a context of great clinical
   importance. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The bicontinuous microemulsion (B mu E) phase is an equilibrium
   morphology characterized by cocontinuous domains, high interfacial
   areas, and nanoscale domain dimensions. These characteristics make the B

   Here, we use a combination of simulations and experiments to investigate
   the equilibrium morphologies formed by a ternary blend of conjugated
   polymer, all-conjugated diblock copolymer, and fullerene derivative
   PCBM. Using coarse-grained simulations, we identify the blend
   compositions that are most likely to result in donor/acceptor
   morphologies resembling the B mu E. Experimentally, we probe these
   compositions through transmission electron microscopy and
   grazing-incidence X-ray scattering measurements. We demonstrate that
   all-conjugated block copolymer additives can be used to produce
   thermally stable, cocontinuous donor/acceptor morphologies at higher
   additive contents and longer annealing times than previously reported.
   These results demonstrate that conjugated BCP compatibilizers can be
   used as a means to achieve equilibrium, cocontinuous morphologies in
   donor/acceptor blends.}},

Title = {{A Transparent Pullout Testing Device for 3D Evaluation of Soil-Geogrid
   Interaction}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{686-707}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presented a newly developed transparent pullout testing
   device conceived with the objective of studying the soil-geogrid
   interaction under small displacements and strains. The bottom plate and
   the side walls of the pullout box were transparent. The system involved
   a transparent soil, which was tested as a surrogate for sands in the
   testing program. The setup led to 3D visualization of the soil-geogrid
   interaction as it allowed direct visualization of the plan view of the
   geogrid as well as of the side view of the soil-geogrid interface.
   Markers embedded in the transparent soil mass allowed tracking of soil
   particle displacements during the test. The tests were conducted using a
   polypropylene biaxial geogrid and both transparent soil and a
   conventional sand. Displacements along the geogrid were obtained
   continuously using digital image correlation (DIC) techniques in tests
   with transparent soil, and using tell-tails at five junctions in tests
   with sand. Comparison of test results with both soils showed that the
   transparent soil constitutes a good surrogate for sands in pullout
   studies. The pullout test with transparent soil also indicated that
   displacements along the geogrid could be properly described using an
   exponential function. Moreover, exponential fitting to the displacement
   data led to an exponential distribution of strains along the geogrid
   during pullout testing. Deflections of transverse ribs were first
   observed at early stages of the test when only 25 \% of the maximum
   pullout force developed. The observed displacement patterns of the soil
   markers were useful in defining the zone of influence of the geogrid,
   which could be successfully quantified using the newly developed testing
   device. Overall, the new equipment was found to represent an effective
   tool to better understand the mechanisms involved in soil-geogrid
   interaction, particularly those that are relevant to quantify the
   interface stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a novel analytical framework for asynchronous
   wireless networks deploying multicarrier transmission over flat-fading
   channels. Nodes in the network have different notions of timing;
   therefore, from the viewpoint of a typical receiver, the received
   signals from different transmitters are asynchronous, leading to a loss
   of orthogonality between subcarriers. We first develop a detailed
   link-level analysis based on OFDM, based on which we propose a tractable
   system-level signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model for
   asynchronous OFDM networks. The proposed model is used to analytically
   characterize several important statistics in asynchronous networks with
   spatially distributed transmitters, including: (i) the number of
   decodable transmitters; (ii) the decoding probability of the nearest
   transmitter; and (iii) the system throughput. The system-level loss from
   lack of synchronization is quantified, and to mitigate the loss, we
   compare and discuss four possible solutions including extended cyclic
   prefix, advanced receiver timing, dynamic receiver timing positioning,
   and semi-static receiver timing positioning with multiple timing
   hypotheses. The model and results are general, and apply to ad hoc
   networks, cellular systems, and neighbor discovery in device-to-device
   (D2D) networks.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding evacuation practices and outcomes helps crisis and
   disaster personnel plan, manage, and rebuild during disasters. Yet the
   recent expansion in the number of information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) available to individuals and organizations has
   changed the speed and reach of evacuation-related messages. This study
   explores ICTs' influences on evacuation decision-making and traffic
   congestion. Drawing from both social science and transportation science,
   we develop a model representative of individual decision making outcomes
   based on the amount of ICT use, evacuation sources, and the degree of
   evacuation urgency. We compare the evacuation responses when individuals
   receive both advance notice of evacuation (ANE) and urgent evacuation
   (UE) messages under conditions of no ICTs and prolific ICT use. Our
   findings from the scenarios when there is widespread ICT use reveal a
   shift in the evacuation time-scale, resulting in traffic congestion
   early in the evacuation cycle. The effects of this congestion in urgent
   situations are significantly worse than traffic congestion in the
   advance notice condition. Even under conditions where face-to-face
   communication is the only option, evacuations still occur, but at a
   slower rate, and there are virtually no traffic congestion issues. Our
   discussion elaborates on the theoretical contributions and focuses on
   how ICTs have changed evacuation behavior. Future research is needed to
   explore how to compensate for the rush to the road.}},

Abstract = {{Self-healing materials emerge as a fascinating class of materials
   important for various technological applications. However, achieving the
   synergistic characteristics of high conductivity, room-temperature
   self-healing ability, and decent mechanical properties still remains a
   critical challenge. Here we develop for the first time a hybrid gel
   based on self-assembled supramolecular gel and nano structured
   polypyrrole that synergizes the dynamic assembly/disassembly nature of
   metal-ligand supramolecule and the conductive nanostructure of
   polypyrrole hydrogel and exhibits features of high conductivity (12 S
   m(-1)), appealing mechanical and electrical self-healing property
   without any external stimuli, and enhanced mechanical strength and
   flexibility. The attractive characteristics of the hybrid gel are
   further demonstrated by a flexible yet self-healable electrical circuit.
   Our work shows the great potential of self-healing hybrid gel system in
   flexible electronics and provides a useful strategy to design
   multifunctional self-healing materials.}},

Title = {{A new generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) to jointly model mixed
   types of dependent variables}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{50-77}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper formulates a generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) that
   jointly handles mixed types of dependent variables including multiple
   nominal outcomes, multiple ordinal variables, and multiple count
   variables, as well as multiple continuous variables by representing the
   covariance relationships among them through a reduced number of latent
   factors. Sufficiency conditions for identification of the GHDM
   parameters are presented. The maximum approximate composite marginal
   likelihood (MACML) method is proposed to estimate this jointly mixed
   model system. This estimation method provides computational time
   advantages since the dimensionality of integration in the likelihood
   function is independent of the number of latent factors. The study
   undertakes a simulation experiment within the virtual context of
   integrating residential location choice and travel behavior to evaluate
   the ability of the MACML approach to recover parameters. The simulation
   results show that the MACML approach effectively recovers underlying
   parameters, and also that ignoring the multi-dimensional nature of the
   relationship among mixed types of dependent variables can lead not only
   to inconsistent parameter estimation, but also have important
   implications for policy analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study adopts a dwelling unit level of analysis and considers a
   probabilistic choice set generation approach for residential choice
   modeling. In doing so, we accommodate the fact that housing choices
   involve both characteristics of the dwelling unit and its location,
   while also mimicking the search process that underlies housing
   decisions. In particular, we model a complete range of dwelling unit
   choices that include tenure type (rent or own), housing type (single
   family detached, single family attached, or apartment complex), number
   of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of storeys (one or multiple),
   square footage of the house, lot size, housing costs, density of
   residential neighborhood, and commute distance. Bhat's (2015)
   generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) system is used to
   accommodate the different types of dependent outcomes associated with
   housing choices, while capturing jointness caused by unobserved factors.
   The proposed analytic framework is applied to study housing choices
   using data derived from the 2009 American Housing Survey (AHS),
   sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and
   conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The results confirm the jointness
   in housing choices, and indicate the superiority of a choice set
   formation model relative to a model that assumes the availability of all
   dwelling unit alternatives in the choice set. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{NFPA 70 provides guidelines on conducting wire size rating for different
   service current ratings. Additionally, an engineering calculation method
   is provided for unusual cases. While not apparent, these guidelines are
   valid only for 60 Hz type frequencies. Electrical conductors have
   increased Joule heating with higher frequency operation because of
   electromagnetic effects like skin and proximity effects and the increase
   of total reactance of conductors and appliances. Until now, those
   effects have not been a fire safety concern, but the large increase in
   high power applications using frequencies higher than 60 Hz in variable
   frequency drives, also called adjustable frequency drives or simply ``AC
   drives{''}, to control the operation of large motors, changes this.
   While research has improved the performance of motors and AC drives,
   there has been relatively little research on the thermal effects and
   fire safety implications of these systems. In this paper we show that
   conductors used with common variable frequency power electronics have
   heat dissipation rates that can be up to 50\% larger than what is
   calculated according to the standard formulas used for 60 Hz systems.
   Using accelerated aging models for the wire insulation it is shown that
   these increases in heat dissipation rate can reduce useful cable life by
   a factor of two or more.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce the
   incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE The purpose of this
   study was to assess the impact of upstream ACEI therapy on postablation
   AF recurrence and hospitalization in patients with low left ventricular
   ejection fraction (LVEF).
   METHODS Three hundred forty-five consecutive patients undergoing first
   AF ablation with low LVEF (<= 45\%) were classified into group 1 (ACEI+,
   n = 187 {[}54\%], of whom 44 patients {[}23.5 /0] had paroxysmal AF
   {[}PAF]) or group 2 (ACEI, n = 158 {[}46 /0]; 31 of these 158 patients
   {[}19.6\%] had PAF). Additionally, 703 consecutive patients with LVEF
   >45\% undergoing first AF ablation were included for a secondary
   analysis to evaluate the effect of ACEI treatment in normal ejection
   fraction. In group 1, ACEI therapy started >= 3 months before ablation
   and continued through follow-up.
   RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar except for hypertension,
   which was significantly more prevalent in ACEI+ (71 /0 vs 51\%, P
   <.001). At 24 +/- 7 months of follow-up, 109 nonparoxysmal AF patients
   in group 1 (76\%) and 81 (64 /u) in group 2 (P =.015) were recurrence
   free. In multivariate analysis, ACEI therapy was an independent
   predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio for ACEI-, 1.7, 95\% confidence
   interval 1.1-2.7; P =.026]. However, among PAF patients, ACEI use was
   not associated with ablation success (80\% vs 77\% in ACEI+ and ACEI,
   respectively; P =.82). In the normal-EF population, the success rates
   between ACEI+ and ACEI cohorts were similar (71\% vs 74\%, P =.31).
   After the index procedure, 17 patients (9.1\%) in the ACEI+ group and 28
   (17.7\%) in the ACEI cohort (P=.02) required rehospitalization, for a
   49\% relative risk reduction (relative risk 0.51, 95\% confidence
   interval 0.29-0.90).
   CONCLUSION Preablation use of an ACEI is associated with improvement in
   ablation outcome in patients with nonparoxysmal AF with low LVEF.}},

Abstract = {{The development of metamaterials, i.e., artificially structured
   materials that interact with waves in unconventional ways, has
   revolutionized our ability to manipulate the propagation of
   electromagnetic waves and their interaction with matter. One of the most
   exciting applications of metamaterial science is related to the
   possibility of totally suppressing the scattering of an object using an
   invisibility cloak. Here, we review the available methods to make an
   object undetectable to electromagnetic waves, and we highlight the
   outstanding challenges that need to be addressed in order to obtain a
   fully functional coating capable of suppressing the total scattering of
   an object. Our outlook discusses how, while passive linear cloaks are
   fundamentally limited in terms of bandwidth of operation and overall
   scattering suppression, active and/or nonlinear cloaks hold the promise
   to overcome, at least partially, some of these limitations.}},

Abstract = {{The recoil forces characteristic of shoulder-mounted firearms can create
   discomfort and distraction for the shooter. A modified version of a
   previously developed system for measuring felt recoil was adapted to
   approximate the force interaction between gun and shooter with the aid
   of high-speed imaging. The high-speed imaging was used to find a
   combination of damping materials for the measurement system that would
   approximate the gun dynamics of a particular shooter. The recoil
   measurement system was then used to characterize the recoil of a
   gas-operated semi-automatic shotgun, comparing the recoil to a fixed
   breech version, quantifying the effect of the bolt movement on recoil
   forces. It was found that the time scale of the bolt movement relative
   to the main recoil event was important to the recoil force profile,
   increasing its duration, and for the particular gun examined, peak
   recoil forces were reduced between 20\% and 25\% by the bolt movement.}},

Title = {{Standardization Strategy for Modular Industrial Plants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},

Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Modularization is a well-established technique in which a portion of
   site-based work is exported to fabrication shops, thereby contributing
   to an improved construction. When modularization is combined with design
   standardization, according to the literature of the shipbuilding and
   manufacturing industries, the result is a leveraging opportunity. Such
   an approach can incorporate all the benefits from both design
   standardization and modularization and can constitute a strategy for
   augmenting modularization. This paper addresses a leveraging opportunity
   for modularization augmentation by examining how modularization and
   design standardization relate to one another in the industrial sector. A
   research team comprised of industrial and academic members identified
   standard modules as well as a modular standardized plant (MSP) as
   distinct approaches to combining modularization and design
   standardization. The research further identified 10 types of economic
   advantages and 3 types of economic disadvantages when the two are
   combined. Consequently, the paper documents case studies to provide
   further insight into the characteristics of modular projects with
   standard design, the assessment results of its impact and benefits, and
   the lessons learned. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{As many professionals near the traditional retirement age, organizations
   are finding themselves facing a potential mass exodus of their most
   senior and experienced employees. These potential retirees have a
   knowledge inventory accrued through a career of successes and failures
   in their fields. This knowledge base is often the foundation of
   decisions that enhance operational efficiency, foster innovation, reduce
   the occurrence of critical errors, and enable corporate growth
   strategies. This paper addresses the increased rate of knowledge loss in
   the capital projects industry. The authors conducted case studies,
   interviews, and surveys to frame the problem and understand what
   constitutes a successful experiential knowledge-retention program in
   capital projects organizations. The result is an experiential
   knowledge-retention management model that aids in the implementation of
   a corporate knowledge-retention program, assesses current risk of
   experiential-knowledge loss across organizational knowledge areas,
   identifies at-risk individuals whose departure would result in the loss
   of considerable experiential knowledge, provides a mechanism for
   effectively planning to transfer the knowledge at risk, and offers

Abstract = {{Localized cooling is widely used in treating soft tissue injuries by
   modulating swelling, pain, and inflammation. One of the primary outcomes
   of localized cooling is vasoconstriction within the underlying skin. It
   is thought that in some instances, cryotherapy may be causative of
   tissue necrosis and neuropathy via cold-induced ischaemia leading to
   nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI). The purpose of this study is to quantify
   the magnitude and persistence of vasoconstriction associated with
   cryotherapy.
   Data are presented from testing with four different FDA approved
   cryotherapy devices. Blood perfusion and skin temperature were measured
   at multiple anatomical sites during baseline, active cooling, and
   passive rewarming periods.
   Local cutaneous blood perfusion was depressed in response to cooling the
   skin surface with all devices, including the DonJoy (DJO, p = 2.6 x
   10(-8)), Polar Care 300 (PC300, p = 1.1 x 10(-3)), Polar Care 500 Lite
   (PC500L, p = 0.010), and DeRoyal T505 (DR505, p = 0.016). During the
   rewarming period, parasitic heat gain from the underlying tissues and
   the environment resulted in increased temperatures of the skin and pad
   for all devices, but blood perfusion did not change significantly, DJO
   (n.s.), PC300 (n.s.), PC500L (n.s.), and DR505 (n.s.).
   The results demonstrate that cryotherapy can create a deep state of
   vasoconstriction in the local area of treatment. In the absence of
   independent stimulation, the condition of reduced blood flow persists
   long after cooling is stopped and local temperatures have rewarmed
   towards the normal range, indicating that the maintenance of
   vasoconstriction is not directly dependent on the continuing existence
   of a cold state. The depressed blood flow may dispose tissue to NFCI.}},

Abstract = {{In most classical formulations of flow and transport through porous
   media Reynolds numbers are assumed to be small (), meaning that the role
   of inertia is considered negligible. However, many examples of practical
   relevance exist where this is not the case and inertial effects can be
   important leading to changes in flow structure and even giving rise to
   unsteady and turbulent flows as Reynolds numbers become larger. This
   change in flow structure can have a profound impact on how solutes are
   transported through the porous medium, influencing how effective
   large-scale transport should be modeled. Here we simulate, using
   high-resolution numerical models, flow and transport through an
   idealized porous medium for flow conditions over a range of Reynolds
   numbers, including steady and unsteady flows. For all these conditions
   we propose and test three upscaled models for transport-an advection
   dispersion equation, an uncorrelated spatial model (USM) and a spatial
   Markov model (SMM). The USM and SMM fall into the wider and more general
   family of continuous time random walk models. We test these models by
   their ability to reproduce pre-asymptotic and asymptotic plume second
   centered moments and breakthrough curves. We demonstrate that for steady
   flows where inertial effects are strong, the spatial Markov model
   outperforms the other two, faithfully capturing many of the non-Fickian
   features of transport, while for unsteady flows the uncorrelated spatial
   model performs best, due to the fact that unsteadiness in the flow field
   dampens the role of correlation on large scale transport. We conclude
   that correlation must be accounted for to properly upscale transport in
   steady flows, while it can be neglected in unsteady flows.}},

Title = {{Characterization and Testing of an Electrorheological Fluid Valve for

Abstract = {{Previous studies of electrorheological fluids (ERFs) were motivated by
   brake, clutch, damping, haptic and resistive applications, but never
   motivated towards developing an ERF based-hydraulic rotary actuator. One
   design to make such an actuator is to use ERF-based valves. To fully
   understand the performance of such an actuator, it is imperative to
   study ERF valves. For this reason, this paper presents a summary of
   design considerations for creating ERF-based actuators, an ERF-based
   valve design for an ERF actuator and a new experimental test-bed to
   obtain viscosity and yield characteristics of the ERF at flow rates as
   low as 0.049 L/min, an order of magnitude lower than industrial
   rheometers. The new test-bed successfully measured the dynamic viscosity
   of the ERF to be at 0.6 Pa-s for low flow rates and 0.2 Pa-s for higher
   flow rates. The presented valve design can successfully resist 1 MPa of
   fluid pressure, which is an operation mode higher than any haptic and
   damping applications in the literature. The experiments also shows that
   higher flow rates negatively affect the ERF's yield characteristics for
   the first time in a situation where the ERF valve completely blocks
   flow. When the flow rates are increased, the response time to a
   fully-closed valve increases, the effective yield capability of the ERF
   decreases and the conductivity of the ERF increases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an in-depth system-level experimental analysis
   comparing air-cooled and liquid-cooled commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
   electric motors. Typically, liquid-cooled electric motors are reserved
   for large, expensive, high-end applications where the design of the
   motor's electromagnetic components are closely coupled to its cooling
   system. By applying liquid cooling to a pre-existing motor design, this
   work helps bring the performance advantages of liquid cooling to smaller
   scale and lower cost applications. Prior work in this area gives little
   insight to designers of such systems. Conversely, this work aims to
   improve the understanding of liquid-cooled COTS motors by reporting
   empirically-observed factors of improvement for motor current, torque,
   output power and system efficiency. These measurements are obtained
   using a new liquid-cooled motor housing design that improves the ease of
   maintenance and component reuse compared to existing work. It is
   confirmed that datasheet motor thermal properties may serve as a
   reasonable guide for anticipating continuous torque performance, but may
   over-specify continuous power output. For the motor used in this test,
   continuous torque output is increased by a factor of 2.58, matching to
   within 9\% of expected datasheet values. Continuous power output is
   increased by a factor of two with only 2.2\% reduced efficiency compared
   to air-cooling.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes an image processing algorithm to identify the

   depicted in images taken from a spacecraft with an optical camera, with
   the purpose of estimating the relative distance between target and

   that in such images, the pixels belonging to the target's hard edge have
   the highest values of the image derivative; therefore, they are easily
   recognizable when the image is processed with a gradient filter.
   Eventual extraneous points polluting the dataset (outliers) are
   eliminated by two methods applied in sequence. The target center and
   radius are estimated by non-linear least squares using circular sigmoid
   functions. The proposed image processing has been applied to real and
   synthetic Moon images. An error analysis is also performed to determine

Abstract = {{The NexusHaus is the entry for the U.S. Department of Energy Solar
   Decathlon 2015 competition of the cross-cultural team The University of
   Texas at Austin (UT) and Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM). It
   demonstrates a, solar-powered and zero-water capable home designed for
   Central Texas. Its innovations serve as catalysts for change, leading
   the residential housing industry toward more sustainable practices.
   NexusHaus offers homeowners the chance to directly participate in the
   energy economy, moving from energy consumers to becoming energy
   producers. This potential source of rental income can be used to defray
   increasing property taxes. The energy and water concepts in NexusHaus
   make the house more marketable for property owners to a growing group of
   ideologically motivated people, who want to have a low-impact lifestyle.
   The target resident is also less interested in the total square footage
   of the unit but places a premium on location in a city where access to
   recreation and downtown is increasingly important. NexusHaus was
   recently voted ``Best What's Next in Austin Architecture{''} in this

Abstract = {{This research looks at coupling desalination with renewable energy
   sources to create a high-value product (treated water) from two low
   value resources (brackish groundwater and intermittent solar energy).
   Desalination of brackish groundwater is already being considered as a
   potential new water supply in Texas. This research uses Texas as a
   testbed for spatially-resolved analysis techniques while considering
   depth to brackish groundwater, water quality, and solar radiation across
   Texas to determine the locations with the best potential for integrating
   solar energy with brackish groundwater desalination. The framework
   presented herein can be useful for policymakers, regional planners, and
   project developers as they consider where to site desalination
   facilities coupled with solar photovoltaics. Results suggest that the
   northwestern region of Texas-with abundant sunshine and groundwater at
   relatively shallow depths and low salinity in areas with freshwater
   scarcity-has the highest potential for solar powered desalination. The
   range in capacity for solar photovoltaic powered reverse osmosis
   desalination was found to be 1.56 x 10(-6) to 2.93 x 10(-5) cubic meters
   of water per second per square meter of solar panel (m(3)/s/m(2)).}},

Title = {{Analyzing high resolution topography for advancing the understanding of
   mass and energy transfer through landscapes: A review}},
Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{174-193}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The study of mass and energy transfer across landscapes has recently
   evolved to comprehensive considerations acknowledging the role of biota
   and humans as geomorphic agents, as well as the importance of
   small-scale landscape features. A contributing and supporting factor to
   this evolution is the emergence over the last two decades of
   technologies able to acquire high resolution topography (HRT) (meter and
   sub-meter resolution) data. Landscape features can now be captured at an
   appropriately fine spatial resolution at which surface processes
   operate; this has revolutionized the way we study Earth-surface
   processes. The wealth of information contained in HRT also presents
   considerable challenges. For example, selection of the most appropriate
   type of HRT data for a given application is not trivial. No definitive
   approach exists for identifying and filtering erroneous or unwanted
   data, yet inappropriate filtering can create artifacts or
   eliminate/distort critical features. Estimates of errors and uncertainty
   are often poorly defined and typically fail to represent the spatial
   heterogeneity of the dataset, which may introduce bias or error for many
   analyses. For ease of use, gridded products are typically preferred
   rather than the more information-rich point cloud representations. Thus
   many users take advantage of only a fraction of the available data,
   which has furthermore been subjected to a series of operations often not
   known or investigated by the user. Lastly, standard HRT analysis
   work-flows are yet to be established for many popular HRT operations,
   which has contributed to the limited use of point cloud data.
   In this review, we identify key research questions relevant to the
   Earth-surface processes community within the theme of mass and energy
   transfer across landscapes and offer guidance on how to identify the
   most appropriate topographic data type for the analysis of interest. We
   describe the operations commonly performed from raw data to raster
   products and we identify key considerations and suggest appropriate
   work-flows for each, pointing to useful resources and available tools.
   Future research directions should stimulate further development of tools
   that take advantage of the wealth of information contained in the HRT
   data and address the present and upcoming research needs such as the
   ability to filter out unwanted data, compute spatially variable
   estimates of uncertainty and perform multi-scale analyses. While we
   focus primarily on HRT applications for mass and energy transfer, we
   envision this review to be relevant beyond the Earth-surface processes
   community for a much broader range of applications involving the
   analysis of HRT. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil water retention curve (SWRC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity
   (SHC) are key hydraulic properties for unsaturated zone hydrology and
   groundwater. Not only the SWRC and SHC measurements are time-consuming,
   but also their results are scale dependent. Although prediction of the
   SWRC and SHC from available parameters, such as textural data, organic
   matter, and bulk density have been under investigation for decades, up
   to now no research has focused on the effect of sample dimensions on the
   soil hydraulic properties pedotransfer functions development. The main
   purpose here is investigating sample internal diameter and height (or
   length) effects on the prediction of the soil water retention curve and
   the saturated hydraulic conductivity: We, therefore, develop
   pedotransfer functions using a novel approach called contrast pattern
   aided regression (CPXR) and consider the sample dimensions as input
   variables. Two datasets including 210 and 213 soil samples with known
   sample dimensions were extracted from the UNSODA database to develop and
   evaluate pedotransfer functions for the SWRC and SHC, respectively. The
   10-fold cross-validation method is applied to evaluate the accuracy and
   reliability of the proposed regression-based models. Our results show
   that including sample dimensions, such as sample internal diameter and
   height (or length) could substantially improve the accuracy of the SWRC
   and SHC pedotransfer functions developed using the CPXR method. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Energy- and materials-efficient designs are highly valued in the context
   of sustainable product design, but realizing products with significant
   changes in efficiency is a difficult task. One means to address this
   challenge is to use biological analogies during ideation. The use of
   biological analogies in the design process has been shown to greatly
   increase the novelty of concepts generated, and many authors in the
   bioinspired design (BID) community contend that efficiency-related
   benefits may be conferred as well. However, there is disagreement in the
   field as to when, how, and why efficiency-related benefits might arise
   in BIDs. This work explores these issues in-depth. A review of BID
   literature and an empirical study of BIDs lead to a better understanding
   of the types of efficiency advantages conferred by BID and set the stage
   for the development of tools and methods to systematically generate more
   energy- and materials-efficient design concepts using biological
   analogies.}},

Abstract = {{The peculiar two-dimensional structure and chemical properties of GO
   offer a facile stacking method for preparing this new type of membrane.
   In this study, GO membranes were made using the pressure-assisted
   filtration method, which was cross-linked by three diamine monomers on a
   polyethersulfone (PES) support. The prepared GO membranes had a well
   stacked layer structure that was formed by nanosheets and were stable
   because they were covalently bonded by cross-linking. The effects of
   various diamine monomers on the synthesized membrane were analyzed using
   several characterization methods, including Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic contact angle (CA) measurements, scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
   X-ray diffraction (XRD). The performance of the GO membranes for
   removing natural organic matter (NOM) was investigated in detail. The
   permeate water was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC),
   ultraviolet absorbance (UV254), molecular weight distribution (MWD) and
   fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). The results showed
   that C-N covalent bonds formed between the GO and diamine and
   effectively suppressed the interlayer spacing and stretching, which
   resulted in the best ethylenediamine performance. Overall, the ultrathin
   GO composite membrane not only effectively removed various contaminants
   from the NOM, but also qualified the water flux and fouling resistance
   performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The U.S. Energy Information Administration's Residential Energy
   Consumption Survey (RECS) provides electricity end-use estimates derived
   from disaggregating total household consumption. However, the accuracy
   of the EIA's disaggregation method is unclear, thus potentially
   producing erroneous end-use estimates and affecting respective decision
   support. In order to test the EIA's disaggregation methods, we perform
   parallel empirical analysis of residential cooling demands on two
   household samples located in Texas: an estimated sample (RECS) and a
   sample where air conditioning branch circuits are directly metered.
   Results indicate statistically significant differences between data
   sources; with the RECS sample possibly underestimating cooling demands.
   Results further indicate that models developed using observed end-use
   consumption are more robust, demonstrating statistically significant
   predictors that do not significantly correlate with end-use estimates
   from the RECS sample. We find that accounting for seasonality increases
   predicted R-2 values and reduces overestimation of statistical
   significance. Finally, the observed model indicates that window area and
   orientation are statistically significant predictors of cooling loads,
   which are parameters not surveyed in RECS. We then provide policy
   recommendations to improve end-use estimates, including integrating
   select utility-funded audit data into disaggregation methods. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Spontaneous Raman scattering measurements of temperature and major
   species concentration in hydrocarbon-air flames require detailed
   knowledge of the Raman spectra of the hydrocarbons present when fuels
   more complex than methane are used. Although hydrocarbon spectra have
   been extensively studied at room temperature, there are no data
   available at higher temperatures. Quantum mechanical calculations, when
   available are not sufficiently accurate for combustion applications.
   This work presents experimental measurements of spontaneous Stokes-Raman
   scattering spectra of methane, ethylene, ethane, dimethyl ether,
   formaldehyde and propane in the temperature range 300-860 K. Raman
   spectra from heated hydrocarbons jets have been collected with a higher
   resolution than is generally employed for Raman measurements in
   combustion applications. A set of synthetic spectra have been generated
   for each hydrocarbon, providing the basis for extrapolation to higher
   temperatures. The spectra provided here will enable simultaneous
   measurements of multiple hydrocarbons in flames. This capability will
   greatly extend the range of applicability of Raman measurements in
   combustion applications. In addition, the experimental spectra provide a
   validation dataset for quantum mechanical models. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Three-dimensional simulation of gas and dust in Io's Pele plume}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{257}},
Pages = {{251-274}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Io's giant Pele plume rises high above the moon's surface and produces a
   complex deposition pattern. We use the direct simulation Monte Carlo
   (DSMC) method to model the flow of SO2 gas and silicate ash from the
   surface of the lava lake, into the umbrella-shaped canopy of the plume,
   and eventually onto the surface where the flow leaves black ``butterfly
   wings{''} surrounded by a large red ring. We show how the geometry of
   the lava lake, from which the gas is emitted, is responsible for
   significant asymmetry in the plume and for the shape of the red
   deposition ring by way of complicated gas-dynamic interactions between
   parts of the gas flow arising from different areas in the lava lake. We
   develop a model for gas flow in the immediate vicinity of the lava lake
   and use it to show that the behavior of ash particles of less than about
   2 mu m in diameter in the plume is insensitive to the details of how
   they are introduced into the flow because they are coupled to the gas at
   low altitudes.
   We simulate dust particles in the plume to show how particle size
   determines the distance from the lava lake at which particles deposit on
   the surface, and we use this dependence to find a size distribution of
   black dust particles in the plume that provides the best explanation for
   the observed black fans to the east and west of the lava lake. This
   best-fit particle size distribution suggests that there may be two
   distinct mechanisms of black dust creation at Pele, and when two
   log-normal distributions are fit to our results we obtain a mean
   particle diameter of 88 nm. We also propose a mechanism by which the
   condensible plume gas might overlay black dust in areas where black
   coloration is not observed and compare this to the observed overlaying
   of Pillanian dust by Pele's red ring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{International low-carbon technology (LCT) transfer has emerged as a key
   focus of research and policy for global climate change mitigation
   efforts. While the benefits of international LCT transfer are widely
   understood, the processes associated with international LCT transfer are
   more complicated than is portrayed in the often-polarized discussions
   around LCT transfer. In order to effectively incentivize innovation and
   diffusion of LCTs globally, it is important to synthesize the emerging
   integrated concept of LCT transfer with due consideration to the
   dynamics of the processes underpinning it. A robust view of
   international LCT transfer requires a holistic understanding of the
   various economic, political, institutional, and legal factors that
   impact widespread transfer of LCTs. Focusing on these factors, the
   primary objective of this paper is to place the recent empirical
   literature in LCT transfer within the framework of key theoretical and
   conceptual ideas in the broader innovation and technology transfer
   literature. We organize our synthesis of this literature under three
   overarching themes: intellectual property rights; recipient country
   characteristics; and the role of international partnerships. By focusing
   on the dynamics of LCT transfer, this paper provides structured insights
   from the existing body of work, while also outlining fruitful directions
   to take in future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   simulations}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{194}},
Pages = {{97-107}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We present a software package for the non-intrusive propagation of
   uncertainties in input parameters through computer simulation codes or
   mathematical models and associated analysis; we demonstrate its use to
   drive micromechanical simulations using a phase field approach to
   dislocation dynamics. The PRISM uncertainty quantification framework
   (PUQ) offers several methods to sample the distribution of input
   variables and to obtain surrogate models (or response functions) that
   relate the uncertain inputs with the quantities of interest (QoIs); the
   surrogate models are ultimately used to propagate uncertainties. PUQ
   requires minimal changes in the simulation code, just those required to
   annotate the QoI(s) for its analysis. Collocation methods include Monte
   Carlo, Latin Hypercube and Smolyak sparse grids and surrogate models can
   be obtained in terms of radial basis functions and via generalized
   polynomial chaos. PUQ uses the method of elementary effects for
   sensitivity analysis in Smolyak runs. The code is available for download
   and also available for cloud computing in nanoHUB. PUQ orchestrates runs
   of the nanoPLASTICITY tool at nanoHUB where users can propagate
   uncertainties in dislocation dynamics simulations using simply a web
   browser, without downloading or installing any software.

Title = {{Understanding the triaging and fixing processes of long lived bugs}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{114-128}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context: Bug fixing is an integral part of software development and
   maintenance. A large number of bugs often indicate poor software
   quality, since buggy behavior not only causes failures that may be
   costly but also has a detrimental effect on the user's overall
   experience with the software product. The impact of long lived bugs can
   be even more critical since experiencing the same bug version after
   version can be particularly frustrating for user. While there are many
   studies that investigate factors affecting bug fixing time for entire
   bug repositories, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies
   investigates the extent and reasons of long lived bugs.
   Objective: In this paper, we investigate the triaging and fixing
   processes of long lived bugs so that we can identify the reasons for
   delay and improve the overall bug fixing process.
   Methodology: We mine the bug repositories of popular open source
   projects, and analyze long lived bugs from five different perspectives:
   their proportion, severity, assignment, reasons, as well as the nature
   of fixes.
   Results: Our study on seven open-source projects shows that there are a
   considerable number of long lived bugs in each system and over 90\% of
   them adversely affect the user's experience. The reasons for these long
   lived bugs are diverse including long assignment time, not understanding
   their importance in advance, etc. However, many bug-fixes were delayed
   without any specific reasons. Furthermore, 40\% of long lived bugs need
   only small fixes.
   Conclusion: Our overall results suggest that a significant number of
   long lived bugs may be minimized through careful triaging and
   prioritization if developers could predict their severity, change
   effort, and change impact in advance. We believe our results will help
   both developers and researchers better to understand factors behind
   delays, improve the overall bug fixing process, and investigate
   analytical approaches for prioritizing bugs based on bug severity as
   well as expected bug fixing effort. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Scalable and efficient algorithms for the propagation of uncertainty
   from data through inference to prediction for large-scale problems, with
   application to flow of the Antarctic ice sheet}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{296}},
Pages = {{348-368}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The majority of research on efficient and scalable algorithms in
   computational science and engineering has focused on the forward
   problem: given parameter inputs, solve the governing equations to
   determine output quantities of interest. In contrast, here we consider
   the broader question: given a (large-scale) model containing uncertain
   parameters, (possibly) noisy observational data, and a prediction
   quantity of interest, how do we construct efficient and scalable
   algorithms to (1) infer the model parameters from the data (the
   deterministic inverse problem), (2) quantify the uncertainty in the
   inferred parameters (the Bayesian inference problem), and (3) propagate
   the resulting uncertain parameters through the model to issue
   predictions with quantified uncertainties (the forward uncertainty
   propagation problem)?
   We present efficient and scalable algorithms for this end-to-end,
   data-to-prediction process under the Gaussian approximation and in the
   context of modeling the flow of the Antarctic ice sheet and its effect
   on loss of grounded ice to the ocean. The ice is modeled as a viscous,
   incompressible, creeping, shear-thinning fluid. The observational data
   come from satellite measurements of surface ice flow velocity, and the
   uncertain parameter field to be inferred is the basal sliding parameter,
   represented by a heterogeneous coefficient in a Robin boundary condition
   at the base of the ice sheet. The prediction quantity of interest is the
   present-day ice mass flux from the Antarctic continent to the ocean.
   We show that the work required for executing this data-to-prediction
   process-measured in number of forward (and adjoint) ice sheet model
   solves-is independent of the state dimension, parameter dimension, data
   dimension, and the number of processor cores. The key to achieving this
   dimension independence is to exploit the fact that, despite their large
   size, the observational data typically provide only sparse information
   on model parameters.
   This property can be exploited to construct a low rank approximation of
   the linearized parameter-to-observable map via randomized SVD methods
   and adjoint-based actions of Hessians of the data misfit functional. (C)

Abstract = {{Induced seismicity is common during hydraulic stimulation in fractured
   crystalline rock. Fluid injection pressurizes preexisting fractures,
   triggering slip and seismicity. Often, the largest induced events occur
   after the end of injection, which complicates efforts to manage seismic
   risk. In this study, a three-dimensional discrete fracture network
   simulator that couples fluid flow with earthquake simulation was used to
   investigate a novel hypothesis for why large postinjection seismic
   events occur. Fractures that form dead-end pathways differentially
   pressurize during injection. After injection is stopped, fluid backflows
   through the well from the dead-end fractures into larger fractures,
   inducing additional seismicity and potentially causing events larger
   than occurred during injection. Our simulations indicate that flowing
   fluid back to the surface immediately after injection could mitigate
   this effect and reduce postinjection seismicity.}},

Abstract = {{Optical metasurfaces, typically referred to as two-dimensional
   metamaterials, are arrays of engineered subwavelength inclusions
   suitably designed to tailor the light properties, including amplitude,
   phase and polarization state, over deeply subwavelength scales. By
   exploiting anomalous localized interactions of surface elements with
   optical waves, metasurfaces can go beyond the functionalities offered by
   conventional diffractive optical gratings. The innate simplicity of
   implementation and the distinct underlying physics of their wave-matter
   interaction distinguish metasurfaces from three-dimensional
   metamaterials and provide a valuable means of moulding optical waves in
   the desired manner. Here, we introduce a general approach based on the
   electromagnetic equivalence principle to develop and synthesize graded,
   non-periodic metasurfaces to generate arbitrarily prescribed
   distributions of electromagnetic waves. Graded metasurfaces are realized
   with a single layer of spatially modulated, electrically polarizable
   nanoparticles, tailoring the scattering response of the surface with

   splitters and a novel approach to enable broadband light absorption
   enhancement in thin-film solar cells. This concept opens up a practical

Abstract = {{While N-6-methyladenine (m(6)A) is a common modification in prokaryotic
   and lower eukaryotic genomes and has many biological functions, there is
   no simple and cost-effective way to identify a single N-6-methyladenine
   in a nucleic acid target. Here we introduce a robust, simple,
   enzyme-free and hybridization-based method using a new silver cluster
   probe, termed methyladenine-specific NanoCluster Beacon (maNCB), which
   can detect single m(6)A in DNA targets based on the fluorescence
   emission spectra of silver clusters. Not only can maNCB identify m(6)A
   at the single-base level but it also can quantify the extent of adenine
   methylation in heterogeneous samples. Our method is superior to
   high-resolution melting analysis as we can pinpoint the location of
   m(6)A in the target.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has become a standard electrolyte
   additive for use with silicon negative electrodes, but how FEC affects
   solid electrolyte interphase (SET) formation on the silicon anode's
   surface is still not well understood. Herein, SET formed from
   LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes, with and without FEC, were
   investigated on 50 nm thick amorphous silicon thin film electrodes to
   understand the role of FEC on silicon electrode surface reactions. In
   contrast to previous work, anhydrous and anoxic techniques were used to
   prevent air and moisture contamination of prepared SET films. This
   allowed for accurate characterization of the SEI structure and
   composition by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight
   secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling. These results show that
   FEC reduction leads to fluoride ion and LiF formation, consistent with
   previous computational and experimental results. Surprisingly, we also
   find that these species decrease lithium-ion solubility and increase the
   reactivity of the silicon surface. We conclude that the effectiveness of
   FEC at improving the Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention is due
   to fluoride ion formation from reduction of the electrolyte, which leads
   to the chemical attack of any silicon-oxide surface passivation layers
   and the formation of a kinetically stable SET comprising predominately
   lithium fluoride and lithium oxide.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{641}},
Pages = {{30-36}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Bulk nanostructured higher manganese silicide (HMS) samples with
   different grain size are prepared by melting, subsequent ball milling
   (BM), and followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The effects of BM
   time on the microstructures and thermoelectric properties of these
   samples are investigated. It is found that BM effectively reduces the
   grain size to about 90 nm in the sample after SPS, which leads to a
   decrease in both the thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity.
   By prolonging the BM time, MnSi and tungsten/carbon-rich impurity phases
   are formed due to the impact-induced decomposition of HMS and
   contamination from the tungsten carbide jar and balls during the BM,
   respectively. These impurities result in a reduced Seebeck coefficient
   and increased thermal conductivity above room temperature. The measured
   size-dependent lattice thermal conductivities agree qualitatively with
   the reported calculation results based on a combined phonon and diffuson
   model. The size effects are found to be increasingly significant as
   temperature decreases. Because of the formation of the impurity phases
   and a relatively large grain size, the ZT values are not improved in the
   ball-milled HMS samples. These findings suggest the need of alternative
   approaches for the synthesis of pure HMS with further reduced grain size
   and controlled impurity doping in order to enhance the thermoelectric
   figure-of-merit of HMS via nanostructuring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   -> C energy cascade will lead to good exciton collection, allowing for
   >90\% collection, even for energy donor layers up to 75 nm thick. We
   further examine how roughening the interface, increasing the exciton
   diffusion length, and using other energy cascade designs affect the
   enhancement from the energy transfer. We also propose using the inherent
   charge transfer states at the interfaces as energy acceptors and
   estimate that the Forster radius could be as large as 3.4 nm, leading to
   nearly 70\% improvement in exciton collection, without the need for a

   to these surfaces were determined, and their values decreased with
   increasing temperature. For impervious surfaces, dimensionless
   partitioning coefficients were calculated and found to be comparable to
   reported values of the octanol-air partition coefficients of phthalates,
   K-oa, suggesting that an organic film may develop on these surfaces. In
   addition, sorption kinetics was studied experimentally, and the
   equilibration time scale for impervious surfaces was found to be faster
   than that of fabric cloth. Finally, using an indoor fate model to
   interpret the measurement results, there was good agreement between
   model predictions and the observed indoor air concentrations of BBzP in
   the test house.}},

Abstract = {{We used in vitro selection to identify new DNA aptamers for two
   endocrinedisrupting compounds often found in treated and natural waters,
   17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE). We used
   equilibrium filtration to determine aptarner sensitivity/ selectivity
   and dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing to explore aptamer binding sites. The
   new E2 aptamers are at least 74-fold more sensitive for E2 than is a
   previously reported DNA aptamer, with dissociation constants (Kd values)
   of 0.6 mu M. Similarly, the EE aptamers are highly sensitive for EE,
   with K-d of 0.5-1.0 mu M. Selectivity values indicate that the E2
   aptamers bind E2 and a structural analogue, estrone (El), equally well
   and are up to 74-fold selective over EE. One EE aptamer is 53-fold more
   selective for EE over E2 or E1, but the other binds EE, E2, and E1 with
   similar affinity. The new aptamers do not lose sensitivity or
   selectivity in natural water from a local lake, despite the presence of
   natural organic matter (similar to 4 mg/L TOC). DMS probing suggests
   that E2 binding occurs in relatively flexible single-stranded DNA
   regions, an important finding for rational redesign of aptamers and
   their incorporation into sensing platforms. This is the first report of
   aptamers with strong selectivity for E2 and E1 over EE, or with strong
   selectivity for EE over E2 and E1. Such selectivity is important for
   achieving the goal of creating practically useful DNA-based sensors that
   can distinguish structurally similar estrogenic compounds in natural
   waters.}},

Title = {{From Godunov to a unified hybridized discontinuous Galerkin framework
   for partial differential equations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{114-146}},

Abstract = {{By revisiting the basic Godunov approach for system of linear hyperbolic
   Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) we show that it is hybridizable.
   As such, it is a natural recipe for us to constructively and
   systematically establish a unified hybridized discontinuous Galerkin
   (HDG) framework for a large class of PDEs including those of Friedrichs'
   type. The unification is fourfold. First, it provides a single
   constructive procedure to devise HDG schemes for elliptic, parabolic,
   hyperbolic, and mixed-type PDEs. The key that we exploit is the fact
   that, for many PDEs, irrespective of their type, the first order form is
   a hyperbolic system. Second, it reveals the nature of the trace unknowns
   as the upwind states. Third, it provides a parameter-free HDG framework,
   and hence eliminating the ``usual complaint{''} that HDG is a
   parameter-dependent method. Fourth, it allows us to rediscover most
   existing HDG methods and furthermore discover new ones.
   We apply the proposed unified framework to three different PDEs: the
   convection-diffusion-reaction equation, the Maxwell equation in
   frequency domain, and the Stokes equation. The purpose is to present a
   step-by-step construction of various HDG methods, including the most
   economic ones with least trace unknowns, by exploiting the particular
   structure of the underlying PDEs. The well-posedness of the resulting
   HDG schemes, i.e. the existence and uniqueness of the HDG solutions, is
   proved. The well-posedness result is also extended and proved for
   abstract Friedrichs' systems. We also discuss variants of the proposed
   unified framework and extend them to the popular Lax-Friedrichs flux and
   to nonlinear PDEs. Numerical results for transport equation,
   convection-diffusion equation, compressible Euler equation, and shallow
   water equation are presented to support the unification framework. (C)

Abstract = {{A new thermodynamically stable, aperiodic ``bricks-and-mortar{''} (B\&M)
   cellular mesophase structure is reported in PS1-b-(PI-b-PS2)(3) miktoarm
   copolymer and PS homopolymer blends {[}PSI, long polystyrene; PI,

   hard ``bricks{''} and PI the continuous soft ``mortar{''}. The mesophase
   is unique in its extreme domain volume fractions, its lack of positional
   order, and quasi-long-range orientational order. On the basis of this
   unusual mesophase structure, a series of PS-based thermoplastic
   elastomers are realized, combining rigidity from an exceptionally high
   content of discrete glassy PS domains (up to 82 wt \%) and high
   extensibility with recoverable elasticity from a low content of
   continuous rubbery PI (down to 18 wt \%). The new elastomers show sharp
   yielding behavior while maintaining good elasticity at large strains.
   Tensile-SAXS experiments reveal that voiding plays an important role for
   the mechanical behavior and voids can open/dose reversibly with/without
   loading. Plastic deformation only results in a slight loss of

Abstract = {{The evolution of Pt nanoparticle cathode electrocatalyst size
   distribution in a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was
   followed during accelerated stress tests using in-operando anomalous
   small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS). This evolution was compared to
   that observed in an aqueous electrolyte environment using stagnant
   electrolyte, flowing electrolyte, and flowing electrolyte at elevated
   temperature to reveal the different degradation trends in the PEMFC and
   aqueous environments and to determine the relevance of aqueous
   measurements to the stability of Pt nanoparticle catalyst in the fuel
   cell environment. The observed changes in the particle size
   distributions (PSDs) were analyzed to elucidate the extent and
   mechanisms of particle growth and corresponding mass and active surface
   area losses in the different environments. These losses indicate a Pt
   nanoparticle surface area loss mechanism controlled by Pt dissolution,
   the particle size dependence of Pt dissolution, the loss of dissolved Pt
   into the membrane and electrolyte, and, to a lesser extent, the
   re-deposition of dissolved Pt onto larger particles. Based on the
   geometric surface area loss, mass loss, and mean particle size increase
   trends, the aqueous environment best reflecting the fuel cell
   environment was found to be one in which the electrolyte is flowing
   rather than stagnant. Pt nanoparticle surface area loss resulting from
   potential cycling can be inhibited by reducing the number of particles
   smaller than a critical particle diameter (CPD), which was found to be
   similar to 3.5 to similar to 4 nm, with the CPD dependent on both the
   cycling protocol (square wave vs triangle wave) and the catalyst
   environment (fuel cell, aqueous stagnant, aqueous flowing electrolyte,
   or elevated temperature flowing electrolyte) (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are receiving great attention as the
   most promising next-generation power source with significantly high
   charge-storage capacity. However, the implementation of Li-S batteries
   is hampered by a critical challenge because of the soluble nature of the
   intermediate polysulfide species in the liquid electrolyte. The use of
   traditional porous separators unavoidably allows the migration of the
   dissolved polysulfide species from the cathode to the lithium-metal
   anode and results in continuous loss of capacity. In this study, a
   LiSICON (lithium super ionic conductor) solid membrane is used as a
   cation-selective electrolyte for lithium-polysulfide (Li-PS) batteries
   to suppress the polysulfide diffusion. Ionic conductivity issue at the
   lithium metal/solid electrolyte interface is successfully addressed by
   insertion of a soft, liquid-electrolyte integrated polypropylene
   interlayer. The solid LiSICON lithium-ion conductor maintains stable
   ionic conductivity during the electrochemical cycling of the cells. The
   Li-PS battery system with a hybrid solid/liquid electrolyte exhibits
   significantly enhanced cyclability relative to the cells with the
   traditional liquid-electrolyte integrated porous separator.}},

Abstract = {{A series of polybenzimidazoles containing sulfonyl groups were
   synthesized in Eaton's reagent for high temperature H-2/CO2 separation
   membranes. The key monomer, 3,3',4,4'-tetraaminodiphenylsulfone, was
   prepared via a novel and economical synthetic route starting from
   4,4'-dichlorodiphenylsulfone. These polybenzimidazoles with sulfonyl
   moieties had enhanced solubilities in dipolar aprotic solvents relative
   to the commercial Celazole(R) that is prepared from diaminobenzidine.
   Thermal gravimetric analysis showed that the materials were stable at
   elevated temperatures with 5\% weight loss values of at least 485
   degrees C in either air or N-2. Glass transition temperatures of three
   polybenzimidazoles in this series were ascertained by dynamic mechanical
   analysis to be 438-480 degrees C. These sulfonyl-containing
   polybenzimidazoles exhibited excellent gas separation properties for
   H-2/CO2. Polymers from tetraaminodi-phenylsulfone and either
   terephthalic or isophthalic acid crossed Robeson's upper bound for

Abstract = {{Visualizing the movement of angiocatheters during endovascular
   interventions is typically accomplished using x-ray fluoroscopy. There
   are many potential advantages to developing magnetic resonance
   imaging-based approaches that will allow three-dimensional imaging of
   the tissue/vasculature interface while monitoring other
   physiologically-relevant criteria, without exposing the patient or
   clinician team to ionizing radiation. Here we introduce a
   proof-of-concept development of a magnetic resonance imaging-guided
   catheter tracking method that utilizes hyperpolarized silicon particles.
   The increased signal of the silicon particles is generated via
   low-temperature, solid-state dynamic nuclear polarization, and the
   particles retain their enhanced signal for >= 40 minutes-allowing
   imaging experiments over extended time durations. The particles are
   affixed to the tip of standard medical-grade catheters and are used to
   track passage under set distal and temporal points in phantoms and live
   mouse models. With continued development, this method has the potential
   to supplement x-ray fluoroscopy and other MRI-guided catheter tracking
   methods as a zero-background, positive contrast agent that does not
   require ionizing radiation.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{59-69}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel framework for integrating scheduling
   and nonlinear control of continuous processes. We introduce the time
   scale-bridging model (SBM) as an explicit, low-order representation of
   the closed-loop input-output dynamics of the process. The SBM then
   represents the process dynamics in a scheduling framework geared towards
   calculating the optimal time-varying setpoint vector for the process
   control system. The proposed framework accounts for process dynamics at
   the scheduling stage, while maintaining closed-loop stability and
   disturbance rejection properties via feedback control during the
   production cycle. Using two case studies, a CSTR and a polymerization
   reactor, we show that SBM-based scheduling has significant computational
   advantages compared to existing integrated scheduling and control
   formulations. Moreover, we show that the economic performance of our
   framework is comparable to that of existing approaches when a perfect
   process model is available, with the added benefit of superior
   robustness to plant-model mismatch. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{Distributed multipoles obtained from the Gaussian electrostatic model
   (GEM) have been previously shown to be amenable for use in the AMOEBA
   force field {[}JCTC(2012) 12, 5072]. GEM distributed multipoles (GEM-DM)
   were determined for several systems including water. This previous
   AMOEBA water model with GEM-DM included only monopoles on the hydrogens
   and multipoles up to quadrupoles on the oxygen. This model showed good
   agreement with experiment for several properties at room temperature,
   but not at higher temperatures. In this contribution, we present the
   development of an AMOEBA water model using GEM-DM with distributed
   multipoles for each atomic site up to the quadrupole level. Quantum
   mechanical energy decomposition analysis has been employed to compare
   each term of the force field for parametrization. The inclusion of
   higher-order multipoles on hydrogen atoms is shown to provide better
   agreement with experiment on a number of properties including liquid
   density (rho), enthalpy of vaporization (Delta H-vap), heat capacity
   (C-p), and self-diffusion coefficient (D) for a range of temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Geometrical effects on neutron-induced gamma-ray spectroscopy logs, such
   as those arising from shoulder beds and well deviation, lead to spatial
   averaging of true layer properties which can compromise log-based
   petrophysical interpretation. Based on spectroscopy logs that have been
   corrected for geometrical effects, we introduce a workflow to quantify
   layer-by-layer matrix composition, porosity, and hydrocarbon saturation.
   Geometrical effects are reduced through nonlinear matrix inversion of
   elemental relative yields using a spectroscopy fast-forward model
   specific to a commercial logging-while-drilling (LWD) tool with a 14-MeV
   pulsed-neutron source. The spectroscopy forward model explicitly
   accounts for tool geometry, materials, and sensors, as well as
   geometrical, and borehole environmental effects on the measurements. By
   invoking linear mixing laws, the inversion method is adapted to quantify
   petrophysical properties of laminated hydrocarbon-bearing layers where
   conventional inversion methods fail because bed thickness is below the
   resolution of the LWD spectroscopy tool. Petrophysical consistency in
   estimated mineralogy is achieved by ensuring that matrix sensitive
   nuclear properties, such as gamma ray, matrix density, matrix Sigma, and
   photoelectric factor (PEF), simulated with inverted mineral volumetric
   concentrations reproduce the available measurements. Estimated mineral
   compositions are used to correct matrix effects on neutron and
   density-porosity logs, calculate matrix-corrected total porosity, and
   quantify hydrocarbon saturation through joint interpretation with
   fluid-sensitive logs. The developed interpretation workflow is
   benchmarked with synthetic and field cases to validate the accuracy and
   flexibility of the developed methods across a variety of well
   trajectories and lithologies.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal energy storage (TES) is a cost-effective technology that can
   greatly improve the performance of energy systems that have dynamic
   supply or demand. In solar thermal systems, TES plus controls enables
   the power output of the plant to be intensified and effectively
   regulated, despite fluctuating solar irradiance. In district energy
   systems, TES can be used to shift loads, allowing the system to take
   advantage of variable energy prices. The benefit of TES can be
   significantly enhanced by dynamically optimizing the complete energy
   system. The ability of TES to shift loads gives the system new degrees
   of freedom that can be exploited to yield optimal performance and
   improve thermal efficiency.}},

Pages = {{140-149}},

Abstract = {{Verifying the correctness of the executions of a concurrent program is
   difficult because of its nondeterministic behavior. One of the
   verification methods is predicate detection, which predicts whether the
   user specified condition (predicate) could become true in any global
   states of the program. The method is predictive because it generates
   inferred execution paths from the observed execution path and then
   checks the predicate on the global states of inferred paths. One
   important part of predicate detection is global states enumeration,
   which generates the global states on inferred paths. Cooper and Marzullo
   gave the first enumeration algorithm based on a breadth first strategy
   (BFS). Later, many algorithms have been proposed to improve space and
   time complexity. None of them, however, takes parallelism into
   consideration. In this paper, we present the first parallel and online
   algorithm, named ParaMount, for global state enumeration. Our
   experimental results show that ParaMount speeds up the existing
   sequential algorithms by a factor of 6 with 8 threads. We have
   implemented an online predicate detector using ParaMount. For predicate
   detection, our detector based on ParaMount is 10 to 50 times faster than
   RV runtime (a verification tool that uses Cooper and Marzullo's BFS
   enumeration algorithm).}},

Abstract = {{Natural fractures can reactivate during hydraulic stimulation and
   interact with hydraulic fractures producing a complex and highly
   productive natural-hydraulic fracture network. This phenomenon and the
   quality of the resulting conductive reservoir area are primarily
   functions of the natural fracture network characteristics (e.g.,
   spacing, height, length, number of fracture sets, orientation, and
   frictional properties); in situ stress state (e.g., stress anisotropy
   and magnitude); stimulation design parameters (e.g., pumping schedule,
   the type/volume of fluid{[}s], and proppant); well architecture (number
   and spacing of stages, perforation length, well orientation); and the
   physics of the natural-hydraulic fracture interaction (e.g., crossover,
   arrest, reactivation). Geomechanical models can quantify the impact of
   key parameters that control the extent and complexity of the conductive
   reservoir area, with implications to stimulation design and well
   optimization in the field. We have developed a series of geomechanical
   simulations to predict natural-hydraulic fracture interaction and the
   resulting fracture network in complex settings. A geomechanics-based
   sensitivity analysis was performed that integrated key
   reservoir-geomechanical parameters to forward model complex fracture
   network generation, synthetic microseismic (MS) response, and associated
   conductivity paths as they evolve during stimulation operations. The
   simulations tested two different natural-hydraulic fracture interaction
   scenarios and could generate synthetic MS events. The sensitivity
   analysis revealed that geomechanical models that involve complex
   fracture networks can be calibrated against MS data and can help to
   predict the reservoir response to stimulation and optimize the
   conductive reservoir area. We analyzed a field data set (obtained from
   two hydraulically fractured wells in the Barnett Formation, Tarrant
   County, Texas) and established a coupling between the geomechanics and
   MS within the framework of a 3D geologic model. This coupling provides a
   mechanics-based approach to (1) verify MS trends and anomalies in the
   field, (2) optimize conductive reservoir area for reservoir simulations,
   and (3) improve stimulation design on the current well in near-real-time
   and well design/stimulation for future wells.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles (diameter of approximately 5 to 50 nm) easily pass through
   typical pore throats in reservoirs, but physicochemical attraction
   between nanoparticles and pore walls may still lead to significant
   retention. We conducted an extensive series of nanoparticle-transport
   experiments in core plugs and in columns packed with crushed sedimentary
   rock, systematically varying flow rate, type of nanoparticle,
   injection-dispersion concentration, and porous-medium properties.
   Effluent-nanoparticle-concentration histories were measured with fine
   resolution in time, enabling the evaluation of nanoparticle adsorption
   in the columns during slug injection and post-flushes. We also applied
   this analysis to nanoparticle-transport experiments reported in the
   literature.
   Our analysis suggests that nanoparticles undergo both reversible and
   irreversible adsorption. Effluent-nanoparticle concentration reaches the
   injection concentration during slug injection, indicating the existence
   of an adsorption capacity. Experiments with a variety of nanoparticles
   and porous media yield a wide range of adsorption capacities (from
   10(-5) to 10(1) mg/g for nanoparticles and rock, respectively) and also
   a wide range of proportions of reversible and irreversible adsorption.
   Reversible-and irreversible-adsorption sites are distinct and interact
   with nanoparticles independently. The adsorption capacities are
   typically much smaller than monolayer coverage. Their values depend not
   only on the type of nanoparticle and porous media, but also on the
   operating conditions, such as injection concentration and flow rate.}},

Title = {{Evaluation and Performance of Packer-Type Downhole Gas Separators}},
Journal = {{SPE PRODUCTION \& OPERATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{236-242}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Advances in horizontal drilling and large fracturing technology have
   resulted in wells that produce larger volumes of oil and gas than have
   been common domestically. Artificially lifting large volumes of oil and
   associated gas to the surface has always been a problem because of the
   difficulty of separating liquid from large volumes of gas downhole,
   especially in rod-pumped wells.
   This paper describes a separation technique that uses a packing element
   to divert the formation fluids through the separator and into the casing
   annulus at the top of the separator, above the pump inlet at the bottom
   of the separator, so that the liquids and gas can separate by gravity.
   The pump seating nipple is located at the bottom of the separator so
   that the pressure drop is less in the liquids moving from the casing
   annulus to the pump intake. Better pump fillage is obtained with the
   technique of setting the pump intake at the bottom of the separator
   rather than above the long separator, as show by the field data.
   This paper also describes a quantitative technique for evaluating the
   effectiveness of downhole gas separators. Often, the evaluation of
   separator performance is based only on pump fillage and the total gas
   production from the well, instead of a comparison of the liquid fillage
   in the pump in relation to the percentage of liquid that exists in the
   casing annulus surrounding the pump.}},

Abstract = {{Natural fractures can provide preferred flow pathways in otherwise
   low-permeability reservoirs. In deep subsurface reservoirs including
   tight oil and gas reservoirs, as well as in hydrothermal systems,
   fractures are frequently lined or completely filled with mineral cement
   that reduces or occludes fracture porosity and permeability. Fracture
   cement linings potentially reduce flow connectivity between the fracture
   and host rock and increase fracture wall roughness, which constricts
   flow. We combined image-based fracture space characterization, mercury
   injection capillary pressure and permeability experiments, and numerical
   simulations to evaluate the influence of fracture-lining cement on
   single-phase and multiphase flows along a natural fracture from the
   Travis Peak Formation, a tight gas reservoir sandstone in East Texas.
   Using X-ray computed microtomographic image analysis, we characterized
   fracture geometry and the connectivity and geometric tortuosity of the
   fracture pore space. Combining level set method-based progressive
   quasistatic and lattice Boltzmann simulations, we assessed the
   capillary-dominated displacement properties and the (relative)
   permeability of a cement-lined fracture. Published empirical
   correlations between aperture and permeability for barren fractures
   provide permeability estimates that vary among each other, and differ
   from our results, vary by several orders of magnitude. Compared to
   barren fractures, cement increases the geometric tortuosity, aperture
   variation of the pore space, and capillary pressure while reducing the
   single-phase permeability by up to 2 orders of magnitude. For multiphase
   displacement, relative permeability and fluid entrapment geometry
   resemble those of porous media and differ from those characteristic of
   barren fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Interference alignment (IA) is a precoding technique that aligns
   interfering signals at receivers. It is known that IA achieves the
   maximum degrees of freedom over an interference channel under ideal
   assumptions. The real-world performance of IA depends on a range of
   practical issues, such as imperfect synchronization, channel estimation,
   and feedback. Practical issues have been studied in simulations and
   prototypes, but fully distributed operation of IA network nodes has not
   been considered. In this paper, we present the first investigation of
   real-time IA performance on a fully distributed 2 x 2
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) prototype system with three
   physically independent user pairs. Over-the-air algorithms for time and
   frequency synchronization, as well as analog feedback, are studied and
   implemented. Sum rates are illustrated as a function of complexity and
   accuracy of different alignment, synchronization, and feedback
   algorithms. Corresponding trade-offs are evaluated using an iterative IA
   method, the injection of residual frequency offset into synchronization,
   and analog versus quantization-based limited feedback approaches. We
   demonstrate that, while considering all possible error sources in
   estimation, synchronization, and feedback, the theoretical multiplexing
   gain of IA can be reached in practical systems with a constant sum rate
   loss that remains within 5 bits/Hz/s compared with an ideal simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Gene expression control is critical to increase production of
   recombinant proteins, fine-tune metabolic pathways and reliably express
   synthetic pathways. The importance of transcriptional control seems to
   be most important in eukaryotic systems. In this review, we highlight
   recent developments in the field of transcriptional engineering with an
   emphasis on the opportunities and challenges. We discuss the engineering
   of `parts' that influence transcriptional throughput including
   promoters, terminators, and transcription factors as well as the genetic
   context of the expression cassette. While great strides have been made
   in the area, the robustness of these parts has been largely untested.
   This review highlights the importance of considering robustness in
   biological systems and the limitations that current synthetic parts
   possess.}},

Abstract = {{The ensemble of antibodies found in serum and secretions represents the

   to very recent technology advancements it is now becoming possible to
   identify and quantify the individual antibodies comprising the
   serological repertoire. In parallel, the advent of high throughput
   methods for antigen and immunosignature discovery opens up unprecedented
   opportunities to transform our understanding of numerous key questions
   in adaptive humoral immunity, including the nature and dynamics of
   serological memory, the role of polyspecific antibodies in health and
   disease and how protective responses to infections or vaccine challenge
   arise. Additionally, these technologies also hold great promise for

Abstract = {{We discuss the possibility of largely enhancing the nonlinear
   second-harmonic generation (SHG) from chi((2)) nonlinear materials using
   metasurfaces consisting of suitably engineered optical nanoantenna
   arrays. The proposed setup may increase the SHG conversion efficiency by
   orders of magnitude, compared to a thin film of chi((2)) nonlinear
   material of the same thickness. This enhancement is attributed to
   localized fields at the nanoload, due to the plasmonic resonance of
   noble-metal nanoantennas, combined with a suitably enhanced photonic
   local density of states induced by properly coupling two closely spaced
   metasurfaces to form a nanocavity to enhance SHG. The proposed
   subwavelength optical device can lead to versatile applications, such as
   wavelength conversion and wave mixing at the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Duration operation was completed as the final stage of evaluating
   concentrated piperazine as a CO2 capture solvent at the Tarong pilot
   plant. For the duration tests, a single operating set-point was
   maintained for an extended period of time. The purpose of the duration
   tests was to monitor the formation of degradation products and the
   robustness of the solvent. Two duration tests were conducted that
   differed only in the regeneration temperature used (125 or 155 degrees
   C). Four hundred twenty-five hours of operation were achieved on the
   solvent with a regeneration temperature of 125 degrees C. This was
   followed by a further 421 h of operation with a regeneration temperature
   of 155 degrees C, giving a total operating time on the solvent of 1700 h
   by the end of the project. For the duration experiments, roughly 500
   tonnes of flue gas was treated, and approximately 70 tonnes of CO2
   captured. The heat stable salt (HSS) measured in highest concentration
   was formate, with the rate of formation increasing with regeneration
   temperature. The effect of pre-treatment could be seen with sulfate
   concentration in the solvent increasing sharply when caustic supply to
   the pre-treatment column was interrupted. Despite the formation of
   degradation products in the solvent regeneration energy requirements
   were not notably effected. For operation up to 1700 h on a real coal
   flue gas, no loss of plant performance was observed. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{Packaging clinically relevant hydrophobic drugs into a self-assembled
   nanoparticle can improve their aqueous solubility, plasma half-life,
   tumour-specific uptake and therapeutic potential. To this end, here we
   conjugated paclitaxel (PTX) to recombinant chimeric polypeptides (CPs)
   that spontaneously self-assemble into similar to 60 nm near-monodisperse
   nanoparticles that increased the systemic exposure of PTX by sevenfold
   compared with free drug and twofold compared with the Food and Drug
   Administration-approved taxane nanoformulation (Abraxane). The tumour
   uptake of the CP-PTX nanoparticle was fivefold greater than free drug
   and twofold greater than Abraxane. In a murine cancer model of human
   triple-negative breast cancer and prostate cancer, CP-PTX induced
   near-complete tumour regression after a single dose in both tumour
   models, whereas at the same dose, no mice treated with Abraxane survived
   for >80 days (breast) and 60 days (prostate), respectively. These
   results show that a molecularly engineered nanoparticle with precisely
   engineered design features outperforms Abraxane, the current gold
   standard for PTX delivery.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the utility of the
   mammalian swine model under simulated intensive care unit (sICU)
   conditions and mechanical ventilation (MV) for assessment of the
   trajectory of circadian rhythms of sedation requirement, core body
   temperature (CBT), pulmonary mechanics (PM) and gas exchange (GE). Data
   were collected prospectively with an observational time-series design to
   describe and compare circadian rhythms of selected study variables in
   four swine mechanically ventilated for up to seven consecutive days. We
   derived the circadian (total variance explained by rhythms of tau
   between 20 and 28 h)/ultradian (total variance explained by rhythms of
   tau between 1 and <20 h) bandpower ratio to assess the robustness of
   circadian rhythms, and compare findings between the early (first 3 days)
   and late (subsequent days) sICU stay. All pigs exhibited statistically
   significant circadian rhythms (tau between 20 and 28 h) in CBT,
   respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturation, but circadian rhythms
   were detected less frequently for sedation requirement, spontaneous
   minute volume, arterial oxygen tension, arterial carbon dioxide tension
   and arterial pH. Sedation did not appear to mask the circadian rhythms
   of CBT, PM and GE. Individual subject observations were more informative
   than group data, and provided preliminary evidence that (a) circadian
   rhythms of multiple variables are lost or desynchronized in mechanically
   ventilated subjects, (b) robustness of circadian rhythm varies with
   subject morbidity and (c) healthier pigs develop more robust circadian
   rhythm profiles over time in the sICU. Comparison of biological rhythm
   profiles among sICU subjects with similar severity of illness is needed
   to determine if the results of this pilot study are reproducible.
   Identification of consistent patterns may provide insight into subject
   morbidity and timing of such therapeutic interventions as weaning from
   MV.}},

Title = {{Chronobiologic perspectives of black time-Accident risk is greatest at

Abstract = {{Simon Folkard in 1997 introduced the phrase black time to draw attention
   to the fact that the risk of driving accidents (DA) is greater during
   the night than day in usually diurnally active persons. The 24 h
   temporal pattern in DA entails circadian rhythms of fatigue and sleep
   propensity, cognitive and physical performance, and behavior that are
   controlled, at least in part, by endogenous clocks. This opinion paper
   extends the concept of black time to reports of excess nighttime
   accidents and injuries of workers and nocturnal occurrence of certain
   man-caused catastrophes. We explore the chronobiology of work-related
   black time accidents and injuries taking into account laboratory and
   field investigations describing, respectively, circadian rhythms in
   cognitive performance and errors and mistakes by employees in the
   conduct of routine occupational tasks. Additionally, we present results
   of studies pertaining to 24 h patterns of both the number and relative
   risk (number of events per h/number of workers exposed per h) of
   work-related accidents (WRA) and injuries (WRI) as well as indices of
   performance and alertness of a self-selected homogenous survivor cohort
   of French firefighters (FFs) to explore two possible explanations of
   black time, namely, 24 h variation in sleep propensity/drossiness
   characterized by a nocturnal peak and circadian rhythms in cognitive
   performance characterized by a nocturnal trough. We propose the 24 h
   pattern of WRA and WRI, particularly of FFs and other highly skilled
   self-selected cohorts, is more strongly linked to circadian rhythms of
   fatigue and sleepiness than cognitive performance. Other possible
   explanations -suppressed expression of circadian rhythms and/or
   unmasking of ultradian periodicities in cognitive performance in
   specific circumstances, e.g., highly stressful work, competitive, or
   life-threatening settings, are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes a semi-analytical method for simulation of the
   acoustic response of multipole eccentered sources in a fluid-filled
   borehole. Assuming a geometry that is invariant with respect to the
   azimuthal and vertical directions, the solution in frequency domain is
   expressed in terms of a Fourier series and a Fourier integral. The
   proposed semi-analytical method builds upon the idea of separating
   singularities from the smooth part of the integrand when performing the
   inverse Fourier transform. The singular part is treated analytically
   using existing inversion formulae, while the regular part is treated
   with a FFT technique. As a result, a simple and effective method that
   can be used for simulating and understanding the main physical
   principles occurring in borehole-eccentered sonic measurements is
   obtained. Numerical results verify the proposed method and illustrate
   its advantages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new asymptotically exact a posteriori error estimator is developed for

   sigma(h)) be LS approximate solution for (u, sigma = -A del u). Then,
   epsilon = parallel to A(-1/2)(sigma(h) + A del u(h))parallel to(0) is
   asymptotically exact a posteriori error estimator for parallel to
   A(1/2)del(u - u(h))parallel to(0) or parallel to A(-1/2)(sigma -
   sigma(h))parallel to(0) depending on the order of approximate spaces for
   sigma and u. For epsilon to be asymptotically exact for parallel to
   A(1/2)del(u - u(h))parallel to(0), we require higher order approximation
   property for sigma, and vice versa. When both A del u and sigma are
   approximated in the same order of accuracy, the estimator becomes an
   equivalent error estimator for both errors. The underlying mesh is only
   required to be shape regular, i.e., it does not require quasi-uniform
   mesh nor any special structure for the underlying meshes. Confirming
   numerical results are provided and the performance of the estimator is
   explored for other choice of spaces for (u(h), sigma(h)). Published by

Title = {{Designing optimal mortality risk prediction scores that preserve

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Many in-hospital mortality risk prediction scores dichotomize predictive
   variables to simplify the score calculation. However, hard thresholding
   in these additive stepwise scores of the form ``add chi points if
   variable upsilon is above/below threshold t{''} may lead to critical
   failures. In this paper, we seek to develop risk prediction scores that
   preserve clinical knowledge embedded in features and structure of the
   existing additive stepwise scores while addressing limitations caused by
   variable dichotomization. To this end, we propose a novel score
   structure that relies on a transformation of predictive variables by
   means of nonlinear logistic functions facilitating smooth
   differentiation between critical and normal values of the variables. We
   develop an optimization framework for inferring parameters of the
   logistic functions for a given patient population via cyclic block
   coordinate descent. The parameters may readily be updated as the patient
   population and standards of care evolve. We tested the proposed
   methodology on two populations: (I) brain trauma patients admitted to
   the intensive care unit of the Dell Children's Medical Center of Central
   Texas between 2007 and 2012, and (2) adult ICU patient data from the
   MIMIC II database. The results are compared with those obtained by the
   widely used PRISM III and SOFA scores. The prediction power of a score
   is evaluated using area under ROC curve, Youden's index, and
   precision-recall balance in a cross-validation study. The results
   demonstrate that the new framework enables significant performance
   improvements over PRISM III and SOFA in terms of all three criteria. (C)

Abstract = {{Because of the drastically different intralayer versus interlayer
   bonding strengths, the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of
   two-dimensional (2D) materials are highly anisotropic between the
   in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The structural anisotropy may also
   play a role in chemical reactions, such as oxidation, reduction, and
   etching. Here, the composition, structure, and electrical properties of
   mechanically exfoliated WSe2 nanosheets on SiO2/Si substrates were
   studied as a function of the extent of thermal oxidation. A major
   component of the oxidation, as indicated from optical and Raman data,
   starts from the nanosheet edges and propagates laterally toward the
   center. Partial oxidation also occurs in certain areas at the surface of
   the flakes, which are shown to be highly conductive by microwave
   impedance microscopy. Using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, we also
   observed extensive oxidation at the WSe2-SiO2 interface. The combination
   of multiple microcopy methods can thus provide vital information on the
   spatial evolution of chemical reactions on 2D materials and the
   nanoscale electrical properties of the reaction products.}},

Abstract = {{A cooperative wireless network, where a cluster of K single-antenna
   transmitters jointly serve a single-antenna receiver, is considered.
   Each transmitter is connected to the control unit (CU) via independent
   but unreliable backhaul links. The CU sends a common message to each
   transmitter over backhaul links, which upon successful reception,
   jointly transmit this message to the intended receiver. To facilitate
   analysis, a general expression is derived for the complementary
   cumulative distribution function of a sum of K independent random
   variables, where each random variable is a product of an exponential and
   a Bernoulli random variable. This result is applied to find a simple
   closed-form expression that characterizes the system outage performance
   as a function of network parameters and node geometry. The analytical
   model is validated using numerical simulations. As an application, the
   derived expression is also used for investigating the impact of backhaul
   assignment on the system performance.}},

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal distribution of the near field around an antenna is
   of fundamental importance in understanding its radiative properties,
   since it can affect the radiated power flow emitted by the device. In
   this work, we consider the simplest case of a harmonic point dipole
   antenna activated at some point in time, and study the distribution of
   the energy flow velocity and reactive energy in space and time. We
   discuss how the reactive energy building up around the radiator affects
   quite strongly the flow of energy in the vicinity of the dipole, while
   in the far field, the expected radiation features are restored. The
   reactive energy in the near field decelerates or even inverts the
   overall energy flow, resulting in partial standing waves near the feed.
   We also investigate the transient response of the stored reactive energy
   and identify the convergence to steady state, which is demonstrated
   through time-averaged quantities. Our results shed interesting
   observations on the radiation properties of antennas in their near
   field, as time progresses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the detection performance of an improved energy
   detector for a secondary user with spatially correlated multiple
   antennas. In an improved energy detector, an arbitrary positive power
   operation p replaces the squaring operation in a conventional energy
   detector, and the optimum value of p that gives the best detection
   performance may be different from 2. Firstly, for a given value of p, we
   derive closed-form expressions for the probability of detection and the
   probability of false alarm when antennas at the secondary user are
   exponentially correlated. We then find the optimum value of p for two
   different detection criteria-maximizing the probability of detection for
   a target probability of false alarm, and minimizing the probability of
   false alarm for a target probability of detection. We show that the
   optimum p is strongly dependent on system parameters like number of
   antennas, antenna correlation coefficient among multiple antennas, and
   average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). From results, we infer
   that, in low SNR regime, the effect of antenna correlation is less
   pronounced on the optimum p. Finally, we find the optimum values of p
   and threshold jointly that minimize the total error rate.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{777}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Tubular vesicles in extensional flow can undergo `pearling', i.e. the
   formation of beads in their central neck reminiscent of the
   Rayleigh-Plateau instability for droplets. In this paper, we perform
   boundary integral simulations to determine the conditions for the onset
   of this instability. Our simulations agree well with experiments, and we
   explore additional topics such as the role of the vesicle's initial
   shape on the number of pearls formed. We also compare our simulations to
   simple physical models of pearling that have been presented in the
   literature, where the vesicle is approximated as an infinitely long
   cylinder with a constant surface tension and bending modulus. We present
   a complete linear stability analysis of this idealized problem,
   including the effects of non-axisymmetric deformations as well as
   surface viscosity. We demonstrate that, while such models capture the
   essential physics of pearling, they cannot capture the stability of
   these transitions accurately, since finite length effects and
   non-uniform surface tension effects are important. We close our paper
   with a brief discussion of vesicles in compressional flows. Unlike
   quasi-spherical vesicles, we find that tubular vesicles can transition
   to a wide variety of permanent, buckled states under compression. The
   idealized problem mentioned above gives the essential physics behind
   these instabilities, which to our knowledge has not been examined
   heretofore.}},

Title = {{Measurement of black carbon emissions from in-use diesel-electric
   passenger locomotives in California}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{295-303}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Black carbon (BC) emission factors were measured for a California
   commuter rail line fleet of diesel-electric passenger locomotives
   (Caltrain). The emission factors are based on BC and carbon dioxide
   (CO2) concentrations in the exhaust plumes of passing locomotives, which
   were measured from pedestrian overpasses using portable analyzers. Each
   of the 29 locomotives in the fleet was sampled on 4-20 separate
   occasions at different locations to characterize different driving
   modes. The average emission factor expressed as g BC emitted per kg
   diesel consumed was 0.87 +/- 0.66 g kg(-1) (+/- 1 standard deviation, n
   = 362 samples). BC emission factors tended to be higher for accelerating
   locomotives traveling at higher speeds with engines in higher notch
   settings. Higher fuel-based BC emission factors (g kg(-1)) were measured
   for locomotives equipped with separate ``head-end{''} power generators
   (SEP-HEPs), which power the passenger cars, while higher time-based
   emission factors (g h(-1)) were measured for locomotives without
   SEP-HEPs, whose engines are continuously operated at high speeds to
   provide both head-end and propulsion power. PM10 emission factors,
   estimated assuming a BC/PM10 emission ratio of 0.6 and a typical power
   output-to-fuel consumption ratio, were generally in line with the
   Environmental Protection Agency's locomotive exhaust emission standards.
   Per passenger mile, diesel-electric locomotives in this study emit only
   20\% of the CO2 emitted by typical gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles
   (i.e., cars). However, the reduction in carbon footprint (expressed in
   terms of CO2 equivalents) due to CO2 emissions avoidance from a
   passenger commuting by train rather than car is appreciably offset by
   the locomotive's higher BC emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   analyze children's travel mode choice to school. The new approach
   offered significant advantages, as it allowed us to incorporate three
   latent variables with a large data sample and with 10 ordinal indicators
   of the latent variables, and still estimate the model without any
   convergence problems. The data used in the empirical analysis originates
   from a survey undertaken in Cyprus in 2012. The results underscore the
   importance of incorporating subjective attitudinal variables in school
   mode choice modeling. The results also emphasize the need to improve bus
   and walking safety, and communicate such improvements to the public,
   especially to girls and women and high income households. The model
   application also provides important information regarding the value of
   investing in bicycling and walking infrastructure. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nitrosamines were synthesized in situ by addition of sodium nitrite to
   aqueous amine solutions used for CO2 capture. Amine blends containing a
   high concentration of secondary amine yielded stoichiometric quantities
   of nitrosamine. At low concentration of secondary amine, nitrosamine
   yield and rate was a function of secondary amine concentration. The
   nitrite scavengers, hydroquinone, ascorbate, cystine, and cysteine
   reduced nitrosamine yield by up to 63\%. Thermal decomposition of
   nitrosamines at 150 degrees C was first-order in nitrosamine and in the
   order: N-nitroso-piperazine (MNPZ) in 8 m piperazine (k = 26.8 +/- 1.7

Title = {{Influence of environmental factors on removal of oxides of nitrogen by a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted from combustion processes have elevated
   concentrations in large urban areas. They cause a range of adverse
   health effects, acid rain, and are precursors to formation of other
   atmospheric pollutants, such as ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and
   inorganic aerosols. Photocatalytic materials containing a semi-conductor
   that can be activated by sunlight, such as titanium dioxide, have been
   studied for their ability to remove NOx. The study presented herein aims
   to elucidate the environmental parameters that most influence the NOx
   removal efficiency of photocatalytic coatings in hot and humid climate
   conditions. Concrete samples coated with a commercially available
   photocatalytic coating (a stucco) and an uncoated sample have been
   tested in a reactor simulating reasonable summertime outdoor sunlight,
   relative humidity and temperature conditions in southeast Texas.
   Two-level full factorial experiments were completed on each sample for
   five parameters. It was found that contact time, relative humidity and
   temperature significantly influenced both NO and NO2 removal. Elevated
   concentrations of organic pollutants reduced NO removal by the coating.
   Ultra-violet light intensity did not significantly influence removal of
   NO or NO2, however, ultra-violet light intensity was involved in a
   two-factor interaction that significantly influenced removal of both NO
   and NO2.Implications: The potential for removal of oxides of NOx in
   realistic outdoor conditions by a photocatalytic coating (a stucco)
   applied on concrete was studied through full factorial experimentation.
   Results suggest that locations offering longer contact time between the
   pollutant and the reactive surface would lead to greater removal. The
   presence of elevated relative humidity reduces the NOx removal
   effectiveness of the coating. Concentrations of organic pollutants in
   the vicinity of the material did not significantly influence its removal
   effectiveness, making it potentially suitable as a control strategy for
   NO2 near roadways, where elevated NO2 levels are observed in combination
   with volatile organic compounds (VOCs).}},

Abstract = {{Here we investigate the effects of absorbing media on plasmon-enhanced
   near-field optical energy deposition. We find that increasing absorption
   by the medium results in increased particle scattering at the expense of
   particle absorption, and that much of this increased particle scattering
   is absorbed by the medium close to the particle surface. We present an
   analytical method for evaluating the spatial distribution of near-field
   enhanced absorption surrounding plasmonic metal nanospheres in absorbing
   media using a new point-by-point method. We propose criteria to define
   relevant near-field boundaries and calculate the properties of the local
   absorption enhancement, which redistributes absorption to the near-field
   and decays asymptotically as a function of the distance from the
   particle to background levels. Using this method, we performed a
   large-scale parametric study to understand the effect of particle size
   and wavelength on the near-field absorption for gold nanoparticles in
   aqueous media and silicon, and identified conditions that are relevant
   to enhanced local infrared absorption in silicon. The presented approach
   provides insight into the local energy transfer around plasmonic
   nanoparticles for predicting near-field effects for advanced concepts in
   optical sensing, thin-film solar cells, nonlinear imaging, and
   photochemical applications. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI) is a camera-based flow-imaging

   backscattered and interfering coherent fields, in terms of the accuracy
   of autocorrelation measurements, is a major unresolved issue in
   quantitative speckle flowmetry. MESI fits for a number of parameters

   from the imaged speckles. We compare the MESI-determined correlation
   times in vitro and in vivo with accepted true values from direct
   temporal measurements acquired with a photon-counting photon-multiplier
   tube and an autocorrelator board. The correlation times estimated by
   MESI in vivo remain on average within 14 +/- 11\% of those obtained from
   direct temporal autocorrelation measurements, demonstrating that MESI
   yields highly comparable statistics of the time-varying fields that can
   be useful for applications seeking not only quantitative blood flow

Abstract = {{People spend approximately one-third of their lives sleeping, where they
   can be exposed to a myriad of particle-bound biological agents and
   chemical pollutants that originate within mattresses and bedding,
   including allergens, fungal spores, bacteria, and particle-phase
   semi-volatile organic compounds. Full-scale particle resuspension
   experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber, where volunteers
   performed a prescribed movement routine on an artificially seeded
   mattress. Human movements in bed, such as rolling from the prone to
   supine position, were found to resuspend settled particles, leading to
   elevations in airborne particle concentrations. Resuspension rates were
   estimated for the size fractions of 1-2m, 2-3m, 3-5m, 5-10m, and 10-20m,
   and were in the range of 10(-3) to 10(1)h(-1). Particle size had the
   most significant impact on the resuspension rate, whereas dust loading,
   volunteer body mass, and ventilation rate had a much smaller impact.
   Resuspension increased with the intensity of a movement, as
   characterized by surface vibrations, and decreased with repeated
   movement routines. Inhalation exposure was characterized with the intake
   fraction metric. Intake fractions increased as the particle size and
   ventilation rate decreased and ranged from 10(2) to 10(4) inhaled
   particles per million resuspended, demonstrating that a significant
   fraction of released particles can be inhaled by sleeping occupants.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{With increasing gasoline prices, electric high-speed rail (HSR) systems
   represent one means to mitigate overexposure to volatile prices.
   However, additional research is needed related to funding this
   infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a new integer optimization
   model to address this problem and use a hypothetical case study to
   demonstrate the approach. The objective of the approach is to minimize
   the time period in which the cost of HSR construction and operation can
   be recovered. This is an iterative process based on an integer
   optimization model, whose objective function is to determine the optimum
   recovery time (ORT), by setting the HSR ticket price and frequency.
   Embedded in the optimization model is a multinomial logit model for
   calculating the demand for HSR as a function of these decision
   variables, thus capturing the effects of level of service on market
   share. In particular, the optimization model accounts for the role of
   different types of subsidies toward HSR construction (one-time subsidies
   at construction, annual subsidies, and subsidies depending on
   frequency). This method can also help determine whether an HSR system
   should be built or how much subsidy should be provided given a fixed
   expected cost recovery time. By integrating the logit model into the
   objective function evaluation, the effects of ticket price and service
   frequency on service demand can be directly captured. Copyright (c) 2014

Abstract = {{In the current paper, we propose a new utility-consistent modeling
   framework to explicitly link a count data model with an event-type
   multinomial-choice model. The proposed framework uses a multinomial
   probit kernel for the event-type choice model and introduces unobserved
   heterogeneity in both the count and discrete-choice components.
   Additionally, this paper establishes important new results regarding the
   distribution of the maximum of multivariate normally distributed
   variables, which form the basis to embed the multinomial probit model
   within a joint modeling system for multivariate count data. The model is
   applied to analyzing out-of-home non-work episodes pursued by workers,

Abstract = {{Seeking improvements in speed and accuracy in multiobject trajectory
   simulations, a solution methodology is presented that takes advantage of
   1) new high-fidelity geopotential and third-body perturbation models
   that efficiently trade memory for speed, and 2) a graphics processing
   unit based integrator to achieve parallelism across multiple objects.
   The two methods combined lead to multiplicative speedups, making the
   tool three orders of magnitude faster, in some cases, compared to the
   same simulation performed in serial on a single central processing unit.
   The tool is capable of Monte Carlo simulations of a single object or of
   propagating the mean and covariance of all the objects in a space
   catalog. The tool performance is demonstrated for 1) a five-day Monte
   Carlo simulation of the state uncertainty point cloud modeled with over
   one million objects, and 2) a seven-day simulation of position and
   velocity states of a full space catalog with over 250,000 objects. The
   simulations required approximately 1 and 3 h of runtime, respectively,
   on a single desktop workstation using a single-core central processing
   unit and a single graphics processing unit. The solution method is
   applicable to a variety of space situational awareness applications,
   including orbit determination, catalog maintenance, uncertainty
   propagation, and conjunction analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic orbits with respect to an object in an eccentric Keplerian
   reference orbit can be found in a variety of ways, including the use of
   Tschauner-Hempel equations and orbital element differences, which both
   admit linearized solutions, as well as through direct analyses of two
   orbits. An alternative parameterization of the last approach is proposed
   in the current study, using an inertial frame and simple geometrical
   constructs inherent to the relative motion problem. In this manner, an
   intuitive and straightforward characterization of periodic orbits is
   established that retains the nonlinear dynamics. The resulting
   multidimensional space that defines the periodic orbits is surveyed,
   archiving 336 orbits and their characteristics, and direct comparisons
   are made with the Tschauner-Hempel equations to assess the linear region
   of validity. Applications focus on resident space object (RSO)
   surveillance and circumnavigation orbits. An orbit's effectiveness is
   analyzed in terms of object coverage using coverage figures of merit,
   including the concept of ``RSO tracks{''}, the analogy of ground tracks
   on the body-fixed surface of an RSO.}},

Abstract = {{In highly flexible and integrated manufacturing systems, such as
   semiconductor manufacturing, the strong dynamic interactions between the
   equipment condition, operations executed on the equipment, and the
   resulting product quality necessitate a methodology that integrates the
   decision-making process across the domains of maintenance scheduling and
   production operations. Currently, maintenance and production operations
   decision-making are two decoupled processes. In this paper, we devise an
   integrated decisionmaking policy for maintenance scheduling and
   production sequencing, with the objective of optimizing a customizable
   objective function, while taking into account operation-dependent
   degradation models and a production target. Optimization was achieved
   using a metaheuristic method based on the results of discrete-event
   simulations of the target manufacturing system. The new approach is
   demonstrated in simulations of a generic cluster tool routinely used in
   semiconductor manufacturing. The results show that jointly making
   maintenance and production sequencing decisions consistently and often
   significantly outperforms the current practice of making these decisions
   separately.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{When an eccentrically braced frame configuration requires that the links
   be connected to the columns, standard seismic guidelines offer little
   guidance on the link-to-column connection design. Recent testing showed
   that several welded moment connection details that have been developed
   after the 1994 Northridge earthquake for special moment frames still
   cannot prevent brittle fracture in the link flange groove welds. In
   support of an experimental study on the development of reliable
   link-to-column connection details, the supplemental web doubler
   connection is proposed. The connection uses a pair of partial-height
   doubler plates that are parallel to and offset from the web in the link
   panel next to the column. Finite-element analyses were conducted to
   guide the development of design requirements, including the minimum
   reinforced length, minimum supplemental doubler thickness, and weld
   design requirement. A closed-form solution, with some minor adjustment
   based on the finite-element analysis results, for the calculation of the
   required shear force in the supplemental doublers is also proposed. A
   step-by-step design procedure is presented. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{Link-to-column connections in steel eccentrically braced frames must be
   capable of sustaining large cyclic forces and inelastic rotations.
   United States code provisions require that satisfactory performance of
   link-to-column connections be verified by testing under a prescribed
   loading protocol. However, there are few link-to-column connection
   details that have satisfied these testing criteria. This paper describes
   a pilot investigation of two promising link-to-column connection
   details, as follows: (1) the fillet welded connection, which uses fillet
   welds or a combination of fillet and groove welds between the link and
   the column flange; and (2) the supplemental web doubler connection,
   which reinforces the connection region using a pair of doubler plates in
   the first link web panel next to the column, parallel to but offset from
   the link web. These two details showed excellent performance in a series
   of eight tests. This paper describes these link-to-column connection
   details, summarizes the results of cyclic loading tests, and discusses

Abstract = {{Background and ObjectivesAtherosclerosis and plaque rupture leads to
   myocardial infarction and stroke. A novel hybrid optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) and two-photon luminescence (TPL) fiber-based imaging
   system was developed to characterize tissue constituents in the context
   of plaque morphology.
   Study Design/Materials and MethodsEx vivo coronary arteries (34 regions
   of interest) from three human hearts with atherosclerotic plaques were
   examined by OCT-TPL imaging. Histological sections (4m in thickness)
   were stained with Oil Red O for lipid, Von Kossa for calcium, and
   Verhoeff-Masson Tri-Elastic for collagen/elastin fibers and compared
   with imaging results.
   ResultsBiochemical components in plaques including lipid, oxidized-LDL,
   and calcium, as well as a non-tissue component (metal) are distinguished
   by multi-channel TPL images with statistical significance (P<0.001). TPL
   imaging provides complementary optical contrast to OCT (two-photon
   absorption/emission vs scattering). Merged OCT-TPL images demonstrate
   the distribution of lipid deposits in registration with detailed plaque
   surface profile.
   ConclusionsResults suggest that multi-channel TPL imaging can
   effectively identify lipid sub-types and different plaque components.
   Furthermore, fiber-based hybrid OCT-TPL imaging simultaneously detects
   plaque structure and composition, improving the efficacy of vulnerable
   plaque detection and characterization. Lasers Surg. Med. 47:485-494,

Abstract = {{Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a broadly utilized technology with
   many emerging applications including clinical diagnostics, sports
   medicine, and functional neuroimaging, to name a few. For functional
   brain imaging NIR light is delivered at multiple wavelengths through the
   scalp and skull to the brain to enable spatial oximetry measurements.
   Dynamic changes in brain oxygenation are highly correlated with neural
   stimulation, activation, and function. Unfortunately, NIRS is currently
   limited by its low spatial resolution, shallow penetration depth, and,
   perhaps most importantly, signal corruption due to light interactions
   with superficial non-target tissues such as scalp and skull. In response
   to these issues, we have combined the non-invasive and rapidly
   reversible method of mechanical tissue optical clearing (MOC) with a
   commercially available NIRS system. MOC utilizes a compressive loading
   force on tissue, causing the lateral displacement of blood and water,
   while simultaneously thinning the tissue. A MOC-NIRS Breath Hold Test
   displayed a approximate to 3.5-fold decrease in the time-averaged
   standard deviation between channels, consequentially promoting greater
   channel agreement. A Skin Pinch Test was implemented to negate brain and
   muscle activity from affecting the recorded signal. These results
   displayed a 2.5-3.0 fold increase in raw signal amplitude. Existing NIRS
   instrumentation has been further integrated within a custom helmet
   device to provide a uniform force distribution across the NIRS sensor
   array. These results showed a gradual decrease in time-averaged standard
   deviation among channels with an increase in applied pressure. Through
   these experiments, and the development of the MOC-NIRS helmet device,
   MOC appears to provide enhancement of NIRS technology beyond its current
   limitations. Lasers Surg. Med. 47:495-502, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{We present a comparison of different multigrid approaches for the
   solution of systems arising from high-order continuous finite element
   discretizations of elliptic partial differential equations on complex
   geometries. We consider the pointwise Jacobi, the Chebyshev-accelerated
   Jacobi, and the symmetric successive over-relaxation smoothers, as well
   as elementwise block Jacobi smoothing. Three approaches for the
   multigrid hierarchy are compared: (1) high-order h-multigrid, which uses
   high-order interpolation and restriction between geometrically coarsened
   meshes; (2) p-multigrid, in which the polynomial order is reduced while
   the mesh remains unchanged, and the interpolation and restriction
   incorporate the different-order basis functions; and (3) a first-order
   approximation multigrid preconditioner constructed using the nodes of
   the high-order discretization. This latter approach is often combined
   with algebraic multigrid for the low-order operator and is attractive
   for high-order discretizations on unstructured meshes, where geometric
   coarsening is difficult. Based on a simple performance model, we compare
   the computational cost of the different approaches. Using scalar test
   problems in two and three dimensions with constant and varying
   coefficients, we compare the performance of the different multigrid
   approaches for polynomial orders up to 16. Overall, both h-multigrid and
   p-multigrid work well; the first-order approximation is less efficient.
   For constant coefficients, all smoothers work well. For variable
   coefficients, Chebyshev and symmetric successive over-relaxation
   smoothing outperform Jacobi smoothing. While all of the tested methods
   converge in a mesh-independent number of iterations, none of them
   behaves completely independent of the polynomial order. When multigrid
   is used as a preconditioner in a Krylov method, the iteration number
   decreases significantly compared with using multigrid as a solver.

Title = {{Wireless scheduling with partial channel state information: large
   deviations and optimality}},
Journal = {{QUEUEING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{293-340}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We consider a server serving a time-slotted queued system of multiple
   packet-based flows, where not more than one flow can be serviced in a
   single time slot. The flows have exogenous packet arrivals and
   time-varying service rates. At each time, the server can observe
   instantaneous service rates for only a subset of flows ( selected from a
   fixed collection of observable subsets) before scheduling a flow in the
   subset for service. We are interested in queue length aware scheduling
   to keep the queues short. The limited availability of instantaneous
   service rate information requires the scheduler to make a careful choice
   of which subset of service rates to sample. We develop scheduling
   algorithms that use only partial service rate information from subsets
   of channels, and that minimize the likelihood of queue overflow in the
   system. Specifically, we present a new joint subset-sampling and
   scheduling algorithm called Max-Exp that uses only the current queue
   lengths to pick a subset of flows, and subsequently schedules a flow
   using the Exponential rule. When the collection of observable subsets is
   disjoint, we show that Max-Exp achieves the best exponential decay rate,
   among all scheduling algorithms that base their decision on the current
   ( or any finite past history of) system state, of the tail of the
   longest queue. To accomplish this, we employ novel analytical techniques
   for studying the performance of scheduling algorithms using partial
   state, which may be of independent interest. These include new
   sample-path large deviations results for processes obtained by
   non-random, predictable sampling of sequences of independent and
   identically distributed random variables. A consequence of these results
   is that scheduling with partial state information yields a rate function
   significantly different from scheduling with full channel information.
   In the special case when the observable subsets are singleton flows,
   i.e., when there is effectively no a priori channel state information,
   Max-Exp reduces to simply serving the flow with the longest queue; thus,
   our results show that to always serve the longest queue in the absence
   of any channel state information is large deviations optimal.}},

Title = {{Introducing non-normality of latent psychological constructs in choice
   modeling with an application to bicyclist route choice}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{341-363}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In the current paper, we propose the use of a multivariate skew-normal
   (MSN) distribution function for the latent psychological constructs
   within the context of an integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV)
   model system. The multivariate skew-normal (MSN) distribution that we
   use is tractable, parsimonious in parameters that regulate the
   distribution and its skewness, and includes the normal distribution as a
   special interior point case (this allows for testing with the
   traditional ICLV model). Our procedure to accommodate non-normality in
   the psychological constructs exploits the latent factor structure of the
   ICLV model, and is a flexible, yet very efficient approach (through
   dimension-reduction) to accommodate a multivariate non-normal structure
   across all indicator and outcome variables in a multivariate system
   through the specification of a much lower-dimensional multivariate
   skew-normal distribution for the structural errors. Taste variations
   (i.e., heterogeneity in sensitivity to response variables) can also be
   introduced efficiently and in a non-normal fashion through interactions
   of explanatory variables with the latent variables. The resulting model
   we develop is suitable for estimation using Bhat's (2011) maximum
   approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) inference approach.
   The proposed model is applied to model bicyclists' route choice behavior
   using a web-based survey of Texas bicyclists. The results reveal
   evidence for non-normality in the latent constructs. From a substantive
   point of view, the results suggest that the most unattractive features
   of a bicycle route are long travel times (for commuters), heavy
   motorized traffic volume, absence of a continuous bicycle facility, and
   high parking occupancy rates and long lengths of parking zones along the
   route. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific evaluation of prototyping practices is an emerging field in
   design research. Prototyping is critical to the success of product
   development efforts, and yet its implementation in practice is often
   guided by ad hoc experience. To address this need, we seek to advance
   the study and development of prototyping principles, techniques, and
   tools. A method to repeatedly enhance the outcome of prototyping efforts
   is reported in this paper. The research methodology to develop this
   method is as follows: (1) systematically identify practices that improve
   prototyping; (2) synthesize these practices to form a guiding method for
   designers; and (3) validate that the proposed method encourages best
   practices and improves performance. Prototyping practices are
   represented as six key heuristics to guide a designer in planning: how
   many iterations to pursue, how many unique design concepts to explore in
   parallel, as well as the use of scaled prototypes, isolated subsystem
   prototypes, relaxed requirements, and virtual prototypes. The method is
   correlated, through experimental investigation, with increased
   application of these best practices and improved design performance
   outcomes. These observations hold across various design problems
   studied. This method is novel in providing a systematic approach to
   prototyping.}},

Abstract = {{A general approach is given to extend WENO reconstructions to a class of
   numerical schemes that use different types of moments (i.e.,
   multi-moments) simultaneously as the computational variables, such as
   point values and grid cell averages. The key is to re-map the
   multi-moment values to single moment values (e.g., cell average or point
   values), which can then be used to invoke known, standard reconstruction
   coefficients and smoothness indicators for single moment WENO
   reconstructions. The WENO reconstructions in turn provide the numerical
   approximations for the flux functions and other required quantities. One
   major advantage of using multi-moments for WENO reconstructions is its
   compactness. We present two new multi-moment WENO (MM-WENO) schemes of
   fifth order that use reconstructions supported over only three grid
   cells, as opposed to the usual five. This is similar to the Hermite WENO
   schemes of Qiu and Shu (J Comput Phys 193:115-135, 2003), which can also
   be derived using our general approach. Numerical tests demonstrate that
   the new schemes achieve their designed fifth order accuracy and
   eliminate spurious oscillations effectively. The numerical solutions to
   all benchmark tests are of good quality and comparable to the classic,
   single moment WENO scheme of the same order of accuracy. The basic idea
   presented in this paper is universal, which makes the WENO
   reconstruction an easy-to-follow method for developing a wide variety of
   additional multi-moment numerical schemes.}},

Abstract = {{An adequate identification of antecedents is recognized as fundamental
   in order to set the basis for connecting the inter-organizational
   networks in a SCM perspective. This work aims to identify key
   antecedents of SCM in a project-based environment by using Interpretive
   Structural Modelling (ISM). This is firstly useful in order to highlight
   the relationships among the antecedents and to deduce priority for their
   achievement. The findings provide a hierarchical perspective of the 16
   identified antecedents. In particular, three macro-classes of
   prerequisites were defined: cross-organizational cooperation, rules and
   procedures accessibility, and super-ordinate goals. Moreover, results
   from a longitudinal and illustrative case study are also presented in
   order to compare the out-coming ISM model with evidence from a success
   case in the Yacht-building context so offering interesting insights
   about the implementation process. From a managerial perspective, the
   proposed model offers a conceptual path for SCM adoption, emphasizing
   most critical issues that have to be considered and organized in this
   complex and unpredictable setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Abstract = {{Nanoparticulate Ag films have been produced by the laser ablation of
   microparticle aerosol (LAMA) deposition process. LAMA enables the
   production of thick, nanoparticulate films that are free of organics and
   offers the ability to control the degree of agglomeration and initial
   film density. The films were subsequently annealed at a range of
   temperatures from 100A degrees C to 250A degrees C to densify the films
   and increase conductivity. We show that, by reducing the degree of
   agglomeration in the films, sintering of LAMA-produced films occurs at
   low temperatures and results in near fully dense Ag films that exhibit
   an order of magnitude higher conductivity when compared to thick films
   produced by other techniques that are sintered at similar temperatures.
   Good agreement is observed between experiments and a sintering model
   that suggests that surface diffusion is dominant at temperatures below
   150A degrees C, and a combination of surface and grain boundary
   diffusion are responsible for sintering at slightly higher temperatures.}},

   Fracture of Hydrogels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogels are used in a variety of applications ranging from tissue
   engineering to soft robotics. They often undergo large deformation
   coupled with solvent diffusion, and structural integrity is important
   when they are used as structural components. This paper presents a
   thermodynamically consistent method for calculating the transient energy
   release rate for crack growth in hydrogels based on a modified
   path-independent J-integral. The transient energy release rate takes
   into account the effect of solvent diffusion, separating the energy lost
   in diffusion from the energy available to drive crack growth. Numerical
   simulations are performed using a nonlinear transient finite element
   method for center-cracked hydrogel specimens, subject to remote tension
   under generalized plane strain conditions. The hydrogel specimen is
   assumed to be either immersed in a solvent or not immersed by imposing
   different chemical boundary conditions. Sharp crack and rounded notch
   models are used for small and large far-field strains, respectively.
   Comparisons to linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) are presented
   for the crack-tip fields and crack opening profiles in the instantaneous
   and equilibrium limits. It is found that the stress singularity at the
   crack tip depends on both the far-field strain and the local solvent
   diffusion, and the latter evolves with time and depends on the chemical
   boundary conditions. The transient energy release rate is predicted as a
   function of time for the two types of boundary conditions with distinct
   behaviors due to solvent diffusion. Possible scenarios of delayed
   fracture are discussed based on evolution of the transient energy
   release rate.}},

Title = {{Mixed-Mode Interactions Between Graphene and Substrates by Blister Tests}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Many of the attractive properties of graphene will only be realized when
   it can be mass produced. One bottleneck is the efficient transfer of
   graphene between various substrates in nanomanufacturing processes such
   as roll-to-roll and transfer printing. In such processes, it is
   important to understand how the ratio of shear-to-tension at the
   interface between graphene and substrates affects the adhesion energy.
   With this in mind, this paper examines the mixed-mode adhesive
   interactions between chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene that
   had been transferred to copper or silicon substrates. The approach that
   was taken was to use blister tests with a range of graphene backing
   layer materials and thicknesses in order to provide a wide range of the
   shear-to-tension ratio or fracture mode-mix at the interface. Raman
   spectroscopy was used to ensure that graphene had indeed been
   delaminated from each substrate. Measurements of pressure, top surface
   deflection, and blister diameter were coupled with fracture mechanics
   analyses to obtain the delamination resistance curves and steady state
   adhesion energy of each interface. The results showed that the adhesive
   interactions between graphene and both substrates (Cu and Si) had a
   strong dependence on the fracture mode-mix. In the absence of plasticity
   effects, the most likely explanation of this effect is asperity locking
   from the inherent surface roughness of the substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Passive properties of the human hands, defined by the joint stiffness
   and damping, play an important role in hand biomechanics and
   neuromuscular control. Introduction of mechanical element that generates
   humanlike passive properties in a robotic form may lead to improved
   grasping and manipulation abilities of the next generation of robotic
   hands. This paper presents a novel mechanism, which is designed to
   conduct experiments with the human subjects in order to develop
   mathematical models of the passive properties at the metacarpophalangeal
   (MCP) joint. We designed a motor-driven system that integrates with a
   noninvasive and infrared motion capture system, and can control and
   record the MCP joint angle, angular velocity, and passive forces of the
   MCP joint in the index finger. A total of 19 subjects participated in
   the experiments. The modular and adjustable design was suitable for
   variant sizes of the human hands. Sample results of the viscoelastic
   moment, hysteresis loop, and complex module are presented in the paper.
   We also carried out an error analysis and a statistical test to validate
   the reliability and repeatability of the mechanism. The results show
   that the mechanism can precisely collect kinematic and kinetic data
   during static and dynamic tests, thus allowing us to further understand
   the insights of passive properties of the human hand joints. The
   viscoelastic behavior of the MCP joint showed a nonlinear dependency on
   the frequency. It implies that the elastic and viscous component of the
   hand joint coordinate to adapt to the external loading based on the
   applied frequency. The findings derived from the experiments with the
   mechanism can provide important guidelines for design of humanlike
   compliance of the robotic hands.}},

   household-level data and of incorporating economic as well as social and
   behavioral factors on model outcomes. Our goal is to identify features
   of the model that are most critical to successful prediction of the
   temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns that characterize the
   technology adoption process for solar PV. Agent variables, topology, and
   environment are derived from detailed and comprehensive real-world data
   between 2004 and 2013 in Austin (Texas, USA). Four variations of the
   model are developed, each with a different level of complexity and
   empirical characterization. We find that while an explicit focus only on
   the financial aspects of the solar PV adoption decision performs well in
   predicting the rate and scale of adoption, accounting for agent-level
   attitude and social interactions are critical for predicting spatial and
   demographic patterns of adoption with high accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   modeling}},

Volume = {{70}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Inverse modeling is an essential step for reliable modeling of
   subsurface flow and transport, which is important for groundwater
   resource management and aquifer remediation. Multiple-point statistics
   (MPS) based reservoir modeling algorithms, beyond traditional two-point
   statistics-based methods, offer an alternative to simulate complex
   geological features and patterns, conditioning to observed conductivity
   data. Parameter estimation, within the framework of MPS, for the
   characterization of conductivity fields using measured dynamic data such
   as piezometric head data, remains one of the most challenging tasks in
   geologic modeling. We propose a new local global pattern matching method
   to integrate dynamic data into geological models. The local pattern is
   composed of conductivity and head values that are sampled from joint
   training images comprising of geological models and the corresponding
   simulated piezometric heads. Subsequently, a global constraint is
   enforced on the simulated geologic models in order to match the measured
   head data. The method is sequential in time, and as new piezometric head
   become available, the training images are updated for the purpose of
   reducing the computational cost of pattern matching. As a result, the
   final suite of models preserve the geologic features as well as match
   the dynamic data. This local global pattern matching method is
   demonstrated for simulating a two-dimensional, bimodally-distributed
   heterogeneous conductivity field. The results indicate that the
   characterization of conductivity as well as flow and transport
   predictions are improved when the piezometric head data are integrated
   into the geological modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Agent-based modeling (ABM) techniques for studying human-technical
   systems face two important challenges. First, agent behavioral rules are
   often ad hoc, making it difficult to assess the implications of these
   models within the larger theoretical context. Second, the lack of
   relevant empirical data precludes many models from being appropriately
   initialized and validated, limiting the value of such models for
   exploring emergent properties or for policy evaluation. To address these
   issues, in this paper we present a theoretically-based and
   empirically-driven agent-based model of technology adoption, with an
   application to residential solar photovoltaic (PV). Using
   household-level resolution for demographic, attitudinal, social network,
   and environmental variables, the integrated ABM framework we develop is
   applied to real-world data covering 2004-2013 for a residential solar PV
   program at the city scale. Two applications of the model focusing on
   rebate program design are also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper we have investigated the ripples in graphenes under
   thermal agitation. It is known that as temperature increases ripples
   originate in the flat landscape of a graphene sheet which is responsible
   for changing its properties. Among a limited number of works available
   in literature the role of length scales and temperature on the
   characteristics of the ripples has been investigated. However it is
   important to include the boundary conditions with other parameters in
   order to get a broader picture. In this work graphenes with three
   different sizes (2 nm, 10 nm and 50 nm) were considered under both
   simply supported and free-opposite-sides boundary conditions at
   different temperatures (e.g. 10 K, 100 K and 500 K) using molecular
   dynamics simulations. The variation in natural frequencies and their
   dependency on the boundary condition, length scale and temperature was
   thoroughly studied. Change in the boundary condition can introduce new
   modes of vibrations in graphenes. A combined effect of length scale,
   boundary condition and temperature was shown to be responsible for
   developing the geometrical patterns in the ripples. With
   free-opposite-sides boundary conditions the ripples are more harmonic in
   larger graphene than other cases. It was also noticed that the
   probability distribution for the off-plane displacements of the carbon
   atoms in graphene is typically non-stationary at small length scales.
   Variation in boundary conditions and length scales may affect the
   kurtosis of the distribution. The results showed adequate agreement with
   available data in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{292}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{We consider a second order elliptic problem with a heterogeneous
   coefficient, which models, for example, single phase flow through a
   porous medium. We write this problem in mixed form and approximate it
   for parallel computation using the multiscale mortar domain
   decomposition mixed finite element method, which gives rise to a saddle
   point linear system. We use a relatively fine mortar space, which allows
   us to enforce continuity of the normal velocity flux, or nearly so in
   the case of nonmatching meshes. To solve the Schur complement linear
   system for the mortar unknowns, we propose a two-level preconditioner
   based on the interfaces between subdomains. The coarse preconditioner
   also uses the multiscale mortar domain decomposition method, but with
   instead a very coarse mortar space. We show that the prolongation
   operator of the coarse mortar to the fine is defined uniquely by the
   condition that the L-2-projection of a coarse mortar agrees with its
   projection onto the space of normal velocity fluxes, i.e., no energy is
   introduced when changing mortar scales. The local smoothing
   preconditioner is based on block Jacobi, using blocks defined by the
   interfaces. We use restrictive smoothing domains that are smaller normal
   to the interfaces, and overlapping in the directions tangential to the
   interfaces. In the simplest case, the condition number of the
   preconditioned interface operator is bounded by a multiple of (log(1 +
   H/h))(2). We show several numerical examples involving strongly
   heterogeneous porous media to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness
   of the preconditioner. We see that it is often desirable, and sometimes
   necessary, to use a piecewise linear or higher order coarse mortar space
   to achieve good convergence for heterogeneous problems. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Injection of concentrated bentonite suspensions into granular soils is
   one of the effective methods to improve the stability of the soil
   deposits against earthquake-induced liquefaction. While the constitutive
   model parameters of the suspensions are crucial to characterize their
   flow through granular soils, the determination of the model parameters
   is challenging because the flow characteristics of the bentonite
   suspensions vary with the amount of ionic additives and resting time.
   The objective of this study is to investigate the constitutive model
   parameters of concentrated bentonite suspensions modified with sodium
   pyrophosphate (SPP) in the context of their flow through granular soils
   and stability over time. 7.5, 10, and 12 wt\% bentonite suspensions were
   tested at 0-7 wt\% SPP concentrations. The time-dependent behavior of 10
   wt\% suspensions was also monitored at various resting times. Yield
   stress, flow consistency index (K) (or plastic viscosity), and flow
   behavior index (n) were determined by matching the experimental data to
   the Herschel-Bulkley or Bingham model. The results show that the yield
   stresses of the suspensions reach approximately 1 Pa at 1, 2, and 4 wt\%
   SPP for the 7.5, 10, and 12 wt\% suspensions, respectively. The K values
   increase sharply and then decrease with the increase of SPP
   concentration. The n values decrease with the initial dosage of the SPP,
   but increase with the additional amount of the SPP, converging to
   approximately 0.8. The yield stress of SPP-modified suspensions
   increases over resting time and the n values converge to 1. The critical
   storage modulus of the modified suspensions increases as yield stress
   increases, producing a strong time-independent correlation with yield
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{Existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods are mostly
   opinion-aware. They learn regression models from training images with
   associated human subjective scores to predict the perceptual quality of

   variety of distortion types. The BIQA models learned by opinion-aware
   methods often have weak generalization capability, hereby limiting their
   usability in practice. By comparison, opinion-unaware methods do not
   need human subjective scores for training, and thus have greater
   potential for good generalization capability. Unfortunately, thus far no
   opinion-unaware BIQA method has shown consistently better quality
   prediction accuracy than the opinion-aware methods. Here, we aim to
   develop an opinion-unaware BIQA method that can compete with, and
   perhaps outperform, the existing opinion-aware methods. By integrating
   the features of natural image statistics derived from multiple cues, we
   learn a multivariate Gaussian model of image patches from a collection
   of pristine natural images. Using the learned multivariate Gaussian
   model, a Bhattacharyya-like distance is used to measure the quality of
   each image patch, and then an overall quality score is obtained by
   average pooling. The proposed BIQA method does not need any distorted
   sample images nor subjective quality scores for training, yet extensive
   experiments demonstrate its superior quality-prediction performance to
   the state-of-the-art opinion-aware BIQA methods. The MATLAB source code
   of our algorithm is publicly available at www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/similar
   to cslzhang/IQA/ILNIQE/ILNIQE.htm.}},

Title = {{Detection and Quantification of Three-Dimensional Hydraulic Fractures
   With Horizontal Borehole Resistivity Measurements}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the suitability of low-frequency borehole
   resistivity measurements for detecting and appraising hydraulic
   fractures. The effects of the borehole logging tool's
   transmitter-receiver spacing, orientation, and operating frequency, as
   well as the fracture's shape, cross-sectional area, dip, and
   electrical-conductivity contrast with the embedding formation, are
   quantified using an fast Fourier transform (FFT)-accelerated
   integral-equation solver. Simulation results for a logging tool that
   consists of one transmitter and two receivers in a homogeneous shale
   formation of 1/3 S/m conductivity show the following: 1) Longer
   transmitter-receiver spacings can differentiate larger fractures, while
   shorter transmitter-receiver spacings can detect smaller fractures;
   specifically, the tool can differentiate fractures up to similar to 1000
   m(2) in area if the receivers are 18 and 19.2 m away from the
   transmitter, but this long-spacing configuration cannot detect fractures
   smaller than similar to 10 m(2) in area and requires the effective
   electrical conductivity of the fracture to be larger than 100 S/m. In
   comparison, the tool can detect fractures as small as similar to 1000
   m(2) in area if the receivers are 1.2 and 1.5 m away from the
   transmitter even if the effective electrical conductivity of the
   fracture is only 10 S/m, but this short-spacing configuration cannot
   distinguish fractures larger than similar to 10 m(2) in area. 2) Coaxial
   measurements are sensitive to the fracture cross-sectional area but
   cannot differentiate fractures of the same area with different
   cross-sectional shapes or dips. Transverse copolarized measurements can
   discern axially symmetric fractures from asymmetric ones; for example,
   in long-spacing configuration, they can differentiate elliptical
   fractures with an aspect ratio of 8 from circular or square fractures if
   their areas are within similar to 1 m(2) to similar to 1000 m(2).
   Cross-polarized measurements can quantify fracture dip and become more
   sensitive as the dip angle increases; for example, in long-spacing
   configuration, they can detect 15. dipping fractures that are larger
   than similar to 1000 m(2) in area but cannot distinguish them, while
   they can detect and distinguish 60. dipping fractures if their areas are
   in the range of similar to 100-1000 m(2). 3) The measurements are mostly
   insensitive to the operating frequency in the 10 Hz-1 kHz range in the
   short-spacing configuration and depend moderately on the operating
   frequency in the long-spacing configuration. 4) The relative strength of
   the measured signals is proportional to the fracture effective
   electrical conductivity when the fracture is more than ten times
   conductive compared to the embedding rock formation. 5) Short-spacing
   measurements exhibit higher resolution; the tool can differentiate two
   fractures as long as they are more than similar to 1 m (4 m) away from
   each other in the short-spacing (long-spacing) configuration. 6) In
   complex fracture networks, not only major branches but intermediate and
   small branches contribute to the shape and magnitude of measured
   signals; the contributions depend mainly on the area and position of the
   branches.}},

Abstract = {{The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of concrete is one of the
   important concrete properties that is responsible for the deterioration

   CTE reduction also improves the durability and longevity. CTE of
   concrete is dependent on the CTE of its constituents. Replacing high-CTE
   aggregates with low-CTE aggregates can significantly reduce the CTE of
   overall concrete. In addition, concrete CTE can be reduced by reducing
   the cement paste volume. This study presented systematic guideline to
   select the concrete constituents to achieve a target CTE. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator transistors were fabricated using
   two different metal gate deposition mechanisms to compare plasma damage
   effects on gate oxide quality. Devices fabricated with both
   plasma-enhanced atomic-layer-deposited (PE-ALD) TiN gates and magnetron
   plasma sputtered TiN gates showed very good electrostatics and
   short-channel characteristics. However, the gate oxide quality was
   markedly better for PE-ALD TiN. A significant reduction in interface
   state density was inferred from capacitance-voltage measurements as well
   as a 1200 x reduction in gate leakage current. A high-power magnetron
   plasma source produces a much higher energetic ion and vacuum
   ultra-violet (VUV) photon flux to the wafer compared to a low-power
   inductively coupled PE-ALD source. The ion and VUV photons produce
   defect states in the bulk of the gate oxide as well as at the
   oxide-silicon interface, causing higher leakage and potential
   reliability degradation. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Effect of frequency on microplasmas driven by microwave excitation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{The effect of excitation frequency on the breakdown voltage of a
   microwave (mw) microdischarge and its steady-state plasma parameters is
   studied by the self-consistent one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell Monte
   Carlo collisions model. It is found that for microdischarges in which
   the electron wall losses are significant, an increase in the mw
   frequency results in a decrease in the breakdown voltage. For conditions
   in which the electron wall losses become negligible, an increase in the
   frequency does not influence significantly the breakdown voltage. At the
   same time, for both regimes, the increase in the frequency results in an
   increase in the steady-state plasma density. The analysis of the
   steady-state plasma parameters have shown that the dominant electron
   heating mechanism is the Joule heating while the stochastic heating is
   negligible. Also, it is found that the electron energy distribution
   function consists of two electron groups, namely, slow and fast
   electrons. The presence of fast electrons in the plasma bulk indicates
   the non-local nature of microwave excited microdischarges. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Glycerides are of interest to the areas of food science and medicine
   because they are the main component of fat. From a chemical sensing
   perspective, glycerides are challenging analytes because they are
   structurally similar to one another and lack diversity in terms of
   functional groups. Furthermore, because animal and plant fat consists of
   a number of stereo-and regioisomeric acylglycerols, their components
   remain challenging analytes for chromatographic and mass spectrometric
   determination, particularly the quantitation of species in mixtures. In
   this study, we demonstrated the use of an array of cross-reactive serum
   albumins and fluorescent indicators with chemometric analysis to
   differentiate a panel of mono-, di-, and triglycerides. Due to the
   difficulties in identifying the regio-and stereochemistry of the
   unsaturated glycerides, a sample pretreatment consisting of olefin
   cross-metathesis with an allyl fluorescein species was used before array
   analysis. Using this simple assay, we successfully discriminated 20
   glycerides via principal component analysis and linear discriminant
   analysis (PCA and LDA, respectively), including stereo-and regioisomeric
   pairs. The resulting chemometric patterns were used as a training space
   for which the structural characteristics of unknown glycerides were
   identified. In addition, by using our array to perform a standard
   addition analysis on a mixture of triglycerides and using a method
   introduced herein, we demonstrated the ability to quantitate glyceride
   components in a mixture.}},

Title = {{Mapping Systemic Risk: Critical Degree and Failures Distribution in
   Financial Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{The financial crisis illustrated the need for a functional understanding
   of systemic risk in strongly interconnected financial structures.
   Dynamic processes on complex networks being intrinsically difficult to
   model analytically, most recent studies of this problem have relied on
   numerical simulations. Here we report analytical results in a network
   model of interbank lending based on directly relevant financial
   parameters, such as interest rates and leverage ratios. We obtain a
   closed-form formula for the ``critical degree{''} (the number of
   creditors per bank below which an individual shock can propagate
   throughout the network), and relate failures distributions to network
   topologies, in particular scalefree ones. Our criterion for the onset of
   contagion turns out to be isomorphic to the condition for cooperation to
   evolve on graphs and social networks, as recently formulated in
   evolutionary game theory. This remarkable connection supports recent
   calls for a methodological rapprochement between finance and ecology.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we display one-step reactions under autogenic pressure at

   nanorods by varying the atomic ratio of Mn:Ga as 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and
   0.08, respectively. The synthesised nanorods are characterised by X-ray
   diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
   and Raman spectral methods. It is observed that there is a decrease in
   the lattice constant with an increase in the concentration of Mn (from
   0.02 to 0.08wt\%). Moreover, the smaller covalent radius of Mn is the
   key for the doping process. The Mn-doped GaN nanocrystals show rod-like
   morphology with a length of 40-50nm and width of 8-12nm. This size
   factor mainly depends on the doping of Mn {[}from transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) analysis] into GaN components. Well-defined lattice
   fringes are elucidated for the growth of crystalline hexagonal GaN
   (wurtzite type) nanocrystals.}},

Title = {{How Local and Average Particle Diffusivities of Inhomogeneous Fluids
   Depend on Microscopic Dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{9103-9113}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Computer simulations and a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation based
   approach are used to compare the single-particle diffusion coefficients
   of equilibrium hard-sphere fluids exhibiting identical inhomogeneous
   static structure and governed by either Brownian (i.e., overdamped
   Langevin) or Newtonian microscopic dynamics. The physics of
   inhomogeneity is explored via the imposition of one-dimensional
   sinusoidal density profiles of different wavelengths and amplitudes.
   When imposed density variations are small in magnitude for distances on
   the scale of a particle diameter, bulk-like average correlations between
   local structure and mobility are observed. In contrast, when density
   variations are significant on that length scale, qualitatively different
   structure-mobility correlations emerge that are sensitive to the
   governing microscopic dynamics. Correspondingly, a previously proposed
   scaling between long-time diffusivities for bulk isotropic fluids of
   particles exhibiting Brownian versus Newtonian dynamics {[}Pond et al.
   Soft Matter 2011, 7, 9859-9862] cannot be generalized to describe the
   position-dependent behaviors of strongly inhomogeneous fluids. While
   average diffusivities in the inhomogeneous and homogeneous directions
   are coupled, their qualitative dependencies on inhomogeneity wavelength
   are sensitive to the details of the microscopic dynamics. Nonetheless,
   average diffusivities of the inhomogeneous fluids can be approximately
   predicted for either type of dynamics based on knowledge of bulk
   isotropic fluid behavior and how inhomogeneity modifies the distribution
   of available volume. Analogous predictions for average diffusivities of
   experimental, inhomogeneous colloidal dispersions (based on known bulk
   behavior) suggest that they will exhibit qualitatively different trends
   than those predicted by models governed by overdamped Langevin dynamics
   that do not account for hydrodynamic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Solution-processed films of colloidal aliovalent niobium-doped anatase
   TiO2 nanocrystals exhibit modulation of optical transmittance in two
   Spectral regions near-infrared (NIR) and visible light as they undergo
   progressive and reversible charging in an electrochemical cell. The
   Nb-TiO2 nano crystal film supports a localized surface plasmon resonance
   in the NIR, which can be dynamically modulated via capacitive charging.
   When the nanocrystals are charged by insertion of lithium ions, inducing
   a well-known structural phase transition of the anatase lattice, strong
   modulation of visible transmittance is observed. Based on X-ray
   absorption near-edge spectroscopy, the conduction electrons localize
   only upon lithium ion insertion, thus rationalizing the two modes of
   optical switching observed in a single material. These multimodal
   electrochromic properties show promise for application in dynamic
   optical filters or smart windows.}},

Abstract = {{The size-dependent optical gap due to the quantum confinement effect is
   a hallmark of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). A major research effort
   underway is to control energy transfer in QDs for diverse applications
   ranging from solar energy harvesting to fluorescent displays and
   biological imaging. In this work, we report an innovative approach for
   fabricating monodispersed arrays of Au/polymer/QDs sandwiched nanodisks
   on a wafer scale with high rationality and reproducibility. Via
   template-assisted assembling of QDs, the plasmonic Au nanodisk can be
   precisely coupled to a defined number of QD clusters. Using steady-state
   and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we studied the
   enhancement of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) rate between
   donor and acceptor QDs coupled with plasmonic resonance of the Au
   nanodisk. By systematically inereasing the,spectral overlap of the
   acceptor QD emission with plasmonic resonance, we demonstrated that the
   donor lifetime decreases, monotonically and FRET rate increases
   significantly,. The results suggest a viable route to fabricate
   precisely controlled plasinonic-QD coupled nanoentities and to enhance
   energy transfer at the nanoscale.}},

Abstract = {{Using end-member permeabilities defined by a worldwide compilation of
   sediment permeabilities at convergent margins, we compare permeability
   predictions using a geometric mean and a two-component effective medium
   theory (EMT). Our implementation of EMT includes a threshold fraction of
   the high-permeability component that determines whether flow occurs
   dominantly in the high- or low-permeability component. We find that this
   threshold fraction in most cases is equal to the silt+sand-sized
   fraction of the sediment. This suggests that sediments undergoing
   primary consolidation tend to exhibit flow equally distributed between
   the high- and low-permeability components. We show that the EMT method
   predicts permeability better than the weighted geometric mean of the
   end-member values for clay fractions <0.6. This work provides insight
   into the microstructural controls on permeability in subducting
   sediments and valuable guidance for locations which lack site-specific
   permeability results but have available grain-size information.}},

Title = {{Joint haplotype assembly and genotype calling via sequential Monte Carlo
   algorithm}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genetic variations predispose individuals to hereditary
   diseases, play important role in the development of complex diseases,
   and impact drug metabolism. The full information about the DNA
   variations in the genome of an individual is given by haplotypes, the
   ordered lists of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on
   chromosomes. Affordable high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies
   enable routine acquisition of data needed for the assembly of single
   individual haplotypes. However, state-of-the-art high-throughput
   sequencing platforms generate data that is erroneous, which induces
   uncertainty in the SNP and genotype calling procedures and, ultimately,
   adversely affect the accuracy of haplotyping. When inferring haplotype
   phase information, the vast majority of the existing techniques for
   haplotype assembly assume that the genotype information is correct. This
   motivates the development of methods capable of joint genotype calling
   and haplotype assembly.
   Results: We present a haplotype assembly algorithm, ParticleHap, that
   relies on a probabilistic description of the sequencing data to jointly
   infer genotypes and assemble the most likely haplotypes. Our method
   employs a deterministic sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that associates
   single nucleotide polymorphisms with haplotypes by exhaustively
   exploring all possible extensions of the partial haplotypes. The
   algorithm relies on genotype likelihoods rather than on often
   erroneously called genotypes, thus ensuring a more accurate assembly of
   the haplotypes. Results on both the 1000 Genomes Project experimental
   data as well as simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed
   approach enables highly accurate solutions to the haplotype assembly
   problem while being computationally efficient and scalable, generally
   outperforming existing methods in terms of both accuracy and speed.
   Conclusions: The developed probabilistic framework and sequential Monte
   Carlo algorithm enable joint haplotype assembly and genotyping in a
   computationally efficient manner. Our results demonstrate fast and
   highly accurate haplotype assembly aided by the re-examination of
   erroneously called genotypes.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{We prove that balanced loss-gain distributions provide an elegant path
   towards realizing loss-free unidirectional cloaks for objects much
   larger than the wavelength. By coating a scatterer with an ultrathin
   metasurface with balanced loss and gain, such as a parity-time
   (PT)-symmetric metasurface in the special case of a symmetric scatterer,
   we show that it is possible to ideally cloak the scatterer from a
   particular direction. The passive portion of the cloak ensures that the
   incident power on the illuminated side of the object is fully absorbed,
   while the active portion radiates the required pattern on the opposite
   side, automatically synchronized with the impinging signal, eliminating
   shadows and making the object invisible. The proposed approach
   substitutes complex metamaterial cloaks and achieves cloaking with
   relaxed limitations on size, and in an ultrathin, loss-free, and stable
   design. Beyond introducing a new venue to cloaking of large objects, our
   paper shows the unique potential for scattering manipulation introduced
   by structures with balanced loss and gain, pointing to a new direction
   in the field of PT-symmetric systems.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{162-165}},

Abstract = {{Polymer films with halohydrocarbon solvents as additive solvents were
   fabricated to investigate the solvent effect on dielectric performance.
   Bromobenzene, chlorobenzene (CB), chloroform, and fluorobenzene (FB)
   were used as halohydrocarbon solvents. The cyanoethyl pullulan (CRS)
   polymer film with CB had a dielectric constant of 21.5 with a dielectric
   loss of 0.017 at 100 Hz, which exhibited a 37\% increase in dielectric
   constant compared to the neat CRS polymer film. Increment of the
   dielectric constant is attributed to the high polarizability of carbon
   chlorine bonds originated from CB absorbed in CRS. For the case of the
   CRS polymer film with FB, the dielectric constant did not increase due
   to the low polarizability of carbon fluorine bonds. In order to verify
   the dielectric performance of the CRS polymer film with CB (CRS/CB),
   AC-driven inorganic powder electroluminescent (EL) device was fabricated
   using the green emission ZnS:Cu,CL phosphor particles. An EL device with
   CRS/CB polymer film as a dielectric layer exhibited a 37\% and 55\%
   increase in luminance and efficiency, respectively compared to that with
   neat CRS polymer. This increase in EL performance was attributed to the
   increase of charge carrier density at the interface between the emitting
   and dielectric layers, resulting in the increased possibility of the
   charge carrier tunneling into phosphor particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   enhanced electrochemical performance is mainly due to the presence of
   the well-mixed TiC + C matrix that plays an important role in providing
   high conductivity as well as mechanical buffer that mitigates the huge

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained increasing attention with
   regard to photovoltaic devices, because of their low cost and simple
   fabrication methods; they are mostly investigated in indoor
   light-harvesting and portable applications. The focus has been on three
   main parameters of photovoltaic devices, that is, lifetime, and cost
   effectiveness. A DSSC consists of four prominent components including a
   photoanode, a photosensitizer, a redox electrolyte, and a counter
   electrode. The counter electrode is a crucial component, in which
   triiodide is reduced to iodide by electrons flowing through the external
   circuit. An effective approach to improve the performance of a counter
   electrode is to enhance the power conversion efficiency and to reduce
   the cost of the device. Platinum-coated conducting glass electrodes give
   the best performance, but their high cost and the scarcity of platinum
   restricts large-scale application in DSSCs. This has prompted
   researchers to develop low-costing platinum-free electrodes for DSSCs.
   In this review, we focus mainly on counter electrode materials for the
   electrocatalytic redox reaction for the I-/I-3(-) electrolyte, and apart
   from this, other counter electrode materials for iodine-free redox
   electrolytes are discussed. Different counter electrode materials are
   highlighted in different categories such as carbon materials, conducting
   polymers, oxide and sulfide materials, transition-metal nitrides and
   carbides, and composite materials. The stability of counter electrodes
   in DSSCs is also presented.}},

Title = {{Transport of water in a transient impact-generated lunar atmosphere}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{255}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{148-158}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, several missions have detected signs of water and
   other volatiles in cold, permanently shadowed craters near the lunar
   poles. Observations suggest that some of these volatiles could have been
   delivered by comet impacts and therefore, understanding the impact
   delivery mechanism becomes key to explaining the origin and distribution
   of lunar water. During impact, the constituent ices of a comet nucleus
   vaporize; a significant part of this vapor remains gravitationally bound
   to the Moon, transforming the tenuous, collisionless lunar exosphere
   into a collisionally thick, transient atmosphere. Here, we use numerical
   simulations to investigate the physical processes governing volatile
   transport in the transient atmosphere generated after a comet impact,
   with a focus on how these processes influence the accumulation of water
   in polar cold traps. It is observed that the transient atmosphere
   maintains a certain characteristic structure for at least several Earth
   days after impact, during which time volatile transport occurs primarily
   through low-altitude winds that sweep over the lunar day-side.
   Meanwhile, reconvergence of vapor antipodal to the point of impact
   results in preferential redistribution of water in the vicinity of the
   antipode. Due to the quantity of vapor that remains gravitationally
   bound, the atmosphere is sufficiently dense that lower layers are
   shielded from photodestruction, prolonging the lifetime of water
   molecules and allowing greater amounts of water to reach cold traps.
   Short-term ice deposition patterns are markedly non-uniform and the
   variations that arise in simulated volatile abundance between different
   cold traps could potentially explain variations that have been observed
   through remote sensing. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{4538-4545}},

Abstract = {{The Marangoni effect causes liquids to flow toward localized regions of
   higher surface tension. In a thin film, such flow results in smooth
   thickness variations and may represent a practically useful route to
   manufacture topo graphically patterned surfaces. An especially versatile
   material for this application should be able to be spatially programmed
   to possess regions of higher or lower relative surface tension so that
   the direction of flow into or out of those areas could be directed with
   precision. To this end, we describe here a photopolymer whose melt-state
   surface tension can be selectively raised or lowered in the light
   exposed regions depending on the wavelength and dose of applied light.
   The direction of Marangoni flow into or out of the irradiated areas
   agreed with expected surface tension changes for photochemical
   transformations characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques
   and chromatographic experiments. The maximum film thickness variations
   achieved in this work are over 200 nm, which developed after only 5 mm
   of thermal annealing. Both types of flow patterns can even be programmed
   sequentially into the same film and developed in a single thermal
   annealing step, which to our knowledge represents the first example of
   harnessing photochemical stimuli to bidirectionally control flow.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have recently received great attention as a
   potential complement to existing lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology.
   Because of the difference between Na and Li in nature, what has been an
   attractive anode material for LIBs may or may not be utilized for NIBs.
   Using density functional theory calculations, we examine and compare the
   sodiation behaviors of Si, Ge, and Sn, in comparison also to their
   lithiation processes if needed. We evaluate single Na incorporation in
   the host matrices (M = Si, Ge, Sn) and also discuss the formation of Na
   M alloys in terms of structural evolution and energetics, along with
   their mechanical and diffusion properties. While the alloy systems
   considered in this work appear to undergo similar transformation during
   sodiation and lithiation, the M networks tend to lose connectivity more
   rapidly in the former. At Na/Li:M = 1:1 ratio, the M networks in a-NaM
   alloys already disintegrate into compact isolated clusters while those
   in a-LiM still maintain extended connectivity via puckered conformation.
   This unique difference in their specific atomic arrangements contributes
   to the more rapid softening, larger volume expansion, and faster
   increase in Na diffusivity with sodiation in comparison to the case of
   lithiation.}},

Abstract = {{We use density functional theory to examine structure-activity
   relationships of small vanadia clusters supported on anatase TiO2(001)
   and rutile TiO2(110) surfaces. A thermodynamic analysis indicates that
   the vanadia monomer cluster can be stabilized on the anatase TiO2(001)
   surface in a catalytically relevant oxygen environment. On the other
   hand, vanadia clusters tend to aggregate into dimers on the rutile
   TiO2(110) surface because this surface binds the monomer less strongly
   as compared to anatase. Hydrogen adsorption is found to be exothermic on
   the vanadia monomer adsorbed on both supports, enhanced by a charge
   transfer between the adsorbate and the substrate. There is no such
   charge transfer on vanadia dimers and tetramers, where the hydrogen
   adsorption energies are similar to that on the single crystal V2O5(001)
   surface. The improved catalytic performance of the anatase support can
   be attributed to the ability of this surface to stabilize the
   catalytically active vanadia monomer clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has a large and well-documented
   global burden of disease. Our analysis uses high-resolution (10 km,
   global-coverage) concentration data and cause-specific integrated
   exposure-response (IER) functions developed for the Global Burden of
   Disease 2010 to assess how regional and global improvements in ambient
   air quality could reduce attributable mortality from PM2.5. Overall, an
   aggressive global program of PM2.5 mitigation in line with WHO interim
   guidelines could avoid 750 000 (23\%) of the 3.2 million deaths per year
   currently (ca. 2010) attributable to ambient PM2.5. Modest improvements
   in PM2.5 in relatively clean regions (North America, Europe) would
   result in surprisingly large avoided mortality, owing to demographic
   factors and the nonlinear concentration-response relationship that
   describes the risk of particulate matter in relation to several
   important causes of death. In contrast, major improvements in air
   quality would be required to substantially reduce mortality from PM2.5
   in more polluted regions, such as China and India. Moreover, forecasted
   demographic and epidemiological transitions in India and China imply
   that to keep PM2.5-attributable mortality rates (deaths per 100 000
   people per year) constant, average PM2.5 levels would need to decline by
   similar to 20-30\% over the next 15 years merely to offset increases in
   PM2.5-attributable mortality from aging populations. An effective
   program to deliver clean air to the world's most polluted regions could
   avoid several hundred thousand premature deaths each year.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{We develop a fully stochastic theory for coagulation and fragmentation
   (CF) in a finite system with a maximum cluster size constraint. The
   process is modeled using a high-dimensional master equation for the
   probabilities of cluster configurations. For certain realizations of
   total mass and maximum cluster sizes, we find exact analytical results
   for the expected equilibrium cluster distributions. If coagulation is
   fast relative to fragmentation and if the total system mass is
   indivisible by the mass of the largest allowed cluster, we find a mean
   cluster-size distribution that is strikingly broader than that predicted
   by the corresponding mass-action equations. Combinations of total mass
   and maximum cluster size under which equilibration is accelerated,
   eluding late-stage coarsening, are also delineated. Finally, we compute
   the mean time it takes particles to first assemble into a maximum-sized
   cluster. Through careful state-space enumeration, the scaling of mean
   assembly times is derived for all combinations of total mass and maximum
   cluster size. We find that CF accelerates assembly relative to monomer
   kinetic only in special cases. All of our results hold in the infinite
   system limit and can be only derived from a high-dimensional discrete
   stochastic model, highlighting how classical mass-action models of
   self-assembly can fail. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{United polarizable multipole water model for molecular mechanics
   simulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{We report the development of a united AMOEBA (uAMOEBA) polarizable water
   model, which is computationally 3-5 times more efficient than the
   three-site AMOEBA03 model in molecular dynamics simulations while
   providing comparable accuracy for gas-phase and liquid properties. In
   this coarse-grained polarizable water model, both electrostatic
   (permanent and induced) and van der Waals representations have been
   reduced to a single site located at the oxygen atom. The permanent
   charge distribution is described via the molecular dipole and quadrupole
   moments and the many-body polarization via an isotropic molecular
   polarizability, all located at the oxygen center. Similarly, a single
   van der Waals interaction site is used for each water molecule. Hydrogen
   atoms are retained only for the purpose of defining local frames for the
   molecular multipole moments and intramolecular vibrational modes. The
   parameters have been derived based on a combination of ab initio quantum
   mechanical and experimental data set containing gas-phase cluster
   structures and energies, and liquid thermodynamic properties. For
   validation, additional properties including dimer interaction energy,
   liquid structures, self-diffusion coefficient, and shear viscosity have
   been evaluated. The results demonstrate good transferability from the
   gas to the liquid phase over a wide range of temperatures, and from
   nonpolar to polar environments, due to the presence of molecular
   polarizability. The water coordination, hydrogen-bonding structure, and
   dynamic properties given by uAMOEBA are similar to those derived from
   the all-atom AMOEBA03 model and experiments. Thus, the current model is
   an accurate and efficient alternative for modeling water. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Macroscopic traffic flow models have been widely used to provide
   reliable prediction inputs for active transportation and demand
   management (ATDM). The representative models include METANET, FREFLOW,
   and KRONOS. In recent development of ATDM, METANET-based prediction
   models have started to more attention with their convenience of
   formulating several important macroscopic control variables, such as
   speed limit and ramp flow. However, applying METANET models on
   real-world observations (e.g., loop detector data) may experience
   significant performance issues, especially when applied to a corridor
   with heterogeneous links. Heterogeneous links refer to adjacent links
   that have different macroscopic traffic flow characteristics such as
   free flow speed and capacity. The heterogeneity is usually caused by
   changes in road geometry and environment, which commonly exist in urban
   freeway networks. This article provides an in-depth study to investigate
   the error mechanism of this problem and proposes several effective
   methods to improve the performance of METANET model over heterogeneous
   links. It is found in this article that applying some dynamic
   formulations to the convention term of the speed equation in METANET can
   significantly reduce the impact of link heterogeneity issue. The
   proposed method was evaluated using field loop detector data collected
   at I-894 corridor in Milwaukee, WI.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible loads, i.e. the loads whose power trajectory is not bound to a
   specific one, constitute a sizable portion of current and future
   electric demand. This flexibility can be used to improve the performance
   of the grid, should the right incentives be in place. In this paper, we
   consider the optimal decision making problem faced by a flexible load,
   demanding a certain amount of energy over its availability period,
   subject to rate constraints. The load is also capable of providing
   ancillary services (AS) by decreasing or increasing its consumption in
   response to signals from the independent system operator (ISO). Under
   arbitrarily distributed and correlated Markovian energy and AS prices,
   we obtain the optimal policy for minimising expected total cost, which
   includes cost of energy and benefits from AS provision, assuming no
   capacity reservation requirement for AS provision. We also prove that
   the optimal policy has a multi-threshold form and can be computed,
   stored and operated efficiently. We further study the effectiveness of
   our proposed optimal policy and its impact on the grid. We show that,
   while optimal simultaneous consumption and AS provision under real-time
   stochastic prices are achievable with acceptable computational burden,
   the impact of adopting such real-time pricing schemes on the network
   might not be as good as suggested by the majority of the existing
   literature. In fact, we show that such price responsive loads are likely
   to induce peak-to-average ratios much more than what is observed in the
   current distribution networks and adversely affect the grid.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the assembly of body centered-cubic (bcc)
   superlattices of organic ligand-coated nanocrystals. First, examples of
   bcc superlattices of dodecanethiol-capped Au nanocrystals and oleic
   acid-capped PbS and PbSe nanocrystals are presented and examined by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence small-angle
   X-ray scattering (GISAXS). These superlattices tend to orient on their
   densest (110) superlattice planes and exhibit a significant amount of
   \{112\} twinning. The same nanocrystals deposit as monolayers with
   hexagonal packing, and these thin films can coexist with thicker bcc
   superlattice layers, even though there is no hexagonal plane in a bcc
   lattice. Both the preference of bcc in bulk films over the denser
   face-centered cubic (fcc) superlattice structure and the transition to
   hexagonal monolayers can be rationalized in terms of packing frustration
   of the ligands. A model is presented to calculate the difference in
   entropy associated with capping ligand packing frustration in bcc and

Abstract = {{A theoretical and experimental study of the electrocatalytic oxidation
   of CO on PdxAu140-x@Pt dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticle (DEN)
   catalysts is presented. These nanoparticles are comprised of a core
   having an average of 140 atoms and a Pt monolayer shell. The CO
   oxidation activity trend exhibits an unusual koppa shape as the number
   of Pd atoms in the core is varied from 0 to 140. Calculations based on
   density functional theory suggest that the koppa-shaped trend is driven
   primarily by structural changes that affect the CO binding energy on the
   surface. Specifically, a pure Au core leads to deformation of the Pt
   shell and a compression of the Pt lattice. In contrast, Pd, from the
   pure Pd cores, tends to segregate on the DEN surface, forming an
   inverted configuration having Pt within the core and Pd in the shell.
   With a small addition of Au, however, the alloy PdAu cores stabilize the
   core@shell structures by preventing Au and Pd from escaping to the
   particle surface.}},

Abstract = {{NiV2O6 films were successfully fabricated and characterized as
   photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. The films
   were synthesized by vacuum codeposition of Ni and V followed by
   annealing in air. The resulting triclinic NiV2O6 films were n-type
   semiconductors with optical transitions at similar to 2.1 eV (indirect)
   and 2.4 eV (direct). Photo-electrochemical testing in 1 M KOH showed a
   photoelectrochemical band gap of similar to 2.4 eV and that similar to
   45\% of the photocurrent came from light with lambda > 420 nm. NiV2O6
   electrodes showed quite stable photo current under bias in basic
   electrolyte, indicative of chemical stability against photocorrosion
   despite its relatively small band gap. The flat band potential of NiV2O6
   was similar to 0.6 V vs RHE, thus allowing photogenerated holes to
   oxidize water thermodynamically, and confirmed by oxygen evolution
   measurements (Faradaic efficiency similar to 80\%). Suitable oxygen
   evolution catalysts and n-type doping are suggested to improve the PEC
   performance of this material further. Regarding the search for
   inexpensive photoanodes capable of harvesting photons in the visible
   region of the solar spectrum, the availability of Ni and V makes NiV2O6
   a promising anode material for photoelectrochemical use.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the behavioral aspects of the individual decision-making
   process is important in identifying and addressing barriers in the
   adoption of residential solar photovoltaic (PV). However, there is
   little systematic research focusing on these aspects of residential PV
   in Texas, an important, large, populous state, with a range of
   challenges in the electricity sector including increasing demand,
   shrinking reserve margins, constrained water supply, and challenging
   emissions reduction targets under proposed federal regulations. This
   paper aims to address this gap through an empirical investigation of a
   new survey-based dataset collected in Texas on solar energy perceptions
   and behavior. The results of this analysis offer insights into the
   perceptions and motivations influencing intentions and behavior toward
   solar energy in a relatively untapped market and help identify
   information gaps that could be targeted to alleviate key barriers to
   adopting solar, thereby enabling significant emissions reductions in the

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simulation study of the energy and CO2 benefits of
   a transparent, near-infrared switching electrochromic (NEC) glazing for
   building applications. NEC glazings are an emerging dynamic window
   technology that can modulate the transmission of NIR heat without
   affecting transmission of visible light. In this study, a hypothetical
   NEC glazing is simulated on clear and tinted glass in six building type
   models in 16 U.S. climate regions using Energy Plus 7.1. The total
   annual energy consumption for lighting, heating, cooling, and
   ventilation for the NEC glazings are compared with high performance
   static windows and conventional tungsten-oxide EC glazings. Using
   regional CO2 intensities and building stock totals, the results from
   individual building model simulations are scaled up to national totals.
   The U.S. national savings from NEC deployment is found to be 167 TWh/yr
   (600 PJ/yr) compared to the existing building stock, but only 8 TWh/yr
   (29 PJ/yr) or 1.56 million tonnes of CO2 per year when compared to high
   performance static glazings with lighting controls installed.
   NEC performance varied significantly by building type and location. This
   analysis reveals that 50\% of the total energy savings can be realized
   by deploying NEC glazings in only 18\% of the total window stock, and
   75\% of the savings in only 39\% of the stock. The best performing
   locations include medium offices and midrise residential buildings in
   northern climates, where energy savings per unit window area range from
   50 to 200 kWh/m(2)-yr. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   phthalates content; one with high contents of diisononyl phthalate
   (DINP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was selected for emissions
   testing in a small chamber at two different temperatures. Using the same
   type of vinyl flooring, large-scale chamber experiments were then
   conducted in three testing phases. In the first phase, the gas-phase
   concentrations of DINP and DEHP in the large chamber at 36 degrees C
   were about three times lower than those in the small chamber under the
   same temperature, which is consistent with its lower area/volume ratio.
   In the second phase, when a large air mixing fan inside the chamber was
   replaced with a small fan, the gas-phase concentrations of DINP and DEHP
   in the large chamber were reduced slightly, due to the decease of mass
   transfer coefficient and emission rate. During the last phase, when the
   temperature of the chamber was reduced to 25 degrees C, phthalate
   concentrations dropped instantly and steeply due to the significantly
   reduced emissions. However, they did not decrease as quickly thereafter
   because of desorption of phthalates from the internal surfaces of the
   large chamber. A fundamental mechanistic model was developed to
   interpret the experimental results in the large chamber based on the
   emission characteristics obtained in the small chamber measurements.
   Reasonable agreement was obtained between the model calculation and
   experimental data. Further model simulations show that temperature and
   air mixing above the source material have important effects on the fate
   of phthalates, while the impact of air change rate (ACH) is not
   significant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Lumen endothelialization of bioengineered vascular scaffolds
   is essential to maintain small-diameter graft patency and prevent
   thrombosis postimplantation. Unfortunately, nondestructive imaging
   methods to visualize this dynamic process are lacking, thus slowing
   development and clinical translation of these potential
   tissue-engineering approaches. To meet this need, a fluorescence imaging
   system utilizing a commercial optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   catheter was designed to visualize graft endothelialization. Methods: C7
   DragonFly intravascular OCT catheter was used as a channel for delivery
   and collection of excitation and emission spectra. Poly-dl-lactide
   (PDLLA) electrospun scaffolds were seeded with endothelial cells (ECs).
   Seeded cells were exposed to Calcein AM before imaging, causing the
   living cells to emit green fluorescence in response to blue laser. By
   positioning the catheter tip precisely over a specimen using
   high-fidelity electromechanical components, small regions of the
   specimen were excited selectively. The resulting fluorescence
   intensities were mapped on a two-dimensional digital grid to generate
   spatial distribution of fluorophores at single-cell-level resolution.
   Fluorescence imaging of endothelialization on glass and PDLLA scaffolds
   was performed using the OCT catheter-based imaging system as well as
   with a commercial fluorescence microscope. Cell coverage area was
   calculated for both image sets for quantitative comparison of imaging
   techniques. Tubular PDLLA scaffolds were maintained in a bioreactor on
   seeding with ECs, and endothelialization was monitored over 5 days using
   the OCT catheter-based imaging system. Results: No significant
   difference was observed in images obtained using our imaging system to
   those acquired with the fluorescence microscope. Cell area coverage
   calculated using the images yielded similar values. Nondestructive
   imaging of endothelialization on tubular scaffolds showed cell
   proliferation with cell coverage area increasing from 154\% to 89 +/-
   6\% over 5 days. Conclusion: In this study, we showed the capability of
   an OCT catheter-based imaging system to obtain single-cell resolution
   and to quantify endothelialization in tubular electrospun scaffolds. We
   also compared the resulting images with traditional microscopy, showing
   high fidelity in image capability. This imaging system, used in
   conjunction with OCT, could potentially be a powerful tool for in vitro
   optimization of scaffold cellularization, ensuring long-term graft
   patency postimplantation.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an experimental approach to simultaneously measure the
   stress dependence of ultrasonic wave velocities at 1 MHz, and therefore
   the components of the undrained elastic stiffness tensor, as well as the
   components of the complex conductivity tensor in the frequency range
   from 100 mHz to 10 Hz. We performed the experiments on a cylindrical
   core sample from the Haynesville Formation (porosity of approximately
   0.08, bound water excluded, and clay content, mostly illite,
   approximately 30-40 wt\%). We performed experiments under controlled
   confining and pore fluid pressures, achieving differential pressure
   states representative of autochthonous reservoir conditions. Directional
   measurements were made using independent acquisition arrays
   (piezoelectric crystals and nonpolarizing electrodes) distributed
   azimuthally on the core sample external surface, the bedding plane being
   along the axis of the cylindrical core sample. Ultrasonic waveforms were
   recorded on a high-resolution oscilloscope, and complex impedance
   spectra were recorded with a four-electrode acquisition system using an
   impedance meter with precision of 0.1 mrad. Experiments were repeated
   under drained and undrained conditions, over loading and unloading
   sequences for fully water-saturated conditions. Measurements show strong
   stress dependence on ultrasonic and complex conductivity measurements,
   which can be ascribed to the opening and closing of cracks within the
   samples. The data were used to estimate the anisotropic electrical and
   elastic effective pressure coefficients of the core sample, resulting in
   effective stress coefficients smaller than one for both elastic and
   electrical properties. These effective stress coefficients were also
   smaller for the electrical and acoustic properties once the cracks have
   closed. The anisotropy ratio for the components of the complex
   conductivity tensor was on the order of 30, whereas it was only 2 for
   the compressional components of the stiffness tensor (C-11/C-33)}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic properties of solid waste are needed to reliably evaluate the
   seismic response of landfills. A testing method for investigating the
   dynamic properties of solid waste in situ has been implemented at
   various landfills. The field method is primarily aimed at evaluating
   shear wave and compression wave velocities at small strains as well as
   the shear modulus reduction versus shearing strain relationship of solid
   waste. In this study, shear modulus nonlinearity was successfully
   evaluated for shearing strains ranging from 10(-4) to 0.2 \%. The
   relationship between shear modulus and shearing strain was investigated
   by applying dynamic horizontal loads applied by a mobile field shaker at
   the waste surface in a staged-loading sequence. The solid waste response
   was measured with a buried array of three-component geophones. The
   testing method also permitted in situ assessment of the effect of
   confining stress and waste variability on the dynamic properties of
   solid waste. Load-settlement measurements and in situ unit weight
   measurements were also made. Testing equipment, field setup, testing
   procedure, data analysis, and examples of test results are presented.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICRO-NANOLITHOGRAPHY MEMS AND MOEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recently, directed self-assembly (DSA) has emerged as a promising
   lithography solution for cut manufacturing. We perform a comprehensive
   study on the DSA aware mask optimization problem to provide a DSA
   friendly design on cut layers. We first formulate the problem as an
   integer linear programming (ILP) to assign cuts to different guiding
   templates, targeting both conflict minimization and line-end extension
   minimization. As ILP may not be scalable for very large size problems,
   we then propose two speed-up strategies. The first one is to decompose
   the initial problem into smaller ones and solve them separately,
   followed by solution merging without much loss of quality. The second
   one is using the set cover algorithm to decide the DSA guiding pattern
   assignment, and then legalize the template placement. Our approaches can
   be naturally extended to handle arbitrary DSA guiding template patterns
   with complicated shapes. Experimental results show that our
   methodologies can significantly improve the DSA friendly, i.e., both the
   unresolved pattern number and the line-end extensions can be reduced.

Abstract = {{A fundamental principle of measurement and analysis is that methods must
   be self-consistent. For example, if a soil's gas diffusion properties
   were precisely known, then measuring gas diffusion in that soil should
   yield the known result. We tested the self-consistency of a standard
   protocol for analyzing gas diffusion measurements and found that it has
   a tendency to introduce artifacts. We examined the impacts of four
   assumptions: the presence or absence of a gradient in air-filled
   porosity epsilon across the sample, the kind of average used to give the
   effective diffusivity D(epsilon)/D-0 across the sample, the physical
   presence of a gas fraction threshold epsilon(t) > 0 for transport, and
   the inclusion of such a threshold in the model fitted to the data. We
   examined the effects of correcting the gradient artifact and using
   different models in analyzing two published data sets. If the soil has a
   non-negligible epsilon(t) > 0, but the model fitted to the data is of
   the form D(epsilon) = A epsilon(N) (forcing epsilon(t) = 0), then the
   fitted exponent N will artifactually increase with increasingly narrow
   pore size distributions. This artifact of forcing epsilon(t) = 0 calls
   into question models that prescribe higher N in coarser soils.}},

Volume = {{202}},

Abstract = {{We discuss an inverse source formulation aimed at focusing wave energy
   produced by ground surface sources to target subsurface poroelastic
   formations. The intent of the focusing is to facilitate or enhance the
   mobility of oil entrapped within the target formation. The underlying
   forward wave propagation problem is cast in two spatial dimensions for a
   heterogeneous poroelastic target embedded within a heterogeneous elastic
   semi-infinite host. The semi-infiniteness of the elastic host is
   simulated by augmenting the (finite) computational domain with a buffer
   of perfectly matched layers. The inverse source algorithm is based on a
   systematic framework of partial-differential-equation-constrained
   optimization. It is demonstrated, via numerical experiments, that the
   algorithm is capable of converging to the spatial and temporal
   characteristics of surface loads that maximize energy delivery to the
   target formation. Consequently, the methodology is well-suited for
   designing field implementations that could meet a desired oil mobility
   threshold. Even though the methodology, and the results presented herein
   are in two dimensions, extensions to three dimensions are
   straightforward.}},

Title = {{Scaling of geochemical reaction rates via advective solute transport}},
Journal = {{CHAOS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Transport in porous media is quite complex, and still yields occasional
   surprises. In geological porous media, the rate at which chemical
   reactions (e.g., weathering and dissolution) occur is found to diminish
   by orders of magnitude with increasing time or distance. The temporal
   rates of laboratory experiments and field observations differ, and
   extrapolating from laboratory experiments (in months) to field rates (in
   millions of years) can lead to order-of-magnitude errors. The reactions
   are transport-limited, but characterizing them using standard solute
   transport expressions can yield results in agreement with experiment
   only if spurious assumptions and parameters are introduced. We
   previously developed a theory of non-reactive solute transport based on
   applying critical path analysis to the cluster statistics of
   percolation. The fractal structure of the clusters can be used to
   generate solute distributions in both time and space. Solute velocities
   calculated from the temporal evolution of that distribution have the
   same time dependence as reaction-rate scaling in a wide range of field
   studies and laboratory experiments, covering some 10 decades in time.
   The present theory thus both explains a wide range of experiments, and
   also predicts changes in the scaling behavior in individual systems with
   increasing time and/or length scales. No other theory captures these
   variations in scaling by invoking a single physical mechanism. Because
   the successfully predicted chemical reactions include known results for
   silicate weathering rates, our theory provides a framework for
   understanding changes in the global carbon cycle, including its effects
   on extinctions, climate change, soil production, and denudation rates.
   It further provides a basis for understanding the fundamental time
   scales of hydrology and shallow geochemistry, as well as the basis of
   industrial agriculture. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Intrinsically disordered proteins drive membrane curvature}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Assembly of highly curved membrane structures is essential to cellular
   physiology. The prevailing view has been that proteins with
   curvature-promoting structural motifs, such as wedge-like amphipathic
   helices and crescent-shaped BAR domains, are required for bending
   membranes. Here we report that intrinsically disordered domains of the
   endocytic adaptor proteins, Epsin1 and AP180 are highly potent drivers
   of membrane curvature. This result is unexpected since intrinsically
   disordered domains lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure.
   However, in vitro measurements of membrane curvature and protein
   diffusivity demonstrate that the large hydrodynamic radii of these
   domains generate steric pressure that drives membrane bending. When
   disordered adaptor domains are expressed as transmembrane cargo in
   mammalian cells, they are excluded from clathrin-coated pits. We propose
   that a balance of steric pressure on the two surfaces of the membrane
   drives this exclusion. These results provide quantitative evidence for
   the influence of steric pressure on the content and assembly of curved
   cellular membrane structures.}},

Title = {{Deep and high-resolution three-dimensional tracking of single particles

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Molecular trafficking within cells, tissues and engineered
   three-dimensional multicellular models is critical to the understanding
   of the development and treatment of various diseases including cancer.
   However, current tracking methods are either confined to two dimensions
   or limited to an interrogation depth of similar to 15 mu m. Here we
   present a three-dimensional tracking method capable of quantifying rapid
   molecular transport dynamics in highly scattering environments at depths
   up to 200 mu m. The system has a response time of 1ms with a temporal
   resolution down to 50 mu s in high signal-to-noise conditions, and a
   spatial localization precision as good as 35 nm. Built on
   spatiotemporally multiplexed two-photon excitation, this approach
   requires only one detector for three-dimensional particle tracking and
   allows for two-photon, multicolour imaging. Here we demonstrate
   three-dimensional tracking of epidermal growth factor receptor complexes
   at a depth of similar to 100 mu m in tumour spheroids.}},

Abstract = {{A direct numerical simulation of incompressible channel flow at a

   large outer layer structures and small inner-layer structures. At
   intermediate distances from the wall, the one-dimensional spectrum of
   the streamwise velocity fluctuation in both the streamwise and spanwise
   directions exhibits k(-1) dependence over a short range in wavenumber

   Study Design: This study entails laboratory animal research.
   Methods: Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were synchronized to a 12:12
   light/dark schedule. Each group receiving the antibiotic (100 mg/kg
   gentamicin sulfate) at a different circadian time. Auditory brainstem
   response was obtained at pretreatment and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks.
   Results: At all measured frequencies, hearing losses were significantly
   (P<.001) greater when gentamicin was administered during the diurnal
   rest span than the nighttime activity span. At 4 weeks, the average
   total hearing loss, quantified by elevation of threshold values over the
   tested auditory frequencies, was 31.3 and 25.6 dB for the 2 hours after
   lights on (HALO) and 8 HALO groups, respectively. The loss progressed at
   6 weeks to 42.5 (2 HALO) and 37.5 (8 HALO) dB. At 6 weeks, the 14 and 20
   HALO groups had losses of 17.5 and 26.3 dB, respectively. Trough serum
   gentamicin concentration significantly (P<.01) increased during
   treatment, being the highest at 4 weeks. Urine urea nitrogen 24-hour
   levels of the 2 and 8 HALO groups differed significantly (P<.01) from
   the 14 and 20 HALO groups.
   Conclusions: Ototoxicity was greater when gentamicin was administered
   during their diurnal rest than during nocturnal activity. A dosing
   paradigm may be used to deliver a lower therapeutic antimicrobial
   concentration during the nighttime rest period when the studied adverse
   effects are of highest risk.}},

Abstract = {{We report here a facile synthetic approach for preparing water-soluble
   Fe3O4 nanoparticle (NP) clusters with tunable size distribution and
   magnetic properties. The primary NP sizes were controlled by tuning the
   nucleation and growth rates with temperature and ligand concentration

   interparticle interactions. We have investigated the size control of
   clusters as well as individual primary NPs via dynamic light scattering
   (DLS) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was used to measure
   the magnetic properties of Fe3O4 NP for determining the effect of size
   distribution at room temperature. These water dispersible NP clusters
   can be utilized in various biomedical applications. In this study, we
   demonstrated the application of synthesized nanoclusters to enhance
   imaging contrast a novel ultrasound-based imaging modality, pulsed

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic promoters, especially minimally sized, are critical for
   advancing fungal synthetic biology. Fungal promoters often span hundreds
   of base pairs, nearly ten times the amount of bacterial counterparts.
   This size limits large-scale synthetic biology efforts in yeasts. Here
   we address this shortcoming by establishing a methodical workflow
   necessary to identify robust minimal core elements that can be linked
   with minimal upstream activating sequences to develop short, yet strong
   yeast promoters. Through a series of library-based synthesis, analysis
   and robustness tests, we create a set of non-homologous, purely
   synthetic, minimal promoters for yeast. These promoters are comprised of
   short core elements that are generic and interoperable and 10 bp UAS
   elements that impart strong, constitutive function. Through this
   methodology, we are able to generate the shortest fungal promoters to
   date, which can achieve high levels of both inducible and constitutive
   expression with up to an 80\% reduction in size.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulphur batteries with a high theoretical energy density are
   regarded as promising energy storage devices for electric vehicles and
   large-scale electricity storage. However, the low active material
   utilization, low sulphur loading and poor cycling stability restrict
   their practical applications. Herein, we present an effective strategy
   to obtain Li/polysulphide batteries with high-energy density and
   long-cyclic life using three-dimensional nitrogen/sulphur codoped
   graphene sponge electrodes. The nitrogen/sulphur codoped graphene sponge
   electrode provides enough space for a high sulphur loading, facilitates
   fast charge transfer and better immobilization of polysulphide ions. The
   hetero-doped nitrogen/sulphur sites are demonstrated to show strong
   binding energy and be capable of anchoring polysulphides based on
   first-principles calculations. As a result, a high specific capacity of
   1,200 mAhg(-1) at 0.2C rate, a high-rate capacity of 430 mAhg(-1) at 2C
   rate and excellent cycling stability for 500 cycles with similar to

Abstract = {{Terminators play an important role both in completing the transcription
   process and impacting mRNA half-life. As such, terminators are an
   important synthetic component considered in applications such as
   heterologous gene expression and metabolic engineering. Here, we
   describe a panel of short (35-70 bp) synthetic terminators that can be
   used for modulating gene expression in yeast. The best of these
   synthetic terminator resulted in 3.7-fold more fluorescent protein
   output and 4.4-fold increase in transcript level compared to that with
   the commonly used CYC1 terminator. These synthetic terminators offer
   several advantages over native sequences, including an easily
   synthesized short length, minimal sequence homology to native sequences,
   and similar or better performance characteristics than those of commonly
   used longer terminators. Furthermore, the synthetic terminators are
   highly functional in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an alternative
   yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica, demonstrating that these synthetic designs
   are transferrable between diverse yeast species.}},

Abstract = {{A linear beamformer design for the broadcast channel where the base
   station is equipped with Nt antennas and signals to M = 2 users (each
   with a single antenna) and where the vector channels are spatially
   correlated is considered. This problem is of relevance in wireless
   standardization efforts where two users are simultaneously scheduled
   (instead of the theoretically feasible Nt user scheduling) to minimize
   signaling overhead. The users are assumed to have perfect channel state
   information (CSI), whereas the base station has statistical information
   of the channels. In the first part of this work, the role of the
   relevance of feedback is studied via the quantification of the gap in
   ergodic sum-rate between the perfect CSI and statistics-only extremes.
   In this direction, the importance of orthogonality of the dominant
   eigenmodes of the two users in maximizing the gap is established. In the
   second part of this work, in scenarios with a large gap, limited
   feedback beamforming codebooks and a codeword selection metric are
   designed for the low-rate feedback setting. The main contribution here
   is the proposal of a generalized eigenvector codebook and feedback of
   the codeword index that maximizes an estimate of the
   signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) of each user. Extensions
   of this scheme are also proposed for the general N-t antenna case withM
   users, whereM <= N-t. It is shown via numerical studies that this scheme
   leads to significant performance improvement across a large family of
   channels over schemes such as Grassmannian/ Random Vector
   Quantization/single-user codebooks with the channel projection metric
   for codeword selection.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by biological swarms occurring in nature, there is recent
   interest in developing swarms comprised completely of engineered agents.
   The main challenge for developing swarm guidance laws compared to
   earlier formation flying and multi-vehicle coordination approaches is
   the sheer number of agents involved. While formation flying applications
   might involve up to 10 to 20 agents, swarms are desired to contain
   hundreds to many thousands of agents. In order to deal with the sheer
   size, the present paper makes a break with past deterministic methods,
   and considers the swarm as a statistical ensemble for which guidance can
   be performed from a probabilistic point of view. The probability-based
   approach takes advantage of the law of large numbers, and leads to
   computationally tractable and implementable swarm guidance laws. Agents
   following a probabilistic guidance algorithm make statistically
   independent probabilistic decisions based solely on their own state,
   which ultimately guides the swarm to the desired density distribution in
   the configuration space. Two different synthesis methods are introduced
   for designing probabilistic guidance laws. The first is based on the
   Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm, and the second is based on using
   linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The M-H approach ensures convergent
   swarm behavior subject to enforced desired motion constraints, while the
   LMI approach additionally ensures exponential convergence with a
   prescribed decay rate, and allows minimization of a cost function that
   reflects fuel expenditure. In addition, both algorithms endow the swarm
   with the property of self-repair, and the capability to strictly enforce
   zero-probability keep-out regions. This last property requires a slight
   generalization of the Perron-Frobenius theory, and can be very useful in
   swarm applications that contain regions where no agents are allowed to
   go. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the methods and
   demonstrate desired properties of the guided swarm.}},

   significant role in planewave DFT calculations. This function is often

   readily generate a class of ``preconditioning{''} functions. These
   functions have higher order approximation accuracy and fulfill the two

Abstract = {{To reduce Schottky-barrier-induced contact and access resistance, and
   the impact of charged impurity and phonon scattering on mobility in
   devices based on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
   considerable effort has been put into exploring various doping
   techniques and dielectric engineering using high-kappa oxides,
   respectively. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a high-kappa
   dielectric that serves as an effective n-type charge transfer dopant on
   monolayer (ML) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Utilizing amorphous titanium
   suboxide (ATO) as the ``high-kappa dopant{''}, we achieved a contact
   resistance of similar to 480 Omega.mu m that is the lowest reported
   value for ML MoS2. An ON current as high as 240 mu A/mu m and field
   effect mobility as high as 83 cm(2)/V-s were realized using this doping
   technique. Moreover, intrinsic mobility as high as 102 cm(2)/V-s at 300
   K and 501 cm(2)/V-s at 77 K were achieved after ATO encapsulation that
   are among the highest mobility values reported on ML MoS2. We also
   analyzed the doping effect of ATO films on ML MoS2, a phenomenon that is
   absent when stoichiometric TiO2 is used, using ab initio density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations that shows excellent agreement with
   our experimental findings. On the basis of the
   interfacial-oxygen-vacancy mediated doping as seen in the case of
   high-kappa ATO ML MoS2, we propose a mechanism for the mobility
   enhancement effect observed in TMD-based devices after encapsulation in
   a high-kappa dielectric environment.}},

   realistic bilayer cloaks covering a finite-length conductive rod for
   multiband and wideband operation, offering a >5-dB (70\%) scattering
   suppression over bandwidths that exceed any passive mantle cloak
   demonstrated so far by over nine times. Finally, we apply the same

   suppression is maintained, despite the change in geometry and increased

Pages = {{2588-2608}},

Abstract = {{Speckle contrast imaging enables rapid mapping of relative blood flow
   distributions using camera detection of back-scattered laser light.
   However, speckle derived flow measures deviate from direct measurements
   of erythrocyte speeds by 47 +/- 15\% (n = 13 mice) in vessels of various
   calibers. Alternatively, deviations with estimates of volumetric flux
   are on average 91 +/- 43\%. We highlight and attempt to alleviate this
   discrepancy by accounting for the effects of multiple dynamic scattering
   with speckle imaging of microfluidic channels of varying sizes and then
   with red blood cell (RBC) tracking correlated speckle imaging of
   vascular flows in the cerebral cortex. By revisiting the governing
   dynamic light scattering models, we test the ability to predict the
   degree of multiple dynamic scattering across vessels in order to correct
   for the observed discrepancies between relative RBC speeds and
   multi-exposure speckle imaging estimates of inverse correlation times.
   The analysis reveals that traditional speckle contrast imagery of
   vascular flows is neither a measure of volumetric flux nor particle
   speed, but rather the product of speed and vessel diameter. The
   corrected speckle estimates of the relative RBC speeds have an average
   10 +/- 3\% deviation in vivo with those obtained from RBC tracking.

   polyaniline-poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid)
   (PANI-PAAMPSA) was employed for the first time to fabricate
   high-efficiency symmetrical supercapacitors. PANI-PAAMPSA was
   synthesized by the templating method, and subsequently directly
   processed from water to form flexible supercapacitors with 2 M H2SO4
   electrolyte. The capacitive properties of PANI-PAAMPSA-based
   supercapacitors were further enhanced by incorporating ZnO nanowires
   into PANI-PAAMPSA electrodes. The all-solution-based supercapacitors
   with PANI-PAAMPSA/ZnO nanowires exhibited significant capacitance
   improvements of up to 3-fold increase compared to PANI-PAAMPSA
   electrodes. The enhanced capacitive characteristics of PANI-PAAMPSA/ZnO
   nanowires are attributed to the larger surface area and pseudo
   capacitance due to the nanowires. Our work thus could provide a simple
   and scalable route to fabricate solution-based and low-cost
   electrochemical energy storage devices such as supercapacitors or

Abstract = {{Although segmented voltage-mode R - 2R digital-to-analog converters
   (DACs) have been widely used for high-precision DACs in static
   applications, its code-dependent reference current induces a
   code-dependent IR drop through the reference and ground wires, imposing
   a limitation on the linearity performance. To alleviate this problem,
   this brief proposes a simple way to compute the reference current and
   compensate it via a low-resolution auxiliary DAC controlled by a
   computational block. A (4+12)-bit segmented voltage-mode R - 2R DAC with
   the proposed technique is designed and simulated in a 0.6-mu m CMOS
   process. The SPICE simulation shows a six-time reduction of the integral
   nonlinearity error from the code-dependent reference current, greatly
   relaxing the requirement on the reference and ground distribution paths
   design. Compared with the conventional way of adding high-quality
   reference and ground buffers on chip, the proposed technique is
   estimated to take up 1/3 area and consume 1/5 power. With the scaling of
   the technology, the proposed technique becomes more competent, for 60\%
   area comes from the purely digital computational block. Furthermore, for
   multichannel R - 2R DACs, the computational block can be shared among
   channels if time multiplexing is allowed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential for wind power plants (WPPs) to
   damp interarea modes. Interarea modes may be the result of a single or a
   group of generators oscillating against another group of generators
   across a weak transmission link. If poorly damped, these power system
   oscillations can cause system instability and potentially lead to
   blackouts. Power conversion devices, particularly, megawatt-scale
   converters that connect wind turbines and photovoltaic power plants to
   the grid, could be used to damp these oscillations by injecting power
   into the system out of phase with the potentially unstable mode. In our
   model, this power may be provided by a WPP. Over time, the net energy
   injection is near zero; therefore, providing this ``static damping{''}
   capability is not expected to affect the energy production of a WPP.
   This is a measurement-based investigation that employs simulated
   measurement data. It is not a traditional small-signal stability
   analysis based on Eigenvalues and knowledge of the power system network
   and its components. Kundur's well-known two-area, four-generator system
   and a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based WPP are modeled in
   PSCAD/EMTDC. The WPP model is based on the Western Electricity
   Coordination Council (WECC) standard model. A controller to damp
   interarea oscillations is added to the WECC DFIG model, and its effects
   are studied. Analysis is performed on the data generated by the
   simulations. The sampling frequency is set to resemble the sampling
   frequency at which data are available from phasor measurement units in
   the real world. The Yule-Walker algorithm is used to estimate the power
   spectral density of these signals.}},

Abstract = {{Co-extruded films with up to 65 layers of two rheologically mismatched
   polymer systems - polystyrene/poly(methylmethacrylate) (PS/PMMA) and
   hard/soft thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) - were successfully
   produced using a combination of a 9-layer feedblock, low-pressure drop
   multiplier dies, and external lubricants. Formation of viscoelastic
   instabilities was studied using a custom visualization and by finite
   element method (FEM) simulations of a standard multiplier. The results
   showed that the flow inside the standard multiplier die is highly
   non-uniform, with severe gradients in shear and normal stresses and
   viscous encapsulation occurring mainly in the initial multiplication
   stages where there is enough material available in the low-viscosity
   layers to proceed with the encapsulation. To mitigate layer degradation
   the standard 2- or 3-layer feedblock was replaced with a 9-layer one,
   thereby decreasing the thickness of each layer at the end of the
   feedblock. Also, subsequent layering was performed using a low flow
   resistance die. This new multiplier die yields a more uniform flow
   profile and imparts a more homogeneous thermo-mechanical history on the
   melt which results in an improved layer stability. Simulations showed
   that in the standard die the second normal-stress difference (N-2)
   responsible for elastic instabilities at the edges of the die are very
   high. These can be reduced by inducing slip at the wall resulting in be
   much improved layer uniformity and stability. This was accomplished
   experimentally via the use of external lubricants, and the resulting
   layered structure was indeed much better than was possible to achieve
   with the conventional multiplier dies.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a potentially disruptive yet
   beneficial change to our transportation system. This new technology has
   the potential to impact vehicle safety, congestion, and travel behavior.
   All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel
   time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to
   approach \$2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly
   \$4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to
   implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will
   likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are
   being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may
   lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain
   undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards,
   a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The
   impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation
   system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address
   these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these
   areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs,
   determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data
   privacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Congestion pricing schemes have been traditionally derived based on
   analytical representations of travel demand and traffic flows, such as
   in bottleneck models. A major limitation of these models, especially
   when applied to urban networks, is the inconsistency with traffic
   dynamics and related phenomena such as hysteresis and the capacity drop.
   In this study we propose a new method to derive time-varying tolling
   schemes using the concept of the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD). The
   adopted method is based on marginal cost pricing, while it also enables
   to account realistically for the dynamics of large and heterogeneous
   traffic networks. We derive two alternative cordon tolls using
   network-aggregated traffic flow conditions: a step toll that neglects
   the spatial distribution of traffic by simply associating the marginal
   costs of any decrease in production within the NFD to the surplus of
   traffic; and a step toll that explicitly accounts for how network
   performance is also influenced by the spatial variance in a 3D-NFD. This
   pricing framework is implemented in the agent-based simulation model
   MATSim and applied to a case study of the city of Zurich. The tolling
   schemes are compared with a uniform toll, and they highlight how the
   inhomogeneous distribution of traffic may compromise the effectiveness
   of cordon tolls. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Manual radio frequency (RF) ablation to restore a normal cardiac rhythm
   requires significant skill, manual dexterity and experience. In response
   to this, ablation methods and technologies have evolved rapidly in the
   past decade, including the development of remote navigation
   technologies. Today, two principal methods of remote navigation are
   available. One utilizes magnetic field vectors to navigate proprietary
   catheters, the other maneuvers standard catheters robotically. The main
   advantages of remote navigation include improved catheter stability,
   reduced fluoroscopy times and decreased total radiation exposure to both
   the patient and the operator. The main limitations include cost and
   longer procedure times. Remote magnetic navigation appears to have the
   best safety profile; however, its efficacy in creating lesions may be
   lower, which has been attributed to the soft-tip catheter used. Remote
   robotic navigation on the other hand, which uses regular catheter tips,
   is associated with a slightly higher overall complication rate, but

Abstract = {{A gate-normal-tunneling field-effect transistor (gate-normal TFET) with
   abrupt switching and increased tunneling current is a promising
   candidate for low-voltage operation in advanced technology nodes.
   However, it is still challenging to experimentally achieve steep
   subthreshold swings (SSs) of theoretical predictions. The parasitic
   nonnormal tunneling initiated prior to the desired normal tunneling due
   to poor electrostatic control is considered to be one of the
   explanations for the experimentally inferior SS. This paper investigates
   the electrostatic control of gate-normal TFETs via numerical simulations
   in which a semiclassical approximation is used for the tunneling barrier
   imposed by quantum confinement. The electrostatic potential throughout
   the device is found to be strongly influenced by quantum effects. As a
   result, we predicted a higher parasitic tunneling current using our
   semiclassical simulations (quantum corrected 3-D) compared with
   classical (nonquantum corrected 3-D) results for gate-normal TFETs with
   a homojunction. This finding was supported by a qualitative fully
   quantummechanical (2-D sub-band) study. A heterojunction gate-normal
   TFET design utilizing an underlying modulation-doping layer is proposed
   to minimize parasitic tunneling with small variation of quantum
   confinement and low doping level in the channel.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution system reliability, defined by the expected frequency and
   duration of load service interruptions caused by component failures, is
   shown to be dependent on the topology of the distribution network, as
   well as on the relative placement of loads and generators within the
   system. In a shipboard electrical distribution system, a network
   topology based on the breaker-and-a-half scheme is shown to confer
   greater reliability than equivalent distribution topologies based on the
   ring bus and double bus, double breaker designs. The overall service
   interruption rate in the breaker-and-a-half topology is 17.8\% less than
   that in the ring bus topology and 40.0\% less than that in the double
   bus, double breaker topology. Further, an optimized equipment placement
   configuration is algorithmically identified for the loads and generators
   within the breaker-and-a-half distribution network, further increasing
   reliability. The optimal equipment placement decreases the overall
   system interruption rate by 0.54\%. The paper also determines an optimal
   location for additional in-feeds that should be connected to the ship's
   most critical loads so that maximum benefits to service reliability are
   obtained.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Emerging sensing technologies offer a solution to improve jobsite safety
   performance by providing location information to determine a worker's
   safety situation regarding proximity to dangers. However, due to the
   imperfections inherent in real-world sensor data, the collected location
   data might be imperfect (missing, uncertain, erroneous, and
   inconsistent). Among those types of imperfection, error is one of the
   most common. In many cases, jobsite safety monitoring applications are
   built on the assumption that the collected location data represent the
   exact situation, which might not be true due to erroneous data. However,
   data errors and their potential impacts on the decisions in autonomous
   jobsite safety monitoring systems have not been substantially studied.
   This paper describes an autonomous jobsite safety monitoring testbed
   developed to collect data from location-aware sensors. The authors
   developed six jobsite crane-safety monitoring test scenarios to
   replicate the construction activities on a full-scale jobsite and used
   the collected data, as well as simulated sensor data at various error
   levels, to quantify the impacts on decision-making performance in terms
   of precision and recall of workers' dangerous situations. The results
   indicated that the worst performance appears near the transition area of
   different risk levels (red to yellow/yellow to green) and the
   performance degrades significantly after the standard deviation of the
   localization errors reaches 2 cm in the testbed, corresponding to 2 m in
   a jobsite. The study provides researchers with an understanding of how
   much data errors impact safety monitoring system performance and guide
   future research directions. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Title = {{Information-Integration Maturity Model for the Capital Projects Industry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an information integration maturity model for the
   capital projects industry. Due to the trends of construction projects
   becoming more globalized and their processes being conducted more
   concurrently, information integration has been widely implemented in the
   capital projects industry. However, one issue for the planning of
   information integration is that the current practice tends to be ad hoc
   and centered on individual information integration opportunities. Also,
   the existing knowledge for information integration implementation is not
   helpful because different organizations have different idiosyncratic
   characteristics regarding work processes, culture, and information
   technology (IT) use. To address these issues, a research team consisting
   of 15 members from leading contractors, construction clients, and
   academia in the United States developed a capital projects information
   integration maturity model. The model can be used to assess the current
   state of work functions in terms of information integration. It can also
   be used to manage a portfolio of information integration opportunities
   that can help organizations make a systematic plan for further
   investment in information integration. The model has been applied to
   various real-world information integration cases. The application
   broadly validates the concept and utility of the model, showing it to be
   a useful and accurate characterization of information integration
   performance within the capital projects industry.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past century, hydrogels have emerged as effective materials for
   an immense variety of applications. The unique network structure of
   hydrogels enables very high levels of hydrophilicity and
   biocompatibility, while at the same time exhibiting the soft physical
   properties associated with living tissue, making them ideal
   biomaterials. Stimulus-responsive hydrogels have been especially
   impactful, allowing for unprecedented levels of control over material
   properties in response to external cues. This enhanced control has
   enabled groundbreaking advances in healthcare, allowing for more
   effective treatment of a vast array of diseases and improved approaches
   for tissue engineering and wound healing. In this extensive review, we
   identify and discuss the multitude of response modalities that have been
   developed, including temperature, pH, chemical, light, electro, and
   shear-sensitive hydrogels. We discuss the theoretical analysis of
   hydrogel properties and the mechanisms used to create these responses,
   highlighting both the pioneering and most recent work in all of these
   fields. Finally, we review the many current and proposed applications of
   these hydrogels in medicine and industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{89-96}},

Abstract = {{Permeable friction course (PFC), a porous hot-mix asphalt, is typically
   applied to improve wet weather safety on high-speed roadways in Texas.
   In order to warrant expensive PFC construction, a statistical evaluation
   of its safety benefits is essential. Generally, the literature on the
   effectiveness of porous mixes in reducing wet-weather crashes is limited
   and often inconclusive. In this study, the safety effectiveness of PFC
   was evaluated using a fully Bayesian before after safety analysis.
   First, two groups of road segments overlaid with PFC and non-PFC
   material were identified across Texas; the non-PFC or reference road
   segments selected were similar to their PFC counterparts in terms of
   site specific features. Second, a negative binomial data generating
   process was assumed to model the underlying distribution of crash counts
   of PFC and reference road segments to perform Bayesian inference on the
   safety effectiveness. A data-augmentation based computationally
   efficient algorithm was employed for a fully Bayesian estimation. The
   statistical analysis shows that PFC is not effective in reducing wet
   weather crashes. It should be noted that the findings of this study are
   in agreement with the existing literature, although these studies were
   not based on a fully Bayesian statistical analysis. Our study suggests
   that the safety effectiveness of PFC road surfaces, or any other safety
   infrastructure, largely relies on its interrelationship with the road
   user. The results suggest that the safety infrastructure must be
   properly used to reap the benefits of the substantial investments. (C)

   transmitter equipped with multiple antennas sends multiple streams via
   spatial multiplexing to a large number of geographically separated
   single antenna receive nodes. This approach is applicable to scenarios
   such as those enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) which holds much
   commercial potential and could facilitate distributed multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) communication in future systems. The receive
   nodes quantize their received signals and forward the quantized received
   signals to a receive fusion center. With global channel knowledge and
   forwarded quantized information from the receive nodes, the fusion
   center attempts to decode the transmitted symbols. We assume the
   transmit vector consists of arbitrary constellation points, and each
   receive node quantizes its received signal with one bit for each of the
   real and imaginary parts of the signal to minimize the transmission
   overhead between the receive nodes and the fusion center. Fusing this
   data is a nontrivial problem because the receive nodes cannot decode the
   transmitted symbols before quantization. We develop an optimal maximum
   likelihood (ML) receiver and a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-type
   receiver at the fusion center. Despite its suboptimality, the ZF-type
   receiver is simple to implement and shows comparable performance with
   the ML receiver in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime but
   experiences an error rate floor at high SNR. It is shown that this error
   floor can be overcome by increasing the number of receive nodes.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{7, SI}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a coupled experimental and numerical method is utilized
   for characterizing the elastic-plastic constitutive properties of
   ductile materials. Three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) is
   used to measure the full field deformation on two mutually orthogonal
   surfaces of a uniaxial tensile test specimen. The material's
   constitutive model, whose parameters are unknown a priori, is determined
   through an optimization process that compares these experimental
   measurements with finite element simulations in which the constitutive
   model is implemented. The optimization procedure utilizes the robust
   dataset of locally observed deformation measurements from DIC in
   addition to the standard measurements of boundary load and displacement
   data. When the difference between the experiment and simulations is
   reduced sufficiently, a set of parameters is found for the material
   model that is suitable to large strain levels. This method of material
   characterization is applied to a tensile specimen fabricated from a
   sheet of 15-5 PH stainless steel. This method proves to be a powerful
   tool for calibration of material models. The final parameters produce a
   simulation that tracks the local experimental displacement field to
   within a couple percent of error. Simultaneously, the percent error in
   the simulation for the load carried by the specimen throughout the test
   is less than 1\%. Additionally, half of the parameters for Hill's yield
   criterion, describing anisotropy of the normal stresses, are found from
   a single tensile test. This method will find even greater utility in
   calibrating more complex material models by greatly reducing the
   experimental effort required to identify the appropriate model
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Successful cellular cardiomyoplasty is dependent on biocompatible
   materials that can retain the cells in the myocardium in order to
   promote host tissue repair following myocardial infarction. A variety of
   methods have been explored for incorporating a cell-seeded matrix into
   the heart, the most popular options being direct application of an
   injectable system or surgical implantation of a patch. Fibrin-based gels
   are suitable for either of these approaches, as they are biocompatible
   and have mechanical properties that can be tailored by adjusting the
   initial fibrinogen concentration. We have previously demonstrated that
   conjugating amine-reactive homo-bifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   to the fibrinogen prior to crosslinking with thrombin can increase
   stability both in vivo and in vitro. Similarly, when mesenchymal stem
   cells are combined with PEGylated fibrin and injected into the
   myocardium, cell retention can be significantly increased and scar
   tissue reduced following myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that
   this gel system could similarly promote cardiomyocyte viability and
   function in vitro, and that optimizing the mechanical properties of the
   hydrogel would enhance contractility. In this study, we cultured HL-1
   cardiomyocytes either on top of plated PEGylated fibrin (2D) or embedded
   in 3D gels and evaluated cardiomyocyte function by assessing the
   expression of cardiomyocyte specific markers, sarcomeric -actin, and
   connexin 43, as well as contractile activity. We observed that the
   culture method can drastically affect the functional phenotype of HL-1
   cardiomyocytes, and we present data suggesting the potential use of
   PEGylated fibrin gel layers to prepare a sheet-like construct for
   myocardial regeneration. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112: 1446-1456. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new method termed Truncated Hierarchical
   Catmull-Clark Subdivision (THCCS), which generalizes truncated
   hierarchical B-splines to control grids of arbitrary topology. THCCS
   basis functions satisfy partition of unity, are linearly independent,
   and are locally refinable. THCCS also preserves geometry during adaptive
   h-refinement and thus inherits the surface continuity of Catmull-Clark
   subdivision, namely C-2-continuous everywhere except at the local region
   surrounding extraordinary nodes, where the surface continuity is C-1.
   Adaptive isogeometric analysis is performed with THCCS basis functions
   on a benchmark problem with extraordinary nodes. Local refinement on
   complex surfaces is also studied to show potential wide application of
   the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   difference between the experimental data and the simulated data, is
   proportional to the measurement time and the number of receivers.
   Consequently, the posterior distribution of the parameters, in a
   Bayesian setting, concentrates around the ``true{''} parameters, and we
   can employ Laplace approximation and speed up the estimation of the
   expected Kullback-Leibler divergence (expected information gain), the
   optimality criterion in the experimental design procedure. Since the
   source parameters span several magnitudes, we use a scaling matrix for
   efficient control of the condition number of the original Hessian
   matrix. We use a second-order accurate finite difference method to
   compute the Hessian matrix and either sparse quadrature or Monte Carlo
   sampling to carry out numerical integration. We demonstrate the
   efficiency, accuracy, and applicability of our method on a
   two-dimensional seismic source inversion problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We study a reformulated version of Reissner-Mindlin plate theory in
   which rotation variables are eliminated in favor of transverse shear
   strains. Upon discretization, this theory has the advantage that the
   ``shear locking{''} phenomenon is completely precluded, independent of
   the basis functions used for displacement and shear strains. Any
   combination works, but due to the appearance of second derivatives in
   the strain energy expression, smooth basis functions are required. These
   are provided by Isogeometric Analysis, in particular, NURBS of various
   degrees and quadratic triangular NURPS. We present a mathematical
   analysis of the formulation proving convergence and error estimates for
   all physically interesting quantities, and provide numerical results
   that corroborate the theory.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystals are promising structures, but they are too large for
   achieving maximum energy storage performance. We show that rescaling
   3-nm particles through lithiation followed by delithiation leads to
   high-performance energy storage by realizing high capacitance close to
   the theoretical capacitance available via ion-to-atom redox reactions.
   Reactive force-field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations support the
   conclusion that Li atoms react with nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiO-n) to
   form lithiated core-shell structures (Ni:Li2O), whereas subsequent
   delithiation causes Ni:Li2O to form atomic clusters of NiO-a. This is
   consistent with in situ X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopy
   results showing that Ni2+ of the nanocrystal changes during
   lithiation-delithiation through Ni-0 and back to Ni2+. These processes
   are also demonstrated to provide a generic route to rescale another
   metal oxide. Furthermore, assembling NiO-a into the positive electrode
   of an asymmetric device enables extraction of full capacitance for a
   counter negative electrode, giving high energy density in addition to
   robust capacitance retention over 100,000 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Few methods exist that can accurately handle dynamic light scattering in
   the regime between single and highly multiple scattering. We demonstrate
   dynamic light scattering Monte Carlo (DLS-MC), a numerical method by
   which the electric field autocorrelation function may be calculated for
   arbitrary geometries if the optical properties and particle motion are
   known or assumed. DLS-MC requires no assumptions regarding the number of
   scattering events, the final form of the autocorrelation function, or
   the degree of correlation between scattering events. Furthermore, the
   method is capable of rapidly determining the effect of particle motion
   changes on the autocorrelation function in heterogeneous samples. We
   experimentally validated the method and demonstrated that the
   simulations match both the expected form and the experimental results.
   We also demonstrate the perturbation capabilities of the method by
   calculating the autocorrelation function of flow in a representation of
   mouse microvasculature and determining the sensitivity to flow changes
   as a function of depth. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Many control-oriented models represent the entire fuel cell stack's
   thermal response with a single lumped temperature. While this
   simplification greatly reduces the computational expense of these
   models, it does not afford any information regarding cell-to-cell
   differences. In many cases, the operating conditions in the outermost
   (inlet and outlet) cells are significantly different from the rest of
   the stack. As a result, these cells also often limit the stack
   performance. Previous experiments performed by the authors have shown
   this phenomenon, particularly in the inlet cells. Poor performance in
   these cells led to a gradual decline in the stack average voltage at
   high loads, and caused the inaccuracy of the lumped fuel cell model
   prediction. These results suggest a need for individual modeling of the
   end cells to properly model performance in these areas, particularly
   during high demand phases.
   In this paper, the necessity of multiple thermal control volumes (CVs)
   in the cathode channel is investigated to address the spatial gradients.
   A method to improve the thermal modeling accuracy near the cathode inlet
   of the fuel cell stack by using un-evenly spaced CVs to represent the
   channel is presented. Analysis is performed starting with the 1D heat
   transfer equation for the cathode channel. By using scaling arguments to
   remove extraneous terms, a simplified 1D solution for the temperature
   profile in the cathode channel is developed. From this result, the
   necessary CV sizes to remain within a critical band of the actual
   spatial temperature profile can be calculated. Copyright (c) 2015,

Abstract = {{We apply the Feynman-Kleinert Quasi-Classical Wigner (FK-QCW) method
   developed in our previous work {[}Smith et al., J. Chem. Phys. 142,
   244112 (2015)] for the determination of the dynamic structure factor of
   liquid para-hydrogen and ortho-deuterium at state points of (T = 20.0 K,
   n = 21.24 nm(-3)) and (T = 23.0 K, n = 24.61 nm(-3)), respectively. When
   applied to this challenging system, it is shown that this new FK-QCW
   method consistently reproduces the experimental dynamic structure factor
   reported by Smith et al. {[}J. Chem. Phys. 140, 034501 (2014)] for all
   momentum transfers considered. This shows that FK-QCW provides a
   substantial improvement over the Feynman-Kleinert linearized
   path-integral method, in which purely classical dynamics are used.
   Furthermore, for small momentum transfers, it is shown that FK-QCW
   provides nearly the same results as ring-polymer molecular dynamics
   (RPMD), thus suggesting that FK-QCW provides a potentially more
   appealing algorithm than RPMD since it is not formally limited to
   correlation functions involving linear operators. (C) 2015 AIP

Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{We develop two classes of quasi-classical dynamics that are shown to
   conserve the initial quantum ensemble when used in combination with the
   Feynman-Kleinert approximation of the density operator. These dynamics
   are used to improve the Feynman-Kleinert implementation of the classical
   Wigner approximation for the evaluation of quantum time correlation
   functions known as Feynman-Kleinert linearized path-integral. As shown,
   both classes of dynamics are able to recover the exact classical and
   high temperature limits of the quantum time correlation function, while
   a subset is able to recover the exact harmonic limit. A comparison of
   the approximate quantum time correlation functions obtained from both
   classes of dynamics is made with the exact results for the challenging
   model problems of the quartic and double-well potentials. It is found
   that these dynamics provide a great improvement over the classical
   Wigner approximation, in which purely classical dynamics are used. In a
   special case, our first method becomes identical to centroid molecular
   dynamics. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the ionization of a P dopant in a Si(111) nanofilm using
   first-principles electronic structure calculations with 2D periodic
   boundary conditions. The electrostatic divergence of a charged periodic
   system is resolved by defining an electrostatic reference potential
   along the confined direction. After ionization, there is an overall
   electrostatic potential drop of the system. A nanofilm with larger
   periodicity can reduce the potential drop by screening the P ion, and
   leads to a smaller ionization energy. We compare the ionization energy
   calculated for the P-doped Si nanofilm with a P-doped Si nanocrystal and
   a P-doped Si(110) nanowire. As dimensionality decreases, quantum
   confinement tends to lower the ionization energy by raising the defect
   level. However, lower dimensionality also reduces screening after P
   ionization. This leads to a larger electrostatic potential drop and
   offsets the effect of quantum confinement on the ionization energy.}},

Abstract = {{The directed self-assembly (DSA) of two sub-20 nm pitch:
   silicon-containing block copolymers (BCPs) was accomplished using, a
   double patterned sidewall scheme-in which each lithographic prepatterned
   feature produced two regions for pattern registration. In doing so, the
   critical dimension of the lithographic prepatterns was:relaxed by a
   factor of 2 compared to previously reported schemes for DSA. The key to
   enabling the double-patterned sidewall scheme is the exploitation of the
   oxidized sidewalls of cross-linked polystyrene formed, during the
   pattern transfer of the resist via reactive kin etching. This results in
   shallow trenches with two guiding interfaces per prepatterned feature.
   Electron loss spectroscopy was used to study and confirm the guiding
   mechanism of the double-patterned,sidewalls, and pattern transfer of the
   BCPs into a silicon substrate was achieved using reactive ion etching.
   The line edge roughness, width roughness, and placement error are near
   the target required for bit-patterned media applications, and the
   technique is also compatible with the needs of the semiconductor
   industry for high-volume manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{The smaller physical dimensions of microchannel reactors result in
   substantial reductions in capital and operating cost. However,
   microreactor control is challenging because of the difficulty of
   implementing distributed measurement devices and actuators. Using an
   autothermal catalytic plate reactor coupling steam-methane reforming and
   methane combustion as a test case, we propose a novel temperature
   control method using bimetallic strips that function as thermally
   actuated valves to regulate fluid flow in the microchannels. Bimetallic
   strips convert temperature variations into mechanical displacement, and
   by proper placement in the reactor channels, they can function as valves
   that close and open with temperature changes. We discuss the necessary
   design decisions and show through simulations that the thermally
   actuated valves contribute to an inherently safer design of microchannel
   reactors. We demonstrate that they can compensate for unequal flow
   distribution to the microchannels and successfully reject disturbances
   that would otherwise result in hotspots that could damage the reactor
   structure.}},

   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared

   surface via covalent Si-S bonds. The thiol-capping layer, however,
   readily undergoes hydrolysis and severe degradation in the presence of

Abstract = {{Dodecanethiol-capped gold (Au) nanocrystal superlattices can undergo a
   surprisingly diverse series of ordered structure transitions when heated
   (Goodfellow, B. W.; Rasch, M. R; Hessel, C. M.; Patel, R. N.; Smilgies,
   D.-M.; Korgel, B. A. Nano Lett. 2013, 13, 5710-5714). These are the
   result of highly uniform changes in nanocrystal size, which subsequently
   force a spontaneous rearrangement of superlattice structure. Here, we
   show that halide-containing surfactants play an essential role in these
   transitions. In the absence of any halide-containing surfactant,
   superlattices of dodecanethiol-capped (1.9-nm-diameter) Au nanocrystals
   do not change size until reaching about 190-205 degrees C, at which
   point the gold cores coalesce. In the presence of halide-containing
   surfactant, such as tetraoctylphosphonium bromide (TOPB) or
   tetraoctylammounium bromide (TOAB), the nanocrystals ripen at much lower
   temperature and superlattices undergo various ordered structure
   transitions upon heating. Chloride- and iodide-containing surfactants
   induce similar behavior, destabilizing the Au thiol bond and reducing
   the thermal stability of the nanocrystals.}},

Title = {{Accelerometer-based physical activity levels among Mexican adults and

   cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: The objectives of this study were to describe the
   accelerometer based total and bout-specific PA levels for a
   representative sample of adults from Cuernavaca, Mexico, and to examine
   the relationships with sociodemographic characteristics and BMI status.
   Methods: Cross sectional study of adults from Cuernavaca, Mexico (2011,
   n = 677). Participants wore Actigraph GT3X accelerometers for seven days
   and sociodemographic data was collected through a survey. Weight and
   height were objectively measured. Total minutes/week of
   moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and of MVPA occurring within bouts of at
   least ten minutes were obtained. Intensity-specific (moderate and
   vigorous) total PA and bouted-PA was also obtained. The relation of each
   PA variable with sex, age, socioeconomic status, education, marital
   status and BMI status was assessed using unadjusted and adjusted linear
   models.
   Results: The mean total MVPA among adults from Cuernavaca was 221.3 +/-
   10.0 (median = 178.3 min/week). Average MVPA within bouts was 65.8 +/-
   4.7 min/week (median = 30.0 min/week). 9.7 \% of total MVPA occurred
   within bouts. Significant associations were found for total and
   bout-specific MVPA with being male (positive) and owning a motor vehicle
   (negative). Additional associations were found for intensity-specific PA
   outcomes. Mexican adults were more active during weekdays than weekends,
   suggesting that PA may be more strongly driven by necessity (transport)
   than by choice (leisure).
   Conclusions: This is the first study to objectively measure PA for a
   representative sample of Mexican adults in an urban setting. The
   sociodemographic correlates vary from those known from high income
   countries, stressing the need for more correlate studies from
   lower-to-middle income countries.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature responsive hydrogels based on ionic polymers exhibit
   swelling transitions in aqueous solutions as a function of shifting pH
   and ionic strength, in addition to temperature. Applying these hydrogels
   to useful applications, particularly for biomedical purposes such as
   drug delivery and regenerative medicine, is critically dependent on
   understanding the hydrogel solution responses as a function of all three
   parameters together. In this work, interpenetrating polymer network
   (IPN) hydrogels of polyacrylamide and poly(acrylic acid) were formulated
   over a broad range of synthesis variables using a fractional factorial
   design, and were examined for equilibrium temperature responsive
   swelling in a variety of solution conditions. Due to the acidic nature
   of these IPN hydrogels, usable upper critical solution temperature
   (UCST) responses for this system occur in mildly acidic environments.
   Responses were characterized in terms of maximum equilibrium swelling
   and temperature-triggered swelling using turbidity and gravimetric
   measurements. Additionally, synthesis parameters critical to achieving
   optimal overall swelling, temperature-triggered swelling, and sigmoidal
   temperature transitions for this IPN system were analyzed based on the
   fractional factorial design used to formulate these hydrogels. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Two optimized cathode configurations (a porous current collector and an

   introduced for assessing, respectively, the polysulfide retention and
   the electrochemical reactivity of the cell. The analysis results in line
   with the expected materials chemistry principles suggest that the
   interlayer configuration offers stable cell performance for sulfur
   cathodes. The significance of the interlayer is to block the free
   migration of the dissolved polysulfides, which is a key factor for
   immobilizing and continuously utilizing the active material in sulfur
   cathodes. Accordingly, the carbon mat interlayers provide sulfur
   cathodes with a high discharge capacity of 864 mA h g(-1) at 1 C rate
   with a high capacity retention rate of 61\% after 400 cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Many organisms spanning from bacteria to mammals orient to the earth's
   magnetic field. For a few animals, central neurons responsive to
   earth-strength magnetic fields have been identified; however,
   magnetosensory neurons have yet to be identified in any animal. We show
   that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans orients to the earth's magnetic
   field during vertical burrowing migrations. Well-fed worms migrated up,
   while starved worms migrated down. Populations isolated from around the
   world, migrated at angles to the magnetic vector that would optimize
   vertical translation in their native soil, with northern-and
   southern-hemisphere worms displaying opposite migratory preferences.
   Magnetic orientation and vertical migrations required the TAX-4 cyclic
   nucleotide-gated ion channel in the AFD sensory neuron pair. Calcium
   imaging showed that these neurons respond to magnetic fields even
   without synaptic input. C. elegans may have adapted magnetic orientation
   to simplify their vertical burrowing migration by reducing the
   orientation task from three dimensions to one.}},

   conditioning systems in Austin, Texas}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of a model for evaluating peak load
   reduction and change in overall energy consumption for a residential air
   conditioning (AC) compressor with and without condenser-side thermal
   storage. Stored rainwater (or any other type of on-site water storage)
   could be utilized as a heat sink for the condenser during peak hours,
   allowing for more efficient and lower power compressor operation, then
   re-chilled at night during off-peak hours. The system evaluated in this
   manuscript is referred to as `integrated thermal energy and rainwater
   storage' (ITHERST).
   The model used simulated cooling load data for a typical home in Austin,
   Texas, based on summer 2011 historical and typical meteorological year
   (TMY) datasets. The analysis suggests that the ITHERST system with
   3785-18,9251 of water could reduce on-peak compressor power demand by
   approximately 29-53\%, as compared to a traditional AC with an
   air-cooled condenser. However, total compressor energy consumption
   increases 5-15\% because of the inefficiencies of re-cooling the thermal
   mass, but this additional energy consumption occurs during low demand
   off-peak hours. System performance varied depending on weather data, the
   individual compressor, and thermal storage volume. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Thermally responsive hydrogels have drawn significant research attention
   recently because of their simple use as drug carrier at human body
   temperature. Here we design a hybrid hydrogel that incorporates a
   hydrophilic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), into the thermally
   responsive hydrogel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm), as a general
   drug carrier model for controlled drug release. In this work, on one
   hand, PEI modifies the structure and the size of the pores in the PNIPAm
   hydrogel. On the other hand, PEI plays an important role in tuning the
   water content in the hydrogel and controls the water release rate of the
   hydrogel below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), resulting
   in a tunable release rate of the drugs at human body temperature (37
   degrees C). Different release rates are shown as different amounts of
   PEI are incorporated. PEI controls the release rate, dependent on the
   charge characteristics of the drugs. The hydrogel blends described in
   this work extend the concept of a general drug carrier for loading both
   positively and negatively charged drugs, as well as the controlled
   release effect.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium sulfur and lithium air batteries offer theoretical energy
   densities an order of magnitude higher than that of current lithium-ion
   batteries and are considered as promising candidates as the
   next-generation battery chemistries. For an efficient use of these new
   battery chemistries, careful selection of suitable electrode
   materials/structures is critical. Graphene, a unique two-dimensional
   nanomaterial, with its superior electronic conductivity, mechanical
   strength, and flexibility has been successfully applied in battery
   studies. Graphene, even with imperfect layers, will be of great interest
   to battery industrial applications if the manufacturing cost is reduced.
   Herein, we demonstrate the application of low-cost graphene
   sponge/sheets derived from expandable graphite in both lithium sulfur
   and hybrid lithium air batteries, respectively, as a cathode conductive
   matrix to accommodate the soluble poly- sulfides and as a catalyst for
   the oxygen reduction reaction. High utilization of active materials and
   good cycling stability are realized in lithium sulfur and hybrid lithium
   air batteries by employing this low-cost material, demonstrating its
   promise for use in next-generation battery chemistries. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider phase-field based fracture propagation in
   elastic media. The main purpose is the development of a robust and
   efficient numerical scheme. To enforce crack irreversibility as a
   constraint, we use a primal-dual active set strategy, which can be
   identified as a semi-smooth Newton method. The active set iteration is
   merged with the Newton iteration for solving the fully-coupled nonlinear
   partial differential equation discretized using finite elements,
   resulting in a single, rapidly converging nonlinear scheme. It is well
   known that phase-field models require fine meshes to accurately capture
   the propagation dynamics of the crack. Because traditional estimators
   based on adaptive mesh refinement schemes are not appropriate, we
   develop a predictor-corrector scheme for local mesh adaptivity to reduce
   the computational cost. This method is both robust and efficient and
   allows us to treat temporal and spatial refinements and to study the
   influence of model regularization parameters. Finally, our proposed
   approach is substantiated with different numerical tests for crack
   propagation in elastic media and pressurized fracture propagation in
   homogeneous and heterogeneous media. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Investigation of ultra-light weight proppant application in shale
   fracturing}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{191-201}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Horizontal wells with long propped fractures are needed to maximize
   productivity for ultra-low permeability shale and tight reservoirs.
   Conventional slickwater fracturing with sand can produce long fractures,
   but only the near wellbore region is propped due to fast settling of
   sand in water. Ultra-light weight proppants (ULWPs) can be used to
   reduce proppant settling. A comprehensive investigation of ULWP
   performance in shale reservoirs has been conducted by utilizing fracture
   conductivity experiments, fracture modeling and reservoir simulation.
   Based on experimental fracture conductivity measurements, empirical
   conductivity correlations are developed for the three ULWPs as a
   function of proppant areal concentration at reservoir confining stress
   and temperature. A fracturing model is used to predict the proppant
   concentration distributions during fracturing operations from which
   conductivity distribution along fractures is estimated. The conductivity
   distribution is then put into a reservoir simulator to predict gas
   production from a fractured shale well. Simulation study shows that at
   the same injection concentration in slickwater, all three ULWPs create
   more propped area and longer propped distance than sand, but the
   fracture conductivity is significantly lower. ULWPs have strong
   productivity advantages over sand in 0.1 mu D gas reservoir by creating
   more propped areas. The productivity advantage of using ULWPs decreases
   with increasing reservoir permeability and decreasing production time.
   For 1 year production and 0.1 mu D shale reservoirs, the acceptable
   maximum price is \$10/lb for ULW-1, \$6/lb for ULW-2, and \$2.5/lb for
   ULW-3. The maximum price increases as production time increases. By
   adding small amount of ULWPs into sand, both the high conductivity zone
   at the bottom and low conductivity zone at the upper and deeper zones
   can be achieved, which benefits both short and long-term production. (C)

Abstract = {{A voltage-controlled ring oscillator is implemented with double-gate
   complementary transistors where both the n- and p-channel semiconductors
   are deposited by inkjet printing. Top gates added to transistors in
   conventional ring oscillator circuits control not only threshold
   voltages of the constituent transistors but also the oscillation
   frequencies of the ring oscillators. The oscillation frequency increases
   or decreases linearly with applied top gate potential. The field-effect
   transistor materials system that yields such linear behavior has not
   been previously reported. In this work, we demonstrate details of a
   material system (gate insulator, p- and n-channel semiconductors) that
   results in very linear frequency changes with control gate potential.
   Our use of a double layer top dielectric consisting of a combination of
   solution processed P(VDF-TrFE) and Al2O3 deposited by atomic layer
   deposition leads to low operating voltages and near-optimal device
   characteristics from a circuit standpoint. Such functional blocks will

Title = {{Accurately decoding visual information from fMRI data obtained in a
   realistic virtual environment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional interactive virtual environments (VEs) are a powerful
   tool for brain-imaging based cognitive neuroscience that are presently
   under-utilized. This paper presents machine-learning based methods for
   identifying brain states induced by realistic VEs with improved accuracy
   as well as the capability for mapping their spatial topography on the
   neocortex. VEs provide the ability to study the brain under conditions
   closer to the environment in which humans evolved, and thus to probe
   deeper into the complexities of human cognition. As a test case, we
   designed a stimulus to reflect a military combat situation in the Middle
   East, motivated by the potential of using real-time functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in the treatment of post-traumatic stress
   disorder. Each subject experienced moving through the virtual town where
   they encountered 1-6 animated combatants at different locations, while
   fMRI data was collected. To analyze the data from what is, compared to
   most studies, more complex and less controlled stimuli, we employed
   statistical machine learning in the form of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis
   (MVPA) with special attention given to artificial Neural Networks (NN).
   Extensions to NN that exploit the block structure of the stimulus were
   developed to improve the accuracy of the classification, achieving
   performances from 58 to 93\% (chance was 16.7\%) with six subjects. This
   demonstrates that MVPA can decode a complex cognitive state, viewing a
   number of characters, in a dynamic virtual environment. To better
   understand the source of this information in the brain, a novel form of
   sensitivity analysis was developed to use NN to quantify the degree to
   which each voxel contributed to classification. Compared with maps
   produced by general linear models and the searchlight approach, these
   sensitivity maps revealed a more diverse pattern of information relevant
   to the classification of cognitive state.}},

Abstract = {{Wave models that have been used to extract the biomechanical properties
   of the cornea from the propagation of an elastic wave are based on an
   assumption of thin-plate geometry. However, this assumption does not
   account for the effects of corneal curvature and thickness. This study
   conducts finite element (FE) simulations on four types of cornea-like
   structures as well as optical coherence elastography (OCE) experiments
   on contact lenses and tissue-mimicking phantoms to investigate the
   effects of curvature and thickness on the group velocity of an elastic
   wave. The elastic wave velocity as determined by FE simulations and OCE
   of a spherical shell section decreased from similar to 2.8 m/s to
   similar to 2.2 m/s as the radius of curvature increased from 19.1 mm to
   47.7 mm and increased from similar to 3.0 m/s to similar to 4.1 m/s as
   the thickness of the agar phantom increased from 1.9 mm to 5.6 mm. Both
   the FE simulation and OCE results confirm that the group velocity of the
   elastic wave decreases with radius of curvature but increases with
   thickness. These results demonstrate that the effects of the curvature
   and thickness must be considered in the further development of accurate
   wave models for reconstructing biomechanical properties of the cornea.

Abstract = {{In this study the dynamic behavior of a layered viscoelastic medium in
   response to the harmonic and impulsive acoustic radiation force applied
   to its surface was investigated both theoretically and experimentally.
   An analytical solution for a layered viscoelastic compressible medium in
   frequency and time domains was obtained using the Hankel transform. A
   special incompressible case was considered to model soft biological
   tissues. To verify our theoretical model, experiments were performed
   using tissue-like gel-based phantoms with varying mechanical properties.
   A 3.5 MHz single-element focused ultrasound transducer was used to apply
   the radiation force at the surface of the phantoms. A phase-sensitive
   optical coherence tomography system was used to track the displacements
   of the phantom surface. Theoretically predicted displacements were
   compared with experimental measurements. The role of the depth
   dependence of the elastic properties of a medium in its response to an
   acoustic pulse at the surface was studied. It was shown that the
   low-frequency vibrations at the surface are more sensitive to the deep
   layers than high-frequency ones. Therefore, the proposed model in
   combination with spectral analysis can be used to evaluate
   depth-dependent distribution of the mechanical properties based on the
   measurements of the surface deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed flame measurements are necessary for the development of
   accurate chemical kinetics models. This study characterizes quasi
   one-dimensional, laminar, nearly adiabatic, and freely propagating
   flames stabilized over a Hencken flat flame burner. Major reactant and
   product species in lean premixed methane/oxygen/argon and
   ethylene/oxygen/argon flames were measured through extractive sampling
   and absorption spectroscopy to obtain spatially-resolved species
   profiles of oxygen, methane, ethylene, carbon monoxide and carbon
   dioxide. Experimental results were compared to numerical simulations of
   one-dimensional, freely propagating, adiabatic flames. Experimental and
   numerical results for flame speeds and species concentrations were
   largely in agreement within calculated uncertainty, indicating that data
   produced using a Hencken burner at sub-atmospheric pressure can be
   readily compared to numerical simulations without the need for flame or
   burner temperatures, which are prone to uncertainty. The influence of
   the extractive probe on flame structure was also investigated, and
   results suggest that the structure is less influenced by probe intrusion
   when the flame is highly stretched. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{An improved sparse subspace clustering (ISSC) method is proposed to
   select an appropriate band subset for hyperspectral imagery (HSI)
   classification. The ISSC assumes that band vectors are sampled from a
   union of low-dimensional orthogonal subspaces and each band can be
   sparsely represented as a linear or affine combination of other bands
   within its subspace. First, the ISSC represents band vectors with sparse
   coefficient vectors by solving the L2-norm optimization problem using
   the least square regression (LSR) algorithm. The sparse and block
   diagonal structure of the coefficient matrix from LSR leads to correct
   segmentation of band vectors. Second, the angular similarity measurement
   is presented and utilized to construct the similarity matrix. Third, the
   distribution compactness (DC) plot algorithm is used to estimate an
   appropriate size of the band subset. Finally, spectral clustering is
   implemented to segment the similarity matrix and the desired ISSC band
   subset is found. Four groups of experiments on three widely used HSI
   datasets are performed to test the performance of ISSC for selecting
   bands in classification. In addition, the following six state-of-the-art
   band selection methods are used to make comparisons: linear constrained
   minimum variance-based band correlation constraint (LCMV-BCC), affinity
   propagation (AP), spectral information divergence (SID),
   maximum-variance principal component analysis (MVPCA), sparse
   representation-based band selection (SpaBS), and sparse nonnegative
   matrix factorization (SNMF). Experimental results show that the ISSC has
   the second shortest computational time and also outperforms the other
   six methods in classification accuracy when using an appropriate band
   number obtained by the DC plot algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We explore tracer breakthrough profiles (TBP) as a macroscopic property
   to infer the pore-space topology of tight gas sandstone and carbonate
   rocks at the core scale. The following features were modeled via
   three-dimensional multiscale networks: microporosity within dissolved
   grains and pore-filling clay, cementation in the absence and presence of
   microporosity (each classified into uniform, pore-preferred, and
   throat-preferred modes), layering, vug, and microcrack inclusion. A
   priori knowledge of the extent and location of each process was assumed
   to be known. With the exception of an equal importance of macropores and
   pore-filling micropores, TBPs show little sensitivity to the fraction of
   micropores present. In general, significant sensitivity of the TBPs was
   observed for uniform and throat-preferred cementation. Layering parallel
   to the fluid flow direction had a considerable impact on TBPs whereas
   layering perpendicular to flow did not. Microcrack orientations seemed
   of minor importance in affecting TBPs.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the difficulty of coordination in the cellular uplink, it is a
   practical challenge how to achieve the optimal throughput scaling with
   distributed scheduling. In this paper, we propose a distributed and
   opportunistic user scheduling (DOUS) that achieves the optimal
   throughput scaling in a single-input multiple-output interfering
   multiple-access channel, i. e., a multi-cell uplink network, with M
   antennas at each base station (BS) and N users in a cell. In a
   distributed fashion, each BS adopts M random receive beamforming vectors
   and then selects M users such that both sufficiently large desired
   signal power and sufficiently small generating interference are
   guaranteed. As a main result, it is proved that full multiuser diversity
   gain can be achieved in each cell when a sufficiently large number of
   users exist. Numerical evaluation confirms that in a practical setting
   of the multi-cell network, the proposed DOUS outperforms the existing
   distributed user scheduling algorithms in terms of sum-rate.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work chitosan-silver (CS/Ag) nanocomposites, either in
   the form of nanoparticles (AgNP) or as ionic dendritic structures (Ag+),
   are synthesized by a simple and environmentally friendly in situ
   chemical reduction process. The antibacterial activity of the resulting
   nanocomposites in the form of films is studied against two bacteria,
   Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli.
   The relationship between electrical, structural and antibacterial
   properties of CS/AgNP and CS/Ag+ nanocomposites are studied by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), X-ray diffraction, and UV-Vis, impedance, infrared and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopies. The results demonstrate that in contrast
   to CS/Ag+ ion films, the CS/AgNP composites films (average particle size
   less than 10 nm) showed a significantly higher antibacterial potency.
   The collective action of AgNP and Ag+ ions facilitate the enhancement
   and synergetic antibacterial activity below certain critical
   concentration. The bactericide activity of both CS/AgNP and CS/Ag+ ion
   composite films increases by increasing the concentration of Ag. The
   composites containing 1 wt.\% of silver nanoparticles and about of 2
   wt.\% of silver ions exhibit a maximum antibacterial activity, which is
   close to their electrical percolation threshold. The concentration of
   AgNP and Ag+ ions above the threshold level greatly diminish the
   antibacterial potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provides monthly
   solutions for the Earth's gravity field in the form of spherical
   harmonic coefficients. These can be used to infer changes in mass at the
   Earth's surface. The pole tide (the response of the Earth and oceans to
   polar motion) causes gravity signals dominated by harmonics of degree 2,
   order 1. If the pole tide is not removed from GRACE data, it affects the
   coefficients of those harmonics (C-21, S-21) and introduces errors when
   using those coefficients to determine surface mass variations. The pole
   tide is partially removed by GRACE processing centers before solving for
   the gravity field. But long-period pole tide signals are not usually
   included in the GRACE pole tide correction, and so those signals are
   still present in the GRACE coefficients. We discuss this issue from the
   standpoint of somebody who uses the GRACE gravity fields to infer
   changes in surface mass. We arrive at a recommendation for an optimal
   GRACE pole tide correction. We describe how to modify the C-21, S-21
   coefficients provided by the processing centers, so that they conform
   with our recommendation. We discuss the size of the pole tide
   contributions to C-21, S-21, compared to those of the direct
   load-induced contributions. As an example, we show how an incompletely
   removed pole tide can impact GRACE results for the trend in ocean mass.
   We consider the impact of mantle anelasticity on long-period pole tide
   corrections and conclude that it is unlikely to affect those corrections
   by more than 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{Landfill cover soils have to serve multiple purposes such as operational
   safety, environmental protection, recultivation and integration of the
   sites into the landscape. Cover soil properties must therefore be
   defined with respect to the thickness, bulk density, air permeability
   and the available field capacity. The primary objective of this study is
   to examine the cover soil properties of three selected landfill sites
   (dumpsites) in Sri Lanka in order to propose suitable cover soil
   properties for similar applications in future dumpsites. Soil samples
   were obtained from three landfill sites in and around the city of
   Colombo. Laboratory tests to establish compaction characteristics, air
   permeability, particle size distribution and Atterberg limits were
   performed to assess the suitability as landfill cover soils. The study
   showed that landfill covers with well graded soils comply with the dry
   density and air permeability values, as per the guidelines. In the
   absence of proper gas venting facilities, it is essential to study the
   permeability properties of the cover soil. All three landfill sites
   tested need to be retrofitted with leachate and gas collecting systems
   that meet the standards stipulated in the guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies indicate that exposure of fish to pristine
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by oral gavage, causes no overt
   toxicity, and no appreciable absorption has been observed. However, in
   the environment, SWCNTs are likely to be present in dietary sources,
   which may result in differential impacts on uptake and biological
   effects. Additionally, the potential of these materials to sorb
   nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids) while present in the
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract may lead to nutrient depletion conditions
   that impact processes such as growth and reproduction. To test this
   phenomenon, fathead minnows were fed a commercial diet either with or
   without SWCNTs for 96 h. Tracking and quantification of SWCNTs using
   near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging during feeding studies showed
   the presence of food does not facilitate transport of SWCNTs across the
   intestinal epithelia. Targeting genes shown to be responsive to nutrient
   depletion (peptide transporters, peptide hormones, and lipases)
   indicated that pept2, a peptide transporter, and cck, a peptide hormone,
   showed differential mRNA expression by 96 h, a response that may be
   indicative of nutrient limitation. The results of the current study
   increase our understanding of the movement of SWCNTs through the GI
   tract, while the changes in nutrient processing genes highlight a novel
   mechanism of sublethal toxicity in aquatic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{189 conditioned residential single-family and multi-family homes in the
   cooling-dominated climate of Texas were instrumented with home energy
   management systems (HEMS) to collect sub-metered data on HVAC
   operations. This study analyses the HVAC operation from these homes over
   a 1-year period to determine the duty cycles of the HVAC systems. This
   includes annual, monthly, and hourly HVAC ON-OFF operation patterns.
   Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship to HVAC
   energy use and whole-home energy use, and the influence of building and
   occupant characteristics. HVAC runtimes are found to be approximately
   20\% per year, but vary, depending on the season and time of day. Daily
   and monthly runtime fractions are lowest (10\%) at average outdoor
   temperatures of 15 degrees C, and increase with increasing or decreasing
   temperature. Hourly runtime peaks at 7 pm in the cooling season, while
   in the heating and transition seasons, it peaks at 7 am. The number of
   occupants and the indoor cooling set point temperature were found to
   most strongly influence the HVAC runtime. The results are formatted to
   be used in various building and indoor air quality applications where
   the studied phenomena are influenced by HVAC operation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Different structural chemistries resulting from the Pb2+ lone-pair
   electrons in the PbMO3 perovskites are reviewed. The Pb2+ lone-pair
   electrons enhance the ferroelectric transition temperature in PbTiO3,
   stabilize vanadyl formation in PbVO3, and induce a disproportionation
   reaction of CrIV in PbCrO3. A Pb2+ + Ni-IV= Pb4++ Ni-II reaction in
   PbNiO3 stabilizes the LiNbO3 structure at ambient pressure, but an
   A-site Pb4+ in an orthorhombic perovskite PbNiO3 is stabilized at modest
   pressures at room temperature. In PbMnO3, a ferroelectric displacement
   due to the lone pair electron effect is minimized by the spin-spin
   exchange interaction and the strong octahedral site preference of the

Abstract = {{Implantable endovascular devices such as bare metal, drug eluting, and
   bioresorbable stents have transformed interventional care by providing
   continuous structural and mechanical support to many peripheral, neural,
   and coronary arteries affected by blockage. Although effective in
   achieving immediate restoration of blood flow, the long-term
   re-endothelialization and inflammation induced by mechanical stents are
   difficult to diagnose or treat. Here we present nanomaterial designs and
   integration strategies for the bioresorbable electronic stent with
   drug-infused functionalized nanoparticles to enable flow sensing,
   temperature monitoring, data storage, wireless power/data transmission,
   inflammation suppression, localized drug delivery, and hyperthermia
   therapy. In vivo and ex vivo animal experiments as well as in vitro cell
   studies demonstrate the previously unrecognized potential for
   bioresorbable electronic implants coupled with bioinert therapeutic
   nanoparticles in the endovascular system.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed moire nanosphere lithography (M-NSL), which
   incorporates in plane rotation between neighboring monolayers, to extend
   the patterning capability of conventional nanosphere lithography (NSL).
   NSL, which uses self-assembled layers of nnonodisperse micro/nanospheres
   as masks, is a low-cost, scalable nanofabrication technique and has been
   widely employed to fabricate various nanoparticle arrays. Combination
   with dry etching and/or angled deposition has greatly enriched the
   family of nanoparticles NSL can yield. In this work, we introduce a
   variant of this technique, which uses sequential stacking of polystyrene
   nanosphere monolayers to form a bilayer crystal instead of conventional
   spontaneous self-assembly. Sequential stacking leads to the formation of
   moire patterns other than the usually observed thermodynamically stable
   configurations. Subsequent O-2 plasma etching results in a variety of
   complex nanostructures. Using the etched moire patterns as masks, we
   have fabricated complementary gold nanostructures and studied their
   optical properties. We believe this facile technique provides a strategy
   to fabricate complex nanostructures or metasurfaces.}},

Title = {{Effect of Particle Size and Operating Conditions on Pt3Co PEMFC Cathode
   Catalyst Durability}},
Journal = {{CATALYSTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{926-948}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The initial performance and decay trends of polymer electrolyte membrane
   fuel cells (PEMFC) cathodes with Pt3Co catalysts of three mean particle
   sizes (4.9 nm, 8.1 nm, and 14.8 nm) with identical Pt loadings are
   compared. Even though the cathode based on 4.9 nm catalyst exhibited the
   highest initial electrochemical surface area (ECA) and mass activity,
   the cathode based on 8.1 nm catalyst showed better initial performance
   at high currents. Owing to the low mass activity of the large particles,
   the initial performance of the 14.8 nm Pt3Co-based electrode was the
   lowest. The performance decay rate of the electrodes with the smallest
   Pt3Co particle size was the highest and that of the largest Pt3Co
   particle size was lowest. Interestingly, with increasing number of decay
   cycles (0.6 to 1.0 V, 50 mV/s), the relative improvement in performance
   of the cathode based on 8.1 nm Pt3Co over the 4.9 nm Pt3Co increased,
   owing to better stability of the 8.1 nm catalyst. The electron
   microprobe analysis (EMPA) of the decayed membrane-electrode assembly
   (MEA) showed that the amount of Co in the membrane was lower for the
   larger particles, and the platinum loss into the membrane also decreased
   with increasing particle size. This suggests that the higher initial
   performance at high currents with 8.1 nm Pt3Co could be due to lower
   contamination of the ionomer in the electrode. Furthermore, lower loss
   of Co from the catalyst with increased particle size could be one of the
   factors contributing to the stability of ECA and mass activity of
   electrodes with larger cathode catalyst particles. To delineate the
   impact of particle size and alloy effects, these results are compared
   with prior work from our research group on size effects of pure platinum
   catalysts. The impact of PEMFC operating conditions, including upper
   potential, relative humidity, and temperature on the alloy catalyst
   decay trends, along with the EMPA analysis of the decayed MEAs, are
   reported.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Energy and water systems are interconnected. This work first
   characterizes 2010 primary energy demand for direct water services and
   local freshwater demand for energy on Maui Island, Hawaii, then
   investigates scenarios for future changes in these demands. The goal of
   this manuscript is to dissect the relationship and trends of
   energy-water connections to inform policymaking decisions related to
   water and energy planning. Analysis proceeds by inventorying water and
   energy flows and adjusting to a 2010 base year, then applying intensity
   factors for energy or water used at a given stage for a given sector to
   determine absolute energy and water demands for the isolated system of
   Maui Island. These bottom-up, intensity-based values are validated
   against published data where available. Maui consumes about 0.05\% of
   its freshwater for energy (versus >6\% for the US on average) and about
   32\% of its electricity (19\% of its on-island primary energy) for
   direct water services (versus 8\% of primary energy for the US on
   average). These values could change with policy choices like increased
   instream flows, higher wastewater treatment standards, electricity fuel
   mix changes, desalination, or increased biofuels production. This letter
   contributes a granular assessment of both energy for water and water for
   energy in a single isolated system, highlighting opportunities to
   address energy-water interdependencies in a context that could be
   relevant in other communities facing similar choices.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Concentrated piperazine is a promising new solvent under consideration
   for post combustion capture (PCC) of CO2. As it is a secondary amine,
   one of the concerns when applying this solvent to flue gases is the
   potential formation of nitrosamines. Secondary amines will form stable
   nitrosamines, which are generally considered to be carcinogens. The
   Tarong CO2 capture pilot plant was recently used to evaluate the
   concentrated piperazine process on a real coal flue gas. During duration
   operation completed at the plant, solvent samples were regularly
   collected and analysed for their nitrosamine content.
   Mononitrosopiperazine (MNPZ) concentration in the solvent was noted to
   increase with operating time, reaching a steady state level of
   approximately 7.5 mmol/kg when operating with a regeneration temperature
   in the stripping column of 125 degrees C. The concentration of MNPZ in
   the solvent was noted to decrease sharply to 2.5 mmol/kg when the
   regeneration temperature was increased to 155 degrees C. The results
   provided here suggest that the concentration of MNPZ formed in the
   solvent can be controlled through the choice of plant operating
   conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Revealing the planar chemistry of two-dimensional heterostructures at
   the atomic level}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals and their heterostructures are an
   intense area of study owing to their unique properties that result from
   structural planar confinement. Intrinsically, the performance of a
   planar vertical device is linked to the quality of its 2D components and
   their interfaces, therefore requiring characterization tools that can
   reveal both its planar chemistry and morphology. Here, we propose a
   characterization methodology combining (micro-) Raman spectroscopy,
   atomic force microscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass
   spectrometry to provide structural information, morphology and planar
   chemical composition at virtually the atomic level, aimed specifically
   at studying 2D vertical heterostructures. As an example system, a
   graphene-on-h-BN heterostructure is analysed to reveal, with an
   unprecedented level of detail, the subtle chemistry and interactions

Abstract = {{Background Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) has a low sensitivity.
   Electroanatomic voltage mapping (EVM) is effective in guiding EMB thanks
   to its ability in identifying and locating low-voltage regions. The
   analysis of unipolar EVM can correlate with epicardial pathological
   involvement. We evaluated the unipolar EVM in EMB areas to determine
   whether it can increase EMB sensitivity in diagnosing epicardial
   diseases.
   Methods and Results We performed endocardial bipolar EVM-guided EMBs in
   29 patients and we analyzed unipolar EVM at withdrawal sites. Eighty
   myocardial samples were collected (mean, 2.80.9; median, 3 fragments per
   patient) and 60 were suitable for histological analysis. Ten specimens
   (17\%) were collected from an area with discordant normal
   bipolar/low-voltage unipolar EVM and they were diagnostic or suggestive
   for arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy in 6
   patients, for myocarditis and sarcoidosis in 1 patient each. Six samples
   (10\%) were collected from an area with discordant low-voltage
   bipolar/normal unipolar EVM and they showed nonspecific features. The
   sensitivity of unipolar EVMs for a diagnostic biopsy finding EMB was
   significantly higher compared with bipolar EVMs analyzed according to
   samples (P<0.01) and patients (P=0.008). The specificity of unipolar EMB
   was better than bipolar EMB when analyzed for all samples (P=0.0014) but
   the difference did not reach statistical significance when analyzed by
   patient (P=0.083). The diagnostic yield was 63.3\% for the bipolar and
   83.3\% for the unipolar EVM.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that use of a combined
   bipolar/unipolar map may be able to improve the diagnostic yield of
   endomyocardial ventricular biopsy.}},

Title = {{Building bridges across electronic health record systems through
   inferred phenotypic topics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{82-93}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Data in electronic health records (EHRs) is being
   increasingly leveraged for secondary uses, ranging from biomedical
   association studies to comparative effectiveness. To perform studies at
   scale and transfer knowledge from one institution to another in a
   meaningful way, we need to harmonize the phenotypes in such systems.
   Traditionally, this has been accomplished through expert specification
   of phenotypes via standardized terminologies, such as billing codes.
   However, this approach may be biased by the experience and expectations
   of the experts, as well as the vocabulary used to describe such
   patients. The goal of this work is to develop a data-driven strategy to
   (1) infer phenotypic topics within patient populations and (2) assess
   the degree to which such topics facilitate a mapping across populations
   in disparate healthcare systems.
   Methods: We adapt a generative topic modeling strategy, based on latent
   Dirichlet allocation, to infer phenotypic topics. We utilize a variance
   analysis to assess the projection of a patient population from one
   healthcare system onto the topics learned from another system. The
   consistency of learned phenotypic topics was evaluated using (1) the
   similarity of topics, (2) the stability of a patient population across
   topics, and (3) the transferability of a topic across sites. We
   evaluated our approaches using four months of inpatient data from two
   geographically distinct healthcare systems: (1) Northwestern Memorial
   Hospital (NMH) and (2) Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).
   Results: The method learned 25 phenotypic topics from each healthcare
   system. The average cosine similarity between matched topics across the
   two sites was 0.39, a remarkably high value given the very high
   dimensionality of the feature space. The average stability of VUMC and
   NMH patients across the topics of two sites was 0.988 and 0.812,
   respectively, as measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Also
   the VUMC and NMH topics have smaller variance of characterizing patient
   population of two sites than standard clinical terminologies (e.g.,
   ICD9), suggesting they may be more reliably transferred across hospital
   systems.
   Conclusions: Phenotypic topics learned from EHR data can be more stable
   and transferable than billing codes for characterizing the general
   status of a patient population. This suggests that EHR-based research
   may be able to leverage such phenotypic topics as variables when pooling
   patient populations in predictive models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{21-43}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogels are capable of coupled mass transport and large deformation in
   response to external stimuli. In this paper, a nonlinear, transient
   finite element formulation is presented for initial boundary value
   problems associated with swelling and deformation of hydrogels, based on
   a nonlinear continuum theory that is consistent with classical theory of
   linear poroelasticity. A mixed finite element method is implemented with
   implicit time integration. The incompressible or nearly incompressible
   behavior at the initial stage imposes a constraint to the finite element
   discretization in order to satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi
   (LBB) condition for stability of the mixed method, similar to linear
   poroelasticity as well as incompressible elasticity and Stokes flow;
   failure to choose an appropriate discretization would result in locking
   and numerical oscillations in transient analysis. To demonstrate the
   numerical method, two problems of practical interests are considered:
   constrained swelling and flat-punch indentation of hydrogel layers.
   Constrained swelling may lead to instantaneous surface instability for a
   soft hydrogel in a good solvent, which can be regulated by assuming a
   stiff surface layer. Indentation relaxation of hydrogels is simulated
   beyond the linear regime under plane strain conditions, in comparison
   with two elastic limits for the instantaneous and equilibrium states.
   The effects of Poisson's ratio and loading rate are discussed. It is
   concluded that the present finite element method is robust and can be
   extended to study other transient phenomena in hydrogels. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In a device-to-device (D2D) underlaid cellular network, the uplink
   spectrum is reused by the D2D transmissions, causing mutual interference
   with the ongoing cellular transmissions. Massive MIMO is appealing in
   such a context as the base station's (BS's) large antenna array can
   nearly null the D2D-to-BS interference. The multi-user transmission in
   massive MIMO, however, may lead to increased cellular-to-D2D
   interference. This paper studies the interplay between massive MIMO and
   underlaid D2D networking in a multi-cell setting. We investigate
   cellular and D2D spectral efficiencies under both perfect and imperfect
   channel state information (CSI) at the receivers that employ partial
   zero-forcing. Compared to the case without D2D, there is a loss in
   cellular spectral efficiency due to D2D underlay. With perfect CSI, the
   loss can be completely overcome if the number of canceled D2D
   interfering signals is scaled with the number of BS antennas at an
   arbitrarily slow rate. With imperfect CSI, in addition to pilot
   contamination, a new asymptotic effect termed underlay contamination
   arises. In the non-asymptotic regime, simple analytical lower bounds are
   derived for both the cellular and D2D spectral efficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{We report here a ferrocene-based membrane-free, high-rate semiliquid
   battery that takes advantage of a highly soluble ferrocene/ferrocenium
   redox couple in nonaqueous phase. The designed battery exhibits stable
   capacity retention up to 94\% of theoretical capacity of ferrocene (145
   mAh g(-1)) at a broad current rate up to 60 C owing to rapid mass
   transport in a liquid phase and fast redox kinetics. The diffusion
   coefficient and the standard reaction constant are determined to be in
   the order of 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) and 10(-1) cm s(-1), respectively,
   orders of magnitude greater than those in a solid-phase electrode and
   those in conventional redox flow batteries. Additionally, the battery
   demonstrates power density and energy density exceeding 1400 W L-1 and
   40 Wh L-1, respectively, and stable cyclability with capacity retention
   of similar to 80\% for 500 cycles. Compared with state-of-the-art energy

Title = {{A Generalized Method for the Analysis of Planar Biaxial Mechanical Data
   Using Tethered Testing Configurations}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of the mechanical behavior of soft tissues is critical for
   many physiological and medical device applications. Accurate mechanical
   test data is crucial for both obtaining the form and robust parameter
   determination of the constitutive model. For incompressible soft tissues
   that are either membranes or thin sections, planar biaxial mechanical
   testing configurations can provide much information about the
   anisotropic stress-strain behavior. However, the analysis of soft
   biological tissue planar biaxial mechanical test data can be complicated
   by in-plane shear, tissue heterogeneities, and inelastic changes in
   specimen geometry that commonly occur during testing. These inelastic
   effects, without appropriate corrections, alter the stress-traction
   mapping and violates equilibrium so that the stress tensor is
   incorrectly determined. To overcome these problems, we presented an
   analytical method to determine the Cauchy stress tensor from the
   experimentally derived tractions for tethered testing configurations. We
   accounted for the measured testing geometry and compensate for run-time
   inelastic effects by enforcing equilibrium using small rigid body
   rotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we simulated
   complete planar biaxial test configurations that incorporated actual
   device mechanisms, specimen geometry, and heterogeneous tissue fibrous
   structure using a finite element (FE) model. We determined that our
   method corrected the errors in the equilibrium of momentum and correctly
   estimated the Cauchy stress tensor. We also noted that since stress is
   applied primarily over a subregion bounded by the tethers, an adjustment
   to the effective specimen dimensions is required to correct the
   magnitude of the stresses. Simulations of various tether placements
   demonstrated that typical tether placements used in the current
   experimental setups will produce accurate stress tensor estimates.
   Overall, our method provides an improved and relatively straightforward
   method of calculating the resulting stresses for planar biaxial
   experiments for tethered configurations, which is especially useful for
   specimens that undergo large shear and exhibit substantial inelastic
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a parallel implementation of point
   dipole-based polarizable force fields for molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The smooth particle
   mesh Ewald technique is combined with two optimal iterative strategies,
   namely, a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver and a Jacobi solver
   in conjunction with the direct inversion in the iterative subspace for
   convergence acceleration, to solve the polarization equations. We show
   that both solvers exhibit very good parallel performances and overall
   very competitive timings in an energy and force computation needed to
   perform a MD step. Various tests on large systems are provided in the
   context of the polarizable AMOEBA force field as implemented in the
   newly developed Tinker-HP package, which is the first implementation of
   a polarizable model that makes large-scale experiments for massively
   parallel PBC point dipole models possible. We show that using a large
   number of cores offers a significant acceleration of the overall process
   involving the iterative methods within the context of SPME and a
   noticeable improvement of the memory management, giving access to very
   large systems (hundreds of thousands of atoms) as the algorithm
   naturally distributes the data on different cores. Coupled with advanced
   MD techniques, gains ranging from 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in time are
   now possible compared to nonoptimized, sequential implementations,
   giving new directions for polarizable molecular dynamics with periodic
   boundary conditions using massively parallel implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Classical molecular mechanics force fields typically model interatomic
   electrostatic interactions with point charges or multipole expansions,
   which can fail for atoms in close contact due to the lack of a
   description of penetration effects between their electron clouds. These
   short-range penetration effects can be significant and are essential for
   accurate modeling of intermolecular interactions. In this work we report
   parametrization of an empirical charge charge function previously
   reported (Piquemal, J.-P.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2003, 107, 10353) to
   correct for the missing penetration term in standard molecular mechanics
   force fields. For this purpose, we have developed a database (S101X7) of
   101 unique molecular dimers, each at 7 different intermolecular
   distances. Electrostatic, induction/polarization, repulsion, and
   dispersion energies, as well as the total interaction energy for each
   complex in the database are calculated using the SAPT2+ method (Parker,
   T. M.; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2014, 140, 094106). This empirical
   penetration model significantly improves agreement between point
   multipole and quantum mechanical electrostatic energies across the set
   of dimers and distances, while using only a limited set of parameters
   for each chemical element. Given the simplicity and effectiveness of the
   model, we expect the electrostatic penetration correction will become a
   standard component of future molecular mechanics force fields.}},

Title = {{Anisotropic Dispersion and Upscaling for Miscible Displacement}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{421-432}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Dispersion is the irreversible mixing that occurs during miscible
   displacements. Dispersion can reduce local displacement efficiency by
   lessening solvent peak concentration or increase volumetric sweep
   efficiency by spreading of the injected solvent to more of the
   reservoir. Dispersion is therefore an important parameter in predicting
   and simulating miscible displacements. The difficulty of simulating
   miscible displacement and understanding the effect of dispersion is also
   compounded by numerical dispersion, which increases the apparent
   dispersion in finite-difference simulation models.
   This paper presents an approach to estimate the total longitudinal and
   transverse dispersion in large-scale media by use of continuous solvent
   injection in a medium of finite thickness. The simulations are based on
   the experimental arrangement of Black-well (1962) to estimate transverse
   dispersion, with experiments consisting of coinjecting two miscible
   fluids into different sections of the medium at similar rates. This
   model arrangement, coupled with analytical solutions for the 2D
   convection/dispersion equation for a continuously injected solvent,
   allows us to determine longitudinal and transverse dispersivity
   simultaneously for the flow medium. In this manner, we investigate the
   effects of stochastic permeability distributions and other scaling
   groups affecting first-contact-miscible simulations on dispersion.
   Sensitivity analysis of dispersion in stochastic permeability fields
   confirms that both longitudinal and transverse dispersion are scale
   dependent. Results also show that the effect of increasing
   autocorrelation of cell permeability in the longitudinal direction
   (parallel to flow) is to increase longitudinal dispersion, as solvent
   travels through more continuous layers, while reducing transverse
   dispersion. Increasing autocorrelation in the transverse direction
   reduces dispersion in both directions. This reduction is caused by
   equilibration of solvent concentrations in continuous sections of the
   reservoir, resulting in reduced solute fingering and channeling.
   Finally, we developed a simple procedure to use the estimated
   dispersivities to determine a priori the maximum gridblock size that
   will maintain an equivalent level of dispersion between fine-scale
   models and upscaled coarse models. Large gridblock sizes can be used for
   highly heterogeneous and layered reservoir models. Nonuniform coarsening
   (upscaling) methods were also recommended and validated for reservoir
   models with sets of sequential but different permeability distributions.
   The procedure was extended to multicontact miscible simulations. The
   sweep and recovery from upscaled multicontact miscible simulations were
   comparable with those of fine-scale models.}},

Abstract = {{Recent surfactant-flooding experiments have shown that very-efficient
   oil recovery can be obtained without mobility control when the
   surfactant solution is injected at less than the critical velocity
   required for a gravity-stable displacement. The purpose of this study
   was to develop a method to predict the stability of surfactant floods at
   the reservoir scale on the basis of gravity-stable surfactant-flooding
   experiments at the laboratory scale. The scaleup process involves
   calculation of the appropriate average frontal velocity for the
   reservoir flood. The frontal velocity depends on the well configuration.
   We have performed systematic numerical simulations to study the effect
   of key scaling groups on the performance of gravity-stable surfactant
   floods. We simulated 3D heterogeneous reservoirs by use of a fine grid
   and a third-order finite-difference method to ensure numerical accuracy.
   These simulations have provided new insight into the behavior of
   gravity-stable surfactant floods, and in particular the importance of
   the microemulsion properties. The capability to predict when and under
   what reservoir conditions a gravity-stable surfactant flood can be
   performed at a reasonable velocity is highly significant. When a
   surfactant flood can be performed without polymer (or foam) for mobility
   control, cost and complexity are significantly reduced. Advantages are
   especially significant when the reservoir temperature is high and the
   use of polymer becomes increasingly difficult. Our simulations show that
   gravity-stable surfactant floods can be very efficient using horizontal
   wells in reservoirs with high vertical permeability.}},

Title = {{Application of Multiple-Mixing-Cell Method To Improve Speed and

Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{565-578}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Standard equation-of-state-based phase equilibrium modeling in reservoir
   simulators involves computationally intensive and time-consuming
   iterative calculations for stability analysis and flash calculations.
   Therefore, speeding up stability analysis and flash calculations and
   improving robustness of the calculations are of utmost importance in
   compositional reservoir simulation.
   Prior knowledge of the tie-lines traversed by the solution of a
   gas-injection problem translates into valuable information with
   significant implications for speed and robustness of reservoir
   simulators. The solution of actual-gas-injection processes follows a
   very complex route because of dispersion, pressure variations, and
   multidimensional flow. The multiple-mixing-cell (MMC) method, originally
   developed to calculate minimum miscibility pressure of a gas-injection
   process, accounts for various levels of mixing of the injected gas and
   initial oil. This observation suggests that the MMC tie-lines developed
   upon repeated contacts may represent a significant fraction of the
   actual simulation tie-lines encountered. We investigate this idea and
   use three tie-line-based K-value-simulation methods for application of
   MMC tie-lines in reservoir simulation. In two of the tie-line-based
   K-value-simulation methods, we examine tabulation and interpolation of
   MMC tie-lines in a framework similar to the compositional-space
   adaptive-tabulation (CSAT) method. In the third method, we perform
   K-value simulations based on inverse-distance interpolation of K-values
   from MMC tie-lines.
   We demonstrate that for the displacements examined, the MMC tie-lines
   are sufficiently close to the actual simulation tie-lines and provide
   excellent coverage of the simulation compositional route. The MMC-based
   methods are then compared with the computational time by use of other
   methods of phase-equilibrium calculations, including a modified
   application of CSAT (an adaptive tie-line-based K-value simulation), a
   method using only heuristic techniques, and the standard method in an
   implicit-pressure/ explicit-concentration-type reservoir simulator. The
   results show that tabulation and interpolation of MMC tie-lines
   significantly improve phase equilibrium and computational time compared
   with the standard approach, with acceptable accuracy.
   The results also show that computational performance of the MMC-based
   methods with only prior tie-line tables is very close to that of CSAT,
   which requires flash calculations during simulation. The K-value
   simulations by use of MMC-based tie-line-interpolation methods improve
   the total computational time up to 51\% in the cases studied, with
   acceptable accuracy. The results suggest that MMC tie-lines represent a
   significant fraction of the actual tie-lines during simulation and can
   be used to significantly improve speed and robustness of
   phase-equilibrium calculations in reservoir simulators.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the time-use patterns of adults in dual-earner
   households with and without children as a function of several individual
   and household socio-demographics and employment characteristics. A
   disaggregate activity purpose classification including both in-home and
   out-of-home activity pursuits is used because of the travel demand
   relevance of out-of-home pursuits, as well as to examine both
   mobility-related and general time-use related social exclusion and time
   poverty issues. The study uses the Nested Multiple Discrete Continuous
   Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model, which recognizes that time-decisions
   entail the choice of participating in one or more activity purposes
   along with the amount of time to invest in each chosen activity purpose,
   and allows generic correlation structures to account for common
   unobserved factors that might impact the choice of multiple
   alternatives. The 2010 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data is used for
   the empirical analysis. A major finding of the study is that the
   presence of a child in dual-earner households not only leads to a
   reduction in in-home non-work activity participation (excluding child
   care activities) but also a substantially larger decrease in out-of-home
   non-work activity participation (excluding child care and shopping
   activities), suggesting a higher level of mobility-related social
   exclusion relative to overall time-use social exclusion. To summarize,
   the results in the paper underscore the importance of considering
   household structure in activity-based travel demand models, as well as
   re-designing work policies in the United States to facilitate a
   reduction in work-family conflict in dual-earner families. (C) 2015

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework is a new
   infrastructure for rapidly instantiating Basic Linear Algebra
   Subprograms (BLAS) functionality. Its fundamental innovation is that
   virtually all computation within level-2 (matrix-vector) and level-3
   (matrix-matrix) BLAS operations can be expressed and optimized in terms
   of very simple kernels. While others have had similar insights, BLIS
   reduces the necessary kernels to what we believe is the simplest set
   that still supports the high performance that the computational science
   community demands. Higher-level framework code is generalized and
   implemented in ISO C99 so that it can be reused and/or reparameterized
   for different operations (and different architectures) with little to no
   modification. Inserting high-performance kernels into the framework
   facilitates the immediate optimization of any BLAS-like operations which
   are cast in terms of these kernels, and thus the framework acts as a
   productivity multiplier. Users of BLAS-dependent applications are given
   a choice of using the traditional Fortran-77 BLAS interface, a
   generalized C interface, or any other higher level interface that builds
   upon this latter API. Preliminary performance of level-2 and level-3
   operations is observed to be competitive with two mature open source
   libraries (OpenBLAS and ATLAS) as well as an established commercial
   product (Intel MKL).}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring the progression of the vascular structure and cerebral blood
   flow (CBF) after brain injury is vital to understand the neurovascular
   recovery process. Multiexposure speckle imaging (MESI) provides a
   quantitatively accurate technique for chronically measuring the
   postocclusion CBF perfusion of the infarct and pen-infarct regions in
   rodent stroke models, while multiphoton microscopy offers direct
   visualization of the microvascular structure. In this paper, we present
   imaging outcomes extending 35 days after photo-thrombotic occlusion,
   tracking the progression of the vasculature throughout this period. We
   compare MESI flow estimates within the unresolvable parenchyma with
   subsurface microvascular volume fractions taken with two-photon
   microscopy in the same regions to assess how the vascular density
   influences the surface-integrated MESI flow values. The MESI flow
   measurements and volume fractions are shown to have high correlations
   (r=0.90) within areas of recovering vasculature in the pen-infarct
   region. We also observe vascular reorientation occurring within the
   microvascular structure throughout the 35-day postocclusion period. With
   the combination of a chronic mouse model and relatively noninvasive
   optical imaging techniques, we present an imaging protocol for
   monitoring long-term vascular progression after photo-thrombotic
   occlusion with the potential to test the efficacy of rehabilitation and
   pharmacological therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Multistream heat exchangers (MHEXs), typically of the plate-fin or

   processes. Equation-oriented modeling of MHEXs for flowsheet
   optimization purposes is challenging, especially when streams undergo
   phase transformations. Boolean variables are typically used to capture
   the effect of phase changes, adding considerable difficulty to solving
   the flowsheet optimization problem. A novel optimization-oriented MHEX
   modeling approach that uses a pseudo-transient approach to rapidly
   compute stream temperatures without requiring Boolean variables is
   presented. The model also computes an approximate required heat exchange
   area to determine the optimal tradeoff between operating and capital
   expenses. Subsequently, this model is seamlessly integrated in a
   previously-introduced pseudo-transient process modeling and flowsheet
   optimization framework. Our developments are illustrated with two
   optimal design case studies, an MHEX representative of air separation
   operation and a natural gas liquefaction process. (c) 2015 American

Abstract = {{A model for gas transport in microfractures of shale and tight gas
   reservoirs is established. Slip flow and Knudsen diffusion are coupled
   together to describe general gas transport mechanisms, which include
   continuous flow, slip flow, transitional flow, and Knudsen diffusion.
   The ratios of the intermolecular collision frequency and the
   molecule-wall collision frequency to the total collision frequency are
   defined as the weight coefficients of slip flow and Knudsen diffusion,
   respectively. The model is validated by molecular simulation results.
   The results show that: (1) the model can reasonably describe the process
   of the mass transform of different gas transport mechanisms; (2)
   fracture geometry significantly impacts gas transport. Under the same
   fracture aperture, the higher the aspect ratio is, the stronger the gas
   transport capacity, and this phenomenon is more pronounced in the cases

Abstract = {{In the past decade, high performance stretchable sensors have found many
   exciting applications including epidermal and in vivo monitors,
   minimally invasive surgical tools, as well as deployable structure
   health monitors (SHM). Although wafer based electronics are known to be
   rigid and planar, recent advances in manufacture and mechanics have made
   intrinsically stiff and brittle inorganic electronic materials
   stretchable and compliant. This review article summarizes the most
   recent mechanics studies on stretchable sensors composed of ceramic and
   metallic functional materials. The discussion will focus around the most
   popular ``island plus serpentine{''} design where active electronic or
   sensing components are housed on an array of isolated, micro-scale
   islands which are interconnected by electrically conductive,
   stretchable, serpentine thin films. The mechanics of polymer supported
   islands, freestanding serpentines, and polymer supported serpentines
   will be introduced. The effects of feature geometry and polymer
   substrate on the stretchability, compliance, as well as functionality of
   the sensor system will be discussed in details. The tradeoff between
   mechanics and functionality gives rise to the challenge of
   simultaneously optimizing the structure and performance of stretchable
   sensors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dependable sensor data are vital in complex systems, which rely on a
   suite of sensors for control as well as condition monitoring. With any
   unanticipated deviations in sensor values, the challenge is to determine
   if the anomalies are the result of one or more flawed sensors or if it
   is indicative of a potentially more serious system-level fault. This
   paper describes a methodology using Bayesian networks to distinguish
   between sensor and process faults as well as faults involving multiple
   sensors or processes. A review of existing methodologies is presented
   first, followed by a description of the sensor/process fault detection
   and isolation (SPFDI) algorithm, its limitations and corresponding
   mitigating strategies. Discussions are also provided on the potential
   for false alarms and real-time updates of the system model based on
   validated sensor data. Factors that affect the algorithm such as the
   effect of network structure, sensor characteristics, effect of
   discretization, etc., are discussed. This is followed by details of
   implementation of the algorithm on an electromechanical actuator (EMA)
   test bed.}},

Title = {{Model development and evaluation of methane potential from anaerobic
   co-digestion of municipal wastewater sludge and un-dewatered grease trap
   waste}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{53-62}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The performance of anaerobic co-digestion of municipal wastewater sludge
   with un-dewatered grease trap waste was assessed using modified
   biochemical methane potential tests under mesophilic conditions (35
   degrees C). Methane potentials, process inhibition and chemical behavior
   of the process were analyzed at different grease trap waste feed ratios
   on volatile solids basis. Nonlinear regression analyses of first order
   reaction and modified Gompertz equations were performed to assist in
   interpretation of the experimental results. Methane potential of
   un-dewatered grease trap waste was measured as 606 mL CH4/g VSadded,
   while methane potential of municipal wastewater sludge was only 223 mL
   CH4/g VSadded. The results indicated that anaerobic digestion of grease
   trap waste without dewatering yields less methane potential than
   concentrated/dewatered grease trap waste because of high wastewater
   content of un-dewatered grease trap waste. However, anaerobic
   co-digestion of municipal wastewater sludge and grease trap waste still
   yields over two times more methane potential and approximately 10\% more
   volatile solids reduction than digestion of municipal wastewater sludge
   alone. The anaerobic co-digestion process inhibitions were reported at
   70\% and greater concentrated/dewatered grease trap waste additions on
   volatile solids basis in previous studies; however, no inhibition was
   observed at 100\% un-dewatered grease trap waste digestion in the
   present study. These results indicate that anaerobic co-digestion of
   un-dewatered grease trap waste may reduce the inhibition risk compared
   to anaerobic co-digestion of concentrated/dewatered grease trap waste.
   In addition, a mathematical model was developed in this study for the
   first time to describe the relationship between grease trap waste feed
   ratio on volatile solids basis and resulting methane potential.
   Experimental data from the current study as well as previous biochemical
   methane potential studies were successfully fit to this relationship and
   allowed estimation of key performance parameters that provide additional
   insight into the factors affecting biochemical methane potential. (C)

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Periprocedural anticoagulation management with uninterrupted
   warfarin and a ``therapeutic{''} international normalized ratio is the
   best approach for reducing both thromboembolic and bleeding
   complications in the setting of catheter ablation for atrial
   fibrillation (AF).
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and
   feasibility of uninterrupted apixaban in this setting.
   METHODS This was a prospective multicenter registry of AF patients
   undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation at 4 institutions in United
   States and Europe with uninterrupted apixaban. These patients were
   compared with an equal number of patients, matched for age, gender, and
   type of AF, undergoing AF ablation on uninterrupted warfarin. The
   apixaban group was comprised of consecutive patients who had taken their
   last dose of apixaban the morning of the procedure. A subset of 29
   patients in the apixaban group underwent diffusion magnetic resonance
   imaging (dMRI) to detect silent cerebral ischemia.
   RESULTS A total of 400 patients (200 patients in each group) were
   included in the study. The average age was 65.9 7 9.9 years, 286
   (71.5\%) were male, and 334 (83.5\%) had nonparoxysmal AF. There were no
   statistical differences with regard to major complications (1\% vs
   0.5\%, P = 1), minor complications (3.5\% vs 2.5\%, P =.56), or total
   bleeding complications (4.5\% vs 3\%, P =.43) between the apixaban and
   warfarin groups. There were no symptomatic thromboembolic complications.
   All dMRIs were negative for ``new{''} silent cerebral ischemia in the
   apixaban group.
   CONCLUSION Uninterrupted apixaban administration in patients undergoing
   AF ablation seems to be feasible and effective in preventing clinical
   and silent thromboembolic events without increasing the risk of major
   bleeding.}},

Abstract = {{The history of infections and epidemics holds famous examples where
   understanding, containing, and ultimately treating an outbreak began
   with understanding its mode of spread. Influenza, HIV, and most computer
   viruses spread person to person, device to device, and through contact
   networks; Cholera, Cancer, and seasonal allergies, on the other hand, do
   not. In this paper, we study two fundamental questions of detection.
   First, given a snapshot view of a (perhaps vanishingly small) fraction
   of those infected, under what conditions is an epidemic spreading via
   contact (e.g., Influenza), distinguishable from a random illness
   operating independently of any contact network (e.g., seasonal
   allergies)? Second, if we do have an epidemic, under what conditions is
   it possible to determine which network of interactions is the main cause
   of the spread-the causative network-without any knowledge of the
   epidemic, other than the identity of a minuscule subsample of infected
   nodes? The core, therefore, of this paper, is to obtain an understanding
   of the diagnostic power of network information. We derive sufficient
   conditions that networks must satisfy for these problems to be
   identifiable, and produce efficient, highly scalable algorithms that
   solve these problems. We show that the identifiability condition we give
   is fairly mild, and in particular, is satisfied by two common graph
   topologies: the d-dimensional grid, and the Erdos-Renyi graphs.}},

Abstract = {{We propose new greedy algorithms for learning the structure of a
   graphical model of a probability distribution, given samples drawn from
   the distribution. While structure learning of graphical models is a
   widely studied problem with several existing methods, greedy approaches
   remain attractive due to their low computational cost. The most natural
   greedy algorithm would be one which, essentially, adds neighbors to a
   node in sequence until stopping; it would do this for each node. While
   it is fast, simple and parallel, this naive greedy algorithm has the
   tendency to add non-neighbors that show high correlations with the given
   node. Our new algorithms overcome this problem in three different ways.
   The recursive greedy algorithm iteratively recovers the neighbors by
   running the greedy algorithm in an inner loop, but each time only adding
   the last added node to the neighborhood set. The second forward-backward
   greedy algorithm includes a node deletion step in each iteration that
   allows non-neighbors to be removed from the neighborhood set which may
   have been added in the previous steps. Finally, the greedy algorithm
   with pruning runs the greedy algorithm until completion and then removes
   all the incorrect neighbors. We provide both analytical guarantees and
   empirical performance for our algorithms. We show that in graphical
   models with strong non-neighbor interactions, our greedy algorithms can
   correctly recover the graph, whereas the previous greedy and convex
   optimization-based algorithms do not succeed.}},

Abstract = {{Electrically conducting polymers (CPs) have been recognized as novel
   biomaterials that can electrically communicate with biological systems.
   For their tissue engineering applications, CPs have been modified to
   promote cell adhesion for improved interactions between biomaterials and
   cells/tissues. Conventional approaches to improve cell adhesion involve
   the surface modification of CPs with biomolecules, such as physical
   adsorption of cell adhesive proteins and polycationic polymers, or their
   chemical immobilization; however, these approaches require additional
   multiple modification steps with expensive biomolecules. In this study,
   as a simple and effective alternative to such additional biomolecule
   treatment, we synthesized amine-functionalized polypyrrole (APPy) that
   inherently presents cell adhesion-supporting positive charges under
   physiological conditions. The synthesized APPy provides electrical
   activity in a moderate range and a hydrophilic surface compared to
   regular polypyrrole (PPy) homopolymers. Under both serum and serum-free
   conditions, APPy exhibited superior attachment of human dermal
   fibroblasts and Schwann cells compared to PPy homopolymer controls.
   Moreover, Schwann cell adhesion onto the APPy copolymer was at least
   similar to that on poly-l-lysine treated PPy controls. Our results
   indicate that amine-functionalized CP substrates will be useful to
   achieve good cell adhesion and potentially electrically stimulate
   various cells. In addition, amine functionality present on CPs can
   further serve as a novel and flexible platform to chemically tether
   various bioactive molecules, such as growth factors, antibodies, and
   chemical drugs. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part

   Cracking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most fatigue cracking models in use have been developed using the
   ordinary least squares (OLS) method. However, fatigue cracking data (or
   any type of cracking data) consists of censored data since it has a
   lower limit of zero. This can cause bias in the fatigue cracking model
   because the data is not continuous but has positive probability mass at
   zero. Additionally, when data is selected only from pavements that
   exhibit cracking, bias will result because the estimates are based on a
   nonrandom sample. Moreover, bias can also be generated by unobserved
   factors not included in the fatigue cracking model. This type of bias
   can be removed by considering the deterioration history of each pavement
   section, if the unobserved factors are section-specific. Based on a
   long-term pavement performance (LTPP) dataset consisting of SPS-1
   pavement sections, the authors have modeled fatigue cracking of pavement
   structures. The data were initially used in modeling fatigue cracking by
   means of OLS and by a corner solution regression model (Tobit) that
   accounts for data censoring in fatigue cracking. The Tobit model was
   used, analyzing the data as pooled and also as a panel dataset (by
   random-effects), to check for possible bias in the model due to
   unobserved heterogeneity. The OLS fatigue cracking model exhibits
   several types of biases due to heterogeneity and erroneous assumptions
   in the modeling process. The model estimates and test statistics used to
   evaluate them indicated that the preferred fatigue cracking model was
   the random effects Tobit model because it accounts for the censoring and
   heterogeneity bias. Estimating the model by accounting for these types
   of bias in the data resulted in significant changes in the effects of
   different parameters affecting fatigue through time. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Current biomedical imaging tools have limitations in accurate assessment
   of the severity of open and deep burn wounds involving excess bleeding
   and severe tissue damage. Furthermore, sophisticated imaging techniques
   are needed for advanced therapeutic approaches such as noninvasive
   monitoring of stem cells seeded and applied in a biomedical 3D scaffold
   to enhance wound repair. This work introduces a novel application of
   combined ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging to assess both
   burn injury and skin tissue regeneration. Tissue structural damage and
   bleeding throughout the epidermis and dermis till the subcutaneous skin
   layer were imaged noninvasively by US/PA imaging. Gold
   nanoparticle-labeled adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) within a
   PEGylated fibrin 3D gel were implanted in a rat model of cutaneous burn
   injury. ASCs were successfully tracked till 2 weeks and were
   distinguished from host tissue components (e.g., epidermis, fat, and
   blood vessels) through spectroscopic PA imaging. The structure and
   function of blood vessels (vessel density and perfusion) in the wound
   bed undergoing skin tissue regeneration were monitored both
   qualitatively and semi-quantitatively by the developed imaging approach.
   Imaging-based analysis demonstrated ASC localization in the top layer of
   skin and a higher density of regenerating blood vessels in the treated
   groups. This was corroborated with histological analysis showing
   localization of fluorescently labeled ASCs and smooth muscle alpha
   actin-positive blood vessels. Overall, the US/PA imaging-based strategy
   coupled with gold nanoparticles has a great potential for stem cell
   therapies and tissue engineering due to its noninvasiveness, safety,
   selectivity, and ability to provide long-term monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Infants with the triad (neurologic dysfunction, subdural hematoma
   {[}SDH], and retinal hemorrhage) are often diagnosed as victims of
   shaken baby syndrome. Medical conditions/predisposing factors to
   developing the triad are often dismissed: short falls, birth-related SDH
   that enlarges, macrocephaly, sinus/cortical vein thrombosis, and others.
   Six infants with the triad are described in which child abuse was
   diagnosed, but parents denied wrongdoing. All 6 had either macrocephaly
   or enlarging head circumference, which suggested medical explanations.
   Three infants incurred short falls, 1 had a difficult delivery in which
   there was likely a rebleed of a birth-related SDH, 1 had a spontaneous
   SDH associated with increased extra-axial fluid spaces, and 1 had a
   sinus thrombosis. Following legal proceedings, all 6 infants were
   returned to their parents, and there has been no child maltreatment in
   follow-up, suggesting child abuse never happened. The results indicate
   that alternative medical explanations for causing the triad should be
   considered and that macrocephaly or an enlarging head circumference
   raises the possibility of a medical explanation.}},

Abstract = {{Gene therapy is the manipulation of gene expression patterns in specific
   cells to treat genetic and pathological diseases. This manipulation is
   accomplished by the controlled introduction of exogenous nucleic acids
   into target cells. Given the size and negative charge of these
   biomacromolecules, the delivery process is driven by the carrier vector,
   of which the usage of viral vectors dominates. Taking into account the
   limitations of viral vectors, nonviral alternatives have gained
   significant attention due to their flexible design, low cytotoxicity and
   immunogenicity, and their gene delivery efficacy. That stated, the field
   of nonviral vectors has been dominated by research dedicated to
   overcoming barriers in gene transfer. Unfortunately, these traditional
   nonviral vectors have failed to completely overcome the barriers
   required for clinical translation and thus, have failed to match the
   delivery outcomes of viral vector. This has consequently encouraged the
   development of new, more radical approaches that have the potential for
   higher clinical translation. In this review, we discuss recent advances
   in vector technology and nucleic acid chemistry that have challenged the
   current understanding of nonviral systems. The diversity of these

Title = {{Wet adhesion of graphene}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{130-140}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Interfacial adhesion between graphene and various substrate materials is
   essential for practical applications of graphene. To date, most of the
   studies on adhesion of graphene have assumed dry adhesion of van der
   Waals type. In this paper, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations to
   study the traction-separation behaviors for wet adhesion of graphene on
   amorphous silicon oxide covered by a thin layer of water. Three stages
   of the traction-separation relations are identified and they are
   analyzed by simple, approximate continuum models. The work of separation
   is found to be close to the theoretical value dictated by the
   interaction potential between graphene and water. The maximum traction
   is found to be set by the critical stress for cavitation at the
   water/graphene interface. With morphological evolution of water from
   cavitation to capillary bridging, the range of interaction extends to
   about 3 nm before complete separation of graphene. Compared to van der
   Waals interactions for dry adhesion of graphene, the work of separation
   for wet adhesion is smaller, the maximum traction is lower, but the
   interaction range is longer. It is noted that the properties of wet
   adhesion depend sensitively on the graphene-water interactions, which
   may vary considerably from hydrophobic to hydrophilic interactions. (C)

Abstract = {{Molecular plasmonics explores and exploits the molecule-plasmon
   interactions on metal nanostructures to harness light at the nanoscale
   for nanophotonic spectroscopy and devices. With the functional molecules
   and polymers that change their structural, electrical, and/or optical
   properties in response to external stimuli such as electric fields and
   light, one can dynamically tune the plasmonic properties for enhanced or
   new applications, leading to a new research area known as active
   molecular plasmonics (AMP). Recent progress in molecular design,
   tailored synthesis, and self-assembly has enabled a variety of scenarios
   of plasmonic tuning for a broad range of AMP applications. Dimension
   (i.e., zero-, two-, and three-dimensional) of the molecules on metal
   nanostructures has proved to be an effective indicator for defining the
   specific scenarios. In this review article, we focus on structuring the
   field of AMP based on the dimension of molecules and discussing the
   state of the art of AMP. Our perspective on the upcoming challenges and
   opportunities in the emerging field of AMP is also included.

   therefore, can be successfully used to reduce the optical scattering of
   a subwavelength object. Three different typologies of nanoparticle
   arrays are analyzed: spherical, core-shell, and ellipsoidal
   nanoparticles. We prove, both theoretically and through full-wave
   simulations, that such nanostructures can be successfully used as a
   cloaking device at ultraviolet and optical frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative but simple analytical modeling tool for reconstructing
   contaminant concentration versus time trends (i.e., ``source
   history{''}) for a site using high-resolution contaminant profiles from
   low permeability (low-k) zones was developed and tested. Migration of
   contaminants into low-k zones via diffusion (and possibly slow
   advection) produce concentration versus depth profiles that can be used
   to understand temporal concentration trends at the interface with
   overlying transmissive zones, including evidence of attenuation over
   time due to source decay. A simple transport-based spreadsheet tool for
   generating source history estimates fit to the profiles was developed
   and applied to published soil concentration versus depth data from five
   distinct areas of four different sites contaminated with chlorinated
   ethenes. Using the root mean square error as an optimization metric,
   strong fits between measured and model-predicted soil data were obtained
   in the majority of cases using site-specific values for input
   parameters. In general, significant improvements could not be obtained
   by varying these parameters. As a result, the source history estimates
   generated by the tool were similar to those that had already been
   generated using more intensive analytical or numerical inverse modeling
   approaches. This included confirmation of constant source histories at
   locations where dense nonaqueous-phase liquid was present (or suspected
   to be present), and declining source histories for locations where
   source isolation and/or attenuation had occurred. The advantage of the
   modeling tool described here is that it provides a simpler yet more
   dynamic method for understanding source behavior over time than existing
   approaches. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy is considered one of the most promising renewable energy
   sources. However, the advancement of wind power generation is impeded by
   major challenges such as the cost of wind power, environmental impacts,
   and effects on power grid stability. One of the major environmental
   challenges hindering public acceptance for new wind power installations
   is the noise emission from wind turbines. Unfortunately, reducing the
   noise emission could lead to decreased wind energy harvesting. As a
   result of these conflicting goals, a tradeoff between power generation
   and noise emission arises.
   An optimal control approach for wind turbines is presented in this
   paper. By controlling the electromagnetic torque of the generator and/
   or the blade pitch angle, an optimal operating condition that considers
   the tradeoff between wind turbine energy harvesting and noise emission
   can be obtained. Simulations were conducted to analyze the impact of the
   control design on power generation and noise emission in partial and
   full-load conditions. Additionally, a case study for a wind farm located
   near a residential area operating in two different wind classes is
   detailed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An immersed structure approach for fluid-vegetation interaction}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We present an immersed structure approach for modeling the interaction
   between surface flows and vegetation. Fluid flow and rigid and flexible
   vegetative obstacles are coupled through a local drag relation that
   conserves momentum. In the presented method, separate meshes are used
   for the fluid domain and vegetative obstacles. Taking techniques from
   immersed boundary finite element methods, the effects of the fluid on
   the vegetative structures and vice versa are calculated using integral
   transforms. Using a simple elastic structure model we incorporate
   bending and moving vegetative obstacles. We model flexible vegetation as
   thin, elastic, inextensible cantilever beams. Using the immersed
   structure approach, a fully coupled fluid-vegetation interaction model
   is developed assuming dynamic fluid flow and quasi-static bending. This
   relatively computationally inexpensive model allows for thousands of
   vegetative obstacles to be included in a simulation without requiring an
   extremely refined fluid mesh. The method is validated with comparisons
   to mean velocity profiles and bent vegetation heights from experiments
   that are reproduced computationally. We test the method on several
   channel flow setups. We calculate the bulk drag coefficient in these
   flow scenarios and analyze their trends with changing model parameters
   including stem population density and flow Reynolds number. Bulk drag
   models are the primary method of incorporating small-scale drag from
   individual plants into a value that can be used in larger-scale models.
   Upscaled bulk drag quantities from this method may be utilized in
   larger-scale simulations of flow through vegetation regions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Presented is a method for establishing the appropriate balance of image

   N-Particle Extended (MCNPX) radiation transport code, the DC Planmeca

   Carestream 6100 RVG sensor signal response, noise response, dose rate

   including uncertainties and inter/intraunit variabilities. The
   computationally varied parameters were peak kilovoltage and tube
   filtration. The entrance air kerma for the current clinical technique
   was used to establish reference image quality. Four figures of merit
   (FOM) were chosen to encompass parameter variation. With equal weighting
   of FOMs and no equipment limitations, the optimal parameters were 90 kVp
   with 0.1 mm added copper filtration. The optimal technique in the
   radiographic units' operating range was 70 kVp and 0.1 mm added copper

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{466-477}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the development of a general framework for building level
   power demand forecasting and its applications to supervisory control and
   demand management are presented. Models of thermal loads, while rigorous
   and insightful, do not directly extrapolate to measures of power
   consumption and cannot be easily applied to a variety of buildings.
   Ultimately, building operators are interested in managing power
   consumption as energy costs and opportunities are directly related to
   the power variable. Our work develops Auto-Regressive models with
   eXogeneous inputs (ARX) to forecast power demand in conjunction with
   existing physics based modeling approaches and enhances the current
   control framework for building energy management. The main contributions
   of this work are identifying and incorporating building level
   measurements as inputs, and evaluating the use of power forecast models
   for supervisory control and demand response (DR). The move towards a
   smarter grid is expected to provide extensive data on building
   conditions and power consumption, which we can include in the model
   development. Options for model inputs and outputs are investigated
   depending on possible measurements, and their effect (or sensitivity) on
   the modeling and decision making processes are evaluated. It is shown
   that an appropriate selection of exogenous inputs related to the control
   action is necessary to capture the effect of common demand management
   practices such as precooling. The forecasting capabilities are also
   demonstrated on a simplified building model and on data collected from a
   real building. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper has studied the open-hole and pin filled-hole effects on the

   production of automotive interior parts. The influence of specimen
   width-to-hole diameter (W/D) ratios of 6, 3, and 2 on failure load was
   studied. Two sample thicknesses of 3 mm and 6 mm were evaluated.
   Mechanical properties of the KPNCs in terms of uniaxial tensile,
   open-hole tensile (OHT), and pin filled-hole tensile (FHT) were measured
   experimentally. A preliminary model by extended finite element method
   (XFEM) was established to predict the failure load and simulate crack
   propagation of 3 mm thick open-hole and pin filled-hole specimens. Good
   agreement was found between experimental and simulation results. By
   calculating the stress concentration factor Kt for brittle materials,
   the net section stress factor Kt, for ductile materials, and the
   strength reduction factor K-r, it was found that KPNC was relatively

Title = {{On understanding the physics of the Enceladus south polar plume via
   numerical simulation}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{253}},
Pages = {{205-222}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Enceladus plume is composed of primarily water vapor and tiny ice
   grains. Various observations suggest that it most likely originates from
   vents along the Tiger Stripes. Consequently, understanding the expansion
   process of the two-phase flow from the vents into vacuum is crucial. Our
   goal is to investigate the important physical processes and the
   interaction between the gas and the grains associated with the expansion
   process. To do so, we compute the expansion flow from the vents out to
   higher altitudes using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method
   with two-way coupling between the gas and the grains. The expansion flow
   passes through multiple regimes, from continuum (very collisional) near
   the vents to free-molecular (collisionless) at higher altitudes. This
   transition occurs at a few kilometers high for meter-sized vents and is
   higher up for larger vents. During expansion, the Mach number increases
   rapidly in the first few vent diameters mainly due to a drop in gas
   temperature rather than an increase in gas speed. Collisions at the vent
   strongly affect the molecular speeds in the far-field (as the flow
   becomes free-molecular). If the flow is sufficiently collisional at the
   vent, the molecular speeds approach the ultimate speed of adiabatic
   expansion, which depends on the source conditions (similar to 1005 m/s
   for the triple-point of water). The flow is highly supersaturated as it
   emerges from the vents, thus condensation grain growth is very likely.
   We find that condensation growth via heterogeneous nucleation above the
   vents is proportional to vent size and that fairly large vents several
   tens to hundreds of meters in size are required to produce the
   micron-sized grains detected by CDA (radii >= 1.6 mu m) if the grains
   start with a negligible size at the vents. We also examine how the
   effects of grains on the gas vary with grain size, grain/gas (ice/vapor)
   mass ratio and gas-grain velocity difference at the vent. The effects of
   grains increase with mass ratio and velocity difference at the vent due
   to greater exchange of momentum and energy. Moreover, smaller grains
   have a stronger effect for the same mass ratio. However, the effects of
   grains are minimal for plausible mass ratios <= 1.0. Our studies show
   that nanometer-sized grains decouple from the gas at altitudes of 10-100
   vent diameters and spread more with the gas while micron-sized grains
   decouple at <10 vent diameters and remain in collimated beams. Even with
   large velocity differences at the vent, the micron-sized grains spread
   by <= 12 degrees. Consequently, the inferred spreading angles >= 30
   degrees (Ingersoll, A.P., Ewald, S.P. {[}2011]. Icarus 216, 492-506;
   Postberg, F. et al. {[}2011]. Nature 474, 620-622) cannot be caused by
   velocity difference at the vent alone. Furthermore, nanometer-sized
   grains are accelerated close to gas speeds while micron-sized grains
   tend to retain the initial speeds they had at the vent. We determine
   that the largest grain size that can be accelerated from rest to escape
   speeds (>240 m/s) is proportional to vent size and that small vents (<1
   m) are enough to accelerate large micron-sized grains to escape speeds.

Abstract = {{A conceptual framework for evaluating the vulnerability of
   industrialized coastal regions to storm surge was developed and
   implemented to evaluate the vulnerability of the Houston Ship Channel
   Industrial Corridor (HSC-IC) in Texas to storm surge. In the study,
   Hurricane Ike scenarios were modeled with SWAN + ADCIRC that involved
   changing the landfall location of the hurricane along the coast and
   incorporating the effect of increased wind speed. The storm surge data
   from the various landfall scenarios were cross-linked with geospatial
   and environmental data associated with facilities within the industrial
   region. This work uniquely combines the potential releases from storage
   tanks, records of past historical releases, and risk management planning
   to characterize environmental vulnerabilities using storage information
   and geospatial data. The resulting framework for vulnerability
   implemented within the HSC-IC found a relationship between storm surge
   and the total area inundated at a given storm surge level and between
   storm surge and the total number of storage tanks. Using the developed
   framework, it was possible to combine releases from storage tanks,
   records of past historical releases, and risk management planning to
   characterize environmental vulnerabilities on a facility by facility
   basis and for the modeled surge levels.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{In the calculation of the reaction curve for grounds reinforced with jet
   grouting umbrellas in tunnels, the jet grouting progressive hardening is
   ignored by assuming mean values for the jet grouting properties. In this
   paper, we present a new procedure that calculates the reaction curve for
   these grounds, considering jet grouting hardening. Tunnel excavation is
   represented in the ground plane-strain analysis by increasing the tunnel
   convergence at a rate obtained from the tunnel longitudinal deformation
   profile. This novelty allows us to perform the analysis at an accurate
   rate, which is critical for jet grouted tunnels. Using this new
   approach, one can estimate a lower bound for convergence of supported
   tunnels and hence an upper bound for pressure on the tunnel supports.
   Using a finite element model, we calculate the ground reaction curves
   for a case study tunnel with and without considering jet grouting
   hardening. The resulting curves illustrate that ignoring the jet
   grouting hardening can lead to an unsafe design of these tunnels. We use
   the ground reaction curve to also estimate the savings in tunnel
   supports due to jet grouting and the efficiency of jet grouting at
   different tunnel advance rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Measuring and modeling the magnetic settling of superparamagnetic

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present settling experiments and mathematical modeling
   to study the magnetic separation of superparamagnetic iron-oxide
   nanoparticles (SPIONs) from a brine. The experiments were performed
   using SPIONs suspensions of concentration between 3 and 202 g/L
   dispersed in water and separated from the liquid under the effect of a
   permanent magnet. A 1D model was developed in the framework of the
   sedimentation theory with a conservation law for SPIONs and a mass flux
   function based on the Newton's law for motion in a magnetic field. The
   model describes both the hindering effect of suspension concentration
   (n) during settling due to particle collisions and the increase in
   settling rate due to the attraction of the SPIONs towards the magnet.
   The flux function was derived from the settling experiments and the
   numerical model validated against the analytical solution and the
   experimental data. Suspensions of SPIONs were of 2.8 cm initial height,
   placed on a magnet, and monitored continuously with a digital camera.
   Applying a magnetic field of 0.5 T of polarization, the SPION's velocity
   was of approximately 3 . 10(-5) m/s close to the magnet and decreases of
   two orders of magnitude across the domain. The process was characterized
   initially by a classical sedimentation behavior, i.e., an upper
   interface between the clear water and the suspension slowly moving
   towards the magnet and a lower interface between the sediment layer and
   the suspension moving away from the magnet. Subsequently, a rapid
   separation of nanoparticle occured suggesting a non-classical settling
   phenomenon induced by magnetic forces which favor particle aggregation
   and therefore faster settling. The rate of settling decreased with n and
   an optimal condition for fast separation was found for an initial n of
   120 g/L. The model agrees well with the measurements in the early stage
   of the settling, but it fails to describe the upper interface movement
   during the later stage, probably because of particle aggregation induced
   by magnetization which is not accounted for in the model. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Sucrose and zinc oxide (ZnO) are effective cement hydration retarders.
   The goal of this study was to provide a new look into the ZnO cement
   hydration mechanism and to investigate impacts of various supplementary
   cementitious materials (SCMs) on retardation behavior of ZnO and
   sucrose. Changes in the pore solution composition and reaction kinetics
   were measured for cementitious systems with ZnO or sucrose that
   contained rice straw ash (RSA), wheat straw ash, silica fume,
   metakaolin, and fly ash. Among the SCMs used, RSA dramatically
   suppressed ZnO and sucrose retardation. Experimental results indicated
   that the mechanism by which ZnO retards hydration reaction could be
   nucleation and/or growth poisoning of C-S-H. Reduced retardation of
   paste samples containing RSA was attributed to the ability of RSA to
   provide nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation. This study provides a
   better understanding of the interaction between SCMs and cement
   hydration retarders essential in predicting retarder-dose effects. (C)

Abstract = {{In this work we present the concept and design of an ultrathin (lambda/
   22) terahertz (THz) unidirectional carpet cloak based on the local phase
   compensation approach enabled by gradient metasurfaces. A triangular
   surface bump with center height of 4.1 mm (1.1 lambda) and tilt angle of
   20 degrees is covered with a metasurface composed of an array of
   suitably designed closed ring resonators with a transverse gradient of
   surface impedance. The ring resonators provide a wide range of control
   for the reflection phase with small absorption losses, enabling
   efficient phase manipulation along the edge of the bump. Our numerical
   results demonstrate a good performance of the designed cloak in both
   near field and far field, and the cloaked object mimics a flat ground
   plane within a broad range of incidence angles, over 35 degrees angular
   spectrum centered at 45 degrees. The presented cloak design can be
   applied in radar and antenna systems as a thin, lightweight, and easy to
   fabricate solution for radio and THz frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{A joint experimental and computational study investigates the
   translocation of a tryptophan molecule through a phospholipid membrane.
   Time dependent spectroscopy of the tryptophan side chain determines the

   detailed simulations are conducted to calculate the free energy profiles
   and the permeation coefficient. Different charging conditions of the
   peptide (positive, negative, or zwitterion) are considered. Both
   experiment and simulation reproduce the qualitative trend and suggest
   that the fastest permeation is when the tryptophan is positively
   charged. The permeation mechanism, which is revealed by molecular
   dynamics simulations, is of a translocation assisted by a local defect.
   The influence of long-range electrostatic interactions, such as the
   membrane dipole potential on the permeation process, is not significant.}},

Abstract = {{Pd-Au bimetallic catalysts have shown promising performance for a number
   of oxidative reactions. The present study utilizes reactive molecular
   beam scattering (RMBS), reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy
   (RAIRS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and density functional
   theory (DFT) techniques in an attempt to enhance the fundamental
   understanding of oxygen activation and reaction with CO on PdAu
   surfaces. Our results reveal that the presence of contiguous Pd sites is
   crucial for adsorption of oxygen molecules on Pd/Au(111) surfaces at 77
   K. Upon heating, oxygen admolecules desorbed molecularly without
   detectable dissociation in O-2-TPD measurements. CO-RMBS experiments
   indicate that at lower temperatures (77-150 K) oxygen admolecules were
   readily displaced by CO due to competitive adsorption. Oxygen
   admolecules can be thermally activated at higher temperatures (180-250
   K) to react with CO to form CO2. DFT calculations show that the PdAu
   surface containing larger Pd ensembles favors dissociative CO oxidation,
   whereas associative CO oxidation and O-2 desorption are the two main
   competing processes for the PdAu surface containing small Pd ensembles.
   An associative CO oxidation pathway was not experimentally observed,
   which is likely due to facile CO-induced O-2 desorption. These results
   provide mechanistic insights into the interaction of oxygen with PdAu
   surfaces, which may prove informative for the rational design of PdAu
   catalysts for associated reactions involving O-2 as a reactant.}},

Abstract = {{The Prussian Blue analog, NaxFeMn(CN)(6), is a potential new cathode
   material for Na-ion batteries. During Na intercalation, the dehydrated
   material exhibits a monoclinic to rhombohedral phase transition, while
   the hydrated material remains in the monoclinic phase. With density
   functional theory calculations, the phase transition is explained in
   terms of a competition between Coulomb attraction, Pauli repulsion, and
   d-pi covalent bonding. The interstitial Na cations have a strong Coulomb
   attraction to the N anions in the host material, which tend to bend the
   Mn-N bonds and reduce the volume of the structure. The presence of
   lattice H2O enhances the Pauli repulsion so that the volume reduction is
   suppressed. The calculated volume change, as it depends upon the
   presence of lattice H2O, is consistent with experimental measurements.
   Additionally, a new LiFeMn(CN)(6) phase is predicted where MnN6
   octahedra decompose into LiN4 and MnN4 edge-sharing tetrahedra.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents microstructural analysis of two original and their
   respective warm mix asphalt (WMA) binders, obtained with the addition of
   Advera((R)) and Sasobit((R)). The binders were analysed before and after
   long-term ageing with the aid of atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM
   images highlighted the effect of ageing using rolling thin film oven
   (RTFO) followed by pressure ageing vessel (PAV) on the binders'
   microstructure. Ageing of original binders generally increased the size
   of the ``bee{''} structures. The ageing effect on the microstructure
   morphology of WMA binders was found to be negligible. However, ageing
   could affect the mechanical properties without morphology variations.
   The high variability inside each sample analysed makes the analysis
   complex. Sasobit((R)) changed the original binders' microstructure
   considerably, while Advera((R)) did not affect it. For the original and
   Advera((R)) binders, 24 hours after sample preparation, the dispersed
   phase expanded, and this effect was generally more pronounced for unaged
   than for aged binders. This could indicate a lower mobility of the
   species forming microstructures in aged samples. The reduced mobility of
   these species during heat treatment also affects the microstructure of
   the samples. A hypothesis on the development of ``bee{''} structures
   starting from dendritic structures was proposed.}},

Title = {{Quantification and simulation of layer-specific mitral valve
   interstitial cells deformation under physiological loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{373}},
Pages = {{26-39}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Within each of the four layers of mitral valve (MV) leaflet tissues
   there resides a heterogeneous population of interstitial cells that
   maintain the structural integrity of the MV tissue via protein
   biosynthesis and enzymatic degradation. There is increasing evidence
   that tissue stress-induced MV interstitial cell (MVIC) deformations can
   have deleterious effects on their biosynthetic states that are
   potentially related to the reduction of tissue-level maintenance and to
   subsequent organ-level failure. To better understand the
   interrelationships between tissue-level loading and cellular responses,
   we developed the following integrated experimental-computational
   approach. Since in vivo cellular deformations are not directly
   measurable, we quantified the in-situ layer-specific MVIC deformations
   for each of the four layers under a controlled biaxial tension loading
   device coupled to multi-photon microscopy. Next, we explored the
   interrelationship between the MVIC stiffness and deformation to
   layer-specific tissue mechanical and structural properties using a
   macro-micro finite element computational model. Experimental results
   indicated that the MVICs in the fibrosa and ventricularis layers
   deformed significantly more than those in the atrialis and spongiosa
   layers, reaching a nucleus aspect ratio of 3.3 under an estimated
   maximum physiological tension of 150 N/m. The simulated MVIC moduli for
   the four layers were found to be all within a narrow range of 4.71-5.35
   kPa, suggesting that MVIC deformation is primarily controlled by each
   tissue layer's respective structure and mechanical behavior rather than
   the intrinsic MVIC stiffness. This novel result further suggests that
   while the MVICs may be phenotypically and biomechanically similar
   throughout the leaflet, they experience layer-specific mechanical
   stimulatory inputs due to distinct extracellular matrix architecture and
   mechanical behaviors of the four MV leaflet tissue layers. This also
   suggests that MVICs may behave in a layer-specific manner in response to
   mechanical stimuli in both normal and surgically modified MVs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Increasing attention is being given to developing quantitative measures
   of facial expression. This study used quantitative facial expression
   analysis to examine associations between smiling intensity and
   psychosocial functioning in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC).
   Smiling intensity of 95 HNC patients was measured using 48 quantitative
   measures calculated from facial photographs with and without a smile. We
   computed a composite smiling intensity score for each patient
   representing the degree of similarity to healthy controls. A lower
   composite score indicates that the person is less expressive, on
   average, than healthy controls. Patients also completed self-report
   measures assessing domains of body image and quality of life (QOL).
   Spearman rank correlations were computed to examine relationships
   between composite scores and psychosocial functioning. Composite scores
   were significantly correlated with multiple measures of body image and
   QOL. Specifically, decreased smiling intensity was associated with
   feelings of dissatisfaction with one's body, perceived negative social
   impact of body image, increased use of avoidance as a body image-coping
   strategy, reduced functional well-being, and greater head and neck
   cancer-specific issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study to demonstrate associations between an objectively quantified
   facial expression (i.e. smiling) and psychosocial functioning. Most
   previous studies have measured facial expression qualitatively. These
   findings indicate that smiling intensity may serve as an important
   clinical indicator of psychosocial well-being and warrants further
   clinical investigation.}},

Abstract = {{By using silver nanoplatelets with a widely tunable localized surface
   plasmon resonance (LSPR), and their corresponding local field
   enhancement, here we show large manipulation of plasmonic enhanced
   upconversion in NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals at the single particle
   level. In particular, we show that when the plasmonic resonance of
   silver nanolplatelets is tuned to 656 nm, matching the emission
   wavelength, an upconversion enhancement factor similar to 5 is obtained.
   However, when the plasmonic resonance is tuned to 980 nm, matching the
   nanocrystal absorption wavelength, we achieve an enhancement factor of
   similar to 22 folds. The precise geometric arrangement between
   fluorescent nanoparticles and silver nanoplatelets allows us to make,
   for the first time, a comparative analysis between experimental results
   and numerical simulations, yielding a quantitative agreement at the
   single particle level. Such a comparison lays the foundations for a
   rational design of hybrid metal-fluorescent nanocrystals to harness the
   upconversion enhancement for biosensing and light harvesting
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Concentration-gradient layered
   Li{[}Ni0.8Co0.2](0.7){[}Ni0.2Mn0.8](0.3)O-2 oxide with Ni-rich in the
   core and Mn-rich in the surface region has been synthesized through a
   condition-controlled tank reactor reaction. While the Ni-rich core
   facilitates high capacity, the Mn-rich surface enables good cyclability
   and thermal stability. The concentration-gradient sample exhibits a
   higher capacity of 204 mA h g(-1) at C/5 rate with superior cyclability
   and thermal stability compared to the constant-concentration
   LiNi0.62Co0.14Mn0.24O2 sample, which has the same net Ni, Co, and Mn
   contents as those present in the concentration-gradient sample. The
   concentration-gradient sample was also coated with a thin layer of Al2O3
   on the surface to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface and
   thereby further improve the electrochemical performance. Both the
   Structural (gradient structure) and surface (Al2O3 coating)
   modifications help suppress side reactions between electrode and
   electrolyte and reduce the decline in voltage during cycling. The
   Al2O3-coated concentration-gradient sample exhibits improved long-term

Title = {{A coupled ordinates method for solution acceleration of rarefied gas
   dynamics simulations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{96-115}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Non-equilibrium rarefied flows are frequently encountered in a wide
   range of applications, including atmospheric re-entry vehicles, vacuum
   technology, and microscale devices. Rarefied flows at the microscale can
   be effectively modeled using the ellipsoidal statistical
   Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (ESBGK) form of the Boltzmann kinetic equation.
   Numerical solutions of these equations are often based on the finite
   volume method (FVM) in physical space and the discrete ordinates method
   in velocity space. However, existing solvers use a sequential solution
   procedure wherein the velocity distribution functions are implicitly
   coupled in physical space, but are solved sequentially in velocity
   space. This leads to explicit coupling of the distribution function
   values in velocity space and slows down convergence in systems with low
   Knudsen numbers. Furthermore, this also makes it difficult to solve
   multiscale problems or problems in which there is a large range of
   Knudsen numbers. In this paper, we extend the coupled ordinates method
   (COMET), previously developed to study participating radiative heat
   transfer, to solve the ESBGK equations. In this method, at each cell in
   the physical domain, distribution function values for all velocity
   ordinates are solved simultaneously. This coupled solution is used as a
   relaxation sweep in a geometric multigrid method in the spatial domain.
   Enhancements to COMET to account for the non-linearity of the ESBGK
   equations, as well as the coupled implementation of boundary conditions,
   are presented. The methodology works well with arbitrary convex
   polyhedral meshes, and is shown to give significantly faster solutions
   than the conventional sequential solution procedure. Acceleration
   factors of 5-9 are obtained for low to moderate Knudsen numbers on
   single processor platforms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave sheath-Voltage combination Plasma (MVP) is a high density
   plasma source and can be used as a suitable plasma processing device
   (e.g., ionized physical vapor deposition). In the present report, the
   spatio-temporal behavior of an argon MVP sustained along a
   direct-current biased Ti rod is investigated. Two plasma modes are
   observed, one is an ``oxidized state{''} (OS) at the early time of the
   microwave plasma and the other is ``ionized sputter state{''} (ISS) at
   the later times. Transition of the plasma from OS to ISS results a
   prominent change in the visible color of the plasma, resulting from a
   significant increase in the plasma density, as measured by a Langmuir
   probe. In the OS, plasma is dominated by Ar ions, and the density is in
   amplitude order of 10(11) cm(-3). In the ISS, metal ions from the Ti rod
   contribute significantly to the ion composition, and higher density
   plasma (10(12) cm(-3)) is produced. Nearly uniform high density plasma
   along the length of the Ti rod is produced at very low input microwave
   powers (around 30 W). Optical emission spectroscopy measurements confirm
   the presence of sputtered Ti ions and Ti neutrals in the ISS. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Transition-meta phosphates (TMPs) are potential materials for
   large-scale applications of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Yet,
   high-voltage TMP cathodes have not met commercial success due to ill
   understood failure mechanisms. In this article we studied the surface
   chemistry of Li3V2(PO4)(3) composite electrodes using X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) post-electrochemical cycling in a
   stable electrochemical window of 3.0-4.2, V vs Li/Li+ and in the wider
   window of 3.0-4.8 V vs Li/Li+ where a dramatic fade in capacity is
   noted. In addition, we performed aging experiments in LiPF6 EC/DEC
   electrolyte with no electrochemical bias applied to investigate a
   possible Spontaneous solid electrolyte interphase (SET) formation as has
   been described for lithium transition-metal oxide (LixMyOz) electrodes.
   An SEI was found on the Li3V2(PO4)(3) composite electrodes cycled in
   both potential windows and after aging with similar chemical
   compositions including ethers, alkoxides, esters, carboxylates, and
   carbonates as well as decomposed salt products. Analogous experiments
   were performed on the individual constituents of the composite
   electrode,(active material) binder, and carbon additive). It was
   determined that the carbon additive and not Li3V2(PO4)(3) formed an SEI
   both spontaneously and electrochemically. Therefore, the carbon additive
   and its properties are crucial in the formation of the SEI on TMP
   cathodes for LIBs which directly affect its lithium intercalation
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Sequential phase transitions were investigated in detail for a Set of
   newly designed poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene
   oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide),(PPO-PEO-PPO) triblock copolymers, where
   the PPO blocks have isotactic, (R)- or (S)-, or atactic configurations.
   Microphase separation and thermal composition fluctuations were studied
   near the order disorder transition temperature (133 +/- 1 degrees C),
   and the interaction parameters chi(T) were determined. A unique feature
   of these materials is the cooperative and sequential nature of phase
   transitions, which leads to the inversion Of the crystallization/melting
   sequence of PEO and isotactic PPO blocks. The PEO blocks crystallize
   quickly (ca. 50 degrees C) within a soft, confined lamellar template,
   which is followed by slow crystallization of the isotactic PPO blocks
   (ca. 40 degrees C) under hard confinement. However, in :the melting
   process, PEO crystals melt first (ca. 60 degrees C) affording soft
   confinement which enables isotactic PPO crystals to undergo
   recrystallization and lamellar thickening. This cooperative behavior
   allows the PPO crystals to survive at higher temperatures (68 degrees
   C). The c-axes of PEO and isotactic PPO crystal lattices are both found
   perpendicular to the lamellar planes. We believe this study provides
   insight into the fundamental interrelationship between microphase
   separation and confined crystallization that can Occur in
   semicrystalline materials capable of self-assembly across multiple
   length scales:}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Microwave (mw) breakdown of atmospheric pressure microgaps is studied by
   a one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Collisions numerical
   model. The effect of both field electron emission and secondary electron
   emission (due to electron impact, ion impact, and primary electron
   reflection) from surfaces on the breakdown process is considered. For
   conditions where field emission is the dominant electron emission
   mechanism from the electrode surfaces, it is found that the breakdown
   voltage of mw microdischarge coincides with the breakdown voltage of
   direct-current (dc) microdischarge. When microdischarge properties are
   controlled by both field and secondary electron emission, breakdown
   voltage of mw microdischarge exceeds that of dc microdischarge. When
   microdischarge is controlled only by secondary electron emission,
   breakdown voltage of mw microdischarge is smaller than that of dc
   microdischarge. It is shown that if the interelectrode gap exceeds some
   critical value, mw microdischarge can be ignited only by electrons
   initially seeded within the gap volume. In addition, the influence of
   electron reflection and secondary emission due to electron impact is
   studied. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   search}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{In covalent mechanochemistry, precise application of mechanical stress
   to molecules of interest ({''}mechanophores{''}) is used to induce to
   promote desired reaction pathways. Computational prediction of such
   phenomena and rational mechanophore design involves the computationally
   costly task of finding relevant transition-state saddles on
   force-deformed molecular potential energy surfaces (PESs). Finding a
   transition state often requires an initial guess about the pathway by
   which the reaction will proceed. Unfortunately, chemical intuition often
   fails when predicting likely consequences of mechanical stress applied
   to molecular systems. Here, we describe a fully deterministic method for
   finding mechanochemically relevant transition states and reaction
   pathways. The method is based on the observation that application of a
   sufficiently high mechanical force will eventually destabilize any
   molecular structure. Mathematically, such destabilization proceeds via a
   ``catastrophe{''} occurring at a critical force where the energy minimum
   corresponding to the stable molecular structure coalesces with a
   transition state. Catastrophe theory predicts the force-deformed PES to
   have universal behavior in the vicinity of the critical force, allowing
   us to deduce the molecular structure of the transition state just below
   the critical force analytically. We then use the previously developed
   method of tracking transition-state evolution with the force to map out
   the entire reaction path and to predict the complete force dependence of
   the reaction barrier. Beyond its applications in mechanochemistry, this
   approach may be useful as a general method of finding transition states
   using fictitious forces to target specific reaction mechanisms. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We present a systematic analysis of the accuracy of five different
   methods for extracting the biomechanical properties of soft samples
   using optical coherence elastography (OCE). OCE is an emerging
   noninvasive technique, which allows assessment of biomechanical
   properties of tissues with micrometer spatial resolution. However, in
   order to accurately extract biomechanical properties from OCE
   measurements, application of a proper mechanical model is required. In
   this study, we utilize tissue-mimicking phantoms with controlled elastic
   properties and investigate the feasibilities of four available methods
   for reconstructing elasticity (Young's modulus) based on OCE
   measurements of an air-pulse induced elastic wave. The approaches are
   based on the shear wave equation (SWE), the surface wave equation
   (SuWE), Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equation (RLFE), and finite element
   method (FEM), Elasticity values were compared with uniaxial mechanical
   testing. The results show that the RLFE and the FEM are more robust in
   quantitatively assessing elasticity than the other simplified models.
   This study provides a foundation and reference for reconstructing the
   biomechanical properties of tissues from OCE data, which is important
   for the further development of noninvasive elastography methods.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of sulfite (SO32-) oxidation during nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
   absorption into sulfite solutions were measured using a high-gas-flow
   sparging apparatus. SO32- absorbs NO2 via a free-radical mechanism that
   produces a sulfite radical (SO3 center dot-) and nitrite. The radical
   then catalyzes SO32- oxidation to form sulfate. Free-radical scavengers
   such as thiosulfate can be added to suppress radical concentrations and
   inhibit sulfite oxidation. The effects of thiosulfate, sulfite, NO2
   absorption, temperature, and dioxygen (O-2) partial pressure on sulfite
   oxidation were investigated under sodium hydroxide (NaOH) scrubbing
   conditions. Oxidation is inverse half-order in thiosulfate, first-order
   in sulfite, and half-order in absorbed NO2. Sulfite oxidation shows
   little dependence on O-2 partial pressures above 5 kPa but has a strong
   dependence on O-2 at lower partial pressures. Oxidation from 20 to 65
   degrees C was fit using the Arrhenius equation with an activation energy
   of 24.1 kJ/mol. The addition of 0.01 mM iron increased oxidation rates
   by a factor of 3 compared to solutions with 0.01 mM
   ethylenediarninetetraacetic acid added to chelate trace metals. A
   standard NaOH scrubber would need approximately 50 mM thiosulfate in the
   circulating solvent to maintain 10 mM SO32- while removing 100 ppm of
   SO2 and 2.5 ppm of NO2.}},

Abstract = {{Batteries with high energy and power densities along with long cycle
   life and acceptable safety at an affordable cost are critical for
   large-scale applications such as electric vehicles and smart grids, but
   is challenging. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are attractive in this
   regard due to their high energy density and the abundance of sulfur, but
   several hurdles such as poor cycle life and inferior sulfur utilization
   need to be overcome for them to be commercially viable. Li-S cells with
   high capacity and long cycle life with a dual-confined flexible cathode
   configuration by encapsulating sulfur in nitrogen-doped double-shelled
   hollow carbon spheres followed by graphene wrapping are presented here.
   Sulfur/polysulfides are effectively immobilized in the cathode through
   physical confinement by the hollow spheres with porous shells and
   graphene wrapping as well as chemical binding between heteronitrogen
   atoms and polysulfides. This rationally designed free-standing
   nanostructured sulfur cathode provides a well-built 3D carbon conductive
   network without requiring binders, enabling a high initial discharge
   capacity of 1360 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of C/5, excellent rate
   capability of 600 mA h g(-1) at 2 C rate, and sustainable cycling
   stability for 200 cycles with nearly 100\% Coulombic efficiency,
   suggesting its great promise for advanced Li-S batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is generally attributed to the
   progressive vascular accumulation of lipoproteins and circulating
   monocytes in the vessel walls leading to the formation of
   atherosclerotic plaques. This is known to be regulated by the local
   vascular geometry, haemodynamics and biophysical conditions. Here, an
   isogeometric analysis framework is proposed to analyse the blood flow
   and vascular deposition of circulating nanoparticles (NPs) into the
   superficial femoral artery (SFA) of a PAD patient. The local geometry of
   the blood vessel and the haemodynamic conditions are derived from
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed at baseline and at 24 months
   post intervention. A dramatic improvement in blood flow dynamics is
   observed post intervention. A 500\% increase in peak flow rate is
   measured in vivo as a consequence of luminal enlargement. Furthermore,
   blood flow simulations reveal a 32\% drop in the mean oscillatory shear
   index, indicating reduced disturbed flow post intervention. The same
   patient information (vascular geometry and blood flow) is used to
   predict in silico in a simulation of the vascular deposition of
   systemically injected nanomedicines. NPs, targeted to inflammatory
   vascular molecules including VCAM-1, E-selectin and ICAM-1, are
   predicted to preferentially accumulate near the stenosis in the baseline
   configuration, with VCAM-1 providing the highest accumulation (approx.
   1.33 and 1.50 times higher concentration than that of ICAM-1 and
   E-selectin, respectively). Such selective deposition of NPs within the
   stenosis could be effectively used for the detection and treatment of
   plaques forming in the SFA. The presented MRI-based computational
   protocol can be used to analyse data from clinical trials to explore
   possible correlations between haemodynamics and disease progression in
   PAD patients, and potentially predict disease occurrence as well as the
   outcome of an intervention.}},

   incorporates social work students and faculty to infuse strategies for
   community engagement in designing and implementing student-led global
   engineering development projects. We outline how this interdisciplinary
   pedagogical approach teaches students from the two disciplines to work
   together in addressing power balances, economic and social issues and

Abstract = {{Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) convergence can be accelerated by
   providing an initial feasible solution from static traffic assignment
   (STA). While this strategy seems natural, it has received little
   attention in the literature despite a number of choices which must be
   made, including STA stopping criteria, determining STA demand from
   dynamic demand, how to create a path-based DTA solution from the STA
   solution and the choice of STA algorithm itself. This paper studies
   these variations in the context of a cell-transmission based DTA
   algorithm. Experimental results on two networks of different size
   indicate that the STA solution can provide significant improvements in
   convergence despite the time-varying and flow model differences. A
   sensitivity analysis provides evidence that these benefits to
   convergence are likely to persist over varying inputs. The analysis
   further suggests that although the optimal parameter choice depends on
   the network, practitioners will observe significant improvements in
   convergence for a fairly wide range of reasonable parameters.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{A classifier-guided sampling (CGS) method is introduced for solving
   engineering design optimization problems with discrete and/or continuous
   variables and continuous and/or discontinuous responses. The method
   merges concepts from metamodel-guided sampling and population-based
   optimization algorithms. The CGS method uses a Bayesian network
   classifier for predicting the performance of new designs based on a set
   of known observations or training points. Unlike most metamodelling
   techniques, however, the classifier assigns a categorical class label to
   a new design, rather than predicting the resulting response in
   continuous space, and thereby accommodates non-differentiable and
   discontinuous functions of discrete or categorical variables. The CGS
   method uses these classifiers to guide a population-based sampling
   process towards combinations of discrete and/or continuous variable
   values with a high probability of yielding preferred performance.
   Accordingly, the CGS method is appropriate for discrete/discontinuous
   design problems that are ill suited for conventional metamodelling
   techniques and too computationally expensive to be solved by
   population-based algorithms alone. The rates of convergence and
   computational properties of the CGS method are investigated when applied
   to a set of discrete variable optimization problems. Results show that
   the CGS method significantly improves the rate of convergence towards
   known global optima, on average, compared with genetic algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to show how the results of an optimisation
   model that can be integrated with the decisions made within a simulation
   model to schedule back-end operations in a semiconductor assembly and
   test facility. The problem is defined by a set of resources that
   includes machines and tooling, process plans for each product and the
   following four hierarchical objectives: minimise the weighted sum of key
   device shortages, maximise weighted throughput, minimise the number of
   machines used and minimise the makespan for a given set of lots in
   queue. A mixed integer programming model is purposed and first solved
   with a greedy randomised adaptive search procedure (GRASP). The results
   associated with the prescribed facility configuration are then fed to
   the simulation model written in AutoSched AP. However, due to the
   inadequacy of the options built into AutoSched, three new rules were
   created: the first two are designed to capture the machine set-up
   profiles provided by the GRASP and the third to prioritise the
   processing of hot lots containing key devices. The computational
   analysis showed that incorporating the set-up from the GRASP in dynamic
   operations of the simulation greatly improved its performance with
   respect to the four objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) is being considered for use at the
   10-nm technology node and below for routing layers with pitches down to
   similar to 50 nm because it has better line edge roughness and overlay
   control compared to other multiple patterning candidates. To date, most
   of the SADP-related literature has focused on enabling SADP-legal
   routing in physical design tools while few attempts have been made to
   address the impact SADP routing has on local, standard cell (SC) I/O pin
   access. At the same time, via layers are used to connect the local SADP
   routing layers to the I/O pins on lower metal layers. Due to the high
   via density on the Via-1 layer, the litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE)-aware
   Via-1 design becomes a necessity to achieve legal pin access at the SC
   level. In this paper, we present the first study on SADP-aware pin
   access and layout optimization at the SC level. Accounting for
   SADP-specific and Via-1 design rules, we propose a coherent framework
   that uses depth first search, mixed integer linear programming, and
   backtracking method to enable LELE friendly Via-1 design and
   simultaneously optimize SADP-based local pin access and within-cell
   connections. Our experimental results show that, compared with the
   conventional approach, our framework effectively improves pin access of
   the SCs and maximizes the pin access flexibility for routing.}},

Abstract = {{Renewed interest in Mesozoic exploration, onshore and offshore, in the
   Gulf of Mexico (GOM) has precipitated a new look at Mesozoic
   biostratigraphy and how these age-diagnostic bioevents can help to
   establish a sequence-stratigraphic framework for the basin. We have
   developed a new chronostratigraphic framework, primarily founded on
   biostratigraphic age-diagnostic data, specifically developed for
   Mesozoic strata of the GOM basin. Our goal was to provide a systematic
   and consistent framework that serves as a reference for the order and
   timing of depositional sequences and key surfaces in the GOM Mesozoic
   stratigraphic section. The new chronostratigraphic framework was based
   on (1) our work delineating significant physical stratigraphic surfaces
   from seismic and well-log data in the GOM, (2) Mesozoic biostratigraphic
   data from 202 onshore and offshore wells in the GOM, and (3) published
   literature from the GOM and other studies. The chronostratigraphic
   framework was formalized in an online Mesozoic biostratigraphy table and
   summarized in a Mesozoic stratigraphy chart. The use of the framework
   was key to our ability to correlate within the GOM basin, and we
   evaluated several examples of seismic and well-log interpretation using
   the new chronostratigraphic framework, including onshore-offshore
   correlation, identification and correlation of source rocks, and
   interpretation of structural anomalies. These examples illustrated how
   the chronostratigraphic framework enabled us to reduce uncertainty in
   identifying and correlating Mesozoic units from land to the deepwater
   GOM basin. The framework also allowed us to better compare our work with
   other research groups, within academia and industry, and permitted a
   higher level of integration of work and comments from various applied
   industry workers.}},

Title = {{Determination of drilling fluid rheology under downhole conditions by
   using real-time distributed pressure data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{One the most important tasks during any drilling operation is to measure
   rheological properties of drilling fluids to allow for optimum
   maintenance and wellbore hydraulics management. In current drilling
   practice, such measurement is routinely carried out by a mud engineer at
   the rig site using test protocols and equipment that quantify the
   relationship between the fluid's shear stress and shear rate, as
   standardized by the American Petroleum Institute (API). Usually,
   measurements are conducted at atmospheric pressure and standardized
   temperature and are therefore generally not representative of actual
   downhole pressure and temperature conditions. High Pressure High
   Temperature (HPHT) viscometers can of course be used at the drilling
   fluid design stage to determine its rheological properties under
   downhole condition. However, these properties are subjected to change
   during drilling operations due to variation in mud maintenance and the
   introduction of drilling solids and contaminations. In addition,
   installation of a HPHT viscometer at the rig site is highly impractical
   due to its cost, maintenance, calibration difficulties, and lack of
   dedicated personnel to run the equipment.
   This paper presents a novel method to determine mud rheological
   parameters in real-time by using downhole sensor data. The well itself
   is used as the equivalent of a large pipe viscometer, with pressure
   measurements conducted along its length using multiple sensors placed at
   strategic positions in the drillstring. Contrary to traditional methods,
   rheology determination is performed at actual downhole pressure and
   temperature, without any human interaction and without the need for any
   rheology measurement equipment on surface. Frictional pressure loss is
   recorded at several flow rates, preferably while ramping up pump rates
   after making connections, and parameters associated with two- and
   three-parameter rheological models (e.g. the n, K and tau(y) parameters
   of the Yield Power Law (YPL) also known as Herschel-Bulkley model, which
   most accurately describes the majority of drilling fluids) are derived.
   In addition, time-dependent fluid characteristics such as gel strength
   can also be quantified using this method. Pressure data sets from wired
   drillpipe during field trials with a 12.6 ppg and 13.1 ppg synthetic
   based muds were used to validate the applicability of the new method in
   the field. These validations show that the method can be applied
   successfully in the field when downhole distributed pressure data is
   available.
   This novel approach represents a significant step in the direction of
   achieving full automation of drilling fluid property monitoring and
   maintenance with an elegant method that requires no human interaction,
   eliminating the need for surface measurement equipment, while at the
   same time representing more accurately the downhole pressure and
   temperature environment. Given the importance of accurate rheology
   characterization, particularly in the new era of active annular pressure
   management using Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and Dual Gradient
   Drilling (DGD) techniques that rely heavily on accurate hydraulics
   modeling, the benefits are self-evident. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An envelope-tracking (ET) algorithm is presented for efficiently solving
   integral equations pertinent to the analysis of transient scattering
   from perfect electrically conducting surfaces. The algorithm solves
   space-time samples of the complex envelope of the surface current
   density by implicit time marching; thus, the time-step size is inversely
   proportional to the bandwidth-not the maximum frequency content-of the
   fields of interest. At each time step, anterpolation, propagation,
   interpolation, and near-zone correction stages are performed to compute
   the right-hand side of a matrix equation, which involves 4-D space-time
   FFTs, and to accelerate its iterative solution, which involves 3-D space
   FFTs. These FFTs dominate the computational costs of the method: they
   require O(N-C{[}log(2) N-g + (N) over bar (I) log N-C]) operations per
   time step; here, NC is the number of nodes on an auxiliary regular grid,
   Ng is determined by the number of time steps that fields take to travel
   the maximum distance between two points on the scattering surface, and
   (N) over barI is the average number of iterations needed for the
   iterative solution to converge at each time step. Moreover, the
   algorithm is systematically compared to its time-and frequency-domain
   counterparts. To this end, radar profiles of benchmark targets are
   computed, a time-domain dB-error norm is proposed, the algorithms'
   parameters are optimized subject to at most 2\% error in the radar
   profile according to this norm, and the computational costs are
   measured, as target size, shape, and excitation pulse are varied. The
   results show that the algorithm outperforms its time-domain counterpart
   and is competitive with its frequency-domain counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a nonparametric matched filter-bank spectrum
   estimator, referred to as the forward and backward (FB) amplitude and
   phase estimation (FBAPES) method, to perform dispersion analysis of
   borehole array sonic measurements. Different from conventional
   dispersion analysis methods, the amplitude and phase estimation method
   estimates the dispersive properties of wave modes by simulating the
   statistical character of interferences from noise and other modes taking
   place at the same frequency, designing an adaptive filter to suppress
   these interferences, and fitting the filter output to a spatial sinusoid
   with a designated slowness. Such an adaptive filter with low side-lobe
   response gives rise to a high-resolution fitness function, with clear
   and narrow ridges, which significantly facilitates identification of
   different modes. At each frequency, for a data set with a moderate noise
   level, slowness of all modes hidden in the recorded waveforms can be
   identified without prior knowledge of the exact number of wave modes. We
   apply an FB method to improve the robustness of the estimation. We used
   synthetic and field examples to verify the advantages of the method over
   the weighted spectral semblance and extended matrix pencil methods.
   Resolution and noise analyses confirmed the high stability and
   resolution performance of the FBAPES method.}},

Abstract = {{Identification and petrophysical evaluation of thinly bedded formations
   with borehole resistivity measurements can be problematic due to the
   large volume of investigation of the measurements.
   Logging-while-drilling (LWD) Sigma logs can overcome this difficulty
   because Sigma measurements have a smaller volume of investigation. Sigma
   is the macroscopic absorption nuclear cross section of a material that
   quantifies the material's ability to absorb thermal neutrons. The
   contrast in Sigma between salty formation water and hydrocarbons makes
   Sigma logs useful for resistivity-independent estimation of water
   saturation. We assumed LWD Sigma measurements acquired with one near
   thermal-neutron detector (near), one short-spaced gamma-ray detector
   (SSn), and one long-spaced gamma-ray detector (LSn). Separation of
   multidetector Sigma logs may indicate the presence of mud-filtrate
   invasion in the case of thick formations. However, Sigma measurements
   acquired in thinly bedded formations are affected not only by invasion,
   but also by shoulder beds such that the separation between logs with
   different radial lengths of investigation will not necessarily be due to
   mud-filtrate invasion. We have developed an inversion-based
   interpretation method of LWD Sigma measurements to estimate 2D formation
   properties with reduced invasion and shoulder-bed effects. We tested
   this method with two synthetic and two field cases. Results indicated
   that the 2D inversion-based interpretation method improved the
   calculation of water saturation from Sigma logs sustaining environmental
   and geometric effects. Conventional interpretation of Sigma logs can
   lead to overestimation of water saturation by as much as 50\% resulting
   from shoulder-bed effects in uninvaded formations and by as much as
   100\% in depth zones simultaneously affected by invasion, shoulder beds,
   and well deviation.}},

   Therapy Combination for Severe Major Depressive Disorder}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Phototherapy, ie, bright light therapy, is an effective and
   safe treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). It exerts rapid
   mood-elevating activity, similar to antidepressant medications, most
   likely mediated through both monoaminergic and circadian system
   melatonergic mechanisms. We assessed the efficiency of bright light
   therapy as an adjuvant treatment to antidepressant pharmacotherapy in
   patients with severe MDD randomized by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
   (HDRS) score to either (1) 150 mg venlafaxine hydrochloride daily at 7:
   00 am or (2) 150 mg venlafaxine plus 60-minute light of 7000 lux the
   initial week of clinical management (venlafaxine + bright light therapy)
   daily at 7: 00 am.
   Method: 50 inpatients with severe MDD at the Psychiatry Clinic of
   Yuzuncu Yil University Training and Education Hospital participated. The
   study, which was conducted from January 2013 through June 2014, entailed
   patients diagnosed with severe MDD based on DSM-IV-TR for the first
   time. Mood states were assessed by the HDRS, Profile of Mood States
   (POMS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before treatment and at 1,
   2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment.
   Results: On the basis of the HDRS score as the primary outcome variable,
   both strategies significantly improved depression and negative mood
   states already at the first treatment week (P < .001). Differences in
   therapeutic effects by treatment strategy were remarkable at the second
   and fourth weeks of clinical management (P = .018 and P = .011,
   respectively), with beneficial effects continuing until trial
   Conclusion. Those treated with venlafaxine + bright light therapy
   evidenced significantly lower HDRS depression scores (P < .05) as well
   as BDI scores (P < .05) and POMS negative mood states scores
   (depression-dejection, tension-anxiety, anger-hostility,
   fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment subscales; all P < .05)
   after the second week. At week 4 of the trial, 19 (76\%) of the 25
   venlafaxine + bright light therapy patients versus just 11 (44\%) of the
   25 venlafaxine patients (P < .05) attained the target goal of treatment,
   a HDRS score = 13, indicative of mild depression, and, although not
   statistically significant in our small sample study (P = .36), at week
   8, 76\% of venlafaxine + bright light therapy patients (n = 19) versus
   just 64\% of the venlafaxine patients (n = 16) experienced complete
   remission of depression (HDRS score = 7). Conclusions: Both venlafaxine
   and venlafaxine + bright light therapy treatment strategies
   significantly reversed the depressive mood of patients with severe MDD;
   however, the latter induced significantly stronger and more rapid
   beneficial effects. Future longer-term studies with large sample sizes,
   nonetheless, are required to confirm and generalize these results to
   patients of diverse ethnicities and cultures with both severe and mild
   MDD. (C) Copyright 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{River deltas form where sediment-laden water debouches into a basin. The
   spatial delineation of a delta is nontrivial and yet is fundamental to
   systematically evaluating fluxes across its surface. Here we study
   shoreline dynamics of the Wax Lake Delta (WLD), a naturally developing
   delta, downstream of the Atchafalaya River, USA. We demonstrate the
   ability to extract hydrodynamic and morphodynamic shorelines from time
   series of satellite imagery and topography data, respectively. The
   hydrodynamic shoreline corresponds to the traditional dry-wet interface,
   whereas we introduce the concept of a morphodynamic shoreline
   demarcating the topset-foreset transition of a delta to quantitatively
   express the degree of inundation of a delta plain. These shorelines
   enable us to assess environmental controls on inundation of the WLD
   delta plain, noting the abundance of satellite imagery, whereas time
   series of bathymetric data from delta plains are scarce. From the
   analysis of NOAA and U.S. Geological Survey environmental data, we
   identify the effects of river discharge, tides, wind, and vegetation on
   shoreline position. In particular, using Delft3D simulations and a
   simplified momentum balance, we highlight the nonuniform and nonlinear
   effect of wind on delta plain inundation. Our analyses reveal that wind,
   riverine discharge, and tides significantly contribute to inundation of
   the WLD, and hence, incorporating their interaction is essential to the
   accurate modeling of hydrodynamics and ecodynamics of the WLD delta
   plain, as well as to the dynamic shape of delta plains in general.

Title = {{A Best Practice in Static Modeling of a Coalbed-Methane Field: An

Abstract = {{The development of a coalbed-methane (CBM) field in its early stage is
   often plagued by the lack of well control and the scarcity of geological
   data across a large geographical area. Therefore, constructing a
   representative static model to estimate the in-place volume presents a
   formidable challenge. In this paper, we propose a work flow to overcome
   this challenge and apply it to a CBM field in the northern Bowen basin
   of Australia. One may consider this work flow as a best practice for the
   following reasons. First, it makes use of data from various sources
   including cores, well logs, seismic interpretation, and topography.
   Second, it performs rigorous quality control on these data, such as
   depth shift and log normalization. Third, coal-ply division and
   correlation and subsequent structural modeling are based on three types
   of correlation: well-to-well, well-to-seismic, and
   well-seismic-geographic information system. Fourth, it establishes the
   low, base, and high trends for the most-important reservoir properties.
   Fifth, it constructs a base-case static model by combining the
   aforementioned structural and reservoir-property models. Sixth, it uses
   sensitivity analysis, which varies one reservoir parameter at a time, to
   rank the impact of reservoir parameters on in-place volume. Seventh, it
   uses uncertainty analysis that varies all reservoir parameters
   simultaneously to arrive at the P10, P50, and P90 inplace volumes and
   their corresponding static models that one can use for reservoir
   simulations to estimate the recoverable volumes.}},

Title = {{Simulation of Polymer Injection Under Fracturing Conditions-An
   Injectivity Pilot in the Matzen Field, Austria}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Polymer flooding leads to enhanced oil recovery by accelerating oil
   production and improving sweep efficiency. However, because of the
   higher viscosity, the injectivity of polymer solutions is of some
   concern and is important to understand to predict incremental oil
   recoveries. Achieving high polymer-injection rates is required to
   increase oil-production rates.
   In the field test performed in the Matzen field (Austria),
   polyacrylamide polymers were injected for the past 2 years. Coreflood
   experiments with these polymers showed a significant increase in
   apparent viscosity because of the viscoelastic properties of the polymer
   solutions. Also, severe degradation of the polymer solution at high flow
   velocities was detected. In addition to coreflood experiments, flow
   experiments through fractures were performed. In these experiments,
   shear thinning and limited degradation of the polymer solution were
   observed and quantified.
   Detailed polymer-injection simulations were conducted that included
   complex polymer rheology in the fractures and the matrix. The reservoir
   stress changes and their effects on the fractures were also taken into
   account as a result of cold-polymer injection. The results of the
   simulations matched the field data both for waterfloods and polymer-test
   floods.
   The simulations revealed two distinct phases during the injection of the
   polyacrylamide-polymer solution:
   1. Injection under matrix conditions in an early phase resulting in
   severe degradation of the polymers
   2. Injection under fracturing conditions after the formation parting
   pressure is reached, leading to limited degradation of the polymers
   The calibrated model was used to investigate the impact of polymer
   rheology and particle plugging on injectivity and fracture growth.
   The results of the field test and the simulations indicate that
   screening of fields for polyacrylamide-polymer projects needs to include
   geomechanical properties of the reservoir sand and cap/base rock in
   addition to the conventional parameters used in screening such as oil
   viscosity, water salinity, reservoir temperature, and reservoir
   permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Pentacene (C22H14), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, was used as both
   supporting and sacrificing layers for the clean and doping-free graphene
   transfer. After successful transfer of graphene to a target substrate,
   the pentacene layer was physically removed from the graphene surface by
   using intercalating organic solvent. This solvent-mediated removal of
   pentacene from graphene surface was investigated by both theoretical
   calculation and experimental studies with various solvents. The uses of
   pentacene and appropriate intercalation solvent enabled graphene
   transfer without forming a residue from the supporting layer. Such
   residues tend to cause charged impurity scattering and unintentional
   graphene doping effects. As a result, this clean graphene exhibited
   extremely homogeneous surface potential profiles over a large area. A
   field-effect transistor fabricated using this graphene displayed a high
   hole (electron) mobility of 8050 cm(2)N.s (9940 cm(2)N.s) with a nearly
   zero Dirac point voltage.}},

Title = {{Reexamination of basal plane thermal conductivity of suspended graphene
   samples measured by electro-thermal micro-bridge methods}},
Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Thermal transport in suspended graphene samples has been measured in
   prior works and this work with the use of a suspended electro-thermal
   micro-bridge method. These measurement results are analyzed here to
   evaluate and eliminate the errors caused by the extrinsic thermal
   contact resistance. It is noted that the room-temperature thermal
   resistance measured in a recent work increases linearly with the
   suspended length of the single-layer graphene samples synthesized by
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and that such a feature does not reveal
   the failure of Fourier's law despite the increase in the reported
   apparent thermal conductivity with length. The re-analyzed apparent
   thermal conductivity of a single-layer CVD graphene sample reaches about
   1680 +/- 180 W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature, which is close to the
   highest value reported for highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. In
   comparison, the apparent thermal conductivity values measured for two
   suspended exfoliated bi-layer graphene samples are about 880 +/- 60 and
   730 +/- 60 Wm(-1) K-1 at room temperature, and approach that of the
   natural graphite source above room temperature. However, the
   low-temperature thermal conductivities of these suspended graphene
   samples are still considerably lower than the graphite values, with the
   peak thermal conductivities shifted to much higher temperatures.
   Analysis of the thermal conductivity data reveals that the low
   temperature behavior is dominated by phonon scattering by polymer
   residue instead of by the lateral boundary. (C) 2015 Author(s). All

Abstract = {{A probabilistic seismic hazard analysis has been conducted for a
   potential nuclear power plant site on the coast of South Africa, a
   country of low-to-moderate seismicity. The hazard study was conducted as
   a SSHAC Level 3 process, the first application of this approach outside
   North America. Extensive geological investigations identified five fault
   sources with a non-zero probability of being seismogenic. Five area
   sources were defined for distributed seismicity, the least active being
   the host zone for which the low recurrence rates for earthquakes were
   substantiated through investigations of historical seismicity. Empirical
   ground-motion prediction equations were adjusted to a horizon within the
   bedrock at the site using kappa values inferred from weak-motion
   analyses. These adjusted models were then scaled to create new equations
   capturing the range of epistemic uncertainty in this region with no
   strong motion recordings. Surface motions were obtained by convolving
   the bedrock motions with site amplification functions calculated using
   measured shear-wave velocity profiles.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a displacement-based seismic design procedure is
   presented for reinforced masonry shear-wall structures, with the
   objective of being more consistent, transparent, and practical than
   current force-based seismic design procedures. The procedure anticipates
   the formation of a plastic mechanism at specified target displacements,
   calculates the local deformation demands associated with that mechanism,
   and ensures that those local deformation demands remain below
   deformation capacities for flexure-dominated and shear-dominated wall
   segments. Guidelines to determine the target displacements and effective
   damping properties for reinforced masonry wall structures are provided.
   The proposed procedure and guidelines are used in a trial application to
   design a full-scale, two-story reinforced masonry shear-wall system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a comprehensive validation of a displacement-based
   seismic design procedure proposed in a companion paper for reinforced
   masonry shear-wall structures. For this purpose, a full-scale, two-story
   reinforced masonry specimen was tested on a shake table to examine the
   global and local behaviors of a low-rise reinforced masonry building
   designed by the proposed displacement-based procedure, and to validate
   the analytical tool used in the design process. This specimen
   successfully resisted repeated ground motions with intensities up to the
   maximum considered earthquake (MCE). Its performance on the shake-table
   demonstrates that a reinforced masonry structure designed, detailed, and
   constructed according to the proposed displacement-based design
   procedure can resist MCE earthquakes without collapse even though it may
   suffer severe damage. In critical regions of this specimen, elements
   detailed in accordance with displacement-based requirements showed more
   inelastic deformation capacity than the deformation limits imposed by
   the displacement-based design provisions proposed here. The proposed
   procedure produces structures that behave according to design
   expectations, even though severely damaged.}},

Abstract = {{Leaky waves have been among the most active areas of research in
   microwave engineering over the second half of the 20th century. They
   have been shown to dominate the near-field of several open wave-guiding
   structures, of great interest to tailor their radiation, guidance and
   filtering properties. The elegant theoretical analyses and deep physical
   in-sights in this area, developed in an era in which computational
   resources were limited, represent a fundamental scientific legacy that
   is still extremely relevant in today's engineering society and beyond.
   In this regard, the relevance of leaky-wave concepts has been
   increasingly recognized in recent times over a broader scientific
   community, including optics and physics societies. In this paper, after
   revisiting the fundamental concepts of leaky-wave theory, we discuss and
   connect different relevant research activities in which leaky-wave
   concepts have been applied, with the goal of facilitating
   multidisciplinary interactions on these topics. In addition to the
   canonical microwave applications of leaky waves, particular attention is
   devoted to a few areas of interest in modern optics, such as directive
   optical antennas, extraordinary optical transmission, and embedded
   scattering eigenvalues, in which leaky waves play a fundamental role.}},

Title = {{A Theoretical and Experimental Approach for Correlating Nanoparticle
   Structure and Electrocatalytic Activity}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1351-1357}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the research described in this Account is the
   development of high-throughput computational-based screening methods for
   discovery of catalyst candidates and subsequent experimental validation
   using appropriate catalytic nanoparticles. Dendrimer-encapsulated
   nanoparticles (DENs), which are well-defined 1-2 nm diameter metal
   nanoparticles, fulfill the role of model electrocatalysts.
   Effective comparison of theory and experiment requires that the
   theoretical and experimental models map onto one another perfectly. We
   use novel synthetic methods, advanced characterization techniques, and
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations to approach this ideal. For
   example, well-defined core@shell DENs can be synthesized by
   electrochemical underpotential deposition (UPD), and the observed
   deposition potentials can be compared to those calculated by DFT. Theory
   is also used to learn more about structure than can be determined by
   analytical characterization alone. For example, density functional
   theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) was used to show that the core@shell
   configuration of Au@Pt DENs undergoes a surface reconstruction that
   dramatically affects its electrocatalytic properties. A separate Pd@Pt
   DENs study also revealed reorganization, in this case a core-shell
   inversion to a Pt@Pd structure. Understanding these types of structural
   changes is critical to building correlations between structure and
   catalytic function.
   Indeed, the second principal focus of the work described here is
   correlating structure and catalytic function through the combined use of
   theory and experiment. For example, the Au@Pt DENs system described
   earlier is used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as well as for
   the electro-oxidation of formic acid. The surface reorganization
   predicted by theory enhances our understanding of the catalytic
   measurements. In the case of formic acid oxidation, the deformed
   nanoparticle structure leads to reduced CO binding energy and therefore
   improved oxidation activity. The final catalytic study we present is an
   instance of theory correctly predicting (in advance of the experiments)
   the structure of an effective DEN electrocatalyst. Specifically, DFT was
   used to determine the optimal composition of the alloy-core in AuPd@Pt
   DENs for the ORR. This prediction was subsequently confirmed
   experimentally. This study highlights the major theme of our research:
   the progression of using theory to rationalize experimental results to
   the more advanced goal of using theory to predict catalyst function a
   priori. We still have a long way to go before Theory will be the
   principal means of catalyst discovery, but this Account begins to shed
   some light on the path that may lead in that direction.}},

Abstract = {{Interplanetary and intermoon tour missions have benefited from the
   implementation of leveraging maneuvers that efficiently change
   spacecraft energy relative to a flyby body. In the current work, these
   v(infinity) leveraging maneuvers are generalized and reformulated into a
   boundary-value problem suitable for broad trajectory searches using only
   one additional continuous degree of freedom. The presented method
   naturally incorporates noncircular orbits and arbitrary ephemeris
   locations for bodies as well as leveraging maneuvers between different
   bodies. These advantages come from using the same boundary conditions as
   the Lambert problem, which also maintains the Lambert-based outer-loop
   search architecture used in many trajectory design tools. The general
   maneuver formulation of the presented method allows it to be used for
   interplanetary or intermoon trajectories and allows the incorporation of
   nontangent leveraging transfers. Some examples of the new formulation's
   utility are also explored using representative transfers; these examples
   present some of the families of leveraging solutions and show that
   bielliptic transfers are a special case of interbody leveraging.}},

Abstract = {{The orbit determination process, such as that used for the Gravity
   Recovery and Climate Experiment, known as GRACE, is highly dependent
   upon the comparison of measured observables with computed values,
   derived from mathematical models relating the satellites' numerically
   integrated state to the observable. Significant errors in the computed
   state corrupt this comparison and induce errors in the least-squares
   estimate of the satellites' states, as well as the gravity field. Due to
   the high accuracy of the intersatellite ranging measurements from GRACE,
   numerical computations must mitigate errors to maintain a similar level
   of accuracy. One error source is the presence of roundoff errors in the
   computed intersatellite range-rate when integrating continuous, smoothly
   varying accelerations with double-precision arithmetic. These errors
   occur at approximately 8pm/s root mean square and limit the accuracy of
   numerically integrating background gravity field models to
   degrees/orders 260 and 410 for satellite pairs flying at altitudes of
   500 and 300km respectively. In addition, the integration of filtered,
   transient accelerations, which occur on timescales much smaller than the
   integration step size, induce errors at an approximately 10nm/s in
   range-rate, becoming a limitation as more advanced intersatellite
   measurement techniques approach this level of accuracy.}},

Pages = {{236-250}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Patent classification systems and citation networks are used extensively
   in innovation studies. However, non-unique mapping of classification
   codes onto specific products/markets and the difficulties in accurately
   capturing knowledge flows based just on citation linkages present
   limitations to these conventional patent analysis approaches. We present
   a natural language processing based hierarchical technique that enables
   the automatic identification and classification of patent datasets into
   technology areas and sub-areas. The key novelty of our technique is to
   use topic modeling to map patents to probability distributions over real
   world categories/topics. Accuracy and usefulness of our technique are
   tested on a dataset of 10,201 patents in solar photovoltaics filed in
   the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 2002 and
   2013. We show that linguistic features from topic models can be used to
   effectively identify the main technology area that a patent's invention
   applies to. Our computational experiments support the view that the
   topic distribution of a patent offers a reduced-form representation of
   the knowledge content in a patent. Accordingly, we suggest that this
   hidden thematic structure in patents can be useful in studies of the
   policy-innovation-geography nexus. To that end, we also demonstrate an
   application of our technique for identifying patterns in technological
   convergence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In many reinforced concrete frame structures designed before issues
   related to progressive collapse became important, it was common to have
   discontinuous positive reinforcement through a column. To provide
   toughness to such frames under dynamic loading, which may be generated
   due to sudden loss of a gravity support, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer
   (CFRP) materials can be installed on the bottom face or side faces of a
   reinforced concrete (RC) beam parallel to discontinuous longitudinal
   reinforcement. Behavior of rehabilitated RC beams was studied
   experimentally under dynamic loading, in which CFRP materials were used
   to provide continuity to the discontinuous reinforcement. Different
   levels of dynamic peiformance were observed depending on the details of
   application of CFRP materials. The test results indicated that anchored
   CFRP sheets successfully provided continuity to the positive
   reinforcement under dynamic loading so that plastic rotation capacity of
   the beams was realized. In addition, it was possible to develop fracture
   of the CFRP sheets after delamination using CFRP anchors and/or CFRP
   U-wraps.}},

Abstract = {{We present an optimized secure multi-antenna transmission approach based
   on artificial-noise-aided beamforming, with limited feedback from a
   desired single-antenna receiver. To deal with beamformer quantization
   errors as well as unknown eavesdropper channel characteristics, our
   approach is aimed at maximizing throughput under dual performance
   constraints-a connection outage constraint on the desired communication
   channel and a secrecy outage constraint to guard against eavesdropping.
   We propose an adaptive transmission strategy that judiciously selects
   the wiretap coding parameters, as well as the power allocation between
   the artificial noise and the information signal. This optimized solution
   reveals several important differences with respect to solutions designed
   previously under the assumption of perfect feedback. We also investigate
   the problem of how to most efficiently utilize the feedback bits. The
   simulation results indicate that a good design strategy is to use
   approximately 20\% of these bits to quantize the channel gain
   information, with the remainder to quantize the channel direction, and
   this allocation is largely insensitive to the secrecy outage constraint
   imposed. In addition, we find that 8 feedback bits per transmit antenna
   is sufficient to achieve approximately 90\% of the throughput attainable
   with perfect feedback.}},

Title = {{Maximization of wave motion within a hydrocarbon reservoir for

Abstract = {{We discuss a systematic methodology for investigating the feasibility of
   mobilizing oil droplets trapped within the pore space of a target
   reservoir region by optimally directing wave energy to the region of
   interest. The motivation stems from field and laboratory observations,
   which have provided sufficient evidence suggesting that wave-based
   reservoir stimulation could lead to economically viable oil recovery.
   Using controlled active surface wave sources, we first describe the
   mathematical framework necessary for identifying optimal wave source
   signals that can maximize a desired motion metric (kinetic energy,
   particle acceleration, etc.) at the target region of interest. We use
   the apparatus of partial-differential-equation (PDE)-constrained
   optimization to formulate the associated inverse-source problem, and
   deploy state-of-the-art numerical wave simulation tools to resolve
   numerically the associated discrete inverse problem.
   Numerical experiments with a synthetic subsurface model featuring a
   shallow reservoir show that the optimizer converges to wave source
   signals capable of maximizing the motion within the reservoir. The
   spectra of the wave sources are dominated by the amplification
   frequencies of the formation. We also show that wave energy could be
   focused within the target reservoir area, while simultaneously
   minimizing the disturbance to neighboring formations - a concept that
   can also be exploited in fracking operations.
   Lastly, we compare the results of our numerical experiments conducted at
   the reservoir scale, with results obtained from semi-analytical studies
   at the granular level, to conclude that, in the case of shallow targets,
   the optimized wave sources are likely to mobilize trapped oil droplets,
   and thus enhance oil recovery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Urban intersections crashes cause significant economic loss. The safety
   management process undertaken by most states in the United States is
   referred to as Highway Safety Improvement Program and consists of three
   standardized steps: (i) identification of critical crash locations, (ii)
   development of countermeasures, and (iii) resource allocation among
   identified crash locations. Often these three steps are undertaken
   independently, with limited detail of each step at the state planning
   agencies. The literature review underlines the importance of the third
   step, and the lack of sophisticated tools available to state planning
   agencies for leveraging information obtained from the first two steps.
   Further, non-strategic approaches and unavailability of methods for
   evaluating policies may lead to sub-optimal funding allocation. This
   paper overcomes these limitations and proposes multiple optimal resource
   allocation strategies for improvements at urban intersections that
   maximize safety benefits, under budget and policy constraints. Proposed
   policy measures based on benefits maximization (economic
   competitiveness), equitable allocation (equity), and relaxation of
   mutually exclusiveness (multiple alternatives at one location) produce
   significantly different alternative and fund allocation. The proposed
   models are applied to selected intersections in four counties of
   southeast Michigan. Results reinforce the applicability of the
   strategies/policies and tools developed in this paper for safety project
   funding allocation on critical urban intersections. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents a mixed-integer programming model for a variant of
   the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. The fleet is assumed
   to be heterogeneous with a novel feature that allows the vehicles to be
   configured before service begins to handle various types of demand. The
   work was motivated by a daily route planning problem arising at a senior
   activity center. A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to
   transport participants to and from the center, as well as to secondary
   facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of
   participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on
   how it is configured.
   An exact method is introduced based on branch and price and cut. At each
   node in the search tree, the master problem is solved by column
   generation to find a lower bound. To improve the bound, subset-row
   inequalities are applied to the variables of the master problem. Columns
   are generated by solving the pricing subproblems with a labeling
   algorithm enhanced by new dominance conditions. Local search on the
   current set of columns is used to quickly find promising additions.
   Implementation details and ways to improve the performance of the
   overall procedure are discussed. Testing was done on a set of real
   instances as well as a set of randomly generated instances with up to 50
   customer requests. The results show that optimal solutions are obtained
   in the majority of cases.}},

   with pressure gradient}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Shock wave/boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) is studied in a large
   area-ratio axisymmetric nozzle comprising a design exit Mach number of
   5.58. Shock motion unsteadiness is captured by way of the dynamic wall
   pressure and is evaluated during overexpanded operations up to a nozzle
   pressure ratio of 65. Stationary SWBLI is first considered at a nozzle
   pressure ratio of 28.7 such that the internal flow structure is in a
   restricted shock separated state; the mean position of the annular
   separation shock resides at a fixed position. Conditional averages of
   the wall pressure fluctuations show how the motion of the incipient
   separation shock is out of phase with pressure fluctuations measured in
   the separated region downstream of the shock; pressure decreases when
   the shock moves downstream and vice versa. This is indicative of a long
   intermittent region, in terms of the boundary layer thickness, as the
   observed phenomena can be explained by translating the static wall
   pressure profile along with the shock motion. Non-stationary SWBLI is
   then considered by increasing the nozzle pressure ratio over time
   (transient start-up). Under these conditions, the shock pattern varies
   in strength and structure as it sweeps through the nozzle. A
   time-frequency analyses of the fluctuating wall pressure during the
   non-stationary operations, and at the same location that the stationary
   unsteadiness is analyzed, reveals a similar spectral footprint. However,
   for relatively slower start-ups, the amplitude of the unsteadiness is
   reduced by a factor of about seven. The findings demonstrate how the
   rate at which the nozzle pressure ratio increases can have a significant
   influence on the amplitude of the unsteady shock foot motion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes that in some instances, the magnetic saw effect is
   purely a melt phenomenon and describes a series of experiments where the
   magnetic saw effect was studied by varying the submillimeter radius of
   the enhancement point on a set of highly controlled samples. The
   magnetic saw effect is an instability that can occur when high currents
   are required to make sharp bends, thereby greatly enhancing the magnetic
   field and current densities. These sharp bends generally occur at
   joints, cuts, or other flaws and can cause failure of high-current
   conductors. The magnetic saw effect has also been proposed as a possible
   metal-cutting mechanism for manufacturing purposes. Due to the very
   small length scales of the features associated with magnetic sawing, it
   is difficult to make samples that are controlled enough to get
   reproducible experimental results for systematic studies. In these
   experiments, printed circuit board technology was used to accurately
   make samples with very fine enhancement features. The conditions for the
   magnetic saw effect were modeled using an electromagnetic code to
   establish the important parameters that predict the onset of damage.}},

   professionals to statistically quantify the potential influence of the
   task strings on cost and schedule success. Statistical analysis
   supported the hypothesis that those task strings which were viewed as
   being more important to cost and schedule success would also be viewed
   as being more critically interdependent. Hence, completion of the PCP-PE
   task combination was viewed as being a key ingredient for project
   success. The research reported in this paper provides a strong
   theoretical foundation for further studies on the influence of task
   strings on project performance. Ultimately, by elucidating the
   relationship between preconstruction planning and project execution
   tasks, the research reported in this paper can help electrical
   contractors achieve project performance improvement through effective
   task-level strategies.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of tubulogenesis and endothelial phenotype expression by MSCs}},
Journal = {{MICROVASCULAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{26-35}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Stem cell-based therapies are a promising new avenue for treating
   ischemic disease and chronic wounds. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have
   a proven ability to augment the neovascularization processes necessary
   for wound healing and are widely popular as an autologous source of
   progenitor cells. Our lab has previously reported on PEGylated fibrin as
   a unique hydrogel that promotes spontaneous tubulogenesis of
   encapsulated MSCs without exogenous factors. However, the mechanisms
   underlying this process have remained unknown. To better understand the
   therapeutic value of PEGylated fibrin delivery of MSCs, we sought to
   clarify the relationship between biomaterial properties and cell
   behavior. Here we find that fibrin PEGylation does not dramatically
   alter the macroscopic mechanical properties of the fibrin-based matrix
   (less than 10\% difference). It does, however, dramatically reduce the
   rate of diffusion through the gel matrix. PEGylated fibrin enhances the
   tubulogenic growth of encapsulated MSCs demonstrating fluid-filled
   lumens by interconnected MSCs. Image analysis gave a value of 4320 +/-
   1770 pm total network length versus 618 +/- 443 gm for unmodified
   fibrin. PEGylation promotes the endothelial phenotype of encapsulated
   MSCs compared to unmodified fibrin as evidenced by higher levels of
   endothelial markers (von Willebrand factor, 2.2-fold; vascular
   endothelial cadherin, 1.8-fold) and vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF, up to 1.8-fold). Prospective analysis of underlying molecular
   pathways demonstrated that this endothelial-like MSC behavior is
   sensitively modulated by hypoxic stress, but not VEGF supplementation as
   evidenced by a significant increase in VEGF and MMP-2 secretion per cell
   under hypoxia. Further gain-of-function studies under hypoxic stress
   demonstrated that hypoxia culture of MSCs in unmodified fibrin could
   increase both vWF and VE-cadherin levels to values that were not
   significantly different than cells cultured in PEGylated fibrin. This
   result corroborated our hypothesis that the diffusion-limited
   environment of PEGylated fibrin is augmenting endothelial
   differentiation cues provided by unmodified fibrin. However, MSC
   networks lack platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1)
   expression, which indicates incomplete differentiation towards an
   endothelial cell type. Collectively, the data here supports a revised
   understanding of MSC-derived neovascularization that contextualizes
   their behavior and utility as a hybrid endothelial-stromal cell type,
   with mixed characteristics of both populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{We address a generalized Voronoi partitioning problem for a team of
   mobile agents with nonlinear dynamics with respect to a state-dependent
   proximity metric. In particular, the proximity (pseudo-) metric
   corresponds to the reduction of a generalized energy metric that occurs
   during the transfer of an agent to an arbitrary destination with zero
   terminal velocity, in finite time. The realization of every finite-time
   state transition takes place by means of a class of continuous feedback
   control laws that render the closed loop dynamics of each mobile agent
   non-Lipschitzian. The arrival time also turns out to be a
   state-dependent quantity, whose functional description is not prescribed
   a priori. We show that the partitioning problem studied in this work can
   admit a decentralized solution, that is, each agent can compute its own
   cell independently from its teammates provided that is aware of the
   positions and velocities of its neighboring agents. Numerical
   simulations that illustrate the theoretical developments are also
   presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lipogenic organisms provide an ideal platform for biodiesel and

   engineering efforts, lipogenesis titers in Yarrowia lipolytica were

   horn decreased biomass generation rates. Here, we employ a rapid
   evolutionary metabolic engineering approach linked with a floating cell
   enrichment process to improve lipogenesis rates, titers, and yields.
   Through this iterative process, we were able to ultimately improve
   yields horn our prior strain by 55\% to achieve production titers of
   39.1 g/L with upwards of 76\% of the theoretical maximum yield of
   conversation. Isolated cells were saturated with up to 87\% lipid
   content. An average specific productivity of 0.56 g/L/h was achieved
   with a maximum instantaneous specific productivity of 0.89 g/L/h during
   the lipid production phase in fermentation. Genomic sequencing of the
   evolved strains revealed a link between a decrease/loss of function
   mutation of succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, uga2, suggesting the
   importance of gamma-aminobutyric acid assimilation in lipogenesis. This
   linkage was validated through gene deletion experiments. This work
   presents an improved host strain that can serve as a platform for

Abstract = {{Diffractive coupling in the plasmonic nanoparticle arrays introduces the
   collective plasmon resonances with high scattering efficiency and narrow
   linewidth. However, the collective plasmon resonances can be suppressed
   when the arrays are supported on the solid-state substrates with
   different superstrates because of the different dispersion relations
   between the substrate and the superstrate. Herein, we develop a general
   concept which seeks to synergize the subnanoparticle engineering of
   ``hot spots{''} with the far-field coupling behavior, for the versatile
   control of plasmonic-photonic couplings in an asymmetric environment. To
   demonstrate our concept, we choose as an example the Au nanobeaker
   arrays (NBAs), which are the conformally coated Au thin layers on the
   interior sidewalls and bottoms of nanohole arrays in SiO2 substrates.
   Using the finite-difference time-domain simulations, we show that
   engineering the plasmonic ``hot spots{''} in the NBAs by simply
   controlling the depth-to-diameter aspect ratio of individual units
   enables multiple plasmonic-photonic couplings in an asymmetric
   environment. These couplings are robust with a wide range of resonance
   wavelengths from visible to infrared. Furthermore, the angle-dependent
   transmission spectra of the arrays reveal a transition from band-edge to
   propagating state for the orthogonal coupling and a splitting of
   diffraction waves in the parallel coupling. The proposed NBAs will find
   enhanced applications in plasmonic lasers and biosensing. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This article describes the stroke volume selection and operational
   design for the toroidal ventricular assist device (TORVAD), a
   synchronous, positive-displacement ventricular assist device (VAD). A
   lumped parameter model was used to simulate hemodynamics with the TORVAD
   compared with those under continuous-flow VAD support. Results from the
   simulation demonstrated that a TORVAD with a 30 ml stroke volume
   ejecting with an early diastolic counterpulse provides comparable
   systemic support to the HeartMate II (HMII) (cardiac output 5.7 L/min up
   from 3.1 L/min in simulated heart failure). By taking the advantage of
   synchronous pulsatility, the TORVAD delivers full hemodynamic support
   with nearly half the VAD flow rate (2.7 L/min compared with 5.3 L/min
   for the HMII) by allowing the left ventricle to eject during systole and
   thus preserving native aortic valve flow (3.0 L/min compared with 0.4
   L/min for the HMII, down from 3.1 L/min at baseline). The TORVAD also
   preserves pulse pressure (26.7 mm Hg compared with 12.8 mm Hg for the
   HMII, down from 29.1 mm Hg at baseline). Preservation of aortic valve
   flow with synchronous pulsatile support could reduce the high incidence
   of aortic insufficiency and valve cusp fusion reported in patients
   supported with continuous-flow VADs.}},

Title = {{24-hour pattern of falls in hospitalized and long-term care

Abstract = {{Falls are common among the elderly >65 years of age and can result in
   both serious trauma and costly medical care. The epidemiology of falls
   in the elderly typically focuses on identifying contributory exogenous
   environmental and endogenous age-related physical, cognitive and other
   health status factors; however, one potentially important variable
   seldom considered is time of fall. We sought to determine if falls in
   hospitalized/institutionalized elderly persons exhibit 24 h and other
   temporal patterns, since knowledge of such could be useful in their
   prevention. We conducted a systematic review of the published literature
   to critically appraise and synthesize the methods and findings of
   previous reports addressing clock-time, day-of-week and month-of-year
   fall patterns of institutionalized elderly cohorts. Medline, SCOPUS,
   Ovid SP and Web of Knowledge were systematic assessed, entering search
   terms of ``accidental fall{''}, ``circadian rhythm{''}, ``biological
   clocks{''}, ``circadian clocks{''}, ``activity cycles{''},
   ``periodicity{''}, and with databases accepting an age limiter, ``age of
   65(+) years{''}. Methodological quality was assessed by STROBE and
   CONSORT checklists, respectively, in observational and clinical studies.
   Publications were reviewed if meeting inclusion criteria of: (i) being
   an empirical study, (ii) adopting circadian and/or other period
   rhythmicity as a fall risk, and (iii) focusing on
   hospitalized/institutionalized falls in those >= 65 years of age; plus
   exclusion criteria of: (i) cohort <65 years of age and (ii) reports as
   dissertations or editorials. The search retrieved 170 publications;
   however, only nine met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Typically, past
   studies disregarded the temporal aspects of fall incidents; the few that
   did varied in quality, institutional setting, and patient type, i.e.
   medical diagnoses. Overall, findings suggest a single or double-peak 24
   h pattern of fall incidence, with time of greatest incidence seemingly
   associated with circadian rhythm-dependent differences in the symptom
   intensity of dominating medical diagnoses (e.g. heart failure versus
   Alzheimer syndrome) among sample cohorts plus location (e.g. bathroom
   versus hallway) of occurrence. Future research is urgently required to
   define temporal patterns in falls and their etiology, e.g. relative to
   circadian and other rhythms in both the manifestation and intensity of
   medical conditions and adverse effects of medications according to
   scheduling, plus staff personnel number and work schedules as it affects
   patient oversight, and cyclic environmental conditions (e.g. light
   intensity exposure) to best design preventive measures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel dynamic element matching (DEM) technique for
   multi-bit Delta Sigma digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The proposed
   technique can address errors due to both static element mismatch and
   dynamic inter-symbol-interference (ISI). The proposed technique ensures
   no ISI-induced distortion even at large signal amplitudes by
   de-correlating the instantaneous number of DAC transitions from the
   signal. It can shape the total number of transitions and whiten the
   individual transition sequence, thereby significantly reducing the
   in-band ISI errors. The proposed technique can be easily extended to
   higher-order shaping for both static mismatch and ISI errors. An
   efficient hardware implementation based on the vector-quantizer mismatch
   shaping framework is also presented. Simulation results show that the
   proposed technique can significantly improve DAC linearity in presence
   of both static mismatch and dynamic ISI errors.}},

Abstract = {{The study of light at the nanoscale has become a vibrant field of

   nanoarchitectures, light can be scattered, refracted, confined,
   filtered, and processed in fascinating new ways that are impossible to
   achieve with natural materials and in conventional geometries. This
   control over light at the nanoscale has not only unveiled a plethora of
   new phenomena but has also led to a variety of relevant applications,
   including new venues for integrated circuitry, optical computing, solar,

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Ghosting flame phenomena and the corresponding fire dynamics in a corner
   ceiling vented cabin were experimentally studied. Various parameters
   including fuel mass loss rate (MLR), gas and fuel temperature as well as
   local oxygen concentration were measured in the experiments. Ghosting
   flame was observed when the fuel MLR increased to its maximum value and
   the oxygen concentration dropped to extremely low levels in large
   ceiling vent tests. A cross flow is expected above the burner. The most
   striking characteristics of the ghosting flame are its less luminous
   blue color at the flame base and its location relative to the ceiling
   vent. Two essential conditions must be satisfied for the occurrence of
   such flame phenomenon: the flame must blow off from the original
   location and it must be able to stabilize somewhere else. The transition
   for ghosting flame behavior is the flame being blown off. Based on the
   stabilization theory, a flame will destabilize where the local gas flow
   rate exceeds nearly three times the local premixed flame burning
   velocity. It is plausible that flame blow-off will occur for these near
   limit flames. After blow-off, flame moves to a different location where
   the crossflow velocity is lower and stabilizes in this region.}},

Abstract = {{As the feature size of semiconductor process further scales to sub-16 nm
   technology node, triple patterning lithography (TPL) has been regarded
   as one of the most promising lithography candidates along with extreme
   ultraviolet, electron beam lithography, and directly self-assembly. M1
   and contact layers, which are usually deployed within standard cells,
   are the most critical and complex parts for modern digital designs.
   Traditional design flow that ignores TPL in early stages may limit the
   potential to resolve all the TPL conflicts. In this paper, we propose a
   coherent framework, including standard cell compliance and detailed
   placement, to enable TPL friendly design. Considering TPL constraints
   during early design stages, such as standard cell compliance, improves
   the layout decomposability. With the precoloring solutions of standard
   cells, we present a TPL aware detailed placement where the layout
   decomposition and placement can be resolved simultaneously. In addition,
   we propose a linear dynamic programming to solve TPL aware detailed
   placement with maximum displacement, which can achieve good trade-off in
   terms of runtime and performance. Experimental results show that our
   framework can achieve zero conflict, meanwhile can effectively optimize
   the stitch number and placement wire-length.}},

Abstract = {{Selective laser sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing technique
   for rapidly creating parts directly from a computer-aided design (CAD)
   model by using a laser to fuse successive layers of powder. However,
   better understanding of the effect of particle-level variations on the
   overall build quality is needed. In this work, we investigated these
   effects computationally by considering the role of the particle size
   distribution and variations in the powder bed depth to mimic the part
   complexity found in overhangs and protrusions. In addition, the results
   from these studies can be distilled to obtain better effective material
   properties such as laser absorptivity and laser extinction coefficient
   that are needed for continuum models of the process. We implement a
   Monte Carlo ray-tracing algorithm within the discrete element model in
   the open-source simulation software MFiX. Random, loose-packed, particle
   bed structures are generated, and effective absorptivity and extinction
   coefficients are calculated. Results are compared against previous
   computational and experimental measurements for free, monodisperse, and
   deep powder beds, with good agreement being obtained. Correlations along
   with uncertainties are developed to allow the effective absorptivity and
   extinction coefficient as a function of various particle and operational
   parameters to be accurately set in SLS macroscale models.}},

Abstract = {{This article demonstrates the ability of surface-coated triboluminescent
   materials to detect damage in carbon fiber-reinforced polymer specimens.
   An experimental protocol was developed to test the efficiency of the
   triboluminescent-based diagnostic method using carbon fiber-reinforced
   polymer coupons under combined bending-compression conditions.
   Luminescence, emitted from the triboluminescent coatings under
   quasi-static loading, was detected by capturing digital images. We
   employed image processing software to quantify change in luminescence as
   a function of triboluminescent concentration. We observed that 10\%,
   20\%, and 30\% triboluminescent coating resulted in 25.3, 27.9, and 40.4
   (arbitrary units) total luminescence, respectively, which shows a
   positive correlation of triboluminescent concentration with
   luminescence. Finite element simulation was also performed to understand
   the stress and strain distribution and to aid in understanding and
   correlating light emission regions on the carbon fiber-reinforced
   polymer coupons under bending deformation. This work represents a step
   toward the development of a robust technology that employs
   triboluminescent materials for early damage detection, consistent with
   theoretical predictions of damage occurrence.}},

   the phase-field variable containing an entropy inequality. We introduce
   a novel incremental approximation that decouples displacement and
   phase-field problems. We establish convergence to a solution of the

Abstract = {{The simulation of thunderstorm downbursts and associated loads on a
   utility-scale wind turbine is the focus of this study. Using a
   deterministic-stochastic hybrid model, downburst-related wind fields are
   generated separately from non-turbulent and turbulent parts. The
   non-turbulent part builds on available analytical models developed from
   field data that include recorded downburst events; the turbulent part is
   simulated as a stochastic process using standard turbulence power
   spectral density functions and coherence functions adjusted by
   information on parameters such as the downburst's translation velocity.
   Key thunderstorm downburst-related parameters include the maximum radial
   velocity, the height and radial distance to the maximum radial velocity,
   the downburst intensity, the downburst translation velocity and the
   downburst translation direction. In addition, the streamwise ambient
   (environmental) velocity and the downburst touchdown location relative
   to the wind turbine are also important in turbine load computation. A
   utility-scale 5-MW wind turbine model is selected, and loads are
   generated using stochastic simulation of the aeroelastic response.
   Information available in the literature on recorded downbursts is used
   to define the cases studied. A single downburst simulation and
   associated turbine response simulation is first discussed to illustrate
   loads computation and highlight downburst-related parameters of
   interest. Next, a Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to
   investigate the influence of touchdown locations and translation
   direction on turbine extreme loads. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{61-79}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Flow in a network of numerous channels is a complex phenomenon that
   cannot be adequately modeled by 1-D models. Despite this, it is a common
   practice to model flow in each channel with the 1-D St. Venant
   equations. These channels are coupled with each other by prescribing
   some interior boundary conditions, which are either too simplistic to
   reproduce the physics accurately or are computationally expensive. In
   this paper, we present a dimensionally heterogeneous approach to resolve
   these issues. We treat flows in individual channels as 1-D flows. These
   channels are coupled together at junctions using a 2-D junction region.
   We present a systematic numerical treatment of the 1-D and the 2-D
   shallow water equations in the framework of an RKDG method so that the
   coupling between the 1-D and the 2-D domains is natural, conservative
   and consistent with the numerical scheme. We verify the 1-D and the 2D
   code via comparisons with different analytical solutions for a wide
   variety of cases. We establish the accuracy of our heterogeneous
   junction model by comparing the simulation results to experimental data
   and to the results obtained from other junction models. (C) 2015

Pages = {{84-93}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to limit the environmental impact of concrete materials,
   there is increasing interest in the development and use of a wider range
   of minerals as acceptable supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs).
   This study investigated calcined blended clays of kaolinite and
   bentonite, with impurities, to assess their feasibility as SCMs. The
   combined use of Rietveld quantitative x-ray diffraction (RQXRD) and
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques proved useful in initially
   gauging amorphous content post-calcination, lending insight into the
   relationship between calcination temperature and pozzolanic reactivity.
   The results demonstrated that for the calcined blended clays, as the
   amorphous content increased, the SCM consumed more portlandite and the
   compressive strength of cement-SCM mortars increased. Blends of
   kaolinite-bentonite clays, containing initially 35 wt.\% crystalline
   kaolinite prior to calcination, achieved roughly 10\% increase in
   compressive strength over samples containing 100 wt\% cement, at 90
   days. Blended kaolinite SCMs may offer significant advantages as a
   low-cost alternative binder or cement replacement material, with the
   ability to maintain or enhance mechanical strength. Published by

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{215-223}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes an Air Diffusion Performance Index (ADPI) model for
   diffuser selection when considering the operation in all-air heating
   mode. The model uses Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) Index adopted by
   ANSI/ASHRAE Standard-55 to develop the relation between indoor air
   temperature and velocity. This paper also generates an ADPI selection
   guide for the application of 13 types of widely used ceiling, high
   sidewall and linear slot diffusers. The selection guide is developed
   based on 97 experiments in a full-scale environmental chamber by
   measuring the ADPI as a function of two factors: (1) the ratio of throw
   length of jets from diffusers to room characteristic length, and (2)
   diffuser types. Moreover, the measurements consider different diffuser
   sizes and manufactures. The selection guide discusses possible thermal
   stratification occurring at heating mode conditions and incorporates
   this factor into the proposed ADPI model. Overall, the measurements show
   that all 13 types of diffusers can generate ADPI greater than 80\% when
   they are properly used. However, some diffusers are less sensitive to
   the variation of supply airflow rate than others. Linear bar grilles and
   round ceiling diffusers are the most suitable for application when
   supply flow varies during HVAC operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy is a partially or completely
   reversible form of myocardial dysfunction due to sustained
   supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Asynchrony, rapid cardiac
   rates and rhythm irregularities are the main factors involved in the
   development of the disease. The reversible nature of arrhythmia-induced
   cardiac dysfunction allows only for a retrospective diagnosis of the
   disease once cardiac function is restored following heart rate control.
   A high level of suspicion is needed to make a diagnosis at an early
   stage and prevent further progression of the disease. Although
   reversible, arrhythmia-induced cellular and molecular changes may
   remain, increasing the risk for sudden death even when normal ejection
   fraction is restored as well as causing rapid deterioration of cardiac
   function and development of heart failure symptoms if arrhythmia recurs.
   Appropriate management based on a combination of pharmacologic and
   nonpharmacologic strategies to achieve rate control and prevent
   arrhythmia recurrence is pivotal to avoid further cardiac function
   deterioration and to control symptoms, significantly reducing the risk
   of heart failure and sudden cardiac death.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, bandpass statistical models of natural, photographic
   images of the world have been used with great success to solve highly
   diverse problems involving image representation, image repair, image
   quality assessment (IQA), and image compression. One missing element has
   been a reliable and generic model of spatial image correlation that
   reflects the distributions of oriented and relatively oriented spatial
   structures. We have developed such a model for bandpass pristine images
   and have generalized it here to also capture the spatial correlation
   structure of bandpass distorted images. The model applies well to both
   luminance and depth images. As a demonstration of the usefulness of the
   generalized model, we develop a new no-reference stereoscopic/3D IQA
   framework, dubbed stereoscopic/3D blind image naturalness quality index,
   which utilizes both univariate and generalized bivariate natural scene
   statistics (NSS) models. We first validate the robustness and
   effectiveness of these novel bivariate and correlation NSS features
   extracted from distorted stereopairs, then demonstrate that they are
   predictive of distortion severity. Our experimental results show that
   the resulting 3D image quality predictor based in part on the new model
   outperforms state-of-the-art full-and no-reference 3D IQA algorithms on
   both symmetrically and asymmetrically distorted stereoscopic image
   pairs.}},

Abstract = {{Soft-constraint semi-supervised affinity propagation (SCSSAP) adds
   supervision to the affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm
   without strictly enforcing instance-level constraints. Constraint
   violations lead to an adjustment of the AP similarity matrix at every
   iteration of the proposed algorithm and to addition of a penalty to the
   objective function. This formulation is particularly advantageous in the
   presence of noisy labels or noisy constraints since the penalty
   parameter of SCSSAP can be tuned to express our confidence in
   instance-level constraints. When the constraints are noiseless, SCSSAP
   outperforms unsupervised AP and performs at least as well as the
   previously proposed semi-supervised AP and constrained expectation
   maximization. In the presence of label and constraint noise, SCSSAP
   results in a more accurate clustering than either of the aforementioned
   established algorithms. Finally, we present an extension of SCSSAP which
   incorporates metric learning in the optimization objective and can
   further improve the performance of clustering.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{In vitro systems for applying mechanical strain to cultured cells are
   commonly used to investigate cellular mechanotransduction pathways in a
   variety of cell types. These systems often apply mechanical forces to a
   flexible membrane on which cells are cultured. A consequence of the
   motion of the membrane in these systems is the generation of flow and
   the unintended application of shear stress to the cells. We recently
   described a flexible system for applying mechanical strain to cultured
   cells, which uses a linear motor to drive a piston array to create
   biaxial strain within multiwell culture plates. To better understand the
   fluidic stresses generated by this system and other systems of this
   type, we created a computational fluid dynamics model to simulate the
   flow during the mechanical loading cycle. Alterations in the frequency
   or maximal strain magnitude led to a linear increase in the average
   fluid velocity within the well and a nonlinear increase in the shear
   stress at the culture surface over the ranges tested (0.5-2.0 Hz and
   1-10\% maximal strain). For all cases, the applied shear stresses were
   relatively low and on the order of millipascal with a dynamic waveform
   having a primary and secondary peak in the shear stress over a single
   mechanical strain cycle. These findings should be considered when
   interpreting experimental results using these devices, particularly in
   the case when the cell type used is sensitive to low magnitude,
   oscillatory shear stresses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the actuator-level control of Valkyrie, a new
   humanoid robot designed by NASA's Johnson Space Center in collaboration
   with several external partners. Several topics pertaining to Valkyrie's
   series elastic actuators are presented including control architecture,
   controller design, and implementation in hardware. A decentralized
   approach is taken in controlling Valkyrie's many series elastic degrees
   of freedom. By conceptually decoupling actuator dynamics from robot limb
   dynamics, the problem of controlling a highly complex system is
   simplified and the controller development process is streamlined
   compared to other approaches. This hierarchical control abstraction is
   realized by leveraging disturbance observers in the robot's joint-level
   torque controllers. A novel analysis technique is applied to understand
   the ability of a disturbance observer to attenuate the effects of
   unmodeled dynamics. The performance of this control approach is
   demonstrated in two ways. First, torque tracking performance of a single
   Valkyrie actuator is characterized in terms of controllable torque
   resolution, tracking error, bandwidth, and power consumption. Second,
   tests are performed on Valkyrie's arm, a serial chain of actuators, to
   demonstrate the robot's ability to accurately track torques with the
   presented decentralized control approach.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel integrated visualization system that enables the
   interactive visual analysis of ensemble simulations and estimates of the
   sea surface height and other model variables that are used for storm
   surge prediction. Coastal inundation, caused by hurricanes and tropical
   storms, poses large risks for today's societies. High-fidelity numerical
   models of water levels driven by hurricane-force winds are required to
   predict these events, posing a challenging computational problem, and
   even though computational models continue to improve, uncertainties in
   storm surge forecasts are inevitable. Today, this uncertainty is often
   exposed to the user by running the simulation many times with different
   parameters or inputs following a Monte-Carlo framework in which
   uncertainties are represented as stochastic quantities. This results in
   multidimensional, multivariate and multivalued data, so-called ensemble
   data. While the resulting datasets are very comprehensive, they are also
   huge in size and thus hard to visualize and interpret. In this paper, we
   tackle this problem by means of an interactive and integrated visual
   analysis system. By harnessing the power of modern graphics processing
   units for visualization as well as computation, our system allows the
   user to browse through the simulation ensembles in real time, view
   specific parameter settings or simulation models and move between
   different spatial and temporal regions without delay. In addition, our
   system provides advanced visualizations to highlight the uncertainty or
   show the complete distribution of the simulations at user-defined
   positions over the complete time series of the prediction. We highlight
   the benefits of our system by presenting its application in a real-world
   scenario using a simulation of Hurricane Ike.}},

   have been developed via high energy mechanical milling (HEMM), and the

   well-developed electrochemically active nanocrystalline material
   (Cu6Sn5) as well as a hybrid conductive matrix (TiC and C). The
   incorporation of 2 vol. \% FEC additive into the electrolyte further
   improves the performance of Cu6Sn5-TiC-C nanocomposite to display a

Abstract = {{The weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (WSGG) model is widely used in
   engineering computations of radiative heat transfer due to its relative
   simplicity, robustness and flexibility. This paper presents the
   computation of radiative heat transfer in a 2D axisymmetric chamber
   using two WSGG models to compute radiation in H2O and CO2 mixtures. The
   first model considers a fixed ratio between the molar concentrations of
   H2O and CO2, while the second allows the solution for arbitrary ratios.
   The correlations for both models are based on the HITEMP2010 database.
   The test case considers typical conditions found in turbulent methane
   flames, with steep variations in the temperature field as well as in the
   molar concentrations of the participating species. To assess the
   accuracy of the WSGG model, the results are compared with a solution
   obtained by line-by-line integration (LBL) of the spectrum. (C) 2015

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The successful deployment of a large scale solar powered wireless sensor
   network in an urban, desert environment is a very complex task. Specific
   cities of such environments cause a variety of operational problems,
   ranging from hardware faults to operational challenges, for instance due
   to the high variability of solar energy availability. Even a seemingly
   functional sensor network created in the lab does not guarantee reliable
   long term operation, which is absolutely necessary given the cost and
   difficulty of accessing sensor nodes in urban environments. As part of a
   larger traffic flow wireless sensor network project, we conducted
   several deployments in the last two years to evaluate the long-term
   performance of solar-powered urban wireless sensor networks in a desert
   area. In this article, we share our experiences in all domains of sensor
   network operations, from the conception of hardware to post-deployment
   analysis, including operational constraints that directly impact the
   software that can be run. We illustrate these experiences using numerous
   experimental results, and present multiple unexpected operational
   problems as well as some possible solutions to address them. We also
   show that current technology is far from meeting all operational
   constraints for these demanding applications, in which sensor networks
   are to operate for years to become economically appealing. (C) 2015

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{A numerical reservoir model was created to optimize Huff-and-Puff
   operations in the Bakken Shale. Huff-and-Puff is an enhanced oil
   recovery method in which a well alternates between injection, soaking,
   and production. Injecting CO2 (or other gases) into the formation and
   allowing it to ``soak'' re-pressurizes the reservoir and improves oil
   mobility, boosting production from the well. A compositional reservoir
   simulator (CMG GEM) was used to study various design components of the
   Huff-and-Puff process in order to identify the parameters with the
   largest impact on recovery and understand the reservoir's response to
   cyclical gas injection. It was found that starting Huff-and-Puff too
   early in the life of the well diminishes its effectiveness, and that
   shorter soaking periods are preferable over longer waiting times.
   Huff-and-Puff works best in reservoirs with highly-conductive natural
   fracture networks, which allow CO2 to migrate deep into the formation
   and mix with the reservoir fluids. Doubling the number of hydraulic
   fractures per stage results in considerably greater gas injection
   requirements without proportionally larger incremental recovery factors.
   Incremental recovery from CO2 Huff-and-Puff appears to be insufficient
   to make the process commercially feasible under current economic
   conditions. However, re-injecting mixtures of CO2 and produced
   hydrocarbon gases was shown to be technically and economically viable,
   and could significantly improve profit margins of Huff-and-Puff
   operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   analysis}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{98-103}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this rapid communication, we address two important issues regarding
   the calculation of fragment mass-size distribution fractal dimension. We
   particularly focus on particle-size distribution, as a special case of
   fragment mass-size distribution, and demonstrate that the arithmetic
   mean concept frequently used in the literature is not supported. We also
   show that ignoring lower and upper cutoffs of fractal scaling may
   significantly alter the mass fractal dimension value. For these
   purposes, two examples using experiments available in the literature are
   given, and critical analyses are discussed in detail. We also reanalyze
   three databases reported in the literature, recalculate the mass fractal
   dimension, and show that applying the arithmetic mean concept and/or
   ignoring the lower and upper cutoffs may result in substantially
   different fractal dimension values. We note that the lower and upper
   cutoffs have to be reported in addition to the mass fractal dimension
   value. We also emphasize that accurate determination of the fractal
   scaling parameters, such as fractal dimension and lower and upper
   cutoffs requires precise characterization of the mass-size distribution.

Abstract = {{The dual weighted residual method (DWR) and its localization for mesh
   adaptivity applied to elliptic partial differential equations are
   investigated. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, we
   introduce a novel localization technique based on the introduction of a
   partition of unity. This new technique is very easy to apply, as neither
   strong residuals nor jumps over element edges are required. Second, we
   compare and analyze (theoretically and numerically) different
   localization techniques used for mesh adaptivity with respect to their
   effectivity. Here, we focus on localizations in variational formulations
   that do not require the evaluation of the corresponding differential
   operator in the classical strong formulation. In our mathematical
   analysis, we show for different localization techniques (established
   methods and our new approach) that the local error indicators used for
   mesh adaptivity converge with proper order in the error functional.
   Several numerical tests substantiate our theoretical investigations. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper proposes active power distribution nodes (APDNs) as an
   effective interface that can improve availability of power distribution

   having bidirectional power flow capability and embedded energy storage,
   APDNs are able to increase both operational flexibility and availability
   of power networks. The embedded energy storage can minimize potential
   power interruptions experienced by the load. In addition, modularity is
   also inherent in the configuration of APDNs. The advantages of using
   APDNs as a connection interface inside a power network are discussed
   from an availability point of view in a quantitative manner by
   performing a comparison using Markov-based availability models. The
   configuration, characteristics, and operation states of the APDN are
   introduced, and a two-level hierarchical control approach that regulates
   the voltage/current level and performs energy management is discussed.

Abstract = {{We use molecular dynamics simulations to test integral equation theory
   predictions for the structure of fluids of spherical particles with

   can be predicted by analytical or simple numerical closures including
   Percus-Yevick, hypernetted-chain, and reference hypernetted-chain
   closures and first-order mean spherical and modified first-order mean
   spherical approximations. To make quantitative comparisons between the
   predicted and simulated radial distribution functions, we introduce a

Abstract = {{We theoretically and numerically analyze thermal invisibility based on

   suppressed, and the heat flow outside the object and the cloak made of

Abstract = {{During deep-sea oil leaks, dispersants may be used to break up the oil
   into droplets smaller than about 70 mu m, which may then be
   bioremediated by bacteria before they reach: the oceaft surface. To
   investigate the mechanism of droplet formation as a function of
   dispersant type, concentration, and jet velocity, a flowing oleophilic
   stream containing amphiphiles Was mixed With flowing dodecane and then
   atomized through a 0.25 mm circular nozzle. The minimum droplet
   diameters were 2.2, 4.5, and 24 mu m for only 5 w:v \% amphiphile in the
   oil phase for Corexit 9500A, Tergitol 15-S-7 (C12H25CH(OCH2CH2)(7)OH),
   and a silica nanoparticle/Span 20 mixture, respectively. For Tergitol
   15-S-7, the droplet size exhibited the expected scaling with Weber
   riuniber (We) at low viscosity numbers (Vi < 50); where inertial
   forces,overcome interfacial forces, and Reynolds number (Re) at high Vi
   numbers (Vi > 50); where inertial forces overcome viscous forces.
   However; in the case of the silica nanoparticle/ Span 20 mixture, the
   magnitude of the exponent of We scaling was found to be smaller than

Abstract = {{The utilization of nonionie surfactants for stabilization of CO2 foams
   has been limited by low aqiieous solubilities at.elevated temperatures:
   and salinities. In this work, a norricinic surfactant C12-14(EO)(22)
   with a high degree of ethoxylation resulted in a high cloud point
   temperature of 83 degrees C even in 90 g/L NaCl brine: Despite the
   relatively high hydrophilic-CO2-philic balance, the surfactant
   adsorption at the C-W interface lowered the interfacial tension to mN/m
   at a CO, density of g/rriL, as determined withrcaptive bubble
   tensiometry. The adsorption was sufficient to stabilize a CO2-in-water
   (C/W) foam with an apparent viscosityof similar to 7 cP at 80 degrees C,
   essentially up to the cloud point temperature, in the presence of 90 g/L
   NaCl brine in a 30 darcy sand pack. In a 1.2 darcy glass bead pack the
   apparent viscosity of the foam in the presence of 0.8\% total dissolved
   solids (TDS) brine reached the highest viscosity of similar to 350 cP at
   60\% foam quality (volume percent CO2) at a low superficial velocity of
   6 ft/day. Shear-thinning behavior was observed in both the glass bead
   pack and the sand pack irrespective of the pernieability difference. In
   addition, C12-14(EO)(22) stabilized C/W foam with an apparent viscosity
   of 80-100 cP in a 49 niclarcy dolomite core formed through a coinjection
   and a surfactant-alternating-gas prodess. The dodecane-0.8\% TDS brine
   partition co-efficient for C12-14(EO)(22) was below 0.1 at 40 degrees C
   and 1 atm. The formation of strong foam in the porous media and the low
   oil-brine partition coefficient indicate C12-14(EO)(22) has potential
   for CO2-enhanced oft recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Steam methane reforniing is a mature and complex process extensively
   used worldwide for hydrogen production from methane. The process takes
   place in a steam methane reformer (SMR), with the endothermic reforming
   reactions being carried out in catalyst-filled tubes placed in a
   gas-fired furnace. The SMR is an energy-intensive process unit, arid
   maximizing energy efficiency iS of primary interest. however, the
   high-temperature conditions and large physical scale of the process
   (hundreds of tubes and burners) pose several operational challenges
   related to distributed sensing, actuation, and feedback control. Various
   efforts have been reported on optimization of furnace Operation using
   rigorous computatibnal fluid dynamics (CFD)-based models but,heing
   computatibnally Intensive, these models are unsuitable for real-time
   optimization. In this paper, we present an integrated framework that
   relies on the use of advanced temperature sensors, soft sensors, and
   reduced-order and rigorous SMR CFD models for distributedvaramaer
   control Of a hydrogen production test bed. We show a validation of cnir
   strategy through a case study on a representative SMR Model.

Abstract = {{Using all atom molecular dynamics and trajectoty-extending kinetic Monte
   Carlo simulations, we study the influence of Al2O3 nanoparticles on the
   transport properties of ions in polymer electrolytes composed of
   poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) melt solvated with LiBF4 Salt. We observe
   that the mobility of Li+ cations and BF4- anions and the overall
   conductivity decrease upon addition of nanoparticles. Our results
   suggest that the nanoparticles slow the dynamics of polymer segments
   near their surfaces, Moreover, the preferential interactions of the ions
   with the nanoparticles are seen to lead to an enhancement of ion,
   concentration tear the particle surfaces and a further reduction in the
   polymer mobilities near the surface. Together, these effects are seen,
   to increase the residence times of Li+ Cations near the polymer backbone
   in the vicinity of the nanoparticles and reduce the overall mobility and
   conductivity of the electrolyte. Overall, our simulation results suggest
   that-both the nanoparticle-induced changes in polymer dynamical
   properties and the interactions between the nanoparticles and ions
   influence the conductivity of the electrolyte.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the structural and dynamic properties of confined binary
   hard-sphere mixtures designed to mimic realizable colloidal thin films.
   Using computer simulations, governed by either Newtonian or overdamped
   Langevin dynamics, together with other techniques including a
   Fokker-Planck equation-based method, we measure the position-dependent
   and average diffusivities of particles along structurally isotropic and
   inhomogeneous dimensions of the fluids. At moderate packing fractions,
   local single-particle diffusivities normal to the direction of
   confinement are higher in regions of high total packing fraction;
   however, these trends are reversed as the film is supercooled at denser
   average packings. Auxiliary short-time measurements of particle
   displacements mirror data obtained for experimental supercooled
   colloidal systems. We find that average dynamics can be approximately
   predicted based on the distribution of available space for particle
   insertion across orders of magnitude in diffusivity regardless of the
   governing microscopic dynamics. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   the c-axis and the volume of that for a typical brownmillerite (s.g
   Pcmb). This superstructure consists of Fe1O(4) and Co1O(4) tetrahedral
   layers containing Fe1 and Co1 atoms, which alternate with (Fe,Co)2O(6)
   and (Fe,Co)3O(6) octahedral layers. In an ``in situ{''} NPD experiment
   of Ca2Fe0.8Co1.2O5-delta at the working temperature of the SOFC, this
   compound shows the presence of a sufficiently high oxygen deficiency,
   with large displacement factors for oxygen atoms that suggest a large
   lability and mobility. In single test cells these cathode materials
   generated a maximum power of 412 mW/cm(2) at 850 degrees C with pure H-2
   as a fuel. The electrodes were supported on a 300-mm-thick pellet of the
   electrolyte La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta (LSGM). The measured thermal
   expansion coefficients between 300 and 850 degrees C exhibit an
   excellent chemical compatibility with the electrolyte. The obtained
   compounds display a semiconductor-like behavior with conductivity values
   at the SOFCs working temperatures (650-850 degrees C) that are
   sufficient to yield a good performance in IT-SOFC. Copyright (C) 2015,

Title = {{On the Presence of Affine Fibril and Fiber Kinematics in the Mitral

Pages = {{2074-2087}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that the constituent fibers
   follow an affine deformation kinematic model for planar collagenous
   tissues. Results from two experimental datasets were utilized, taken at
   two scales (nanometer and micrometer), using mitral valve anterior
   leaflet (MVAL) tissues as the representative tissue. We simulated MVAL
   collagen fiber network as an ensemble of undulated fibers under a
   generalized two-dimensional deformation state, by representing the
   collagen fibrils based on a planar sinusoidally shaped geometric model.
   The proposed approach accounted for collagen fibril amplitude, crimp
   period, and rotation with applied macroscopic tissue-level deformation.
   When compared to the small angle x-ray scattering measurements, the
   model fit the data well, with an r(2) = 0.976. This important finding
   suggests that, at the homogenized tissue-level scale of similar to 1 mm,
   the collagen fiber network in the MVAL deforms according to an affine
   kinematics model. Moreover, with respect to understanding its function,
   affine kinematics suggests that the constituent fibers are largely
   noninteracting and deform in accordance with the bulk tissue. It also
   suggests that the collagen fibrils are tightly bounded and deform as a
   single fiber-level unit. This greatly simplifies the modeling efforts at
   the tissue and organ levels, because affine kinematics allows a
   straightforward connection between the macroscopic and local fiber
   strains. It also suggests that the collagen and elastin fiber networks
   act independently of each other, with the collagen and elastin forming
   long fiber networks that allow for free rotations. Such freedom of
   rotation can greatly facilitate the observed high degree of mechanical
   anisotropy in the MVAL and other heart valves, which is essential to
   heart valve function. These apparently novel findings support modeling
   efforts directed toward improving our fundamental understanding of
   tissue biomechanics in healthy and diseased conditions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{The optimized thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6 peaks
   at about 750K because its relatively narrow band gap results in
   pronounced bipolar transport at higher temperatures. To suppress the
   bipolar transport, we have conducted a combined experimental and
   theoretical investigation of Ge-substitution effects on the band
   structures and thermoelectric properties of Sb-doped Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6-yGey
   (y = 0, 0.1, and 0.2) synthesized by solid state reaction. The measured
   transport properties of these compositions can be interpreted by a
   triple-parabolic-band model based on first-principle calculation of band
   structures. The results show that the bipolar conduction in the
   temperature range up to 800K was effectively suppressed by Ge
   substitution that widens the band gap. As a side effect, Ge substitution
   induces the separation of two otherwise converged conduction bands in
   Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6, leading to reduced thermoelectric performance at low
   temperatures. The result of these two competing effects is that
   Ge-substituted samples achieve the maximum power factor similar to that
   of Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6, but with an increased peak temperature. In addition,
   Ge substitution reduces the bipolar thermal conductivity while
   maintaining the low lattice thermal conductivity of Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study atomic force microscopy (AFM) creep indentations were
   performed to extract viscoelastic properties of the different domains
   (defined as microrheology) observed in bitumen samples from two
   different sources. The microrheology and geometry obtained using the AFM
   were used to perform finite element (FE) simulations to study the effect
   of bitumen microstructure on internal stress distribution. FE analyses
   suggest that microstructures with varying mechanical properties cause
   localised stress amplification that can lead to cracking/phase
   separation. A custom-made loading frame in conjunction with an AFM was
   used to examine the effects of tensile strain on bitumen microstructure.
   FE simulation and experimental results show that applying strain
   resulted in damage/phase separation concentrated in the interstitial
   zone between neighbouring bee structures, defined as load-induced phase
   separation. This study suggests that evaluating the bitumen
   microstructure and microrheology is critical to understanding the
   mechanisms of damage evolution in bitumen and engineering binders with

Abstract = {{A test and analysis method to determine both the damage and healing
   characteristics of an asphalt composite using the same test specimen is
   presented. The test involves applying multiple stretches of load cycles,

   of stiffness reduction. The analytical procedure involves using the
   modified correspondence principles and viscoelastic continuum damage
   mechanics to model damage and healing properties of the composite. The
   results obtained using two different asphalt mortars confirmed the
   findings from previous researchers that the characteristic
   pseudo-stiffness versus damage relationship for each material was
   independent of testing conditions. More importantly, this study
   demonstrated that the aforementioned relationship was also independent
   of the rest periods introduced intermittently during the fatigue test.
   Results also show that healing defined in terms of the change in the
   state variable of damage was independent of the conditions used to
   induce fatigue damage.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the potential of collocation methods for efficient
   higher-order analysis on standard nodal finite element meshes. We focus
   on a collocation method that is variationally consistent and
   geometrically flexible, converges optimally, embraces concepts of
   reduced quadrature, and leads to symmetric stiffness and diagonal
   consistent mass matrices. At the same time, it minimizes the evaluation
   cost per quadrature point, thus reducing formation and assembly effort
   significantly with respect to standard Galerkin finite element methods.
   We provide a detailed review of all components of the technology in the
   context of elasto-dynamics, that is, weighted residual formulation,
   nodal basis functions on Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points, and
   symmetrization by averaging with the ultra-weak formulation. We quantify
   potential gains by comparing the computational efficiency of collocated
   and standard finite elements in terms of basic operation counts and
   timings. Our results show that collocation is significantly less
   expensive for problems dominated by the formation and assembly effort,
   such as higher-order elastostatic analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate
   the potential of collocation for efficient higher-order explicit
   dynamics. Throughout this work, we advocate a straightforward
   implementation based on simple modifications of standard finite element
   codes. We also point out the close connection to spectral element
   methods, where many of the key ideas are already established. Copyright

Abstract = {{Mg alloy AZ31B-H24 sheet was investigated through microstructural
   characterization and mechanical testing. Tension tests were conducted
   across a broad range of strain rates for temperatures from 22 up to 450
   degrees C, as were gas-pressure bulge tests for several forming
   pressures at 350 degrees C. Tensile data were used to calculate flow
   stresses, tensile elongations, activation energies for creep and the
   Lankford coefficient, or R-value. The AZ31B material exhibits strong
   plastic anisotropy (R=7) at room temperature because of its basal
   crystallographic texture. Plastic anisotropy decreases with increasing
   temperature but demonstrates no sensitivity to strain rate until
   recrystallization occurs. Upon recrystallization, the R-value becomes
   sensitive to strain rate and continues decreasing with increasing
   temperature until it reaches a minimum (R=1-3) near approximately 300
   degrees C. Plastic anisotropy at these high temperatures is greatest at
   the fastest strain rate. This sensitivity to strain rate is attributed
   to a competition between dislocation-climb creep, which produces
   anisotropic flow and dominates at fast strain rates, and
   grain-boundary-sliding creep, which produces isotropic flow and
   dominates at slow strain rates. The mechanistic understanding developed
   for plastic flow in AZ31B was implemented in a material constitutive
   model for deformation at 350 degrees C. A new aspect of this model is
   the inclusion of dislocation pipe diffusion as a potential accommodation
   mechanism for dislocation-climb creep. This model was validated against
   independent gas-pressure bulge test data through the predictions of a
   finite-element-method simulation, and the model provided quite accurate
   predictions of the experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In glacierized fjords, the ice-ocean boundary is a physically and
   biologically dynamic environment that is sensitive to both glacier flow
   and ocean circulation. Ocean ambient noise offers insight into processes
   and change at the ice-ocean boundary. Here we characterize fjord ambient
   noise and show that the average noise levels are louder than nearly all
   measured natural oceanic environments (significantly louder than sea ice
   and nonglacierized fjords). Icy Bay, Alaska, has an annual average sound
   pressure level of 120dB (referenced to 1Pa) with a broad peak between
   1000 and 3000Hz. Bubble formation in the water column as glacier ice
   melts is the noise source, with variability driven by fjord circulation
   patterns. Measurements from two additional fjords, in Alaska and
   Antarctica, support that this unusually loud ambient noise in Icy Bay is
   representative of glacierized fjords. These high noise levels likely
   alter the behavior of marine mammals.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of macrophages (MPs) is essential for skeletal muscle to
   properly regenerate following injury. The aim of this study was the
   evaluation of MP profiles and their importance in skeletal muscle
   recovering from tourniquet-induced ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Using
   flow cytometry, we identified two distinct CD11b(+) MP populations that
   differ in expression of the surface markers Ly-6C and F4/80. These
   populations are prominent at 3 and 5 days of reperfusion and molecularly
   correspond to inflammatory and anti-inflammatory MP phenotypes. Sorted
   MP populations demonstrated high levels of IGF-I expression, and whole
   muscle post-I/R IGF-I expression strongly correlates with F4/80
   expression. This suggests MPs largely influence postinjury IGF-I
   upregulation. We additionally demonstrate that direct intramuscular
   injection of FACS-isolated CD11b(+)Ly-6C(lo)F4/80(hi) MPs improves the
   functional and histological recovery of I/R-affected muscle. Taken
   together, these data further support the substantial influence of the
   innate immune system on muscle regeneration and suggest MP-focused
   therapeutic approaches may greatly facilitate skeletal muscle recovery
   from substantial injury.}},

Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{78-88}},

Abstract = {{Engineered three-dimensional biomaterials are known to affect the
   regenerative capacity of stem cells. The extent to which these materials
   can modify cellular activities is still poorly understood, particularly
   for adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). This study evaluates PEGylated
   fibrin (P-fibrin) gels as an ASC-carrying scaffold for encouraging local
   angiogenesis by comparing with two commonly used hydrogels (i.e.,
   collagen and fibrin) in the tissue-engineering field. Human ASCs in
   P-fibrin were compared to cultures in collagen and fibrin under basic
   growth media without any additional soluble factors. ASCs proliferated
   similarly in all gel scaffolds but showed significantly elongated
   morphologies in the P-fibrin gels relative to other gels. P-fibrin
   eliated higher von Willebrand factor expression in ASCs than either
   collagen or fibrin while cells in collagen expressed more smooth muscle
   alpha actin than in other gels. VEGF was secreted more at 7 days in
   fibrin and P-fibrin than in collagen and several other angiogenic and
   immunomodulatory cytokines were similarly enhanced. Fibrin-based
   matrices appear to activate angiogenic signaling in ASCs while P-fibrin
   matrices are uniquely able to also drive a vessel-like ASC phenotype.
   Collectively, these results suggest that P-fibrin promotes the
   angiogenic potential of ASC-based therapeutic applications. (C) 2015

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{287}},
Pages = {{150-171}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{We consider adaptive finite element methods for a multiscale system
   consisting of a macroscale model comprising a system of
   reaction-diffusion partial differential equations coupled to a
   microscale model comprising a system of nonlinear ordinary differential
   equations. A motivating example is modeling the electrical activity of
   the heart taking into account the chemistry inside cells in the heart.
   Such multiscale models are computationally challenging due to the
   multiple scales in time and space that are involved.
   We describe a mathematically consistent approach to couple the
   microscale and macroscale models based on introducing an intermediate
   ``coupling scale{''}. Since the ordinary differential equations are
   defined on a much finer spatial scale than the finite element
   discretization for the partial differential equation, we introduce a
   Monte Carlo approach to sampling the fine scale ordinary differential
   equations. We derive goal-oriented a posteriori error estimates for
   quantities of interest computed from the solution of the multiscale
   model using adjoint problems and computable residuals. We distinguish
   the errors in time and space for the partial differential equation and
   the ordinary differential equations separately and include errors due to
   the transfer of the solutions between the equations. The estimate also
   includes terms reflecting the sampling of the microscale model. Based on
   the accurate error estimates, we devise an adaptive solution method
   using a ``blockwise{''} approach. The method and estimates are
   illustrated using a realistic problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A series of new pentiptycene-containing diamines with systematically
   varied substituent groups were designed and synthesized with high purity
   and high yields. These diamines were used to prepare a series of new
   polyimides with 4,4{''}-hexafluoroisopropylidene bisphthalic dianhydride
   (6FDA) by conventional condensation polymerization. The obtained
   pentiptycene-containing polyimides possessed high molecule weights,
   excellent thermal stability, good solubility in a wide range of organic
   solvents and thus excellent processability for membrane fabrication.
   Because of the excess amount of internal free volume associated with the
   molecular cavities in the pentiptycene moieties and the consequently
   disrupted chain packing, all the polyimides exhibited high fractional
   free volume (FM leading to high gas permeabilities as well as good
   selectivities that are highly desired for gas separation membranes. In
   addition, the comparisons between the pentiptycene-containing polyimides
   bearing various substituent groups indicated that free volume, the vital
   structural parameter for fast and selective molecular transport, was
   very sensitive to the size of the substituent groups. Large substituent
   groups such as CF3 led to increased FFV, while relatively small
   substituent groups such as CH3 resulted in reduced FFV, possibly due to
   the mechanism of ``partial filling{''} of the molecular cavities of
   pentiptycene units by the substituent groups. Gas permeability data also
   supported this unusual trend of the dependence of free volume on the
   substituent groups. This finding provides a completely new and
   potentially novel means of molecular-level manipulations to predictably
   construct preferred free volume architecture that may maximize the
   separation performance of polymeric membranes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Interpolation function is a key parameter for numerical simulation using
   finite-difference, finite-element, and finite-volume methods, especially
   when the advective terms of the conservation equations are considered.
   Due to the flow orientation, a first-order interpolation scheme such as
   upwind introduces a considerable degree of numerical diffusion in the
   numerical solution. In this work, we present a second-order total
   variation diminishing scheme in conjunction with 3D compositional
   reservoir simulation using the element-based finite-volume method
   (EbFVM). The results of several case studies using the hexahedron
   element are shown in terms of oil, water, and gas production, as well as

Abstract = {{Currently, separation of: gaseous Mixtures largely relies on energy
   intensive and expensive processes, like chemical looping of amines. This
   has driven research into less energy-intensive, paSsive methods of
   performing separations such as the use-iof polymer membranes. Although
   pure polymer membranes. `have demonstrated appealing separation
   performance, they suffer froth an inherent trade-off between
   permeability and selectivity, which limits overall performance. Recent
   research efforts have shown that the introduction of a secondary phase,
   often an inorganic species, is added to selectively boost permeability
   or selectivity. However, these hybrid organic/inorganic systems have not
   seen widespread adoption because synthetic control over the size, shape,
   and dispersion of the inorganic species iS poor and understanding of
   transport in these membranes is largely empirical. Thus, understanding
   and optimithig hybrid membranes requires development of well-controlled
   model systems in which size, shape, and surface chemistry of the
   inorganic species are precisely controlled, leading to homogeneous
   membranes amenable to careful sttidy. Here, we report on the synthesis)
   characterization, and gas transport properties of tailored hybrid
   membranes composed of cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) and silica
   nanoparticles. We show excellent control of nanoparticle size, loading,
   and dispersibility. We find that permeability deviations from Maxwell's
   model increases as the size of silica nanopartide decreases and loading
   increases. These size-dependent deviations from Maxwell's model are
   attributed to interfacial interactions, which scale with surface area
   and act to decrease segmental diain mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Lattice dynamics is increasingly acknowledged as playing an important
   role in the ionic transport mechanisms of many oxide ion conductors. In
   particular, specific structural distortionsso-called octahedral
   rotationshave been suggested as the origin of the enhanced mobility
   observed in Ln(2)NiO(4+delta) Ruddlesden-Popper phases (Ln = La, Pr,
   Nd), where oxide interstitial diffusion occurs through an interstitialcy
   mechanism. In this work, we use theory and first-principles calculations
   to unravel and quantify the microscopic link between soft lattice modes
   and migration barriers in the Ln(2)NiO(4+delta) family of materials. We
   show that the magnitude of the migration barriers can be correlated with
   the tendency of each material to undergo an octahedral rotation
   distortion: as the tendency of a material to undergo such a distortion
   increases, the migration barrier decreases. We then use this insight to
   formulate simple design guidelines for further decreasing migration
   barriers through epitaxial strain and that connect trends in the ionic
   transport properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper phases with the structures
   of the parent ANiO(3) perovskites.}},

Abstract = {{Ketoreductases (KRs) from modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) can
   perform stereospecific catalysis, selecting a polyketide with a D- or
   l-alpha-methyl substituent for NADPH-mediated reduction. In this report,
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the
   interactions that control stereospecificity. We studied the A1-type KR
   from the second module of the amphotericin PKS (A1), which is known to
   be stereospecific for a d-a-methyl-substituted diketide substrate (dkD).
   MD simulations of two ternary complexes comprised of the enzyme, NADPH,
   and either the correct substrate, dkD, or its enantiomer (dkL) were
   performed. The coordinates for the A1/NADPH binary complex were obtained
   from a crystal structure (PDB entry 3MJS), and substrates were modeled
   in the binding pocket in conformations appropriate for reduction.
   Simulations were intended to reproduce the initial weak binding of the
   polyketide substrate to the enzyme. Long (tens of nanoseconds) MD
   simulations show that the correct substrate is retained in a
   conformation closer to the reactive configuration. Many short (up to a
   nanosecond) MD runs starting from the initial structures display
   evidence that Q364, three residues N-terminal to the catalytic tyrosine,
   forms a hydrogen bond to the incorrect dkL substrate to yield an
   unreactive conformation that is more favorable than the reactive
   configuration. This interaction is not as strong for dkD, as the
   d-a-methyl substituent is positioned between the glutamine and the
   reactive site. This result correlates with experimental findings
   {[}Zheng, J., et al. (2010) Structure 18, 913-922] in which a Q364H
   mutant was observed to lose stereospecificity.}},

Abstract = {{Turning is an activity of daily living that involves both the
   acceleration of the body center-of-mass (COM) towards the center of
   curvature and rotation of the pelvis towards the new heading. The
   purpose of this study was to understand which muscles contribute to
   turning using experimentation, musculoskeletal modeling and simulation.
   Ten healthy adults consented to walk around a 1-m radius circular path
   at their self-selected walking speed and then along a straight line at
   the same speed. Forward dynamics simulations of the individual subjects
   during the turning and straight-line walking tasks were generated to
   identify the contributions of individual muscle groups to the body
   mediolateral and anterior-posterior COM acceleration impulse and to the
   pelvis angular acceleration impulse. The stance leg gluteus medius and
   ankle plantarflexor muscles and the swing leg adductor muscles were the
   primary contributors to redirect the body's COM relative to
   straight-line walking. In some cases, contributions to mediolateral COM
   acceleration were modulated through changes in leg orientation rather
   than through changes in muscle force. While modulation of the muscle
   contributions generally occurred in both the inner and outer legs,
   greater changes were observed during inner single-leg support than
   during outer single-leg support. Total pelvis angular acceleration was
   minimal during the single-support phase, but the swing leg muscles
   contributed significantly to balancing the internal and external
   rotation of the pelvis. The understanding of which muscles contribute to
   turning the body during walking may help guide the development of more
   effective locomotor therapies for those with movement impairments. (C)

Abstract = {{The catalytic reduction of nitrate is a promising technology for
   groundwater purification because it transforms nitrate into nitrogen and
   water. Recent studies have mainly focused on new catalysts with higher
   activities for the reduction of nitrate. Consequently, metal
   nanoparticles supported on mesoporous metal oxides have become a major
   research direction. However, the complex surface chemistry and porous
   structures of mesoporous metal oxides lead to a non-uniform distribution
   of metal nanoparticles, thereby resulting in a low catalytic efficiency.
   In this paper, a method for synthesizing the sustainable nitrate
   reduction catalyst Pd-In/Al2O3 with a dimensional structure is
   introduced. The TEM results indicated that Pd and In nanoparticles could
   efficiently disperse into the mesopores of the alumina. At room
   temperature in CO2-buffered water and under continuous H-2 as the
   electron donor, the synthesized material (4.9 wt\% Pd) was the most
   active at a Pd-In ratio of 4, with a first-order rate constant (k(obs)
   =0.241 L min(-1) g(cata)(-1)) that was 1.3x higher than that of
   conventional Pd-In/Al2O3 (5 wt\% Pd; 0.19 L min(-1) g(cata)(-1)). The
   Pd-In/mesoporous alumina is a promising catalyst for improving the
   catalytic reduction of nitrate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   porosity, pore diameter, and material thickness on reactive uptake of
   ozone to five materials. The one-dimensional model accounts for
   molecular diffusion from bulk air to the airmaterial interface, reaction
   at the interface, and diffusive transport and reaction through material
   pore volumes. Material-ozone reaction probabilities that account for
   internal transport and internal pore area, gamma(ipa), are determined by
   a minimization of residuals between predicted and experimentally derived
   ozone concentrations. Values of gamma(ipa) are generally less than
   effective reaction probabilities (gamma(eff)) determined previously,
   likely because of the inclusion of diffusion into substrates and
   reaction with internal surface area (rather than the use of the
   horizontally projected external material areas). Estimates of gamma(ipa)
   average 1 x 10(-7), 2 x 10(-7), 4 x 10(-5), 2 x 10(-5), and 4 x 10(-7)
   for two types of cellulose paper, pervious pavement, Portland cement
   concrete, and an activated carbon cloth, respectively. The transport and
   reaction model developed here accounts for observed differences in ozone
   removal to varying thicknesses of the cellulose paper, and estimates a
   near constant gamma(ipa) as material thickness increases from 0.02 to
   0.16 cm.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely understood that selenite can be biologically reduced to
   elemental selenium. Limited studies have shown that selenite can also be
   immobilized through abiotic precipitation with sulfide, a product of
   biological sulfate reduction. We demonstrate that both pathways
   significantly contribute to selenite immobilization in a microfluidic
   flow cell having a transverse mixing zone between propionate and
   selenite that mimics the reaction zone along the margins of a selenite
   plume undergoing bioremediation in the presence of background sulfate.
   The experiment showed that red particles of amorphous elemental selenium
   precipitate on the selenite-rich side of the mixing zone, while long
   crystals of selenium sulfides precipitate on the propionate-rich side of
   the mixing zone. We developed a continuum-scale reactive transport model
   that includes both pathways. The simulated results are consistent with
   the experimental results, and indicate that spatial segregation of the
   two selenium precipitates is due to the segregation of the more
   thermodynamic favorable selenite reduction and the less
   thermodynamically favorable sulfate reduction. The improved
   understanding of selenite immobilization and the improved model can help
   to better design in situ bioremediation processes for groundwater
   contaminated by selenite or other contaminants (e.g., uranium(IV)) that
   can be immobilized via similar pathways.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{To recycle the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from wastewater, ferrum
   ammonium phosphate (FAP)-halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were synthesized
   with simulated wastewater containing N, P, and Fe pollutants as raw
   materials. The adsorption-chemical precipitation in situ method was used
   to synthesize the target products, and the optimal conditions for the
   synthesis of the FAP-HNTs were obtained. Fourier transform Infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning
   electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and
   thermogravimetric analysis were conducted to characterize the samples.
   The FAP particle size was 20-30 nm in the FAP-HNTs. The FTIR spectra
   demonstrated that a small amount of water in the FAP-HNTs promoted the
   curing reaction. The FAP-HNTs and Exolit OP 1230 (OP) were introduced
   into epoxy (EP) to prepare the polymer nanocomposites. The heat release
   rate (HRR) and flammability of the EP composites were tested by
   microscale combustion calorimetry and UL-94 instruments. The mechanical
   properties of the EP composites also were tested by a tension testing
   system. The results indicate that the flame retardancy and mechanical
   properties of the EP composites were improved by FAP-HNT. The addition
   of FAP-HNT and OP gave rise to an evident reduction of HRR and a
   prolonged burning time for the EP. EP/FAP-HNT/OP (20) (where 20 is the
   loading weight percentage) passed the UL 94 V-0 rating. The analysis of
   the char revealed the synergy of the FAP-HNTs and OP in reducing the
   flammability of the polymers. We concluded that these polymers show
   potential for applications in wastewater treatment and N/P recycling.

Abstract = {{The past two decades have witnessed the emergence and rapid growth of
   the research field of nanoscale thermal transport. Much of the work in
   this field has been fundamental studies that have explored the
   mechanisms of heat transport in nanoscale films, wires, particles,
   interfaces, and channels. However, in recent years there has been an
   increasing emphasis on utilizing the fundamental knowledge gained toward
   understanding and improving device and system performances. In this
   opinion article, an attempt is made to provide an evaluation of the
   existing and potential impacts of the basic research efforts in this
   field on the developments of the heat transfer discipline, workforce,
   and a number of technologies, including heat-assisted magnetic
   recording, phase change memories, thermal management of
   microelectronics, thermoelectric energy conversion, thermal energy
   storage, building and vehicle heating and cooling, manufacturing, and
   biomedical devices. The goal is to identify successful examples,
   significant challenges, and potential opportunities where thermal
   science research in nanoscale has been or will be a game changer.}},

Abstract = {{This article studies the scaling limit of a class of shot-noise fields
   defined on an independently marked stationary Poisson point process and
   with a power law response function. Under appropriate conditions, it is
   shown that the shot-noise field can be scaled suitably to have a
   nondegenerate alpha-stable limit, as the intensity of the underlying
   point process goes to infinity. More precisely, finite dimensional
   distributions are shown to converge, and the finite dimensional
   distributions of the limiting random field have i.i.d. stable random
   components. We hence propose to call this limit the alpha-stable white
   noise field. Analogous results are also obtained for the extremal
   shot-noise field that converges to a Frechet white noise field. Finally,
   these results are applied to the modeling and analysis of interference
   fields in large wireless networks.}},
