Abstract = {{Curved surfaces, complex geometries, and time-dynamic deformations of
   the heart create challenges in establishing intimate, non-constraining
   interfaces between cardiac structures and medical devices or surgical
   tools, particularly over large areas. We constructed large area designs
   for diagnostic and therapeutic stretchable sensor and actuator webs that
   conformally wrap the epicardium, establishing robust contact without
   sutures, mechanical fixtures, tapes, or surgical adhesives. These
   multifunctional web devices exploit open, mesh layouts and mount on
   thin, bio-resorbable sheets of silk to facilitate handling in a way that
   yields, after dissolution, exceptionally low mechanical moduli and
   thicknesses. In vivo studies in rabbit and pig animal models demonstrate
   the effectiveness of these device webs for measuring and spatially
   mapping temperature, electrophysiological signals, strain, and physical
   contact in sheet and balloon-based systems that also have the potential
   to deliver energy to perform localized tissue ablation.}},

Abstract = {{The rates of indium mass transport between the wetting layer, the

   distributions probed by cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy of
   the In0.5Ga0.5As/GaAs quantum dot system. During capping, a lateral
   back-segregation from the quantum dots toward the wetting layer is
   found, reversing the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode during quantum dot
   formation. This lateral back-segregation critically affects the

Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{We discuss the rich scattering features offered by thin and thick
   plasmonic layers covering dielectric nanoparticles and their potential
   optical applications. The frequency position of scattering dips and
   peaks may be controlled to a large degree using plasmonic layers, which
   may dramatically vary the total scattering signature in the frequency
   range of interest. We show that complex and exotic spectra may be
   obtained using a single composite nanosphere, including dipole-dipole
   Fano resonances and electromagnetic induced transparency effects. The
   described phenomena are observable at any angle of observation, in the
   total scattering cross section and for realistic plasmonic materials,
   since they are based on purely dipolar fields. Enhanced field amplitudes
   are associated with these anomalous scattering features, which may be
   used to efficiently boost weak optical nonlinear effects. Exciting
   applications of these nanostructures are envisioned, such as efficient
   and tunable sensors, all-optical switches and memories, optical tagging
   and biomolecular imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Evolving faults are faults beginning in one phase of a distribution
   circuit and spreading to another phase after a few cycles. This paper
   develops a time-domain algorithm for estimating the location of such
   faults. The algorithm is divided into two parts, namely, the single
   line-to-ground portion of the fault and the line-to-line-to-ground
   portion of the fault. The arc voltage that exists during faults is taken
   into consideration while deriving this methodology. For the single
   line-to-ground portion of the fault, the distance to the fault is
   estimated in terms of the loop or self-reactance between the monitor and
   the fault. On the other hand, for the line-to-line-to-ground and
   line-to-line portion of the fault the distance is estimated in terms of
   the positive-sequence reactance. The reactance-to-fault estimate is more
   robust than that of the resistance-to-fault, because it is unaffected by
   fault resistance. Two evolving fault cases and two line-to-line fault
   cases are analyzed in detail and the error in the location estimates is
   found to be below 10\% in each case. Ten additional cases are analyzed
   and linear regression analysis is conducted to demonstrate the accuracy
   of the fault location estimates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses how micro-grids availability during natural
   disasters and in their aftermath can be assessed. The analysis focuses
   on two critical groups of components that allow micro-grids to improve
   power supply availability: distributed generators and local energy
   storage. For distributed generators and, due to their importance during
   natural disasters, this paper presents a novel focus by exploring the
   importance of lifelines for system availability. Renewable energy
   sources are identified as valuable distributed generation assets during
   disasters because they do not require lifelines; yet, their variable
   generation nature leads to the need for significant local energy
   storage. Additional local energy storage may be desirable as a backup
   solution to address potential failures that would blackout the load
   because they reduce the impact of lifeline performance during disasters
   on micro-grid availability. Analysis of micro-grids availability is
   performed based on Markov state space models and calculated using
   minimal cut sets approximations. This calculation method has the
   advantage of being very simple, not requiring extensive knowledge in the
   subject or computational needs. Results are verified with numerical
   experiments using Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dc arc model to simplify the study of a critical
   issue in dc microgrids: series faults. The model is derived from a
   hyperbolic approximation of observed arc voltage and current patterns,
   which permit analyzing the arc in terms of its resistance, power,
   energy, and quenching condition. Recent faults staged by the authors on
   a dc microgrid yielded enough data to develop an arc model for three
   fault types: constant-gap speed, fixed-gap distance, and accelerated
   gap. The results in this paper compare experimental and simulation
   results for the three fault types. It is concluded that because the
   instantaneous voltage, current, power, and energy waveforms produced by
   the model agree well with experimental results, the model is suitable
   for transient simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This study discusses how increased deployment of electric vehicles (EVs)
   acts as a catalyst for development of transformer and home energy
   management systems in order to reduce the impact of EV battery charging
   on distribution transformers. The analysis uses actual load consumption
   data from Austin, Texas, during a typical summer day. It also considers
   a case of high-density penetration of electric vehicle in line with
   plans announced as part of Austin's Pecan Street smart grid initiative.
   The presented discussion describes first that because of air conditioner
   use, both during day and at night, power consumption remains relatively
   constant throughout the day, which creates issues even when considering

   with different curing temperature}},

Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of curing temperature, age, and unsaturated
   polyester (UP)-methyl methacrylate (MMA) ratio on the strength
   development characteristics of UP-MMA based polymer concrete are
   investigated. This study distinguishes itself from previous research in
   that MMA monomer was used to adjust the viscosity of UP resin, instead
   of styrene monomer. The result showed that as the curing temperature
   decreased from 20 to -20 degrees C, the strengths were reduced by 32.8\%
   on average. Also, research revealed that the UP-MMA based polymer
   concrete significantly develops its strengths within the first 6 h, and
   the average strength at 72 h was 86.6\% of the strength at 168 h. As the
   MMA content increases, the strengths of UP-MMA based polymer concrete
   tended to decrease. However, the effect of MMA on the strength reduction
   was less significant than that of curing temperature. Also, this study
   proposes a strength predictive model based on the maturity concept. The
   result of regression analysis between the measured strengths and
   computed maturity yielded high coefficients of determination of
   0.91-0.97, validating the applicability of the maturity model suggested
   by Ohama. The findings of this study could be utilized as important data
   for field applications as well as manufacturing of precast products.

Abstract = {{This study experimentally examines the effect of methacrylic acid (MAA)
   on the mechanical properties of polymer concrete using methyl
   methacrylate (MMA)-polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a binder in order
   to develop the polymer concrete that can be used at low temperatures. To
   achieve this aim, a series of laboratory tests were conducted to measure
   the mechanical properties such as compressive strength, splitting
   tensile strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, and
   Poisson's ratio. Along with the mechanical properties, the hardening
   time and working life were also investigated. As a result, adding MAA
   was found to be effective for ensuring the working life at a low
   temperature and improving the strengths at an early stage, especially
   within the first 12 h. Furthermore, research revealed that the higher
   the MAA content, the greater the modulus of elasticity and Poisson's
   ratio. In conclusion, acrylic polymer concrete with excellent mechanical
   properties could be achieved even at a temperature as low as -20 degrees
   C solely by adding MAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomedicine has great potential in biomedical applications, and
   specifically in regenerative medicine and vascular tissue engineering.
   Designing nanonneter-sized therapeutic and diagnostic devices for tissue
   engineering applications is critical because cells experience and
   respond to stimuli on this spatial scale. For example, nanoscaffolds,
   including nanoscale-structured or nanoscale surface-modified vascular
   scaffolds, can influence cell alignment, adhesion, and differentiation
   to promote better endothelization. Furthermore, nanoscale contrast
   agents can be extended to the field of biomedical imaging to monitor and
   track stem cells to better understand the process of neovascularization.
   In addition, nanoscale systems capable of delivering biomolecules (e.g.
   peptides and angiogenic genes/proteins) can influence cell behavior,
   function, and phenotype to promote blood vessel regeneration. This
   review will focus on nanomedicine and nanoscale strategies applied to
   vascular tissue engineering. In particular, some of the latest research
   and potential applications pertaining to nanoscaffolds, biomedical
   imaging and cell tracking using nanoscale contrast agents, and
   nanodelivery systems of bioactive molecules applied to blood vessel
   regeneration will be discussed. In addition, the overlap between these
   three areas and their synergistic effects will be examined as related to
   vascular tissue engineering. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a framework for fluid-structure interaction
   (FSI) modeling and simulation with emphasis on isogeometric analysis
   (IGA) and non-matching fluid-structure interface discretizations. We
   take the augmented Lagrangian approach to FSI as a point of departure.
   Here the Lagrange multiplier field is defined on the fluid-structure
   interface and is responsible for coupling of the two subsystems. Thus
   the FSI formulation does not rely on the continuity of the underlying
   function spaces across the fluid-structure interface in order to produce
   the correct coupling conditions between the fluid and structural
   subdomains. However, in deriving the final FSI formulation the interface
   Lagrange multiplier is formally eliminated and the formulation is
   written purely in terms of primal variables. Avoiding the use of
   Lagrange multipliers adds efficiency to the proposed formulation. As an
   added benefit, the ability to employ non-matching grids for
   multi-physics simulations leads to significantly relaxed requirements
   that are placed on the geometry modeling and meshing tools for IGA.
   We show an application of the proposed FSI formulation to the simulation
   of the NREL 5 MW offshore wind turbine rotor, where the aerodynamics
   domain is modeled using volumetric quadratic NURBS, while the rotor
   structure is modeled using a cubic T-spline-based discretization of a
   rotation-free Kirchhoff-Love shell. We conclude the article by showing
   FSI coupling of a T-spline shell with a low-order finite element method
   (FEM) discretization of the aerodynamics equations. This combined use of
   IGA and FEM is felt to be a good balance between speed, robustness, and
   accuracy of FSI simulations for this class of problems. (C) 2012

   combines full analysis suitability of the basis with straightforward
   implementation in tree data structures and simple generalization to
   higher dimensions. We test hierarchical refinement of NURBS for some
   elementary fluid and structural analysis problems in two and three
   dimensions and attain good results in all cases. Using the B-spline
   version of the finite cell method, we illustrate the potential of
   immersed boundary methods as a seamless isogeometric
   design-through-analysis procedure for complex engineering parts defined
   by T-spline CAD surfaces, specifically a ship propeller and an
   automobile wheel. We show that hierarchical refinement considerably
   increases the flexibility of this approach by adaptively resolving local
   features. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel method to construct solid rational
   T-splines for complex genus-zero geometry from boundary surface
   triangulations. We first build a parametric mapping between the
   triangulation and the boundary of the parametric domain, a unit cube.
   After that we adaptively subdivide the cube using an octree subdivision,
   project the boundary nodes onto the input triangle mesh, and at the same
   time relocate the interior nodes via mesh smoothing. This process
   continues until the surface approximation error is less than a
   pre-defined threshold. T-mesh is then obtained by pillowing the
   subdivision result one layer on the boundary and its quality is
   improved. Templates are implemented to handle extraordinary nodes and
   partial extraordinary nodes in order to get a gap-free T-mesh. The
   obtained solid T-spline is C-2-continuous except for the local region
   around each extraordinary node and partial extraordinary node. The
   boundary surface of the solid T-spline is C-2-continuous everywhere
   except for the local region around the eight nodes corresponding to the
   eight corners of the parametric cube. Finally, a Bezier extraction
   technique is used to facilitate T-spline based isogeometric analysis.
   The obtained Bezier mesh is analysis-suitable with no negative
   Jacobians. Several examples are presented in this paper to show the
   robustness of the algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a tomographic reconstruction method implemented using a
   shape-based regularization technique. Spatial models of known features
   in the structure being reconstructed are integrated into the
   reconstruction process as regularizers. Our regularization scheme is
   driven locally through shape information obtained from segmentation and
   compared with a known spatial model. We demonstrated our method on
   tomography data from digital phantoms, simulated data, and experimental
   electron tomography (ET) data of virus complexes. Our reconstruction
   showed reduced blurring and an improvement in the resolution of the
   reconstructed volume was also measured. This method also produced
   improved demarcation of spike boundaries in viral membranes when
   compared with popular techniques like weighted back projection and the
   algebraic reconstruction technique. Improved ET reconstructions will
   provide better structure elucidation and improved feature visualization,
   which can aid in solving key biological issues. Our method can also be
   generalized to other tomographic modalities.}},

Abstract = {{Results of Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing tests against phasor
   measurement units (PMUs) are presented, which demonstrate that PMUs are
   vulnerable to spoofing attacks. A GPS spoofer can manipulate PMU time
   stamps by injecting a counterfeit ensemble of GPS signals into the
   antenna of the PMU's time reference receiver. A spoofer-induced timing
   error of only a few tens of microseconds causes a PMU to violate the
   maximum phase error allowed by the applicable standard. These and other
   larger errors can give automated or human power grid controllers a false
   perception of the state of the grid, leading to unnecessary, and
   possibly destabilizing, remedial control actions. To emphasize this
   threat, this paper shows that a particular PMU-based automatic control
   scheme currently implemented in Mexico whose control architecture and
   setpoints have been published in the open literature could be induced by
   a GPS spoofing attack to trip a primary generator. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Simple methods, such as the use of density during compositional
   simulations, often fail to identify the phases correctly, and this can
   cause discontinuities in the computed relative permeability values. The
   results are then physically incorrect. Furthermore, numerical simulators
   often slow down or even stop because of discontinuities. There are many
   important applications in which the phase behavior can be single phase,
   gas/liquid, liquid/liquid, gas/liquid/liquid, or gas/liquid/solid at
   different times in different gridblocks. Assigning physically correct
   phase identities during a compositional simulation turns out to be a
   difficult problem that has resisted a general solution for decades. We
   know that the intensive thermodynamic properties, such as molar Gibbs
   free energy, must be continuous, assuming local equilibrium, but this
   condition is difficult to impose in numerical simulators because of the
   discrete nature of the calculations. An alternative approach is to
   develop a relative permeability model that is continuous and independent
   of the phase numbers assigned by the flash calculation. Relative
   permeability is a function of saturation, but also composition, because
   composition affects the phase distribution in the pores (i.e., the
   wettability). The equilibrium distribution of fluids in pores
   corresponds to the minimum in the Gibbs free energy for the entire
   fluid/rock system, including interfaces. In general, however, this
   relationship is difficult to model from first principles. What we can
   easily do is calculate the molar Gibbs free energy (G) of each phase at
   reference compositions where the relative permeabilities are known or
   assumed to be known and then interpolate between these values by use of
   the G calculated during each timestep of the simulation. Relative
   permeability values calculated this way are unconditionally continuous
   for all possible phase-behavior changes, including even critical points.
   We tested the new relative permeability model on a variety of extremely
   difficult simulation problems with up to four phases, and it has not
   failed yet. We illustrate several of these applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to rationalizing the design of work
   areas for drivers who pickup and deliver hundreds of packages a day.
   Taking into account the random nature of demand, visit frequency, and
   service time, the objective is to partition the customers into the
   minimum number of convex, continuous clusters such that each can be
   serviced by a single vehicle within the time available in a day. An
   additional requirement is that the aspect ratio of a work area must
   satisfy certain geometric conditions. The problem is formulated as a
   generic capacitated clustering problem with side constraints and solved
   with a combination of aggregation to achieve analytic tractability,
   column generation to determine good clusters, regeneration to diversify
   the exploration of the feasible region, and heuristic variable fixing to
   find good feasible solutions. A novel set of geometric constraints
   allows for the implicit generation of clusters, and several valid
   inequalities are introduced to strengthen the pricing subproblem
   formulation. In addition, ideas from tabu search are adopted to limit
   the number of subproblems that are solved at each iteration. This
   greatly improved the efficiency of the column generation algorithm
   without sacrificing quality. The methodology was tested with data
   provided by a leading carrier. Six data sets were examined, ranging in
   size from roughly 6000 to 45,000 customers. The results showed that much
   more compact work areas could be obtained than currently exist, and that
   the number of drivers could be reduced by an average of 7.6\%. This
   translates into millions of dollars in annual saving when all service
   areas across the U.S. are taken into account. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fuel cells hold great promise for wide applications in portable,

   high-CO contents and improving the electrocatalytic activity. PEMs with
   high proton conductivity and low methanol crossover are critical for
   lowering catalyst loadings at the cathode and improving the performance

Abstract = {{This review explores recent work directed towards more targeted
   treatment of cancer, whether through more specific anti-cancer agents or
   through methods of delivery. These areas include delivery by avoiding
   the reticuloendothelial system, utilizing the enhanced permeability and

   using antibody-targeted therapies are summarized. The ability to treat
   cancer by targeting delivery through angiogenesis is also discussed and
   antiangiogenic drugs in clinical trials are presented. Delivery methods

Abstract = {{Rework is a persistent problem in construction. Reducing field rework is
   widely regarded as an effective way of improving construction
   performance in terms of productivity, cost, and schedule. Although much
   literature exists concerning rework reduction, there is a need for
   further analysis, validation, and improvement of rework reduction
   methods. This paper presents a generalized model for a rework reduction
   program (RRP), which is intended to reduce rework by managing a
   continuous improvement loop with four functional processes: (1) rework
   tracking and cause classification, (2) evaluation of rework and its
   causes, (3) corrective action planning, and (4) integration of changes
   into the total management system. Analysis is conducted to examine and
   verify the functional mechanisms and effectiveness of the generalized
   model, by investigating a rework reduction program implemented in
   practice for a series of dozens of small projects executed by three
   contractors that represents the generalized model, and by analyzing the
   impact trends on rework in terms of frequency, cost, and labor hours
   over a considerable time period. The paper's primary contribution to the
   overall body of knowledge is that it provides statistical evidence that
   the occurrence and impact of rework can be reduced significantly with
   such a program. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000552. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We undertake establishing well-posedness of the dynamic Biot-Allard

   quasi-static Biot system can be obtained from the dynamic Biot
   equations. These results can be used to formulate an efficient
   computational algorithm for solving dynamic Biot-Allard equations for
   subsurface flows with the characteristic reservoir time scales larger
   than the intrinsical characteristic time. This result appears to be
   completely new in the literature on Biot's theory. We conclude by

Abstract = {{With an industrial trend of going green, the use of natural fibers in
   polymer composites is growing rapidly, especially in the automotive
   industry. The objectives of this research are to investigate mechanical
   performance of kenaf/polypropylene nonwoven composites (KPNCs) in
   production of automotive interior parts, and to develop preliminary
   linear models for quantifying elastic range of the KPNCs under various
   loading conditions. Using polypropylene (PP) fiber as bonding fiber, the
   KPNCs were fabricated with 50/50 blend ratio by weight. Unlike the
   manufacturing method of fiber reinforced plastics, all KPNCs were
   produced by carding and needle-punching techniques and thermally bonded
   by a panel press with 3-mm thickness gauge. Mechanical properties of the
   KPNCs in terms of uniaxial tensile, open-hole tensile, tensile at
   different strain rates, flexural, and in-plane shear were measured
   instrumentally. It was found that sample which was processed at higher
   temperature (230 A degrees C) but shorter time (60 s) had the best
   mechanical performance. KPNCs were relatively insensitive to the notch
   but sensitive to strain rates. The linear elastic finite element model
   of KPNCs agreed well with the experimental results in the valid strain
   range of 0-0.5 \% for uniaxial tensile test and 0-1 \% for flexural
   test.}},

Title = {{Biomechanical variables related to walking performance 6-months

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1017-1022}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Body-weight supported treadmill training has been shown to
   be effective in improving walking speed in post-stroke hemiparetic
   subjects, and those that have shown improvements generally maintain them
   after the completion of rehabilitation. However, currently no
   biomechanical variables are known to be related to those who will either
   continue to improve or regress in their self-selected walking speed
   during the 6-month period following rehabilitation. The objective of
   this study was to identify those biomechanical variables that are
   associated with subjects who continue (or did not continue) to improve
   their self-selected walking speed following the completion of
   rehabilitation.
   Methods: Experimental kinematic and kinetic data were recorded from 18
   hemiparetic subjects who participated in a 6-month follow-up study after
   completing a 12-week locomotor training program that included stepping
   on a treadmill with partial body weight support and manual assistance.
   Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine which
   biomechanical variables evaluated during the post-training session were
   related to changes in self-selected walking speed from post-training to
   a 6-month follow-up session.
   Findings: Following the completion of rehabilitation, the majority of
   subjects increased or retained (i.e., did not change) their
   self-selected walking speed from post-training to the follow-up session.
   Post-training step length symmetry and daily step activity were
   positively related to walking speed improvements.
   Interpretation: Motor control deficits that lead to persistent step
   length asymmetry and low daily step activity at the end of
   rehabilitation are associated with poorer outcomes six months after
   completion of the program. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of a probabilistic model is a key step in most decision
   and risk analyses. Typically this is done by defining a single joint
   distribution in terms of marginal and conditional distributions. The
   difficulty of this approach is that often the joint distribution is
   underspecified. For example, we may lack knowledge of the marginal
   distributions or the underlying dependence structure. In this paper, we
   suggest an approach to analyzing decisions with partial information.
   Specifically, we propose a simulation procedure to create a collection
   of joint distributions that match the known information. This collection
   of distributions can then be used to analyze the decision problem. We
   demonstrate our method by applying it to the Eagle Airlines case study
   used in previous studies.}},

   and hole-collecting interfaces, respectively, in bulk-heterojunction
   polymer solar cells results in different extents of reduction in device
   characteristics, with the insertion of P3HT at the electron-collecting
   interface being less disruptive to the output currents compared to the
   insertion of PCBM at the hole-collecting interface. This asymmetry is
   attributed to differences in the tail state-assisted charge injection
   and recombination at the active layer-electrode interfaces. P3HT
   exhibits a higher density of tail states compared to PCBM; holes in
   these tail states can thus easily recombine with electrons at the
   electron-collection interface during device operation. This process is
   subsequently compensated by the injection of holes from the cathode into
   these tail states, which collectively enables net current flow through
   the polymer solar cell. The study presented herein thus provides a
   plausible explanation for why preferential segregation of P3HT to the
   cathode interface is inconsequential to device characteristics in
   P3HT:PCBM bulk-heterojunction solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{The impact-echo (IE) test method has been widely used to determine the
   thickness of a plate and to locate delaminations in reinforced-concrete
   structures. It was later realized that the IE mode is related to the
   Zero-Group-Velocity S1 Lamb mode (S(1)ZGV). An efficient inspection of a
   structure using rapid, noncontact, air-coupled sensing technology is of
   great interest. The objective of this research is to investigate the
   effectiveness of air-coupled sensing to detect the ZGV Lamb mode
   signals. Numerical simulation and experimental verification were
   performed to study the in-air ZGV vibration responses induced by a point
   impact applied on a concrete plate. Two concrete plates, one without
   delamination and one with delamination, were tested and simulated. For
   each plate, the simulation results agreed well with the experimental
   results, and both methods estimated the plate thickness precisely. The
   numerical simulations also visualized the pressure field in the air and
   are helpful for interpretation of the experimental results. The
   numerical and experimental results suggest that the air-coupled sensing
   technology can serve as an effective and rapid inspection tool for large
   concrete structures.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of incorporating a thin silicon layer into a SiO2-based
   resistive-switching random access memory are presented. An improved
   performance, including a lower electroforming voltage and a more stable
   device current in the high-resistance programmed state, has been
   achieved by physical vapor deposition of a thin silicon layer onto the
   sidewall region of the device. Tristate pulse endurance performance over
   10(6) cycles has been demonstrated. The programmed data show immunity to
   read disturb testing at 1 V and can be sustained up to 150 degrees C
   thermal exposure. It is concluded that the improved performance is due
   to formation of a more robust and more uniform conducting filament. As a
   result of this advantage, stable tristate programming can be realized in
   the SiO2-based resistive memory device.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a method to automatically extract spike features of the
   AIDS virus imaged through an electron microscope. The AIDS virus spike
   is the primary target of drug design as it is directly involved in
   infecting host cells. Our method detects the location of these spikes
   and extracts a subvolume enclosing the spike. We have achieved a
   sensitivity of 80\% for our best operating range. The extracted spikes
   are further aligned and combined to build a 4-D statistical shape model,
   where each voxel in the shape model is assigned a probability density
   function. Our method is the first fully automated technique that can
   extract subvolumes of the AIDS virus spike and be used to build a
   statistical model without the need for any user supervision. We envision
   that this new tool will significantly enhance the overall process of
   shape analysis of the AIDS virus spike imaged through the electron
   microscope. Accurate models of the virus spike will help in the
   development of better drug design strategies.}},

Title = {{Grassmannian Differential Limited Feedback for Interference Alignment}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{6481-6494}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Channel state information (CSI) in the interference channel can be used
   to reduce the dimension of received interference and helps achieve the
   channel's maximum multiplexing gain through what is known as
   interference alignment (IA). Most interference alignment algorithms
   require knowledge of all the interfering channels to compute the
   alignment precoders. CSI, considered available at the receivers, can be
   shared with the transmitters via limited feedback. When IA is done by
   coding over frequency extensions in a single antenna system, the
   required CSI lies on the Grassmannian manifold and its structure can be
   exploited in feedback. Unfortunately, the number of channels to be
   shared grows with the square of the number of users, creating too much
   overhead with conventional feedback methods. This paper proposes
   Grassmannian differential feedback to reduce feedback overhead by
   exploiting both the channel's temporal correlation and Grassmannian
   structure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is characterized
   both analytically and numerically as a function of channel length,
   mobility, and the number of feedback bits. The main conclusions are that
   the proposed feedback strategy allows IA to perform well over a wide
   range of Doppler spreads, and to approach perfect CSI performance in
   slowly varying channels. Numerical results highlight the trade-off
   between the frequency of feedback and the accuracy of individual
   feedback updates.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of allocating limited feedback resources across
   multiple users in an orthogonal-frequency-division-multiple-access
   downlink system with slow frequency-domain scheduling. Many flavors of
   slow frequency-domain scheduling (e. g., persistent scheduling,
   semi-persistent scheduling), that adapt user-sub-band assignments on a
   slower time-scale, are being considered in standards such as 3GPP
   Long-Term Evolution. In this paper, we develop a feedback allocation
   algorithm that operates in conjunction with any arbitrary slow
   frequency-domain scheduler with the goal of improving the throughput of
   the system. Given a user-sub-band assignment chosen by the scheduler,
   the feedback allocation algorithm involves solving a weighted sum-rate
   maximization at each (slow) scheduling instant. We first develop an
   optimal dynamic-programming-based algorithm to solve the feedback
   allocation problem with pseudo-polynomial complexity in the number of
   users and in the total feedback bit budget. We then propose two
   approximation algorithms with complexity further reduced, for scenarios
   where the problem exhibits additional structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we are concerned with a full-waveform-based methodology
   that allows the simultaneous imaging of the soil's stiffness and
   attenuating properties, using solely the soil's surficial response to
   probing waves.
   To date, field observations of small-strain wave attenuation in
   geomaterials at moderate spatial scales suggest that a commonly used
   metric of intrinsic and apparent attenuation, the seismic quality factor
   Q, is frequency-independent for a wide part of the frequency spectrum,
   including the frequency range of interest to seismic applications. We
   discuss first the forward simulation of waves in near-surface soil
   deposits directly in the time-domain using simplified models that
   adequately approximate nearly frequency-independent Q. To this end, we
   first review various attenuation models that aim at reproducing the
   frequency-independent Q behavior, and conclude, supported by site
   analyses, that, even though a generalized Maxwell body with eight
   Maxwell elements in parallel (GMB8) provides the best fit to
   frequency-independent Q we favor a version of it with fewer parameters
   (GMB2), in order to reduce modeling complexity, while still retaining
   good agreement with the GMB8 model.
   We report on forward site analyses that lend credence to the choice of
   the GMB2 simplified model. We, then, use the GMB2 constitutive relation
   in the context of full-waveform inversion, and report on numerical
   experiments that lead to the imaging of the soil's properties in
   heterogeneous semi-infinite domains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The discrete nature of the numerical methods utilized in 1D site
   response analysis and calculation of the response spectra (e.g.,
   frequency domain, Duhamel integral, and Newmark beta methods) introduces
   time-step dependence in the resulting solution. Using an input ground
   motion with too large of a time-step leads to under-prediction of
   high-frequency characteristics of the system response due to limitations
   in the numerical solution of single and multiple degree of freedom
   systems. In order to reduce potential errors, using a sampling rate at
   least ten times greater than the maximum considered frequency is
   recommended. The preferred alternative is selection of input ground
   motions with a sufficiently small time step to avoid introducing
   numerical errors. However, where such motions are not available, then
   the time step of the ground motion can be reduced through interpolation.
   This paper demonstrates that the use of Fourier transform zero-padded
   interpolation is the preferred approach to obtain a ground motion with
   an adequate time step for the calculation of the elastic acceleration
   response spectra, and to analyze site response using either frequency or
   time domain methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a preliminary study demonstrating the capability of
   ultrasound-guided intravascular photoacoustic (IVPA) imaging to
   visualize the depth-resolved distribution of lipid deposits in
   atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. Based on the characteristic optical
   absorption of lipid in the near infrared wavelength range, IVPA imaging
   at a single, 1720 nm, wavelength was used to provide a
   spatially-resolved, direct measurement of lipid content in
   atherosclerotic arteries. By overlaying an IVPA image with a spatially
   co-registered intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) image, the combined
   IVPA/IVUS image was used to visualize lipid distribution within the
   vessel wall. Ultrasound-guided IVPA imaging was performed in vivo in the
   abdominal aorta of a Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit.
   Subsequently, the excised rabbit aorta filled with a solution of red
   blood cells (RBC) was then imaged ex vivo, and histology was obtained in
   the section adjacent to the imaged cross-section. To demonstrate the
   potential for future clinical application of IVPA/IVUS imaging, a sample
   of diseased human right coronary artery (RCA) was also imaged. Both in
   vivo and ex vivo IVPA images clearly showed the distribution of lipid in
   the atherosclerotic vessels. In vivo IVPA imaging was able to identify
   diffuse, lipid-rich plaques in the WHHL rabbit model of atherosclerosis.
   Furthermore, IVPA imaging at a single wavelength was able to identify
   the lipid core within the human RCA ex vivo. Our results demonstrate
   that ultrasound-guided IVPA imaging can identify lipid in
   atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. Importantly, the IVPA/IVUS images were
   obtained in presence of luminal blood and no saline flush or balloon
   occlusion was required. Overall, our studies suggest that
   ultrasound-guided IVPA imaging can potentially be used for
   depth-resolved visualization of lipid deposits within the anatomical
   context of the vessel wall and lumen. Therefore, IVUS/IVPA imaging may
   become an important tool for the detection of rupture-prone plaques.

Abstract = {{The maximum operator in statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) is a
   decent approximation for timing sign-off, but often causes significant
   error in SSTA applications. This paper presents a timing criticality
   computation method based on non-maximum analytic operators in a
   parameterized SSTA. After an SSTA run, the proposed method computes the
   criticality for all edges and nodes in a single graph traversal.
   Although we do not employ the max operator in the computation process,
   the error in the maximum operator still degrades the accuracy of the
   computed criticality because the criticality is a joint probability of
   expressions, including arrival times, which are computed by the maximum
   operator during SSTA. To address this issue, we employ the refactoring
   technique, which was recently proposed to reduce common path pessimism
   in combinational circuits. This paper shows that refactoring is also
   very useful in reducing the maximum-induced error in arrival times, and
   how existing graph-based algorithms can be geared toward refactoring.
   Our experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the error
   of the criticality significantly compared to the conventional
   cutset-based method.}},

Abstract = {{A crucial step in the assessment of an image compression method is the
   evaluation of the perceived quality of the compressed images. Typically,
   researchers ask observers to rate perceived image quality directly and
   use these rating measures, averaged across observers and images, to
   assess how image quality degrades with increasing compression. These
   ratings in turn are used to calibrate and compare image quality
   assessment algorithms intended to predict human perception of image
   degradation. There are several drawbacks to using such omnibus measures.
   First, the interpretation of the rating scale is subjective and may
   differ from one observer to the next. Second, it is easy to overlook
   compression artifacts that are only present in particular kinds of
   images. In this paper, we use a recently developed method for assessing
   perceived image quality, maximum likelihood difference scaling (MLDS),
   and use it to assess the performance of a widely-used image quality
   assessment algorithm, multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM). MLDS
   allows us to quantify supra-threshold perceptual differences between
   pairs of images and to examine how perceived image quality, estimated
   through MLDS, changes as the compression rate is increased. We apply the
   method to a wide range of images and also analyze results for specific
   images. This approach circumvents the limitations inherent in the use of
   rating methods, and allows us also to evaluate MS-SSIM for different
   classes of visual image. We show how the data collected by MLDS allow us
   to recalibrate MS-SSIM to improve its performance.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a natural scene statistic-based distortion-generic
   blind/no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) model that
   operates in the spatial domain. The new model, dubbed
   blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) does not
   compute distortion-specific features, such as ringing, blur, or
   blocking, but instead uses scene statistics of locally normalized
   luminance coefficients to quantify possible losses of ``naturalness{''}
   in the image due to the presence of distortions, thereby leading to a
   holistic measure of quality. The underlying features used derive from
   the empirical distribution of locally normalized luminances and products
   of locally normalized luminances under a spatial natural scene statistic
   model. No transformation to another coordinate frame (DCT, wavelet,
   etc.) is required, distinguishing it from prior NR IQA approaches.
   Despite its simplicity, we are able to show that BRISQUE is
   statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio
   and the structural similarity index, and is highly competitive with
   respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. BRISQUE
   has very low computational complexity, making it well suited for real
   time applications. BRISQUE features may be used for
   distortion-identification as well. To illustrate a new practical
   application of BRISQUE, we describe how a nonblind image denoising
   algorithm can be augmented with BRISQUE in order to perform blind image
   denoising. Results show that BRISQUE augmentation leads to performance
   improvements over state-of-the-art methods. A software release of
   BRISQUE is available online:

Abstract = {{Nano-scale surface patterning can provide highly spectral-directional
   absorption properties for thin film solar cells. Achieving optimal
   surface patterning is an inverse optimization problem that requires a
   numerical procedure capable of scrutinizing the space of geometry
   parameters to search for an optimal solution. In this paper, 2-D and 3-D
   thin film amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cells with periodic structures
   are considered, whereby the surface of the solar cell is textured with
   rectangular metallic nano-patterns for enhancing the solar absorption
   spectrum. We use FDTD simulations to solve Maxwell's equations inside
   the cell area when subject to standard optical irradiation. By means of
   several numerical optimization techniques such as the Quasi-Newton BFGS
   method, random search Simulated Annealing, and Tabu Search, we determine
   optimal specifications for surface nano-patterns. Invoking constrained
   optimization tools, we incorporate various types of practical
   constraints into the optimization programs. The resulting cell
   structures found by the inverse solvers illustrate enhancement factors
   as high as 1.52 in solar absorption when silver nano-patterns are used,
   compared to bare a-Si cells. Results demonstrate the efficiency of the

Abstract = {{In this article, I describe my early interest in graphene and
   contributions that I and my co-authors, in particular, have made to the
   field, along with a brief history of the experimental discovery of
   graphene. I then turn to new carbon materials whose experimental
   syntheses might be on the horizon. One example involves using graphene
   as a template to generate large-area ultrathin sp(3)-bonded carbon
   sheets that could also be substitutionally doped with, for example,
   nitrogen atoms, as one approach to making materials of interest for
   quantum computing. Such large-area sp(3)-bonded carbon sheets hold
   tremendous promise for use in thermal management; as a new material for
   electronics and photonics; and as ultrahigh-strength components in
   various structures including those used in aerospace, among other
   applications. Another example is the class of negative-curvature carbons
   (NCCs) that have atom-thick walls and carbon atoms trivalently bonded to
   other carbon atoms. Such NCCs have a nanoscale pore structure,
   atom-thick walls, and exceptionally high specific surface areas, and
   they fill three-dimensional space in ways that suggest their use as
   electrode materials for ultracapacitors and batteries, as adsorbents, as
   support material for catalysts, and for other applications.}},

Abstract = {{As technology is reaching physical limits, reducing power consumption is
   a key issue on our path to sustained performance. In this paper, we
   study fundamental tradeoffs and limits in efficiency (as measured in
   energy per operation) that can be achieved for an important class of
   kernels, namely the level-3 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). It
   is well-accepted that specialization is the key to efficiency. This
   paper establishes a baseline by studying GEneral Matrix-matrix
   Multiplication (GEMM) on a variety of custom and general-purpose CPU and
   GPU architectures. Our analysis shows that orders of magnitude
   improvements in efficiency are possible with relatively simple
   customizations and fine-tuning of memory hierarchy configurations. We
   argue that these customizations can be generalized to perform other
   representative linear algebra operations. In addition to exposing the
   sources of inefficiencies in current CPUs and GPUs, our results show our
   prototype Linear Algebra Processor (LAP) implementing Double-precision
   GEMM (DGEMM) can achieve 600 GFLOPS while consuming less than 25 Watts
   in standard 45 nm technology, which is up to 50x more energy efficient
   than cutting-edge CPUs.}},

Journal = {{INDOOR AIR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{501-513}},

Abstract = {{This work improves knowledge of particle penetration into buildings by
   (i) refining a particle penetration test method that minimizes the
   duration and invasiveness required by individual tests without
   sacrificing accuracy, (ii) applying the method in an unoccupied
   manufactured test house and 18 single-family homes in Austin, Texas,
   USA, and (iii) exploring correlations between particle penetration and
   building characteristics, including results from blower door air leakage
   tests. The mean (+/- s.d.) measured penetration factor of submicron
   particles (201000 nm, not size-resolved) was 0.47 +/- 0.15 in 19
   residences that relied on infiltration for ventilation air, ranging from
   0.17 +/- 0.03 to 0.72 +/- 0.08. Particle penetration factors (P) and
   outdoor particle source terms (P x air exchange rates) were both
   significantly and positively correlated with results from blower door
   air leakage tests. Outdoor particle source terms were also significantly
   and negatively correlated with the year of construction. These results
   suggest that occupants of leakier and older homes are exposed to higher
   indoor concentrations of outdoor submicron particles than those in
   tighter and newer homes, and that simple air leakage tests may be able
   to provide an approximate prediction of outdoor particle infiltration
   into single-family residences. Practical Implications Results from this
   work suggest that knowledge of simple building characteristics (i.e.,
   the year of construction and blower door test results) may be used to
   predict the ability of outdoor particles to infiltrate into
   single-family residences, which could facilitate easier estimates of
   indoor exposures to outdoor particulate matter across the building
   stock. The methods within can also be extended to other buildings and
   can be used to assess possible changes in penetration factors because of
   envelope retrofits. Because outdoor particle size distributions were not
   measured during this study, these tests should also be repeated with
   size-resolved particle instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen-based power systems, such as fuel cells, are promising clean
   energy technologies. A significant obstacle, however, is the production
   and distribution of hydrogen. Production at the site of use is widely
   believed to be a viable near-term solution. Hydrocarbon fuels that are
   readily transported can be reformed into synthesis gas, or syngas, which
   is a gaseous mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and other species.
   Fuel reforming therefore permits high density energy storage that can
   effectively replace or supplement batteries for remote applications.
   Current industrial methods of syngas production do not scale down
   efficiently, but an alternative method, non-catalytic partial oxidation,
   is a viable option for small scale production. An advantage of this
   method is the lack of catalyst, which is expensive and prone to damage.
   In this paper we present the experimental results of syngas production
   from heptane using a non-catalytic reactor based on the concept of
   counter-flow heat exchange. The reactor operates on the principle of
   heat recirculation in order to achieve temperatures that are
   superadiabatic, or higher than those predicted by equilibrium, thereby
   permitting increased oxidation rates of reactant mixtures. A key
   advantage of this type of reactor is that the reaction zones are
   stationary, allowing continuous operation. Previous studies have
   examined the reforming of methane and propane using the counter-flow
   reactor, and those results are compared with the results of the current
   study. Heptane is notably the first liquid fuel to be reformed using the
   counter-flow reactor. This is important for establishing the fuel
   flexibility of the reactor and, in conjunction with previously acquired
   data, guiding future design and operation. (C) 2012 Published by

Title = {{Evaluation of accuracy of as-built 3D modeling from photos taken by
   handheld digital cameras}},

Abstract = {{As-built documentation is an essential set of records, consisting of
   construction drawings, specifications and equipment location, which are
   kept for facility management purposes. These documents are constantly
   being created and modified throughout the life of a project. This
   process is usually manual and fraught with errors, which inhibits
   reliable decision making. Technological advancements have made it
   possible to generate 3D models to assess as-built conditions for
   construction monitoring purposes, such as verifying conformance to
   baseline project schedules and contract specifications. For this
   purpose, 3D point clouds are widely generated using laser scanners.
   However, this approach has limitations in the construction industry due
   to expensive and fragile equipments, lack of portability and need of
   trained operators. This study aims at investigating an alternate
   technology to generate as-built 3D point clouds using photos taken using
   handheld digital cameras, compare them against the original as-built 3D
   models, and check for accuracy of the modeling process. This analysis
   can aid in a more reliable and effective decision making due to its cost
   effectiveness and ease of use, particularly in heavy infrastructure
   projects which are continually undergoing rehabilitation work. To
   achieve these objectives, a set of guidelines are developed for taking
   photographs that enable effective generation of 3D point clouds using
   off-the-shelf software packages. The accuracy of the modeling process is
   investigated using the results of the as-built 3D point cloud modeling
   of a 2000 ft under construction bridge in southern United States.
   Finally, the range of tolerance and deviation of element dimensions is
   determined by comparing the photo based model to the actual as-built
   model (developed using 20 drawings). Furthermore, to compare point
   clouds generated from laser scanning and photogrammetry, a laser scan
   and an image based survey of an exterior wall of a university building
   were also done. Results show that this technology in its present state
   is not suitable for modeling infrastructure projects, however
   technological developments can enable this to be an efficient way to
   extract measurements of inaccessible objects for progress monitoring
   purposes and the models can also be stored for future dimension takeoffs
   for decision making and asset management purposes. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Various ad hoc methods have been proposed for solving population balance
   equations (PBEs). Relatively little discussion has taken place to
   generalize these discretization approaches. In this paper, a flexible
   method is presented for the discrete solution of PBEs. The method is a
   generalization of similar techniques. The approach allows for complete
   Control of the discretization and order of approximation of the
   solution. A simple error analysis of the method is provided. Simulations
   were performed for pure random breakage, constant kernel aggregation,
   additive kernel aggregation, combined random breakage/constant kernel
   aggregation, and free-molecular Brownian coagulation. The numerical
   results are compared to exact solutions and simulated results from the
   literature. It was found that increasing the quadrature order within the
   sections is a more efficient means to increase accuracy as opposed to
   finer discretization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses the Growing Structure Multiple Model System (GSMMS)
   method for fault detection and precedent-free localization of unwanted
   heating anomalies in two different configurations of channel flow
   systems operated under dynamic conditions: (i) straight channel and (ii)
   straight channel with an internal flow disruptor. Unlike commonly used
   fault detection methods, the newly proposed approach does not require
   prior information regarding the fault location, fault severity or data
   emitted in the presence of a fault to build the model of that fault and
   recognize it. The new detection mechanism is based only on the models of
   normal behavior for various portions of the monitored system. The
   obtained results indicate that the detection and localization of the
   unwanted heating element (i.e., heat source) can be achieved through
   distributed GSMMS-based anomaly detection, with multiple anomaly
   detectors monitoring different parts of each configuration. The results
   also suggest that fault detection and localization are strongly related
   to a system's configuration and operational conditions. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Characteristics of jitter have been investigated in a 10-GHz analog
   optical link using a quadrature-biased MachZehnder modulator followed by
   an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and a PIN photodiode. For the

   power, indicating the thermal noise limited characteristic. For high
   input optical power, jitter saturates at a minimum for different RF
   power levels for the configuration without EDFA. For the configuration
   using EDFA, jitter is also inversely proportional to EDFA gain but shows
   different minima for different input optical power with output power
   fixed by adjusting EDFA gain because of amplified spontaneous noise

Abstract = {{Due to the poor road markings and irregular driving behaviors, not every
   vehicle is positioned in the center of the lane. The deviation from the
   center can cause discomfort to drivers in the neighboring lane, which is
   referred to as lateral discomfort (or lateral friction). Such lateral
   discomfort can be incorporated into the driver stimulus-response
   framework by considering the visual angle and its changing rate from the
   psychological viewpoint. In this study, a two-lane visual angle based
   car-following model is proposed and its stability condition is obtained
   through linear stability theory. Further derivations indicate that the
   neutral stability line of the model is asymmetry and four factors
   including the vehicle width and length, the lateral separation and the
   sensitivity regarding the changing rate of visual angle have large
   impacts on the stability of traffic flow. Numerical simulations further
   verify these theoretical results, and demonstrate that the behaviors of
   diverging, merging and lane changing can break the original steady state
   and cause traffic fluctuations. However, these fluctuations may be
   alleviated to some extent by reducing the lateral discomfort. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{BiSI (indirect band gap = 1.57 eV) is a recently discovered
   photoelectrode material possessing promising optical properties for use
   in alternative thin film solar cells. In this work, we study the effects
   of selenium doping on BiSI film properties and - also demonstrate the
   incorporation of BiS1-xSexI films into both electrochemical and solid
   state solar cells. Tuning the band zap of BiS1-xSexI by substituting
   selenium for sulfur was accomplished by substituting various amounts of
   SeO2 for thiourea in the BiSI spray pyrolysis precursor solutions. This
   strategy was employed to reduce the direct band gap of BiS1-xSexI films
   from 1.63 eV to as low as 1.48 eV, as measured by UV-vis-NIR diffuse
   reflectance spectroscopy for x = 0.4. Both electrochemical and solid
   state solar cell devices utilizing n-BiSI as the light absorbing
   material demonstrated open circuit voltages of nearly 0.4 V. The
   electrochemical devices showed much higher short circuit currents and
   power conversion efficiencies than the solid state devices. Power
   conversion efficiencies of up to 0.25 and 0.012\% were measured for
   electrochemical and solid state devices, respectively, under AM1.5G

Abstract = {{We report the fabrication of back-gated field-effect transistors (FETs)
   using ultra-thin, mechanically exfoliated MoSe2 flakes. The MoSe2 FETs
   are n-type and possess a high gate modulation, with On/Off ratios larger
   than 10(6). The devices show asymmetric characteristics upon swapping
   the source and drain, a finding explained by the presence of Schottky
   barriers at the metal contact/MoSe2 interface. Using four-point,
   back-gated devices, we measure the intrinsic conductivity and mobility
   of MoSe2 as a function of gate bias, and temperature. Samples with a
   room temperature mobility of similar to 50 cm(2)/V.s show a strong
   temperature dependence, suggesting phonons are a dominant scattering

Abstract = {{In this work, we study the adsorption of hydrocarbon. molecules on
   carbonate surfaces by means of first principles calculations based on
   Density Functional Theory (DFT) with and without van der Waals (vdW)
   corrections. Energetic, electronic, and structural properties have been
   determined for the adsorption of the representative hydrocarbons (hexane
   and benzene) on calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite {[}CaMg(CO3)(2)] (10-14)
   dry surfaces. Those hydrocarbons were selected to represent aromatics
   and alkanes on surfaces, and for each molecule the evaluated properties
   are similar for both surfaces. Due to the obtained similarities in both
   surfaces, we have evaluated the vdW corrections only for calcite. Our
   results suggest that Ca sites are the most energetically favorable for
   hydrocarbon adsorption on both minerals. This effect is mostly due to
   the electronic level ordering that leads to charge differences in the
   possible adsorbed sites (Ca, Mg, and CO3) in the carbonate surfaces. The
   vdW corrections strengthen the hydrocarbon surface bond with a
   corresponding reduction in the bond distance between the benzene and the
   surface. However, this reduction is not even for all atoms in the
   molecule, and the angle between the benzene aromatic ring and the
   surface increases. The energy barrier; for the displacement of the
   hydrocarbons along the calcite surface, was determined for
   representative surface direction, using the Nudged Elastic Band method,
   and adsorption energies for the most stable sites show the same order of
   magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The emission of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from vinyl flooring
   (VF) was measured in specially designed stainless steel chambers. In
   duplicate chamber studies, the gas-phase concentration in the chamber
   increased slowly and reached a steady state level of 0.8-0.9 mu g/m(3)
   after about 20 days. By increasing the area of vinyl flooring and
   decreasing that of the stainless steel surface within the chamber, the
   time to reach steady state was significantly reduced, compared to a
   previous study (1 month versus 5 months). The adsorption isotherm of
   DEHP on the stainless steel chamber surfaces was explicitly measured
   using solvent extraction and thermal desorption. The strong partitioning
   of DEHP onto the stainless steel surface was found to follow a simple
   linear relationship. Thermal desorption resulted in higher recovery than
   solvent extraction. Investigation of sorption kinetics showed that it
   takes several weeks for the sorption of DEHP onto the stainless steel
   surface to reach equilibrium. The content of DEHP in VF was measured at
   about 15\% (w/w) using pressurized liquid extraction. The independently
   measured or calculated parameters were used to validate an SVOC emission
   model, with excellent agreement between model prediction and the
   observed gas-phase DEHP chamber concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in material synthesis and in metamaterial technology offer new
   venues to tailor the electromagnetic properties of devices, which may go
   beyond conventional limits in a variety of fields and applications.
   Invisibility and cloaking are perhaps one of the most thought-provoking
   possibilities offered by these new classes of advanced materials. Here,
   recently proposed solutions for invisibility and cloaking using
   metamaterials, metasurfaces, graphene and/or plasmonic materials in
   different spectral ranges are reviewed and highlighted. The focus is
   primarily on scattering-cancellation approaches, describing material
   challenges, venues and opportunities for the plasmonic and the mantle
   cloaking techniques, applied to various frequency windows and devices.
   Analogies, potentials and relevant opportunities of these concepts are
   discussed, their potential realization and the underlying technology
   required to verify these phenomena are reviewed with an emphasis on the
   material aspects involved. Finally, these solutions are compared with
   other popular cloaking techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The use of nanomaterials for strain sensors has attracted attention due
   to their unique electromechanical properties. However, nanomaterials
   have yet to overcome many technological obstacles and thus are not yet
   the preferred material for strain sensors. In this work, we investigated
   graphene woven fabrics (GWFs) for strain sensing. Different than
   graphene films, GWFs undergo significant changes in their
   polycrystalline structures along with high-density crack formation and
   propagation mechanically deformed. The electrical resistance of GWFs
   increases exponentially with tensile strain with gauge factors of
   similar to 10(3) under 2 similar to 6\% strains and similar to 10(6)
   under higher strains that are the highest thus far reported, due to its
   woven mesh configuration and fracture behavior, making it an ideal
   structure for sensing tensile deformation by changes in strain. The main
   mechanism is investigated, resulting in a theoretical model that
   predicts very well the observed behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Following our recently introduced analytical tools to model and design
   conformal mantle cloaks based on metasurfaces {[}Padooru et al., J.
   Appl. Phys. 112, 034907 (2012)], we investigate their performance and
   physical properties when excited by an electric line source placed in
   their close proximity. We consider metasurfaces formed by 2-D arrays of
   slotted (meshes and Jerusalem cross slots) and printed (patches and
   Jerusalem crosses) sub-wavelength elements. The electromagnetic
   scattering analysis is carried out using a rigorous analytical model,
   which utilizes the two-sided impedance boundary conditions at the
   interface of the sub-wavelength elements. It is shown that the
   homogenized grid-impedance expressions, originally derived for planar
   arrays of sub-wavelength elements and plane-wave excitation, may be
   successfully used to model and tailor the surface reactance of
   cylindrical conformal mantle cloaks illuminated by near-field sources.
   Our closed-form analytical results are in good agreement with full-wave
   numerical simulations, up to sub-wavelength distances from the
   metasurface, confirming that mantle cloaks may be very effective to
   suppress the scattering of moderately sized objects, independent of the
   type of excitation and point of observation. We also discuss the dual
   functionality of these metasurfaces to boost radiation efficiency and
   directivity from confined near-field sources. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Nonlinear photoacoustic effects, rarely seen in biomedical photoacoustic
   imaging of tissues, can manifest themselves strongly when plasmonic
   nanoparticles are used as imaging contrast agents. Specifically,
   nonlinear behavior of photoacoustic signal with modest laser fluences
   can occur when nanoparticles undergo cellular endocytosis and
   aggregation leading to thermal coupling and subsequent localized
   temperature enhancement. Our study demonstrated this effect using in
   vitro tissue models containing cells. While the photoacoustic signal
   amplitude was linearly proportional to the cell/nanoparticle
   concentration, the photoacoustic signal increased nonlinearly as the
   laser fluence increased. Our results, therefore, suggest that the
   nonlinear effects can be exploited in molecular/cellular photoacoustic

   phase transition of evaporated copper films from amorphous to (111)
   preferred crystalline, which resulted in subsequent growth of high
   quality graphene, as corroborated by X-ray diffraction and electron
   backscatter diffraction. Noticeably, such phase transition of the copper
   film was observed on a technologically ubiquitous Si wafer with a
   standard amorphous thermal oxide. A modified two-step etching transfer
   process was introduced to preserve the clean surface and electrical
   property of transferred monolayer graphene. The fabricated graphene

Abstract = {{PP/PP-g-MA/MMT/EOR blend nanocomposites were prepared in a twin-screw
   extruder at fixed 30 wt \% elastomer and 0 to 7 wt \% MMT content.
   Elastomer particle size and shape in the presence of MMT were evaluated
   at various PP-g-MA/organoclay masterbatch ratios of 0, 0.5, 1.0, and
   1.5. The organoclay dispersion facilitated by maleated polypropylene
   serves to reduce the size of the elastomer dispersed phase particles and
   facilitates toughening of these blend nanocomposites. The rheological
   data analysis using modified Carreau-Yasuda model showed maximum yield
   stress in extruder-made nanocomposites compared with nanocomposites of
   reactor-made TPO. Increasing either MMT content or the
   PP-g-MA/organoclay ratio can drive the elastomer particle size below the
   critical particle size below which toughness is dramatically increased.
   The ductile-brittle transition shift toward lower MMT content as the
   PP-g-MA/organoclay ratio is increased. The D-B transition temperature
   also decreased with increased MMT content and masterbatch ratio.
   Elastomer particle sizes below similar to 1.0 mu m did not lead to
   further decrease in the D-B transition temperature. The tensile modulus,
   yield strength, and elongation at yield improved with increasing MMT
   content and masterbatch ratio while elongation at break was reduced. The
   modified Mori-Tanaka model showed better fit to experimental modulus
   when the effect of MMT and elastomer are considered individually.
   Overall, extruder-made nanocomposites showed balanced properties of
   PP/PP-g-MA/MMT/EOR blend nanocomposites compared with nanocomposites of
   reactor-made TPO. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part B:

Abstract = {{In situ capping is a remedial approach for reducing the risk of biota
   exposure to sediment contaminants. Biotransformation of contaminants in
   sand-based sediment caps, rarely considered in sediment cap design,
   could further reduce the exposure risk. The anaerobic biotransformation
   of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEX), monochlorobenzene,
   dichlorobenzenes and naphthalene was evaluated with sediments from
   Onondaga Lake in dilute sediment slurries and in sand-capped sediment
   laboratory-scale columns. The percentage of sediment samples
   demonstrating biotransformation under anaerobic conditions in slurries
   incubated at 12 degrees C was greatest for BTEX, followed by
   monochlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and
   1,3-dichlorobenzene. Only toluene biotransformation was observed in sand
   cap columns. The rate of toluene biotransformation diminished over time,
   which might be due to inhibition caused by hydrogen from the
   experimental setup. Results suggest potential for the biotransformation
   of toluene, and possibly other pollutants, in sand-based sediment caps
   under anaerobic conditions at low temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{In designing a direct methanol fuel cell and evaluating the
   appropriateness of new materials for inclusion, it is helpful to
   consider the impact of material properties on the performance of a
   complete system: to some degree, poor fuel utilization and performance
   losses from methanol crossover can be mitigated by proper system design.
   Simple engineering models can be useful tools in facilitating this type
   of system design. In this paper, an analytical model is developed to
   determine the oxygen concentration profile in the cathode backing layer
   and flow channel along a one-dimensional cross-section of the fuel cell.
   An existing analytical model is then used to determine the methanol
   concentration profile in the anode backing layer and membrane and the
   methanol crossover current along the same cross-section. Applying a
   fixed cell potential and using Tafel kinetics to describe the
   charge-transfer reactions at the anode and the cathode, the local
   current density and the rates of methanol and oxygen consumption are
   determined. The process repeats for a fixed number of cross-sections
   down the entire length of the flow channels, and the average current
   density and stoichiometric ratios are calculated at the end. The model
   is applied to examine the effects of new low-crossover membranes and to
   suggest new design parameters for those membranes. Also, an analysis is
   presented in which the tradeoff between stack power and the size of
   system components is examined for a range of methanol and oxygen flow
   rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8-xO6-delta (x = 0.1 or 0.2) cubic perovskites are
   confirmed to be mixed-valent Co3+/Co2+ oxides that, as mixed oxide-ion
   and electronic conductors, are superior cathode materials for an
   intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell catalyzing the
   oxygen-reduction reaction. Neutron powder diffraction for x = 0.2 was
   used to confirm also that these compounds have the double-perovskite
   structure Ba2BB'O6-delta at room temperature with B = Co, B' =
   Bi0.2Sc0.2Co0.6, delta approximate to 1.3, and a B-O bond length a
   little longer than the mean B'-O bond length. These data indicate that
   the room-temperature x = 0.2 phase is Ba2Co2+B'O-4.7 with B' =
   (Bi5+)(0.2)(Sc3+)(0.2)(Co3+)(0.6). The presence of Bi5+ was confirmed by
   comparing the Bi4f core-level X-ray photoelectron spectrum of the x =
   0.2 sample with that of BaBiO3. BaCoO3 crystallizes in the 2H hexagonal
   polytype as a result of t  (A-O)/{[}root 2(B-O)] > 1, where A-O and B-O
   are the equilibrium bond lengths of an ABO(3) perovskite. Substitution
   of Bi and Sc for Co as well as the incorporation of oxygen vacancies
   increases the mean B-O bond length to reduce t > 1 to where cubic
   stacking of close-packed BaO3 planes is energetically favored over
   hexagonal stacking that introduces large B-cation Coulombic repulsions
   across a shared octahedral-site face. Cooperative oxygen displacements
   that create larger B-O than B'-O mean bond length are characteristic of
   oxide ions in a cubic perovskite with geometric tolerance factor t > 1
   as illustrated by ferroelectric BaTiO3. Disordering of the
   double-perovskite oxide-ion displacements occurs over the range 350-400
   degrees C; long-range, frustrated magnetic order occurs below a T-c
   approximate to 35 K. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show the
   absence of low-spin Co3+ at room temperature, and the rate-limiting step
   of the oxygen-reduction reaction on these oxides acting as cathodes of a
   solid oxide fuel cell is shown to be electron transfer from the oxide to
   an adsorbed O-2, which we conjecture occurs at surface intermediate-spin
   Co3+ ions.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating block copolymer self-assembly with existing lithography
   processes to enhance their patterning capability is a promising approach
   for manufacturing a variety of semiconductor devices and next-generation
   magnetic storage media. Sub-10 nm block copolymer domains are
   specifically targeted in many of these applications, yet there are
   relatively few block copolymers that can achieve these dimensions: Here
   the synthesis and self-assembly characteristics of a new block copolymer
   poly(trimethylsilylstyrene-b-D,L-lactide) (PTMSS-b-PLA) capable of
   forming domains as small as similar to 5 rim are described. Several
   lamellar and cylinder forming diblocks were synthesized with bulk domain
   periodicities of 12-15 nm which are among the smallest domains yet
   reported for any neat block copolymer. Such small domains are possible
   because this new material has a large segment segment interaction
   parameter which is an order of magnitude higher than
   poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) and twice as large as
   poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) (PS-b-PDMS), two commonly studied
   polymers for these applications. Furthermore, the PTMSS-b-PLA blocks
   have glass transitions Well above room temperature with a large reactive
   Ion etch rite contrast between them (similar to 28) which is at least 4
   times greater than PS-b-PMMA due to incorporation of a trimethylsilyl
   group into the styrene Monomer.}},

   cylindrical and spherical morphologies in blends in which the B and C

Title = {{Spreading and convective dissolution of carbon dioxide in vertically
   confined, horizontal aquifers}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) into saline aquifers is a promising
   tool for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. At reservoir conditions,
   the injected CO2 is buoyant relative to the ambient groundwater. The
   buoyant plume of CO2 rises toward the top of the aquifer and spreads
   laterally as a gravity current, presenting the risk of leakage into
   shallower formations via a fracture or fault. In contrast, the mixture
   that forms as the CO2 dissolves into the ambient water is denser than
   the water and sinks, driving a convective process that enhances CO2
   dissolution and promotes stable long-term storage. Motivated by this
   problem, we study convective dissolution from a buoyant gravity current
   as it spreads along the top of a vertically confined, horizontal
   aquifer. We conduct laboratory experiments with analog fluids (water and
   a mixture of methanol and ethylene glycol) and compare the experimental
   results with simple theoretical models. Since the aquifer has a finite
   thickness, dissolved buoyant fluid accumulates along the bottom of the
   aquifer, and this mixture spreads laterally as a dense gravity current.
   When dissolved buoyant fluid accumulates slowly, our experiments show
   that the spreading of the buoyant current is characterized by a
   parabola-like advance and retreat of its leading edge. When dissolved
   buoyant fluid accumulates quickly, the retreat of the leading edge slows
   as further dissolution is controlled by the slumping of the dense
   gravity current. We show that simple theoretical models predict this
   behavior in both limits, where the accumulation of dissolved buoyant
   fluid is either negligible or dominant. Finally, we apply one of these
   models to a plume of CO2 in a saline aquifer. We show that the
   accumulation of dissolved CO2 in the water can increase the maximum
   extent of the CO2 plume by several fold and the lifetime of the CO2
   plume by several orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on the study of acoustic metasurface cloaking,
   based on the use of appropriate ultrathin pseudosurfaces that may act as
   cloaking devices for a finite range of frequencies. The technique
   consists in tailoring the appropriate acoustic surface impedance which
   cancels the scattered field of a diffracting spherical obstacle placed
   in the trajectory of an impinging acoustical wave. Our numerical
   simulations of both near and far fields show a significant reduction of
   scattering cross section for a moderately broad range of frequencies,
   confirming the effectiveness of surface cloaks (easier to manufacture
   and less cumbersome than their bulk counterpart). We also go one step
   further by proposing a realistic structure obtained by quasiperiodically
   patterning the surface of a spherical layer. The effective properties of
   the metasurface are obtained in the framework of homogenization theory
   and confirm this realistic route to surface cloaking for acoustic waves.}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{We study the gas flow processes in ultra-tight porous media in which the
   matrix pore network is composed of nanometre- to micrometre-size pores.
   We formulate a pressure-dependent permeability function, referred to as
   the apparent permeability function (APF), assuming that Knudsen
   diffusion and slip flow (the Klinkenberg effect) are the main
   contributors to the overall flow in porous media. The APF predicts that
   in nanometre-size pores, gas permeability values are as much as 10 times
   greater than results obtained by continuum hydrodynamics predictions,
   and with increasing pore size (i.e. of the order of the micrometre), gas
   permeability converges to continuum hydrodynamics values. In addition,
   the APF predicts that an increase in the fractal dimension of the pore
   surface leads to a decrease in Knudsen diffusion. Using the
   homogenization method, a rigorous analysis is performed to examine
   whether the APF is preserved throughout the process of upscaling from
   local scale to large scale. We use the well-known pulse-decay experiment
   to estimate the main parameter of the APF, which is Darcy permeability.
   Our newly derived late-transient analytical solution and the
   late-transient numerical solution consistently match the pressure decay
   data and yield approximately the same estimated value for Darcy
   permeability at the typical core-sample initial pressure range and
   pressure difference. Other parameters of the APF may be determined from
   independent laboratory experiments; however, a pulse-decay experiment
   can be used to estimate the unknown parameters of the APF if multiple
   tests are performed and/or the parameters are strictly constrained by
   upper and lower bounds.}},

Abstract = {{Block copolymers (BCPs) must necessarily have high interaction
   parameters (chi), a fundamental measure of block incompatibility, to
   self-assemble into sub-10-nanometer features. Unfortunately, a high chi
   often results from blocks that have disparate interfacial energies,
   which makes the formation of useful thin-film domain orientations
   challenging. To mitigate interfacial forces, polymers composed of maleic
   anhydride and two other components have been designed as top coats that
   can be spin-coated from basic aqueous solution in the ring-opened, acid
   salt form. When baked, the anhydride reforms and switches polarity to
   create a neutral layer enabling BCP feature alignment not possible by
   thermal annealing alone. Top coats were applied to the lamella-forming
   block copolymers poly(styrene-block-trimethylsilylstyrene-block-styrene)
   and poly(trimethylsilylstyrene-block-lactide), which were thermally
   annealed to produce perpendicular features with linewidths of 15 and 9
   nanometers, respectively.}},

   retained for the entire valence spectrum. We examine several
   pi-conjugated molecules and find that orbitals of a different character
   and symmetry require significantly different range-separation parameters
   and fractions of exact exchange. This imbalanced treatment of orbitals
   of a different nature biases the resulting eigenvalue spectra. Thus, the
   existing schemes for the tuning of range-separated hybrid functionals,
   while providing for good agreement between the highest occupied energy
   level and the first ionization potential, do not achieve accuracy
   comparable to reliable G(0)W(0) computations for the entire
   quasiparticle spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen loss can lead to high-capacity Li2MnO3-based lithium-rich layered
   cathodes. Substitution of Mn with other transition metals (Ti and Co)
   significantly affects the amount of oxygen loss and capacity during the
   first charge/discharge cycle. An explanation of these results is
   provided with density functional theory (DFT+U) electronic structure
   calculations. Oxygen is found to bind more strongly to Ti and more
   weakly to Co. The influence of the substitution is attributed to changes
   of the band gap. Ti lifts the nonbonding band and increases the band gap
   of the compound, thus raising the energy required to redistribute the
   electrons released upon oxygen loss. Co lowers the nonbonding band and
   facilitates oxygen loss.}},

   Ta-incorporated TiO2 (Ta:TiO2) nanowire (NW) arrays and their
   application as photoanodes for water photooxidation. Tantalum is
   incorporated into TiO2 NWs with concentrations ranging from C.11 to 3.47
   atomic \% by a simple solvothermal synthesis. N,Ta:TiO2 nanowires are
   prepared via nitridation of Ta:TiO2 nanowires in NH3 flow at a
   relatively low temperature (500 degrees C). N,Ta:TiO2 NWs with the
   optimum Ta concentration of 0.29 atomic \% also demonstrate significant
   enhancement in photoelectrochemical performance with the photocurrent
   reaching 0.52 and 0.18 mA/cm(2) under AM 1.5 G and visible sight (>420
   nm) illumination, compared with 0.26 and 0.13 mA/cm(2) for that of
   N:TiO2 NWs, although the active spectrum of the N,Ta:TiO2 NW sample only
   extends to similar to 520 nm (2.38 eV), compared to similar to 540 nm
   (2.30 eV) for N:TiO2 NWs. We believe that the enhancement shown by the
   N,Ta-coincorporated sample is due to fewer recombination centers from
   charge compensation effects and suppression of the formation of an
   amorphous layer on the nanowires during the nitridation process.}},

Abstract = {{Both urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) are frequently used as
   protein denaturants. Given that proteins generally adopt extended or
   unfolded conformations in either aqueous urea or GdmCl, one might expect
   that the unfolded protein chains will remain or become further extended
   due to the addition of another denaturant However, a collapse of
   denatured proteins is revealed using atomistic molecular dynamics
   simulations when a mixture of denaturants is used. Both hen egg-white
   lysozyme and protein L are found to undergo collapse in the denaturant
   mixture. The collapse of the protein conformational ensembles is
   accompanied by a decreased solubility and increased non-native
   self-interactions of hydrophobic residues in the urea/GdmCl mixture. The
   increase of non-native interactions rather than the native contacts
   indicates that the proteins experience a simple collapse transition from
   the fully denatured states. During the protein collapse, the relatively
   stronger denaturant GdmCl displays a higher tendency to be absorbed onto
   the protein surface due to their stronger electrostatic interactions
   with proteins. At the same time, urea molecules also accumulate near the
   protein surface, resulting in an enhanced ``local crowding{''} for the
   protein near its first solvation shell. This rearrangement of
   denaturants near the protein surface and crowded local environment
   induce the protein collapse, mainly by burying their hydrophobic
   residues. These findings from molecular simulations are then further
   explained by a simple analytical model based on statistical mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous chlorine solutions (defined as chlorine solutions (Cl-2,Cl-T)
   containing solely or a combination of molecular chlorine (Cl-2),
   hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and hypochlorite (OCl-)) are known to produce
   toxic inorganic disinfection byproduct (e.g., chlorate and chlorite)
   through photoactivated transformations. Recent reports of perchlorate
   (ClO4-) production-a well-known thyroid hormone disruptor from stored
   bleach solutions indicates the presence of unexplored transformation
   pathway(s). The evaluation of this potential ClO4- source is important
   given the widespread use of aqueous chlorine as a disinfectant. In this
   study, we perform detailed rate analysis of ClO4- generation from
   aqueous chlorine under varying environmental conditions including
   ultraviolet (UV) light sources, intensity, solution pH, and Cl-2,Cl-T
   concentrations. Our results show that ClO4- is produced upon UV exposure
   of aqueous chlorine solutions with yields ranging from 0.09 x 10(-3) to
   9.2 x 10(-3)\% for all experimental conditions. The amount of ClO4-
   produced depends on the starting concentrations of Cl-2,Cl-T and ClO3-,
   UV source wavelength, and solution pH, but it is independent of light
   intensity. We hypothesize a mechanistic pathway derived from known
   reactions of Cl-2,Cl-T photodecomposition that involves the reaction of
   Cl radicals with ClO3- to produce ClO4- with calculated rate coefficient
   (k(ClO4-)) of (4-40) x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) and (3-250) x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) for
   UV-B/C and UV-A, respectively. The measured ClO4- concentrations for
   both UV-B and UV-C experiments agreed well with our model (R-2 =
   0.88-0.99), except under UV-A light exposure (R-2 = 0.52-0.93),
   suggesting the possible involvement of additional pathways at higher
   wavelengths. Based on our results, phototransformation of aqueous
   chlorine solutions at concentrations relevant to drinking water
   treatment would result in ClO4- concentrations (similar to 0.1 mu g L-1)
   much below the proposed drinking water limits. The importance of the
   hypothesized mechanism is discussed in relation to natural ClO4-
   formation by atmospheric transformations.}},

Title = {{Computational analysis of thin film InGaAs/GaAs quantum well solar cells

Abstract = {{Simulations of thin film (similar to 2.5 mu m thick) InGaAs/GaAs quantum
   well solar cells with various back side reflective and planar, symmetric
   scattering structures used for light trapping have been performed using
   rigorous coupled-wave analysis. Two-dimensional periodic
   metal/dielectric scattering structures were numerically optimized for
   Airmass 0 photocurrent generation for each device structure. The
   simulation results indicate that the absorption spectra of devices with
   both reflective and scattering structures are largely determined by the
   Fabry-Perot resonance characteristics of the thin film device structure.
   The scattering structures substantially increase absorption in the
   quantum wells at wavelengths longer than the GaAs absorption edge
   through a combination of coupling to modes of the thin film device
   structures and by reducing parasitic metal absorption compared to planar
   metal reflectors. For Airmass 0 illumination and 100\% carrier
   collection, the estimated short-circuit current density of devices with
   In0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs quantum wells improves by up to 4.6 mA/cm(2) (15\%)
   relative to a GaAs homojunction device, with the improvement resulting
   approximately equally from scattering of light into thin film modes and
   reduction of metal absorption compared to a planar reflective layer. (C)

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The limitations in the cathode capacity compared with that of the anode
   have been an impediment to advance the lithium-ion battery technology.
   The lithium-sulphur system is appealing in this regard, as sulphur
   exhibits an order of magnitude higher capacity than the currently used
   cathodes. However, low active material utilization and poor cycle life
   hinder the practicality of lithium-sulphur batteries. Here we report a
   simple adjustment to the traditional lithium-sulphur battery
   configuration to achieve high capacity with a long cycle life and rapid
   charge rate. With a bifunctional microporous carbon paper between the
   cathode and separator, we observe a significant improvement not only in
   the active material utilization but also in capacity retention, without
   involving complex synthesis or surface modification. The insertion of a
   microporous carbon interlayer decreases the internal charge transfer
   resistance and localizes the soluble polysulphide species, facilitating
   a commercially feasible means of fabricating the lithium-sulphur
   batteries.}},

Title = {{Optimization of Prosthetic Foot Stiffness to Reduce Metabolic Cost and
   Intact Knee Loading During Below-Knee Amputee Walking: A Theoretical
   Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Unilateral below-knee amputees develop abnormal gait characteristics
   that include bilateral asymmetries and an elevated metabolic cost
   relative to non-amputees. In addition, long-term prosthesis use has been
   linked to an increased prevalence of joint pain and osteoarthritis in
   the intact leg knee. To improve amputee mobility, prosthetic feet that
   utilize elastic energy storage and return (ESAR) have been designed,
   which perform important biomechanical functions such as providing body
   support and forward propulsion. However, the prescription of appropriate
   design characteristics (e. g., stiffness) is not well-defined since its
   influence on foot function and important in vivo biomechanical
   quantities such as metabolic cost and joint loading remain unclear. The
   design of feet that improve these quantities could provide considerable
   advancements in amputee care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
   to couple design optimization with dynamic simulations of amputee
   walking to identify the optimal foot stiffness that minimizes metabolic
   cost and intact knee joint loading. A musculoskeletal model and
   distributed stiffness ESAR prosthetic foot model were developed to
   generate muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations of amputee
   walking. Dynamic optimization was used to solve for the optimal muscle
   excitation patterns and foot stiffness profile that produced simulations
   that tracked experimental amputee walking data while minimizing
   metabolic cost and intact leg internal knee contact forces. Muscle and
   foot function were evaluated by calculating their contributions to the
   important walking subtasks of body support, forward propulsion and leg
   swing. The analyses showed that altering a nominal prosthetic foot
   stiffness distribution by stiffening the toe and mid-foot while making
   the ankle and heel less stiff improved ESAR foot performance by
   offloading the intact knee during early to mid-stance of the intact leg
   and reducing metabolic cost. The optimal design also provided moderate
   braking and body support during the first half of residual leg stance,
   while increasing the prosthesis contributions to forward propulsion and
   body support during the second half of residual leg stance. Future work
   will be directed at experimentally validating these results, which have
   important implications for future designs of prosthetic feet that could
   significantly improve amputee care. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007824]}},

Abstract = {{Nonmiscible fluid displacement without salt exchange takes place when
   oil-base mud (OBM) invades connate water-saturated rocks. This is a
   favorable condition for the estimation of dynamic petrophysical
   properties, including saturation-dependent capillary pressure. We
   developed and successfully tested a new method to estimate porosity,
   fluid saturation, permeability, capillary pressure, and relative
   permeability of water-bearing sands invaded with OBM from multiple
   borehole geophysical measurements. The estimation method simulates the
   process of mud-filtrate invasion to calculate the corresponding radial
   distribution of water saturation. Porosity, permeability, capillary
   pressure, and relative permeability are iteratively adjusted in the
   simulation of invasion until density, photoelectric factor, neutron
   porosity, and apparent resistivity logs are accurately reproduced with
   numerical simulations that honor the postinvasion radial distribution of
   water saturation. Examples of application include oil- and gas-bearing
   reservoirs that exhibit a complete capillary fluid transition between
   water at the bottom and hydrocarbon at irreducible water saturation at
   the top. We show that the estimated dynamic petrophysical properties in
   the water-bearing portion of the reservoir are in agreement with
   vertical variations of water saturation above the free water-hydrocarbon
   contact, thereby validating our estimation method. Additionally, it is
   shown that the radial distribution of water saturation inferred from
   apparent resistivity and nuclear logs can be used for fluid-substitution
   analysis of acoustic compressional and shear logs.}},

   triggers low test accuracy and serious yield loss. This brief proposes a
   novel test methodology to accurately predict individual DUT
   specifications by overcoming the imbalance problem with the imbalance
   generator, a radio-frequency transformer, and a programmable capacitor
   array based on a loopback test configuration. The imbalance generator
   produces spectral loopback responses of different weight. Nonlinear
   equations are then derived to characterize DUT specifications. Hardware

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated the deposition of EuO films on graphene by reactive
   molecular beam epitaxy in a special adsorption-controlled and
   oxygen-limited regime, which is a critical advance toward the
   realization of the exchange proximity interaction (EPI). It has been
   predicted that when the ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) EuO is brought
   into contact with graphene, an overlap of electronic wave functions at
   the FMI/graphene interface can induce a large spin splitting inside the
   graphene. Experimental realization of this effect could lead to new
   routes for spin manipulation, which is a necessary requirement for a
   functional spin transistor. Furthermore, EPI could lead to novel
   spintronic behavior such as controllable magnetoresistance, gate tunable
   exchange bias, and quantized anomalous Hall effect. However,
   experimentally, EuO has not yet been integrated onto graphene. Here we
   report the successful growth of high-quality crystalline EuO on highly
   oriented pyrolytic graphite and single-layer graphene. The epitaxial EuO
   layers have (001) orientation and do not induce an observable D peak
   (defect) in the Raman spectra. Magneto-optic measurements indicate
   ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of 69 K, which is the value for
   bulk EuO. Transport measurements on exfoliated graphene before and after
   EuO deposition indicate only a slight decrease in mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Two different nondestructive test (NDT) methods, air-coupled impact-echo
   (IE) and infrared (IR) thermography are evaluated on a full-scale
   simulated reinforced concrete bridge deck containing simulated
   delamination and cracking defects. The IE data are presented as
   two-dimensional frequency maps and spectral B-scan lines. The IR data
   are presented as temperature maps on the concrete surface. The lateral
   boundaries of the detected delaminations are also indicated in the
   images. The results obtained from each of the individual NDT methods
   show reasonably good agreement with most of the actual defects. The
   advantages and limitations of each method to characterize defects are
   discussed. The consistency and sensitivity of each method are also
   investigated. Finally, a simple data fusion technique is proposed to
   improve effectiveness of the individual test data. The findings from
   this study demonstrate that the combination of air-coupled IE and IR

Title = {{Link-Journey Speed Estimation for Urban Arterial Performance Measurement
   Using Advance Loop Detector Data under Congested Conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1321-1332}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Travel speed ties directly to travel time, so it is an important measure
   for quantifying arterial performance. However, accurately estimating
   link travel speed for urban arterials is difficult because of traffic
   fluctuations and stop-and-go conditions caused by signal control. This
   research proposes a two-step empirical approach to effectively estimate
   the link-journey speeds using only advance loop detector outputs. The
   first step is to estimate the spot speed on the basis of advance loop
   measurements using Athol's algorithm. The robust regression technique
   can be used to calibrate the speed estimation parameter (or g-factor) in
   Athol's algorithm. The second step is to use the proposed simplified
   speed estimation model to estimate the link speed using only the
   calculated loop-spot speed without any knowledge of signal timing plans.
   Traffic operations in the central business district of the City of
   Bellevue, Washington, are simulated in the VISSIM traffic simulation
   model. The test results show that only 50 cycles of data are needed to
   calibrate the g-factor in loop-speed estimation and the same datasets
   can be used to calibrate the proposed link-speed model. Using this
   model, the average mean absolute error over the study links is reduced
   from 4.24 to 1.51 mph. With proper calibration, this average error can
   be further reduced to 0.91 mph. The results are encouraging and
   satisfactory. The results also show that the accuracy of speed
   estimation may be further increased when more data are applied for
   calibration. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000429. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Unsteady flows in Io's atmosphere caused by condensation and sublimation
   during and after eclipse: Numerical study based on a model Boltzmann
   equation}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{221}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of Io's atmosphere during and after eclipse is investigated
   on the basis of kinetic theory. The atmosphere is mainly composed of
   sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas, which condenses to or sublimates from the
   frost of SO2 on the surface depending on the variation of surface
   temperature (similar to 90-114 K). The atmosphere may also contain a
   noncondensable gas, such as sulfur monoxide (SO) or oxygen (O-2), as a
   minor component. In the present study, an accurate numerical analysis
   for a model Boltzmann equation by a finite-difference method is
   performed for a one-dimensional atmosphere, and the detailed structure
   of unsteady gas flows caused by the phase transition of SO2 is
   clarified. For instance, the following scenario is obtained. The
   condensation of SO2 on the surface, starting when eclipse begins, gives
   rise to a downward flow of the atmosphere. The falling atmosphere then
   bounces upward when colliding with the lower atmosphere but soon falls
   again. This process of falling and bounce back of the atmosphere repeats
   during the eclipse, resulting in a temporal oscillation of the
   macroscopic quantities, such as the velocity and temperature, at a fixed
   altitude. For a pure SO2 atmosphere, the amplitude of the oscillation is
   large because of a fast downward flow, but the oscillation decays
   rapidly. In contrast, for a mixture, the downward flow is slow because
   the noncondensable gas adjacent to the surface hinders the condensation
   of SO2. The oscillation in this case is weak but lasts much longer than
   in the case of pure SO2. The present paper is complementary to the work
   by Moore et al. (Moore, C.H., Goldstein, D.B., Varghese, P.L., Trafton,
   L.M., Stewart, B. {[}2009]. Icarus 201,585-597) using the direct

Title = {{Pressure and partial wetting effects on superhydrophobic friction
   reduction in microchannel flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Friction reduction in microchannel flows can help alleviate the
   inherently taxing pumping power requirements associated with the
   dimensions involved. One possible way of achieving friction reduction is
   through the introduction of surface microtexturing that can lead to a
   superhydrophobic Cassie-Baxter state. The Cassie-Baxter state is
   characterized by the presence of air pockets within the surface
   microtexturing believed to act as an effective ``shear free{''} (or at
   least shear reduced) layer, decreasing the overall friction
   characteristics of the surface. Most work in this area has concentrated
   on optimizing the surface microtexturing geometry to maximize the
   friction reduction effects and overall stability of the Cassie-Baxter
   state. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of partially
   wetted conditions induced by pressure and the correlation between the
   liquid-gas interface location within the surface microtexturing and the
   microchannel flow characteristics. This is mainly attributed to the
   difficulty in tracking the interface shape and location within the
   microtexturing in the typical top-down view arrangements used in most
   studies. In this paper, a rectangular microchannel with regular
   microtexturing on the sidewalls is used to visualize and track the
   location of the air-water interface within the roughness elements. While
   visually tracking the wetting conditions in the microtextures, pressure
   drops versus flow rates for each microchannel are measured and analyzed
   in terms of the non-dimensional friction coefficient. The frictional
   behavior of the Poiseuille flow suggests that (1) the air-water
   interface more closely resembles a no-slip boundary rather than a
   shear-free one, (2) the friction is rather insensitive to the degree of
   microtexturing wetting, and (3) the fully wetted (Wenzel state)
   microtexturing provides lower friction than the non-wetted one (Cassie
   state), in corroboration with observations (1) and (2). (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Recently, we have introduced a mechanism to achieve ultrabroadband light
   funnelling and total transmission through 1D narrow metallic gratings at
   a specific incidence angle, the so-called plasmonic Brewster angle. This
   phenomenon is based on impedance matching between the guided modes
   supported by ultranarrow linear slits and transverse-magnetic waves at
   oblique incidence. In this paper, we demonstrate that such phenomenon,
   representing the equivalent of Brewster transmission for plasmonic
   screens, can also occur in 2D metallic gratings of various structural
   forms and shapes, and that it may be made insensitive to the azimuthal,
   or polarization, angle phi. This finding may have relevant implications
   to realize large funneling, absorption and squeezing of light in
   perforated metallic screens. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{An understanding of molecular interactions is essential for insight into
   biological systems at the molecular scale. Among the various components
   of molecular interactions, electrostatics are of special importance
   because of their long-range nature and their influence on polar or
   charged molecules, including water, aqueous ions, proteins, nucleic
   acids, carbohydrates, and membrane lipids. In particular, robust models
   of electrostatic interactions are essential for understanding the
   solvation properties of biomolecules and the effects of solvation upon
   biomolecular folding, binding, enzyme catalysis, and dynamics.
   Electrostatics, therefore, are of central importance to understanding
   biomolecular structure and modeling interactions within and among
   biological molecules. This review discusses the solvation of
   biomolecules with a computational biophysics view toward describing the
   phenomenon. While our main focus lies on the computational aspect of the
   models, we provide an overview of the basic elements of biomolecular
   solvation (e.g. solvent structure, polarization, ion binding, and
   non-polar behavior) in order to provide a background to understand the
   different types of solvation models.}},

Abstract = {{A sulfur carbon nanocomposite consisting of a commercial
   high-surface-area carbon (i.e., Black Pearls 2000, BET surface area
   >1000 m(2) g(-1)) and sulfur has been synthesized by an in situ
   deposition method. The nanocomposite is in the form of agglomerated
   nanoparticles, with the micropores within the carbon filled with sulfur
   and the mesopores on the carbon surface almost completely covered by
   sulfur. The BET surface area of the nanocomposite containing a sulfur
   content of 63.5 wt \% is significantly reduced to only 40 m(2) g(-1).
   Cathodes containing the nanocomposite and Pluronic F427 block copolymer,
   which partially replaces the polyvinylidene fluoride binder, were
   prepared and evaluated in lithium cells by cyclic voltammetry and
   galvanostatic cycling. The nanocomposite cathodes with the copolymer
   show improved electrochemical stability and cyclability. The Pluronic
   copolymer helps retain a uniform nanocomposite structure within the
   electrodes, improving the electrochemical contact, which was manifested
   by scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy. The sulfur-Black Pearls nanocomposite with the Pluronic
   copolymer as an additive in the electrodes is promising for high-rate
   rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss and analyze the design of a high-frequency,

   field-emission nanotriodes (FENT) consisting of self-aligned gate around

   model to characterize dc properties of individual FENTs and a
   transmission-line circuit for evaluating and optimizing relevant ac
   properties, including power gain and impedance matching. Our discussion
   starts from the FENT array's dc characteristics and covers its radio
   frequency and microwave properties, considering effects of array
   density, geometry, FENT dimensions, and nanoemitter work function, in
   order to maximize power gain and bandwidth for high-frequency
   applications (30100 GHz). Finally, we consider the practical design of a
   transmitter front end for wireless systems, combining the FENT-array DA
   with a tapered open-ended waveguide antenna, significantly improving
   matching and power radiation efficiency. Our results are of interest for
   imaging, sensing, satellite communications, defense, and security at 94

Title = {{Are QCA Cryptographic Circuits Resistant to Power Analysis Attack?}},

Abstract = {{Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) technology is expected to offer fast
   computation performance, high density, and low power consumption. Thus,
   researchers believe that QCA may be an attractive alternative to CMOS
   for future digital designs. Side channel attacks, such as power analysis
   attacks, have become a significant threat to the security of CMOS
   cryptographic circuits. A power analysis attack can reveal the secret
   key from measurements of the power consumption during the encryption and
   decryption process. As there is no electric current flow in QCA
   technology, the power consumption of QCA circuits is extremely low when
   compared to their CMOS counterparts. Therefore, in this paper an
   investigation into both the best and worst case scenarios for attackers
   is carried out to ascertain if QCA circuits are immune to power analysis
   attack. A QCA design of a submodule of the Serpent cipher is proposed.
   In comparison to a previous design, the proposed design is more
   efficient in terms of complexity, area, and latency. By using an upper
   bound power model, the first power analysis attack of a QCA
   cryptographic circuit is presented. The simulation results show that
   even though the power consumption is low, it can still be correlated
   with the correct key guess, and all possible subkeys applied to the
   Serpent submodule can be revealed in the best case scenario. Therefore,
   in theory QCA cryptographic circuits would be vulnerable to power
   analysis attack. However, the security of practical QCA devices can be
   greatly improved by applying a smoother clock. Moreover, in the worst
   case scenario, the design of logically reversible QCA circuits with
   Bennett clocking could be used as a natural countermeasure to power
   analysis attack. Therefore, it is believed that QCA could be a niche
   technology in the future for the implementation of security
   architectures resistant to power analysis attack.}},

Abstract = {{Test case prioritization is used in regression testing to schedule the
   execution order of test cases so as to expose faults earlier in testing.
   Over the past few years, many test case prioritization techniques have
   been proposed in the literature. Most of these techniques require data
   on dynamic execution in the form of code coverage information for test
   cases. However, the collection of dynamic code coverage information on
   test cases has several associated drawbacks including cost increases and
   reduction in prioritization precision. In this paper, we propose an
   approach to prioritizing test cases in the absence of coverage
   information that operates on Java programs tested under the JUnit
   framework-an increasingly popular class of systems. Our approach, JUnit
   test case Prioritization Techniques operating in the Absence of coverage
   information (JUPTA), analyzes the static call graphs of JUnit test cases
   and the program under test to estimate the ability of each test case to
   achieve code coverage, and then schedules the order of these test cases
   based on those estimates. To evaluate the effectiveness of JUPTA, we
   conducted an empirical study on 19 versions of four Java programs
   ranging from 2K-80K lines of code, and compared several variants of
   JUPTA with three control techniques, and several other existing dynamic
   coverage-based test case prioritization techniques, assessing the
   abilities of the techniques to increase the rate of fault detection of
   test suites. Our results show that the test suites constructed by JUPTA
   are more effective than those in random and untreated test orders in
   terms of fault-detection effectiveness. Although the test suites
   constructed by dynamic coverage-based techniques retain fault-detection
   effectiveness advantages, the fault-detection effectiveness of the test
   suites constructed by JUPTA is close to that of the test suites
   constructed by those techniques, and the fault-detection effectiveness
   of the test suites constructed by some of JUPTA's variants is better
   than that of the test suites constructed by several of those techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Interference alignment (IA) is a cooperative transmission strategy that,
   under some conditions, achieves the interference channel's maximum
   number of degrees of freedom. Realizing IA gains, however, is contingent
   upon providing transmitters with sufficiently accurate channel
   knowledge. In this paper, we study the performance of IA in
   multiple-input multiple-output systems where channel knowledge is
   acquired through training and analog feedback. We design the training
   and feedback system to maximize IA's effective sum-rate: a
   non-asymptotic performance metric that accounts for estimation error,
   training and feedback overhead, and channel selectivity. We characterize
   effective sum-rate with overhead in relation to various parameters such
   as signal-to-noise ratio, Doppler spread, and feedback channel quality.
   A main insight from our analysis is that, by properly designing the CSI
   acquisition process, IA can provide good sum-rate performance in a very
   wide range of fading scenarios. Another observation from our work is
   that such overhead-aware analysis can help solve a number of practical
   network design problems. To demonstrate the concept of overhead-aware
   network design, we consider the example problem of finding the optimal
   number of cooperative IA users based on signal power and mobility.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional wireless protocols, medium-access-control and

   based on this single cross-layer framework. Q-CMRA's distributed

   medium-access and rate-allocation. Such joint control is essential to
   improving spatial-reuse and total network throughput. In our

Abstract = {{We report processing unit (GPU) and Open-MP parallel implementations of
   water specific force calculations and of bond constraints for use in
   molecular dynamics simulation's. We focus on a typical laboratory
   computing environment in which a CPU with a few cores is attached to a
   GPU. We discuss in detail the design of the code, and we illustrate
   performance comparable to highly optimized codes such as GROMACS.
   Besides speed, our code shows excellent energy conservation. Utilization
   of water specific lists allows the efficient calculations of nonbonded
   interactions that include water molecules and results in a speed-up
   factor of more than 40 on the GPU compared to code optimized on a single
   CPU core for systems larger than 20 000 atoms. This is up 4-fold from a
   factor of 10 reported in our initial GPU implementation that did not
   include a water specific code. Another optimization is the
   implementation of constrained dynamics entirely on the GPU. The routine,
   which enforces Constraints of all bonds,. runs in parallel on multiple
   Open MP cores or entirely on the GPU. It is based on the conjugate
   gradient Solution of the Lagrange multipliers (CG SHAKE). The GPU
   implementation is partially in double precision and requires no
   communication with the CPU during the execution of the SHAKE algorithm.
   The (parallel) implementation of SHAKE allows an increase of the time
   step to 2.0 fs while maintaining excellent energy conservation.
   Interestingly, CG SHAKE is faster than the usual bond relaxation
   algorithm even on a single core if high accuracy is expected. The
   significant speedup of the optimized components transfers the
   computational bottleneck of the MD: calculation to the reciprocal part
   of particle mesh Ewald (PME).}},

Abstract = {{A new electric propulsion device concept takes advantage of residual
   helium gas that is trapped in the chemical propellant feed system and
   currently unused at end of life. The helium ion thruster provides
   additional propellant resources to extend satellite lifetimes and
   transfer geostationary orbit space assets to ultrasafe disposal orbits.
   The predicted capability, if fully allotted to the disposal, allows for
   perigee heights above the geostationary altitude that are one order of
   magnitude greater than existing international guidelines of similar to
   250 km. Furthermore, the proposed helium ion thruster concept makes the
   classic propellant gauge uncertainty problem moot, as satellite
   operators could use all of their conventional propellant for nominal
   station-keeping operations. The helium ion thruster concept therefore
   mitigates future space debris arising from depleted assets in the
   geostationary orbit belt through both aggressive orbit raising and
   depressurization of satellites at end of life. An analysis of the helium
   ion thruster theoretical performance shows that the device could raise
   the altitude of an end-of-life 2500 kg, 5 kW spacecraft by 2200 km in
   two months using 2 kg of residual helium.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful
   electrochemical technique to detect biomolecules. EIS has the potential
   of carrying out label-free and real-time detection, and in addition, can
   be easily implemented using electronic integrated circuits (ICs) that
   are built through standard semiconductor fabrication processes. This
   paper focuses on the various design and optimization aspects of EIS ICs,
   particularly the bio-to-semiconductor interface design. We discuss, in
   detail, considerations such as the choice of the electrode surface in
   view of IC manufacturing, surface linkers, and development of optimal
   bio-molecular detection protocols. We also report experimental results,
   using both macro-and micro-electrodes to demonstrate the design
   trade-offs and ultimately validate our optimization procedures.}},

Abstract = {{It been known for nearly a half century that human tumors, including
   those derived from the nervous system such as glioblastomas,
   medulloblastoma, and neuroblastomas are much more sensitive than normal
   tissues to L-methionine (L-Met)starvation. More recently, systemic L-Met
   depletion by administration of Pseudomonas putida methionine-gamma-lyase
   (MGL) could effectively inhibit human tumors xenografted in mice.
   However, bacterial-derived MGLs are unstable in serum (t(1/2) = 1.9 +/-
   0.2 h) and highly immunogenic in primates. Since the human genome does
   not encode a human MGL enzyme, we created de novo a methionine degrading
   enzyme by : reengineering the structurally homologous pyridoxal
   phosphate-dependent human enzyme cystathionine-gamma-lyase (hCGL). hCGL
   degrades L-cystathionine but displays no promiscuous activity toward
   L-Met. Rational design and scanning saturation mutagenesis led to the
   generation of a variant containing three amino acid substitutions
   (hCGL-NLV) that degraded L-Met with a k(cat)/K-M of 5.6 x 10(2) M-1
   s(-1) and displayed a serum deactivation t(1/2) = 78 +/- 5 h
   (non-PEGylated). In vitro, the cytotoxicity of hCGL-NLV toward 14
   neuroblastoma cell lines was essentially indistinguishable from that of
   the P. putida MGL. Intravenous administration of PEGylated hCGL-NLV in
   mice reduced serum L-Met from 123 mu M to <5 mu M for over 30 h.
   Importantly, treatment of neuroblastoma mouse xenografts with PEGylated
   hCGL-NLV resulted in near complete cessation of tumor growth. Since the
   mode of action of hCGL-NLV does not require breaching the blood-brain
   barrier, this enzyme may have potential application for sensitive tumors
   that arise from or metastasize to the central nervous system.}},

Abstract = {{The human asparaginase-like protein 1 (hASRGL1) catalyzes the hydrolysis
   of L-asparagine and isoaspartyl-dipeptides As an N-terminal nucleophile
   (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily member, the active form of hASRGL1 is
   generated by. an intramolecular cleavage step with Thr168 as the
   catalytic residue However, in vitro, autoprocessing is incomplete
   (similar to 50\%), fettering the biophysical characterization 1 of
   hASRGL1 We circumvented this obstacle by constructing a circularly
   permuted hASRGL1 that uncoupled the autoprocessing reaction, allowing us
   to kinetically and structurally characterize this enzyme and the
   precursor like hASAGL1-Thr168Ala variant :Crystallographic and
   biochemical evidence suggest an activation mechanism where a torsional
   restraint on the Thr168 side chain helps drive the intramolecular
   processing reaction. Cleavage and formation of the active site releases
   the torsional restriction on Thr168, which is facilitated by a small
   conserved Gly-rich loop near the active site that allows the
   conformational changes necessary for activation.}},

Title = {{Manipulating JNK Signaling with (-)-Zuonin A}},
Journal = {{ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1873-1883}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recently, in a virtual screening strategy to identify new compounds
   targeting the D-recruitment site (DRS) of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases
   (JNKs), we identified the natural product (-)-zuonin A. Here we report
   the asymmetric synthesis of (-)-zuonin A and its enantiomer (+)-zuonin
   A. A kinetic analysis for the inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation by
   (-)-zuonin A revealed a mechanism of partial competitive inhibition. Its
   binding is proposed to weaken the interaction of c-Jun to JNK by
   approximately 5-fold, without affecting the efficiency of
   phosphorylation within the complex. (-)-Zuonin A inhibits the ability of
   both MKK4 and MKK7 to phosphorylate and activate JNK. The binding site
   of (-)-zuonin A is predicted by docking and molecular dynamics
   simulation to be located in the DRS of JNK. (+)-Zuonin A also binds JNK
   but barely impedes the binding of c-Jun. (-)-Zuonin A inhibits the
   activation of JNK, as well as the phosphorylation of c-Jun in
   anisomycin-treated HEK293 cells, with the inhibition of JNK activation
   being more pronounced (-)-Zuonin A also inhibits events associated with
   constitutive JNK2 activity, including c-Jun phosphorylation, basal Akt
   activation, and MDA-MB-231 cell Migration. Mutations in the predicted
   binding Site for (-)-zuonin A, can render it significantly more or less
   sensitive to inhibition than wild type JNK2, allowing for the design of
   potential chemical genetic experiments. These studies suggest that the
   biological activity reported for other lignans, Such as saucerneol F and
   zuonin B, may be the result of their, ability to impede protein-protein
   interactions within MAPK cascades}},

Abstract = {{The methods by which nuclear power's radioactive signature could be
   reduced typically require the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.
   However, economic assessments of the costs that are associated with
   doing this are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We present a
   probabilistic analysis of the costs to build, operate and decommission
   the facilities that would be required to reprocess all US spent nuclear
   fuel generated over a one hundred year time frame. starting from a 2010
   power production rate. The analysis suggests a total life-cycle cost of
   2.11 +/- 0.26 mills/kWh, with a 90\% and 99\% confidence that the
   overall cost would remain below 2.45 and 2.75 mills/kWh respectively.
   The most significant effects on cost come from the efficiency of the
   reactor fleet and the growth rate of nuclear power. The analysis shows
   that discounting results in life-cycle costs decreasing as recycling is
   delayed. However the costs to store spent fuel closely counter the
   effect of discounting when an intergenerational discount rate is used.

   microsystem integrates a two-layer soft polymer microfluidic network and

   imager consists of a 64 x 128-pixel array interdigitated with a 32 x 64
   electrolessly plated nickel-gold microelectrode array. A two-transistor
   reset path technique attenuates the subthreshold leakage current of the
   reset transistor which constitutes a significant portion of the dark
   current. An active reset technique, in-pixel flicker noise cancellation,
   and pixel binning contribute to noise reduction. The imager achieves a
   low dark current of 3.6 nA/cm(2) for photodiode reset voltages as high
   as 2.3 V, noise of 110 mu Vrms with maximum time of photon integration
   of 90 s, and a dynamic range of 67.8 dB. The CMOS-microfluidic

Abstract = {{Impact experiments conducted on custom manufactured fabrics provide a
   systematic study of the effects of weave type on ballistic performance
   for aramid, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, and hybrid aramid
   ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fabrics. For the combination of
   projectile, yarn count, and yarn denier considered, the ultrahigh
   molecular weight polyethylene and hybrid fabrics show a strong and
   similar dependence of ballistic performance on weave type. The measured
   performance of the aramid fabrics was unexpectedly insensitive to weave
   type, although variations in target ballistic performance were the
   highest in the aramid fabric experiments. The experimental approach
   developed in this research is well suited for use in measuring the
   influence of additional parameters, such as projectile type, on the
   relative ballistic performance of various two-dimensional weaves.}},

Title = {{Adsorption of surface functionalized silica nanoparticles onto mineral
   surfaces and decane/water interface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The adsorption of silica nanoparticles onto representative mineral
   surfaces and at the decane/water interface was studied. The effects of
   particle size (the mean diameters from 5 to 75 nm), concentration and
   surface type on the adsorption were studied in detail. Silica
   nanoparticles with four different surfaces {[} unmodified, surface
   modified with anionic (sulfonate), cationic (quaternary ammonium (quat))
   or nonionic (polyethylene glycol (PEG)) surfactant] were used. The zeta
   potential of these silica nanoparticles ranges from -79.8 to 15.3 mV.
   The shape of silica particles examined by a Hitachi-S5500 scanning
   transmission electron microscope (STEM) is quite spherical. The
   adsorption of all the nanoparticles (unmodified or surface modified) on
   quartz and calcite surfaces was found to be insignificant. We used
   interfacial tension (IFT) measurements to investigate the adsorption of
   silica nanoparticles at the decane/water interface. Unmodified
   nanoparticles or surface modified ones with sulfonate or quat do not
   significantly affect the IFT of the decane/water interface. It also does
   not appear that the particle size or concentration influences the IFT.
   However, the presence of PEG as a surface modifying material
   significantly reduces the IFT. The PEG surface modifier alone in an
   aqueous solution, without the nanoparticles, yields the same IFT
   reduction for an equivalent PEG concentration as that used for modifying
   the surface of nanoparticles. Contact angle measurements of a decane
   droplet on quartz or calcite plate immersed in water (or aqueous
   nanoparticle dispersion) showed a slight change in the contact angle in
   the presence of the studied nanoparticles. The results of contact angle
   measurements are in good agreement with experiments of adsorption of
   nanoparticles on mineral surfaces or decane/water interface. This study
   brings new insights into the understanding and modeling of the
   adsorption of surface-modified silica nanoparticles onto mineral
   surfaces and water/decane interface.}},

Title = {{The influence of wheelchair propulsion technique on upper extremity
   muscle demand: A simulation study}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The majority of manual wheelchair users will experience
   upper extremity injuries or pain, in part due to the high force
   requirements, repetitive motion and extreme joint postures associated
   with wheelchair propulsion. Recent studies have identified cadence,
   contact angle and peak force as important factors for reducing upper
   extremity demand during propulsion. However, studies often make
   comparisons between populations (e.g., able-bodied vs. paraplegic) or do
   not investigate specific measures of upper extremity demand. The purpose
   of this study was to use a musculoskeletal model and forward dynamics
   simulations of wheelchair propulsion to investigate how altering
   cadence, peak force and contact angle influence individual muscle
   demand.
   Methods: Forward dynamics simulations of wheelchair propulsion were
   generated to emulate group-averaged experimental data during four
   conditions: 1) self-selected propulsion technique, and while 2)
   minimizing cadence, 3) maximizing contact angle, and 4) minimizing peak
   force using biofeedback Simulations were used to determine individual
   muscle mechanical power and stress as measures of muscle demand.
   Results: Minimizing peak force and cadence had the lowest muscle power
   requirements. However, minimizing peak force increased cadence and
   recovery power, while minimizing cadence increased average muscle
   stress. Maximizing contact angle increased muscle stress and had the
   highest muscle power requirements.
   Interpretation: Minimizing cadence appears to have the most potential
   for reducing muscle demand and fatigue, which could decrease upper
   extremity injuries and pain. However, altering any of these variables to
   extreme values appears to be less effective; instead small to moderate
   changes may better reduce overall muscle demand. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND The risk of cerebrovascular embolic events with atrial
   fibrillation (AF) is potentially linked to an increased risk of
   cognitive decline and dementia. However, epidemiologic studies exploring
   the association between AF and incident dementia have reported
   conflicting results.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of
   observational studies specifically designed to evaluate the prospective
   relationship between AF and incident dementia.
   METHODS We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, BioMedCentral, Embase,
   Cardiosource, clinicaltrials. gov, and ISI Web of Science (January 1980
   to May 2012). No language restriction was applied. Two independent
   reviewers screened titles and abstracts to identify population-based
   studies that prospectively evaluated the association between AF and the
   incidence of dementia in patients not suffering an acute stroke and with
   normal cognitive function at baseline, providing the hazard ratio (HR)
   obtained in multiple Cox regression analyses, and adjusted for all
   confounding variables. Two independent reviewers assessed risk of bias
   according to the Cochrane Collaboration, and extracted patient and study
   characteristics and the adjusted HR of incident dementia with its 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) of patients with AF vs those without AF.
   RESULTS Eight studies with 77,668 patients were included in the
   analysis. All studies had a prospective observational design and
   included elderly patients (mean age range 61-84 years) with normal
   cognitive function at baseline, of whom 11,700 (15\%) had AF. After a
   mean follow-up of 7.7 +/- 9.1 years (range 1.8-30 years), 4773 of 73,321
   (6.5\%) patients developed dementia. Two studies did not report the
   rates of dementia at follow-up but reported the adjusted HR and were
   included in the pooled analysis. At pooled analysis adjusted for
   baseline confounders and covariates, AF was independently associated
   with increased risk of incident dementia (HR = 1.42 {[}95\% CI
   1.17-1.72], P < .001).
   CONCLUSION AF is independently associated with increased risk of
   dementia. Patients with AF should be periodically screened for dementia,
   which should be included among the outcomes assessed in AF treatment
   trials.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Recent studies suggest that cardiac resynchronization therapy
   (CRT) with a quadripolar left ventricular (LV) lead results in low rates
   of dislocation and phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) acutely and at
   short-term follow-up. Confirmation of these results by long-term
   observational studies is needed.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term procedural and clinical outcomes of
   CRT patients implanted with a quadripolar LV lead.
   METHODS A total of 154 consecutive heart failure patients (79\% men, age
   68 +/- 10 years) having CRT implantation attempts with a quadripolar LV
   lead were included in this observational registry. Demographic and
   clinical data were preoperatively collected, and patients were followed
   up for at least 6 months.
   RESULTS The overall implant success rate after coronary sinus
   cannulation was 97.4\%. Mean overall duration and fluoroscopy time of
   successful procedures was 112 +/- 22 and 16 +/- 8 minutes, respectively,
   while 17 +/- 13 minutes were necessary for the LV lead placement. After
   implant, the conventional bipolar configuration was used as the final
   pacing configuration in 33.3\% of the patients. Four lead dislodgments
   (requiring reoperation) and 9 clinical PNS were reported during
   follow-up; reprogramming of the device was sufficient to prevent PNS in
   all patients. Once placed, the LV lead remained stable with excellent
   pacing thresholds during follow-up (15 +/- 5 months). Overall, there
   were 71.3\% CRT responders as assessed by 6-month echocardiography, and
   66\% improved at least 1 New York Heart Association class.
   CONCLUSION Over the longer term, CRT with the quadripolar LV lead is
   associated with excellent pacing thresholds, low rates of dislocations,
   and PNS.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a strategy to minimize the error in lifetime projections
   using a positive bias temperature instability (PBTI) test has been
   proposed. Two distinctly different projection slopes were observed in a
   plot of time to failure versus oxide electric field. A small slope in
   the high-field region, which means weaker electric field dependence, led
   to an underestimation of lifetime. This result was attributed to a
   filled trap cluster at a specific trap energy level, locally reducing
   the oxide electric field. Thus, different lifetimes can be projected
   depending on stress bias. Maintaining a PBTI stress bias range below
   this trap energy level is recommended for accurate projections.}},

Abstract = {{Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention are some of the main issues
   with alloy anodes in lithium-ion batteries, and the use of electrolyte
   additives is a viable approach to overcome these problems. Accordingly,
   the effects of three electrolyte additives, viz., vinylene carbonate
   (VC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), and vinylethylene carbonate (VEC),
   on the performance of a promising alloy anode material Cu2Sb-Al2O3-C
   have been investigated. With an aim to rapidly assess the effects of the
   electrolyte additives, symmetric cells fabricated with Cu2Sb-Al2O3-C
   were used. Symmetric cell testing showed results similar to those of
   conventional half-cell testing in as little as one-fifth of the time,
   illustrating that symmetric cell testing is a valuable tool for
   optimization the performance of battery materials. Among the various
   additives and concentrations investigated, 2\% VEC was found to offer
   the best cell performance with the Cu2Sb-Al2O3-C nanocomposite anode.

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives With the increasing use of fluorescence in
   medical applications, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of
   temperature on tissue autofluorescence is essential. The purpose of this
   study is to explore the effect of temperature on the fluorescence of
   porcine cornea and rat skin and determine the relative contributions of
   irreversible changes in optical properties and in fluorescence yield.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods Fluorescence, diffuse reflectance,
   and temperature measurements were acquired from excised porcine cornea
   and rat skin over a temperature range of 080 degrees C. A dual
   excitation system was used with a 337?nm pulsed nitrogen laser for the
   fluorescence and a white light source for the diffuse reflectance
   measurements. A thermal camera measured tissue temperature. Optical
   property changes were inferred from diffuse reflectance measurements.
   The reversibility of the change in fluorescence was examined by
   acquiring measurements while the tissue sample cooled from the highest
   induced temperature to room temperature. Results The fluorescence
   intensity decreased with increasing tissue temperature. This
   fluorescence change was reversible when the tissue was heated to a
   temperature of 45 degrees C, but irreversible when heated to a
   temperature of 80 degrees C. Conclusion Auto-fluorescence intensity
   dependence on temperature appears to be a combination of
   temperature-induced optical property changes and reduced fluorescence
   quantum yield due to changes in collagen structure. Temperature-induced
   changes in measured fluorescence must be taken into consideration in
   applications where fluorescence is used to diagnose disease or guide
   therapy. Lasers Surg. Med. 44: 712718, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Assessment of the vasculature is critical for overall
   success in cranial vascular neurological surgery procedures. Although
   several methods of monitoring cortical perfusion intraoperatively are
   available, not all are appropriate or convenient in a surgical
   environment. Recently, 2 optical methods of care have emerged that are
   able to obtain high spatial resolution images with easily implemented
   instrumentation: indocyanine green (ICG) angiography and laser speckle
   contrast imaging (LSCI).
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of ICG and LSCI in measuring
   vessel perfusion.
   METHODS: An experimental setup was developed that simultaneously
   collects measurements of ICG fluorescence and LSCI in a rodent model. A
   785-nm laser diode was used for both excitation of the ICG dye and the
   LSCI illumination. A photothrombotic clot model was used to occlude
   specific vessels within the field of view to enable comparison of the 2
   methods for monitoring vessel perfusion.
   RESULTS: The induced blood flow change demonstrated that ICG is an
   excellent method for visualizing the volume and type of vessel at a
   single point in time; however, it is not always an accurate
   representation of blood flow. In contrast, LSCI provides a continuous
   and accurate measurement of blood flow changes without the need of an
   external contrast agent.
   CONCLUSION: These 2 methods should be used together to obtain a complete
   understanding of tissue perfusion.}},

Abstract = {{Many researchers have used nitrogen (N) as a dopant and/or N-containing
   functional groups to enhance the capacitance of carbon electrodes of
   electrical double layer (EDL) capacitors. However, the physical
   mechanism(s) giving rise to the interfacial capacitance of the
   N-containing carbon electrodes is not well understood. Here, we show
   that the area-normalized capacitance of lightly N-doped activated
   graphene with similar porous structure increased from 6 mu F cm(-2) to
   22 mu F cm(-2) with 0 at\%, and 2.3 at\% N-doping, respectively. The
   quantum capacitance of pristine single layer graphene and various
   N-doped graphene was measured and a trend of upwards shifts of the Dirac
   Point with increasing N concentration was observed. The increase in bulk
   capacitance with increasing N concentration, and the increase of the
   quantum capacitance in the N-doped monolayer graphene versus pristine
   monolayer graphene suggests that the increase in the EDL type of
   capacitance of many, if not all, N-doped carbon electrodes studied to
   date, is primarily due to the modification of the electronic structure
   of the graphene by the N dopant. It was further found that the quantum
   capacitance is closely related to the N dopant concentration and
   N-doping provides an effective way to increase the density of the states
   of monolayer graphene.}},

Abstract = {{In order to safely store CO2 in depleted reservoirs and deep saline
   aquifers, a better understanding of the storage mechanisms of CO2 is
   needed. Reaction of CO2 with minerals to form precipitate in the
   subsurface helps to securely store CO2 over geologic time periods, but a
   concern is the formation of localized channels through which CO2 could
   travel at large, localized rates. Pore-scale network modeling is an
   attractive option for modeling and understanding this inherently
   pore-level process, but the relatively small domains of pore-scale
   network models may prevent accurate upscaling. Here, we develop a
   transient, single-phase, reactive pore-network model that includes
   reduction of throat conductivity as a result of precipitation. The
   novelty of this study is the implementation of a new mortar/transport
   method for coupling pore networks together at model interfaces that
   ensure continuity of pressures, species concentrations, and fluxes. The
   coupling allows for modeling at larger scales which may lead to more
   accurate upscaling approaches. Here, we couple pore-scale models with
   large variation in permeability and porosity which result in initial
   preferential pathways for flow. Our simulation results suggest that the
   preferential pathways close due to precipitation, but are not redirected
   at late times.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic range of well-controlled constitutive and tunable promoters
   are essential for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology
   applications in all host organisms. Here, we apply a synthetic hybrid
   promoter approach for the creation of strong promoter libraries in the
   model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic hybrid promoters are
   composed of two modular componentsthe enhancer element, consisting of
   tandem repeats or combinations of upstream activation sequences (UAS),
   and the core promoter element. We demonstrate the utility of this
   approach with three main case studies. First, we establish a dynamic
   range of constitutive promoters and in doing so expand transcriptional
   capacity of the strongest constitutive yeast promoter, PGPD, by 2.5-fold
   in terms of mRNA levels. Second, we demonstrate the capacity to impart
   synthetic regulation through a hybrid promoter approach by adding
   galactose activation and removing glucose repression. Third, we
   establish a collection of galactose-inducible hybrid promoters that span
   a nearly 50-fold dynamic range of galactose-induced expression levels
   and increase the transcriptional capacity of the Gal1 promoter by 15\%.
   These results demonstrate that promoters in S. cerevisiae, and
   potentially all yeast, are enhancer limited and a synthetic hybrid
   promoter approach can expand, enhance, and control promoter activity.

Abstract = {{This paper determines mechanisms to mitigate errors when implementing
   Boolean functions in nano-circuits. Nano-fabrics are expected to have
   high defect rates as atomic variations directly impact such materials.
   This paper develops a coding mechanism that uses a combination of cheap,
   but unreliable nano-device as the main function and reliable, but
   expensive CMOS devices to implement the coding mechanism. The unique
   feature of this paper is that it exploits the don't-cares that naturally
   occur in Boolean functions to construct better codes. The reliable
   Boolean function problem is cast as a constraint satisfaction problem
   and then solved using a tree-based dynamic programming algorithm. (Here,
   the word ``dynamic programming{''} is used in the same sense as
   computer-science literature, i.e., and as an efficient search algorithm
   over trees.)}},

Abstract = {{Passive removal materials (PRMs) are building materials or furnishings
   that effectively control indoor pollution without substantial formation
   of chemical byproducts and without an energy penalty. Recent studies
   have suggested that clay might be an effective PRM for ozone. To assess
   clay wall plaster as a PRM for improving air quality by controlling
   ozone, perceived air quality (PAQ) was determined in the presence of
   eight combinations of an emitting and reactive pollutant source (new
   carpet), clay plaster applied to gypsum wallboard, and chamber air with
   and without ozone. A panel of 24 human subjects assessed air quality in
   twin 30 m(3) chambers using a continuous acceptability scale. Air
   samples were collected immediately prior to panel assessment to quantify
   concentrations of C-5-C-10 saturated n-aldehydes and two aromatic
   aldehydes that are commonly produced by reaction of ozone with carpet.
   Perceived air quality was most acceptable and concentrations of
   aldehydes were lowest when only clay plaster or both clay plaster and
   carpet were present in the chambers without ozone. The least acceptable
   PAQ and the highest concentrations of aldehydes were observed when
   carpet and ozone were present together; addition of clay plaster for
   this condition improved PAQ and considerably decreased aldehyde
   concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Designing for wind driven cross ventilation is challenging due to the
   dynamic characteristics of wind. While numerous studies have used wind
   tunnels and computational fluid dynamics to study cross ventilation, few
   have utilized a full scale experimental approach. Thus, this paper
   provides measurements of wind properties, facade pressures, airflow
   rates through small window openings, and tracer gas concentrations for a
   multi-zone test building located in Austin, TX. This experimental data
   connects outdoor and indoor environments and demonstrates the dynamic
   nature of wind driven cross ventilation flow. Several interesting
   observations were made: (1) cross ventilation rate can be correlated to
   the velocity component of the approaching wind that is normal to the
   inlet openings: (2) obstructions that are far upwind of a building
   (e.g., kilometers) can have significant impacts on cross ventilation
   flows: (3) wind pressures on building facades are highly dynamic that a
   steady state assumption may not be appropriate: and (4) locations of
   openings that are leeward have a small impact on the overall flow rate,
   but significantly impact a building's internal flow distribution. This
   paper provides the summary of the collected data, while the detailed
   dataset is available upon request. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper we undertake a rigorous derivation of the interface
   conditions between a poroelastic medium (the pay zone) and an elastic
   body (the non-pay zone). We assume that the poroelastic medium contains
   a pore structure of the characteristic size e and that the
   fluid/structure interaction regime corresponds to diphasic Biot's law.
   The question is challenging because the Biot's equations for the
   poroelastic part contain one unknown more than the Navier equations for
   the non-pay zone. The solid part of the pay zone (the matrix) is elastic
   and the pores contain a viscous fluid. The fluid is assumed viscous and
   slightly compressible. We study the case when the contrast of property
   is of order epsilon(2), i.e. the normal stress of the elastic matrix is
   of the same order as the fluid pressure. We assume a periodic matrix and
   obtain the a priori estimates. Then we let the characteristic size of
   the inhomogeneities tend to zero and pass to the limit in the sense of
   the two-scale convergence. The obtained effective equations represent a
   two-scale system for three displacements and two pressures, coupled
   through the interface conditions with the Navier equations for the
   elastic displacement in the non-pay zone. We prove that the appropriate
   interface conditions at the interface between an elastic and a
   poroelastic medium are: (i) the effective displacement continuity, (ii)
   the effective normal stress continuity and (iii) the normal Darcy
   velocity zero from the poroelastic side. In addition}},

Abstract = {{The deformation behavior of nanoparticles continues to be an exciting

   has been suggested that dislocations cannot exist or/do not play a role

   critical tool for addressing this issue because it allows for the
   deformation to be monitored in real time. In this article, we discuss
   some of the experimental needs and challenges for performing in situ
   nanoindentation TEM experiments on nanoparticles. In addition, we show
   both diffraction contrast and phase contrast in situ TEM nanoindentation
   experiments on silver nanoparticles with diameters below 50 nm. Evidence

Abstract = {{In this paper, a switching strategy for multiple-input converters (MICs)
   is presented and analyzed. MICs have been identified to provide a
   cost-effective approach for energy harvesting in hybrid systems, and for
   power distribution in micro-and nanogrids. The basic principle of the
   proposed switching strategy is that the effective duty ratio of each
   switch is an integer multiple of a common duty ratio (CDR), the CDR
   being the duty ratio of a common switching function that is generated at
   a higher frequency by frequency division. The proposed strategy enables
   switching functions for MICs that have a greater number of input legs to
   be generated with relative ease. Another benefit of this scheme is that
   it allows an MIC's output voltage to be regulated by employing the CDR
   as the only control variable, irrespective of the number of input legs
   present. Essentially, the strategy transforms an MIC into an equivalent
   single-input single-output system for analysis, which simplifies
   controller design and implementation. Without loss of generality, this
   technique is demonstrated by analyzing a multiple-input buck-boost
   converter. A PI controller is shown to regulate the MIC's operating
   point. The analysis is verified by simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Internal friction, which reflects the ``roughness{''} of the energy
   landscape, plays an important role for proteins by modulating the
   dynamics of their folding and other conformational changes. However, the
   experimental quantification of internal friction and its contribution to
   folding dynamics has remained challenging. Here we use the combination
   of single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer, nanosecond
   fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and microfluidic mixing to
   determine the reconfiguration times of unfolded proteins and investigate
   the mechanisms of internal friction contributing to their dynamics.
   Using concepts from polymer dynamics, we determine internal friction
   with three complementary, largely independent, and consistent approaches
   as an additive contribution to the reconfiguration time of the unfolded
   state. We find that the magnitude of internal friction correlates with
   the compactness of the unfolded protein: its contribution dominates the
   reconfiguration time of approximately 100 ns of the compact unfolded
   state of a small cold shock protein under native conditions, but
   decreases for more expanded chains, and approaches zero both at high
   denaturant concentrations and in intrinsically disordered proteins that
   are expanded due to intramolecular charge repulsion. Our results suggest
   that internal friction in the unfolded state will be particularly
   relevant for the kinetics of proteins that fold in the microsecond range
   or faster. The low internal friction in expanded intrinsically
   disordered proteins may have implications for the dynamics of their
   interactions with cellular binding partners.}},

Abstract = {{The electroforming voltage (V-et) of silicon oxide resistive random
   access memories (RRAM) treated with post-deposition-anneal (PDA) and/or
   post-metal-anneal (PMA) in different gas ambients is compared. Secondary
   ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) result shows significant incorporation of
   H/D atoms in SiOx after anneals in H-2/N-2 and D-2/N-2. V-ef is
   significantly reduced after anneal in H-2/N-2 or D-2/N-2, but D-2/N-2
   anneal results in even lower V-ef, which could be due to more stable Si
   passivation in the Si-D/O+ pair as compared to the Si-H/O+ pair. On and
   off state currents are measured at 200 mV gate bias every 60s for a
   total time of 6000 s with results showing good data retention for both
   on and off states. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{The structure and property prediction of metal oxides can significantly
   be improved by incorporating exact Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange into
   density functional theory (DFT), which is the so-called hybrid DFT. We
   explored the impact of HF exchange inclusion on the predicted
   structural, bonding, and electronic properties of bismuth vanadate
   (BiVO4), with particular attention to the difference between its
   monoclinic and tetragonal scheelite phases. The applied
   exchange-correlation (xc) functionals include the gradient corrected
   Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and the PBE-HF hybrid functionals with HF
   exchange amounts of 10\%, 25\%, and 50\%. We find that the PBE-HF25\%
   yields a monoclinic structure in very close agreement with the
   experimentally determined structure, while the PBE-HF50\% tends to
   overestimate the monoclinic distortion and the PBE/PBE-HF10\% can hardly
   identify a distinct monoclinic configuration at ambient conditions.
   Electronic structure analysis reveals that the increasing monoclinic
   distortion with the amount of HF exchange is related to the enhancement
   of hybridization between Bi 6s-O 2p antibonding states and unoccupied Bi
   6p states. The bonding mechanisms and band structures of the monoclinic
   and tetragonal phases of BiVO4 were also investigated, and we discuss
   how the predictions are sensitive to the xc functional choice.}},

   Ovalbumin 323-339}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{T cell activation requires formation of a tri-molecular interaction
   between a major histocompatibility complex (MHC), peptide, and T cell
   receptor. In a common model system, the ovalbumin epitope 323-339 binds
   the murine class II MHC, I-A(d), in at least three distinct registers.
   The DO11.10 T cell recognizes the least stable of these, as determined
   by peptide-MHC dissociation rates. Using exogenous peptides and peptide
   insertions into a carrier protein in combination with IL-2 secretion
   assays, we show that the alternate registers do not competitively
   inhibit display of the active register four. In contrast, this weakly
   binding register is stabilized by the presence of N-terminal flanking
   residues active in MHC binding. The DO11.10 hybridoma is sensitive to
   the presence of specific wild-type residues extending to at least the
   P-3 peptide position. Transfer of the P-4 to P-2 flanking residues to a
   hen egg lysozyme epitope also presented by I-A(d) increases the activity
   of that epitope substantially. These results illustrate the inherent
   complexity in delineating the interaction of multiple registers based on
   traditional thermodynamic measurements and demonstrate the potential of
   flanking residue modification for increasing the activity of weakly
   bound epitopes. The latter technique represents an alternative to
   substitution of anchor residues within a weakly bound register, which we
   show can significantly decrease the activity of the epitope to a
   responding T cell.}},

Abstract = {{Au nanoparticles and films are deposited onto clean graphene surfaces to
   study the doping effect of different Au configurations. Micro-Raman
   spectra show that both the doping type and level of graphene can be
   tuned by fine control of the Au deposition. The morphological structures
   of Au on graphene are imaged by transmission electron microscopy, which
   indicate a size-dependent electrical characteristic: isolated Au
   nanoparticles produce n-type doping of graphene, while continuous Au
   films produce p-type doping. Accordingly, graphene field-effect
   transistors are fabricated, with the in situ measurements suggesting the
   tunable conductivity type and level by contacting with different Au
   configurations. For interpreting the experimental observations, the
   first-principles approach is used to simulate the interaction within
   grapheneAu systems. The results suggest that, different doping
   properties of Augraphene systems are induced by the chemical
   interactions between graphene and the different Au configurations
   (isolated nanoparticle and continuous film).}},

Abstract = {{Hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) regulates orthogonal MAP
   kinase signaling cascades by dephosphorylating both extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. HePTP recognizes a docking site
   (D-recruitment site, DRS) on its targets using a conserved N-terminal
   sequence motif (D-motif). Using solution nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry, we compare, for the
   first time, the docking interactions of HePTP with ERK2 and p38 alpha.
   Our results demonstrate that ERK2-HePTP interactions primarily involve
   the D-motif, while a contiguous region called the kinase specificity
   motif also plays a key role in p38 alpha-HePTP interactions. D-Motif-DRS
   interactions for the two kinases, while similar overall, do show some
   specific differences.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline WO3 films were grown by reactive magnetron
   sputter-deposition in a wide range of oxygen gas flow rates while
   keeping the deposition temperature fixed at 400 degrees C. The physical
   characteristics of WO3 films were evaluated using grazing incidence
   X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), X-ray reflectivity (XRR), and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Physical characterization
   indicates that the thickness, grain size, and density of WO3 films are
   sensitive to the oxygen gas flow rate during deposition. XRD data
   indicate the formation of tetragonal WO3 films. The grain size increases
   from 21 to 25 nm with increasing oxygen gas flow rate to 65\%, at which
   point the grain size exhibits a decreasing trend to attain the lowest
   value of 15 nm at 100\% oxygen. TEM analysis provides a model consisting
   of isotropic WO3 film (nanocrystalline)-SiO2 interface (amorphous)-Si(1
   0 0) substrate. XRR simulations, which are based on this model, provide
   excellent agreement to the experimental data indicating that the
   normalized thickness of WO3 films decreases with the increasing oxygen
   gas flow rate. The density of WO3 films increases with increasing oxygen
   gas flow rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Analytical methods for the mechanics of graphene bubbles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{When placing a graphene membrane on a substrate, gas molecules may be
   trapped underneath to form bubbles. The size of a graphene bubble (e.g.,
   diameter and height) depends on the number of gas molecules that are
   trapped, the elastic properties of graphene, and the interfacial
   adhesion between graphene and the substrate. A mechanics analysis of
   such graphene bubbles is conducted via membrane and nonlinear plate
   theories, so that the interfacial adhesion can be determined directly
   from measurements of the bubble size. A comparison of the results from
   these two models establishes that the membrane analysis is sufficient
   for relatively large bubbles. The adhesion energy of mechanically
   exfoliated graphene on silicon oxide is extracted from two reported data
   sets using the simple membrane theory, and the values range from 0.097
   to 0.43 J/m(2). Moreover, the strain distribution of the graphene
   bubbles and transport of gas molecules among the bubbles are discussed.

Abstract = {{The passive stiffness at the MCP joint is a result of the elasticity of
   muscle-tendon units (MTUs) and capsule ligament complex (CLC), however,
   the relative contributions of these two components are unknown. We
   hypothesize that the MTUs provide the majority of the contributions to
   the joint stiffness by generating resistive forces when the MCP joint is
   flexed or extended. We used the work done by passive moments as a
   measure for the determination of the contributions to the joint
   stiffness. We conducted experiments with ten human subjects and
   collected joint angle and finger tip force data. The total passive
   moment and joint angle data were fitted with a double exponential model,
   and the passive moments due to the MTUs were determined by developing
   subject-specific models of the passive force-length change
   relationships. Our results show that for all the subjects, the work done
   by the passive moments from the MTUs is less than 50\% of the total work
   done, and the CLC provides dominant contributions to the joint stiffness
   throughout the flexion-extension range of the joint angle. Therefore,
   the hypothesis that the MTUs provide the majority of the contributions
   to the MCP joint stiffness is not supported. We also determined that the
   majority of the MTUs passive moment was generated by the extrinsic MTUs
   and the contributions of the intrinsic MTUs was negligible. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Vanadium oxide (V2O5) is a multifaceted material possessing desirable
   redox properties, including accessibility to multiple valence states,
   which make it attractive as a cathode for lithium ion batteries and
   microbatteries. Studies show that performance of this electrode material
   is dependent on the electrolyte employed and that solid electrolyte
   interphase (SEI) layer formation is responsible for the fade in capacity
   with multiple cycling. Nanostructured V2O5 thin films synthesized
   through reactive ballistic deposition (RBD) were studied with
   electrochemical methods, ex situ Raman and ex situ XPS in two widely
   used electrolytes: LiClO4/propylene carbonate (PC) and LiPF6/diethyl
   carbonate (DEC) + ethylene carbonate (EC). Films cycled in LiPF6/DEC+EC
   experienced a 32\% greater capacity fade between the first and second
   lithiathion/delithiation cycles than those cycled in LiClO4/PC, due to a
   redox-induced change in the surface morphology and composition and an
   irreversible transformation into an amorphous state as monitored by ex
   situ Raman. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), it was shown
   that V2O5 cycled in LiPF6/DEC+EC contained a high atomic concentration
   percentage of fluoride (16.18\%) in comparison with V2O5 electrodes
   cycled in LiClO4/PC (3.94\%). No significant amounts of carbonates,
   oxalates, or oxyfluorophosphates typically associated with SEI formation
   were found when V2O5 was cycled in either electrolyte. The results
   obtained suggest instead that HF, formed upon water contamination of the
   electrolyte, reacts with V2O5 through a self-catalyzed process both at
   open circuit and under applied potential. The formation of vanadium
   oxyfluorides causes active mass loss and severe capacity fade upon
   discharging/charging.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying naturally occurring strains in soft materials, such as those
   of the human body, requires strain gauges with equal or greater
   mechanical compliance. This manuscript reports materials and mechanics
   approaches are reported for an all-elastomer strain measurement device
   with gauge factor as high as 29 and with Young's modulus that approaches
   that of the human epidermis. These systems use thin carbon-black-doped
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (CB-PDMS) for the strain gauges due to its high
   resistivity and strong dependence on strain, and thick
   carbon-nanotube-doped PDMS (CNT-PDMS) for the interconnects due to its
   comparatively low resistivity and weak dependence on strain. Devices
   composed of molded, straight resistors of CB-PDMS joined by
   serpentine-shaped interconnects of CNT-PDMS, both in a matrix substrate
   of PDMS, have electrical responses that depend almost entirely on the
   strain in the CB-PDMS. Integrated structures of this type have Young's
   moduli of 244 kPa, which lies within the range of values for the human
   epidermis. Such sheets can be readily laminated on and form conformal
   contact to the human skin, with only modest mechanical constraints on
   natural motions. Strains measured in this mode on the wrist are between
   11.2\% and 22.6\%.}},

Title = {{Multi-scale dynamics and rheology of mantle flow with plates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Fundamental issues in our understanding of plate and mantle dynamics
   remain unresolved, including the rheology and state of stress of plates
   and slabs; the coupling between plates, slabs and mantle; and the flow
   around slabs. To address these questions, models of global mantle flow
   with plates are computed using adaptive finite elements, and compared to
   a variety of observational constraints. The dynamically consistent
   instantaneous models include a composite rheology with yielding, and
   incorporate details of the thermal buoyancy field. Around plate
   boundaries, the local resolution is 1 km, which allows us to study
   highly detailed features in a globally consistent framework. Models that
   best fit plateness criteria and plate motion data have strong slabs with
   high stresses. We find a strong dependence of global plate motions,
   trench rollback, net rotation, plateness, and strain rate on the stress
   exponent in the nonlinear viscosity; the yield stress is found to be
   important only if it is smaller than the ambient convective stress. Due
   to strong coupling between plates, slabs, and the surrounding mantle,
   the presence of lower mantle anomalies affect plate motions. The flow in
   and around slabs, microplate motion, and trench rollback are intimately
   linked to the amount of yielding in the subducting slab hinge, slab
   morphology, and the presence of high viscosity structures in the lower
   mantle beneath the slab.}},

Abstract = {{The high-voltage doped spinel oxides LiMn1.5Ni0.5-xMxO4 (M = Cr, Fe, and
   Ga; 0 <= x <= 0.08) synthesized at 900 degrees C have been investigated
   systematically before and after postannealing at 700 degrees C. Neutron
   diffraction studies reveal that the cation-ordered domain size tends to
   increase upon annealing at 700 degrees C. Time-of-flight secondary-ion
   mass spectroscopy data reveal that the dopant cations M = Cr, Fe, and Ga
   segregate preferentially to the surface, resulting in a more stable
   cathode-electrolyte interface and superior cyclability at both room
   temperature and 55 degrees C with conventional electrolytes. The doping
   with Cr and Fe stabilizes the structure with a significant disordering
   of the cations in the 16d sites even after postannealing at 700 degrees
   C, resulting in high rate capability due to low charge-transfer
   resistance and polarization loss. In contrast, the Ga-doped and undoped
   LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 samples experience an increase in cation ordering upon
   postannealing at 700 degrees C, resulting in degradation in the rate
   capability due to an increase in the charge-transfer resistance and
   polarization loss.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the anomalous I-V behavior in SiN prepared by plasma enhanced
   chemical vapor deposition for use as a gate insulator in AlGaN/GaN metal
   insulator semiconductor heterostructure filed effect transistors
   (HFETs). We observe leakage current across the dielectric with opposite
   polarity with respect to the applied electric field once the voltage
   sweep reaches a level below a determined threshold. This is observed as
   the absolute minimum of the leakage current does not occur at minimum
   voltage level (0 V) but occurs earlier in the sweep interval.
   Curve-fitting analysis suggests that the charge-transport mechanism in
   this region is Poole-Frenkel current, followed by Schottky emission due
   to band bending. Despite the current anomaly, the sample devices have
   shown a notable reduction of leakage current of over 2 to 6 order of
   magnitudes compared to the standard Schottky HFET. We show that higher
   pressures and higher silane concentrations produce better films
   manifesting less trapping. This conforms to our results that we reported
   in earlier publications. We found that higher chamber pressure achieves
   higher sheet carrier concentration that was found to be strongly
   dependent on the trapped space charge at the SiN/GaN interface. This
   would suggest that a lower chamber pressure induces more trap states
   into the SiN/GaN interface. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Gold has been shown to exhibit promising catalytic activity, and
   understanding the fundamental interactions of reactants and hydrogen
   atoms on a gold surface is key to gaining insight into hydrogenation
   reaction mechanisms. In this paper, we report that the adsorption of
   methanol onto a H-precovered Au(111) surface induces an adsorbate
   structure, or set of structures, on the surface involving both methanol
   and hydrogen adatoms with a wide range of stability on the surface.
   Coadsorption of H/MeOD or D/MeOH indicates H/D exchange between the two
   surface species, providing evidence that the H-precovered gold surface
   can dissociate the methanol O-H bond at low temperature (<120 K). These
   isotopic experiments also demonstrate that hydrogen/deuterium atoms
   released from a methanol molecule desorb at higher temperatures than
   hydrogen/deuterium atoms originating from the surface, providing insight
   into the adsorbate structure(s) present. Additionally, the presence of
   MeOH on the surface is shown to inhibit the ability of adsorbed MeOD to
   undergo hydrogen exchange, providing additional clues regarding the
   exchange reaction mechanism. These phenomena are also shown to exist for
   ethanol on H-precovered Au(111), suggesting that this behavior may be
   common to alcohols or species with an O-H functional group in general.
   These observations give insight into the behavior of the O-H group on a
   gold surface, which can aid in determining reaction mechanisms and
   directing future catalytic research.}},

Abstract = {{A fuel gas network (FGN) in a petrochemical complex can save energy
   costs substantially and reduce flaring by utilizing purge/waste fuel
   streams (Hasan et al. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2011, 50, 7414-7427). A
   properly designed FGN can involve complex and nonintuitive mixing
   scenarios and equipment arrangements. Furthermore, the purge/waste gases
   and their characteristics can vary significantly with changing operation
   modes in a plant, which makes routing them into an FGN a challenge. This
   article reports a multiperiod two-stage stochastic programming model to
   design and operate an FGN that caters to all operating modes, and shows
   the usefulness of optimized FGN on a refinery case study. Results show
   that the proposed model produces a resilient FGN and reduces capital
   costs versus the single-mode model of (Hasan et al. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.

Abstract = {{A new approach for flare monitoring is proposed so that flare combustion
   efficiency can be predicted online in industrial plants. Multivariate
   image analysis (MIA), which is based on principal component analysis
   (PCA) and projection to latent structures (PLS), has been applied to
   flare combustion systems in order to predict their resulting combustion
   efficiencies, as a function of the crosswind velocity, using simulated
   results, and as a function of steam or air flow rates, using
   experimental tests of a full-size flare. The results show that a
   multivariate regression model based on flare color images can be used to
   predict the flare performance over a range of operating conditions for
   steam-assisted flares. Therefore, simple two-dimensional color images of
   industrial flares may be a fast, accurate, and inexpensive approach for
   online monitoring of these industrial combustion systems. This would
   allow for developing effective flare control and mitigation strategies.}},

Title = {{Can switching fuels save water? A life cycle quantification of
   freshwater consumption for Texas coal- and natural gas-fired electricity}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thermal electricity generation is a major consumer of freshwater for
   cooling, fuel extraction and air emissions controls, but the life cycle
   water impacts of different fossil fuel cycles are not well understood.
   Much of the existing literature relies on decades-old estimates for
   water intensity, particularly regarding water consumed for fuel
   extraction. This work uses contemporary data from specific resource
   basins and power plants in Texas to evaluate water intensity at three
   major stages of coal and natural gas fuel cycles: fuel extraction, power
   plant cooling and power plant emissions controls. In particular, the
   water intensity of fuel extraction is quantified for Texas lignite,
   conventional natural gas and 11 unconventional natural gas basins in
   Texas, including major second-order impacts associated with multi-stage
   hydraulic fracturing. Despite the rise of this water-intensive natural
   gas extraction method, natural gas extraction appears to consume less
   freshwater than coal per unit of energy extracted in Texas because of
   the high water intensity of Texas lignite extraction. This work uses new
   resource basin and power plant level water intensity data to estimate
   the potential effects of coal to natural gas fuel switching in Texas'
   power sector, a shift under consideration due to potential environmental
   benefits and very low natural gas prices. Replacing Texas' coal-fired
   power plants with natural gas combined cycle plants (NGCCs) would reduce
   annual freshwater consumption in the state by an estimated 53 billion
   gallons per year, or 60\% of Texas coal power's water footprint, largely
   due to the higher efficiency of NGCCs.}},

Abstract = {{A shear failure model for nonductile RC columns that sustain flexural
   yielding prior to shear failure is proposed. The model, which relates
   shear failure to column end rotation, was derived by performing a
   forward stepwise linear regression on a database compiled from column
   tests. Critical parameters that affect rotation capacity at shear
   failure were found to be axial load, spacing (rather than amount) of
   transverse reinforcements, and nominal shear stress. The model is
   suitable for use in nonlinear frame analyses using either a
   lumped-plasticity or fiber-section column idealization. The model also
   can be used to determine rotation limits for performance-based
   assessment of existing buildings. DOI:

Abstract = {{Computer algorithms used to identify recurrent freeway bottlenecks have
   been studied since the deployment of loop detecting systems. Such
   algorithms automatically analyze the archived loop detector data and
   identify potential recurrent bottlenecks and their characteristics, such
   as location, time of day, and activation rate, for further
   investigation. In a highway congestion mitigation project, such
   algorithms can save time and resources for the initial screening of
   bottlenecks over a large freeway network. These algorithms include
   rule-based, contour-map-based, and simulation-based methods. However,
   existing methods require loop detector data with high accuracy and
   consistency, which is difficult to achieve in prevailing loop detecting
   systems. This paper proposes a new bottleneck identification algorithm
   with strong error and noise tolerance. Several simple denoising methods
   to improve the error resistance of existing algorithms are also
   proposed. Using statistical error analysis methods, the proposed
   algorithm and the denoising methods were calibrated and evaluated using
   field data collected from two distinct freeway corridors (US 12/14 and
   I-894) in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Ground truth data for this study
   come from the manual inspection of 287,055 traffic video snapshots in
   the course of a month. In the evaluation tests, the proposed algorithm
   can produce quality congestion identification results with fewer false
   alarms than the existing algorithms, especially when identifying severe
   bottleneck congestion. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000424. (C) 2012

   factors (Q) of doubly clamped single wall carbon nanotube resonators are

   discussed and the discrepancies associated with the methods are

   T-beta, 0 < beta < 1). It is shown that the Q estimated from the
   temporal response is in good agreement with the Q estimated from
   frequency response. This work also demonstrates that the proposed method
   is particularly advantageous when multiple modes are simultaneously

Abstract = {{Flame-based synthesis is an attractive industrial process for the
   large-scale generation of nanoparticles. In this aerosol process, a
   gasified precursor is injected into a high-temperature turbulent flame,
   where oxidation followed by particle nucleation and other solid phase
   dynamics create nanoparticles. Precursor oxidation, which ultimately
   leads to nucleation, is strongly influenced by the turbulent flame
   dynamics. Here, direct numerical simulation of a canonical homogeneous
   flow is used to understand the interaction between a methane/air flame
   and titanium tetrachloride oxidation to titania. Detailed chemical
   kinetics is used to describe the combustion and precursor oxidation
   processes. Results show that the initial precursor decomposition is
   heavily influenced by the gas phase temperature field. However,
   temperature insensitivity of subsequent reactions in the precursor
   oxidation pathway slow down conversion to the titania. Consequently,
   titania formation occurs at much longer time scales compared to that of
   hydrocarbon oxidation. Further, only a fraction of the precursor is
   converted to titania, and a significant amount of partially-oxidized
   precursor species are formed. Introducing the precursor in the oxidizer
   stream as opposed to the fuel stream has only a minimal impact on the
   oxidation dynamics. In order to understand modeling issues, the DNS
   results are compared with the laminar flamelet model. It is shown that
   the flamelet assumption qualitatively reproduces the oxidation
   structure. Further, reduced oxygen concentration in the near-flame
   location critically affects titania formation. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The promises of modern biotechnology hinge upon the hope that we can
   understand microscopic cellular complexity and in doing so create novel
   function. In this regard, the fields of systems and synthetic biology
   are important for accelerating both our understanding of biological
   systems and our ability to quantitatively engineer cells. At the nexus
   of these two fields is a unique synergy that can help attain these
   goals. Thus, the next greatest advances in biology and biotechnology are
   arising at the intersection of the top-down systems approach and the
   bottom-up synthetic approach. Collectively, these developments enable
   the precise control of cellular state for systems studies and the
   discovery of novel parts, control strategies, and interactions for the
   design of robust synthetic function. This review seeks to highlight this
   activity as well as provide a perspective for future directions.
   Combining these efforts can provide novel insights into cellular

   algorithm. The developed algorithm can be implemented in a distributed
   way, vertically among communication layers and horizontally among all
   entities in the network, clearly showing what should be done at each

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) technique to test the
   setup and hold times of memory interface circuitry. The BIST scheme
   generates data and clock using an on-chip pattern generator. The
   relative timing difference between data and clock is controlled using a
   cycle-by-cycle control method for testing. Two test methods of static
   and dynamic modes have been presented to measure the timing difference
   and then are used to specify the setup and hold times. The static mode
   is mainly used to detect pass or fail for timing specifications, and the
   dynamic mode is devised to measure the amount of timing mismatches and
   thus detect timing margin degradations due to the timing delay
   mismatches. Using these two test modes, the BIST scheme obtains test
   results with low frequency signals, which are compatible with low
   performance testers. The test chip including the BIST scheme has been
   fabricated with a commercial 0.18-mu m CMOS process. The chip
   measurement results are shown to validate the testability of the BIST
   scheme for the setup and hold times of memory devices.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor testing is aimed at screening fabrication defects that
   impact expected functionality. While catastrophic defects result in non
   working devices, parametric faults result in marginalities and are of
   increasing concern with deep sub-micron process technologies. This work
   presents a scheme to monitor Circuit-Under-Test (CUT) static bias
   current to identify catastrophic as well as parametric faults. All
   circuits require a deterministic amount of DC bias current which may
   vary outside the specifications when faults exist within the circuit. We
   propose a compensated current measurement Built-in-Current-Sensor (BICS)
   scheme, which can be used for sub-system level/circuit-level bias
   current measurements. The BICS provides accessibility to internal blocks
   and enables isolated parametric testing. Calibration routine enables
   process independence and provides robustness. The BICS is compatible
   with Very-Low-Cost Automatic Test Equipment (VLC-ATE), and can be used
   for detailed parametric testing in the production environment.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a tractable framework for SINR analysis in
   downlink heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) with flexible cell
   association policies. The HCN is modeled as a multi-tier cellular
   network where each tier's base stations (BSs) are randomly located and
   have a particular transmit power, path loss exponent, spatial density,
   and bias towards admitting mobile users. For example, as compared to
   macrocells, picocells would usually have lower transmit power, higher
   path loss exponent (lower antennas), higher spatial density (many
   picocells per macrocell), and a positive bias so that macrocell users
   are actively encouraged to use the more lightly loaded picocells. In the
   present paper we implicitly assume all base stations have full queues;
   future work should relax this. For this model, we derive the outage
   probability of a typical user in the whole network or a certain tier,
   which is equivalently the downlink SINR cumulative distribution
   function. The results are accurate for all SINRs, and their expressions
   admit quite simple closed-forms in some plausible special cases. We also
   derive the average ergodic rate of the typical user, and the minimum
   average user throughput - the smallest value among the average user
   throughputs supported by one cell in each tier. We observe that neither
   the number of BSs or tiers changes the outage probability or average
   ergodic rate in an interference-limited full-loaded HCN with unbiased
   cell association (no biasing), and observe how biasing alters the
   various metrics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose jointly optimized linear transceiver
   algorithms called interference aware-coordinated beamforming (IA-CBF)
   for a two-cell system where each base station is equipped with multiple
   transmit antennas. To generalize IA-CBF to more than two-cell scenarios,
   a new beam-switching mechanism combined with IA-CBF is proposed. For a
   two-cell system, we derive a minimum-mean-square-error-type IA-CBF
   algorithm based on a lower bound on the achievable sum rate. We propose
   optimal (under an assumption of zero other-cell interference) and
   suboptimal transmit/receive beamforming vectors through zero-forcing
   IA-CBF algorithms. We also investigate the optimality of the proposed
   IA-CBF algorithms with respect to the number of receive antennas.
   Numerical results confirm that the proposed system with two
   transmit/receive antennas achieves the full degrees of freedom (a.k.a.
   multiplexing gain) of the two-cell multiple-input multiple-output
   channel while showing a better sum rate performance than competitive
   solutions such as noncooperative eigen-beamforming and interference
   nulling. A three-dimensional ray tracing tool is also used to evaluate
   the proposed multi-cell IA-CBF algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging research has largely focused on the identification of
   associations between brain activation and specific mental functions.
   Here we show that data mining techniques applied to a large database of
   neuroimaging results can be used to identify the conceptual structure of
   mental functions and their mapping to brain systems. This analysis
   confirms many current ideas regarding the neural organization of
   cognition, but also provides some new insights into the roles of
   particular brain systems in mental function. We further show that the
   same methods can be used to identify the relations between mental
   disorders. Finally, we show that these two approaches can be combined to
   empirically identify novel relations between mental disorders and mental
   functions via their common involvement of particular brain networks.
   This approach has the potential to discover novel endophenotypes for
   neuropsychiatric disorders and to better characterize the structure of
   these disorders and the relations between them.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of designing scheduling algorithms for
   multichannel (e.g., OFDM-based) wireless downlink networks, with a large
   number of users and proportionally large bandwidth. For this system,
   while the classical MaxWeight algorithm is known to be
   throughput-optimal, its buffer-overflow performance is very poor
   (formally, it is shown that it has zero rate function in our setting).
   To address this, a class of algorithms called iterated Heaviest matching
   with Longest Queues First (iHLQF) is proposed. The algorithms in this
   class are shown to be throughput-optimal for a general class of
   arrival/channel processes, and also rate-function-optimal (i.e.,
   exponentially small buffer overflow probability) for certain
   arrival/channel processes. iHLQF, however, has higher complexity than
   MaxWeight (n(4) versus n(2), respectively). To overcome this issue, a
   new algorithm called Server-Side Greedy (SSG) is proposed. It is shown
   that SSG is throughput-optimal, results in a much better per-user buffer
   overflow performance than the MaxWeight algorithm (positive rate
   function for certain arrival/channel processes), and has a computational
   complexity (n(2)) that is comparable to the MaxWeight algorithm. Thus,
   it provides a nice tradeoff between buffer-overflow performance and
   computational complexity. These results are validated by both analysis
   and simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The photoselective vaporization of prostate (PVP) green light (532 nm)
   laser is increasingly being used as an alternative to the transurethral
   resection of prostate (TURP) for treatment of benign prostatic
   hyperplasia (BPH) in older patients and those who are poor surgical
   candidates. In order to achieve the goals of increased tissue removal
   volume (i.e., ``ablation{''} in the engineering sense) and reduced
   collateral thermal damage during the PVP green light treatment, a two
   dimensional computational model for laser tissue ablation based on
   available parameters in the literature has been developed and compared
   to experiments. The model is based on the control volume finite
   difference and the enthalpy method with a mechanistically defined energy
   necessary to ablate (i.e., physically remove) a volume of tissue (i.e.,
   energy of ablation E-ab). The model was able to capture the general
   trends experimentally observed in terms of ablation and coagulation
   areas, their ratio (therapeutic index (TI)), and the ablation rate (AR)
   (mm(3)/s). The model and experiment were in good agreement at a smaller
   working distance (WD) (distance from the tissue in mm) and a larger
   scanning speed (SS) (laser scan speed in mm/s). However, the model and
   experiment deviated somewhat with a larger WD and a smaller SS; this is
   most likely due to optical shielding and heat diffusion in the laser
   scanning direction, which are neglected in the model. This model is a
   useful first step in the mechanistic prediction of PVP based BPH laser
   tissue ablation. Future modeling efforts should focus on optical
   shielding, heat diffusion in the laser scanning direction (i.e.,
   including 3D effects), convective heat losses at the tissue boundary,
   and the dynamic optical, thermal, and coagulation properties of BPH
   tissue. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007452]}},

   transitions introduce cooperative electron-lattice interactions has (a)
   accounted for numerous phase transitions in solids, (b) led to
   formulation of the rules for the sign, ferromagnetic vs.
   antiferromagnetic, of interatomic spin-spin interactions, and (c)
   provides a rationale for single-ion magnetostriction and
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy in transition-metal compounds. Moreover,
   the further recognition that short-range cooperative orbital ordering
   extends to temperatures well above the long-range orbital ordering
   temperature or critical concentration of orbitally degenerate cations
   has (a) led to the introduction of chemical inhomogeneties into a single
   crystallographic phase to achieve a technical objective and (b)
   consideration of their role in determining the sign of spin-spin
   interactions in a paramagnetic phase containing orbital fluctuations.
   (2) Exploration of the transition from localized to itinerant
   3d-electron behavior in transition-metal oxides showed it to be
   first-order, which has allowed interpretation of (a) charge-density
   waves in single-valent systems and (b) dynamic phase segregations in
   mixed-valent systems to be manifestations of a different type of
   long-range vs. short-range cooperative electron-lattice coupling. (3)
   The study of Li-insertion chemistry has led (a) to Li-ion rechargeable
   batteries, (b) an appreciation of the influence of counter cations in
   solids on d-electron redox energies, and (c) the concept of Fermi energy
   pinning and its consequences as the energy of a d-electron couple in a
   transition-metal compound descends across the top of the anion-p bands.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface coatings are widely used to render
   stealth properties to nanoparticles in biological applications. There is
   abundant literature on the benefits A PEG coatings and their ability to
   reduce protein adsorption, to diminish nonspecific interactions with
   cells, and to improve pharmacokinetics, but very little discussion of
   the limitations of PEG coatings. Here, we show that physiological
   concentrations of cysteine and cystine can displace methoxy-PEG-thiol
   molecules from the gold nanoparticle (GNP) surface that leads to protein
   adsorption and cell uptake in macrophages within 24 h. Furthermore, we
   address this problem by incorporating an alkyl linker between the PEG
   and the thiol moieties that provides a hydrophobic shield layer between
   the gold surface and the hydrophilic outer PEG lam. The mPEG-alkyl-thiol
   coating greatly reduces protein adsorption on GNPs and their macrophage
   uptake. This has important implications for the design of GNP for
   biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{A surprising ``upright{''} fibrilar conformation (with a height of
   similar to 2.6 nm) was observed with in situ atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) for an amyloid-like peptide (NH2-VGGAVVAV-COHN2) on mica surface,
   which is very different from its ``flat{''} conformation (with a much
   smaller height of similar to 0.9 nm) on the HOPG surface. Our all-atom
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that it is the strong
   electrostatic interactions between the N-terminus of the peptide and the
   mica surface that result in an upright conformation and a highly ordered
   beta-stranded structure on mica, with a height of 2.5 +/- 0.1 nm,
   consistent with the AFM experiment. Similarly, our MD simulations show
   that the same peptides adopt a flat conformation on HOPG surfaces due to
   the favorable hydrophobic interactions with HOPG. Our simulations also
   indicate that epitaxial patterns found in mica are preferentially
   controlled by anisotropic binding sites commer surate with the inherent
   crystallographic unit cell of the basal substrate.}},

Abstract = {{We present a generative approach for simultaneously registering a
   probabilistic atlas of a healthy population to brain magnetic resonance
   (MR) scans showing glioma and segmenting the scans into tumor as well as
   healthy tissue labels. The proposed method is based on the expectation
   maximization (EM) algorithm that incorporates a glioma growth model for
   atlas seeding, a process which modifies the original atlas into one with
   tumor and edema adapted to best match a given set of patient's images.
   The modified atlas is registered into the patient space and utilized for
   estimating the posterior probabilities of various tissue labels. EM
   iteratively refines the estimates of the posterior probabilities of
   tissue labels, the deformation field and the tumor growth model
   parameters. Hence, in addition to segmentation, the proposed method
   results in atlas registration and a low-dimensional description of the
   patient scans through estimation of tumor model parameters. We validate
   the method by automatically segmenting 10 MR scans and comparing the
   results to those produced by clinical experts and two state-of-the-art
   methods. The resulting segmentations of tumor and edema outperform the
   results of the reference methods, and achieve a similar accuracy from a
   second human rater. We additionally apply the method to 122 patients
   scans and report the estimated tumor model parameters and their
   relations with segmentation and registration results. Based on the
   results from this patient population, we construct a statistical atlas
   of the glioma by inverting the estimated deformation fields to warp the
   tumor segmentations of patients scans into a common space.}},

Abstract = {{We report a highly sensitive method based on phase-stabilized swept
   source optical coherence elastography (PhS-SSOCE) to measure elastic
   wave propagation in soft tissues in vivo. The waves were introduced

   of the swept source optical coherence tomography signal. The technique
   was utilized to measure age-related changes in elastic flexural wave
   velocity and attenuation in mice cornea in vivo. Results demonstrate
   that the wave velocity increases with animal age, supporting previous
   observations that stiffness of mice cornea gradually increases with age.
   Our studies suggest that the PhS-SSOCE technique could potentially be
   used to obtain biomechanical properties of ocular tissues in vivo. (c)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{At select wavelengths, near infrared (IR) light is absorbed in the
   preretinal media of the eye. This produces small transient increases in
   temperature that temporarily alter the local index of refraction. If the
   IR exposure is sufficiently high, a momentary reduction in the focusing
   power of the eye can be induced through an effect known as thermal
   lensing. Fundamental optical interaction and safety aspects of this
   phenomenon have been demonstrated previously in animal and artificial
   eye models. However, whether the effect will induce an observable visual
   change in human subjects has not been explored. Here, results of a pilot
   study are shown where eight human subjects were exposed to an IR laser
   at levels that were below the safe exposure limit. The exposures did
   induce a transient visual distortion if sufficiently high levels were
   used. While the description of the visual change varied between
   subjects, this experiment was able to determine a general guideline for
   power needed to induce significant effects in human subjects. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Combined intravascular ultrasound and intravascular photoacoustic
   (IVUS/IVPA) imaging has been previously established as a viable means
   for assessing atherosclerotic plaque morphological and compositional
   characteristics using both endogenous and exogenous contrast. In this
   study, IVUS/IVPA imaging of atherosclerotic rabbit aortas following
   systemic injection of gold nanorods (AUNRs) with peak absorbance within
   the tissue optical window is performed. Ex vivo imaging results reveal a
   high photoacoustic signal from localized AUNRs in regions with
   atherosclerotic plaques. Corresponding histological staining further
   confirms the preferential extravasation of AUNRs in atherosclerotic
   regions with compromised luminal endothelium and acute inflammation. The
   ability to detect AUNRs using combined IVUS and photoacoustic imaging in
   the presence of luminal saline and luminal blood is evaluated using both
   spectroscopic and single wavelength IVPA imaging techniques. Results
   demonstrate that AUNR detection within the arterial wall can be achieved
   using both methods, even in the case of imaging through luminal blood.

Abstract = {{Results from a typical post-stack or pre-stack seismic inversion are
   band-limited primarily due to missing low and high frequencies in the
   wavelet. Thin beds that are of primary interest in reservoir
   characterization are generally poorly resolved. Inversion methods are
   designed to incorporate a priori information in several different ways.
   In this paper, we examine and compare performances of two such methods:
   a stochastic method that draws a starting broad-band model based on some
   statistics, derived from well logs, and a deterministic method that
   incorporates constraints using a model norm, based on the basis pursuit
   decomposition. We apply a stochastic method employing very fast
   simulated annealing for optimization, using fractal-based starting
   models, and a basis pursuit inversion (deterministic method) to a single
   post-stack dataset to assess the performance of the two algorithms. We
   find that both methods are able to derive a broad-band acoustic
   impedance from the band-limited post-stack seismic data. The results
   show a similar structure and therefore result in possible increasing
   confidence in the interpretation. The essence of our study is that the
   calibration of results from two different methods can provide an
   interpreter with more information in interpreting broad-band inversion
   results hitherto not derived from standard deterministic algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Aurora B kinase is essential in the process of mitosis, and its
   overexpression has been reported to be associated with a number of solid
   tumors. We therefore carried out molecular docking, molecular dynamics,
   and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (MM-PBSA)
   calculations on several structurally diverse inhibitors (pentacyclic,
   pyrimidine, quinazoline, and pyrrolopyridine derivatives) and Aurora B
   kinase to explore the structural and chemical features responsible for
   the binding recognition mechanism. Molecular simulations reveal that the
   binding site mainly consists of six binding regions (sites A-F). We have
   identified that sites B and C are required for optimum binding in Aurora
   B-inhibitor complexes, sites A and F are needed to improve
   pharmacokinetic properties, while sites D and E lead to enhanced
   stability. We verified that hydrogen bonding to the hinge region and
   hydrophobic contact with the conserved hydrophobic pocket are of
   critical importance in the systems studied. Specifically, the amino
   acids Glu171, Phe172, and Ala173 in the hinge region and Leu99, Val107,
   and Leu223 in the conserved hydrophobic pocket probably account for the
   high binding affinities of these systems, as shown by hydrogen-bonding
   analysis and energy decomposition analysis. Hydrophobic contact with
   Phe172 is also in agreement with experimental data. In addition, the
   MM-PBSA calculations reveal that the binding of these inhibitors to
   Aurora B kinase is mainly driven by van der Waals/nonpolar interactions.
   The findings of this study should help to elucidate the binding pattern
   of Aurora B inhibitors and aid in the design of novel active ligands.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
   infection is investigated through an optimal structured treatment
   interruption (STI) schedule of two classes of antiretroviral drugs,
   mainly, reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. An STI
   treatment strategy may be beneficial in lowering the risk of HIV
   mutating to drug-resistant strains, and could provide patients with
   respite from toxic side effects of HAART. A shorter treatment period is
   considered compared to previous studies and the solution to the HIV STI
   problem is obtained via the Finite Set Control Transcription (FSCT)
   formulation. The FSCT formulation offers a unique approach for handling
   multiple independent decision variables simultaneously, and, as is shown
   by the results of this study, is well-suited for an effective treatment
   of the optimal STI problem. The results obtained in the present
   investigation demonstrate that immune boosting and subsequent natural
   suppression of the viral load are possible even when a reduced STI

Abstract = {{We present grayscale laser image formation from a programmable binary
   mask using a digital micromirror device (DMD) followed by a telescope
   with an adjustable pinhole low-pass filter. System performance was
   measured by comparing the intensity conformity with respect to the
   target image and by the energy conversion efficiency. A theoretical
   analysis of image precision proved high-precision image formation and
   inspired the iterative pattern refinement process based on the point
   spread function of a single DMD pixel to seek optimized image quality.
   We derived the diffraction efficiency formula of the DMD and discussed
   the overall system energy efficiency with operation wavelengths. Actual
   image precision performance was evaluated by measuring the
   root-mean-square (RMS) error of a series of sinusoidal-flattop profiles
   with different system bandwidths. We produced grayscale laser images
   with different spatial spectral content using intensity profiles of
   Laguerre-Gaussian, Hermite-Gaussian, and Lena-flattop beams. Measured
   RMS errors of all examples of various bandwidths were consistent with
   the image precision of the sinusoidal reference patterns. The ripple
   effect caused by the sharp-edged pinhole was the major contributor to
   the residual error in the output images. Error histograms had a
   zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation equal to the
   value of the RMS error. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{An abstraction of the physical-layer coding using bit pipes that are
   coupled through data-rates is insufficient to capture notions such as
   node cooperation in cooperative relay networks. Consequently,
   network-stability analyses based on such abstractions are valid for
   non-cooperative schemes alone and meaningless for cooperative schemes.
   Motivated from this, this paper develops a framework that brings the
   information-theoretic coding scheme together with network-stability
   analysis. This framework does not constrain the system to any particular
   achievable scheme, i.e., the relays can use any cooperative coding
   strategy of its choice such as amplify/compress/quantize or any
   alter-and-forward scheme. The paper focuses on the scenario when
   coherence duration is of the same order of the packet/codeword duration,
   the channel distribution is unknown and the fading state is only known
   causally. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold: first, it
   develops a low-complexity queue-architecture to enable stable operation
   of cooperative relay networks, and, second, it establishes the
   throughput optimality of a simple network algorithm that utilizes this
   queue-architecture.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents improved architectures for a fused floating-point
   add-subtract unit. The fused floating-point add-subtract unit is useful
   for digital signal processing (DSP) applications such as fast Fourier
   transform (FFT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) butterfly
   operations. To improve the performance of the fused floating-point
   add-subtract unit, a dual-path algorithm and pipelining are employed.
   The proposed designs are implemented for both single and double
   precision and synthesized with a 45-nm standard-cell library. The fused
   floating-point add-subtract unit saves 40\% of the area and power
   consumption compared to a discrete floating-point add-subtract unit. The
   proposed dual-path design reduces the latency by 30\% compared to the
   discrete design with area and power consumption between that of the
   discrete and fused designs. Based on a data flow analysis, the proposed
   fused dual-path floating-point add-subtract unit can be split into two
   pipeline stages. Since the latencies of two pipeline stages are fairly
   well balanced, the throughput is increased by 80\% compared to the
   nonpipelined dual-path design.}},

Abstract = {{The solubilities of H-2, N-2, O-2, CH4, and CO2 were determined over a
   range of pressures at 35 degrees C in a glassy, amorphous,
   ortho-functional polyimide prepared from
   3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-biphenyl (HAB) and
   2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA). The
   HAB-6FDA polyimide was partially converted to its corresponding
   thermally rearranged (TR) polymer by thermal treatments at different
   times and temperatures. At 10 atm, solubility coefficients of H-2, N-2,
   O-2, CH4, and CO2 increased by a factor of approximately two between the
   polyimide and the most highly converted TR polymer. Correlations between
   solubility and penetrant condensability were in good agreement with such
   correlations in other fluorinated polymers. Dual-mode sorption model
   parameters were determined from the sorption isotherms. The affinity
   constant, Henry's law solubility, and Langmuir capacity constant
   increased with gas condensability, and increases in the Langmuir
   capacity constant were observed as TR polymer conversion increased.
   Comparisons were made between the solubility selectivity of CO2/CH4,
   O-2/N-2, CH4/N-2, and CO2/N-2 with HAB-6FDA, its corresponding TR
   polymers, and with other polymers in the literature. Qualitatively, a
   decrease in solubility selectivity for gas pairs including CO2
   correlates with imide and acetate loss during conversion. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Phage display has enabled the rapid isolation of antigen-specific
   antibodies from combinatorial libraries of V-H and V-L genes obtained
   from lymphocytes of immunized animals. Recently, a different approach to
   antibody isolation that circumvents library screening and instead relies
   on the mining of the V-H and V-L gene repertoires obtained by high
   throughput sequencing of cDNAs from bone marrow antibody-secreting cells
   was reported. Here we compared the antibodies obtained via phage library
   screening or via repertoire mining of V gene cDNAs obtained from total
   splenocytes of mice immunized with the hapten trinitrophenyl (TNP)
   conjugated to carrier proteins. We show that, despite the large
   heterogeneity of B lymphocytes in the spleen, the most abundant V genes
   encoded antigen-specific antibodies, indicating that total splenocytes
   can be used in place of bone marrow plasma cells for antibody discovery
   at least in high titer animals. While both phage display and repertoire
   mining yielded antigen-specific antibodies showing comparable affinities
   by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis, clones obtained by the
   latter approach displayed higher selectivity towards TNP relative to
   control haptens. Interestingly, the antibody genes isolated by phage
   display were of low abundance or absent from the V gene repertoire
   obtained by 454 sequencing. Similarly, the highly abundant V genes
   identified by repertoire mining, that as soluble antibodies were
   antigen-specific, were found to be poorly displayed on phage and were
   not enriched by phage panning. Thus, our results reveal that phage
   display and repertoire mining of immune repertoires are complementary
   technologies that can yield different antigen-specific antibody clones.}},

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Over the last decade a surge in fragment barrier research has led to
   investigation of numerous materials and material augmentations in the
   attempt to improve the ballistic performance of systems designed to
   protect personnel, vehicles or infrastructure from impact and blast
   loads. One widely studied material augmentation approach is the use of
   coatings, often polymers, to enhance the performance of protection
   systems constructed from metal, concrete, composite and fabric
   materials. In recent research the authors have conducted the first
   experimental study of the ballistic performance of fabrics coated with a
   magnetically responsive polymer. Zero field impact experiments on coated
   fabric targets showed a 61\% increase in impact energy dissipation,
   although the coated targets were not competitive with neat fabrics on a
   protection per unit mass basis. Under an applied field of 110 kA m(-1),
   the ballistic performance of the coated fabric was reduced. The
   reduction in performance may be attributed to a reduction in material
   damping and an increase in material modulus for the magnetostrictive
   component of the coating. Analysis of the coated fabric response to
   magnetic preloads suggests that coating tensile stresses and
   coating-fabric interface stresses induced by the applied field may also
   adversely affect ballistic performance.}},

   Change Models}},
Journal = {{GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{321-349}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This article formulates an empirical discrete land use model within a
   spatially explicit economic structural framework for land use change
   decisions. The underlying framework goes beyond mechanistically fitting
   models for the spatial process of land use change to more closely link
   landowner decision behavior to land use patterns. At the same time, the
   article explicitly considers spatial spillover effects in the decisions
   of landowners of proximately located parcels. These spillover or peer
   influences may be due to strategic or collaborative partnerships between
   landowners, and can be associated with variables observable to the
   analyst (such as accessibility to city centers and market places) and
   variables unobservable to the analyst (such as perhaps soil quality and
   neighborhood attitudes/politics). In addition to spatial spillover
   effects, heterogeneity is also likely to exist in the decision-making
   process of different landowners because of differential responsiveness
   to various signals relevant to decision making. This leads to
   correlation in land uses across time that is stationary for the same
   spatial unit. The article accommodates these technical considerations by
   formulating a random coefficients spatial lag discrete choice model
   using a fine resolution for the spatial unit of analysis. Time-varying
   random effects are also considered to capture the effects of
   time-varying unobserved factors (for instance, unobserved landowner
   attitudes regarding specific land uses may shift over time). The model
   is estimated using Bhat's maximum approximate composite marginal
   likelihood inference approach. The analysis is undertaken using the City
   of Austin parcel-level land use database for multiple years (1995, 2000,
   2003, and 2006). The estimation results indicate that proximity to
   highways and other roadways, distance from floodplains, parcel location
   in the context of existing development, and distance from schools are
   important determinants of land use. As importantly, the results provide
   very strong evidence of temporal dependency and spatial dynamics in land
   use decisions. There is also a suggestion that major highways may not
   only physically partition regions, but may also act as social barriers
   for didactic interactions among individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Traction-separation relations have been used to represent the adhesive
   interactions at bimaterial interfaces for contact and fracture analyses.
   There are a variety of methods for determining these relations, which
   are broadly sorted into iterative and direct methods. Here we compare
   the traction-separation relations for a silicon/epoxy interface
   extracted by two such methods. Interferometric measurements of the
   normal crack opening displacements near the crack front in a
   double-cantilever beam specimen were exploited along with an augmented
   analytical solution for J-integral as an illustration of the direct
   method. As an example of the iterative method, we relied on comparisons
   of measured crack length and normal crack opening displacements with
   numerical simulations obtained from two types of candidate
   traction-separation relations. It was found that the shape of the
   traction-separation relation, in addition to the interfacial toughness
   and strength, was needed to bring the numerical solutions into optimal
   registration with the measurements. On the other hand, the direct method
   lived up to its name in terms of ease of parameter extraction while
   providing a reasonable set of parameters.}},

Abstract = {{CO oxidation is studied at pressures between 4 and 100 Tort and
   temperatures from 400 K to 670 K on inverse model catalysts made of
   Fe2O3 nanoclusters grown on a Au(111) single crystal surface. The
   addition of Fe2O3 nanoclusters transformed the inert Au(111) single
   crystal into an active catalyst for CO oxidation. The catalytic activity
   increases with iron oxide coverage initially and then decreases when the
   iron oxide coverage is greater than 0.5 monolayers. Additionally, when
   the iron oxide particles form a continuous film on Au(111), there is no
   catalytic activity. These experimental results strongly suggest that the
   active sites for CO oxidation are located at the iron oxide/gold
   perimeter. Kinetic measurements suggest that CO oxidation by chemisorbed
   oxygen at the Fe2O3/Au perimeter is likely to be the rate-limiting step.
   Carbon deposition observed via a post-reaction Auger electron spectra
   suggests that multiple reaction pathways are involved in CO oxidation
   over Fe2O3/Au(111). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We prove the optimal convergence estimate for first-order interpolants
   used in finite element methods based on three major approaches for
   generalizing barycentric interpolation functions to convex planar
   polygonal domains. The Wachspress approach explicitly constructs
   rational functions, the Sibson approach uses Voronoi diagrams on the
   vertices of the polygon to define the functions, and the Harmonic
   approach defines the functions as the solution of a PDE. We show that
   given certain conditions on the geometry of the polygon, each of these
   constructions can obtain the optimal convergence estimate. In
   particular, we show that the well-known maximum interior angle condition
   required for interpolants over triangles is still required for
   Wachspress functions but not for Sibson functions.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new video quality database that models video distortions
   in heavily-trafficked wireless networks and that contains measurements
   of human subjective impressions of the quality of videos. The new LIVE
   Mobile Video Quality Assessment (VQA) database consists of 200 distorted
   videos created from 10 RAW HD reference videos, obtained using a RED ONE
   digital cinematographic camera. While the LIVE Mobile VQA database
   includes distortions that have been previously studied such as
   compression and wireless packet-loss, it also incorporates dynamically
   varying distortions that change as a function of time, such as
   frame-freezes and temporally varying compression rates. In this article,
   we describe the construction of the database and detail the human study
   that was performed on mobile phones and tablets in order to gauge the
   human perception of quality on mobile devices. The subjective study
   portion of the database includes both the differential mean opinion
   scores (DMOS) computed from the ratings that the subjects provided at
   the end of each video clip, as well as the continuous temporal scores
   that the subjects recorded as they viewed the video. The study involved
   over 50 subjects and resulted in 5,300 summary subjective scores and
   time-sampled subjective traces of quality. In the behavioral portion of
   the article we analyze human opinion using statistical techniques, and
   also study a variety of models of temporal pooling that may reflect
   strategies that the subjects used to make the final decision on video
   quality. Further, we compare the quality ratings obtained from the
   tablet and the mobile phone studies in order to study the impact of
   these different display modes on quality. We also evaluate several
   objective image and video quality assessment (IQA/VQA) algorithms with
   regards to their efficacy in predicting visual quality. A detailed
   correlation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing is carried out.
   Our general conclusion is that existing VQA algorithms are not
   well-equipped to handle distortions that vary over time. The LIVE Mobile
   VQA database, along with the subject DMOS and the continuous temporal
   scores is being made available to researchers in the field of VQA at no
   cost in order to further research in the area of video quality
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{We study throughput-optimal scheduling in mobile ad hoc networks with
   time-varying (fading) channels. Traditional back-pressure algorithms
   (based on the work by Tassiulas and Ephremides) require instantaneous
   network state (topology, queues-lengths, and fading channel-state) in
   order to make scheduling/routing decisions. However, such instantaneous
   network-wide (global) information is hard to come by in practice,
   especially when mobility induces a time-varying topology. With
   information delays and a lack of global network state, different mobile
   nodes have differing ``views{''} of the network, thus inducing
   uncertainty and inconsistency across mobile nodes in their topology
   knowledge and network state information. In such a setting, we first
   characterize the throughput-optimal rate region and develop a
   back-pressure-like scheduling algorithm, which we show is
   throughput-optimal. Then, by randomly partitioning the geographic region
   spatially into disjoint and interference-free sub-areas, and sharing
   delayed topology and network state information only among nearby mobile
   nodes, we develop a localized low-complexity scheduling algorithm. The
   algorithm uses instantaneous local information (the queue length,
   channel state and current position at a mobile node) along with delayed
   network state information from nearby nodes (i.e., from nodes that were
   within a nearby geographic region as opposed to network-wide
   information). The proposed algorithm is shown to be near-optimal, where
   the geographic distance over which delayed network-state information is
   shared determines the provable lower bound on the achievable throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Equation-based optimization using geometric programming (GP) for
   automated synthesis of analog circuits has recently gained broader
   adoption. A major outstanding challenge is the inaccuracy resulting from
   fitting the complex behavior of scaled transistors to posynomial
   functions. In this paper, we advance a novel optimization strategy that
   explicitly handles the error of the model in the course of optimization.
   The innovation is in enabling the successive refinement of transistor
   models within gradually reducing ranges of operating conditions and
   dimensions. Refining via a brute force requires exponential complexity.
   The key contribution is the development of a framework that optimizes
   efficient convex formulations, while using SPICE as a feasibility oracle
   to identify solutions that are feasible with respect to the accurate
   behavior rather than the fitted model. Due to the poor posynomial fit,
   standard GP can return grossly infeasible solutions. Our approach
   dramatically improves feasibility. We accomplish this by introducing
   robust modeling of the fitting error's sample distribution information
   explicitly within the optimization. To address cases of highly stringent
   constraints, we introduce an automated method for identifying a true
   feasible solution through minimal relaxation of design targets. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on two benchmarks: a
   two-stage CMOS operational amplifier and a voltage-controlled oscillator
   designed in TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. Our algorithm is able to
   identify superior solution points producing uniformly better power and
   area values under a gain constraint with improvements of up to 50\% in
   power and 10\% in area for the amplifier design. Moreover, whereas
   standard GP methods produced solutions with constraint violations as
   large as 45\%, our method finds feasible solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Monoclonal antibodies continue to command a large market for treatment
   of a variety of diseases. In many cases, the doses required for
   therapeutic efficacy are large, limiting options for antibody delivery
   and administration. We report a novel formulation strategy based on
   dispersions of antibody nanoclusters that allows for subcutaneous
   injection of highly concentrated antibody (similar to 190?mg/mL). A
   solution of monoclonal antibody 1B7 was rapidly frozen and lyophilized
   using a novel spiral-wound in-situ freezing technology to generate
   amorphous particles. Upon gentle stirring, a translucent dispersion of
   approximately 430?nm protein clusters with low apparent viscosity
   (similar to 24?cp) formed rapidly in buffer containing the
   pharmaceutically acceptable crowding agents such as trehalose,
   polyethylene glycol, and n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Upon in vitro dilution
   of the dispersion, the nanoclusters rapidly reverted to monomeric
   protein with full activity, as monitored by dynamic light scattering and
   antigen binding. When administered to mice as an intravenous solution,
   subcutaneous solution, or subcutaneous dispersion at similar
   (4.67.3?mg/kg) or ultra-high dosages (51.6?mg/kg), the distribution and
   elimination kinetics were within error and the protein retained full
   activity. Overall, this method of generating high-concentration,
   low-viscosity dispersions of antibody nanoclusters could lead to
   improved administration and patient compliance, providing new
   opportunities for the biotechnology industry. (C) 2012 Wiley

   reversibility of electrochemical redox reaction and the charge-transfer
   resistance of LVP/C cathode material have been significantly improved by
   Na doping. The improved performances can be attributed to the more

Abstract = {{Introduction Near-infrared (NIR) absorbing plasmonic nanoparticles
   enhance photothermal therapy of tumors. In this procedure, systemically
   delivered gold nanoparticles preferentially accumulate at the tumor site
   and when irradiated using laser light, produce localized heat sufficient
   to damage tumor cells. Gold nanoshells and nanorods have been widely
   studied for this purpose, and while both exhibit strong NIR absorption,
   their overall absorption and scattering properties differ widely due to
   their geometry. In this paper, we compared the photothermal response of
   both nanoparticle types including the heat generation and photothermal
   efficiency. Methods Tissue simulating phantoms, with varying
   concentrations of gold nanoparticles, were irradiated with a
   near-infrared diode laser while concurrently monitoring the surface
   temperature with an infrared camera. We calculated nanoshell and nanorod
   optical properties using the Mie solution and the discrete dipole
   approximation, respectively. In addition, we measured the heat
   generation of nanoshells and nanorods at the same optical density to
   determine the photothermal transduction efficiency for both nanoparticle
   types. Results We found that the gold nanoshells produced more heat than
   gold nanorods at equivalent number densities (\# of nanoparticles/ml),
   whereas the nanorods generated more heat than nanoshells at equivalent
   extinction values at the irradiance wavelength. To reach an equivalent
   heat generation, we found that it was necessary to have similar to 36x
   more nanorods than nanoshells. However, the gold nanorods were found to
   have two times the photothermal transduction efficiency than the gold
   nanoshells. Conclusion For the nanoparticles tested, the nanoshells
   generated more heat, per nanoparticle, than nanorods, primarily due to
   their overall larger geometric cross-section. Conversely, we found that
   the gold nanorods had a higher photothermal efficiency than the gold
   nanoshells. In conclusion, the ideal choice of plasmonic nanoparticle
   requires not only per particle efficiency, but also the in vivo particle
   targeting ability under study. Lasers Surg. Med. 44: 675684, 2012. (c)

Abstract = {{The use of high-frequency acoustics has recently emerged as a viable
   method for mapping the areal coverage of seagrasses. Since the bubbles
   produced by seagrass plants are partly responsible for the observed
   acoustic signature, it is likely that sound transmission throughout a
   seagrass canopy varies on circadian cycles coinciding with
   photosynthetic bubble production. This study examined the propagation of
   high-frequency (100 kHz) sound energy through the seagrass canopies of
   Syringodium filiforme, Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum in a
   shallow outdoor mesocosm. Relative changes in the received acoustic
   energy were recorded every hour during a 24-h period and compared to
   independently measured rates of oxygen production. The mean acoustic
   intensity of energy transmitted throughout the seagrass canopy varied by
   3.5 dB for S. filiforme, 4.4 dB for T. testudinum and 4.7 dB for H.
   wrightii over a 24-h period. These transmission characteristics are
   encouraging for the future development of in situ acoustic assessments
   of seagrass photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving information theoretic security with practical coding
   complexity is of definite interest. This work first focuses on the key
   agreement problem. For this problem, a new cross-layer secure coding
   protocol over block fading channels is proposed. The proposed scheme
   requires only the statistical knowledge about the eavesdropper channel
   state information (CSI), and, utilizing a privacy amplification
   technique, reduces the problem of key agreement to a provably secure
   coding problem per block. Focusing on this secure coding problem, it is
   shown that polar codes, introduced by Arikan, achieve nonzero perfect
   secrecy rates for the binary-input degraded wiretap channel while
   enjoying a remarkably low encoding-decoding complexity. We further show
   that, in the special case of symmetric main and eavesdropper channels,
   this coding technique achieves the secrecy capacity. This approach is
   also extended to the multiple-access channel with a degraded
   eavesdropper where a nontrivial achievable secrecy region is
   established. This polar coding method is then utilized in the proposed
   key agreement protocol, where the secure coding per block is used to
   create an advantage for the legitimate nodes over the eavesdropper,
   which is then turned into a private key via the privacy amplification
   module.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a new communication strategy, ergodic interference
   alignment, for the K-user interference channel with time-varying fading.
   At any particular time, each receiver will see a superposition of the
   transmitted signals plus noise. The standard approach to such a scenario
   results in each transmitter-receiver pair achieving a rate proportional
   to 1/K its interference-free ergodic capacity. However, given two
   well-chosen time indices, the channel coefficients from interfering
   users can be made to exactly cancel. By adding up these two
   observations, each receiver can obtain its desired signal without any
   interference. If the channel gains have independent, uniform phases,
   this technique allows each user to achieve at least 1/2 its
   interference-free ergodic capacity at any signal-to-noise ratio. Prior
   interference alignment techniques were only able to attain this
   performance as the signal-to-noise ratio tended to infinity. Extensions
   are given for the case where each receiver wants a message from more
   than one transmitter as well as the ``X channel{''} case (with two

Abstract = {{The recent deployment of data-rich smart phones has led to a fresh
   impetus for understanding the performance of wide area ad hoc networks.
   The most popular medium access mechanism for such ad hoc networks is
   CSMA/CA with RTS/CTS. In CSMA-like mechanisms, spatial reuse is achieved
   by implementing energy-based guard zones. We consider the problem of
   simultaneously scheduling the maximum number of links that can achieve a
   given signal to interference ratio (SIR). In this paper, using tools
   from stochastic geometry, we study and maximize the medium access
   probability of a typical link. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) We
   show that a simple modification to the RTS/CTS mechanism, viz., changing
   the receiver yield decision from an energy-level guard zone to an SIR
   guard zone, leads to performance gains; and (ii) We show that this
   combined with a simple modification to the transmit power level-setting
   it inversely proportional to the square root of the link gain-leads to
   significant improvements in network throughput. Further, this simple
   power-level choice is no worse than a factor of two away from optimal
   over the class of all ``local{''} power level selection strategies for
   fading channels, and further is optimal in the non-fading case. The
   analysis relies on an extension of the Mat,rn hard core point process
   which allows us to quantify both these SIR guard zones and this power
   control mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A ubiquitous source of uncertainty in fire modeling is specifying the

   a predictor-corrected method and the Consolidated Model of Fire and
   Smoke Transport (CFAST) zone model to calculate hot gas layer (HGL)
   temperatures in single compartment configurations. The inverse method
   runs at super-real-time speeds while calculating an inverse HRR solution
   that reasonably matches the original HRR curve. Examples of the inverse
   method are demonstrated by using a multiple step HRR case, complex HRR
   curves, experimental temperature data with a constant HRR, and a case
   with an experimentally measured HRR. In principle, the methodology can
   be applied using any reasonably accurate fire model to invert for the

Abstract = {{The implantation of matrix-embedded endothelial cells (MEECs) has been
   reported to have great therapeutic potential in controlling the vascular
   response to injury and maintaining patency in arteriovenous anastomoses.
   While there is an appreciation of their effectiveness in clinical and
   animal studies, the mechanisms through which they mediate these powerful
   effects remain relatively unknown. In this work, we examined the
   hypothesis that the 3-dimensional microarchitecture of the tissue
   engineering scaffold was a key regulator of endothelial behavior in MEEC
   constructs. Notably, we found that ECs in porous collagen scaffold had a
   markedly altered cytoskeletal structure with oriented actin fibers and
   rearrangement of the focal adhesion proteins in comparison to cells
   grown on 2D surfaces. We examined the immunomodulatory capabilities of
   MEECs and discovered that they were able to reduce the recruitment of
   monocytes to an inflamed endothelial monolayer by 5-fold compared to EC
   on 2D surfaces. An analysis of secreted factors from the cells revealed
   an 8-fold lower release of Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1) from
   MEECs. Differences between 3D and 2D cultured cells were abolished in
   the presence of inhibitors to the focal adhesion associated signaling
   molecule Src suggesting that adhesion-mediated signaling is essential in
   controlling the potent immunomodulatory effects of MEEC. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The poor electrochemical performance of LiMnPO4 nanoplates relative to

   {[}010] direction. A 10\% volume change and a cooperative Jahn-Teller
   distortion of the Mn3+ sites in the MnPO4 phase introduces a large
   strain across the interface that impedes the rate of interface motion
   and therefore the rate of Li extraction/insertion. Nevertheless, a
   capacity of 107.5 mAh g(-1) at the C/20 rate had a capacity fade of only
   0.08\% per cycle LiFePO4 platelets, on the other hand, have the {[}010]

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{276-282}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Owing to concerns about radon exposure, there is a need for
   understanding risk associated with fly ash in concrete. Monte Carlo
   simulations were applied, based on the radium specific activity of
   concrete constituents taken from the literature, to predict
   probabilities for the radium specific activity and radon exhalation
   rate. The model was then used to predict the indoor radon concentrations
   and effective annual doses from two different slab-on-grade concrete
   floors, one with and one without fly ash, in a typical single-family
   home in the United States. Due to uncertainty in the literature-reported
   values, a sensitivity analysis was conducted varying the emanation
   fraction of the fly ash concrete floors. The results show that concrete
   floors made without fly ash and a 5\% emanation fraction, resulted in
   90\% of the simulated homes having an indoor radon concentration of less
   than or equal to 2.3 Bq m(-3) and an associated annual dose of less than
   or equal to 54 mu Sv y(-1). This annual dose represents 4\% of the total
   annual background inhalation dose. A 25wt\% fly ash concrete with an
   emanation fraction of 3\% achieved the same exposure probability, but
   higher assumed emanation fractions raised the exposure probability. In
   general, the predicted radon exposure from fly ash concrete suggests
   minimal population health effects. But, given the serious health effects
   of radon exposure the influence of fly ash on the emanation fraction and
   radioactive pollution indoors deserves further exploration. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a novel recognition algorithm for the
   discrimination of epilepsy based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.
   We validate the algorithm on a benchmark dataset in order to compare the
   algorithm with other algorithms in the literature. More specifically,
   features were extracted from the bilinear time-frequency distributions
   (TFD) of the EEG signal. A one-against-one decomposition is used to
   break the multi-class problem into binary subproblems solvable with a
   support vector machine (SVM). The decomposition permitted binary
   subproblem-dependent feature libraries to be constructed from
   biologically inspired features derived from conditional moments
   calculated from EEG TFD. This results in a flexible, class-dependent
   feature selection based on a forward selection wrapper representing a
   departure from prior work which tends to utilize the same set of
   features to delineate all classes. We investigated the sensitivity of
   the classification accuracy to changes in the proportion of data used to
   train the algorithm. It was found that the distribution of
   classification accuracies was statistically similar over a range of
   proportions of data used to train the algorithm. This served to validate
   our algorithm in a statistical sense and represents a significant
   departure from literature, which tends to report only the best result
   for a given classification algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, the
   newly introduced algorithm is able to outperform the best reported
   accuracy in literature for the problem considered in this paper. (c)

Title = {{A GRASP with adaptive large neighborhood search for pickup and delivery

Abstract = {{The pickup and delivery problem (POP) has been studied extensively for
   applications ranging from courier, cargo and postal services, to public
   transportation. The work presented here was inspired by a daily route
   planning problem at a regional air carrier who was trying to determine
   the benefits of transshipment. Accordingly, a primary goal of this paper
   is identify the circumstances under which measurable cost saving can be
   achieved when one aircraft transports a request from its origin to an
   intermediate point and a second aircraft picks it up and delivers it to
   its final destination. In structuring the analysis, we describe a unique
   way to model this transshipment option on a directed graph and introduce
   a specialized two-route insertion heuristic that considers when to
   exploit this option. Based on the new representation, most existing
   heuristics for the POP can be readily extended to handle transshipments.
   To find solutions, we developed a greedy randomized adaptive search
   procedure (GRASP) with several novel features. In the construction
   phase, shipment requests are inserted into routes until all demand is
   satisfied or no feasible insertion exists. In the improvement phase, an
   adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is used to modify portions
   of the feasible routes. Specialized removal and insertion heuristics
   were designed for this purpose. In the absence of test cases in the
   literature, we also developed a procedure for randomly generating
   problem instances. Testing was done on 56 existing PDP instances which
   have 50 requests each, and on 50 new data sets with 25 requests each and
   one transshipment location. For the former, the performance and solution
   quality of the GRASP were comparable to the best known heuristics. For
   the latter, GRASP found the solutions within 1\% of optimality on 88\%
   of the instances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical calculations with real-space pseudopotentials constructed
   within density-functional theory are employed to calculate mechanical
   and electronic properties for {[}100], {[}110], and {[}111] germanium
   nanowires up to 2.7 nm in diameter. Uniaxial strain is applied to wires
   within the range of -5 to 5\%. The strain energy is used to calculate
   the Young's modulus for each wire, whose values are found to increase
   with diameter up to approximately the theoretical bulk values.
   Electronic band structures are calculated for each wire with respect to
   strain, and from these structures band gaps are obtained. The size and
   the nature (direct or indirect) of the band gaps are found to be
   influenced by the growth direction, wire size, and strain amount.
   Carrier effective masses are calculated from the band structures and may
   be discontinuous under certain amounts of strain owing to band crossing,
   which can correspond to sudden drops in carrier mobilities.}},

Abstract = {{Four LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 spinel cathodes with different degrees of
   transition-metal ion ordering have been synthesized by controlling the
   heat treatment condition. The effect of transition-metal ion ordering on
   the electrochemical and structural characteristics of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4
   during cycling between 5.0 and 2.0 V has been investigated by an
   analysis of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical data.
   Refinement of the XRD data confirms the difference between the size of
   the empty octahedral sites in the ordered and disordered spinel phases.
   Ex situ XRD analysis reveals the following: (i) the two distinct
   plateaus (at similar to 2.7 and similar to 2.1 V) involving the
   insertion of lithium ions into the 16c octahedral sites are linked to
   the evolution of two tetragonal phases (T1 and T2). The T2 phase
   originates from the additional lattice distortion due to the smaller
   size of the 16c octahedral sites in the disordered phase compared to
   that of the lithium ion; (ii) larger structural changes occur in the
   disordered samples during cycling at 5.0-2.0 V due to a larger lattice
   distortion; (iii) the T2 phase transforms slowly to the T1 phase during
   the rest period without any load; and (iv) lithium ions can reversibly
   insert into both 8a tetrahedral and 16c octahedral sites regardless of
   the transition-metal ion ordering. Comparison of the cyclability data
   with different voltage windows reveals that the volume and c/a ratio
   changes associated with the cubic to T1 and T2 phase transitions cause
   rapid capacity fade when LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 is cycled between 5.0 and 2.0 V.
   These transformations restrict its use in the entire voltage range of
   5.0-2.0 V despite its impressive theoretical capacity of similar to 294
   mAh/g.}},

Abstract = {{Since the potential for alloying lithium with silicon is outside the
   window of stability of common commercial electrolytes, silicon surfaces
   form an amorphous solid electrolyte interphase (SET) under applied
   potential, which hampers silicon's performance as a lithium-ion battery
   anode. We have investigated the composition, distribution, and ambient
   stability of the SEI formed on undoped silicon (001) wafers configured
   as model electrodes in three different electrochemical conditions using
   a reduced oxidation interface for transporting air-sensitive samples
   from a glovebox to an ultra-high-vacuum chamber for X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Variable potential cycling and step
   experiments included linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry
   (CV), and chronoamperometry (CA). CV and LSV experiments on silicon
   electrodes scanned from open-circuit voltage to lithiation (3-0.01 V vs
   Li/Li+) showed a suppression of carbonate-containing species relative to
   CA experiments (potential step for 300 s at 0.01 V vs Li/Li+) in
   anoxic)(PS measurements. When silicon electrodes were exposed to ambient
   air, SEI layers reacted through both fluorination and combustion
   processes to produce different SET product distributions than those
   prepared under anoxic conditions.}},

   examined, and it was found that 50 bp was sufficient to drive the
   assembly of microspheres efficiently, forming not only dimers but also
   chainlike structures. The effect of stoichiometry on the yield was also
   examined. The analysis demonstrated that self-assembly of 50 bp
   microspheres can be driven nearly to completion by stoichiometric excess
   in a manner similar to Le Chatelier's principle in common chemical

Title = {{Fast strontium transport induced by hydrodynamic dispersion and
   pH-dependent sorption}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{As a fluid carries solutes through a porous material, species that sorb
   onto the surface of the material travel more slowly than the fluid.
   Stronger adsorption results in slower solute migration, or increased
   solute retardation. The adsorption of strontium (Sr2+) onto iron-oxides
   is strongly pHdependent and becomes significant at high pH. Radioactive
   Sr2+ isotopes are, therefore, commonly stored in alkaline solutions to
   maximize their retardation. Field observations and numerical simulations
   of the leakage of such solutions into low-pH soils, however, show that
   even Sr2+ stored in alkaline solutions can migrate without retardation.
   Migration occurs because hydrodynamic dispersion allows mixing of Sr2+
   with the low-pH fluid forming an acidic Sr2+-rich plume which can travel
   without retardation. Here we report the first experimental observations
   confirming this dispersion-induced fast Sr2+ transport. We report
   column-flood experiments where a high-pH solution containing Sr2+ was
   injected into a low-pH porous medium of iron-oxide-coated beads. We
   observe both a strongly retarded Sr2+ front and an isolated fast pulse
   of Sr2+ traveling at the average fluid velocity. This dispersion-induced
   fast pulse of strontium must be taken into account when considering the
   safety of radionuclide storage in alkaline solutions. Citation:

Abstract = {{Surface deposition of polydopamine, PD, using facile aqueous-based
   chemistry at mild reaction conditions, was accomplished on reverse
   osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration membranes.
   This surface treatment not only retained much of the membranes'
   intrinsic pure water permeability, but also improved the fouling
   resistance of polypropylene microfiltration (MF),
   poly(tetrafluoroethylene) MF, poly(vinylidene fluoride) MF, poly(arylene
   ether sulfone) ultrafiltration (UF), polysulfone UF, polyamide (PA)
   nanofiltration, and PA reverse osmosis membranes, as measured using
   oil/water emulsion filtration. To demonstrate scalability of this
   approach, PD was applied to, and improved the fouling resistance of,
   membrane modules. Following PD deposition, membranes could be further
   modified by grafting fouling-resistant macromolecules, such as
   poly(ethylene glycol), to further improve fouling resistance of MF
   membranes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{(Y0.5In0.5)BaCo4-xZnxO7 (1.0 <= x <= 2.0) oxides crystallizing in a
   trigonal P31c structure have been explored as alternative cathode
   materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). At a given Zn content, the
   (Y0.5In0.5) BaCo4-xZnxO7 compositions exhibit superior phase stability
   compared to YBaCo4-xZnxO7 and InBaCo4-xZnxO7 at the operating
   temperatures of SOFC (600-800 degrees C). In the
   (Y0.5In0.5)Ba(Co4-xZnx)O-7 system, the x = 1 sample offers a combination
   of good electrochemical performance, low thermal expansion coefficient
   (TEC), and enhanced chemical stability against Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC)
   electrolyte while demonstrating good phase stability at 600-800 degrees
   C for 100 h. Optimum cathode performance could be obtained by employing
   (Y0.5In0.5)BaCo3ZnO7 + GDC (50:50 wt.\%) composite cathodes attached at
   850 degrees C for 3 h as evidenced by ac-impedance spectroscopy, and the
   fuel cell performance of this composite cathode was evaluated using
   anode-supported single cells. With a combination of excellent
   high-temperature phase stability, low TEC, and good electrochemical
   performances, the trigonal (Y0.5In0.5)BaCo3ZnO7 composition is an
   attractive cathode candidate for intermediate temperature SOFC. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{It is well appreciated that delivery of therapeutic agents through the
   pulmonary route could provide significant improvement in patient
   compliance and reduce systemic toxicity for a variety of diseases. Many
   inhalable drug formulations suffer from low respirable fractions, rapid
   clearance by alveolar macrophages, target non-specificity, and
   difficulty in combining aerodynamic properties with efficient cellular
   uptake. To overcome these challenges, we developed an enzyme-responsive,
   nanoparticle-in-microgel delivery system. This system is designed to
   provide optimal aerodynamic carrier size for deep lung delivery,
   improved residence time of carriers in the lungs by avoiding rapid
   clearance by macrophages, and reduction of side effects and toxicity by
   releasing encapsulated therapeutics in response to disease-specific
   stimuli. This unique carrier system is fabricated using a new Michael
   addition during (water-in-oil) emulsion (MADE) method, especially
   suitable for biologic drugs due to its gentle fabrication conditions.
   The resulting microgels have a highly porous internal structure and an
   optimal aerodynamic diameter for effective deep lung delivery. They also
   exhibit triggered release of various nanoparticles and biologics in the
   presence of physiological levels of enzyme. In addition, the
   nanoparticle-carrying microgels showed little uptake by macrophages,
   indicating potential for increased lung residence time and minimal
   clearance by alveolar macrophages. Collectively, this system introduces
   a rationally designed, disease-specific, multi-tiered delivery system
   for use as an improved pulmonary carrier for biologic drugs. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We have investigated the feasibility of multimode polysilicon waveguides
   to demonstrate the suitability of polysilicon as a candidate for
   multilayer photonic applications. Solid Phase Crystallization (SPC) with
   a maximum temperature of 1000 degrees C is used to create polysilicon on
   thermally grown SiO2. We then measure the propagation losses for various
   waveguide widths on both polysilicon and crystalline silicon platforms.
   We find that as the width increases for polysilicon waveguides, the
   propagation loss decreases similar to crystalline silicon waveguides. At
   a waveguide width of 10 mu m, polysilicon and crystalline silicon
   waveguides have propagation losses of 0.56dB/cm and 0.31 dB/cm,
   respectively, indicating there is little bulk absorption from the
   polysilicon and is the lowest propagation loss for polysilicon
   demonstrated to date. In addition, the first 1x12 polysilicon MMI is
   demonstrated with a low insertion loss of -1.29dB and a high uniformity
   of 1.07dB. These results vindicate the use of polysilicon waveguides of
   varying widths in photonic integrated circuits. (C) 2012 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Ethers are an important group of organic compounds that are primarily
   prepared via homogeneous catalysis, which can lead to operational and
   environmental issues. Here we demonstrate the production of ethers via
   heterogeneous catalysis over H adatom-covered gold at temperatures lower
   than 250 K. Symmetrical ethers can be formed via a self-coupling
   reaction of corresponding aldehydes; for example, homocoupling of
   acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde yields diethyl ether and di-n-propyl
   ether, respectively. In addition, coupling reactions between alcohols
   and aldehydes, with different carbon chain lengths, are observed via the
   production of the corresponding unsymmetrical ethers. A reaction
   mechanism is proposed, suggesting that an alcohol-like intermediate via
   partial hydrogenation of aldehydes on the surface plays a key role in
   these reactions. These surface chemical reactions suggest possible
   heterogeneous routes to low-temperature production of ethers.}},

Abstract = {{Packet classification is one of the most challenging functions in
   Internet routers since it involves a multi-dimensional search that
   should be performed at wire-speed. Hierarchical packet classification is
   an effective solution which reduces the search space significantly
   whenever a field search is completed. However, the hierarchical approach
   using binary tries has two intrinsic problems: back-tracking and empty
   internal nodes. To avoid back-tracking, the hierarchical set-pruning
   trie applies rule copy, and the grid-of-tries uses pre-computed switch
   pointers. However, none of the known hierarchical algorithms
   simultaneously avoids empty internal nodes and back-tracking. This paper
   describes various packet classification algorithms and proposes a new
   efficient packet classification algorithm using the hierarchical
   approach. In the proposed algorithm, a hierarchical binary search tree,
   which does not involve empty internal nodes, is constructed for the
   pruned set of rules. Hence, both backtracking and empty internal nodes
   are avoided in the proposed algorithm. Two refinement techniques are
   also proposed: one for reducing the rule copy caused by the set-pruning
   and the other for avoiding rule copy. Simulation results show that the

Abstract = {{The molecular dynamics of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were studied by
   dielectric spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis in the 20-300
   degrees C range. The well-established plasticizing effect of water on
   the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of PVA was revisited. Improper
   water elimination analysis has led to a misinterpretation of thermal
   relaxations in PVA such that a depressed Tg for wet PVA films (ca. 40
   degrees C) has been assigned as a secondary beta relaxation in a number
   of previous studies in the literature. In wet PVA samples, two different
   VogelFulcherTammann behaviors separated by the moisture evaporation
   region (from 80 to 120 degrees C) are observed in the low- (from 20 to
   80 degrees C) and high- (>120 degrees C) temperature ranges. Previously,
   these two regions were erroneously assigned to two Arrhenius-type
   relaxations. However, once the moisture was properly eliminated, a
   single non-Arrhenius a relaxation was clearly observed. X-ray
   diffraction analysis revealed that the crystalline volume fraction was
   almost constant up to 80 degrees C. However, the crystallinity increased
   approximately 11\% when temperature increased to 180 degrees C. A
   secondary beta c relaxation was observed at 140 degrees C and was
   related to a change in the crystalline volume fraction, as previously
   reported. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2012}},

Title = {{A Stochastic Tree-Search Algorithm for Generative Grammars}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new search method that has been developed
   specifically for search trees defined by a generative grammar.
   Generative grammars are useful in design as a way to encapsulate the
   design decisions that lead to candidate solutions. Since the candidate
   solutions are not confined to a single configuration or topology and
   thus useful in conceptual design, they may be difficult to
   computationally analyze. Analysis is achieved in this method by querying
   the user. A formal definition of a rule-based interactive tree-search is
   presented in this paper. The user interaction is kept to 30 pair-wise
   comparisons of candidates. From the data gathered from the comparisons,
   a stochastic decision-making process infers what candidate solutions
   best match the known optimal. The method is implemented and applied to a
   grammar for tying neckties. It is shown through 21 user experiments and
   4000 automated experiments that the method consistently finds solutions
   within the 99.8 percentile. The computational complexity of the proposed
   algorithm is also studied. The implications of this method for
   conceptual design are expounded on in the conclusions. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{A global point mascon model for the geopotential is proposed that is
   memory light to execute, simple to implement (at any derivative level),
   and is naturally amenable to parallelism. In contrast, conventional
   high-fidelity geopotential calculation using spherical harmonics is
   expensive, cumbersome to implement, and relies on recursive nonparallel
   relations. To solve for the global point mascon model, the gravity
   inversion problem is posed classically as a large and dense
   least-squares estimation problem. The well-known ill-conditioned nature
   of the inversion is overcome in part using orthogonal solution methods,
   a judicious choice for the mascon distribution, and numerically
   preferred summation techniques. A variety of resolutions are examined
   including global point mascon models with up to 30,720 mascons.
   Measurements are simulated using truncated spherical harmonics
   evaluations from the GGM02C gravity field derived from the GRACE
   spacecraft. Resolutions are chosen to target residual levels at least an
   order of magnitude smaller than the published expected errors of the
   GGM02C. A single central processing unit Fortran implementation is found
   to be approximately equal in speed when compared with spherical
   harmonics for all resolutions, whereas a parallel implementation on an
   inexpensive graphics processing unit leads to an order of magnitude
   speedup in the case of a 156 x 156 gravity field. In addition, the
   global point mascon model is found to be particularly attractive for
   MATLAB users due to MATLAB's efficient use of large matrix operations.}},

Abstract = {{In path planning and guidance applications, linear targeting through
   differential corrections is a classical approach for identifying
   feasible solutions that meet specified mission and trajectory
   constraints. However, to date, these methods relied on the assumption
   that the associated correction maneuvers were impulsive in nature. This
   impulsive assumption is generally reasonable when the duration of the
   engine burn is small. However, this approximation breaks down when lower
   thrust engines are employed as the duration of the burn becomes more
   significant. In these cases, an impulsive linear targeting algorithm is
   inadequate. Often times, low-thrust problems of this type are solved
   from the perspective of optimal trajectory design and depend on
   numerical methods like nonlinear programming. These methods, however,
   are generally considered prohibitive for autonomous flight applications,
   where computational resources are limited and optimality is not always
   as important as feasibility. The present study focuses on the
   theoretical development and numerical validation of a linear targeting
   algorithm capable of accommodating finite burn maneuvers. Examples are
   presented to contrast the performance of this new targeting process
   against more classical impulsive targeting methods. The examples
   presented focus largely on precision entry applications, but the finite
   burn targeting process itself is applicable across a broad set of
   scenarios and fields.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of students' construction and technology background is an
   important input to the process of designing technology-enhanced
   instruction. Current literature in student background is either not
   specific for the construction/civil engineering student population or
   lacks direct implications for pedagogical design. This paper presents a
   survey study that assesses students' self-reported technology skills and
   attitude, learning preferences, and baseline construction knowledge. The
   survey is designed as a questionnaire with three sections: demographic
   and background information, technology attitude and exposure, and
   construction-related knowledge. From the 280 data points collected, it
   was found that today's students are exposed to a wide range of
   technology applications. They had a positive attitude toward technology,
   were enthusiastic video-game players, and strongly preferred learning
   activities that involved interactions, whether these interactions were
   face-to-face or mediated by technology. These findings suggest that
   technology-assisted learning would excite and engage students. The paper
   also provides a discussion on specific pedagogical design implications
   of the findings and ways in which these could be incorporated in the
   design of technology-enhanced learning tools. DOI:

Abstract = {{The JNK-JIPI interaction represents an attractive target for the
   selective inhibition of JNK-mediated signaling. We report a virtual
   screening (VS) workflow, based on a combination of three-dimensional
   shape and electrostatic similarity, to discover novel scaffolds for the
   development of non-ATP competitive inhibitors of JNK targeting the
   JNK-JIP interaction. Of 352 (0.13\%) compounds selected from the NCI
   Diversity Set, more than 22\% registered as hits in a biochemical kinase
   assay. Several compounds discovered to inhibit JNK activity under
   standard kinase assay conditions also impeded JNK activity in HEK293
   cells. These studies led to the discovery that the lignan (-)-zuonin A
   inhibits JNK-protein interactions with a selectivity of 100-fold over
   ERK2 and p38 MAPK alpha. These results demonstrate the utility of a
   virtual screening protocol to identify novel scaffolds for highly
   selective, cellpermeable inhibitors of JNK-protein interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Stability analysis is a crucial aspect of structural design,
   particularly for beam type structures. This paper addresses the
   development of a complementary-energy based (dual) stability criterion
   for the quasi-static analysis of three-dimensional framed structures
   modeled using the so-called geometrically exact (Reissner-Simo) beam
   theory. The criterion is derived from the well known primal stability
   criterion based on the condition of minimum total potential energy. This
   is accomplished by resorting to the Lagrangian multiplier method
   together with the Legendre transformation. Several numerical benchmark
   problems are analyzed. The analyses are carried out using two dual
   finite element models and their corresponding stability criteria,
   namely, the traditional two-node displacement/rotation-based model with
   the primal stability criterion, and a recently introduced
   equilibrium-based model with the proposed dual stability criterion. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for testing RF receivers that utilizes a
   multitone digital signal generation scheme and relies on the analysis of
   the receiver baseband output to compute the RF performance parameters.
   The proposed method eliminates the cost of expensive RF instrumentation
   on the input side of receiver testing and only requires low-cost on-chip
   baseband digitization at the output of the receiver. The complexity of
   the RF signal generation inherent to standard methods is traded off with
   extensive signal processing in the baseband. The analysis necessary for
   tackling the problem of extracting RF metrics is addressed and presented
   herein. Whereas the proposed test scheme was implemented and
   experimentally verified on a load board for testing UHF receivers,
   generalized use in BIST applications in need of multi-GHz RF stimuli is
   also discussed in the paper. RF performance parameters like Gain, Noise
   Figure (NF), and IIP3 were simulated and measured using both standard
   methods and the proposed method and, the results are shown to be
   accurate to within 0.5 dB for Gain and 1 dB for NF and IIP3.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and testing of a rotor with
   extremely flexible blades, focusing on application to a microhelicopter.
   The goal is to develop rotor blades that are so flexible that they can
   be rolled into a compact volume and stowed inside the rotor hub. The
   design of an 18-in-diameter two-bladed rotor with flexible blades is
   presented. Stiffening and stabilization of the rotor blades are enabled
   by centrifugal forces acting on a tip mass. The relationship between
   blade-design parameters, aeroelastic stability boundaries, and hover
   performance is explored by a systematic set of experiments. It is
   observed that rotational speed and collective pitch angles have a
   significant effect on rotor stability. In addition, a large negative
   spanwise twist is induced in the flexible blades during stable
   operation, resulting in a decreased efficiency compared with rigid rotor
   blades having an identical planform and airfoil section. Different
   approaches to passively tailor the induced twist distribution are
   investigated. The highest efficiency was measured on a configuration
   making use of the propeller moment acting on a tip mass located at an
   index angle to the blade chord. A maximum figure of merit of 0.51 was
   measured at a blade loading of 0.14, which is comparable to the
   efficiency of rigid rotor blades.}},

Volume = {{94-95}},
Pages = {{79-88}},

Abstract = {{Polymers are used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) to increase sweep
   efficiency, but recent experimental and field data suggest that
   viscoelastic polymers such as hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) reduce
   residual oil saturation as well. The observed reduction contradicts
   decades of belief that polymers could not be used to reduce residual oil
   because the additional pressure required to overcome capillary pressure
   is orders of magnitude greater than provided by the more viscous
   polymer. However, additional forces (such as normal stress forces) may
   be significant for viscoelastic fluids that are ignored in analysis of
   purely viscous fluids.
   We perform computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) simulations of
   viscoelastic flow around static oil droplets in geometries
   representative of pore throats. We show that normal forces are
   significant for viscoelastic fluids and increase with De and the total
   force imposed on the droplet may be larger than an equivalent Newtonian
   fluid with the same viscosity. Results indicate that normal forces could
   dominate and the total, effective force would be enough to mobilize
   trapped oil. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The dynamic spatial multinomial probit model: analysis of land use
   change using parcel-level data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{77-88}},

Abstract = {{Many transportation-related behaviors involve multinomial discrete
   response in a temporal and spatial context. These include quality of
   paved roadway sections over time, evolution of land use at the parcel
   level, vehicle purchases by socially networked households, and mode
   choices by individuals residing across adjacent homes or neighborhoods.
   Such responses depend on various influential factors, and can have
   temporal and spatial dependence or autocorrelation. In many cases,
   dynamic spatial-model specifications based on maximum fitness, profit or
   utility may be most appropriate.
   This study develops a dynamic spatial multinomial probit (DSMNP) model
   by pivoting off the ordinary MNP model while incorporating spatial and
   temporal dependencies. The study adds value to existing work by
   addressing polytomous outcomes and space-time data. (Most spatial models
   rely on cross-sectional data sets and/or binary outcomes.) The paper
   first explains how the model reflects behaviors at play, and then
   describes estimation using Bayesian methods, which are of great interest
   in multiple fields. Simulated data sets containing both generic and
   alternative-specific explanatory variables are used to validate the
   model's performance (and that of its associated code). Estimation
   efficiency issues and identification issues are discussed. The model is
   then applied to analyze parcel-level land use changes in Austin, Texas.
   It is found that better accessibility boosts the potential of
   residential development while hampering non-residential development. The
   effects of job and population density, neighborhood income and soil
   slope are also explored, and found to exert variable effects across
   space. It is also found that land development tends to cluster when
   existing development intensity in a neighborhood is low. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Statistical static timing analysis has received wide attention recently
   and emerged as a viable technique for manufacturability analysis. To be
   useful, however, it is important that the error introduced in SSTA be
   significantly smaller than the manufacturing variations being modeled.
   Achieving such accuracy requires careful attention to the delay models
   and to the algorithms applied. In this paper, we propose a new
   sparse-matrix based framework for accurate path-based SSTA, motivated by
   the observation that the number of timing paths in practice is
   sub-quadratic based on a study of industrial circuits and the ISCAS89
   benchmarks. Our sparse-matrix based formulation has the following
   advantages: (a) it places no restrictions on process parameter
   distributions; (b) it can use an accurate polynomial-based delay model
   which takes into account slope propagation naturally; (c) it takes
   advantage of the matrix sparsity and high performance linear algebra for
   efficient implementation. Our experimental results are very promising.

Abstract = {{The problem of minimum-fuel, time-fixed, low-thrust rendezvous is
   addressed with the particular aim of developing a solver to determine
   optimal low-thrust peer-to-peer (P2P) maneuvers, which will be an
   integral part of distributed low-thrust servicing missions for multiple
   satellites. We derive the necessary conditions of optimality for P2P
   refueling maneuvers in a circular planar constellation subject to a
   two-body gravity field. We develop the solver based on an indirect
   optimization technique and use the well-known shooting method to solve
   the two-point boundary value problems associated with the forward and
   return trips or a P2P maneuver. The solver is formulated to consider
   implicitly the n thrust-arc case without requiring a predetermined
   thrust structure. The complete P2P refueling decision simulation
   requires the solution to many nonlinear programming subproblems and,
   therefore, benefits from the fast indirect formulation. The application
   of the tool in the determination of optimal P2P maneuvers required for a
   low-thrust P2P mission for multiple satellites moving in a circular
   orbit is demonstrated. Finally, the paper demonstrates, via numerical
   examples, the benefits of a low-thrust P2P mission compared with the
   impulsive case.}},

Abstract = {{Woven-metal-mesh sand screens, commonly known as premium screens, have
   been used extensively by the industry. Sand-retention testing is often
   executed to evaluate the performance of these screens and to establish
   empirical guidelines for screen-size selection. These tests are tedious,
   however, and the results are prone to artifacts and have been used, at
   best, to correlate trends in sand-retention performance with select
   sand-size-distribution parameters. A new method incorporating results
   from numerical modeling, in addition to experimental data, is presented
   to estimate the mass and size distribution of the produced solids in
   prepack sand-retention tests (SRTs) through premium screens. This method
   provides a fast, reliable correlation to estimate sand production
   through premium mesh screens when the size distribution of the formation
   sand is known.
   This paper presents results from a wide range of pre-pack sand-retention
   experiments. In these tests, which represent complete hole collapse, the
   mass of sand produced and its size distribution over time are measured.
   Results of 3D, discrete-element computer simulations of woven-screen
   geometry placed in contact with granular sandpacks of approximately
   100,000 particles are also presented. On the basis of both the
   simulations and the experiments, a new method for screen selection is
   presented. This method is based on a correlation that allows one to use
   the entire sand-size distribution of the formation sand and to estimate
   the mass and size distribution of the produced sand. The method is
   validated by comparisons with experimental data.
   A new method and new correlations for estimating the mass and size
   distribution of produced solids in prepack tests through premium screens
   are presented. Key differences in sand-retention mechanisms between
   premium screens and wire-wrapped screens (WWSs) have been identified.
   The method uses the entire-formation sand-size distribution (as opposed
   to a single design point), and has been validated with laboratory tests.
   The method also helps in screening anomalous test results.}},

Abstract = {{A slurry-type sand-retention test (SRT) that simulates gradual rock
   failure around the wellbore has been used widely in the industry to
   evaluate the performance of sand-control screens for standalone-screen
   (SAS) applications. Using the test results, screen selection is achieved
   generally on the basis of the relative ranking of screen performances
   rather than absolute performance.
   Chanpura et al. (2011) highlighted recently the drawbacks of the current
   practices in slurry-type SRT procedures and proposed a new testing and
   interpretation methodology. Mondal et al. (2011) proposed simulation
   methods and results that, to the best of our knowledge, modeled screen
   performance numerically for the first time and presented comparisons to
   physical experiments. However, the approach used by Mondal et al. (2011)
   considers cases in which hole collapse occurs on wire-wrap screens
   (WWSs) and simulates ``prepack{''} testing as opposed to the slurry-type
   tests considered in this work.
   In this paper, we present an analytical and a numerical {[}Monte Carlo
   (MC)] approach for the prediction of sand production through sand
   screens with slot geometry. We show that the proposed methods can
   estimate both mass and size distribution of the produced solids in a
   slurry-type SRT, taking into account the full particle-size distribution
   (PSD) of formation sand for WWSs. Simulations show that once the slot
   opening is covered by particles larger than the slot opening, sand
   production becomes negligible unless there is a true ``fines{''}
   problem, which is characterized by a bimodal size distribution. The
   effect of slot-size variation in screen coupons on sand production
   demonstrates the importance of proper quality control or at least
   accurate determination of slot sizes in these tests. The proposed
   methods can be used to estimate sand production in slurry-type SRTs for
   different screen sizes and thereby can enable screen-size selection on
   the basis of a defined acceptable level of sand production. Final screen
   selection can be confirmed through an SRT.}},

Abstract = {{Bismuth oxy-iodide is a potentially interesting visible-light-active
   photocatalyst; yet there is little research regarding its
   photoelectrochemical properties. Herein we report the synthesis of BiOI
   nanoplatelet photoelectrodes by spray pyrolysis on fluorine-doped tin
   oxide substrates at various temperatures. The films exhibited n-type
   conductivity, most likely due to the presence of anion vacancies, and
   optimized films possessed incident photon conversion efficiencies of
   over 20\% in the visible range for the oxidation of I- to I-3(-) at 0.4
   V vs Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile. Visible-light photons (lambda >420 nm)
   contributed approximately 75\% of the overall photocurrent under AM1.5G
   illumination, illustrating their usefulness under solar light
   illumination. A deposition temperature of 260 degrees C was found to
   result in the best performance due to the balance of morphology,
   crystallinity, impurity levels, and optical absorption, leading to
   photocurrents of roughly 0.9 mA/cm(2) at 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. Although the
   films performed stably in acetonitrile, their performance decreased
   significantly upon extended exposure to water, which was apparently
   caused by a loss of surface iodine and subsequent formation of an
   insulating bismuth hydroxide layer.}},

Abstract = {{Strongly coupled bilayer graphene (i.e., AB stacked) grows particularly
   well on commercial ``90-10{''} Cu-Ni alloy foil. However, the mechanism
   of growth of bilayer graphene on Cu-Ni alloy foils had not been
   discovered. Carbon isotope labeling (sequential dosing of (CH4)-C-12 and
   (13)(H-4) and Raman spectroscopic mapping were used to study the growth
   process. It was learned that the mechanism of graphene growth on Cu-Ni
   alloy is by precipitation at the surface from carbon dissolved in the
   bulk of the alloy foil that diffuses to the surface. The growth
   parameters were varied to investigate their effect on graphene coverage
   and isotopic composition. It was found that higher temperature, longer
   exposure time, higher rate of bulk diffusion for C-12 vs C-13, and
   slower cooling rate all produced higher graphene coverage on this type
   of Cu-Ni alloy foil. The isotopic composition of the graphene layer(s)
   could also be modified by adjusting the cooling rate. In addition,
   large-area, AB-stacked bilayer graphene transferrable onto Si/SiO2
   substrates was controllably synthesized.}},

   transferring rG-0 multilayers from a SiO2 substrate onto them. The
   oxidation resistance of these rG-0-coated metal foils was investigated
   by Raman spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and scanning electron
   microscopy after heat treatment at 200 degrees C in air for 2 h. The
   bare metal surfaces were severely oxidized, but the rG-0-coated metal
   surfaces were protected from oxidation. This simple solution process
   using rG-0 is one advantage of the present study.}},

Abstract = {{The intrinsic properties of initially p-type doped graphene (grown by
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD)) can be recovered by buffered oxide etch
   (BOE) treatment, and the dominant factor governing p-type doping is
   identified as the H2O/O-2 redox system. Semi-ionic C-F bonding prevents
   the reaction between the products of the H2O/O-2 redox system and
   graphene. BOE-treated graphene field effect transistors (FETs)
   subsequently exposed to air, became p-type doped due to recovery of the
   H2O/O-2 redox system. In comparison, poly(methyl methacrylate)
   (PMMA)-coated graphene FETs had improved stability for maintaining the

Abstract = {{Highly asymmetric lamellar microdomains, such as those required for many
   lithographic line patterns, cannot be straightforwardly achieved by
   conventional block copolymer self-assembly. We present a conceptually
   new and versatile approach to produce highly asymmetric lamellar
   morphologies by the use of binary blends of block copolymers whose
   components are capable of hydrogen bonding. We first demonstrate our
   strategy in bulk systems and complement the experimental results
   observed by transmission electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray
   scattering with theoretical calculations based on strong stretching
   theory to suggest the generality of the strategy. To illustrate the
   impact on potential lithographic applications, we demonstrate that our
   strategy can be transferred to thin film morphologies. For this purpose,
   we used solvent vapor annealing to prepare thin films with vertically
   oriented asymmetric lamellar patterns that preserve the bulk
   morphological characteristics. Due to the highly asymmetric lamellar
   microdomains, the line width is reduced to sub-10 nm scale, while its
   periodicity is precisely tuned.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{5828-5836}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid, multiscale reservoir simulator has been developed that
   directly substitutes pore-scale models for continuum-scale,
   finite-difference grids. Over 7500 pore scale models (similar to 75
   million pores) are inserted into a similar to 1 m(2) pore-scale region
   around a producing well, which is coupled to an outer, fine-scale
   finite-difference model with 10 000 cell-centered grids. This
   computationally demanding problem is possible because the domain is
   decomposed into manageable subdomains (thousands of pore-scale models
   and one continuum region) and then coupled together using finite-element
   mortars to ensure continuity between the subdomains. Here, flow is
   single-phase, single-component, and steady-state, but the potential of
   the simulator for more complex, near-well flows is demonstrated. A
   priori, direct upscaling and a posteriori, global upscaling are both
   performed, and it is shown that the direct approach results in
   significant inaccuracies in the pressure and flow fields but the global
   upscaling approach results in a good approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Batch process monitoring methods, such as multiway PCA and multiblock

   Nevertheless, a continuous process analytics counterpart has not been

   methodology that defines ``state variables{''} to determine the multiple
   operating points around which a continuous process operates. In this
   manner, the operating region is divided into multiple regions (states)
   and shifts in operating conditions are captured by such state variables.
   Transition trajectories between states are calculated to determine the
   most likely path from one state to another. This methodology is referred
   as multistate analytics and can be implemented in the context of
   empirical monitoring methods, named multistate PLS and multistate PCA. A
   case study using data from carbon dioxide removal process shows that
   multistate analytics is beneficial for statistical monitoring of

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells are a promising option for distributed energy
   stationary power generation that offers efficiencies up to 50\% in
   stand-alone applications, 70\% in hybrid gas turbine applications and
   80\% in cogeneration. To advance SOFC technology sufficiently for
   widespread market penetration, the SOFC must demonstrate improved cell
   lifetime from the status quo. Much research has been performed to
   improve SOFC lifetime using advanced geometries and materials, and in
   this research, we suggest further improving lifetime by designing an
   advanced control algorithm based upon preexisting mechanical stress
   analysis {[}1]. Control algorithms commonly address SOFC lifetime
   related operability objectives using unconstrained, SISO control
   algorithms that seek to minimize thermal transients. While thermal
   fatigue may be one thermal stress driver, these studies often do not
   consider maximum radial thermal gradients or critical absolute
   temperatures in the SOFC. In addition, researchers often discuss
   hot-spots as a critical lifetime reliability issue, but as previous
   stress work demonstrates, the minimum cell temperature is the primary
   thermal stress driver in tubular SOFCs modeled after the Siemens Power
   Generation, Inc. design. In this work, we present a dynamic,
   quasi-two-dimensional model for a high-temperature tubular SOFC combined
   with ejector and prereformer models. The model captures dynamics of
   critical thermal stress drivers and is used as the physical plant for
   closed-loop simulations with a constrained, MIMO model predictive
   control algorithm. Closed-loop simulation results demonstrate effective
   load-following, operability constraint satisfaction, and disturbance

Title = {{Applying Fractional-Flow Theory Under the Loss of Miscibility}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{661-670}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the limits of the Walsh and Lake (WL) method for
   predicting the displacement performance of solvent flood when
   miscibility is not achieved. Despite extensive research on the
   applications of fractional-flow theory, the prediction of flow
   performance under the loss of miscibility has not been investigated
   thoroughly.
   We introduce the idea of an analogous first-contact miscible (FCM) flood
   to study miscibly degraded simultaneous water and gas (SWAG)
   displacements using the WL method. Furthermore, numerical simulation is
   used to validate the WL solution on one oil/solvent pair. In the
   simulations, the loss of miscibility (degradation) is attributed to
   either flow-associated dispersion or insufficient pressure to develop
   the miscibility.
   1D SWAG injection simulations suggest that results of the WL method and
   the simulations are consistent when dispersion is limited. For the 2D
   displacements, the predicted optimal water-alternating-gas (WAG) ratio
   is accurate when the permeable medium is fairly homogeneous with a
   limited crossflow or is heterogeneous with a large lateral correlation
   length (the same size or greater than the interwell spacing).
   The results suggest that the accuracy of the WL method improves as
   crossflow is reduced. In addition, linear growth of the mixing zone with
   time is observed in cases for which the predicted optimal WAG ratio is
   consistent with the simulation results. Hence, we conclude that the WL
   solution is accurate when the mixing zone grows linearly with time.}},

Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant/polymer (SP) and alkali/surfactant/polymer flooding is of
   current interest because of the need to recover residual oil after
   primary and secondary recovery. If designed properly, these
   enhanced-oil-recovery processes can give very high oil recoveries.
   Microemulsion phase behavior plays a central role in process performance
   and is typically measured by performing salinity scans in glass pipettes
   at atmospheric pressure and reservoir temperature using dead crude oil
   from the reservoir of interest. There have been only a few experiments
   reported in the literature on live oil at reservoir pressure and
   temperature, and the importance of those experimental results is
   conflicting.
   This paper investigates the effect of pressure and solution gas on
   microemulsion phase behavior and its impact on oil recovery. We examine
   previous data reported in the literature, and report new measurements
   with live oil to show that the optimum parameters can change
   significantly. The experiments show that while pressure induces a phase
   transition from upper microemulsion (Winsor Type II+) to lower
   microemulsion (Winsor Type II-), solution gas does the opposite. An
   increase in pressure decreases the optimum solubilization ratio and
   shifts the optimum salinity to a larger value. Adding methane to dead
   oil at constant pressure does the reverse. Thus, these effects are
   coupled and both must be taken into account. Using a numerical
   simulator, we show that these changes in the optimum conditions can
   significantly impact oil recovery if not accounted for in the SP design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multiblock-discretization method-the
   enhanced-velocity mixed-finite-element method (EVMFEM) (Wheeler et al.
   2002)-for coupled multiphase flow and reactive-species-transport
   modeling in porous-media applications. The method provides local mass
   balance and a continuous approximation of fluxes across interfaces of
   elements and subdomains. It can treat nonmatching grids, allowing for a
   flexible choice of grid refinements. Further, by distributing the blocks
   among processors such that each block has approximately the same number
   of elements, this method can be implemented efficiently in parallel,
   thereby offering further reductions in computational cost.
   The paper also presents recent application of EVMFEM to challenging
   problems such as compositional flow simulations of CO, sequestration.
   Tests with EVMFEM suggest that it is advantageous to apply grid
   refinements around wells and to areas in which dynamics of
   chemical-species concentration is highest. Allowing for variable grid
   refinements greatly reduces the simulation cost, while preserving
   overall accuracy of the solution. For completeness, a few significant
   analytic results on convergence of the method are stated and referenced,
   omitting proof.
   This work is significant in advancing the discretization and application
   of EVMFEMs in reservoir-simulation development. Problems such as
   transport of chemical species in multiphase flow and CO2 sequestration
   have begun to assume significant importance in decisions regarding the
   preservation of our environment and in the safe and reliable means of
   delivering energy. This paper offers useful methods and some innovative
   future directions to address the huge computational costs involved in
   solving such complex problems.}},

Abstract = {{Reservoir souring refers to the onset of hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
   production during waterflooding. Besides health and safety issues, H2S
   content reduces the value of the produced hydrocarbon. Nitrate injection
   is an effective method to prevent the formation of H2S. Designing this
   process requires the modeling of a complicated set of biogeochemical
   reactions involved in the production of H2S and its inhibition. This
   paper describes the modeling and simulation of biological reactions
   associated with the injection of nitrate to inhibit reservoir souring.
   The model is implemented in a general-purpose adaptive reservoir
   simulator (GPAS). To the best of our knowledge, GPAS is the first
   field-scale reservoir simulator that models reservoir souring treatment.
   The basic mechanism in the biologically mediated generation of H2S is
   the reaction between sulfate in the injection water and fatty acids in
   the formation water in the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB).
   There are proposed mechanisms that describe the effect of nitrate
   injection on souring remediation. Depending on the circumstances, more
   than one mechanism may occur at the same time. These mechanisms include
   the inhibitory effect of nitrite on sulfate reduction, the competition
   between SRB and nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB), and the stimulation of
   nitrate-reducing sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (NR-SOB). For each
   mechanism, we specify the biological species and chemical components
   involved and determine the role of each component in the biological
   reaction. For every biological reaction, a set of ordinary differential
   equations along with differential equations for the transport of
   chemical and biological species are solved. The results of reported
   experiments in the literature are used to find the input parameters for
   field-scale simulations. This reservoir simulator can then predict the
   onset of reservoir souring and the effectiveness of nitrate injection
   and helps in the design of the process. The comprehensive modeling
   accounts for variation in biological system characteristics and
   reservoir conditions that affect the production and remediation of H2S.}},

Abstract = {{A great deal of research has been focused on transient two-phase flow in
   wellbores. However, there is lack of a comprehensive two-fluid model in
   the literature. In this paper, we present an implementation of a
   pseudo-compositional, thermal, fully implicit, transient two-fluid model
   for two-phase flow in wellbores. In this model, we solve gas/liquid mass
   balance, gas/liquid momentum balance, and two-phase energy balance
   equations to obtain five primary variables: liquid velocity, gas
   velocity, pressure, holdup, and temperature. This simulator can be used
   as a stand-alone code or can be used in conjunction with a reservoir
   simulator to mimic wellbore/reservoir dynamic interactions. In our
   model, we consider stratified, bubbly, intermittent, and annular flow
   regimes using appropriate closure relations for interphase and
   wall-shear stress terms in the momentum equations. In our simulation, we
   found that the interphase and wall-shear stress terms for different flow
   regimes can significantly affect the model's results. In addition, the
   interphase momentum transfer terms mainly influence the holdup value.
   The outcome of this research leads to a more accurate simulation of
   multiphase flow in the wellbore and pipes, which can be applied to the
   surface facility design, well-performance optimization, and wellbore
   damage estimation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, traffic assignment problems with stochastic travel cost
   perceptions are reformulated and investigated in a new unconstrained
   nonlinear programming formulation. The objective function of the
   unconstrained formulation consists of two terms, in which the first term
   specifies the routing principle of the target problem through a
   satisfaction function and the sum of the first and second terms denotes
   the system cost or optimization objective. This formulation proves to be
   the Lagrangian dual of a generic primal formulation proposed by Maher et
   al. (2005) for the stochastic system-optimal problem. The primal-dual
   modeling framework presents such a common functional form that can
   accommodate a wide range of different traffic assignment problems. Our
   particular attention is given to the dual formulation in that its
   unconstrained feature opens the door of applying unconstrained
   optimization algorithms for its embraced traffic assignment problems.
   Numerical examples are provided to support the insights and facts
   derived from applying the primal and dual formulations to model
   stochastic system-optimal and user-equilibrium problems and justify the
   conjugate relationship between the primal and dual models. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The multiobjective shortest path problem arises in many transportation
   and logistics applications, either as a stand-alone network routing
   problem or a subroutine of a more complex multiobjective network
   optimization problem. It has been addressed by different solution
   strategies, including labeling methods, ranking methods, constraint
   methods, and parametric methods. Increasing attention has been paid to
   parametric methods in recent years, partially because of its simple
   algorithmic logic and its flexibility of being used in different
   user-preference decision-making environments. The core idea of a
   parametric algorithm is scalarization, by which a multiobjective
   shortest path problem can be tackled by repeatedly solving a
   single-objective subproblem. However, existing parametric algorithms
   suffer two notorious deficiencies, which considerably limit its further
   applications: first, typical subroutines for the single-objective
   subproblem in general cannot capture nonextreme Pareto-optimal paths;
   second, parametric algorithms for biobjective problems cannot be
   directly extended to solving multiobjective problems. This paper
   provides some algorithmic improvements that can partially overcome these
   deficiencies. In particular, the contribution of this work is twofold:
   first, in the biobjective parametric solution framework, we propose an
   approximate label-setting algorithm for the parameterized, constrained
   single-objective subproblem, which is capable of identifying all extreme
   paths and a large percentage (i.e., 85-100\%) of nonextreme paths;
   second, we suggest a general projection scheme that can decompose a
   multiobjective problem into a number of biobjective problems. The
   approximate parametric algorithm runs in polynomial time. The
   algorithmic design and solution performance of the algorithm for
   multiobjective shortest path problems are illustrated, and numerically
   evaluated and compared with a benchmark algorithm in terms of solution
   completeness and efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Binding of the Fc domain of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to Fc gamma receptors
   on leukocytes can initiate a series of signaling events resulting in
   antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and other important
   immune responses. Fc domains lacking glycosylation at N297 have greatly
   diminished Fey receptor binding and lack the ability to initiate a
   robust ADCC response. Earlier structural studies of Fc domains with
   either full length or truncated N297 glycans led to the proposal that
   these glycans can stabilize an ``open{''} Fc conformation recognized by
   Fc gamma receptors. We determined the structure of an E. coli expressed,
   aglycosylated human Fc domain at 3.1 angstrom resolution and observed
   significant disorder in the C'E loop, a region critical for Fc gamma
   receptor binding, as well as a decrease in distance between the C(H)2
   domains relative to glycosylated Fc structures. However, comparison of
   the aglycosylated human Fc structure with enzymatically deglycosylated
   Fc structures revealed large differences in the relative orientations
   and distances between C(H)2 domains. To provide a better appreciation of
   the physiologically relevant conformation of the Fc domain in solution,
   we determined Radii of Gyration (R-g) by small-angle X-ray scattering
   (SAXS) and found that the aglycosylated Fc displays a larger R-g than
   glycosylated Fc, suggesting a more open C(H)2 orientation under these
   conditions. Moreover, the R-g of aglycosylated Fc was reduced by
   mutations at the C(H)2-C(H)3 interface (E382V/M428I), which confer
   highly selective binding to Fc gamma RI and novel biological activities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we show that the optimal receive antenna subset selection
   problem for maximizing the mutual information in a point-to-point MIMO
   system is sub-modular. Consequently, a greedy step-wise optimization
   approach, where at each step, an antenna that maximizes the incremental
   gain is added to the existing antenna subset, is guaranteed to be within
   a (1 - 1/e)-fraction of the global optimal value independent of all
   parameters. For a single-antenna-equipped source and destination with
   multiple relays, we show that the relay antenna selection problem to
   maximize the mutual information is modular and a greedy step-wise
   optimization approach leads to an optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{Although right-ventricular function is an important determinant of
   cardio-pulmonary performance in health and disease, right ventricular
   myocardium mechanical behaviour has received relatively little
   attention. We present a novel experimental method for quantifying the
   mechanical behaviour of transmurally intact, viable right-ventricular
   myocardium. Seven murine right ventricular free wall (RVFW) specimens
   were isolated and biaxial mechanical behaviour measured, along with
   quantification of the local transmural myofibre and collagen fibre
   architecture. We developed a complementary strain energy function based
   method to capture the average biomechanical response. Overall, murine
   RVFW revealed distinct mechanical anisotropy. The preferential alignment
   of the myofibres and collagen fibres to the apex-to-outflow-tract
   direction was consistent with this also being the mechanically stiffer
   axis. We also observed that the myofibre and collagen fibre orientations
   were remarkably uniform throughout the entire RVFW thickness. Thus, our
   findings indicate a close correspondence between the tissue
   microstructure and biomechanical behaviour of the RVFW myocardium, and
   are a first step towards elucidating the structurefunction of
   non-contracted murine RVFW myocardium in health and disease.}},

Abstract = {{The finite-difference time-domain method is one of the most popular for
   wave propagation in the time domain. One of its advantages is the use of
   a structured staggered grid, which makes it simple and efficient on
   modern computer architectures. A drawback, however, is the difficulty in
   approximating oblique boundaries, having to resort to staircase
   approximations. In many scattering problems this means that the grid
   resolution required to obtain an accurate solution is much higher than
   what is dictated by propagation in a homogeneous material. In this paper
   zero boundary data are considered, first for the velocity and then the
   pressure. These two forms of boundary conditions model perfectly rigid
   and pressure-release boundaries, respectively. A simple and efficient
   method to consistently model curved rigid boundaries in two dimensions
   was developed in Tornberg and Engquist {[}J. Comput. Phys. 227,
   6922-6943 (2008)]. Here this treatment is generalized to three
   dimensions. Based on the approach of this method, a technique to model
   pressure-release surfaces with second order accuracy and without
   additional restriction on the timestep is also introduced. The structure
   of the standard method is preserved, making it easy to use in existing
   solvers. The effectiveness is demonstrated in several numerical tests.

   Turbine Airfoil Leading Edge}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{A significant challenge of utilizing coal-derived synthetic fuels for
   gas turbine engines is mitigating the adverse effects of fuel-born
   contaminant deposits on film cooled turbine surfaces. A new experimental
   technique has been developed that simulates the key physical, but not
   the chemical, aspects of coal ash deposition on film cooled turbine
   airfoil leading edges in order to better understand the interaction
   between film cooling and deposition and to produce improved film cooling
   designs. In this large-scale wind tunnel facility, the depositing
   contaminants were modeled with atomized molten wax droplets sized to
   match the Stokes numbers of coal ash particles in the engine conditions.
   The sticking mechanism of the molten contaminants to the turbine
   surfaces was modeled by ensuring the wax droplets remained somewhat
   molten when they arrived at the cooled model surface. The airfoil model
   and wax deposits had thermal conductivities such that they matched the
   Biot numbers of clean and fouled turbine airfoils at engine conditions.
   The behavior of the deposit growth was controlled by adjusting the
   mainstream, coolant, and wax solidification temperatures. Simulated
   deposits were created for a range of test durations, film cooling
   blowing ratios, and controlling temperatures. Inspection of the
   resulting deposits revealed aspects of the flow field that augment and
   suppress deposition. Deposit thickness was found to increase in time
   until an equilibrium thickness was attained. Blowing ratio and the
   difference between mainstream and wax solidification temperatures
   strongly affected characteristics of the deposits. Model surface
   temperatures greatly reduced under the deposits as they developed.

Abstract = {{This paper considers the joint power-allocation and relay-selection
   problems in multiuser cooperative communication networks, where one user
   can only seek a limited number of relays for cooperation. This
   relay-selection degree bound is of practical significance. The goal is
   to optimize the relay selection and power allocation in a distributed
   manner while respecting certain users' quality-of-service (QoS)
   requirements. This problem is challenging due to its combinatorial
   nature, even from a centralized perspective, let alone distributed
   algorithms (or protocols). For this joint optimization problem with
   inherent combinatorial nature, this paper resorts to a layering
   approach. Specifically, the optimal power allocation for a fixed but
   arbitrary relay-selection configuration is carried out in the physical
   layer while the relay selection is done in the media access control
   (MAC) layer. The general idea is to run distributed relay-selection
   schemes based on a time-reversible Markov chain over a distributed
   power-allocation algorithm in the physical layer. It turns out that
   these methods can approximately solve this joint power allocation and
   the relay-selection problem with a certain performance guarantee. More
   importantly, the resulting solution can be implemented in a distributed
   manner. Numerical results are also presented to demonstrate the
   performance of the algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an opportunistic feedback and scheduling scheme for
   multiuser wireless systems. In opportunistic feedback schemes, a set of
   thresholds is assigned to the users, and only users with channel quality
   above the threshold transmit the feedback on channel state information
   (CSI) to the base station. We propose an opportunistic feedback scheme
   that combines techniques from queue/weight-based opportunistic
   scheduling to improve users' delay performance. A set of queue-based
   weights designed to slowly track variations in users' backlog is
   computed; then, each user is assigned a threshold based on the weights.
   The proposed scheme effectively captures heterogeneity in the offered
   loads, which is crucial for delay performance. To that end, we formulate
   a nonconcave maximization problem and propose an approximation algorithm
   that is numerically shown to have high accuracy. By simulation, we show
   that our scheme substantially reduces the mean delay, compared with
   conventional schemes.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{591-602}},

Abstract = {{Low yields of recombinant expression represent a major barrier to the
   physical characterization of membrane proteins. Here, we have identified
   genes that globally enhance the production of properly folded G
   protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in Escherichia coli. Libraries of
   bacterial chromosomal fragments were screened using two separate systems
   that monitor: (i) elevated fluorescence conferred by enhanced expression
   of GPCR-GFP fusions and (ii) increased binding of fluorescent ligand in
   cells producing more active receptor. Three multi-copy hits were
   isolated by both methods: nagD, encoding the ribonucleotide phosphatase
   NagD; a fragment of nlpD, encoding a truncation of the predicted
   lipoprotein NlpD, and the three-gene cluster ptsN-yhbJ-npr, encoding
   three proteins of the nitrogen phosphotransferase system. Expression of
   these genes resulted in a 3- to 10-fold increase in the yields of
   different mammalian GPCRs. Our data is consistent with the hypothesis
   that the expression of these genes may serve to maintain the integrity
   of the bacterial periplasm and to provide a favorable environment for
   proper membrane protein folding, possibly by inducing a fine-tuned
   stress response and/or via modifying the composition of the bacterial

Abstract = {{This study presents a second-order energy return on investment analysis
   to evaluate the mutual benefits of combining an advanced wastewater
   treatment plant (WWTP) (with biological nutrient removal) with algal
   biofuel production. With conventional, independently operated systems,
   algae production requires significant material inputs, which require
   energy directly and indirectly, and the WWTP requires significant energy
   inputs for treatment of the waste streams. The second-order energy
   return on investment values for independent operation of the WWTP and
   the algal biofuels production facility were determined to be 0.37 and
   0.42, respectively. By combining the two, energy inputs can be reduced
   significantly. Consequently, the integrated system can outperform the
   isolated system, yielding a second-order energy return on investment of
   1.44. Combining these systems transforms two energy sinks to a
   collective (second-order) energy source. However, these results do not
   include capital, labor, and other required expenses, suggesting that
   profitable deployment will be challenging. Water Environ. Res., 84, 692

Abstract = {{The semilunar (aortic and pulmonary) heart valves function under
   dramatically different hemodynamic environments, and have been shown to
   exhibit differences in mechanical properties, extracellular matrix (ECM)
   structure, and valve interstitial cell (VIC) biosynthetic activity.
   However, the relationship between VIC function and the unique
   micromechanical environment in each semilunar heart valve remains
   unclear. In the present study, we quantitatively compared porcine
   semilunar mRNA expression of primary ECM constituents, and layer- and
   valve-specific VIC-collagen mechanical interactions under increasing
   transvalvular pressure (TVP). Results indicated that the aortic valve
   (AV) had a higher fibrillar collagen mRNA expression level compared to
   the pulmonary valve (PV). We further noted that VICs exhibited larger
   deformations with increasing TVP in the collagen rich fibrosa layer,
   with substantially smaller changes in the spongiosa and ventricularis
   layers. While the VIC-collagen micromechanical coupling varied
   considerably between the semilunar valves, we observed that the VIC
   deformations in the fibrosa layer were similar at each valve's
   respective peak TVP. This result suggests that each semilunar heart
   valve's collagen fiber microstructure is organized to induce a
   consistent VIC deformation under its respective diastolic TVP.
   Collectively, our results are consistent with higher collagen
   biosynthetic demands for the AV compared to the PV, and that the
   valvular collagen microenvironment may play a significant role in
   regulating VIC function.}},

Abstract = {{Re-investigation of Li insertion into the layers of Li1+xV1-yMyS2 (M =
   Cr, Ni and y = 0 and 0.1, x <= 0.8) reveals that the transformation of
   Li from octahedral to tetrahedral sites in Li1+xVS2 leads to a 1.0 V
   stabilization V(III)/V(II) plateau at 0.1C rate. Substitution of 10
   mol\% Ni for V to form Li1+xV0.9Ni0.1S2 increases the voltage on Li
   insertion by 0.1-0.2 V compared to nominal LiVS2, but it leads to an
   overall decrease in the capacity. An irreversible capacity loss on the
   initial charge/discharge cycle is the result of formation of an SEI
   layer at and below 1 V versus lithium. 10 mol\% substitution of Cr for V
   (i.e. Li1+xV0.9Cr0.1S2) has no effect on the voltage, but it increases
   the capacity fade as the discharge/charge cycles progress. (C) 2012

Title = {{Membrane bending by protein-protein crowding}},
Journal = {{NATURE CELL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{944+}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Curved membranes are an essential feature of dynamic cellular
   structures, including endocytic pits, filopodia protrusions and most
   organelles(1,2). It has been proposed that specialized proteins induce
   curvature by binding to membranes through two primary mechanisms:
   membrane scaffolding by curved proteins or complexes(3,4); and insertion
   of wedge-like amphipathic helices into the membrane(5,6). Recent
   computational studies have raised questions about the efficiency of the
   helix-insertion mechanism, predicting that proteins must cover nearly
   100\% of the membrane surface to generate high curvature(7-9), an
   improbable physiological situation. Thus, at present, we lack a
   sufficient physical explanation of how protein attachment bends
   membranes efficiently. On the basis of studies of epsin1 and AP180,
   proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we propose a third
   general mechanism for bending fluid cellular membranes: protein-protein
   crowding. By correlating membrane tubulation with measurements of
   protein densities on membrane surfaces, we demonstrate that lateral
   pressure generated by collisions between bound proteins drives bending.
   Whether proteins attach by inserting a helix or by binding lipid heads
   with an engineered tag, protein coverage above similar to 20\% is
   sufficient to bend membranes. Consistent with this crowding mechanism,
   we find that even proteins unrelated to membrane curvature, such as
   green fluorescent protein (GFP), can bend membranes when sufficiently
   concentrated. These findings demonstrate a highly efficient mechanism by
   which the crowded protein environment on the surface of cellular
   membranes can contribute to membrane shape change.}},

Abstract = {{The Yee scheme is one of the most popular methods for electromagnetic
   wave propagation. A main advantage is the structured staggered grid,
   making it simple and efficient on modern computer architectures. A
   downside to this is the difficulty in approximating oblique boundaries,
   having to resort to staircase approximations.
   In this paper we present a method to improve the boundary treatment in
   two dimensions by, starting from a staircase approximation, modifying
   the coefficients of the update stencil so that we can obtain a
   consistent approximation while preserving the energy conservation,
   structure and the optimal CFL-condition of the original Yee scheme. We
   prove this in L (2) and verify it by numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This letter proposes simple guidelines to design nanoscale fin-based
   multigate field-effect transistors (FinFETs) for radio frequency
   (RF)/analog applications in terms of fin height and fin spacing.
   Geometry-dependent capacitive and resistive parasitics are evaluated
   using analytic models and are included in a small-signal circuit. It is
   found that reducing the fin-spacing-to-fin-height ratio of FinFETs, as
   long as it is compatible with the process integration, is desirable for
   improving RF performance. This is because the current-gain cutoff
   frequency and the maximum oscillation frequency are affected by
   decreasing parasitic capacitance more than by increasing series
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied channel thickness dependence of InGaAs quantum-well
   field-effect transistors (QWFETs) with high-kappa gate dielectrics.
   Device performances of ultrathin 5- and 10-nm-channel In0.7Ga0.3As
   QWFETs with gate length down to sub-50-nm regime have been investigated.
   Thinning down the channel improves subthreshold characteristics and
   reduces the short-channel effect. The 5-nm In0.7Ga0.3As channel (L-g =
   40 nm) devices exhibit a reduced subthreshold swing (SS) of around 100
   mV/dec and drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) of 128 mV/V compared to
   10-nm In0.7Ga0.3As channel devices (SS of similar to 140 mV/dec and DIBL
   of similar to 275 mV/V). However, the drawback for thinner channel
   devices is that the effective channel mobility also decreases. At
   inversion charge density of 3 x 10(12)/cm(2), 10-nm In0.7Ga0.3As channel
   devices exhibit mobility of 1860 cm(2)/V . s versus mobility of 1460

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate minimum mean squared error (MMSE) based
   amplify-and-forward cooperative multiple antenna relaying systems where
   a non-negligible direct link exists between the source and the
   destination. First, we provide a new design strategy for optimizing the
   relay amplifying matrix. Instead of conventional optimal design
   approaches resorting to an iterative gradient method, we propose a near
   optimal closed-form solution which provides an insight. As relay systems
   with a direct link incur a non-convex problem in general, we exploit the
   decomposable property of the error covariance matrix and a relaxation
   technique imposing a structural constraint on the problem. Next, we
   study the error performance limit of the proposed scheme using
   diversity-multiplexing tradeoff analysis, which leads to several
   interesting observations on MMSE-based cooperative relaying systems.
   Finally, through numerical simulations, we confirm that the proposed
   solution shows the performance very close to the optimum with much
   reduced complexity and the analysis closely matches with simulation
   results.}},

   and analyzed with industrial designs. This paper also shows the
   correlation between the estimated result based on idealized modeling and
   the actual data for real circuits for error coverage, hardware overhead,

   coverage can be achieved with X-canceling MISR configurations and it

   using phase stabilized swept source optical coherence tomography
   (PhS-SSOCT). Wave velocity was measured in phantoms with various
   concentrations of gelatin and therefore different stiffness. Mechanical
   waves of small amplitudes (similar to 10 mu m) were induced by applying
   local mechanical excitation at the surface of the phantom. Using the
   phase-resolved method for displacement measurement described here, the
   wave velocity was measured at various spatially distributed points on
   the surface of the tissue-mimicking gelatin-based phantom. The
   measurements confirmed an anticipated increase in the shear wave
   velocity with an increase in the gelatin concentrations. Therefore, by
   combining the velocity measurements with previously reported
   measurements of the wave amplitude, viscoelastic mechanical properties
   of the tissue such as cornea and lens could potentially be measured.}},

   and the impact model. Experimental work on drop tests is then used to
   validate the code on modeling impact fragmentation. It has been found
   that the developed discrete element code and impact model can reasonably
   simulate rock fragmentation in drop tests. The use of the discrete

Abstract = {{Even though the effect of antibody affinity on neutralization potency is
   well documented, surprisingly, its impact on neutralization breadth and
   escape has not been systematically determined. Here, random mutagenesis
   and DNA shuffling of the single-chain variable fragment of the
   neutralizing antibody 80R followed by bacterial display screening using
   anchored periplasmic expression (APEx) were used to generate a number of
   higher-affinity variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-neutralizing antibody 80R with equilibrium
   dissociation constants (K-D) as low as 37 pM, a >270-fold improvement
   relative to that of the parental 80R single-chain variable fragment
   (scFv). As expected, antigen affinity was shown to correlate directly
   with neutralization potency toward the icUrbani strain of SARS-CoV.
   Additionally, the highest-affinity antibody fragment displayed
   10-fold-increased broad neutralization in vitro and completely protected
   against several SARS-CoV strains containing substitutions associated
   with antibody escape. Importantly, higher affinity also led to the
   suppression of viral escape mutants in vitro. Escape from the
   highest-affinity variant required reduced selective pressure and
   multiple substitutions in the binding epitope. Collectively, these
   results support the hypothesis that engineered antibodies with picomolar
   dissociation constants for a neutralizing epitope can confer
   escape-resistant protection.}},

   naturally embeds the volume constraint on the amount of material

   model as a coupled system and we highlight the dependency of the optimal
   topologies on dimensionless parameters. We consider Isogeometric
   Analysis for the spatial approximation which facilitates encapsulating
   the exactness of the representation of the design domain in the topology
   optimization and is particularly suitable for the analysis of phase
   field problems. We demonstrate the validity of the approach and

Abstract = {{Capping is typically used to control contaminant release from the
   underlying sediments. However, the presence of conventional sediment
   caps will often eliminate or slow natural degradation that might
   otherwise occur at the surface sediment. The objective of this study was
   to explore the potential of a novel reactive capping, an electrode
   enhanced cap for the remediation of PAH contaminated sediment. The study
   on electrode enhanced biodegradation of PAH in slurries showed that
   naphthalene concentration decreased from similar to 1000 to similar to
   50 mu g L-1, and phenanthrene decreased from similar to 150 to similar
   to 30 mu g L-1 in the ElectroBioReactor within 4 days, and the copy
   numbers of PAH degrading genes increased by almost two orders of
   magnitude. In a cap microcosm, two carbon electrodes were placed within
   a sediment cap with an applied potential of 2 V. The anode was placed at
   the sedimentcap interface encouraging oxidizing conditions. Oxidation
   and reduction potential (ORP) profiles showed redox potential
   approximately 60100 mV higher at the sedimentcap interface with the
   application of voltage than in controls. Vertical profiles of
   phenanthrene porewater concentration were obtained by PDMS-coated fiber,
   and results showed that phenanthrene at depth 00.5 cm below the anode
   was degraded to similar to 70\% of the initial concentration within 10
   weeks. PAH degrading genes showed an increase of approximately one order
   of magnitude at the same depth. The no power controls showed no
   degradation of PAH. These findings suggest that electrode enhanced
   capping can be used to control redox potential, provide microbial
   electron acceptors, and stimulate PAH degradation. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Toughening of polyamide 6 (PA6) can be achieved by appropriate addition
   of an elastomeric matrix phase; however, this leads to a loss of
   rigidity and mechanical strength. As a result, much research has been
   directed at obtaining an optimal balance between toughness and rigidity
   for these thermoplastics. The approach explored here is the formation of
   nanocomposites from PA6/acrylonitrilebutadienestyrene (ABS) blends
   prepared by melt mixing with a modified montmorillonite (Cloisite (R)
   30B) and styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer as a compatibilizer. The
   effect of the mixing sequence of the components on the morphology and
   properties is a primary focus. The morphology and mechanical properties
   of the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, electron
   microscopy, and tensile and impact testing. Incorporation of the
   compatibilizer in the PA6/ABS blend increased toughness but decreased
   rigidity. A significant increase of modulus was observed for the
   nanocomposite blend compared with the blend or the matrix. This increase
   was attributed to the exfoliation of organoclay layers in the PA6 matrix
   phase. It was also observed that the morphology of the ABS dispersed
   phase was considerably influenced by the mixture sequence. POLYM. ENG.

Abstract = {{We introduce a finite-difference method to simulate pore scale
   steady-state creeping fluid flow in porous media. First, a geometrical
   approximation is invoked to describe the interstitial space of
   grid-based images of porous media. Subsequently, a generalized Laplace
   equation is derived and solved to calculate fluid pressure and velocity
   distributions in the interstitial space domain. We use a previously
   validated lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) as ground truth for modeling
   comparison purposes. Our method requires on average 17 \% of the CPU
   time used by LBM to calculate permeability in the same pore-scale
   distributions. After grid refinement, calculations of permeability
   performed from velocity distributions converge with both methods, and
   our modeling results differ within 6 \% from those yielded by LBM.
   However, without grid refinement, permeability calculations differ
   within 20 \% from those yielded by LBM for the case of high-porosity
   rocks and by as much as 100 \% in low-porosity and highly tortuous
   porous media. We confirm that grid refinement is essential to secure
   reliable results when modeling fluid flow in porous media. Without grid
   refinement, permeability results obtained with our modeling method are
   closer to converged results than those yielded by LBM in low-porosity
   and highly tortuous media. However, the accuracy of the presented model
   decreases in pores with elongated cross sections.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, calcium sulfoaluminate-belite (CSAB) cement has been
   promoted as a sustainable alternative to Portland cement due to lower
   energy used and less CO2 emitted during production, while providing
   comparable performance. However, a potential problem facing the
   widespread adoption and production of CSAB cement is the cost and
   availability of raw materials and it is therefore desirable to find
   alternative raw materials to keep costs competitive. In this study, two
   CSAB cement clinkers with a similar target phase composition were
   synthesized from combinations of natural and waste materials (coal
   combustion residuals). The two CSAB cement clinkers were compared
   against a CSAB clinker made from reagent-grade chemicals, enabling
   examination of the effects of impurities on performance. Cements made
   from the clinkers were examined for hydration rate, hydration product
   formation, dimensional stability, and compressive strength. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We address the problem of performing simultaneous analog-to-digital
   (A/D) conversion on multi-channel signals using a single A/D converter
   (ADC). Assuming that each input has an unknown sparse representation in
   known dictionaries, we find that multi-channel information can be
   sampled with a single ADC. The proposed ADC architecture consists of a
   mixed signal block and a digital signal processing (DSP) block. The
   channel inputs are sampled by switched-capacitor-based sample-and-hold
   circuits, and then mixed using sequences of plus or minus ones, leading
   to no bandwidth expansion. The resulting discrete-time signals are
   converted to digital sequences by a single ADC or quantizer. At the DSP
   block, each channel is separated from the digitized mixture through
   various separation algorithms that are widely used in compressive
   sensing. For this, we study several techniques for separating the
   mixture of the channel inputs into the sample number of digital
   sequences corresponding to each channel. We show that with an ideal ADC,
   perfect reconstruction of the signals is possible if the input signals
   are sufficiently sparse. We also show simulation results with a 16-bit
   ADC model, and the reconstruction is possible up to the accuracy of the
   ADCs.}},

   have a limited support of this feature. To this end, turbo codes are
   employed together with puncturing and scrambling techniques to match the
   Hamming weight of codewords with the desired dimming rate. We
   demonstrate the decoding performance of the proposed coding scheme under
   iterative decoding and compare it with other existing error correction
   schemes. The simulation results prove that the proposed scheme has
   superior decoding performance, arbitrary dimming rate support, and

Abstract = {{The finite-volume method is now a well-established tool in the numerical
   engineering community for simulation of a wide range of problems in
   fluid and solid mechanics. Its acceptance by the mechanics of
   heterogeneous media community, however, continues to be slow, often
   characterized by confusion with the finite-element method or so-called
   higher-order theories. Herein, we provide a brief historical perspective
   on the evolution of this important technique in the fluid mechanics
   community, its transition to the solution of solid mechanics
   boundary-value problems initiated in Europe in 1988, and the recent
   developments aimed at the solution of unit cell problems of periodic
   heterogeneous media. The differences and similarities with the
   finite-element method are highlighted, and the resulting tangible
   advantages of the finite-volume technique discussed and illustrated.
   Finally, our most recent results in this area are presented which
   demonstrate the method's capability of solving unit cell problems with
   complex architectures in a variety of settings and applications, while
   revealing undocumented effects of interest in the development of new
   material microstructures with targeted response. Recent attempts to
   develop alternative versions of this technique are also discussed,
   together with our ongoing work to generalize the finite-volume
   micromechanics approach in order to further enhance its predictive
   capabilities and efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the ignition delay in hydrogenoxygen combustion and the
   important chain -branching reaction H + O2? OH + O that occurs behind
   the shock waves in shock tube experiments. We apply a stochastic
   Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainties in the theoretical model and
   experimental data. The approach involves a statistical inverse problem,
   which has four components as input information: (a) model, (b) prior
   joint probability density function (PDF) of the uncertain parameters,
   (c) experimental data, and (d) uncertainties in the scenario parameters.
   The solution of this statistical inverse problem is a posterior joint
   PDF of the uncertain parameters from which we can easily extract
   statistical information. We first perform a parametric study to
   investigate how the level of the total uncertainty (which we define as
   the sum of model uncertainty and experimental uncertainty) affects the
   uncertainty in the rate coefficient k1 of the reaction H + O2? OH + O,
   which is most likely expressed by k1=1.73x1023T-2.5exp(-11550/T)
   cm3?mol-1?s-1 over the experimental temperature range 11001472 K. We
   also introduce the idea of irreducible uncertainty when considering
   other parameters in the system. After statistically calibrating the
   parameters modeling the rate coefficient k1, we predict its 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) for different temperature regimes and compare
   the CI against the values of k1 obtained deterministically. Our results
   show that a small uncertainty in gas temperature (+/- 5 K) introduces
   appreciable uncertainty in k1. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{313-320}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates experimentally the synergistic effect of a
   polypropylene (PP) and a nylon (NY) fiber combination to provide
   improved spalling protection of high-strength concrete subjected to
   fire. Optimum levels of fiber contents for spalling protection with a
   less adverse effect on workability are provided based on the results of
   the fire test by varying the NY and PP fiber content. The combination of
   NY and PP fibers shows a synergistic effect on spalling protection; that
   is, by using a combination of NY and PP fibers, the same level of
   spalling protection is achieved using half as much fiber content as that
   when PP or NY fiber is used alone. The combined fibers show no explosion
   occurring even at 0.05\% of NY (0.025\% out of 0.05\%) and PP (0.025\%
   out of 0.05\%) fiber content. By combining both the comparably low
   melting point of PP fiber, which is useful at the early stage of a fire,
   and the larger number of fibers that can be used due to the thinner
   diameter of NY fiber, which is useful at the later stage of fire, the
   combination of the two fibers can improve spalling protection by
   providing connections between pores with low fiber content. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We review tools for structure identification and model-based refinement
   from three-dimensional electron microscopy implemented in our in-house
   software package, VOLROVER 2.0. For viral density maps with icosahedral
   symmetry, we segment the capsid, polymeric, and monomeric subunits using
   techniques based on automatic symmetry detection and multidomain fast
   marching. For large biomolecules without symmetry information, we again
   use our multidomain fast-marching method with manual or fit-based
   multiseeding to segment meaningful substructures. In either case, we
   subject the resulting segmented subunit to secondary structure detection
   when the EM resolution is sufficiently high, and rigid-body structure
   fitting when the corresponding X-ray structure is available. Secondary
   structure elements are identified by three techniques: our earlier
   volume-based and boundary-based skeletonization methods as well as a new
   method, currently in development, based on solving the grassfire flow
   equation. For rigid-body fitting, we adapt our earlier fast
   Fourier-based correlation scheme F2Dock. Our reported segmentation,
   secondary structure elements identification, and rigid-body fitting
   techniques, implemented in VOLROVER 2.0 are applied to the PSB 2011
   cryo-EM modeling challenge data, and our results are briefly compared to
   similar results submitted from other research groups. The comparisons
   show that our techniques are equally capable of segmenting relatively
   accurate subunits from a viral or protein assembly, and that high
   segmentation quality leads in turn to higher-quality results of
   secondary structure elements identification and correlation-based
   rigid-body fitting. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 97:

Abstract = {{Unilateral, below-knee amputees have altered gait mechanics, which can
   significantly affect their mobility. Below-knee amputees lose the
   functional use of the ankle muscles, which are critical during walking
   to provide body support, forward propulsion, leg-swing initiation and
   mediolateral balance. Thus, either muscles must compensate or the
   prosthesis must provide the functional tasks normally provided by the
   ankle muscles. Three-dimensional (3D) forward dynamics simulations of
   amputee and non-amputee walking were generated to identify muscle and
   prosthesis contributions to amputee walking mechanics, including the
   subtasks of body support, forward propulsion, leg-swing initiation and
   mediolateral balance. Results showed that the prosthesis provided body
   support in the absence of the ankle muscles. The prosthesis contributed
   to braking from early to mid-stance and propulsion in late stance. The
   prosthesis also functioned like the uniarticular soleus muscle by
   transferring energy from the residual leg to the trunk to provide trunk
   propulsion. The residual-leg vasti and rectus femoris reduced their
   contributions to braking in early stance, which mitigated braking from
   the prosthesis during this period. The prosthesis did not replace the
   function of the gastrocnemius, which normally generates energy to the
   leg to initiate swing. As a result, lower overall energy was delivered
   to the residual leg. The prosthesis also acted to accelerate the body
   laterally in the absence of the ankle muscles. These results provide
   further insight into muscle and prosthesis function in below-knee
   amputee walking and can help guide rehabilitation methods and device
   designs to improve amputee mobility. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Butadiene-containing polymers such as styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS)
   block copolymers are of a potential use as oxygen scavenging polymers

   applications, oxygen uptake was measured for films made of an SBS
   copolymer and four cobalt catalyst loadings with various thicknesses.
   The oxygen uptake was found to be kinetically limited for thin films
   while diffusion controls the uptake at long times for thick films. The
   thickness of the oxidized region at long oxidation times is termed the
   critical thickness L-c and was quantified by various analyses. Thin
   films (i.e.,L <= 2L(c)) oxidize fully and homogeneously, whereas
   heterogeneous oxidation typically occurs in thicker films (i.e., L >

Abstract = {{Epitaxial anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) films have been grown by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) on Si(001) substrates using a strontium
   titanate (STO) buffer layer grown by molecular beamepitaxy (MBE) to
   serve as a surface template. The growth of TiO2 was achieved using
   titanium isopropoxide and water as the co-reactants at a substrate
   temperature of 225-250 degrees C. To preserve the quality of the
   MBE-grown STO, the samples were transferred in-situ from the MBE chamber
   to the ALD chamber. After ALD growth, the samples were annealed in-situ
   at 600 C in vacuum (10(-7) Pa) for 1-2 h. Reflection high-energy
   electron diffraction was performed during the MBE growth of STO on
   Si(001), as well as after deposition of TiO2 by ALD. The ALD films were
   shown to be highly ordered with the substrate. At least four unit cells
   of STO must be present to create a stable template on the Si(001)
   substrate for epitaxial anatase TiO2 growth. X-ray diffraction revealed
   that the TiO2 films were anatase with only the (004) reflection present
   at 2 theta=38.2 degrees, indicating that the c-axis is slightly reduced
   from that of anatase powder (2 theta=37.9 degrees). Anatase TiO2 films
   up to 100 nm thick have been grown that remain highly ordered in the
   (001) direction on STO-buffered Si(001) substrates. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{272-278}},

Abstract = {{An in situ sulfur deposition route has been developed for synthesizing
   sulfur-carbon composites as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur
   batteries. This facile synthesis method involves the precipitation of
   elemental sulfur at the interspaces between carbon nanoparticles in
   aqueous solution at room temperature. The product has been characterized
   by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy, charge-discharge measurements, and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. The sulfur-carbon composite cathode with 75
   wt.\% active material thus obtained exhibits a remarkably high first
   discharge capacity of 1116 mAh g(-1) with good cycle performance,
   maintaining 777 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. The significantly improved
   electrochemical performance of the sulfur-carbon composite cathode is
   attributed to the carbon-wrapped sulfur network structure, which
   suppresses the loss of active material during charging/discharging and
   the migration of the polysulfide ions to the anode (i.e., shuttling
   effect). The integrity of the cathode structure during cycling is
   reflected in low impedance values observed after cycling. This facile in
   situ sulfur deposition route represents a low-cost approach to obtain
   high-performance sulfur-carbon composite cathodes for rechargeable Li-S
   batteries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{We use a recently proposed metric, termed the point-to-set correlation
   functions, to probe the molecular weight dependence of the relevant
   static length scales in glass-forming oligomeric chain liquids of 4, 5,
   8, and 10 repeat units. In agreement with the results for simple,
   monatomic fluids, we find that static length scales of the oligomers
   increase monotonically when the temperature is lowered towards the glass
   transition temperature of the fluid. More interestingly, the static
   length scale increases with increasing chain length. Within the bounds
   of error in our simulations, the static length scale appears to scale as
   the radius of gyration of the oligomer, but with a prefactor, which is
   much larger than unity and which grows with the temperature. The
   preceding behavior contrasts with the length scales extracted from the
   radial distribution function of the oligomer system, which is
   practically independent of the chain length. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{We investigate the thermal stability of helical hydrophobic oligomers
   using a three-dimensional, water-explicit lattice model and the
   Wang-Landau Monte Carlo method. The degree of oligomer helicity is
   controlled by the parameter epsilon(mm) < 0, which mimics
   monomer-monomer hydrogen bond interactions leading to the formation of
   helical turns in atomistic proteins. We vary vertical bar
   epsilon(mm)vertical bar between 0 and 4.5 kcal/mol and therefore
   investigate systems ranging from flexible homopolymers (i.e., those with
   no secondary structure) to helical oligomers that are stable over a
   broad range of temperatures. We find that systems with l vertical bar
   epsilon(mm)vertical bar <= 2.0 kcal/mol exhibit a broad thermal
   unfolding transition at high temperature, leading to an ensemble of
   random coils. In contrast, the structure of conformations involved in a
   second, low-temperature, transition is strongly dependent on le,).
   Weakly helical oligomers are observed when le,,1 <= 1.0 kcal/mol and
   exhibit a low-temperature, cold-unfolding-like transition to an ensemble
   of strongly water-penetrated globular conformations. For higher vertical
   bar epsilon(mm)vertical bar (1.7 kcal/mol < vertical bar
   epsilon(mm)vertical bar <= 2.0 kcal/mol), cold unfolding is suppressed,
   and the low temperature conformational transition becomes a
   ``crystallization{''}, in which a ``molten{''} helix is transformed into
   a defect free helix. The molten helix preserves >= 50\% of the helical
   contacts observed in the ``crystal{''} at a lower temperature. When
   vertical bar epsilon(mm)vertical bar = 4.5 kcal/mol, we find that
   conformational transitions are largely suppressed within the range of
   temperatures investigated.}},

Abstract = {{An active negative index metamaterial that derives its gain from an
   electron beam is introduced. The metamaterial consists of a stack of
   equidistant parallel metal plates perforated by a periodic array of
   holes shaped as complementary split-ring resonators. It is shown that
   this structure supports a negative-index transverse magnetic
   electromagnetic mode that can resonantly interact with a relativistic
   electron beam. Such a metamaterial can be used as a coherent radiation
   source or a particle accelerator.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of physical aging in confined polymer glasses have
   revealed that aging behavior in confinement often differs from bulk
   behavior. This study used DSC to characterize physical aging and
   structural relaxation in bulk polysulfone (PSF) and co-extruded
   multilayered films of PSF and an olefin block copolymer (OBC) that have
   average PSF layer thicknesses of 640 nm, 260 nm, and 185 nm. The films
   were aged isothermally at 170 degrees C, and the recovered enthalpy upon
   reheating was measured over time. The films with 640 nm and 260 nm PSF
   layers had aging rates very similar to that of bulk PSF, while the film
   with 185 nm PSF layers had an aging rate slightly greater than the bulk
   value. The cooling rate dependence of the limiting fictive temperature
   (T-f') in multilayered and bulk PSF samples was also characterized.
   Values of T-f' were similar for all films at each cooling rate. The
   results of this work are in general agreement with our previous gas
   permeation aging study of multilayered PSF films aged at 35 degrees C,
   in which the effect of layer thickness on aging behavior was minimal.
   This stands in contrast to studies with thin, freestanding PSF films,
   which exhibit accelerated aging relative to bulk and have aging rates
   that depend strongly on film thickness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effects of network structure of crosslinked poly(methyl

   investigated through gravimetric integral sorption studies. Samples of
   P(MMA-co-(EG)(x)DMA) were synthesized via an iniferter-mediated,
   thermally-initiated free radical polymerization procedure to produce
   polymers with controlled variations in network structure by altering the
   comonomer feed ratios of dimethacrylate crosslinkers and changing the
   crosslinker interchain bridge length. The front velocity in the Case II
   transport regime was shown to scale directly with the square root of the
   crosslinking density over varied thermal and structural conditions, and
   increasing the crosslinker interchain bridge length moved the observed
   penetrant transport behavior towards the Fickian regime. The
   demonstrated ability to tune the dynamic transport behavior through
   modification of the polymer network structure holds promise as a means
   to mitigate solvent-induced material failure due to cracking and crazing
   encountered in many high-tech applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes have been grown, for the first time, on
   graphite felt (N-CNT/GF) by a chemical vapor deposition approach and
   examined as an advanced electrode for vanadium redox flow batteries
   (VRFBs). The unique porous structure and nitrogen doping of N-CNT/GF
   with increased surface area enhances the battery performance
   significantly. The enriched porous structure of N-CNTs on graphite felt
   could potentially facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte, while the
   N-doping could significantly contribute to the enhanced electrode
   performance. Specifically, the N-doping (i) modifies the electronic
   properties of CNT and thereby alters the chemisorption characteristics
   of the vanadium ions, (ii) generates defect sites that are
   electrochemically more active, (iii) increases the oxygen species on CNT
   surface, which is a key factor influencing the VRFB performance, and
   (iv) makes the N-CNT electrochemically more accessible than the CNT.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion of reduced graphene oxide (RG-O) into natural rubber (NR) was
   found to dramatically enhance the mechanical, electrical, and thermal
   properties of NR However, property improvements were strongly dependent
   upon the processing history and nanocomposite morphology. Co-coagulating
   a stable RG-O suspension with NR latex afforded a weblike morphology
   consisting of platelet networks between the latex particles, while
   two-roll mill processing broke down this structure, yielding a
   homogeneous and improved dispersion. The physical properties of RG-O/NR
   vulcanizates with both morphologies were compared over a range of
   loadings; it was found that the network morphology was highly beneficial
   for thermal and electrical conductivity properties and greatly increased
   stiffness but was detrimental to elongation. A detailed comparative
   analysis of composite models found the Guth equation gave excellent fit
   to modulus data of the milled samples when taking the shape factor as
   equal to the platelet aspect ratio quantified from transmission electron
   microscopy analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the influence of sequence polydispersity upon the phase
   behavior and interfacial characteristics of gradient copolymers. By
   adapting the algorithmic procedure proposed for random copolymers, we
   design sequences of varying blockiness and compositional
   polydispersities for specified composition profiles of the gradient
   copolymers. Using the sequences so generated, we studied the dependence
   of the spinodals, the phase behavior, and interfacial properties of
   gradient copolymers as a function of gradient strengths and blockiness
   of the sequences. We demonstrate that the interplay between
   compositional polydispersity and the overall blockiness of the sequences
   can play a significant role in determining the morphologies, phase
   behavior, and interfacial activity of gradient copolymer systems. In
   systems wherein the inherent blockiness of the sequences is small, such
   as in gradient copolymers with weak gradient strengths, the introduction
   of such polydispersity and blockiness effects leads to substantial
   changes in the self-assembly behavior and interfacial properties. In
   contrast, in systems for which the inherent blockiness is already large,
   such as in gradient copolymers with strong gradient strengths, the
   effects of sequence correlations upon the self-assembly characteristics
   and interfacial properties are seen to be much more mitigated.}},

   Cathodes containing the S-MIEC composite were prepared and evaluated in
   half cells by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. The S-MIEC
   composite cathode shows excellent electrochemical stability as the MIEC
   facilitates ion and electron transfer and capture intermediate
   polysulfides within the electrodes. The MIEC in the composite electrodes
   forms a porous, 3D heterostructure providing good electrochemical
   contact upon cycling as indicated by scanning electron microscopy and

Abstract = {{Investigation of the high-voltage Li{[}Ni0.5-xMn1.5+x]O-4 (x = 0, 0.05,
   0.08) spinets prepared at temperatures of T <= 900 degrees C and given
   different thermal treatments has shown that the solubility limit for
   oxygen vacancies in the disordered spinet phase is small at 600 degrees
   C. With x = 0, long-range ordering of Ni2+ and Mn4+ and elimination of
   all oxygen vacancies occurs after an anneal at 700 degrees C. Above 700
   degrees C, a reversible transition from spinet to rock-salt is
   initiated, to accommodate oxygen loss. A sample quenched from 900
   degrees C into liquid nitrogen traps some rock-salt second phase; the
   volume fraction of rock-salt phase decreases with oxygen uptake to 600
   degrees C. However, upon slow cooling (1 degrees C min(-1)) from 900
   degrees C, the particles have time to eliminate most of the rock-salt
   phase by 700 degrees C; upon further cooling below 700 degrees C, the
   spinet phase and the oxygen gain are retained. However, the spinet phase
   retains oxygen vacancies and attendant Mn3+ with only short-range order
   of Ni and Mn. The rock-salt phase lowers sharply the electrochemical
   capacity of the quenched sample; but retention of Mn3+ in the
   slow-cooled sample improves the electrochemical performance relative to
   that of an oxygen-stoichiometric spinet formed by annealing at 700
   degrees C. The Mn-rich Li{[}Ni0.45Mn1.55]O-4 sample annealed at 700
   degrees C exhibits a segregation of a long-range-ordered spinet phase
   and a Ni-deficient spinet phase having a larger fraction near the
   particle surface. Removal of the Ni4+/Ni2+ redox reactions from the
   surface stabilizes the electrochemical performance at 55 degrees C, but
   the problem of Mn2+ dissolution resulting from surface
   disproportionation of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and Mn4+ remains.}},

   reflection-free transport even in the presence of large disorder.
   Technologically, nonreciprocal photonic devices, such as optical
   isolators and circulators, play critical roles in optical communication
   and computing technologies because of their ability to eliminate
   cross-talk and feedback. Nevertheless, most known natural materials that
   lack local time-reversal symmetry require strong external fields and
   function only in a limited range of the electromagnetic spectrum. By
   taking advantage of metamaterials capable of translating the property of
   unidirectional active electronic circuits into effective dielectric
   response, we introduce a microwave gyrotropic metamaterial that does not
   require an external magnetic bias. Strong bulk Faraday-like effects,
   observed in both simulations and experiments, confirm nonreciprocity of
   the effective medium. This approach is scalable to many other
   wavelengths, and it also illustrates an opportunity to synthesize exotic
   electromagnetic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The perovskite SmFeO3 exhibits type-G antiferromagnetic ordering at T-N
   approximate to 670 K and an easy axis rotation transition at T-SR
   approximate to 480 K. Owing to the peculiar site anisotropy of
   rare-earth Sm3+, the moment on Sm3+ is oriented antiparallel to the
   canted spin from the Fe+ sublattice along the a axis at T < T-SR. The
   development of the magnetic moment on Sm3+ as temperature decreases
   makes it possible to balance the two magnetic moments at T-comp. The
   application of a moderate external magnetic field along the a axis can
   trigger an abrupt reversal of the moment on Sm3+ and the canted spin
   relative to the external field at a temperature around T-comp. We report
   here a study of the field-induced magnetic-moment reversal in a single
   crystal SmFeO3 by measuring the magnetization and specific heat with the
   external field along different crystallographic axes.}},

   repertoire of admissible `seed-less' targets}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{To better understand the recognition mechanism of RISC and the
   repertoire of guide-target interactions we introduced G: U wobbles and
   mismatches at various positions of the microRNA (miRNA) `seed' region
   and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the resulting
   Ago-miRNA: mRNA ternary complexes. Our simulations reveal that many
   modifications, including combinations of multiple G: U wobbles and
   mismatches in the seed region, are admissible and result in only minor
   structural fluctuations that do not affect overall complex stability.
   These results are further supported by analyses of HITS-CLIP data.
   Lastly, introduction of disruptive mutations revealed a bending motion
   of the PAZ domain along the L1/L2 `hinge' and a subsequent opening of
   the nucleic-acid-binding channel. Our findings suggest that the spectrum
   of a miRNA's admissible targets is different from what is currently
   anticipated by the canonical seed-model. Moreover, they provide a likely
   explanation for the previously reported sequence-dependent regulation of
   unintended targeting by siRNAs.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a parallel fully implicit domain decomposition algorithm for
   solving optimization problems constrained by time-dependent nonlinear
   partial differential equations. In particular, we study the boundary
   control of unsteady incompressible NavierStokes equations. After an
   implicit discretization in time, a fully coupled sparse nonlinear
   optimization problem needs to be solved at each time step. The class of
   full space LagrangeNewtonKrylovSchwarz algorithms is used to solve the
   sequence of optimization problems. Among optimization algorithms, the
   fully implicit full space approach is considered to be the easiest to
   formulate and the hardest to solve. We show that
   LagrangeNewtonKrylovSchwarz, with a one-level restricted additive
   Schwarz preconditioner, is an efficient class of methods for solving
   these hard problems. To demonstrate the scalability and robustness of
   the algorithm, we consider several problems with a wide range of
   Reynolds numbers and time step sizes, and we present numerical results
   for large-scale calculations involving several million unknowns obtained
   on machines with more than 1000 processors. Copyright (c) 2012 John

   that over a range of conditions spanning a increase in solvent density,
   the oligomer transforms into a compact, strongly water-penetrated
   conformation at low temperature. This contrasts with thermal unfolding
   at high temperature, where the system ``denatures{''} into an extended

Abstract = {{Recent studies have suggested that complex muscle activity during
   walking may be controlled using a reduced neural control strategy
   organized around the co-excitation of multiple muscles, or modules.
   Previous computer simulation studies have shown that five modules
   satisfy the sagittal-plane biomechanical sub-tasks of 2D walking. The
   present study shows that a sixth module, which contributes primarily to
   mediolateral balance control and contralateral leg swing, is needed to
   satisfy the additional non-sagittal plane demands of 3D walking. Body
   support was provided by Module 1 (hip and knee extensors, hip abductors)
   in early stance and Module 2 (plantarflexors) in late stance. In early
   stance, forward propulsion was provided by Module 4 (hamstrings), but
   net braking occurred due to Modules 1 and 2. Forward propulsion was
   provided by Module 2 in late stance. Module 1 accelerated the body
   medially throughout stance, dominating the lateral acceleration in early
   stance provided by Modules 4 and 6 (adductor magnus) and in late stance
   by Module 2, except near toe-off. Modules 3 (ankle dorsiflexors, rectus
   femoris) and 5 (hip flexors and adductors except adductor magnus)
   accelerated the ipsilateral leg forward in early swing whereas Module 4
   decelerated the ipsilateral leg prior to heel-strike. Finally, Modules
   1, 4 and 6 accelerated the contralateral leg forward prior to and during
   contralateral swing. Since the modules were based on experimentally
   measured muscle activity, these results provide further evidence that a
   simple neural control strategy involving muscle activation modules
   organized around task-specific biomechanical functions may be used to
   control complex human movements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Does the Left Atrial Appendage Morphology Correlate With the Risk of
   Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation? Results From a Multicenter
   Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study investigated the left atrial appendage (LAA) by
   computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
   categorize different LAA morphologies and to correlate the morphology
   with the history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA).
   Background LAA represents one of the major sources of cardiac thrombus
   formation responsible for TIA/stroke in patients with atrial
   fibrillation (AF).
   Methods We studied 932 patients with drug-refractory AF who were
   planning to undergo catheter ablation. All patients underwent cardiac CT
   or MRI of the LAA and were screened for history of TIA/stroke. Four
   different morphologies were used to categorize LAA: Cactus, Chicken
   Wing, Windsock, and Cauliflower.
   Results CT scans of 499 patients and MRI scans of 433 patients were
   analyzed (age 59 +/- 10 years, 79\% were male, and 14\% had CHADS(2)
   {[}Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age >75, Diabetes mellitus,
   and prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack] score >= 2). The
   distribution of different LAA morphologies was Cactus (278 {[}30\%]),
   Chicken Wing (451 {[}48\%]), Windsock (179 {[}19\%]), and Cauliflower
   (24 {[}3\%]). Of the 932 patients, 78 (8\%) had a history of ischemic
   stroke or TIA. The prevalence of pre-procedure stroke/TIA in Cactus,
   Chicken Wing, Windsock, and Cauliflower morphologies was 12\%, 4\%,
   10\%, and 18\%, respectively (p = 0.003). After controlling for CHADS(2)
   score, gender, and AF types in a multivariable logistic model, Chicken
   Wing morphology was found to be 79\% less likely to have a stroke/TIA
   history (odd ratio: 0.21, 95\% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.91, p =
   0.036). In a separate multivariate model, we entered Chicken Wing as the
   reference group and assessed the likelihood of stroke in other groups in
   relation to reference. Compared with Chicken Wing, Cactus was 4.08 times
   (p = 0.046), Windsock was 4.5 times (p = 0.038), and Cauliflower was 8.0
   times (p = 0.056) more likely to have had a stroke/TIA.
   Conclusions Patients with Chicken Wing LAA morphology are less likely to
   have an embolic event even after controlling for comorbidities and
   CHADS(2) score. If confirmed, these results could have a relevant impact
   on the anticoagulation management of patients with a low-intermediate
   risk for stroke/TIA. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012;60:531-8) (C) 2012 by the

Title = {{Mechanism of thermal conductivity suppression in doped silicon studied
   with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{We examined the underlying mechanisms for thermal conductivity
   suppression in crystalline silicon by substitutional doping with
   different elements (X = boron, aluminum, phosphorus, and arsenic). In
   particular, the relative effects of doping-induced mass disorder, bond
   disorder, and lattice strain were assessed using nonequilibrium
   molecular dynamics simulations. Stillinger-Weber potential parameters
   for Si-X interatomic interactions were optimized by fitting to relevant
   atomic forces from first-principles calculations. We first calculated
   the thermal conductivity variation of B-doped Si as a function of dopant
   concentration; the result shows excellent agreement with existing
   experimental data, indicating the reliability of our force-field-based
   simulations. At the dopant concentration of about 5 x 10(20) cm(-3), the
   Si thermal conductivity value is predicted to be reduced from 137W/mK at
   300 K in undoped Si to 18/39/57/78 W/mK in As/B/P/Al-doped Si. Our study
   demonstrates that the mass disorder effect is primarily responsible for
   the thermal conductivity suppression in the As-and B-doped cases,
   whereas the bond disorder contribution is found to be more important
   than the mass disorder contribution in the Al-and P-doped cases; for all
   these systems, the lattice strain effect turns out to play a minor role
   in the reduction of lattice thermal conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{A high pulse repetition frequency ultrasound system for an ex vivo
   measurement of mechanical properties of an animal crystalline lens was
   developed and validated. We measured the bulk displacement of
   laser-induced microbubbles created at different positions within the
   lens using nanosecond laser pulses. An impulsive acoustic radiation
   force was applied to the microbubble, and spatiotemporal measurements of
   the microbubble displacement were assessed using a custom-made high
   pulse repetition frequency ultrasound system consisting of two 25 MHz
   focused ultrasound transducers. One of these transducers was used to
   emit a train of ultrasound pulses and another transducer was used to
   receive the ultrasound echoes reflected from the microbubble. The
   developed system was operating at 1 MHz pulse repetition frequency.
   Based on the measured motion of the microbubble, Young's moduli of
   surrounding tissue were reconstructed and the values were compared with
   those measured using the indentation test. Measured values of Young's
   moduli of four bovine lenses ranged from 2.6 +/- 0.1 to 26 +/- 1.4 kPa,
   and there was good agreement between the two methods. Therefore, our
   studies, utilizing the high pulse repetition frequency ultrasound
   system, suggest that the developed approach can be used to assess the
   mechanical properties of ex vivo crystalline lenses. Furthermore, the
   potential of the presented approach for in vivo measurements is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of SF6 plasma treatment of Al2O3 on InP substrate have been
   investigated in this paper. Electrical characteristics including drive
   current, effective channel mobility, transconductance, subthreshold
   swings, etc., have been compared for devices with SF6 plasma treatment
   at different power (P = 30 or 50 W) for different time (t = 3, 5, or 7
   min). With 5 min SF6 plasma treatment at power = 30W, the maximum drive
   current is increased by 20\% to 60.2 mu A/mu m and effective channel
   mobility is increased by 36.7\% to 1099 cm(2)/V s for devices on InP
   substrate with 7 nm Al2O3 (EOT similar to 3.4 nm and W/L = 600 mu m/10
   mu m). It is believed S and F atoms are incorporated into Al2O3 bulk and

   trap density are achieved by SF6 plasma treatment at optimal power with
   optimal time duration. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Free-standing ZnO nanocrystals simultaneously doped with Fe and Cu with

   antiferromagnetic interactions between Fe sites without any magnetic
   ordering down to the lowest temperature investigated, samples doped
   simultaneously with Fe and Cu show a qualitative departure in exhibiting
   ferromagnetic interactions, with suggestions of ferromagnetic order at
   low temperature. XAS measurements establish the presence of Fe2+ and
   Fe3+ ions, with the concentration of the trivalent species increasing in
   the presence of Cu doping, providing direct evidence of the Fe2+ + Cu2+
   sic Fe3+ + Cu+ redox couple being correlated with the ferromagnetic
   property. Using DFT, the unexpected ferromagnetic nature of these

Abstract = {{We present ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of liquid and
   amorphous silicon dioxide. The interatomic forces in our simulations are
   calculated using real-space pseudopotentials, which were constructed
   using density-functional theory. Our simulations are carried out using
   Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (i.e., the electronic structure
   problem is solved by performing fully self-consistent calculations for
   each time step). Using a subspace filtering iteration technique, we
   avoid solving the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue with ``standard{''}
   diagonalization methods. We consider systems with up to 192 atoms (64
   SiO2 units) in a periodic supercell for simulations over 20 ps. The
   liquid and amorphous ensembles are formed by thermally quenching random
   configurations of silicon and oxygen atoms. We compare our liquid and
   amorphous simulations with previously performed Car-Parrinello molecular
   dynamic simulations and with experiment. In particular, we examine the
   possible formation of two-membered rings, which were not observed in
   previous simulations using quantum forces. We attribute this difference
   to a ``biased{''} initial configuration, which inhibits the formation of
   two-membered rings. We also compare the structural properties of our
   simulated amorphous systems with neutron diffraction measurements and
   find good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic loading rates can significantly affect the behavior of
   reinforced concrete (RC) elements. However, few data are available to
   quantify these effects. Shaking table tests allow the study of loading
   rate phenomena; however, they suffer from difficulties in assessing
   causality (direct assessment of causes on effects) and are expensive to
   conduct. An alternative is to test individual RC elements by directly
   imparting high-velocity loading protocols. However, multiactuator setups
   are necessary to achieve seismically representative loading and boundary
   conditions, which entails particularly challenging control requirements.
   This investigation makes use of recent advances in real-time testing
   hardware to study the effects of loading rates on the structural
   response of lightly confined RC columns. A pioneering test setup in
   which three actuators are controlled independently at high velocities
   was used to test a series of columns until axial collapse. The
   experimental challenges and column behavior are discussed. DOI:

Abstract = {{In this two-part work, seismic behavior and design of steel moment
   frames with masonry infills are investigated systematically. In this
   first part, the ``infill strength ratio{''} (the ratio of the story
   shear strength of infills to the story shear strength of the bare frame)
   is shown to have a fundamental effect on the seismic behavior of an
   infilled frame. This fundamental effect is demonstrated using pushover
   analysis of an example steel moment frame with masonry infills in
   uniformly infilled and open ground story configurations. In general,
   infill strength ratios greater than about 0.35 are associated with

Abstract = {{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as powerful accelerators
   for many regular algorithms that operate on dense arrays and matrices.
   In contrast, we know relatively little about using GPUs to accelerate
   highly irregular algorithms that operate on pointer-based data
   structures such as graphs. For the most part, research has focused on
   GPU implementations of graph analysis algorithms that do not modify the
   structure of the graph, such as algorithms for breadth-first search and
   strongly-connected components.
   In this paper, we describe a high-performance GPU implementation of an
   important graph algorithm used in compilers such as gcc and LLVM:
   Andersen-style inclusion-based points-to analysis. This algorithm is
   challenging to parallelize effectively on GPUs because it makes
   extensive modifications to the structure of the underlying graph and
   performs relatively little computation. In spite of this, our program,
   when executed on a 14 Streaming Multiprocessor GPU, achieves an average
   speedup of 7x compared to a sequential CPU implementation and
   outperforms a parallel implementation of the same algorithm running on
   16 CPU cores.
   Our implementation provides general insights into how to produce
   high-performance GPU implementations of graph algorithms, and it
   highlights key differences between optimizing parallel programs for
   multicore CPUs and for GPUs.}},

Abstract = {{We form coronas of serum proteins on gold nanorods (NRs) coated with
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). These coronas can be exploited
   for their ability to hold small molecular therapeutics at a capacity
   much higher (similar to 5-10 x) than what covalent conjugation
   strategies can achieve. Coronas are loaded with DNA oligonucleotides and
   Doxorubicin, showing that they can hold species of either negative or
   positive charge. Payload capacity varies with assembly strategy, ionic
   strength, and loading concentration. Payload release can be achieved by
   increasing the temperature or by ultrafast laser excitation of the NRs
   at their longitudinal surface plasmon resonance. DNA leakage from the
   corona is minimal within the first 3 days of preparation, although Dox
   leakage was more significant. The coronas also stabilize the NRs in
   buffer and biological media. This study demonstrates the biological
   utility of the protein corona around nanomaterials, contrasting the
   common view of the corona as an undesirable biological response.}},

Abstract = {{Oak wood lignin, which was separated from the wood using dissolution in
   the ionic liquid 1-methyl-3-ethylimidazolium acetate and subsequent
   precipitation, was successfully depolymerized in the acidic ionic liquid
   1-H-3-methylimidazolium chloride under mild conditions (110-150 degrees
   C). Based on gel permeation chromatography results, an increase in
   temperature from 110 to 150 degrees C increased the rate of reaction,
   but did not significantly change the final size of the lignin fragments.
   Nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy were utilized to
   demonstrate that the depolymerization proceeded via a hydrolysis
   reaction that cleaved the alkyl-aryl ether linkages. Coupling of the
   lignin fragments was also shown to occur in the reaction mixture. These
   hydrolysis results are consistent with the literature on acid catalyzed
   depolymerization of lignin in conventional solvents and with recent
   model compound studies involving guaiacylglycerol-beta-guaiacyl ether
   and veratrylglycerol-beta-guaiacyl ether done in acidic ionic liquids.

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{925-943}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Although algal biofuels possess great potential, profitable production
   is quite challenging. Much of this challenge is rooted in the
   thermodynamic constraints associated with producing fuels with high
   energy, low entropy, and high exergy from dispersed materials. In this
   study, a preliminary thermodynamic analysis is presented that calculates
   the energy, entropy, and exergy of the intermediate products for algal
   biocrude production. These values are also used in an initial attempt to
   characterize the thermodynamic efficiency of that system. The production
   pathway is simplified by assuming ideal solutions throughout. Results
   for the energy and exergy efficiencies, and the first-order energy and
   exergy return on investment, of the system are given.
   The summary finding is that the first-order energy return on investment
   in the best case considered could be as high as 520, as compared to 1.7
   x 10(-3) in the experimental unit under development. While this analysis
   shows that significant improvement may be possible, the ultimate
   thermodynamic efficiency of algal biofuels likely lies closer to the
   moderate case examined here, which yielded a first-order energy return
   on investment of 10. For perspective, the first-order energy return on
   investment for oil and gas production has been estimated in the
   literature to be similar to 35. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we extend the distributed power control problem for

   one-to-many transmission scenarios. We assume a user-centric wireless
   network where the end users play the roles of decision makers. We
   formulate the power control problem as a noncooperative game. New
   challenges arise due to the coupling issues among power strategy spaces
   of distributed end users, which make standard Nash equilibrium based
   noncooperative game approach inapplicable. Indeed, our problem turns out
   to be a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP). Resorting to
   variational inequality theory, we show several fundamental properties of
   the GNEP. Then we propose a penalty-based distributed algorithm IP(2)JA,
   which possesses favorable properties for practical implementation.

Abstract = {{There are two main mechanisms by which cells become multidrug resistant
   (MDR): by increasing drug efflux pumps on the cell membrane and by
   increasing anti-apoptotic pathways. The use of nanotechnology to develop
   nanodelivery systems has allowed researchers to overcome limitations of
   antineoplastic drugs by increasing the solubility of the drug and
   decreasing the toxicity to healthy tissues. By encapsulating drugs into
   nanoparticles that bypass the efflux pumps, drug efflux is reduced,
   hence increasing the intracellular concentration of the drug. siRNA has
   the ability to disrupt cellular pathways by knocking down genes, opening
   the door to down regulating anti-apoptotic pathways.
   The use of nanocarriers to deliver siRNA, prevents both renal clearance
   and RNase degradation by protecting siRNA chains, increasing their half
   life in blood. It has been suggested that codelivering drugs and siRNA
   together in the same delivery system would be more effective in
   overcoming resistance of cancer cells than co-treatment of cancer cells
   with delivery systems carrying either siRNA or drugs. In this study we
   discuss the progress of nanoscale co-delivery systems in overcoming
   multidrug cancer resistance. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a general approach to describe large amplitude motions (LAM)
   with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) in molecules or reaction
   intermediates, which is useful for the computation of thermochemical or
   kinetic data. The kinetic part of the LAM Lagrangian is derived using a
   Z-matrix internal coordinate representation within a new numerical
   procedure. This derivation is exact for a classical system, and the
   uncertainties on the prediction of observable quantities largely arise
   from uncertainties on the LAM potential energy surface (PES) itself. In
   order to rigorously account for these uncertainties, we present an
   approach based on Bayesian theory to infer a parametrized physical model
   of the PES using ab initio calculations.. This framework allows for
   quantification of uncertainties associated with a PES model as well as
   the forward propagation of these uncertainties to the quantity of
   interest. A selection and generalization of some treatments accounting
   for the coupling of the LAM with other internal or external DOF are also
   presented. Finally, we discuss and validate the approach with two
   applications: the calculation. of the partition function of 1,3
   butadiene and the calculation of the high-pressure reaction rate of the
   CH3 + H -> CH4 recombination.}},

   (2011){[}, we present a rigorous analytical model applicable to mantle
   cloaking of cylindrical objects using 1D and 2D sub-wavelength conformal
   frequency selective surface (FSS) elements. The model is based on
   Lorenz-Mie scattering theory which utilizes the two-sided impedance
   boundary conditions at the interface of the sub-wavelength elements. The
   FSS arrays considered in this work are composed of ID horizontal and
   vertical metallic strips and 2D printed (patches, Jerusalem crosses, and
   cross dipoles) and slotted structures (meshes, slot-Jerusalem crosses,
   and slot-cross dipoles). It is shown that the analytical grid-impedance
   expressions derived for the planar arrays of sub-wavelength elements may
   be successfully used to model and tailor the surface reactance of
   cylindrical conformal mantle cloaks. By properly tailoring the surface
   reactance of the cloak, the total scattering from the cylinder can be
   significantly reduced, thus rendering the object invisible over the
   range of frequencies of interest (i.e., at microwaves and far-infrared).
   The results obtained using our analytical model for mantle cloaks are
   validated against full-wave numerical simulations. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{A Bivariate Multinomial Probit Model for Trip Scheduling: Bayesian
   Analysis of the Work Tour}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{405-424}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{As tour-based methods for activity and travel participation patterns
   replace trip-based methods, time-of-day (TOD) choice modeling remains
   problematic. in practice, most travel demand model systems handle tour
   scheduling via joint-choice multinomial logit (MNL) models, which suffer
   from the well-known independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption.
   This paper introduces a random utility maximization model of tour
   scheduling called the bivariate multinomial probit. This specification
   enables correlations across TOD alternatives, both outbound and return
   (on a tour) and over time slots (in a day). The model is estimated in a
   Bayesian setting on work-tour data from the San Francisco Bay Area with
   30-minute time slots at most times of day (for both outbound and inbound
   journeys). Empirical results suggest that a variety of individual,
   household, and tour characteristics have reasonable effects on
   scheduling behavior. For instance, older persons typically pursue work
   tours at earlier times of day, part-time workers pursue their work tours
   later, and those with additional activities and tours tend to arrive
   slightly later and leave much earlier than those undertaking only a
   single tour, everything else constant. The model outperforms a
   comparable MNL, while offering reasonable implications under a variety
   of road-tolling scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofibers possess high surface area to volume ratios and are
   particularly attractive for a variety of applications including tissue
   regeneration, drug delivery, fiber-reinforced composites, filtration,
   and protective clothing. Though the production of nanofibers from common
   thermoplastic polymers is relatively well-demonstrated, processing
   constraints have limited high throughput manufacturing of nanofibers
   from high performance polymers. This has in turn limited broad
   technological exploitation of polymer nanofibers in areas such as hot
   chemical filtration or high-performance lightweight composites for
   aerospace and defense applications. We report here that nanofibers can
   be produced in a solventless high throughput process from polymers such
   as poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) using a newly developed technology
   termed Forcespinning that employs centrifugal force to attenuate fibers.
   Our investigations also show that these nanofibers have a high
   crystallinity and enhanced molecular orientation which is important for
   realizing desirable physical and chemical properties of many
   high-performance polymer fibers}},

Abstract = {{We study an intermittently connected network (ICN) composed of multiple
   clusters of wireless nodes. Within each cluster, nodes can communicate
   directly using the wireless links. However, these clusters are far away
   from each other such that direct communication between the clusters is
   impossible except through ``mobile{''} contact nodes. These mobile
   contact nodes are data carriers that shuffle between clusters and
   transport data from the source to the destination clusters. There are
   several applications of our network model, such as clusters of mobile
   soldiers connected via unmanned aerial vehicles. Our work here focuses
   on a queue-based cross-layer technique known as the back-pressure
   algorithm. The algorithm is known to be throughput-optimal, as well as
   resilient to disruptions in the network, making it an ideal candidate
   communication protocol for our intermittently connected network. In this
   paper, we design a back-pressure routing/rate control algorithm for
   ICNs. Though it is throughput-optimal, the back-pressure algorithm has
   several drawbacks when used in ICNs, including long end-to-end delays,
   large number of potential queues needed, and loss in throughput due to
   intermittency. We present a modified back-pressure algorithm that
   addresses these issues. We implement our algorithm on a 16-node
   experimental testbed and present our experimental results in this paper.}},

Title = {{Directed Evolution of Xylose Isomerase for Improved Xylose Catabolism

Abstract = {{The heterologous expression of a highly functional xylose isomerase
   pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae would have significant advantages
   for ethanol yield, since the pathway bypasses cofactor requirements
   found in the traditionally used oxidoreductase pathways. However, nearly
   all reported xylose isomerase-based pathways in S. cerevisiae suffer
   from poor ethanol productivity, low xylose consumption rates, and poor
   cell growth compared with an oxidoreductase pathway and, additionally,
   often require adaptive strain evolution. Here, we report on the directed
   evolution of the Piromyces sp. xylose isomerase (encoded by xylA) for
   use in yeast. After three rounds of mutagenesis and growth-based
   screening, we isolated a variant containing six mutations (E15D, E114G,
   E129D, T142S, A177T, and V433I) that exhibited a 77\% increase in
   enzymatic activity. When expressed in a minimally engineered yeast host
   containing a gre3 knockout and tall and XKS1 overexpression, the strain
   expressing this mutant enzyme improved its aerobic growth rate by
   61-fold and both ethanol production and xylose consumption rates by
   nearly 8-fold. Moreover, the mutant enzyme enabled ethanol production by
   these yeasts under oxygen-limited fermentation conditions, unlike the
   wild-type enzyme. Under microaerobic conditions, the ethanol production
   rates of the strain expressing the mutant xylose isomerase were
   considerably higher than previously reported values for yeast harboring
   a xylose isomerase pathway and were also comparable to those of the
   strains harboring an oxidoreductase pathway. Consequently, this study
   shows the potential to evolve a xylose isomerase pathway for more
   efficient xylose utilization.}},

Abstract = {{The tremendous capacity gains promised by space division multiple access
   (SDMA) depend critically on the accuracy of the transmit channel state
   information. In the broadcast channel, even without any network
   interference, it is known that such gains collapse due to interstream
   interference if the feedback is delayed or low rate. In this paper, we
   investigate SDMA in the presence of interference from many other
   simultaneously active transmitters distributed randomly over the
   network. In particular we consider zero-forcing beamforming in a
   decentralized (ad hoc) network where each receiver provides feedback to
   its respective transmitter. We derive closed-form expressions for the
   outage probability, network throughput, transmission capacity, and
   average achievable rate and go on to quantify the degradation in network
   performance due to residual self-interference as a function of key
   system parameters. One particular finding is that as in the classical
   broadcast channel, the per-user feedback rate must increase linearly
   with the number of transmit antennas and SINR (in dB) for the full
   multiplexing gains to be preserved with limited feedback. We derive the
   throughput-maximizing number of streams, establishing that single-stream
   transmission is optimal in most practically relevant settings. In short,
   SDMA does not appear to be a prudent design choice for
   interference-limited wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing interest in low-permeability gas plays, foam({*})
   fracturing fluids are now well established as a viable alternative to
   traditional fracturing fluids. Present practices in energized fracturing
   treatments remain, nonetheless, rudimentary in comparison to other
   fracturing-fluid technologies because of our limited understanding of
   multiphase fluid-loss and phase behavior occurring in these complex
   fluids. This paper assesses the fluid-loss benefits introduced by
   energizing the fracturing fluid.
   A new laboratory apparatus has been specifically designed and built for
   measuring the leakoff rates for both gas and liquid phases under dynamic
   fluid-loss conditions. This paper provides experimental leakoff results
   for linear guar gels and for N-2/guar foam-based fracturing fluids under
   a wide range of fracturing conditions. In particular, the effects of the
   rock permeability, the foam quality, and the pressure drop are
   investigated. Analysis of dynamic leakoff data provides an understanding
   of the complex mechanisms of viscous invasion and filter-cake formation
   occurring at the pore scale.
   This study presents data supporting the superior fluid-loss behavior of
   foams, which exhibit minor liquid invasion and limited damage. It also
   shows direct measurements of the ability of the gas component to leakoff
   into the invaded zone, thereby increasing the gas saturation around the
   fracture and enhancing the gas productivity during flowback. Our
   conclusions not only confirm but add to the findings of McGowen and
   Vitthal (1996a, b) for linear gels and the findings of Harris (1985) for
   nitrogen foams.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Islets of myocytes within fibrofatty scars represent the
   substrate for reentrant ventricular arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right
   ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Electroanatomic mapping can reliably
   identify such areas.
   OBJECTIVE To prospectively test the association between late and
   fragmented electrograms within scar and arrhythmic events in patients
   with ARVC.
   METHODS High-density right ventricle electroanatomic mapping was
   performed in 32 patients with ARVC without history of cardiac arrest or
   sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Standard definitions of
   electroanatomic scars and fragmented, isolated, and very late potentials
   were used. All patients received an implantable
   cardioverter-defibrillator for the primary prevention of sudden death.
   RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 25 +/- 7 months, 12 (38\%) patients
   received appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock for
   sustained ventricular arrhythmias. With the exception of a higher rate
   of previous syncope (P = .053), patients with arrhythmic events at
   follow-up did not differ from those who remained free from arrhythmic
   events in terms of other clinical variables, including cardiac magnetic
   resonance findings. Electroanatomic scars were present in all patients.
   The distribution and extent of electroanatomic scars were similar in the
   2 groups (38 +/- 25 cm(2) vs 33 +/- 20 cm(2); P = .51). However,
   patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock had a higher
   prevalence of fragmented electrograms (92\% vs 20\%; P < .001), of
   isolated late potentials (75\% vs 20\%; P < .004), and of very late
   potentials (67\% vs 25\%; P = .030). Fragmented electrograms were the
   only variable independently associated with arrhythmic events at
   follow-up (hazard ratio 21; P = .015).
   CONCLUSION The presence of fragmented and delayed electrograms within
   the scar predicts arrhythmic events in ARVC.}},

   experimentally. The displacement process was visualized with the aid of
   a computed tomography (CT) scanner. CT data were analyzed to obtain
   water saturation profiles at different times. Pressure drops measured
   over core segments were recorded to determine foam mobility. It was
   found that foam undergoes a sharp transition from a weak to a strong
   state at a critical gas saturation of S-gc = 0.75 +/- 0.02. This effect
   was interpreted successfully by the rise of foam yield stress as gas
   saturation exceeds the S-gc. It is suggested that confined jamming is
   the most likely mechanism responsible for the mobility transition.}},

   showed that 2-ethoxyethanol (2-EE) provides superior lipid recovery (>
   150-200 \%) compared to other common extraction solvents such as
   chloroform:methanol or hexane. Extractions of wet and dry algal biomass
   showed that 2-EE was more effective at extracting lipids from wet rather
   than dried algal pellets. To analyze lipid content we used normal-phase
   HPLC with parallel quantitation by an evaporative light scattering
   detector and a mass spectrometer. Analysis of crude lipid extracts
   showed that all major lipid classes could be identified and quantified
   and revealed a surprisingly large amount of saturated hydrocarbons (HC).
   This HC fraction was isolated from extracts of bioreactor-grown algae
   and further analyzed by HPLC/MS, NMR, and GC/MS. The results showed that
   the sample consisted of a mixture of saturated, straight- and
   branched-chain HC of different chain lengths. These algal HC could
   represent an alternative biofuel to triacylglycerols (TAG) that could
   feed directly into the current petroleum infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Delivering high perceptual quality video over wireless channels is
   challenging due to the changing channel quality and the variations in
   the importance of one source packet to the next for the end-user's
   perceptual experience. Leveraging perceptual metrics in concert with
   link adaptation to maximize perceptual quality and satisfy real-time
   delay constraints is largely unexplored. We introduce an APP/MAC/PHY
   cross-layer architecture that enables optimizing perceptual quality for
   delay-constrained scalable video transmission. We propose an online
   QoS-to-QoE mapping technique to quantify the loss visibility of packets
   from each video layer using the ACK history and perceptual metrics. At
   the PHY layer, we develop a link adaptation technique that uses the
   QoS-to-QoE mapping to provide perceptually-optimized unequal error
   protection per layer according to packet loss visibility. At the APP
   layer, the source rate is adapted by selecting the set of temporal and
   quality layers to be transmitted based on the channel statistics, source
   rates, and playback buffer state. The proposed cross-layer optimization
   framework allows the channel to adapt at a faster time scale than the
   video codec. Furthermore, it provides a tradeoff between playback buffer
   occupancy and perceptual quality. We show that the proposed architecture
   prevents playback buffer starvation, provides immunity against
   short-term channel fluctuations, regulates the buffer size, and achieves
   a 30\% increase in video capacity versus throughput-optimal link
   adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{The unpredictability of the wireless medium poses a major challenge to
   delivering a high quality of experience (QoE) for real-time video
   services. Bursty co-channel interference is a prominent cause of
   wireless throughput variability, which leads to video QoE degradation,
   even for a fixed average channel quality. In this paper, we propose and
   analyze a network-level resource management algorithm termed
   interference shaping to smooth out the throughput variations (and hence
   improve the QoE) of video users by decreasing the peak rate of
   co-channel best effort users. Wireless link capacity variations are
   mapped to the real-time video packet loss rate, and the interference
   shaping QoE gain for video users is quantified by benchmarking against a
   modified multi-scale structural similarity (H-MS-SSIM) index. H-MS-SSIM
   is an accurate perceptual video quality metric that incorporates the
   important hysteresis effect whereby the current QoE (which is
   subjective) may strongly depend on the recent past. The proposed
   technique increases mean QoE and reduces the QoE variability over time,
   with a net perceptual increase of about 2-3x in illustrative settings
   while incurring insignificant decrease in the QoE for co-channel best
   effort users. Interference shaping can be implemented in both unicast
   and multicast real-time video streaming with much higher potential gains
   for multicast.}},

Abstract = {{The recent advances in graphene isolation and synthesis methods have
   enabled potential applications of graphene in nanoelectronics and
   thermal management, and have offered a unique opportunity for
   investigation of phonon transport in two-dimensional materials. In this
   review, current understanding of phonon transport in graphene is
   discussed along with associated experimental and theoretical
   investigation techniques. Several theories and experiments have
   suggested that the absence of interlayer phonon scattering in suspended
   monolayer graphene can result in higher intrinsic basal plane thermal
   conductivity than that for graphite. However, accurate experimental
   thermal conductivity data of clean suspended graphene at different
   temperatures are still lacking. It is now known that contact of graphene
   with an amorphous solid or organic matrix can suppress phonon transport
   in graphene, although further efforts are needed to better quantify the
   relative roles of interface roughness scattering and phonon leakage
   across the interface and to examine the effects of other support
   materials. Moreover, opportunities remain to verify competing theories
   regarding mode specific scattering mechanisms and contributions to the
   total thermal conductivity of suspended and supported graphene,
   especially regarding the contribution from the flexural phonons. Several
   measurements have yielded consistent interface thermal conductance
   values between graphene and different dielectrics and metals. A
   challenge has remained in establishing a comprehensive theoretical model
   of coupled phonon and electron transport across the highly anisotropic
   and dissimilar interface. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In the face of large-scale process variations, statistical timing
   methodology has advanced significantly over the last few years, and
   statistical path selection takes advantage of it in at-speed testing. In
   deterministic path selection, the separation of path selection and test
   generation is known to require time consuming iteration between the two
   processes. This paper shows that in statistical path selection, this is
   not only the case, but also the quality of results can be severely
   degraded even after the iteration. To deal with this issue, we consider
   testability in the first place by integrating a satisfiability (SAT)
   solver, and this necessitates a new statistical path selection method.
   We integrate the SAT solver in a novel way that leverages the conflict
   analysis of modern SAT solvers, which provides more than 4X speedup
   without special optimizations of the SAT solver for this particular
   application. Our proposed method is based on a generalized path
   criticality metric whose properties allow efficient pruning. Our
   experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 47\% better
   quality of results on average, and up to 361X speedup compared to
   statistical path selection followed by test generation.}},

   computationally appealing, given the availability of platforms optimized
   for DCT computation. The approach relies on a simple Bayesian inference
   model to predict image quality scores given certain extracted features.
   The features are based on an NSS model of the image DCT coefficients.
   The estimated parameters of the model are utilized to form features that
   are indicative of perceptual quality. These features are used in a
   simple Bayesian inference approach to predict quality scores. The
   resulting algorithm, which we name BLIINDS-II, requires minimal training
   and adopts a simple probabilistic model for score prediction. Given the
   extracted features from a test image, the quality score that maximizes
   the probability of the empirically determined inference model is chosen
   as the predicted quality score of that image. When tested on the LIVE
   IQA database, BLIINDS-II is shown to correlate highly with human
   judgments of quality, at a level that is competitive with the popular
   SSIM index.}},

Abstract = {{A new beamforming strategy is proposed for multiuser systems with N
   transmit antennas at the transmitter and M ? N single antenna receivers.
   The proposed scheme remarkably improves on the classical spatial
   division multiple access, and achieves the same data rates as spatial
   multiplexing for all users but with significantly superior
   performance/diversity gain. When compared with the Bell labs layered
   spacetime system, the symbol rate is the same and the performance is
   much superior because of the presence of diversity gain. In addition,
   unlike the Bell labs layered spacetime system, the receivers do not need
   to know each other's vector channels. Finally, the proposed algorithm is
   based on dirty-paper coding, but does not require much complexity and is
   implementable. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides a simple moving-grid scheme which is based on a
   modified conservative form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
   for flow around a moving rigid body. The modified integral form is
   conservative and seeks the solution of the absolute velocity. This
   approach is different from previous conservative differential forms
   {[}1-3] whose reference frame is not inertial. Keeping the reference
   frame being inertial results in simpler mathematical derivation to the
   governing equation which includes one dyadic product of velocity vectors
   in the convective term, whereas the previous {[}2,3] needs to obtain the
   time derivative with respect to non-inertial frames causing an
   additional dyadic product in the convective term. The scheme is
   implemented in a second-order accurate Navier-Stokes solver and
   maintains the order of the accuracy. After this verification, the scheme
   is validated for a pitching airfoil with very high frequencies. The
   simulation results match very well with the experimental results
   {[}4,5], including vorticity fields and a net thrust force. This airfoil
   simulation also provides detailed vortical structures near the trailing
   edge and time-evolving aerodynamic forces that are used to investigate
   the mechanism of the thrust force generation and the effects of the
   trailing edge shape. The developed moving-grid scheme demonstrates its
   validity for a rapid oscillating motion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Coupling wave and circulation models is vital in order to define shelf,
   nearshore and inland hydrodynamics during a hurricane. The intricacies
   of the inland floodplain domain, level of required mesh resolution and
   physics make these complex computations very cycle-intensive.
   Nonetheless, fast wall-clock times are important, especially when
   forecasting an incoming hurricane.
   We examine the performance of the unstructured-mesh, SWAN+ADCIRC wave
   and circulation model applied to a high-resolution, 5M-vertex,
   finite-element SL16 mesh of the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana. This
   multi-process, multi-scale modeling system has been integrated by
   utilizing inter-model communication that is intra-core. The modeling
   system is validated through hindcasts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
   (2005), Gustav and Ike (2008) and comprehensive comparisons to wave and
   water level measurements throughout the region. The performance is
   tested on a variety of platforms, via the examination of output file
   requirements and management, and the establishment of wall-clock times
   and scalability using up to 9,216 cores. Hindcasts of waves and storm
   surge can be computed efficiently, by solving for as many as 2.3a
   <...10(12) unknowns per day of simulation, in as little as 10 minutes of

Abstract = {{A new algorithm is presented to solve constrained nonlinear optimal

   systems. The algorithm, called HDDP, is a hybrid variant of differential
   dynamic programming, a proven second-order technique that relies on
   Bellman's Principle of Optimality and successive minimization of
   quadratic approximations. The new hybrid method incorporates nonlinear
   mathematical programming techniques to increase efficiency: quadratic
   programming subproblems are solved via trust region and range-space
   active set methods, an augmented Lagrangian cost function is utilized,
   and a multiphase structure is implemented. In addition, the algorithm
   decouples the optimization from the dynamics using first- and
   second-order state transition matrices. A comprehensive theoretical
   description of the algorithm is provided in this first part of the two
   paper series. Practical implementation and numerical evaluation of the
   algorithm is presented in Part 2.}},

Abstract = {{In the first part of this paper series, a new solver, called HDDP, was
   presented for solving constrained, nonlinear optimal control problems.
   In the present paper, the algorithm is extended to include practical
   safeguards to enhance robustness, and four illustrative examples are
   used to evaluate the main algorithm and some variants. The experiments
   involve both academic and applied problems to show that HDDP is capable
   of solving a wide class of constrained, nonlinear optimization problems.
   First, the algorithm is verified to converge in a single iteration on a
   simple multi-phase quadratic problem with trivial dynamics.
   Successively, more complicated constrained optimal control problems are
   then solved demonstrating robust solutions to problems with as many as 7
   states, 25 phases, 258 stages, 458 constraints, and 924 total control
   variables. The competitiveness of HDDP, with respect to general-purpose,
   state-of-the-art NLP solvers, is also demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Tropical cyclone inundation potential on the Hawaiian Islands of Oahu

Journal = {{OCEAN MODELLING}},

Volume = {{52-53}},
Pages = {{54-68}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The lack of a continental shelf in steep volcanic islands leads to
   significant changes in tropical cyclone inundation potential, with wave
   setup and runup increasing in importance and wind driven surge
   decreasing when compared to more gently-sloped mainland regions. This is
   illustrated through high resolution modeling of waves, surge, and runup
   on the Hawaiian Islands of Oahu and Kauai. A series of hurricane waves
   and water levels were computed using the SWAN + ADCIRC models for a
   suite of 643 synthetic storm scenarios, while local wave runup was
   evaluated along a series of 1D transects using the phase-resolving model
   Bouss1D. Waves are found to be an extremely important component of the
   inundation, both from breaking wave forced increases in storm surge and
   also from wave runup over the relatively steep topography. This is clear
   in comparisons with debris lines left by Hurricane Iniki on the Island
   of Kauai, where runup penetration is much greater than still water
   inundation in most instances. The difference between steeply-sloping and
   gently-sloping topographies was demonstrated by recomputing Iniki with
   the same landfall location as Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. Surge was
   greatly increased for the mild-slope Iniki-in-Louisiana case, while pure
   wind surge for Iniki-in-Kauai was very small.
   For the entire suite of storms, maxima on Kauai show predicted
   inundation largely confined to a narrow coastal strip, with few
   locations showing more than a few hundred meters of flooding from the
   shoreline. As expected, maximum flooded areas for the 643 storms were
   somewhat greater than the Iniki inundation.
   Oahu has significantly more low-lying land compared to Kauai, and
   consequently hypothetical tropical cyclone landfalls show much more
   widespread inundation. Under direct impact scenarios, there is the
   potential for much of Honolulu and most of Waikiki to be inundated, with
   both still water surge and wave runup contributing. Other regions of
   Oahu show inundation confined to a more narrow coastal strip, although
   there is still much infrastructure at risk.
   Even for very strong storms in Oahu and Kauai, maximum still water surge
   is relatively small, and does not exceed 3 m in any storm modeled. In
   contrast, hurricane waves several kilometers from shore regularly exceed
   10 m due to the lack of a continental shelf. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Unlike the molecular imprinting of small molecule templates, molecularly
   imprinted polymers specific to large templates (> 1,500 Da), have
   achieved limited success to date. Conformational stability of these
   labile macromolecules is one of the main factors that prevent the direct
   extension of successful procedures from the small molecule regime. We
   continue our systematic investigation of the effect of common components
   in macromolecular MIPs on the conformation of protein templates.
   Circular dichroism was used to show that frequently employed monomers
   and crosslinkers induce significant changes in the secondary structures
   of lysozyme and bovine hemoglobin. The extent to which this change
   occurs, at ligand concentrations far below what are typically used
   reported work, is cause for concern and provides as rational explanation
   for the lack of success in this arena. This is because a change in the
   template structure prior to polymerization would lead to the binding
   sites formed during polymerization to be specific to this alternate
   conformation. Subsequent studies with the macromolecule in its native
   state and the crosslinked network would not be successful. Using this
   information as a guide, we offer suggestions as to where work in
   macromolecular imprinted polymers should focus going forward in order
   for these antibody mimics to reach their vast potential as a new class
   of biomedical diagnostic devices.}},

Abstract = {{A recently developed dynamic surface roughness model (Anderson and
   Meneveau, J Fluid Mech 679:288-314, 2011) for large-eddy simulation
   (LES) of atmospheric boundary-layer flow over multi-scale topographies
   is applied to boundary-layer flow over several types of fluvial-like
   landscapes. The landscapes are generated numerically with simulation of
   a modified Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation (Passalacqua et al., Water
   Resour Res 42:WOD611, 2006). These surfaces possess the fractal-like
   channel network and anisotropic features often found in real terrains.
   The dynamic model is shown to lead to accurate flow predictions when the
   surface-height distributions exhibit power-law scaling (scale
   invariance) in the prevalent mean flow direction. In those cases, the
   LES provide accurate predictions (invariant to resolution) of mean
   velocity profiles. Conversely, some resolution dependence is found for
   applications in which the landscape's streamwise spectra do not exhibit
   pure power-law scaling near wavenumbers corresponding to the LES grid
   resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Task scheduling and core mapping have a significant impact on the
   overall performance of network on chip (NOC). In this paper, a unified
   task scheduling and core mapping algorithm called UNISM is proposed for
   different NOC architectures including regular mesh, irregular mesh and
   custom networks. First, a unified model combining scheduling and mapping
   is introduced using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Then, a
   novel graph model is proposed to consider the network irregularity and
   estimate communication energy and latency, since the number of network
   hops is not accurate enough for irregular mesh and custom networks. To
   make the MILP-based UNISM scalable, a heuristic is employed to speed up
   our method. Compared with two previous state-of-the-art works,
   experimental results show that more than 15\% and 11.5\% improvement on
   the execution time is achieved with similar energy consumption on
   average for regular mesh NOC. For irregular and custom NOC, the
   improvement is 27.3\% and 14.5\% on the execution time with 24.3\% and
   18.5\% lower energy. Moreover, our method is scalable for large
   benchmarks in terms of runtime.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a low cost, passive wireless dielectric constant
   and conductivity sensor using a microfabricated inductor with
   interdigitated capacitors (IDC). A self-resonant-structure (SRS) is
   designed by incorporating IDC electrodes in the inter-winding space of
   the inductor. The distributed capacitance and conductance of the sensor
   is affected by dielectric constant (epsilon) and conductivity (sigma) of
   its environment or material under test (MUT). The epsilon and sigma can
   be used to provide information about the surrounding environment. This
   serves as an impedance transducer changing the resonant frequency and
   phase dip of the SRS. The SRS is interrogated using a non-contact
   inductively coupled reader coil. The change in resonance frequency and
   phase dip of the SRS is used to detect material properties of the
   environment/MUT. The relationship between sensor layout and coupling
   factor between sensor and reader is investigated. Optimizations of the
   coupling factor based on this relationship are discussed. IDC design
   trade-offs between the sensor's sensitivity and coupling factor are also
   investigated. The sensor's response to variety of liquid MUTs with a
   wide range of dielectric constant and conductivity is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to improve the reactivity of metakaolin-cement mixtures
   using ZnO additions. Kaolinite samples with 0.1-1 wt\% ZnO were calcined
   at temperature intervals of 50 degrees C from 500 to 650 degrees C for 1
   h. The resulting metakaolins were examined for structural changes after
   calcination and for their pozzolanic reactivity, influence on the
   hydration behavior of cement pastes, and impact on the compressive
   strength of mortar cubes. ZnO behaved as a delayed accelerator for
   cement paste. However, when ZnO was combined with highly amorphous
   metakaolin, chemical retardation was eliminated while acceleration was
   maintained. Such systems also had increased 28-day compressive
   strengths. ZnO additions did not affect the degree of dehydroxylation or
   the pozzolanic reactivity of the metakaolin. These results could
   facilitate the use of less pure calcined clays as SCM by providing a
   mechanism for improving reactivity and may also impact the ability to
   use zinc-contaminated materials in concrete. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Approximations for joint cumulative k-distribution for mixtures are
   efficient for full spectrum k-distribution (FSK) computations. These
   approximations provide reduction of the database that is necessary to
   perform FSK computation when compared to the direct approach, which uses
   cumulative k-distributions computed from the spectrum of the mixture,
   and also less computational expensive when compared to techniques in
   which RTE's are required to be solved for each component of the mixture.
   The aim of the present paper is to extend the approximations for joint
   cumulative k-distributions for non-LTE media. For doing that, a FSK to
   non-LIE media formulation well-suited to be applied along with
   approximations for joint cumulative k-distributions is presented. The
   application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by solving the
   radiation heat transfer in non-LIE high temperature plasmas composed of
   N, O, N-2, NO, N-2(+) and mixtures of these species. The two more
   efficient approximations, that is, the superposition and multiplication
   are employed and analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The current paper proposes the use of the multivariate skew-normal
   distribution function to accommodate non-normal mixing in
   cross-sectional and panel multinomial probit (MNP) models. The
   combination of skew-normal mixing and the MNP kernel lends itself nicely
   to estimation using Bhat's (2011) maximum approximate composite marginal
   likelihood (MACML) approach. Simulation results for the cross-sectional
   case show that our proposed approach does well in recovering the
   underlying parameters, and also highlights the pitfalls of ignoring
   non-normality of the continuous mixing distribution when such
   non-normality is present. At the same time, the proposed model obviates
   the need to assume a pre-specified parametric distribution for the
   mixing, and allows the estimation of a very flexible, but still
   parsimonious, mixing distribution form. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Ultrafiltration, nanofiltration membranes and feed spacers were
   hydrophilized with polydopamine and polydopamine-g-poly(ethylene glycol)
   surface coatings. The fouling propensity of modified and unmodified
   membranes was evaluated by short-term batch protein and bacterial
   adhesion tests. The fouling propensity of modified and unmodified
   membranes and spacers was evaluated by continuous biofouling experiments
   in a membrane fouling simulator. The goals of the study were: 1) to
   determine the effectiveness of polydopamine and
   polydopamine-g-poly(eakylene glycol) membrane coatings for biofouling
   control and 2) to compare techniques commonly used in assessment of
   membrane biofouling propensity with biofouling experiments under
   practical conditions. Short-term adhesion tests were carried out under
   static, no-flow conditions for 1 h using bovine serum albumin, a common
   model globular protein, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common model
   Gram-negative bacterium. Biofouling tests were performed in a membrane
   fouling simulator (MFS) for several days under flow conditions similar
   to those encountered in industrial modules with the autochthonous
   drinking water population and acetate dosage as organic substrate.
   Polydopamine- and polydopamine-g-poly(ethylene glycol)-modified
   membranes showed significantly reduced adhesion of bovine serum albumin
   and P. aeruginosa in the short-terra adhesion tests, but no reduction of
   biofouling was observed during longer biofouling experiments with
   modified membranes and spacers. These results demonstrate that
   short-term batch adhesion experiments using model proteins or bacteria
   under static conditions are not indicative of biofouling, while
   continuous biofouling experiments showed that membrane surface
   modification by polydopamine and polydopamine-g-poly(ethylene glycol) is
   not effective for biofouling control. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA) by a
   two-step polycondensation method with chemical imidization. This
   polyimide was used as the precursor to prepare thermally rearranged (TR)
   polymers. The rearrangement reaction was performed at temperatures from
   350 to 450 degrees C. Based on mass loss during the TR process, TR
   conversion levels as high as 76\% were observed. CO2 permeability
   increased from 12 Barrer in the precursor polyimide (HAB-6FDA) to 410
   Barrer in the TR polymer prepared at 450 degrees C, while pure gas
   CO2/CH4 selectivity decreased from 42 to 24. Both diffusivity and
   solubility increased following the rearrangement process, but the change
   in gas diffusivity was the largest contribution to the increase in
   permeability. From the polyimide to the sample heated at 450 for 30 min,
   CO2 diffusivity increased by approximately a factor of 20 while
   solubility increased by a factor of 1.7. Similar changes were observed
   for other gases. Fractional free volume increased from 15\% in the
   polyimide precursor to 20\% in the TR polymer rearranged at 450 degrees
   C. The HAB-6FDA TR polymers exhibited higher CO2 permeability than other
   classes of polymers with similar free volume, suggesting a free volume
   distribution in these TR polymers that favors high permeability. (C)

Abstract = {{A Variable Ratio Gearbox (VRG) can be used in the drivetrain of a small
   to medium-size wind turbine to improve aerodynamic efficiency.
   Currently, all commercially-available wind turbines operate using a
   fixed-gear ratio between the turbine rotor and electrical generator. A
   VRG allows wind turbines, with a constant-speed generator, to discretely
   vary rotor speed and to achieve greater aerodynamic efficiency. The
   authors' previous results demonstrate the viability of the VRG design.
   This research quantifies the gain in efficiency for a VRG-enabled wind
   turbine based on wind data from representing all seven wind
   classifications. A method is also presented to identify turbine sites
   that provide the VRG with the greatest opportunities to increase
   production. The overall findings suggest that the VRG can benefit all
   wind turbines, irrespective of wind class, with some wind profiles in
   the study experiencing gains greater than 10\%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of deepwater
   marine risers. Riser response measurements from model tests on a densely
   instrumented long, flexible riser in uniform and sheared currents offer
   an almost ideal setup for our work. Our objectives are two-fold: (i) we
   use the measured data to describe complexities inherent in riser motions
   accompanying VIV; and (ii) we discuss how such data sets (and even less
   spatially dense monitoring) can be used effectively in predicting
   fatigue damage rates, which are of critical interest for deepwater

Abstract = {{The SiOx-based resistive switching memory was realized by a simple
   TaN/SiO2/n(++) Si-substrate structure. Post-deposition annealing
   treatment not only reduced operational variation but also stabilized
   electrical reliability during repeated switching. The relationship
   between applied voltage polarity and reset switching parameters is
   investigated and may indicate that resistive switching occurs at the
   cathode side. Oxygen-vacancy clustering and asymmetrical
   thermal-dissipation of the electrodes are discussed as possible causes
   for the polarity dependence of reset switching parameters. Data
   retention in high- and low-resistance states was measured for over 10(4)
   s, indicating promising potential for future nonvolatile memory

Abstract = {{Many-body perturbation theory in the G(0)W(0) approximation is an
   increasingly popular tool for calculating electron removal energies and
   fundamental gaps for molecules and solids. However, the predictive power
   of G(0)W(0) is limited by its sensitivity to the density functional
   theory (DFT) starting point. We introduce a nonempirical scheme, which
   allows us to find a reliable DFT starting point for G(0)W(0)
   calculations. This is achieved by adapting the amount of Hartree-Fock
   exchange in a hybrid DFT functional. The G(0)W(0) spectra resulting from
   this starting point reliably predict experimental photoelectron spectra
   for a test set of 13 typical organic semiconductor molecules.}},

   dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Many biochemical networks have complex multidimensional dynamics and
   there is a long history of methods that have been used for
   dimensionality reduction for such reaction networks. Usually a
   deterministic mass action approach is used; however, in small volumes,
   there are significant fluctuations from the mean which the mass action
   approach cannot capture. In such cases stochastic simulation methods
   should be used. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of one such
   dimensionality reduction method, the quasi-steady state approximation
   (QSSA) {[}L. Menten and M. Michaelis, ``Die kinetik der
   invertinwirkung,{''} Biochem. Z 49, 333369 (1913)] for dimensionality
   reduction in case of stochastic dynamics. First, the applicability of
   QSSA approach is evaluated for a canonical system of enzyme reactions.
   Application of QSSA to such a reaction system in a deterministic setting
   leads to Michaelis-Menten reduced kinetics which can be used to derive
   the equilibrium concentrations of the reaction species. In the case of
   stochastic simulations, however, the steady state is characterized by
   fluctuations around the mean equilibrium concentration. Our analysis
   shows that a QSSA based approach for dimensionality reduction captures
   well the mean of the distribution as obtained from a full dimensional
   simulation but fails to accurately capture the distribution around that
   mean. Moreover, the QSSA approximation is not unique. We have then
   extended the analysis to a simple bistable biochemical network model
   proposed to account for the stability of synaptic efficacies; the
   substrate of learning and memory {[}J. E. Lisman, ``A mechanism of
   memory storage insensitive to molecular turnover: A bistable
   autophosphorylating kinase,{''} Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82,
   3055-3057 (1985)]. Our analysis shows that a QSSA based dimensionality
   reduction method results in errors as big as two orders of magnitude in
   predicting the residence times in the two stable states. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Initial events of helix breakage as a function of load are considered
   using molecular dynamics simulations and milestoning analysis. A helix
   length of similar to 100 amino acids is considered as a model for
   typical helices found in molecular machines and as a model that
   minimizes end effects for early events of unfolding. Transitions of
   individual amino acids (averaged over the helix's interior residues) are
   examined and its surrounding hydrogen bonds are considered. Dense
   kinetic networks are constructed that, with milestoning analysis,
   provide the Overall kinetics of early breakage events. Network analysis
   and Selection of MaxFlux pathways illustrate that load impacts unfolding
   mechanisms in addition to time scales.. At relatively high (100 pN) load
   levels, the principal intermediate is the, 3(10)-helix, while at
   relatively low (10 pN) levels the pi-helix is significantly populated,
   albeit not as an unfolding intermediate. Coarse variables are examined
   at different levels of resolution; the rate of unfolding illustrates
   remarkable stability, under changes in the coarsening. Consistent
   prediction of about similar to 5 for the time of a single amino acid
   unfolding event are obtained. Hydrogen bonds are much faster coarse
   variables (by about 2 orders of magnitude) compared to backbone
   torsional transition,:. which gates unfolding and thereby provides the
   appropriate coarse variable for the initiation of unfolding. Results
   provide an atomic description of ``catch-bond{''} behavior, based on
   alternative pathways, in which unfolding of a simple protein structural
   element occurs over longer timescales for intermediate (10 pN) loads
   than for zero (0 pN) or large (100 pN) loads.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate near-field fluorescence excitation and imaging with a
   quantum dot (QD) light emitting diode (QDLED) integrated at the tip of a
   scanning probe. The tip-embedded QDLED is employed in a near-field
   scanning optical microscopy setup to directly excite a secondary
   colloidal QD sample. Electrically pumped QDs enable multi-color,
   self-illuminating probes with no conventional optics needed for light
   coupling. Monolayer QDs stamped at the very tip of a micromachined
   silicon probe facilitates precise position control of the ultra-thin
   (10-15 nm) light source. Sensitivity of fluorescence intensity to the
   QDLED-QD sample distance was measured down to 50 nm order, demonstrating
   spatially resolved imaging. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We demonstrate efficient optical directional beaming using an array of
   sub-wavelength patterns on a metallic surface. Specifically, a
   sub-wavelength sized slit placed next to a periodic grating is designed
   and optimized to realize maximum coupling efficiency and directional
   radiation into a leaky-wave plasmonic mode. Collective scattering from
   the corrugations forming the grating is synthesized to radiate towards
   the desired direction, and efficient beaming is achieved through
   tailoring the design parameters with a simple analytical model. We also
   prove that directivity can be further enhanced by improving the
   slit-grating coupling efficiency through efficient plasmon generation,
   showing improved angular response in far-field radiation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A fundamental understanding of the interactions between coadsorbed water
   and hydrogen on metallic surfaces is critical to many chemical processes
   including catalysis and electrochemistry. Here, we report on the strong
   and intricate interactions between coadsorbed H/D and water on the
   close-packed (111) surface of gold. Deuterium isotopic labeling shows
   H/D exchange in H-D2O and D-H2O systems, indicating water dissociation
   and suggesting a nonrandom scrambling process by revealing the origin of
   hydrogen evolution (from surface H atoms or from water molecules) during
   annealing. In this reaction, the protonation of the H-bonding ice
   network (i.e., the formation of (H2O)(n)H+) is energetically favorable
   and is responsible for water dissociation. Density functional theory
   (DFT) modeling suggests that the thermodynamics and structure of the
   protonated clusters are predominant factors for yielding the traceable
   H-2 desorption features from the surface interaction with H atoms,
   providing insights into reaction mechanisms.}},

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the microscopic mechanism of cold and heat denaturation
   using a 3D lattice model of a hydrated protein in which water is
   represented explicitly. The water model, which incorporates directional
   bonding and tetrahedral geometry, captures many aspects of water
   thermodynamics and properly describes hydrophobic hydration around
   apolar solutes because the hydrogen bonding rules in the model were
   gleaned from off-lattice atomistic simulations of water around
   representative protein structures. By incorporating local chain
   stiffness in the protein model, a homopolymer can fold into a
   beta-hairpin. It is shown that the homopolymer can be folded by either
   attractive interactions between the monomers or as a direct consequence
   of the entropic cost of forming interfacial hydrogen bonds in the
   solvent. However, cold denaturation is not observed if the collapse
   transition is induced by intramolecular attractions. We further find
   that it is the changes in hydrophobic hydration with decreasing
   temperature that drive cold unfolding and that the overall process is
   enthalpically driven, whereas heat denaturation is entropically driven.}},

Abstract = {{The unique architecture of dendrimers has attracted interest in a wide
   variety of biomedical applications such as drug delivery. In order to
   gain insight into the solubilization of drugs inside dendrimer
   architectures, we have developed and numerically implemented a
   self-consistent field theory model for the equilibrium characteristics
   of charged dendrimer molecules in the presence of weakly acidic drug
   molecules. Using such a model, we examine the relative influence of
   excluded volume, electrostatic, and local enthalpic interactions upon
   the solubilization of drugs in dendrimers. When only excluded volume
   interactions are accounted, there is no driving force for drug
   solubilization inside the dendrimer, and hence depletion of the drug
   from the dendrimer molecule (relative to the bulk drug concentration) is
   observed. The inclusion of electrostatic interactions within the model
   results in solubilization of drugs within the dendrimer. The
   solubilization of the drugs is shown to increase with increasing drug
   charge density and increasing dendrimer generation number. We probe the
   effect of enthalpic interactions and demonstrate that the number of drug
   molecules encapsulated through enthalpic interaction is dependent upon
   the number of dendrimer monomers, the enthalpic interaction parameters
   between the dendrimer and drug (chi(PD)), and the drug and solvent
   (chi(DS)). We also analyze the combined effects of the preceding
   interactions to identify the synergism in their influence and delineate
   the relative importance of different parameters such as pOH, size of the
   drugs, and the Bjerrum length of the solution in influencing the
   encapsulation of drugs by dendrimer molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid and precise screening of small genetic variations, such as
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), among an individual's genome is
   still an unmet challenge at point-of-care settings. One Crucial step
   toward this goal is the development of discrimination probes that
   require no enzymatic reaction and are easy to use. Here we report a new
   type of fluorescent molecular probe, termed a chameleon NanoCluster
   Beacon (cNCB), that lights up into different colors upon binding SNP
   targets. NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are collections of a small number of
   Ag atoms templated on single-stranded DNA that fluoresce strongly when
   placed in proximity to particular DNA sequences, termed enhancers. Here
   we show the fluorescence emission color of a NCB can change
   substantially (a shift of 60-70 nm in the emission maximum) depending
   upon the alignment between the silver nanocluster and the DNA enhancer
   sequence. Chameleon NCBs exploit this color shift to directly detect
   SNPs, based on the fact that different SNPs produce a different
   alignment between the Ag nanocluster and the enhancer. This SNP
   detection method has been validated on all single-nucleotide
   substitution scenarios in three synthetic DNA targets, in six
   disease-related SNP targets, and in two clinical samples taken from
   patients with ovarian serous borderline tumors. Samples with
   single-nucleotide variations can be easily identified by the naked eye
   under UV excitation, making this method a reliable and low-cost assay
   with a simple readout format.}},

Abstract = {{We adapt a general-purpose optimization-based parameter estimation
   technique previously described in the literature {[}1] to evaluate the
   suitability of a number of common kinetic models for the representation
   of key performance characteristics (conversion and selectivity) of
   catalysts used for the preferential oxidation of CO in the presence of
   H-2. We find that, for process engineering applications, there is no
   clear practical advantage to using mechanistically based kinetic models
   (e.g. Langmuir-Hinshelwood) unless the precise chemical mechanism is
   known. Empirical rate models are found generally to provide equivalent
   or better simulations of key performance variables for a diverse group
   of catalyst formulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
   water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction is relevant within PROX reaction systems
   under conditons containing high fractions of CO2 and H-2, confirming the
   expectations of Choi and Stenger (2004) {[}2]. Finally, we attempt to
   identify any emergent trends in kinetic parameters among catalysts
   sharing similar active metal or metal oxide components. Unfortunately,
   apart from confirming that the activation barrier for CO oxidation is
   generally less than the barrier for H-2 oxidation (an expected
   relationship for PROX catalysts), no such trends are found. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) is a promising material for
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation with a narrow band gap (2.1
   eV) that can effectively utilize visible light in the solar spectrum.
   Ta3N5 nanotube (NT) arrays were synthesized on a Ta foil by
   electrochemical anodization followed by an ammonia treatment at 800
   degrees C. The photocurrent of nanostructured Ta3N5 was over 3 times
   higher than that of a dense regular Ta3N5 film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous
   solution at pH 11. Several electrocatalysts (IrO2 nanoparticles (NPs),
   Co3O4 NPs, cobalt phosphate, and Pt NPs) were used to modify Ta3N5 NTs
   for PEC water oxidation. The photocurrent of Ta3N5 NTs modified with
   IrO2 and Co3O4 was ca. four times higher than that of unmodified NTs.
   Cobalt phosphate also showed a positive improvement for PEC water
   oxidation on Ta3N5 NTs, whereas Pt was ineffective. Scanning
   electrochemical microscopy was used to measure the faradaic efficiency
   of the Ta3N5 photoanodes for water oxidation, which can reach as high as
   88\% for a Co3O4-Ta3N5 NTs photoanode, but is less than 15\% at best,
   for Ta3N5 without the electrocatalyst. The results indicate that cobalt
   oxide and cobalt phosphate are promising candidates as electrocatalysts
   on Ta3N5 for water oxidation because Co is an earth-abundant material.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study investigated the impact on recurrences of 2
   different substrate approaches for the treatment of these arrhythmias.
   Background Catheter ablation of electrical storms (ES) for ventricular
   arrhythmias (VAs) has shown moderate long-term efficacy in patients with
   ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   Methods Ninety-two consecutive patients (81\% male, age 62 +/- 13 years)
   with ischemic cardiomyopathy and ES underwent catheter ablation.
   Patients were treated either by confining the radiofrequency lesions to
   the endocardial surface with limited substrate ablation (Group 1, n =
   49) or underwent endocardial and epicardial ablation of abnormal
   potentials within the scar (homogenization of the scar, Group 2, n =
   43). Epicardial access was obtained in all Group 2 patients, whereas
   epicardial ablation was performed in 33\% (14) of these patients.
   Results Mean ejection fraction was 27 +/- 5. During a mean follow-up of
   25 +/- 10 months, the VAs recurrence rate of any ventricular tachycardia
   (VTs) was 47\% (23 of 49 patients) in Group 1 and 19\% (8 of 43
   patients) in Group 2 (log-rank p = 0.006). One patient in Group 1 and 1
   patient in Group 2 died at follow-up for noncardiac reasons.
   Conclusions Our study demonstrates that ablation using endo-epicardial
   homogenization of the scar significantly increases freedom from VAs in
   ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012;60:132-41) (C)

   sequencing systems}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Next-generation sequencing systems are capable of rapid and
   cost-effective DNA sequencing, thus enabling routine sequencing tasks
   and taking us one step closer to personalized medicine. Accuracy and
   lengths of their reads, however, are yet to surpass those provided by
   the conventional Sanger sequencing method. This motivates the search for
   computationally efficient algorithms capable of reliable and accurate
   detection of the order of nucleotides in short DNA fragments from the
   acquired data.
   Results: In this paper, we consider Illumina's sequencing-by-synthesis
   platform which relies on reversible terminator chemistry and describe
   the acquired signal by reformulating its mathematical model as a Hidden
   Markov Model. Relying on this model and sequential Monte Carlo methods,
   we develop a parameter estimation and base calling scheme called
   ParticleCall. ParticleCall is tested on a data set obtained by
   sequencing phiX174 bacteriophage using Illumina's Genome Analyzer II.
   The results show that the developed base calling scheme is significantly
   more computationally efficient than the best performing unsupervised
   method currently available, while achieving the same accuracy.
   Conclusions: The proposed ParticleCall provides more accurate calls than
   the Illumina's base calling algorithm, Bustard. At the same time,
   ParticleCall is significantly more computationally efficient than other
   recent schemes with similar performance, rendering it more feasible for
   high-throughput sequencing data analysis. Improvement of base calling
   accuracy will have immediate beneficial effects on the performance of
   downstream applications such as SNP and genotype calling.

Abstract = {{Thermotropic main-chain liquid crystalline polymers typically have very
   low melt viscosity with strong temperature dependence compared to other
   common thermoplastics. While this is beneficial in some processing
   applications, such as injection molding, it presents challenges for
   others, such as coextrusion. In this study, the theological properties
   of a thermotropic main-chain liquid crystalline polymer (Vectra A950)
   were enhanced by melt-state reactive processing with triphenyl phosphite
   (TPP), which can react with up to three polymer chain-ends through their
   chain-end functionalities. The influence of processing time and TPP
   content on the shear viscosity and other important material properties
   were investigated. Optimal conditions, which increased the shear
   viscosity by nearly a factor of 20 over the neat polymer, were found to
   be 4 wt\% TPP and 30 min of reaction time at 290 degrees C. Further
   results from differential scanning calorimetry, wide-angle X-ray
   diffraction and polarized optical microscopy confirmed that coupling
   with TPP did not affect the microstructure, melting/crystallization
   behavior or liquid crystallinity. The stability of TPP-modified samples
   was also studied at 80 degrees C in air and following melt reprocessing
   at 290-300 degrees C under N-2 or air. Samples were stable (as measured
   by shear viscosity) for more than one month at 80 degrees C in air or
   when reprocessed in N-2 at 290 degrees C for up to 10 min. However, when
   reprocessed at 300 degrees C in air, the viscosity enhancement was
   partially reversed due to scission of P-O bonds that were formed during
   the initial reaction between the polymer chain-ends and TPP. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents a formalized vulnerability representation schema
   that targets supporting vulnerability assessment in a facility during an
   emergency triggered by a failure in a building system by identifying
   which critical assets might be affected by the current emergency. The
   representation schema captures to which threats specific content are
   vulnerable. Specifically, it enables the representation of threats and
   how they can be traced spatially. Moreover, it provides a way to
   describe content by its type, its exchange and use values as a way to
   identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, and to represent different
   types of content collections. Such a representation schema is needed for
   supporting automated vulnerability assessment in building emergencies.
   The formalized representation schema was tested for coverage in
   synthetic tests using OmniClass for content and the Emergency Response
   Guidebook for threats. For content, 84\% of 245 content types in
   OmniClass were successfully represented using the schema. These 245
   content types represent the content commonly included in facility asset
   management databases. For threats, 79\% of threats were successfully
   represented using the schema. The schema was also tested for
   extensibility in user tests, in which 99\% of content types and 83\% of
   threats cited by users were successfully represented using the schema.

Title = {{Buckling Behavior of Steel Bridge I-Girders Braced by Permanent Metal
   Deck Forms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{624-633}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Permanent metal deck forms (PMDFs) are often used in the bridge industry
   to support wet concrete and other loads during construction. Although
   metal formwork in the building industry is routinely relied on for
   stability bracing, the forms are not permitted for bracing in the bridge
   industry, despite the large in-plane stiffness. The forms in bridge
   applications are typically supported on cold-formed angles, which allow
   the contractor to adjust the form elevation to account for changes in
   flange thickness and differential camber between adjacent girders.
   Although the support angles are beneficial toward the constructability
   of the bridge, they lead to eccentric connections that substantially
   reduce the in-plane stiffness of the PMDF systems, which is one of the
   reasons the forms are not relied on for bracing in bridge applications.
   This paper documents the results of an investigation focused on
   improving the bracing potential of bridge deck forms. Modifications to
   the connection details were developed to improve the stiffness and
   strength of the forming system. Research included buckling tests on a
   15-m (50-ft) long, twin-girder system with PMDFs for bracing. In
   addition, twin-girder tests were also used to validate computer models
   of the bracing systems that were used for parametric finite-element
   analytical studies. The buckling test results demonstrated that modified
   connection details make PMDF systems a viable bracing alternative in
   steel bridges, which can significantly reduce the number of cross-frames
   or diaphragms required for stability bracing of steel bridge I-girders
   during construction. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000276. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Performance measurement is essential to controlling and improving
   capital projects. Increasingly, industry sectors demand an
   industry-specific performance measurement system because their unique
   processes can result in significant differences in performance outcomes.
   This paper presents the development of a performance dashboard for a
   pharmaceutical project benchmarking program. The proposed approach
   adopts a relative comparison method and uses weighted key performance
   indicators (KPIs) to compare project performance. The dashboard
   generates an overall performance score both at the project level and at
   the company level, as shown in tabular and graphical formats. The
   dashboard provides flexibility for comparing the performance of projects
   even when the project types or KPIs are different. Although the study
   focuses on a performance dashboard for pharmaceutical industry projects,
   the dashboard development process described in this paper can be applied
   to other industry projects. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000503. (C)

Abstract = {{To evaluate sediment removal in dry detention basins, one of the most
   frequently used Best Management Practices (BMPs), a particle pathline
   model using plug flow assumption was proposed in a previous study. The
   model requires numerical integration, thus it may not be convenient for
   quick evaluation and design of detention basins. To overcome the
   difficulty a simpler continuous stirring tank reactor (CSTR) model is
   proposed and used to compare outflow Suspended Sediment Concentrations
   (SSCs) from different size storms using a nondimensionalized time scale.
   The CSTR model satisfactorily predicts sediment removal and outflow SSC
   measured using a physical model. The paper presents the time
   nondimensionalization and CSTR model application processes and discusses
   the critical characteristics of the proposed models. DOI:

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{With the emerging nationwide availability of battery electric vehicles
   (BEVs) at prices attainable for many consumers, electric utilities,
   system operators and researchers have been investigating the impact of
   this new source of energy demand. The presence of BEVs on the electric
   grid might offer benefits equivalent to dedicated utility-scale energy
   storage systems by leveraging vehicles' grid-connected energy storage
   through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled infrastructure. It is, however,
   unclear whether BEVs will be available to provide needed grid services
   when those services are in highest demand. In this work, a set of GPS
   vehicle travel data from the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) is
   analyzed to assess temporal patterns in vehicle use. These results show
   that vehicle use does not vary significantly across months, but differs
   noticeably between weekdays and weekends, such that averaging the data
   together could lead to erroneous V2G modeling results. Combination of
   these trends with wind generation and electricity demand data from the
   Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) indicates that BEV
   availability does not align well with electricity demand and wind
   generation during the summer months, limiting the quantity of ancillary
   services that could be provided with V2G. Vehicle availability aligns
   best between the hours of 9 pm and 8 am during cooler months of the
   year, when electricity demand is bimodal and brackets the hours of
   highest vehicle use.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a sector-based inversion method to improve the
   petrophysical interpretation of logging-while-drilling density
   measurements acquired in high-angle and horizontal wells. The central
   objective is to reduce shoulder-bed effects on the measurements. This
   approach is possible because of a recently developed technique to
   accurately and efficiently simulate borehole density measurements. The
   inversion-based interpretation method consists of first detecting bed
   boundaries from short-spacing detector or bottom-quadrant compensated
   density by calculating their variance, representative of the measurement
   inflection point, within a sliding window. Subsequently, a correlation
   algorithm calculates dip and azimuth from the density image. Depth
   shifts that vary azimuthally and depend on relative dip angle, together
   with the effective penetration length of each sensor, refine previously
   selected bed boundaries. Next, the inversion method combines
   sector-based density measurements acquired at all measurement points
   along the well trajectory to estimate layer-by-layer densities. In the
   presence of standoff, the method excludes upper sectors most affected by
   standoff to reduce inaccuracies due to borehole mud. To verify the
   reliability and applicability of the inversion method, we first use
   forward simulations to generate synthetic density images for a model
   constructed from field data. Results indicate that inversion improves
   the interpretation of azimuthal density data as it consistently reduces
   shoulder-bed effects. Inversion results obtained from field measurements
   are appraised by quantifying the corresponding integrated porosity-meter
   yielded by inversion methods in comparison to standard techniques that
   use simple cutoffs on field-processed compensated density. Integrated
   porosity-meter of inverted synthetic density measurements increases by
   4.6\% with respect to noninverted field measurements. Also, integrated
   porosity-meter obtained from inversion results that include only bottom
   sectors improved by 65.4\% with respect to that calculated with
   field-compensated, bottom-quadrant density measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an opportunistic interference mitigation (OIM) protocol,
   where a user scheduling strategy is utilized in K-cell uplink networks
   with time-invariant channel coefficients and base stations (BSs) having
   M antennas. Each BS opportunistically selects a set of users who
   generate the minimum interference to the other BSs. Two OIM protocols
   are shown according to the number of simultaneously transmitting users
   per cell, S: opportunistic interference nulling (OIN) and opportunistic
   interference alignment (OIA). Then, their performance is analyzed in
   terms of degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). As our main result, it is shown that
   KM DoFs are achievable under the OIN protocol with M selected users per
   cell, if the total number of users in a cell, N, scales at least as
   SNR(K-1)M. Similarly, it turns out that the OIA scheme with S(< M)
   selected users achieves KS DoFs, if N scales faster than SNR(K-1)S.
   These results indicate that there exists a trade-off between the
   achievable DoFs and the minimum required N. By deriving the
   corresponding upper bound on the DoFs, it is shown that the OIN scheme
   is DoF-optimal. Finally, numerical evaluation, a two-step scheduling
   method, and the extension to multi-carrier scenarios are shown.}},

Abstract = {{Interference management techniques are critical to the performance of
   heterogeneous cellular networks, which will have dense and overlapping
   coverage areas, and experience high levels of interference. Fractional
   frequency reuse (FFR) is an attractive interference management technique
   due to its low complexity and overhead, and significant coverage
   improvement for low-percentile (cell-edge) users. Instead of relying on
   system simulations based on deterministic access point locations, this
   paper instead proposes an analytical model for evaluating Strict FFR and
   Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) deployments based on the spatial Poisson
   point process. Our results both capture the non-uniformity of
   heterogeneous deployments and produce tractable expressions which can be
   used for system design with Strict FFR and SFR. We observe that the use
   of Strict FFR bands reserved for the users of each tier with the lowest
   average SINR provides the highest gains in terms of coverage and rate,
   while the use of SFR allows for more efficient use of shared spectrum
   between the tiers, while still mitigating much of the interference.
   Additionally, in the context of multi-tier networks with closed access
   in some tiers, the proposed framework shows the impact of cross-tier
   interference on closed access FFR, and informs the selection of key FFR
   parameters in open access.}},

Abstract = {{Acceptance of imprint lithography for manufacturing will require
   demonstration that it can attain defect levels commensurate with the
   defect specifications of high-end memory devices. Defects occurring
   during imprinting can generally be broken into two categories; random
   defects and repeating defects. Examples of random defects include fluid
   phase imprint defects, such as bubbles, and solid phase imprint defects,
   such as line collapse. Examples of repeater defects include mask
   fabrication defects and particle induced defects. Previous studies
   indicated that soft particles cause nonrepeating defects. Hard
   particles, on the other hand, can cause either permanent resist plugging
   or mask damage. In a previous study, two specific defect types were
   examined; random nonfill defects occurring during the resist filling
   process and repeater defects caused by interactions with particles on
   the substrate. We attempted to identify the different types of imprint
   defect types using a mask with line/space patterns at dimensions as
   small as 26 nm. An Imprio 500 twenty-wafer per hour development tool was
   used to study the various defect types. The imprint defect density was
   reduced nearly four orders of magnitude, down to similar to 4/cm(2) in a
   period of two years following the availability of low defect imprint
   masks at 26-nm half-pitch. This reduction was achieved by identifying
   the root cause of various defects and then taking the appropriate
   corrective action. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Title = {{Control of unsteadiness of a shock wave/turbulent boundary layer
   interaction by using a pulsed-plasma-jet actuator}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A pulsed-plasma jet actuator is used to control the unsteady motion of
   the separation shock of a shock wave/boundary layer interaction formed
   by a compression ramp in a Mach 3 flow. The actuator is based on a
   plasma-generated synthetic jet and is configured as an array of three
   jets that can be injected normal to the cross-flow, pitched, or pitched
   and skewed. The typical peak jet exit velocity of the actuators is about
   300 m/s and the pulsing frequencies are a few kilohertz. A study of the
   interaction between the pulsed-plasma jets and the shock/boundary layer
   interaction was performed in a time-resolved manner using 10 kHz
   schlieren imaging. When the actuator, pulsed at St(L) approximate to
   0.04 (f = 2 kHz), was injected into the upstream boundary layer, the
   separation shock responded to the plasma jet by executing a rapid
   upstream motion followed by a gradual downstream recovery motion.
   Schlieren movies of the interaction showed that the separation shock
   unsteadiness was locked to the pulsing frequency of the actuator, with
   amplitude of about one boundary layer thickness. Wall-pressure
   measurements made under the intermittent region showed about a 30\%
   decrease in the overall magnitude of the pressure fluctuations in the
   low-frequency band associated with unsteady large-scale motion of the
   separated flow. Furthermore, by increasing the pulsing frequency to 3.3
   kHz, the amplitude of the separation shock oscillation was reduced to
   less than half the boundary layer thickness. Investigation into the
   effect of the actuator location on the shock wave/boundary layer
   interaction (SWBLI) showed qualitatively and quantitatively that the
   actuator placed upstream of the separation shock caused significant
   modification to the SWBLI unsteadiness, whereas injection from inside
   the separation bubble did not cause a noticeable effect. (C) 2012

Title = {{Accounting for uncertainty in the analysis of overlap layer mean
   velocity models}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{When assessing the veracity of mathematical models, it is important to
   consider the uncertainties in the data used for the assessment. In this
   paper, we study the impact of data uncertainties on the analysis of
   overlap layer models for the mean velocity in wall-bounded turbulent
   flows. Specifically, the tools of Bayesian statistics are used to
   calibrate and compare six competing models of the mean velocity profile,
   including multiple logarithmic and power law forms, using velocity
   profile measurements from a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary
   layer and fully developed turbulent pipe flow. The calibration problem
   is formulated as a Bayesian update of the joint probability density
   function for the calibration parameters, which are treated as random
   variables to characterize incomplete knowledge about their values. This
   probabilistic formulation provides a natural treatment of uncertainty
   and gives insight into the quality of the fit, features that are not
   easily obtained in deterministic calibration procedures. The model
   comparison also relies on a Bayesian update. In particular, the relative
   probabilities of the competing models are updated using the calibration
   data. The resulting posterior probabilities quantify the relative
   plausibility of the competing models given the data. For the boundary
   layer, results are shown for five subsets of the turbulent boundary
   layer data due to Osterlund, including different Reynolds number and
   wall distance ranges, and multiple assumptions regarding the magnitude
   of the uncertainty in the velocity measurements. For most choices,
   multiple models have relatively high posterior probability, indicating
   that it is difficult to distinguish between the models. For the most
   inclusive data sets-i.e., the largest ranges of Reynolds number and wall
   distance-the first-order logarithmic law due to Buschmann and Gad-el-Hak
   is significantly more probable, given the data, than the other models
   evaluated. For the pipe flow, data from the Princeton Superpipe is
   analyzed for the region where McKeon find a logarithmic layer (600 <=
   y(+) <= 0.12 delta(+)). As in the boundary layer case, the first-order
   logarithmic law by Buschmann and Gad-el-Hak is most probable. However,
   the parameter values required to fit the data are different from those
   necessary for the boundary layer. Thus, the present analysis confirms
   the differences between the boundary layer and pipe flow results
   observed elsewhere in the literature, casting serious doubt on the
   universality of overlap layer model parameters. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{A general approach for achieving consistency in the transport properties
   between direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and Navier-Stokes (CFD)
   solvers is presented for five-species air. Coefficients of species
   diffusion, viscosity, and thermal conductivities are considered. The
   transport coefficients that are modeled in CFD solvers are often
   obtained by expressions involving sets of collision integrals, which are
   obtained from more realistic intermolecular potentials (i.e., ab initio
   calculations). In this work, the self-consistent effective binary
   diffusion and Gupta et al.-Yos tranport models are considered. The DSMC
   transport coefficients are approximated from Chapman-Enskog theory in
   which the collision integrals are computed using either the variable
   hard sphere (VHS) and variable soft sphere (VSS) (phenomenological)
   collision cross section models. The VHS and VSS parameters are then used
   to adjust the DSMC transport coefficients in order to achieve a best-fit
   to the coefficients computed from more realistic intermolecular
   potentials over a range of temperatures. The best-fit collision model
   parameters are determined for both collision-averaged and
   collision-specific pairing approaches using the Nelder-Mead simplex
   algorithm. A consistent treatment of the diffusion, viscosity, and
   thermal conductivities is presented, and recommended sets of best-fit
   VHS and VSS collision model parameters are provided for a five-species

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. We identified candidate optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   markers for early glaucoma diagnosis. Time variation of retinal nerve
   fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, phase retardation, birefringence, and
   reflectance using polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography
   (PS-OCT) were measured in three non-human primates with induced glaucoma
   in one eye. We characterized time variation of RNFL thickness, phase
   retardation, birefringence, and reflectance with elevated intraocular
   pressure (IOP).
   METHODS. One eye of each of three non-human primates was laser treated
   to increase IOP. Each primate was followed for a 30-week period. PS-OCT
   measurements were recorded at weekly intervals. Reflectance index (RI)
   is introduced to characterize RNFL reflectance. Associations between
   elevated IOP and RNFL thickness, phase retardation, birefringence, and
   reflectance were characterized in seven regions (entire retina, inner
   and outer rings, and nasal, temporal, superior and inferior quadrants)
   by linear and non-linear mixed-effects models.
   RESULTS. Elevated IOP was achieved in three non-human primate eyes with
   an average increase of 13 mm Hg over the study period. Elevated IOP was
   associated with decreased RNFL thickness in the nasal region (P =
   0.0002), decreased RNFL phase retardation in the superior (P = 0.046)
   and inferior (P = 0.021) regions, decreased RNFL birefringence in the
   nasal (P = 0.002) and inferior (P = 0.029) regions, and loss of RNFL
   reflectance in the outer rings (P = 0.018). When averaged over the
   entire retinal area, only RNFL reflectance showed a significant decrease
   (P = 0.028).
   CONCLUSIONS. Of the measured parameters, decreased RNFL reflectance was
   the most robust correlate with glaucomatous damage. Candidate cellular
   mechanisms are considered for decreased RNFL reflectance, including
   mitochondrial dysfunction and retinal ganglion cell apoptosis. (Invest

Abstract = {{We investigate state observer and feedback control design for systems
   with state-and time-dependent control or measurement gains. In this
   framework, we look at reversible transducers that are continually
   switched between the actuation and sensing modes at some prespecified
   schedule. Design and analysis of stable state-observers and feedback
   controllers for these classes of switched/hybrid systems are
   significantly complicated by the fact that, at any given instant of
   time, the overall system loses either controllability (during the
   sensing phase) or observability (during the actuation phase). In this
   work, we consider systems with scalar time-varying measurement gains and
   provide a novel observer construction that guarantees exponential
   reconstruction of state estimates to their true values. We go a step
   further to derive an exponentially stabilizing controller design that
   uses the state estimates resulting from our observer. This amounts to
   the establishment of a rather remarkable separation property of the
   control design. These developments hinge on a rather mild technical
   assumption, which can be interpreted for the reversible transducer
   problem as a persistent dwell time for both the sensing and actuation
   modes. An important feature here is that the convergence rate can be
   specified to any arbitrary value. Our theoretical results are validated
   through numerical simulations of challenging test-cases that include
   open-loop unstable systems. The paper also illustrates potential for
   nonlinear extensions of the observer based control design by considering
   an interesting special case. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4005510]}},

Abstract = {{Epitaxial anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) films have been grown by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) on Si(001) substrates using a strontium
   titanate (STO) buffer layer without any amorphous SiOx layer at the
   STO-Si interface. Four unit cells of STO grown by molecular beam epitaxy
   (MBE) serve as the surface template for ALD growth. To preserve the
   quality of the MBE-grown STO, the samples were transferred in situ from
   the MBE chamber to the ALD chamber. The growth of TiO2 was achieved
   using titanium isopropoxide and water as the coreactants at a substrate
   temperature of 250 degrees C. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   analysis revealed that the ALD process did not induce Si-O bonding at
   the STO-Si interface. Slight improvement in crystallinity of the TiO2
   film was achieved through in situ annealing under vacuum (10(-9) Torr)
   at 450-600 degrees C. However, the amount of Si-O bonding increased
   following annealing at temperatures greater than 250 degrees C. X-ray
   diffraction revealed that TiO2 films annealed at a temperature of 250
   degrees C in vacuum (10(-9) Torr) for 1 h were the anatase phase and
   well crystallized. The results indicate that careful consideration of
   growth temperature and annealing conditions may allow epitaxial oxide
   films to be grown by ALD on STO-buffered Si(001) substrates without
   formation of an amorphous SiOx layer. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the effect of graphene surface chemistry on the
   electrochemical performance of graphene/polyaniline composites as
   supercapacitor electrodes, graphene oxide (G-O), chemically reduced G-O
   (RG-O), nitrogen-doped RG-O (N-RG-O), and amine-modified RG-O (NH2-RG-O)
   were selected as carriers and loaded with about 9 wt \% of polyaniline
   (PANi). The surface chemistry of these materials was analyzed by FTIR,
   NEXAFS, and XPS, and the type of surface chemistry was found to be
   important for growth of PANi that influences the magnitude of increase
   of specific capacitance. The NH2-RG-O/PANi composite exhibited the
   largest increase in capacitance with a value as high as 500 F g(-1) and
   good cyclability with no loss of capacitance over 680 cycles, much
   better than that of RG-O/PANi, N-RG-O/PANi, and G-O/PANi when measured
   in a three-electrode system. A NH2-RG-O/PANWN-RG-O supercapacitor cell
   has a capacitance of 79 F g(-1), and the corresponding specific
   capacitance for NH2-RG-O/PANi is 395 F g(-1). This research highlights
   the importance of introducing -NH2 to RG-O to achieve highly stable
   cycling performance and high capacitance values.}},

   h-BN with a controlled number of layers defined by the growth
   conditions, temperature, time, and gas partial pressure. Furthermore,
   few-layer h-BN was also grown by a sequential growth method, and
   insights into the growth mechanism are described, thus forming the basis
   of future growth of h-BN by atomic layer epitaxy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the optimization and control of thermal energy
   storage systems. Emphasis is given to thermal storage applied to
   combined heat and power systems, building systems, and solar thermal

   and control of thermal storage systems improves plant performance and
   improves the management of transient energy loads in a variety of
   applications. In order to maximize the benefits of thermal storage, it
   is necessary to include advanced multi-variate constrained controls,
   such as model predictive control. Thermal storage also increases system
   flexibility, allowing the incorporation of intermittent renewable energy
   sources. The flexibility of thermal storage will play an increasingly
   important role as utilities implement smart grid technology with
   time-of-use electricity pricing. Lastly, thermal energy storage improves
   system economics by reducing required equipment sizes, improving

Abstract = {{Efficient spatial and temporal resolution of simulated inflow wind
   fields is important in order to represent wind turbine dynamics and
   derive load statistics for design. Using Fourier-based stochastic
   simulation of inflow turbulence, we first investigate loads for a
   utility-scale turbine in the neutral atmospheric boundary layer. Load
   statistics, spectra, and wavelet analysis representations for different
   space and time resolutions are compared. Next, large-eddy simulation
   (LES) is employed with space-time resolutions, justified on the basis of
   the earlier stochastic simulations, to again derive turbine loads.
   Extreme and fatigue loads from the two approaches used in inflow field
   generation are compared. On the basis of simulation studies carried out
   for three different wind speeds in the turbine's operating range, it is
   shown that inflow turbulence described using 10-meter spatial resolution
   and 1 Hz temporal resolution is adequate for assessing turbine loads.
   Such studies on the investigation of adequate filtering or resolution of
   inflow wind fields help to establish efficient strategies for LES and
   other physical or stochastic simulation needed in turbine loads studies.}},

   biodiesel production due to their rapid growth, high content of
   triacylglycerols, and ability to be grown on non-arable land.
   Unfortunately, obtaining oil from algae is currently cost prohibitive in
   part due to the need to pump and process large volumes of dilute algal
   suspensions. In an effort to circumvent this problem, we have explored
   the use of anion exchange resins for simplifying the processing of algae
   to biofuel. Anion exchange resins can bind and accumulate the algal
   cells out of suspension to form a dewatered concentrate. Treatment of
   the resin-bound algae with sulfuric acid/methanol elutes the algae and
   regenerates the resin while converting algal lipids to biodiesel.
   Hydrophobic polymers can remove biodiesel from the sulfuric
   acid/methanol, allowing the transesterification reagent to be reused. We
   show that in situ transesterification of algal lipids can efficiently
   convert algal lipids to fatty acid methyl esters while allowing the
   resin and transesterification reagent to be recycled numerous times
   without loss of effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The electromagnetic heating of heavy crude oil in cylindrical pipes
   represents a novel technique to reduce fluid viscosity and diminish the
   cost required for its transportation. In this study, the oil viscous
   fluid momentum and energy balances, which include the effects of
   electromagnetic heating, variable viscosity, and fluid dielectric
   properties, are solved in cylindrical coordinates. The electromagnetic
   energy absorbed by oil is converted into sensible heat, which could
   significantly reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil fluids. This drop
   in fluid viscosity diminishes flow pressure losses in pipelines, which
   reduces the number and size of pumping stations between oil producers
   and consumers. Different pipe materials are considered here to determine
   the effect of their dielectric properties in the fluid flow. Simulation
   results show that pipe materials with large electromagnetic absorption
   tend to attenuate the pipe interior electromagnetic field, which reduces
   the direct warming of the fluid. This significant reduction in the
   direct fluid heating suggests that pipes made by transparent
   electromagnetic materials are preferred for this type of application. A
   fixed cost analysis of using electromagnetic heaters was made to
   maximize the distance between pump stations in a long pipeline stretch.
   The simulation results demonstrate that electromagnetic heaters increase
   the distance between pump stations by 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{With the lunar ascent in mind, the minimum time trajectory of a constant
   thrust rocket transferring from one point to another in the neighborhood
   of a spherical body is solved in the local vertical local horizontal
   reference frame. It is also assumed that the transfer is quasiplanar and
   that the thrust pitch and yaw angles are small. The solution of the
   resulting two-point boundary value problem involves modified thrust
   integrals and requires three quadratures and one iteration. A result of
   this solution is that a variable multiplier can be assumed constant,
   leading to an analytical solution (without quadrature and without
   iteration) in terms of the well known thrust integrals. These are new
   solutions for the constant thrust, minimum time transfer problem over a
   spherical moon. Both solutions are tested in a sample and hold guidance
   scheme. First, the out-of-plane initial conditions are set to zero. The
   planar results show that both solutions satisfy the final conditions,
   consume the same mass, and use approximately the same thrust pitch angle
   history. Second, to test out-of-plane performance, the out-of-plane
   initial conditions are made nonzero. The results are similar. Because
   the second solution is analytical, it merits further consideration as an
   onboard guidance algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The isolator is an important flow section in a dual-mode scramjet engine
   that provides stable compressed flow to the combustor. However, if the
   combustor-induced backpressure exceeds a limiting value, the compression
   structure inside the isolator could be disgorged, leading to inlet
   unstart. Numerical tools that can predict unstart would be valuable in
   the design of robust scramjet engines. Here, the predictive capability
   of the large-eddy-simulation methodology is assessed by validating
   against experimental studies of isolator unstart. A conservative
   finite-difference-based large-eddy-simulation approach incorporating
   immersed-boundary methodology has been developed for this purpose. Using
   a variety of numerical schemes, subfilter models, and computational
   grids, it is demonstrated that large-eddy simulation is able to predict
   fully started flow quite accurately. Further simulations of unstart
   configurations indicate that large-eddy simulation is able to capture
   the large-scale features of the unstart process remarkably well,
   exhibiting unsteady flow structures nearly identical to the experiment.
   Quantitatively, large-eddy simulation overpredicts boundary-layer
   separation that leads to faster shock propagation as compared to
   experiments.}},

Title = {{A parametric study of Io's thermophysical surface properties and

Abstract = {{Io's sublimation atmosphere is inextricably linked to the SO2 surface
   frost temperature distribution which is poorly constrained by
   observations. We constrain Io's surface thermal distribution by a
   parametric study of its thermophysical properties in an attempt to
   better model the morphology of Io's sublimation atmosphere. Io's surface
   thermal distribution is represented by three thermal units: sulfur
   dioxide (SO2) frosts/ices, non-frosts (probably sulfur allotropes and/or
   pyroclastic dusts), and hot spots. The hot spots included in our thermal
   model are static high temperature surfaces with areas and temperatures
   based on Keck infrared observations. Elsewhere, over frosts and
   non-frosts, our thermal model solves the one-dimensional heat conduction
   equation in depth into Io's surface and includes the effects of eclipse
   by Jupiter, radiation from Jupiter, and latent heat of sublimation and
   condensation. The best fit parameters for the SO2 frost and non-frost
   units are found by using a least-squares method and fitting to
   observations of the Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging
   Spectrograph (HST STIS) mid- to near-UV reflectance spectra and Galileo
   PPR brightness temperature. The thermophysical parameters are the frost
   Bond albedo, alpha(F), and thermal inertia, Gamma(F), as well as the
   non-frost surface Bond albedo, alpha(NF), and thermal inertia,
   Gamma(NF). The best fit parameters are found to be alpha(F) approximate
   to 0.55 +/- 0.02 and Gamma(F) approximate to 200 +/- 50 J m(-2) K-1
   s(-1/2) for the SO2 frost surface and alpha(NF) approximate to 0.49 +/-
   0.02 and Gamma(NF) 20 +/- 10 J m(-2) K-1 s(-1/2) for the non-frost
   surface.
   These surface thermophysical parameters are then used as boundary
   conditions in global atmospheric simulations of Io's sublimation-driven
   atmosphere using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. These
   simulations are unsteady, three-dimensional, parallelized across 360
   processors, and include the following physical effects: inhomogeneous
   surface frosts, plasma heating, and a temperature-dependent residence
   time on the non-frost surface. The DSMC simulations show that the
   sub-jovian hemisphere is significantly affected by the daily solar
   eclipse. The simulated SO2 surface frost temperature is found to drop
   only similar to 5 K during eclipse due to the high thermal inertia of
   SO2 surface frosts but the SO2 gas column density falls by a factor of
   20 compared to the pre-eclipse column due to the exponential dependence
   of the SO2 vapor pressure on the SO2 surface frost temperature.
   Supersonic winds exist prior to eclipse but become subsonic during
   eclipse because the collapse of the atmosphere significantly decreases
   the day-to-night pressure gradient that drives the winds. Prior to
   eclipse, the supersonic winds condense on and near the cold nightside
   and form a highly non-equilibrium oblique shock near the dawn
   terminator. In eclipse, no shock exists since the gas is subsonic and
   the shock only reestablishes itself an hour or more after egress from
   eclipse. Furthermore, the excess gas that condenses on the non-frost
   surface during eclipse leads to an enhancement of the atmosphere near
   dawn. The dawn atmospheric enhancement drives winds that oppose those
   that are driven away from the peak pressure region above the warmest
   area of the SO2 frost surface. These opposing winds meet and are
   collisional enough to form stagnation point flow.
   The simulations are compared to Lyman-alpha observations in an attempt
   to explain the asymmetry between the dayside atmospheres of the
   anti-jovian and sub-jovian hemispheres. Lyman-alpha observations
   indicate that the anti-jovian hemisphere has higher column densities
   than the sub-jovian hemisphere and also has a larger latitudinal extent.
   A composite ``average dayside atmosphere{''} is formed from a
   collisionless simulation of to's atmosphere throughout an entire orbit.
   This composite ``average dayside{''} atmosphere without the effect of
   global winds indicates that the sub-jovian hemisphere has lower average
   column densities than the anti-jovian hemisphere (with the strongest
   effect at the sub-jovian point) due primarily to the diurnally averaged
   effect of eclipse. This is in qualitative agreement with the
   sub-jovian/anti-jovian asymmetry in the Lyman-alpha observations which
   were alternatively explained by the bias of volcanic centers on the
   anti-jovian hemisphere. Lastly, the column densities in the simulated
   average dayside atmosphere agree with those inferred from Lyman-alpha
   observations despite the thermophysical parameters being constrained by
   mid- to near UV observations which show much higher instantaneous SO2
   gas column densities. This may resolve the apparent discrepancy between
   the lower ``average dayside{''} column densities observed in the Lyman-a
   and the higher instantaneous column densities observed in the mid- to
   near UV. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AF Ablation in Octogenarians. Introduction: Radiofrequency catheter
   ablation (RFCA) is an effective treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF),
   although studies evaluating the role of RFCA have largely excluded
   elderly patients. We report the safety and outcomes of RFCA of AF in
   octogenarians. Methods and Results: From 2008 to 2011, out of 2,754
   consecutive patients undergoing RFCA of AF, 103 (3.7\%) had =80 years
   (age 85 +/- 3 years, 4 with >90 years). Pulmonary vein (PV) antrum
   isolation was performed in paroxysmal AF. In nonparoxysmal AF, ablation
   was extended to the entire left atrial posterior wall and to complex
   fractionated electrograms. Non-PV triggers were disclosed by
   isoproterenol challenge at the end of the procedure and targeted for
   ablation. Octogenarians presented a high rate of non-PV triggers (84\%
   vs 69\%, P = 0.001), especially in patients with paroxysmal AF (62\% vs
   19\%, P < 0.001); non-PV triggers were most commonly mapped in the
   coronary sinus (54\%), left atrial appendage (32\%), interatrial septum
   and superior vena cava (14\%). After a mean follow-up of 18 +/- 6
   months, 71 (69\%) octogenarians remained free from AF recurrence off
   antiarrhythmic drugs after a single procedure (vs 71\% in patients <80
   years, P = 0.65). The success rate reached 87\% after 2 procedures.
   Total periprocedural complication rates also did not differ between the
   2 age groups. Conclusions: RFCA of AF is safe and effective in
   octogenarians. A high rate of non-PV triggers is present in these
   patients, and targeting multiple structures other than the pulmonary
   veins is often necessary to achieve long-term success. (J Cardiovasc

Abstract = {{Accurate, real-time forecasting of coastal inundation due to hurricanes
   and tropical storms is a challenging computational problem requiring
   high-fidelity forward models of currents and water levels driven by
   hurricane-force winds. Despite best efforts in computational modeling
   there will always be uncertainty in storm surge forecasts. In recent
   years, there has been significant instrumentation located along the
   coastal United States for the purpose of collecting data specifically
   wind, water levels, and wave heights during these extreme events. This
   type of data, if available in real time, could be used in a data
   assimilation framework to improve hurricane storm surge forecasts. In
   this paper a data assimilation methodology for storm surge forecasting
   based on the use of ensemble Kalman filters and the advanced circulation
   (ADC RC) storm surge model is described. The singular evolutive
   interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter has been shown to be effective at
   producing accurate results for ocean models using small ensemble sizes
   initialized by an empirical orthogonal function analysis. The SEIK
   filter is applied to the ADCIRC model to improve storm surge
   forecasting, particularly in capturing maximum water levels (high water
   marks) and the timing of the surge. Two test cases of data obtained from
   hindcast studies of Hurricanes Ike and Katrina are presented. It is
   shown that a modified SEIK filter with an inflation factor improves the
   accuracy of coarse-resolution forecasts of storm surge resulting from
   hurricanes. Furthermore, the SEIK filter requires only modest
   computational resources to obtain more accurate forecasts of storm surge
   in a constrained time window where forecasters must interact with
   emergency responders.}},

Abstract = {{The augmentation of high strength fabrics with non-Newtonian fluids has
   been suggested as a means for improving the ballistic performance of
   fragment barrier materials widely used in fan blade containment, body
   armor, orbital debris shielding, and other applications.
   Magnetorheological (MR) fluids have attracted particular interest, in
   view of their controllability and proven effectiveness in a variety of
   damping applications. In a basic research investigation of the MR fluid
   augmented fabric barrier concept, the authors have fabricated MR fluid
   saturated Kevlar targets and measured the ballistic performance of these
   targets both with and without an applied magnetic field. The
   experimental results show that magnetization of the MR fluid does, when
   considered in isolation, improve the ability of the augmented fabric to
   absorb impact energy. However, the benefits of plastic and viscous
   energy dissipation in the magnetized semi-solid are more than offset by
   the detrimental effects of yarn lubrication associated with the fluid's
   hydrocarbon carrier. An analytical model developed to assist in the
   interpretation of the experimental data suggests that frictional
   interaction of the yarns is significantly more effective than
   magnetorheological augmentation of the fabric in distributing projectile
   loads away from the point of impact.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the investigation of spatial variations of impact-echo signals
   for different source and receiver locations, a simple multisensor data
   fusion strategy is proposed to increase the accuracy of nondestructive
   evaluation of concrete structures using the impact-echo test. The data
   fusion strategy fuses the ratios between spectral amplitudes of the
   delamination and concrete bottom echo signals (D/B ratios) from multiple
   source-receiver arrays. The fused D/B ratios demonstrate different
   characteristics for test locations above the delamination, above the
   sound concrete, and across the delamination boundary. These
   characteristics can be used to accurately locate the delamination and
   its boundaries without increasing testing time. The applicability of the
   multisensor data fusion for impact-echo testing is validated using both
   numerical simulation and experimental testings.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a novel integrated method for considering the
   economics of waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities with priced greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions based upon technical and economic characteristics of the
   WTE facility, MSW stream, landfill alternative, and GHG emissions
   policy. The study demonstrates use of the formulation for six different
   policy scenarios and explores sensitivity of the results to ranges of
   certain technical parameters as found in existing literature. The study
   shows that details of the GHG emissions regulations have large impact on
   the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of WTE and that GHG regulations can
   either increase or decrease the LCOE of WTE depending on policy choices
   regarding biogenic fractions from combusted waste and emissions from
   landfills. Important policy considerations are the fraction of the
   carbon emissions that are priced (i.e. all emissions versus only
   non-biogenic emissions), whether emissions credits are allowed due to
   reducing fugitive landfill gas emissions, whether biogenic carbon
   sequestration in landfills is credited against landfill emissions, and
   the effectiveness of the landfill gas recovery system where waste would
   otherwise have been buried. The default landfill gas recovery system
   effectiveness assumed by much of the industry yields GHG offsets that
   are very close to the direct non-biogenic GHG emissions from a WTE
   facility, meaning that small changes in the recovery effectiveness cause
   relatively larger changes in the emissions factor of the WTE facility.
   Finally, the economics of WTE are dependent on the MSW stream
   composition, with paper and wood being advantageous, metal and glass
   being disadvantageous, and plastics, food, and yard waste being either
   advantageous or disadvantageous depending upon the avoided tipping fee
   and the GHG emissions price. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Next-generation DNA sequencing platforms are becoming
   increasingly cost-effective and capable of providing enormous number of
   reads in a relatively short time. However, their accuracy and read
   lengths are still lagging behind those of conventional Sanger sequencing
   method. Performance of next-generation sequencing platforms is
   fundamentally limited by various imperfections in the
   sequencing-by-synthesis and signal acquisition processes. This drives
   the search for accurate, scalable and computationally tractable base
   calling algorithms capable of accounting for such imperfections.
   Results: Relying on a statistical model of the sequencing-by-synthesis
   process and signal acquisition procedure, we develop a computationally
   efficient base calling method for Illumina's sequencing technology
   (specifically, Genome Analyzer II platform). Parameters of the model are
   estimated via a fast unsupervised online learning scheme, which uses the
   generalized expectation-maximization algorithm and requires only 3 s of
   running time per tile (on an Intel i7 machine @3.07GHz, single core)-a
   three orders of magnitude speed-up over existing parametric model-based
   methods. To minimize the latency between the end of the sequencing run
   and the generation of the base calling reports, we develop a fast online
   scalable decoding algorithm, which requires only 9 s/tile and achieves
   significantly lower error rates than the Illumina's base calling
   software. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed online
   parameter estimation scheme efficiently computes tile-dependent
   parameters, which can thereafter be provided to the base calling
   algorithm, resulting in significant improvements over previously
   developed base calling methods for the considered platform in terms of
   performance, time/complexity and latency.}},

Abstract = {{Cre recombinase is a commonly-used genome editing tool suitable for
   site-specific integrations in mammalian genomes; however, the efficiency
   of transgenic swapping events compared to excision remains limited. Here
   we sought to identify important parameters and limiting factors that
   influence swapping propensity in this system, especially when using one
   wild-type loxP site. To modulate and increase the occurrence of swapping
   events, we identified two novel parameters. First, we identified the
   loxFAS-loxP pairing, a sequence never before used in mammalian systems,
   as the best choice for increasing swapping events in human cell lines.
   Second, for the first time we implicate the importance of delayed
   introduction of Cre DNA for optimal swapping efficiency. This same
   modification could potentially be of use to other systems catalyzing
   trimolecular reactions such as FC31 integrase and FLP recombinase where
   we hypothesize that transport of the exchange cassette is likewise
   initially rate limiting. The total number of recombination events, but
   not the ratio of swapping to excision, was found to be influenced by the
   quantity of Cre DNA transfected. Through this study, we were able to
   obtain Cre-mediated swapping frequencies of 8-12\% without antibiotic
   enrichment, which represents nearly an order of magnitude increase over
   prior reports in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{We study an old mathematical model, developed before the computer era,
   for analyzing the strength of a stiffened shell roof. The specific
   problem considered is a textbook example presented in K. Girkmann:
   Flachentragwerke, 3rd edition, 1954. Here the roof consists of a
   spherical dome and a stiffening ring of rectangular cross section
   attached to the edge of the dome. The problem is to compute the
   resultant force and moment acting at the junction of the dome and the
   ring. We approach the old model for solving the problem in two different
   ways. First we carry out a historical study, where we look for possible
   improvements of the old model while limiting ourselves to manual
   computations only. We find a variant of the model which, despite being
   about as simple as the original one, is considerably more accurate in
   comparison with recent numerical solutions based on FEM and axisymmetric
   3D elastic formulation of the problem. The second approach in our study
   is to carry out an a posteriori error analysis of our refined old model.
   The analysis is based on variational methods and on the Hypercircle
   theorem of the linear theory of elasticity. The error analysis confirms,
   and largely also explains, the observed - rather high - accuracy of the
   refined old mathematical model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   unstable plant. This restricts the resultant direction of the rate of
   change of the state to be the same as the direction of the desired

   feeder and Kirchhoff's circuit laws in estimating the fault voltage at
   the relay location and then use impedance-based methods for fault

Abstract = {{The transported probability density function (PDF) approach is a
   powerful technique for large eddy simulation (LES) based modeling of
   scramjet combustors. In this approach, a high-dimensional transport
   equation for the joint composition-enthalpy PDF needs to be solved.
   Quadrature based approaches provide deterministic Eulerian methods for
   solving the joint-PDF transport equation. In this work, it is first
   demonstrated that the numerical errors associated with LES require
   special care in the development of PDF solution algorithms. The direct
   quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) is one quadrature-based approach
   developed for supersonic combustion modeling. This approach is shown to
   generate inconsistent evolution of the scalar moments. Further,
   gradient-based source terms that appear in the DQMOM transport equations
   are severely underpredicted in LES leading to artificial mixing of fuel
   and oxidizer. To overcome these numerical issues, a semi-discrete
   quadrature method of moments (SeQMOM) is formulated. The performance of
   the new technique is compared with the DQMOM approach in canonical flow
   configurations as well as a three-dimensional supersonic cavity
   stabilized flame configuration. The SeQMOM approach is shown to predict
   subfilter statistics accurately compared to the DQMOM approach. (C) 2012

Title = {{Bayesian Network Classifiers for Set-Based Collaborative Design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Complex engineering design problems are often decomposed into a set of
   interdependent, distributed subproblems that are solved by
   domain-specific experts. These experts must resolve couplings between
   the subproblems and negotiate satisfactory, system-wide solutions.
   Set-based approaches help resolve these couplings by systematically
   mapping satisfactory regions of the design space for each subproblem and
   then intersecting those maps to identify mutually satisfactory
   system-wide solutions. In this paper, Bayesian network classifiers are
   introduced for mapping sets of promising designs, thereby classifying
   the design space into satisfactory and unsatisfactory regions. The
   approach is applied to two example problems-a spring design problem and
   a simplified, multilevel design problem for an unmanned aerial vehicle
   (UAV). The method is demonstrated to offer several advantages over
   competing techniques, including the ability to represent arbitrarily
   shaped and potentially disconnected regions of the design space and the
   ability to be updated straightforwardly as new information about the
   satisfactory design space is discovered. Although not demonstrated in
   this paper, it is also possible to interface the classifier with
   automated search and optimization techniques and to combine expert
   knowledge with the results of quantitative simulations when constructing
   the classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{GPS data for a year's worth of travel by 255 Seattle households
   illuminate how plug-in electric vehicles can match household needs. The
   results suggest that a battery-electric vehicle (BEV) with 100 mi of
   range should meet the needs of 50\% of one-vehicle households and 80\%
   of multiple-vehicle households, when charging once a day and relying on
   another vehicle or mode just 4 days a year. Moreover, the average
   one-vehicle Seattle household uses each vehicle 23 mi per day and should
   be able to electrify close to 80\% of its miles, while meeting all its
   travel needs, using a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) with
   40-mile all-electric range. Households owning two or more vehicles can
   electrify 50 to 70\% of their total household miles using a PHEV40,
   depending on how they assign the vehicle across drivers each day. Cost
   comparisons between the average single-vehicle household owning a
   Chevrolet Cruze versus a Volt PHEV suggest that, when gas prices are
   \$3.50 per gallon and electricity rates are at 11.2 ct/kWh, the Volt
   will save the household \$535 per year in operating costs. Similarly,
   the Toyota Prius PHEV will provide an annual savings of \$538 per year
   over the Corolla. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many wireless data communications systems, such as LTE, Wi-Fi, and
   Wimax, have become or are rapidly becoming interference limited due to
   radio frequency interference (RFI) generated by both human-made and
   natural sources. Human-made sources of RFI include uncoordinated devices
   operating in the same frequency band, devices communicating in adjacent
   frequency bands, and computational platform subsystems radiating clock
   frequencies and their harmonics. Additive RFI for these wireless systems
   has predominantly non-Gaussian statistics, and is well modeled by the
   Middleton Class A distribution for centralized networks, and the
   symmetric alpha stable distribution for decentralized networks. Our
   primary contribution is the derivation of joint spatial statistical
   models of RFI generated from uncoordinated interfering sources randomly
   distributed around a multiantenna receiver. The derivation is based on
   statistical-physical interference generation and propagation mechanisms.
   Prior results on joint statistics of multiantenna interference model
   either spatially independent or spatially isotropic interference, and do
   not provide a statistical-physical derivation for certain network
   environments. Our proposed joint spatial statistical model captures a
   continuum between spatially independent and spatially isotropic
   statistics, and hence includes many previous results as special cases.
   Practical applications include co-channel interference modeling for
   various wireless network environments, including wireless ad hoc,
   cellular, local area, and femtocell networks.}},

   containing domains of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, as has been
   done experimentally. Here we investigate the properties of such hybrid

Abstract = {{Alteration of the native mitral valve (MV) shape has been hypothesized
   to have a profound effect on the local tissue stress distribution, and
   is potentially linked to limitations in repair durability. The present
   study was undertaken to elucidate the relation between MV annular shape
   and central mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) strain history, using
   flat annuloplasty in an ovine model. In addition, we report for the
   first time the presence of residual in vivo leaflet strains. In vivo
   leaflet deformations were measured using sonocrystal transducers sutured
   to the MVAL (n = 10), with the 3D positions acquired over the full
   cardiac cycle. In six animals a flat ring was sutured to the annulus and
   the transducer positions recorded, while in the remaining four the MV
   was excised from the exsanguinated heart and the stress-free transducer
   positions obtained. In the central region of the MVAL the peak stretch
   values, referenced to the minimum left ventricular pressure (LVP), were
   1.10 +/- A 0.01 and 1.31 +/- A 0.03 (mean +/- A standard error) in the
   circumferential and radial directions, respectively. Following flat ring
   annuloplasty, the central MVAL contracted 28\% circumferentially and
   elongated 16\% radially at minimum LVP, and the circumferential
   direction was under a negative strain state during the entire cardiac
   cycle. After valve excision from the exsanguinated heart, the MVAL
   contracted significantly (18 and 30\% in the circumferential and radial
   directions, respectively), indicating the presence of substantial in
   vivo residual strains. While the physiological function of the residual
   strains (and their associated stresses) are at present unknown,
   accounting for their presence is clearly necessary for accurate
   computational simulations of MV function. Moreover, we demonstrated that
   changes in annular geometry dramatically alter valvular functional
   strains in vivo. As levels of homeostatic strains are related to tissue
   remodeling and homeostasis, our results suggest that surgically
   introduced alterations in MV shape could lead to the long term MV
   mechanobiological and microstructural alterations that could ultimately
   affect MV repair durability.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in functionality, power and intelligence of modern engineered
   systems led to complex systems with a large number of interconnected
   dynamic subsystems. In such machines, faults in one subsystem can
   cascade and affect the behavior of numerous other subsystems. This
   complicates the traditional fault monitoring procedures because of the
   need to train models of the faults that the monitoring system needs to
   detect and recognize. Unavoidable design defects, quality variations and
   different usage patterns make it infeasible to foresee all possible
   faults, resulting in limited diagnostic coverage that can only deal with
   previously anticipated and modeled failures. This leads to missed
   detections and costly blind swapping of acceptable components because of
   one's inability to accurately isolate the source of previously unseen
   anomalies. To circumvent these difficulties, a new paradigm for
   diagnostic systems is proposed and discussed in this paper. Its
   feasibility is demonstrated through application examples in automotive
   engine diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{We present two different ways to fabricate nitrogen-doped graphene
   (N-graphene) and demonstrate its use as a metal-free catalyst to study
   the catalytic active center for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
   N-graphene was produced by annealing of graphene oxide (G-O) under
   ammonia or by annealing of a N-containing polymer/reduced graphene oxide
   (RG-O) composite (polyaniline/RG-O or polypyrrole/RG-O). The effects of
   the N precursors and annealing temperature on the performance of the
   catalyst were investigated. The bonding state of the N atom was found to
   have a significant effect on the selectivity and catalytic activity for
   ORR. Annealing of G-O with ammonia preferentially formed graphitic N and
   pyridinic N centers, while annealing of polyaniline/RG-O and
   polypyrrole/RG-O tended to generate pyridinic and pyrrolic N moieties,
   respectively. Most importantly, the electrocatalytic activity of the
   catalyst was found to be dependent on the graphitic N content which
   determined the limiting current density, while the pyridinic N content
   improved the onset potential for ORR. However, the total N content in
   the graphene-based non-precious metal catalyst does not play an
   important role in the ORR process.}},

Abstract = {{Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from human adult peripheral
   blood and from human umbilical cord (uc) blood and the properties were
   compared in a series of in vitro bioassays. Quantification of growth
   factors in PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) fractions revealed
   increased levels of mitogenic growth factors PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and
   FGF-2, the angiogenic agent VEGF and the chemokine RANTES in ucPRP
   compared to adult PRP (aPRP) and PPP. To compare the ability of the
   various PRP products to stimulate proliferation of human bone marrow
   (BM), rat BM and compact bone (CB)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC),
   cells were cultured in serum-free media for 4 and 7 days with varying
   concentrations of PRP, PPP, or combinations of recombinant mitogens. It
   was found that while all forms of PRP and PPP were more mitogenic than
   fetal bovine serum, ucPRP resulted in significantly higher proliferation
   by 7 days than adult PRP and PPP. We observed that addition of as little
   as 0.1\% ucPRP caused greater proliferation of MSC effects than the most
   potent combination of recombinant growth factors tested, namely PDGF-AB
   PDGF-BB FGF-2, each at 10 ng/mL Similarly, in chemotaxis assays, ucPRP
   showed greater potency than adult PRP, PPP from either source, or indeed
   than combinations of either recombinant growth factors (PDGF, FGF, and
   TGF-beta 1) or chemokines previously shown to stimulate chemotactic
   migration of MSC. Lastly, we successfully demonstrated that PRP and PPP
   represented a viable alternative to FBS containing media for the
   cryo-preservation of MSC from human and rat BM. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for converting any unstructured
   quadrilateral or hexahedral mesh to a generalized T-spline surface or
   solid T-spline, based on the rational T-spline basis functions. Our
   conversion algorithm consists of two stages: the topology stage and the
   geometry stage. In the topology stage, the input quadrilateral or
   hexahedral mesh is taken as the initial T-mesh. To construct a gap-free
   T-spline, templates are designed for each type of node and applied to
   elements in the input mesh. In the geometry stage, an efficient surface
   fitting technique is developed to improve the surface accuracy with
   sharp feature preservation. The constructed T-spline surface and solid
   T-spline interpolate every boundary node in the input mesh, with C
   (2)-continuity everywhere except the local region around irregular
   nodes. Finally, a B,zier extraction technique is developed and linear
   independence of the constructed T-splines is studied to facilitate
   T-spline based isogeometric analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this concluding part of a series of papers on tetrahedral polynomial
   extension operators, the existence of a polynomial extension operator in
   the Sobolev space H(div) is proven constructively. Specifically, on any
   tetrahedron K, given a function w on the boundary partial derivative K
   that is a polynomial on each face, the extension operator applied to w
   gives a vector function whose components are polynomials of at most the
   same degree in the tetrahedron. The vector function is an extension in
   the sense that the trace of its normal component on the boundary partial
   derivative K coincides with w. Furthermore, the extension operator is
   continuous from H-1/2(partial derivative K) into H(div, K). The main
   application of this result and the results of this series of papers is
   the existence of commuting projectors with good hp-approximation

Abstract = {{The field of Metabolic Engineering has recently undergone a
   transformation that has led to a rapid expansion of the chemical palate
   of cells. Now, it is conceivable to produce nearly any organic molecule
   of interest using a cellular host. Significant advances have been made
   in the production of biofuels, biopolymers and precursors,
   pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, and commodity and specialty
   chemicals. Much of this rapid expansion in the field has been, in part,
   due to synergies and advances in the area of systems biology.
   Specifically, the availability of functional genomics, metabolomics and
   transcriptomics data has resulted in the potential to produce a wealth
   of new products, both natural and non-natural, in cellular factories.
   The sheer amount and diversity of this data however, means that
   uncovering and unlocking novel chemistries and insights is a non-obvious
   exercise. To address this issue, a number of computational tools and
   experimental approaches have been developed to help expedite the design
   process to create new cellular factories. This review will highlight
   many of the systems biology enabling technologies that have reduced the
   design cycle for engineered hosts, highlight major advances in the
   expanded diversity of products that can be synthesized, and conclude
   with future prospects in the field of metabolic engineering. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Traditional metabolic pathway engineering rarely considers the influence
   of molecular transport. Here, we describe the directed evolution of two
   heterologous transporters, Candida intermedia GXS1 and Scheffersomyces
   stipins XUT3. Growth rate on xylose was improved up to 70\% by mutant
   transporter expression. Most mutants were found to exhibit vastly
   improved V-max values and display an increase in high cell density sugar
   consumption rates. Mixed glucose and xylose fermentations reveal that
   mutant transporters can alter the diauxic shift dynamics and the
   simultaneous sugar utilization capacity of the host strain. Analysis of
   mutations highlights several important residues influencing transporter
   function including point mutations at F40 of C. intermedia GXS1 and at
   E538 of S. stipitis XUT3. This work is the first to demonstrate that
   molecular transporter proteins can be improved for biotechnological
   applications through directed evolution in yeast. (C)) 2012 Elsevier
