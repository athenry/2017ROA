Abstract = {{We describe the realization of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with
   accurate rotational alignment of individual layer crystal axes. We
   illustrate the approach by demonstrating a Bernal-stacked bilayer
   graphene formed using successive transfers of monolayer graphene flakes.
   The Raman spectra of this artificial bilayer graphene possess a wide 2D
   band, which is best fit by four Lorentzians, consistent with Bernal
   stacking. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals no moire pattern on the
   artificial bilayer graphene, and tunneling spectroscopy as a function of
   gate voltage reveals a constant density of states, also in agreement
   with Bernal, stacking. In addition, electron transport probed in
   dual-gated samples reveals a band gap opening as a function of
   transverse electric field. To illustrate the applicability of this
   technique to realize vdW heterostructuctures in which the functionality
   is critically dependent on rotational alignment, we demonstrate resonant
   tunneling double bilayer graphene heterostructures separated by
   hexagonal boron-nitride dielectric.}},

Title = {{Ultrasound-guided photoacoustic imaging-directed re-endothelialization
   of acellular vasculature leads to improved vascular performance}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{35-45}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{As increasing effort is dedicated to investigating the regenerative
   capacity of decellularized tissues, research has progressed to
   recellularizing these tissues prior to implantation. The delivery and
   support of cells seeded throughout acellular scaffolds are typically
   conducted through the vascular axis of the tissues. However, it is
   unclear how cell concentration and injection frequency can affect the
   distribution of cells throughout the scaffold. Furthermore, what effects
   re-endothelialization have on vascular patency and function are not well
   understood. We investigated the use of ultrasound-guided photoacoustic
   (US/PA) imaging as a technique to visualize the distribution of
   microvascular endothelial cells within an optimized acellular construct
   upon re-endothelialization and perfusion conditioning. We also evaluated
   the vascular performance of the re-endothelialized scaffold using
   quantitative vascular corrosion casting (qVCC) and whole-blood
   perfusion. We found US/PA imaging was an effective technique to
   visualize the distribution of cells. Cellular retention following
   perfusion conditioning was also detected with US/PA imaging. Finally, we
   demonstrated that a partial recovery of vascular performance is possible
   following re-endothelialization confirmed by fewer extravasations in
   qVCC and improved blood clearance following whole-blood perfusion.
   Statement of Significance
   Re-endothelialization is a method that enables decellularized tissue to
   become useful as a tissue engineering construct by creating a nutrient
   delivery and waste removal system for the entire construct. Our approach
   utilizes a decellularization method that retains the basement ECM of a
   highly vascularized tissue upon which endothelial cells can be injected
   to form an endothelium. The US/PA method allows for rapid visualization
   of cells within a construct several cm thick. This approach can be
   experimentally used to observe changes in cellular distribution over
   large intervals of time, to help optimize cell seeding parameters, and
   to verify cell retention within re-endothelialized constructs. This
   approach has temporal and depth advantages compared to section
   reconstruction and imaged fluorophores respectively. (C) 2015 Acta

Title = {{A meso-scale layer-specific structural constitutive model of the mitral
   heart valve leaflets}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{238-255}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Fundamental to developing a deeper understanding of pathophysiological
   remodeling in mitral valve (MV) disease is the development of an
   accurate tissue-level constitutive model. In the present work, we
   developed a novel meso-scale (i.e. at the level of the fiber, 10-100 mu
   m in length scale) structural constitutive model (MSSCM) for MV leaflet
   tissues. Due to its four-layer structure, we focused on the
   contributions from the distinct collagen and elastin fiber networks
   within each tissue layer. Requisite collagen and elastin fibrous
   structural information for each layer were quantified using second
   harmonic generation microscopy and conventional histology. A
   comprehensive mechanical dataset was also used to guide model
   formulation and parameter estimation. Furthermore, novel to tissue-level
   structural constitutive modeling approaches, we allowed the collagen
   fiber recruitment function to vary with orientation. Results indicated
   that the MSSCM predicted a surprisingly consistent mean effective
   collagen fiber modulus of 162.72 MPa, and demonstrated excellent
   predictive capability for extra-physiological loading regimes. There
   were also anterior-posterior leaflet-specific differences, such as
   tighter collagen and elastin fiber orientation distributions (ODF) in
   the anterior leaflet, and a thicker and stiffer atrialis in the
   posterior leaflet. While a degree of angular variance was observed, the
   tight valvular tissue ODF also left little room for any physically
   meaningful angular variance in fiber mechanical responses. Finally, a
   novel fibril-level (0.1-1 mu m) validation approach was used to compare
   the predicted collagen fiber/fibril mechanical behavior with extant MV
   small angle X-ray scattering data. Results demonstrated excellent
   agreement, indicating that the MSSCM fully captures the tissue-level
   function. Future utilization of the MSSCM in computational models of the
   MV will aid in producing highly accurate simulations in non
   physiological loading states that can occur in repair situations, as
   well as guide the form of simplified models for real-time simulation
   tools. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Locomotor Adaptability Task Promotes Intense and Task-Appropriate Output

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{493-496}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To test the hypothesis that participants with stroke will
   exhibit appropriate increase in muscle activation of the paretic leg
   when taking a long step with the nonparetic leg compared to during
   steady-state walking, with a consequent increase in biomechanical output
   and symmetry during the stance phase of the modified gait cycle.
   Design: Single-session observational study.
   Setting: Clinical research center in an outpatient hospital setting.
   Participants: Adults with chronic poststroke hemiparesis (N=15).
   Interventions: Participants walked on an instrumented treadmill while
   kinetic, kinematic, and electromyogram data were recorded. Participants
   performed steady-state walking and a separate trial of the long-step
   adaptability task in which they were instructed to intermittently take a
   longer step with the nonparetic leg.
   Main Outcome Measures: Forward progression, propulsive force, and
   neuromuscular activation during walking.
   Results: Participants performed the adaptability task successfully and
   demonstrated greater neuromuscular activation in appropriate paretic leg
   muscles, particularly increased activity in paretic plantarflexor
   muscles. Propulsion and forward progression by the paretic leg were also
   increased.
   Conclusions: These findings support the assertion that the nonparetic
   long-step task may be effective for use in poststroke locomotor
   rehabilitation to engage the paretic leg and promote recovery of
   walking. (C) 2016 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine}},

Title = {{Binimetinib inhibits MEK and is effective against neuroblastoma tumor
   cells with low NF1 expression}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Novel therapies are needed for children with high-risk and
   relapsed neuroblastoma. We hypothesized that MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)
   inhibition with the novel MEK1/2 inhibitor binimetinib would be
   effective in neuroblastoma preclinical models.
   Methods: Levels of total and phosphorylated MEK and extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were examined in primary neuroblastoma
   tumor samples and in neuroblastoma cell lines by Western blot. A panel
   of established neuroblastoma tumor cell lines was treated with
   increasing concentrations of binimetinib, and their viability was
   determined using MTT assays. Western blot analyses were performed to
   examine changes in total and phosphorylated MEK and ERK and to measure
   apoptosis in neuroblastoma tumor cells after binimetinib treatment. NF1
   protein levels in neuroblastoma cell lines were determined using Western
   blot assays. Gene expression of NF1 and MEK1 was examined in
   relationship to neuroblastoma patient outcomes.
   Results: Both primary neuroblastoma tumor samples and cell lines showed
   detectable levels of total and phosphorylated MEK and ERK. IC50 values
   for cells sensitive to binimetinib ranged from 8 nM to 1.16 mu M, while
   resistant cells did not demonstrate any significant reduction in cell
   viability with doses exceeding 15 mu M. Sensitive cells showed higher
   endogenous expression of phosphorylated MEK and ERK. Gene expression of
   NF1, but not MEK1, correlated with patient outcomes in neuroblastoma,
   and NF1 protein expression also correlated with responses to
   binimetinib.
   Conclusions: Neuroblastoma tumor cells show a range of sensitivities to
   the novel MEK inhibitor binimetinib. In response to binimetinib,
   sensitive cells demonstrated complete loss of phosphorylated ERK, while
   resistant cells demonstrated either incomplete loss of ERK
   phosphorylation or minimal effects on MEK phosphorylation, suggesting
   alternative mechanisms of resistance. NF1 protein expression correlated
   with responses to binimetinib, supporting the use of NF1 as a biomarker
   to identify patients that may respond to MEK inhibition. MEK inhibition
   therefore represents a potential new therapeutic strategy for
   neuroblastoma.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, building information modeling (BIM) has been
   increasingly applied in design coordination of mechanical, electrical,

   developed knowledge representation schema to capture coordination
   information generated in the BIM-based design coordination process. A

Abstract = {{MRI characteristics of brain gliomas have been used to predict clinical
   outcome and molecular tumor characteristics. However, previously
   reported imaging biomarkers have not been sufficiently accurate or
   reproducible to enter routine clinical practice and often rely on
   relatively simple MRI measures. The current study leverages advanced
   image analysis and machine learning algorithms to identify complex and
   reproducible imaging patterns predictive of overall survival and
   molecular subtype in glioblastoma (GB).
   One hundred five patients with GB were first used to extract
   approximately 60 diverse features from preoperative multiparametric
   MRIs. These imaging features were used by a machine learning algorithm
   to derive imaging predictors of patient survival and molecular subtype.
   Cross-validation ensured generalizability of these predictors to new
   patients. Subsequently, the predictors were evaluated in a prospective
   cohort of 29 new patients.
   Survival curves yielded a hazard ratio of 10.64 for predicted long
   versus short survivors. The overall, 3-way (long/medium/short survival)
   accuracy in the prospective cohort approached 80\%. Classification of
   patients into the 4 molecular subtypes of GB achieved 76\% accuracy.
   By employing machine learning techniques, we were able to demonstrate
   that imaging patterns are highly predictive of patient survival.
   Additionally, we found that GB subtypes have distinctive imaging
   phenotypes. These results reveal that when imaging markers related to
   infiltration, cell density, microvascularity, and blood-brain barrier
   compromise are integrated via advanced pattern analysis methods, they
   form very accurate predictive biomarkers. These predictive markers used
   solely preoperative images, hence they can significantly augment
   diagnosis and treatment of GB patients.}},

Abstract = {{Bioprospecting is an effective way to find novel enzymes from strains
   with desirable phenotypes. Such bioprospecting has enabled organisms
   such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae to utilize nonnative pentose sugars.
   Yet, the efficiency of this pentose catabolism (especially for the case
   of arabinose) remains suboptimal. Thus, further pathway optimization or
   identification of novel, optimal pathways is needed. Previously, we
   identified a novel set of xylan catabolic pathway enzymes from a
   superior pentose-utilizing strain of Ustilago bevomyces. These enzymes
   were used to successfully engineer a xylan-utilizing S. cerevisiae
   through a blended approach of bioprospecting and evolutionary
   engineering. Here, we expanded this approach to xylose and arabinose
   catabolic pathway engineering and demonstrated that bioprospected xylose
   and arabinose catabolic pathways from U. bevomyces offer alternative
   choices for enabling efficient pentose catabolism in S. cerevisiae. By
   introducing a novel set of xylose catabolic genes from U. bevomyces,
   growth rates were improved up to 85 \% over a set of traditional
   Scheffersomyces stipitis pathway genes. In addition, we suggested an
   alternative arabinose catabolic pathway which, after directed evolution
   and pathway engineering, enabled S. cerevisiae to grow on arabinose as a
   sole carbon source in minimal medium with growth rates upwards of 0.05
   h(-1). This pathway represents the most efficient growth of yeast on
   pure arabinose minimal medium. These pathways provide great starting
   points for further strain development and demonstrate the utility of
   bioprospecting from U. bevomyces.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional thermoelectric generators (TEGs) used in applications such
   as exhaust heat recovery are typically limited in terms of power density
   due to their low efficiency. Additionally, they are generally costly due
   to the bulk use of rare-earth elements such as tellurium. If less
   material could be used for the same output, then the power density and
   the overall cost per kilowatt (kW) of electricity produced could drop
   significantly, making TEGs a more attractive solution for energy
   harvesting of waste heat. The present work assesses the effect of
   reducing the amount of thermoelectric (TE) material used (namely by
   reducing the module thickness) on the electrical output of conventional
   bismuth telluride TEGs. Commercial simulation packages (ANSYS CFX and
   thermal-electric) and bespoke models were used to simulate the TEGs at
   various degrees of detail. Effects such as variation of the thermal and
   electrical contact resistance and the component thickness and the effect
   of using an element supporting matrix (e.g., eggcrate) instead of having
   air conduction in void areas have been assessed. It was found that
   indeed it is possible to reduce the use of bulk TE material while
   retaining power output levels equivalent to thicker modules. However,
   effects such as thermal contact resistance were found to become
   increasingly important as the active TE material thickness was
   decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoelectric generators can be used in automotive exhaust energy
   recovery. As car engines operate under wide variable loads, it is a
   challenge to design a system for operating efficiently under these
   variable conditions. This means being able to avoid excessive thermal
   dilution under low engine loads and being able to operate under high
   load, high temperature events without the need to deflect the exhaust
   gases with bypass systems. The authors have previously proposed a
   thermoelectric generator (TEG) concept with temperature control based on
   the operating principle of the variable conductance heat
   pipe/thermosiphon. This strategy allows the TEG modules' hot face to
   work under constant, optimized temperature. The variable engine load
   will only affect the number of modules exposed to the heat source, not
   the heat transfer temperature. This prevents module overheating under
   high engine loads and avoids thermal dilution under low engine loads.
   The present work assesses the merit of the aforementioned approach by
   analysing the generator output during driving cycles simulated with an
   energy model of a light vehicle. For the baseline evaporator and
   condenser configuration, the driving cycle averaged electrical power
   outputs were approximately 320 W and 550 W for the type-approval
   Worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure Class 3 driving cycle
   and for a real-world highway driving cycle, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{With an aim to understand the origin of the low thermal expansion
   coefficients (TECs), cation substituted YBaCo4O7-type oxides have been
   investigated by in-situ neutron diffraction, bond valence sum (BVS),
   thermogravimetric analysis, and dilatometry. The compositions
   YBaCo3ZnO7+delta, Y(0.9)ln(0.1)BaCo(3)ZnO(7+delta), and
   Y(0.9)ln(0.1)BaCo(3)Zn(0.6)Fe(0.4)O(7+delta) were synthesized by
   solid-state reaction at 1200 degrees C. Rietveld refinement of the joint
   synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction data shows that the Zn and Fe
   dopants have different preferences to substitute the Co ions in the 6c
   and 2a sites. The bulk thermal-expansion coefficients of
   YBaCo3ZnO7+delta, Y(0.9)ln(0.1)BaCo(3)ZnO(7+delta), and
   Y(0.9)ln(0.1)BaCo(3)Zn(0.6)Fe(0.4)O(7+delta) are, respectively, 9.42,
   9.76, and 9.06 x 10(-6) degrees C-1. Neutron diffraction data show that
   the low anisotropic TEC along the a-axis is the main contributor to the
   low bulk TECs. With the substitution of In, Zn, and Fe in
   Y(0.9)ln(0.1)BaCo(3)Zn(0.6)Fe(0.4)O(7+delta), the anisotropic and bulk
   TECs could be reduced to 8.94 and 9.06 x 10(-6) degrees C-1,
   respectively, mainly due to the suppression of the change in Co-O bond
   length in CoO4 polyhedra. The observed weight loss during heating is due
   to the loss of interstitial oxide ions, as revealed by neutron
   diffraction and BVS map. Y(0.9)ln(0.1)BaCo(3)Zn(0.6)Fe(0.4)O(7+delta)
   has the lowest area-specific cathodic polarization resistance of 0.14

Abstract = {{Percolation theory is used to model intrinsic and relative
   permeabilities as well as tortuosity in anisotropic carbon paper gas
   diffusion layers (GDL) and compared with existing results from lattice
   Boltzmann (LB) simulations and experimental measurements. Although
   single- and two-phase characteristics of the carbon paper GDL are mainly
   affected by medium geometrical and topological properties, e.g.,
   pore-size distribution, connectivity, and pore geometry, analyzing
   capillary pressure curves implies that the pore-size distribution of the
   carbon paper GDL is very narrow. This suggests that its effect on
   tortuosity and wetting- and nonwetting-phase relative permeabilities is
   trivial. However, integrated effects of pore geometry, surface area,
   connectivity, and tortuosity on intrinsic permeability might be
   substantial. Universal power laws from percolation theory predict the
   tortuosity-porosity and relative permeability saturation curves
   accurately, indicating both characteristics not affected by the
   pore-size distribution. The permeability porosity relationship, however,
   conforms to nonuniversality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Analysis of the effect of the fluid-structure interface on elastic wave

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Air-pulse optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a promising technique
   for quantifying biomechanical properties of the cornea. This technique
   typically involves imaging and analysis of the propagation of the
   air-pulse induced elastic waves to reconstruct corneal biomechanical
   properties using an analytical model. However, the effect of the
   fluid-structure interface (FSI) at the corneal posterior surface on the
   elastic wave velocity is not accounted for in many models. In this
   study, we examined the effect of the FSI with OCE experiments on contact
   lenses with and without fluid in the posterior gap. Finite element
   models (FEM), also with and without the FSI, were constructed to
   simulate the elastic wave propagation based on the OCE measurements. The
   FEM and OCE results were in good agreement demonstrating the feasibility
   of the method. To further investigate the effect of the FSI, OCE
   experiments and subsequent FEM simulations were conducted on in situ
   rabbit corneas before and after rose bengal/green light corneal collagen
   cross-linking (RGX). Both the OCE experiments and the FE simulations
   demonstrated that the FSI significantly reduced the group velocity of
   the elastic wave, and thus, should be considered when determining
   corneal biomechanical properties from an appropriate mechanical model.
   By matching the FEM-calculated velocity to the OCE-measured velocity,
   the corneal elasticity was quantified. The Young's modulus of the rabbit
   cornea before RGX was E = 65 +/- 10 kPa at a controlled intraocular
   pressure (IOP) of 15 mmHg. After RGX, the Young's modulus increased to E
   = 102 +/- 7 kPa at the same IOP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive study on the rigid block sliding
   displacement of slopes subjected to ground motions with large velocity
   pulses. A comparison of the performance of various existing empirical
   displacement models is provided through analyses of the displacement
   residuals of slopes subject to pulse-like motions. Except for the PGA-
   and PGV-based Saygili and Rathje model (2008, referred to as SR08),
   positive medians of residuals are observed for selected models,
   indicating an underestimation. There is a negative constant shift in the
   total residuals for the SR08 model, which can be easily fixed by
   changing the constant term in the predictive equation. The residuals
   from the SR08 model also have the smallest standard deviation compared
   to the other models. A modified SR08 model is developed for predicting
   rigid block sliding displacements for pulse-like motions. The modified
   predictive model is used in probabilistic seismic displacement analyses
   of slopes in a hypothetical near-fault region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   stores for HVAC applications}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{133-144}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Thermal energy stores can be used to shift building peak electric loads
   for cooling to off-peak hours. Compact, high-density thermal storage
   solutions are required for buildings that may not have the space
   necessary for typical thermal storage systems, such as chilled water
   tanks. Previous studies show that latent thermal stores using polymer
   tube-encapsulated paraffin-based phase change materials (PCM) yield
   acceptable thermal performance at low to moderate encapsulation tube
   packing densities, but that thermal performance falls as tube packing
   densities climb due to increasingly restricted heat transfer fluid (HTF)
   flow paths. This paper reports the experimental results found when using
   a highly conductive encapsulation material to redistribute the thermal
   energy around the PCM, mitigating the effect of the restricted HTF flow
   paths and enabling maximum encapsulation tube packing densities. These
   experiments show a more than two-fold increase in the percentage of
   recoverable thermal energy over a similar polymer tube based system,
   providing thermal performance comparable to that of a low density
   polymer tube encapsulation system while increasing PCM capacity by
   111\%. Test results are provided in a format suitable for estimating
   design criteria for larger thermal stores, and a design parameter the
   resistance ratio is proposed to assist in optimizing encapsulation tube
   parameters. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers large random wireless networks, where
   transmit-and-receive node pairs communicate within a certain range while
   sharing a common spectrum. By modeling the spatial locations of nodes as
   a Poisson point process, analytical expressions for the ergodic spectral
   efficiency of a typical node pair are derived as a function of the
   channel state information available at a receiver (CSIR) in terms of
   relevant system parameters: the density of communication links, the
   number of receive antennas, the path loss exponent, and the operating
   signal-to-noise ratio. One key finding is that when the receiver only
   exploits CSIR for the direct link, the sum spectral efficiency increases
   linearly with the density, provided the number of receive antennas
   increases as a certain superlinear function of the density. When each
   receiver exploits CSIR for a set of dominant interfering links in
   addition to that of the direct link, the sum spectral efficiency
   increases linearly with both the density and the path loss exponent if
   the number of antennas is a linear function of the density. This
   observation demonstrates that having CSIR for dominant interfering links
   provides an order gain in the scaling law. It is also shown that this
   linear scaling holds for direct CSIR when incorporating the effect of
   the receive antenna correlation, provided that the rank of the spatial
   correlation matrix scales superlinearly with the density. These scaling
   laws are derived from integral representations of the distribution of
   the signal to interference and noise ratio, which are of independent
   interest and which in turn derived from stochastic geometry and more
   precisely from the theory of shot noise fields. Simulation results back
   the scaling laws and the integral representations.}},

Abstract = {{While the phenomenon of excess vehicle emissions from cold-start
   conditions is well known, the magnitude and duration of this phenomenon
   is often unclear due to the complex chemical processes involved and
   uncertainty in the literature on this subject. This paper synthesizes
   key findings regarding the influence of ambient and engine temperatures
   on light-duty vehicle (LDV) emissions. Existing literature, as well as
   analytical tools like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Motor
   Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES), indicate that while total vehicle
   emissions have dropped significantly in recent years, those associated
   with cold starts can still constitute up to 80\% for some pollutant
   species. Starting emissions are consistently found to make up a high
   proportion of total transportation-related methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
   (N2O), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). After 3-4 min of vehicle
   operation, both the engine coolant and the catalytic converter have
   generally warmed, and emissions are significantly lower. This effect
   lasts roughly 45 min after the engine is shut off, though the cooling
   rate depends greatly on the emission species and ambient temperature.
   Electrically (pre-)heated catalysts, using the bigger batteries
   available on hybrid drivetrains and plug-in vehicles, may be the most
   cost-effective technology to bring down a sizable share of mobile source
   emissions. Trip chaining (to keep engines warm) and shifting to
   non-motorized modes for shorter trips, where the cold start can dominate
   emissions, are also valuable tactics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   describing a DWC are highly coupled and nonlinear, making DWC-based
   process flowsheets challenging to simulate. Design optimization poses
   further challenges, typically requiring integer variables to select the
   number of column stages. To address these difficulties, we represent
   DWCs as networks of pseudo-transient (differential-algebraic) subunit
   models. We show that these networks have the same steady-state solution
   as the original (algebraic) MESH equations, but present significant
   numerical benefits. We then embed these models in a previously developed
   pseudo-transient flowsheet modeling and optimization framework. We
   further reformulate the models to require only continuous decision
   variables when selecting the optimal number of stages during design
   optimization. To illustrate these concepts, we discuss the DWC-based
   intensification of the dimethyl ether process. (c) 2015 American

   anode catalysts, Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d) (Ln = La, Nd,
   and Sm) have been studied by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) in
   order to determine the effects of various lanthanide substitution in
   complex perovskites for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel
   cells (HT-SOFC). The charge state of lanthanide ions remained at 3+ and
   the binding energies of the lanthanide ions in
   Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d) were located in a relatively
   lower range compared to those of conventional lanthanide oxides. Mn and
   Ti were regarded as charge compensation components in
   Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d); Mn was more influential than Ti.
   In the cases of substituting Nd and Sm into
   Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d), some portion of Ti showed
   metallic behavior; the specific Mn satellite peak indicating an
   electro-catalytic effect had occurred. Three types of oxygen species
   comprised of lattice oxygen, carbonate species, and adsorbed oxygen
   species were observed in Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d) from the
   0 is spectra; a high portion of lattice oxygen was observed in both
   Nd0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3 +/- d (NSTM) and Sm0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3 +/- d
   (SSTM). In various respects, NSTM and SSTM will be desirable reforming

Abstract = {{Policymakers, consumers, and industry leaders are increasingly concerned
   about the environmental impacts of modern products. In response, product
   designers seek simple and effective methods for lowering the
   environmental footprints of their concepts. Design for environment (DfE)
   is a field of product design methodology that includes tools, methods,
   and principles to help designers reduce environmental impact. The most
   powerful and well-known tool for DfE is life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA
   requires a fully specified design, however, which makes it applicable
   primarily at the end of the design process. Because the decisions with
   the greatest environmental impact are made during early design stages
   when data for a comprehensive LCA are not yet available, it is important
   to develop DfE tools that can be implemented in the early conceptual and
   embodiment design stages. Based on a broad critical review of DfE
   literature and best practices, a set of 76 DfE guidelines are compiled
   and reconciled for use in early stage design of products with minimal
   environmental impact. Select guidelines are illustrated through
   examples, and several strategies for using the guidelines are
   introduced.}},

Title = {{Necessity of porosity correction before simulation and re-understanding
   of the effects of gas adsorption on production in shale gas reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{162-170}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Shale gas contains free gas and adsorbed gas in matrix pores. The size
   of matrix pore is on the order of nanometer, large specific surface area
   makes the adsorbed gas occupy a large part of the total void volume.
   However, most widely used simulators ignore the volume reduction of free
   gas due to adsorbed gas, resulting in the OGIP errors. In order to make
   the simulation results be more reasonable and accurate, firstly, we
   derived the correction formulas of bulk porosity, free gas saturation
   and connate water saturation used for converting measured data into
   simulation model. Then, the matrix porosity, gas saturation and connate
   water saturation are corrected to match the original gas in place (OGIP)
   and the production data of Barnett Shale. Finally, the effects of gas
   adsorption on gas production in Barnett Shale with porosity correction
   are studied. The results show that porosity correction is significantly
   necessary before inputting the measured parameters into a simulator. In
   Barnett Shale, the adsorbed gas takes up 1/4 of the total void volume,
   if this partial volume is ignored, the free gas storage capacity and
   OGIP will be overestimated by 52.49\% and 25.5\%, respectively. The
   cumulative gas production will be much higher without porosity
   correction due to the artificial increasing of the free gas volume in
   the model which should be occupied by adsorbed gas in reality. The
   adsorption effect of shale gas is adverse to the development of shale
   gas. Only a little fraction of the adsorbed gas contributes to gas
   production in the late stage. For Barnett Shale, the recovery factor of
   free gas is about three times of adsorbed gas; the gas recovery factor
   in the near-wellbore region is about two times of the gas recovery
   factor in the whole reservoir. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{119}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Suspended-zipper braced frame is a modified configuration of chevron
   braced frame in which zipper columns are added between story beams and a
   hat truss is attached between top two stories in order to redistribute
   the unbalanced vertical forces emerging following the brace buckling to
   avoid the use of deep beams. In this study, three- and nine-story
   chevron and suspended-zipper braced frames are analyzed to compare their
   seismic performances. The beams, columns, braces and zipper columns are
   modeled using nonlinear force-formulation frame elements and nonlinear
   geometric effects are included by utilizing corotational transformation.
   Nonlinear static analyses are performed until reaching a roof drift
   ratio of 3\% and a set of twenty ground motion records scaled to match a
   10\% probability of exceedance in 50 years is used for nonlinear
   time-history analysis. The results appear to indicate that the lateral
   load capacity and drift demands for both low-rise chevron and suspended
   zipper braced frames are very similar; however, the mid-rise chevron
   braced frame has a better performance compared to the mid-rise
   suspended-zipper braced frame. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We proposed an adjoint-based inverse method and mathematical solutions
   using Lagrange multiplier theorem for inferring dynamic viscoelastic
   properties of heterogeneous structures with displacement observations to
   improve computation reliability and efficiency. Existing methods such as
   the one using finite-difference approximated gradient may not be
   efficient and accurate enough for considering complex situations of the
   coupled effects of dynamic loading, material deformation memory, and
   structural heterogeneity. The proposed method derives both gradient and
   Hessian mathematically to satisfy the first-order necessary and
   second-order sufficient optimal conditions, which has great advantages
   compared to other approaches. We also proposed robust numerical
   algorithms for accurate and fast computations, including a
   regularization to control reasonable parameter ranges, a Newton's method
   with Hessian function to determine search direction for fast
   convenience, and a modified Armijo rule to find a stable step length. We
   developed a Galerkin time-domain finite-element method for numerical
   solutions of resulting partial differential equations, and validated the
   model for a layered structure under dynamic loading tests. Results
   indicate that the proposed method has greatly improved computation
   accuracy and speed as compared to existing approaches. It may be applied

Abstract = {{High-throughput sequencing of the variable domains of immune receptors
   (antibodies and T cell receptors (TCRs)) is of key importance in the
   understanding of adaptive immune responses in health and disease.
   However, the sequencing of both immune receptor chains (VH+VL or TCR
   beta/delta+TCR alpha/gamma) at the single-cell level for typical samples
   containing > 10(4) lymphocytes is problematic, because immune receptors
   comprise two polypeptide chains that are encoded by separate mRNAs. Here
   we present a technology that allows rapid and low-cost determination of
   a paired immune receptor repertoire from millions of cells with high
   precision (> 97\%). Flow focusing is used to encapsulate single cells in
   emulsions containing magnetic beads for mRNA capture. The mRNA
   transcripts are then reverse-transcribed, physically linked to their
   partners by overlap extension PCR, and interrogated by high-throughput
   paired-end Illumina sequencing. This protocol describes the construction
   and operation of the flow-focusing device in detail, as well as the
   bioinformatics pipeline used to interpret the data. The entire procedure
   can be performed by a single researcher in under 12 h of effort per

Title = {{Emulation of higher-order tensors in manifold Monte Carlo methods for
   Bayesian Inverse Problems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{308}},
Pages = {{81-101}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The Bayesian approach to Inverse Problems relies predominantly on Markov
   Chain Monte Carlo methods for posterior inference. The typical nonlinear
   concentration of posterior measure observed in many such Inverse
   Problems presents severe challenges to existing simulation based
   inference methods. Motivated by these challenges the exploitation of
   local geometric information in the form of covariant gradients, metric
   tensors, Levi-Civita connections, and local geodesic flows have been
   introduced to more effectively locally explore the configuration space
   of the posterior measure. However, obtaining such geometric quantities
   usually requires extensive computational effort and despite their
   effectiveness affects the applicability of these geometrically-based
   Monte Carlo methods. In this paper we explore one way to address this
   issue by the construction of an emulator of the model from which all
   geometric objects can be obtained in a much more computationally
   feasible manner. The main concept is to approximate the geometric
   quantities using a Gaussian Process emulator which is conditioned on a
   carefully chosen design set of configuration points, which also
   determines the quality of the emulator. To this end we propose the use
   of statistical experiment design methods to refine a potentially
   arbitrarily initialized design online without destroying the convergence
   of the resulting Markov chain to the desired invariant measure. The
   practical examples considered in this paper provide a demonstration of
   the significant improvement possible in terms of computational loading
   suggesting this is a promising avenue of further development. (C) 2015

   quenching}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{Heat transfer associated with boiling degrades at elevated temperatures
   due to the formation of an insulating vapor layer at the solid-liquid
   interface (Leidenfrost effect). Interfacial electrowetting (EW) fields
   can disrupt this vapor layer to promote liquid-surface wetting. We
   experimentally analyze EW-induced disruption of the vapor layer and
   measure the resulting enhanced cooling during the process of quenching.
   Imaging is employed to visualize the fluid-surface interactions and
   understand boiling patterns in the presence of an electrical voltage. It
   is seen that EW fields fundamentally change the boiling pattern, wherein
   a stable vapor layer is replaced by intermittent wetting of the surface.
   Heat conduction across the vapor gap is thus replaced with transient
   convection. This fundamental switch in the heat transfer mode
   significantly accelerates cooling during quenching. An order of
   magnitude increase in the cooling rate is observed, with the heat
   transfer seen approaching saturation at higher voltages. An analytical
   model is developed to extract voltage dependent heat transfer rates from
   the measured cooling curve. The results show that electric fields can
   alter and tune the traditional cooling curve. Overall, this study
   presents an ultralow power consumption concept to control the mechanical
   properties and metallurgy, by electrically tuning the cooling rate
   during quenching. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Equilibrium partitioning of ions between a membrane and a contiguous

   membranes used for water purification and energy generation
   applications. This study presents a theoretical framework to
   quantitatively predict ion sorption from aqueous electrolytes (e.g.,
   NaCl, MgCl2) into charged (i.e., ion exchange) polymers. The model was
   compared with experimental NaCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 sorption data in
   commercial cation and anion exchange membranes. Ion sorption in charged
   polymers was modeled using a thermodynamic approach based on Donnan
   theory coupled with Manning's counter-ion condensation theory to
   describe non-ideal behavior of ions in the membrane. Ion activity
   coefficients in solution were calculated using the Pitzer model. The
   resulting model, with no adjustable parameters, provides remarkably good
   agreement with experimental values of membrane mobile salt
   concentration. The generality of the model was further demonstrated
   using literature data for ion sorption of various electrolytes in
   charged polymers, including HCl sorption in Nafion.}},

   Si0.4Sn0.6}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Mg2SixSn1-x has been widely studied as a thermoelectric material owing
   to its high figure-of-merit, low cost, and non-toxicity. However, its
   electronic structure, particularly when the material contains Mg
   vacancies, has not been adequately described. The n-type nature of
   Mg-2-delta Si0.4Sn0.6 has been a puzzle. Mg deficiency can be present in
   Mg2SixSn1-x due to Mg evaporation and oxidation. Therefore, an
   investigation of the role of Mg vacancies is of great interest. In this
   work, we have prepared a series of samples with various Mg deficiency
   and Sb doping levels and measured their transport properties. The
   Seebeck coefficient of these samples all reveals n-type conduction. We
   propose that Mg vacancies in Mg2SixSn1-x create localized hole states
   inside the band gap instead of simply moving the Fermi-level into the
   valence band as would be predicted by a rigid band model. Our hypothesis
   is further confirmed by density-functional theory calculations, which
   show that the hole states are trapped at Mg vacancies above the valence
   band. Moreover, this localized hole-states model is used to interpret
   electrical transport properties. Both the Seebeck coefficient and
   resistivity of Mg2-delta Si0.4Sn0-6 indicate an electron-hopping
   transport mechanism. In addition, the data suggest that localized
   band-tail states may exist in the conduction-band edge of Mg2SixSn1-x.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{We use inverse methods of statistical mechanics to explore trade-offs
   associated with designing interactions to stabilize self-assembled
   structures against changes in density or temperature. Specifically, we
   find isotropic, convex-repulsive pair potentials that maximize the
   density range for which a two-dimensional square lattice is the stable
   ground state subject to a constraint on the chemical potential advantage
   it exhibits over competing structures (i.e., ``depth{''} of the
   associated minimum on the chemical potential hypersurface). We formulate
   the design problem as a nonlinear program, which we solve numerically.
   This allows us to efficiently find optimized interactions for a wide
   range of possible chemical potential constraints. We find that
   assemblies designed to exhibit a large chemical potential advantage at a
   specified density have a smaller overall range of densities for which
   they are stable. This trend can be understood by considering the
   separation-dependent features of the pair potential and its gradient
   required to enhance the stability of the target structure relative to
   competitors. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we further show that
   potentials designed with larger chemical potential advantages exhibit
   higher melting temperatures. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells have a strong edge to become an inexpensive,
   high-capacity rechargeable battery system. However, currently, several
   prohibitive challenges occur within the sulfur core, especially the
   polysulfide-diffusion problem. To address these scientific issues, we
   present here a boron-doped multiwalled carbon nanotube coated separator
   (B-CNT-coated separator). The B-CNT-coated separator creates a
   polysulfide trap between the pure sulfur cathode and the polymeric
   separator as a ``polysulfide-trapping interface,{''} stabilizing the
   active material and allowing the dissolved polysulfides to activate the
   bulk sulfur cores. Therefore, the dissolved polysulfides change from
   causing fast capacity fade to assisting with the activation of bulk
   sulfur clusters in pure sulfur cathodes. Moreover, the heteroatom-doped
   polysulfide-trapping interface is currently one of the missing pieces of
   carbon-coated separators, which might inspire further studies in its
   effect and battery chemistry. Li-S cells employing B-CNT-coated
   separators (i) exhibit improved cyclability at various cycling rates
   from 0.2C to 1.0C rate and (ii) attain a high capacity retention rate of
   60\% with a low capacity fade rate of 0.04\% cycle(-1) after 500 cycles.
   We believe that our B-CNT-coated separator could light up a new research
   area for integrating heteroatom-doped carbon into the flexible,
   lightweight, carbon-coated separator.}},

Abstract = {{Ribosome-footprint profiling provides genome-wide snapshots of
   translation, but technical challenges can confound its analysis. Here,
   we use improved methods to obtain ribosome-footprint profiles and mRNA
   abundances that more faithfully reflect gene expression in Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae. Our results support proposals that both the beginning of
   coding regions and codons matching rare tRNAs are more slowly
   translated. They also indicate that emergent polypeptides with as few as
   three basic residues within a ten-residue window tend to slow
   translation. With the improved mRNA measurements, the variation
   attributable to translational control in exponentially growing yeast was
   less than previously reported, and most of this variation could be
   predicted with a simple model that considered mRNA abundance, upstream
   open reading frames, cap-proximal structure and nucleotide composition,
   and lengths of the coding and 50 UTRs. Collectively, our results provide
   a framework for executing and interpreting ribosome-profiling studies
   and reveal key features of translational control in yeast.}},

Abstract = {{A significant amount of research is taking place to create energy
   storage concepts beyond the lithium ion battery and to utilize
   alternative ions, such as Na, Ca, or Mg, to name a few. This has been a
   challenge, as materials that work well to store lithium do not
   necessarily function for other ions. Crystalline germanium (Ge)
   represents such an example: Li can be readily inserted and extracted but
   not Na. However, by amorphizing the crystalline Ge nanowires with an
   initial lithiation step, Ge can be readily and reversibly sodiated.
   Here, we examine the sodiation and desodiation processes that occur in
   Ge nanowires using real-time in situ transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM). Amorphous germanium (a-Ge) nanowires exhibit a 300\% expansion in
   volume upon sodiation, which corresponds approximately to Na1.6Ge, which
   indicates a higher than expected capacity to store Na, i.e., compared to
   NaGe. When the nanowires desodiate they form pores. The pores disappear
   when the nanowire is again sodiated. The nanowires retain their
   structural integrity over the course of several cycles. These results
   show that the potential of a-Ge for Na-ion battery applications may have
   been previously underestimated, and, more generally, electrode materials
   that might appear to be inert for one type of ion storage might be
   enabled by preinsertion of other active ions.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the influence of three common stabilizing agents
   (citrate, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), and branched poly(ethylenimine)
   (BPEI)) on the attachment affinity of silver nanoparticles to ceramic
   water filters. Citrate-stabilized silver nano particles were found to
   have the highest attachment affinity (under conditions in which the
   surface potential was of opposite sign to the filter). This work
   demonstrates that the interaction between the electrical double layers
   plays a critical role in the attachment of nanoparticles to flat
   surfaces and, in particular, that predictions of double-layer
   interactions are sensitive to boundary condition assumptions (constant
   charge vs constant potential). The experimental deposition results can
   be explained when using different boundary condition assumptions for
   different stabilizing molecules but not when the same assumption was
   assumed for all three types of particles. The integration of steric
   interactions can also explain the experimental deposition results.
   Particle size was demonstrated to have an effect on the predicted
   deposition for BPEI-stabilized particles but not for PVP.}},

   between monolayer graphene and a rigid substrate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Graphene monolayer, with extremely low flexural stiffness, displays
   spontaneous rippling due to thermal fluctuations at a finite
   temperature. When a graphene membrane is placed on a solid substrate,
   the adhesive interactions between graphene and the substrate could
   considerably suppress thermal rippling. On the other hand, the
   statistical nature of thermal rippling adds an entropic contribution to
   the graphene-substrate interactions. In this paper, we present a
   statistical mechanics analysis on thermal rippling of monolayer graphene
   supported on a rigid substrate, assuming a generic form of van der Waals
   interactions between graphene and substrate at T = 0 K. The rippling
   amplitude, the equilibrium average separation, and the average
   interaction energy are predicted simultaneously and compared with
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the amplitude of thermal
   rippling is reduced by adhesive interactions, the entropic contribution
   leads to an effective repulsion. As a result, the equilibrium average
   separation increases and the effective adhesion energy decreases with
   increasing temperature. Moreover, the effect of a biaxial pre-strain in
   graphene is considered, and a buckling instability is predicted at a
   critical compressive strain that depends on both the temperature and the
   adhesive interactions. Limited by the harmonic approximations, the
   theoretical predictions agree with MD simulations only for relatively
   small rippling amplitudes but can be extended to account for the
   anharmonic effects. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations reveal that the work function of
   Au supported on MgO(001) is substantially reduced because of an
   interfacial dipole moment formed at the Au/MgO interface. Consequently,
   the Au/MgO interface plays an active role in the activation of O-2
   molecules by promoting charge transfer to the O-2 2 pi{*} orbital. The
   presence of F-centers in the MgO substrate can further promote the
   charge transfer and bonding of O-2 at the interface boundary. However,
   O-2 dissociation is kinetically hindered. The system is then able to
   catalyze CO oxidation at low temperature as adsorbed CO and O-2 readily
   react to form CO2 with a low energy barrier.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation optics (TO) has established itself as a powerful and
   versatile approach to the synthesis of metamaterials with prescribed
   field-manipulation capabilities, via suitable spatial modulation of
   their constitutive properties inspired by local distortions of the
   spatial coordinate reference frame. From the mathematical viewpoint,
   this approach can be reformulated in the frequency-wavenumber reciprocal
   phase space so as to engineer nonlocal interactions and spatial
   dispersion effects, which are becoming increasingly relevant in
   electrodynamics and optics. Here, we present a general nonlocal-TO
   framework, based on complex-valued, frequency-dependent wavenumber
   coordinate transformations, and explore its possible applications to
   scenarios of interest for dispersion engineering. A key attribute of our
   approach, similar to conventional TO, is the separation of the
   conceptual design (based on intuitive geometrical considerations) from
   the actual metamaterial synthesis (based on a suitable approximation of
   analytically derived constitutive ``blueprints{''}). To illustrate the
   capabilities and potential of the proposed approach, we address the
   engineering (from the conceptual design to the actual synthesis) of
   multilayered metamaterials exhibiting various exotic dispersion effects,
   including ``one-way{''} (nonreciprocal) propagation, ``frozen-mode{''}
   regime, and Dirac-point conical singularities. Our approach may open up
   new perspectives in the systematic design of metamaterials with broad
   field-manipulation capabilities as well as complex spatiotemporal
   dispersion effects, with potential applications to nonreciprocal optics,
   topological photonics, and ``computational metamaterials.{''} (C) 2016

Abstract = {{An uncertainty analysis methodology is proposed to aid in quantifying
   the risks of thermal comfort under-performance posed by changes to
   variations in physical and operational characteristics of a building and
   its environment. This includes those implemented for building energy
   savings, peak electricity load reductions, or those due to climatic
   changes. Using building performance data as input, a response surface
   methodology is used to develop a model to predict building thermal
   performance for ranges of user-defined design variables. This model is
   verified for accuracy using in- and out-of-sample data. Uncertainly
   analysis is then used to estimate the probability of achieving an
   acceptable threshold of thermal comfort performance. A case study is
   presented to demonstrate the implementation and interpretation of the
   results of this methodology, which evaluates the effects of a 1-h demand
   response event on thermal comfort of a residential
   mechanically-conditioned building. The case study finds that a
   second-order response surface provides a reasonably accurate model of
   thermal comfort. For the studied single family home, compared to varying
   the air exchange rate, the indoor set-point temperature has a greater
   influence on achieving an acceptable level of thermal comfort.}},

Abstract = {{This study involved the development of a model for evaluating the
   potential costs and benefits of ozone control with combined
   particle/activated carbon filtration (referred to here as activated
   carbon filtration) in buildings. The modeling effort included the
   prediction of indoor ozone and ozone reaction products with and without
   activated carbon filtration in the HVAC system. Benefit-to-cost ratios
   were estimated for various types of buildings in 12 American cities in 5
   different climate zones. Health benefits were evaluated using
   disability-adjusted life-years attributed to the difference in indoor
   ozone concentration with and without activated carbon filtration, and
   included city-specific age demographics for each simulation. Costs of
   activated-carbon filters included capital cost differences when compared
   against conventional HVAC filters of similar minimum efficiency
   reporting value rating (e.g., minimum efficiency reporting value 6-8),
   energy penalties due to additional pressure drop, and regional utility
   rates. When assuming a single-pass ozone removal efficiency of 60\%,
   carbon filtration during the ozone season was beneficial and
   economically viable in commercial office buildings, long-term
   health-care facilities, and K-12 schools. Residential activated carbon
   filtration could be economically viable for conditions of higher ozone
   removal efficiencies, lower filter costs, and lower pressure drop across
   the filter.}},

Abstract = {{In subsurface imaging and oil recovery where temperatures and salinities
   are high, it is challenging to design polymer-coated nanoparticles with
   low retention (high mobility) in porous rock. Herein, the grafting of
   poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid-co-acrylic acid)
   (poly(AMPS-co-AA)) on magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles was sufficiently
   uniform to achieve low adsorption on model colloidal silica and crushed
   Berea sandstone in highly concentrated API brine (8\% NaCl and 2\% CaCl2
   by weight). The polymer shell was grafted via amide bonds to an
   aminosilica layer, which was grown on silica-coated magnetite
   nanoparticles. The particles were found to be stable against aggregation
   in American Petroleum Institute (API) brine at 90 degrees C for 24 h.
   For JO nanoparticles with, similar to 23\% polymer content, Langmuir
   adsorption capacities on colloidal silica and crushed Berea Sandstone in
   batch experiments were extremely low at only 0.07 and 0.09 mg of
   10/m(2), respectively. Furthermore, upon injection of a 2.5 mg/mL IO
   suspension in API brine in a column packed with crushed Berea sandstone,
   the dynamic adsorption of IO nanoparticles was only 0.05 +/- 0.01
   mg/m(2), which is consistent with the batch experiment results. The
   uniformity and high concentration of solvated poly(AMPS-co-AA) chains on
   the IO surfaces provided electrosteric stabilization of the nanoparticle
   dispersions and also weakened the interactions of the nanoparticles with
   negatively charged silica and sandstone surfaces despite the very large
   salinities.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-wide oscillations generated in a single unit can negatively affect
   the overall control performance of the process; thus, it is necessary to
   detect them and diagnose their root cause. However, the interference of
   noise and the need for oscillation propagation routes pose more
   challenges for process engineers. In this paper, the concept spectral
   transfer entropy is proposed and its connection to the spectral Granger
   causality is derived. Moreover, an information transfer method
   incorporating spectral envelope algorithm and spectral transfer entropy
   is applied to provide new diagnostic guidance, whose feasibility and
   effectiveness have been demonstrated by both simulated and industrial
   case studies. Compared with current methods, the new procedure enjoys
   the following advantages: (a) performing oscillation detection and
   diagnosis within a targeted frequency range and mitigating the effects
   of measurement noise outside the bandwidth; (b) provides an nominal
   causal map reflecting the oscillation propagation pattern. The root
   cause obtained by the method in the industrial case is further validated
   by a wavelet power spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{A low-order amine scrubbing model was developed for an intercooled
   absorber and advanced flash stripper configuration with piperazine
   solvent. The low-order lumped parameter model uses semi-empirical
   thermodynamics and rate based mass transfer and embeds reaction kinetics
   in a constant overall transfer coefficient. The predicted off-design
   steady state of this model is compared to a high-order Aspen Plus
   simulation for 100-85\% power plant load. The difference in CO2 removal
   rate between the two models is less than 1\% when power plant load is
   greater than 94\%. The removal rate is systematically overpredicted in
   the low-order model because a constant CO2 mass transfer coefficient in
   the absorber leads to an overprediction of absorber performance at
   part-load operation. Compared to pilot plant data, the low-order model
   captures the dynamic response of a step change in the stripper pressure
   control valve. The characteristic time of the total CO2 inventory is
   found to be 77 min, compared to a total liquid residence time of 48 min.
   The low-order model sufficiently represents process behavior and will be
   used in future work to screen regulatory process control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur cathodes have become appealing for rechargeable batteries because
   of their high theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g(-1)). However, the
   conventional cathode configuration borrowed from lithium-ion batteries
   may not allow the pure sulfur cathode to put its unique materials
   chemistry to good use. The
   solid((sulfur))-liquid((polysulfides))-solid((sulfides)) phase
   transitions generate polysulfide intermediates that are soluble in the
   commonly used organic solvents in Li-S cells. The resulting severe
   polysulfide diffusion and the irreversible active-material loss have
   been hampering the development of Li-S batteries for years. The present
   study presents a robust, ultra-tough, flexible cathode with the
   active-material fillings encapsulated between two buckypapers (B),
   designated as buckypaper/sulfur/buckypaper (B/S/B) cathodes, that
   suppresses the irreversible polysulfide diffusion to the anode and
   offers excellent electrochemical reversibility with a low capacity fade
   rate of 0.06\% per cycle after 400 cycles. Engineering enhancements
   demonstrate that the B/S/B cathodes represent a facile approach for the
   development of high-performance sulfur electrodes with a high areal
   capacity of 5.1 mA h cm(-2), which increases further to approach 7 mA h
   cm(-2) on coupling with carbon-coated separators.}},

Title = {{Intramolecular Cleavage of the hASRGL1 Homodimer Occurs in Two Stages}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{960-969}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{The human asparaginase-like protein 1 (hASRGL1) is a member of the
   N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) family that hydrolyzes L-asparagine and
   isoaspartyl-dipeptides. The nascent protein folds into an alpha
   beta-beta alpha sandwich fold homodimer that cleaves its own peptide
   backbone at the G167-T168 bond, resulting in the active form of the
   enzyme. However, biophysical studies of hASRGL1 are difficult because of
   the curious fact that intramolecular cleavage of the G167-T168 peptide
   bond reaches only <50\% completion. We capitalized upon our previous
   observation that intramolecular processing increases thermostability and
   developed a differential scanning fluorimetry assay that allowed direct
   detection of distinct processing intermediates for the first time. A
   kinetic analysis of these intermediates revealed that cleavage of one
   subunit of the hASRGL1 subunit drastically reduces the processing rate
   of the adjacent monomer, and a mutagenesis study showed that
   stabilization of the dimer interface plays a critical role in this
   process. We also report a comprehensive analysis of conserved active
   site residues and delineate their relative roles in autoprocessing and
   substrate hydrolysis. In addition to glycine, which was previously
   reported to selectively accelerate hASRGL1 cleavage, we identified
   several novel small molecule activators that also promote intramolecular
   processing. The structure activity analysis supports the hypothesis that
   multiple negatively charged small molecules interact within the active
   site of hASRGL1 to act as a base in promoting cleavage. Overall, our
   investigation provides a mechanistic understanding of the maturation
   process of this Ntn hydrolase family member.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the vibrational and Raman spectra for Li doped Si
   nanocrystals using real-space pseudopotentials constructed within
   density functional theory. We calculate differences in the Raman spectra
   using the Placzek approximation. The insertion of Li atoms into Si
   nanocrystals disrupts the Si crystal structure forming a region of Li-Si
   alloy in which the regular crystal structure is significantly disrupted.
   The Raman spectrum for this alloy exhibits a Li induced peak at 440-480
   cm(-1). We find an accompanying reduction in the size of the dominant
   bulk-like Si peak at 520 cm(-1). Both of these results are consistent
   with experiment. Our analysis of the calculated spectrum confirms the
   utility of using Raman spectroscopy, coupled with first principle
   computations, to predict the structural and electronic properties of Li
   doped Si nanocrystals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Cascade Lasers}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Terahertz quantum cascade laser sources based on intra-cavity
   difference-frequency generation are currently the only room-temperature
   mass-producible diode-laser-like emitters of coherent 1-6 THz radiation.
   Device performance has improved dramatically over the past few years to
   reach milliwatt-level power output and broad tuning from 1.2 to 5.9 THz,
   all at room-temperature. Terahertz output in these sources originates
   from intersubband optical nonlinearity in the laser active region. Here
   we report the first comprehensive spectroscopic study of the optical
   nonlinearity and investigate its dependence on the mid-infrared pump
   frequencies. Our work shows that the terahertz generation efficiency can
   vary by a factor of 2 or greater depending on the spectral position of
   the mid-infrared pumps for a fixed THz difference-frequency. We have
   also measured for the first time the linewidth for transitions between
   the lower quantum cascade laser states, which is critical for
   determining terahertz nonlinearity and predicting optical loss in
   quantum cascade laser waveguides.}},

   on Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory reference data. Various neutral
   molecular dimers have been tested and results on the complexes of mono-
   and divalent cations with a water ligand are also provided.
   Transferability of the correction is adressed in the context of the
   implementation of the AMOEBA and SIBFA polarizable force fields in the
   TINKER-HP software. As the choices of the multipolar distribution are
   discussed, conclusions are drawn for the future penetration-corrected
   polarizable force fields highlighting the mandatory need of non-spurious
   procedures for the obtention of well balanced and physically meaningful
   distributed moments. Finally, scalability and parallelism of the
   short-range corrected SPME approach are addressed, demonstrating that
   the damping function is computationally affordable and accurate for
   molecular dynamics simulations of complex bio- or bioinorganic systems
   in periodic boundary conditions. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Monodispersed Au nanoparticles were synthesized by the reduction of
   Au-decyltrimethylammonium bromide (Au-DTAB), which was easily prepared
   via the reaction of HAuCl4 and DTAB. This Au-DTAB complex is highly
   stable in air and moisture, and suitable for large-scale synthesis of
   uniform-sized Au nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were characterized by
   transmission electron microscopy, optical absorption spectrometry, X-ray
   diffraction, and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. The size of Au
   nanoparticles was controlled in the range of 5-10 nm by changing the
   concentrations of reducing agent and Au precursor. The resulting Au
   nanoparticles were transferred to the aqueous phase after surface
   engineering using multidentate polymeric ligands with multiple imidazole
   functional groups. Polymeric imidazole ligands (PILs) demonstrated
   enhanced binding stability with the Au surface, and overcame the
   disadvantage of multidentate thiol ligand systems which have oxidative
   cross-linking and the formation of disulfide bonding. The colloidal
   stability of surface engineered Au nanoparticles with PILs was
   investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) characterization. (C)

   attracted the imagination of many researchers in the field as providing

   straightforward simulations are too short to address many interesting

Title = {{A view on coupled cluster perturbation theory using a bivariational
   Lagrangian formulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{We consider two distinct coupled cluster (CC) perturbation series that
   both expand the difference between the energies of the CCSD (CC with
   single and double excitations) and CCSDT (CC with single, double, and
   triple excitations) models in orders of the Moller-Plesset fluctuation
   potential. We initially introduce the E-CCSD(T-n) series, in which the
   CCSD amplitude equations are satisfied at the expansion point, and
   compare it to the recently developed CCSD(T-n) series {[}J. J. Eriksen
   et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108 (2014)], in which not only the CCSD
   amplitude, but also the CCSD multiplier equations are satisfied at the
   expansion point. The computational scaling is similar for the two
   series, and both are term-wise size extensive with a formal convergence
   towards the CCSDT target energy. However, the two series are different,
   and the CCSD(T-n) series is found to exhibit a more rapid convergence up
   through the series, which we trace back to the fact that more
   information at the expansion point is utilized than for the E-CCSD(T-n)
   series. The present analysis can be generalized to any perturbation
   expansion representing the difference between a parent CC model and a
   higher-level target CC model. In general, we demonstrate that, whenever
   the parent parameters depend upon the perturbation operator, a
   perturbation expansion of the CC energy (where only parent amplitudes
   are used) differs from a perturbation expansion of the CC Lagrangian
   (where both parent amplitudes and parent multipliers are used). For the
   latter case, the bivariational Lagrangian formulation becomes more than
   a convenient mathematical tool, since it facilitates a different and
   faster convergent perturbation series than the simpler energy-based
   expansion. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework for the selection of force
   fields in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The framework associates
   the variability of the optimal parameters of the MD potentials under
   different environmental conditions with the corresponding variability in
   experimental data. The high computational cost associated with the
   hierarchical Bayesian framework is reduced by orders of magnitude
   through a parallelized Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method
   combined with the Laplace Asymptotic Approximation. The suitability of
   the hierarchical approach is demonstrated by performing MD simulations
   with prescribed parameters to obtain data for transport coefficients
   under different conditions, which are then used to infer and evaluate
   the parameters of the MD model. We demonstrate the selection of MD
   models based on experimental data and verify that the hierarchical model
   can accurately quantify the uncertainty across experiments; improve the
   posterior probability density function estimation of the parameters,
   thus, improve predictions on future experiments; identify the most
   plausible force field to describe the underlying structure of a given
   dataset. The framework and associated software are applicable to a wide
   range of nanoscale simulations associated with experimental data with a
   hierarchical structure. (C) 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal

Abstract = {{Disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymer membranes are of
   interest for water purification by desalination. These negatively
   charged copolymers exhibit lower fouling and greatly improved resistance
   to oxidants such as chlorinated disinfectants compared to
   state-of-the-art highly cross-linked aromatic polyamide, porous
   polysulfone supported thin film composite (TFC) systems. A systematic
   series of controlled molecular weight 4,4'-biphenol and bisphenol A
   based partially disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)s were
   synthesized with terminal amine functionalities via end-capping with
   m-aminophenol. The stoichiometric balance of the end-capping reagent,
   bisphenols, and two activated dihalides controlled M-n and degree of
   disulfonation. Oligomers with controlled molecular weights and ionic
   content were thermally cross-linked with a multifunctional epoxy resin
   (TGBAM) derived from methylene dianiline. The residual masses from
   boiling solvent extraction confirmed high gel fractions. The networks
   had improved salt rejection compared to linear controls due to reduced
   swelling, and this proved to be a valuable parameter for enhancing
   transport properties. The cross-linked highly sulfonated copolymers
   produced the best water purification properties to date observed for
   disulfonated polysulfone membranes by retaining high salt rejection with
   enhanced water permeabilities. For example, an epoxy-cross-linked
   4,4'-biphenol-based 60\% disulfonated polysulfone with an ion exchange
   capacity (IEC) of 1.85 mequiv/g had a salt rejection of 96.7\% and a
   relatively high hydraulic water permeability of 1.18 (L mu m m(-2) h(-1)
   bar(-1)), compared to a linear 4,4'-biphenol-based 40\% disulfonated
   polysulfone with a similar ionic content (IEC = 1.78) that only had a
   salt rejection of 92.5\% and a hydraulic water permeability of 0.62 (L
   mu m m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)).}},

   Sodium-Sulfur Batteries with a Carbon-Coated Functional Nafion Separator

Abstract = {{Operation of sodium-sulfur batteries at room temperature has been
   proposed and studied for about a decade, but polysulfide-shuttle through
   the traditional battery separator and low-utilization of the sulfur
   cathode commonly have been the major challenges. Also, because of the
   highly active nature of the sodium metal, the conventional room
   temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery concept with the
   sodium-metal anode and elemental sulfur cathode imposes serious safety
   concerns. To overcome the above difficulties, we present here a RT Na-S
   system with an advanced membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) comprising a
   carbon-coated, presodiated Nafion membrane (Na-Nafion) and a sodium
   sulfide (Na2S) cathode. The Na-Nafion membrane provides a facile Na+-ion
   conductive path and serves as a cation-selective shield to prevent the
   migration of the polysulfides to the anode. The carbon coating on the
   Na-Nafion plays an upper-current-collector role and thereby improves the
   electrochemical utilization of the active Na2S. Employing Na2S as the
   cathode provides a pathway to develop the RT Na-S batteries with sodium
   metal-free anodes. The RT Na-S battery with the above MEA exhibits
   remarkably enhanced capacity and cyclability in contrast to the Na-S
   batteries with the conventional electrolyte-separator configuration.
   Mechanistic studies reveal that the suppression of polysulfide migration
   through the Na-Nafion is due to size and electronic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Mediolateral balance control during walking is a challenging task in
   post-stroke hemiparetic individuals. To detect and treat dynamic balance
   disorders, it is important to assess balance using reliable methods. The
   Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), margin-of-stability
   (MoS), and peak-to-peak range of angular-momentum (H) are some of the
   most commonly used measures to assess dynamic balance and fall risk in
   clinical and laboratory settings. However, it is not clear if these
   measures lead to similar conclusions. Thus, the purpose of this study
   was to assess dynamic balance in post-stroke hemiparetic individuals
   using BBS, DGI, MoS and the range of H and determine if these measure
   are correlated. BBS and DGI were collected from 19 individuals
   post-stroke. Additionally, kinematic and kinetic data were collected
   while the same individuals walked at their self-selected speed. MoS and
   the range of H were calculated in the mediolateral direction for each
   participant. Correlation analyses revealed moderate associations between
   all measures. Overall, a higher range of angular-momentum was associated
   with a higher MoS, wider step width and lower BBS and DGI scores,
   indicating poor balance control. Further, only the MoS from the paretic
   foot placement, but not the nonparetic foot, correlated with the other
   balance measures. Although moderate correlations existed between all the
   balance measures, these findings do not necessarily advocate the use of
   a single measure as each test may assess different constructs of dynamic
   balance. These findings have important implications for the use and
   interpretation of dynamic balance assessments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A novel fibre-ensemble level constitutive model for exogenous
   cross-linked collagenous tissues}},
Journal = {{INTERFACE FOCUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Exogenous cross-linking of soft collagenous tissues is a common method
   for biomaterial development and medical therapies. To enable improved
   applications through computational methods, physically realistic
   constitutive models are required. Yet, despite decades of research,
   development and clinical use, no such model exists. In this study, we
   develop the first rigorous full structural model (i.e. explicitly
   incorporating various features of the collagen fibre architecture) for
   exogenously cross-linked soft tissues. This was made possible, in-part,
   with the use of native to cross-linked matched experimental datasets and
   an extension to the collagenous structural constitutive model so that
   the uncross-linked collagen fibre responses could be mapped to the
   cross-linked configuration. This allowed us to separate the effects of
   cross-linking from kinematic changes induced in the cross-linking
   process, which in turn allowed the non-fibrous tissue matrix component
   and the interaction effects to be identified. It was determined that the
   matrix could be modelled as an isotropic material using a modified Yeoh
   model. The most novel findings of this study were that: (i) the
   effective collagen fibre modulus was unaffected by cross-linking and
   (ii) fibre-ensemble interactions played a large role in stress
   development, often dominating the total tissue response (depending on
   the stress component and loading path considered). An important utility
   of the present model is its ability to separate the effects of exogenous
   cross-linking on the fibres from changes due to the matrix. Applications
   of this approach include the utilization in the design of novel chemical
   treatments to produce specific mechanical responses and the study of
   fatigue damage in bioprosthetic heart valve biomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Transition-metal oxides are a promising class of semiconductors for the
   oxidation of water, a process that underpins both photoelectrochemical
   water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. However, these materials
   are limited by very slow charge transport. This is because, unlike
   conventional semiconductors, material aspects of metal oxides favor the
   formation of slow-moving, self-trapped charge carriers: small polarons.
   In this Perspective, we seek to highlight the salient features of
   small-polaron transport in metal oxides, offer guidelines for their
   experimental characterization, and examine recent transport studies of
   two prototypical oxide photoanodes: tungsten-doped monoclinic bismuth
   vanadate (W:BiVO4) and titanium-doped hematite (Ti:alpha-Fe2O3).
   Analysis shows that conduction in both materials is well-described by
   the adiabatic small-polaron model, with electron drift mobility
   (distinct from the Hall mobility) values on the order of 10(-4) and
   10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) respectively. Future directions to build a full
   picture of charge transport in this family of materials are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The self-assembly of citrate-capped Au nanoparticles (S nm) resulted in
   branched nanochains by adding CaCl2 versus spherical nanoclusters for
   NaCl. These assemblies were formed between 1 s to 30 min by tuning the
   electrostatic repulsion and the interparticle bridging attraction
   between the cations and citrate ligands as a function of electrolyte
   concentration. For dilute Ca2+, strong interparticle bridging favored
   particle attachment at chain ends. This resulted in the formation of
   small, branched chains with lengths as short as 20 nm, due to the large
   Debye length for the diffuse counterions. Furthermore, the bridging
   produced very small interparticle spacings and sintering, as evident in
   high resolution TEM despite the low temperature. This morphology
   produced a large red shift in the surface plasmon resonance, as
   characterized by a broad extinction peak with NIR absorption out to 1000
   nm, which is unusual for such small particles. Whereas these properties
   were seen for primary particles with partial citrate monolayers, the
   degrees of sintering and NIR extinction were small in the case of
   citrate multilayers. The ability to design the size and shape of
   nanoparticle clusters as well as the interparticle spacing by tuning
   bridging and electrostatic interactions may be expected to be quite
   general and of broad applicability in materials synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{High expression of the forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) transcription factor
   distinguishes the aggressive activated B cell (ABC) diffuse large B-cell

   A genetic or functional role for FOXP1 in lymphomagenesis, however,
   remains unknown. Here, we report that sustained FOXP1 expression is
   vital for ABC-DLBCL cell-line survival. Genome-wide analyses revealed
   direct and indirect FOXP1 transcriptional enforcement of ABC-DLBCL
   hallmarks, including the classical NF-kappa B and MYD88 (myeloid
   differentiation primary response gene 88) pathways. FOXP1 promoted gene
   expression underlying transition of the GCB cell to the plasmablast-the
   transient B-cell stage targeted in ABC-DLBCL transformation-by
   antagonizing pathways distinctive of GCB-DLBCL, including that of the
   GCB ``master regulator,{''} BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6). Cell-line derived
   FOXP1 target genes that were highly correlated with FOXP1 expression in
   primary DLBCL accurately segregated the corresponding clinical subtypes
   of a large cohort of primary DLBCL isolates and identified conserved
   pathways associated with ABC-DLBCL pathology.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that desktop 3D printers can emit large
   numbers of ultrafine particles (UFPs, particles less than 100 nm) and
   some hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during printing,
   although very few filament and 3D printer combinations have been tested
   to date. Here we quantify emissions of UFPs and speciated VOCs from five
   commercially available filament extrusion desktop 3D printers utilizing
   up to nine different filaments by controlled experiments in a test
   chamber. Median estimates of time-varying UFP emission rates ranged from
   similar to 10(8) to similar to 10(11) min(-1) across all tested
   combinations, varying primarily by filament material and, to a lesser
   extent, bed temperature. The individual VOCs emitted in the largest
   quantities included caprolactam from nylon-based and imitation wood and
   brick filaments (ranging from similar to 2 to similar to 180 mu g/min),
   styrene from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and high-impact
   polystyrene (HIPS) filaments (ranging from similar to 10 to similar to
   110 mu g/min), and lactide from polylactic acid (PLA) filaments (ranging
   from similar to 4 to similar to 5 mu g/min). Results from a screening
   analysis of potential exposure to these products in a typical small
   office environment suggest caution should be used when operating many of
   the printer and filament combinations in poorly ventilated spaces or
   without the aid of combined gas and particle filtration systems.}},

Abstract = {{The time-averaged shear (S) wave velocity in the upper 30 meters of
   sediment (V-S30) is a widely used site parameter for ground motion
   prediction. When unavailable from measurements, as is often the case at
   accelerograph stations in Central and Eastern North America (CENA),
   V-S30 is typically estimated from proxies. We propose an alternative for
   CENA based on a theoretical relationship between S-wave velocity and the
   ratio of radial to vertical components of the compressional
   (P)-wave-dominated portion of the velocity time series. This method is
   applied to 31 CENA accelerograph sites having measured S-wave velocity
   profiles. Time-averaged S-wave velocities to depth z (V-SZ) from the
   proposed method agree well with those from measurements. We develop
   linear relationships between V-SZ and V-S30 using CENA S-wave velocity
   profile data. Values of V-S30 established from the proposed method
   (including depth extrapolation) have lower dispersion relative to data
   (sigma(ln) (V) = 0.43) than do estimates from available CENA proxies.}},

Title = {{Removal of Dissolved Copper and Zinc from Highway Runoff via Adsorption}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved copper and zinc are commonly observed in highway runoff at
   concentrations that have been shown to exert toxic effects on aquatic
   microbiota and macrobiota. Dissolved copper in particular has been shown
   to disrupt the olfactory nervous system of salmon species at
   concentrations as low as 3 mu g/L. To reduce concentrations to below
   this threshold, treatment of highway runoff for the removal of copper
   and zinc is necessary. This study developed a column testing protocol
   that can be used to quickly and reliably evaluate adsorptive removal of
   dissolved heavy metals from highway runoff. The protocol is demonstrated
   in an evaluation of iron oxide, manganese oxide, crab shell, concrete,
   and bone meal media for removing dissolved copper and zinc as a function
   of runoff characteristics, including pH, ionic strength, alkalinity, and
   total organic carbon. The results indicate that iron oxide media in
   combination with crab shell or concrete media is the most effective
   adsorptive technique for the removal of copper and zinc from highway
   runoff, and confirm the efficacy of the proposed protocol. (C) 2015

Title = {{Stereoscopic 3D Visual Discomfort Prediction: A Dynamic Accommodation

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The human visual system perceives 3D depth following sensing via its
   binocular optical system, a series of massively parallel processing
   units, and a feedback system that controls the mechanical dynamics of
   eye movements and the crystalline lens. The process of accommodation
   (focusing of the crystalline lens) and binocular vergence is controlled
   simultaneously and symbiotically via cross-coupled communication between
   the two critical depth computation modalities. The output responses of
   these two subsystems, which are induced by oculomotor control, are used
   in the computation of a clear and stable cyclopean 3D image from the
   input stimuli. These subsystems operate in smooth synchronicity when one
   is viewing the natural world; however, conflicting responses can occur
   when viewing stereoscopic 3D (S3D) content on fixed displays, causing
   physiological discomfort. If such occurrences could be predicted, then
   they might also be avoided (by modifying the acquisition process) or
   ameliorated (by changing the relative scene depth). Toward this end, we
   have developed a dynamic accommodation and vergence interaction (DAVI)
   model that successfully predicts visual discomfort on S3D images. The
   DAVI model is based on the phasic and reflex responses of the fast
   fusional vergence mechanism. Quantitative models of accommodation and
   vergence mismatches are used to conduct visual discomfort prediction.
   Other 3D perceptual elements are included in the proposed method,
   including sharpness limits imposed by the depth of focus and fusion
   limits implied by Panum's fusional area. The DAVI predictor is created
   by training a support vector machine on features derived from the
   proposed model and on recorded subjective assessment results. The
   experimental results are shown to produce accurate predictions of
   experienced visual discomfort.}},

Abstract = {{Westernization has propelled changes in urbanization and architecture,
   altering our exposure to the outdoor environment from that experienced
   during most of human evolution. These changes might affect the
   developmental exposure of infants to bacteria, immune development, and
   human microbiome diversity. Contemporary urban humans spend most of
   their time indoors, and little is known about the microbes associated
   with different designs of the built environment and their interaction
   with the human immune system. This study addresses the associations
   between architectural design and the microbial biogeography of
   households across a gradient of urbanization in South America.
   Urbanization was associated with households' increased isolation from
   outdoor environments, with additional indoor space isolation by walls.
   Microbes from house walls and floors segregate by location, and urban
   indoor walls contain human bacterial markers of space use. Urbanized
   spaces uniquely increase the content of human-associated microbes-which
   could increase transmission of potential pathogens- and decrease
   exposure to the environmental microbes with which humans have coevolved.}},

Title = {{Upper Jurassic Tithonian-centered source mapping in the deepwater

Abstract = {{Long the subject of speculation, the origin, distribution, and quality
   of Mesozoic source beds in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) are now
   open to analytical study and hypothesis. We have developed new maps and
   concepts for organic richness and lithofacies patterns of the primary
   Upper Jurassic oil-prone source rock interval spanning the Kimmeridgian
   to Lower Berriasian in the northern GOM. This interval, previously
   referred to as the Tithonian-centered source, includes the Haynesville
   and Bossier shales, which lie within supersequences representing
   second-order transgressive and high-stand systems tracts, respectively.
   A newly developed gulf-wide Cotton Valley-Bossier paleogeographic map
   based on a novel paleotectonic model for the Mesozoic provides the
   framework for this source mapping study. Organic richness averages up to
   4.7\% and 6.5\% total organic carbon for the Kimmeridgian and
   Tithonian-Lower Berriasian supersequences, respectively, based on the
   log overlay Delta log R technique and increases toward the basin center.
   Lithofacies-sensitive geochemical parameters from reservoired oils and
   oil seeps tied to the Tithonian-centered oil family demonstrate several
   potential entry locations for siliciclastic sediments into the Tithonian
   distal calcareous environment. The region from Garden Banks to Alaminos
   Canyon appears to be the locus of siliciclastic mixing with carbonates
   in the deepwater and link with updip evidence of a wide progradational
   clastic apron sourced by the paleo-Mississippi river. This siliciclastic
   input may contribute to the potential for improved oil quality by
   lowering the content of sulfur incorporated into kerogen moving
   southwest from Ewing Bank-Mississippi Canyon to Alaminos Canyon.
   Ultimately, enhanced Upper Jurassic source deposition ended with a
   ventilation event whereby more oxygenated, deeper water entered the
   northern GOM. Declines in calculated total organic carbon occurring
   later to the west during the earliest Cretaceous (Berriasian) indicate
   the opening of the gateway between the GOM and the central Atlantic
   possibly related to the termination of seafloor spreading in the eastern
   GOM.}},

   penetrate sediments of Last Interglacial (X zone) age. Overall,
   sedimentation rates average approximately 13 cm for the Holocene, but
   they range up to 600 cm. Redeposited sediments (mass-transport deposits
   and/or turbidites) occur in cores from the Rio Grande Submarine Fan, the
   East Breaks Slide Complex, the Trinity-Brazos Turbidite System, and the
   Bryant Canyon Turbidite System. Stratigraphic zonation of suites of

Abstract = {{An exact formulation for the evolution of the probability density
   function of the time derivative of a waveform (slope density)
   propagating according to the one-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation
   is given. The formulation relies on the implicit Earnshaw solution and
   therefore is only valid prior to shock formation. As explicit examples,
   the slope density evolution of an initially sinusoidal plane wave,
   initially Gaussian-distributed planar noise, and an initially triangular
   wave are presented. The triangular wave is used to examine weak-shock
   limits without violating the theoretical assumptions. It is also shown
   that the moments of the slope density function as a function of distance
   may be written as an expansion in terms of the moments of the source
   slope density function. From this expansion, approximate expressions are
   presented for the above cases as well as a specific non-Gaussian noise
   case intended to mimic features of jet noise. Finally, analytical
   predictions of the propagation of initially Gaussian-distributed noise
   are compared favorably with plane-wave tube measurements. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Mechanistic simulation of alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding
   considers chemical reactions between the alkali and the oil to form
   in-situ soap and reactions between the alkali and the minerals and
   brine. A comprehensive mechanistic modeling of such process remains a
   challenge, mainly caused by the complicated ASP phase behavior and the
   complexity of geochemical reactions that occur in the reservoir. Because
   of the lack of the microemulsion phase and/or lack of reactions that may
   lead to the consumption of alkali and resulting lag in the pH, a
   simplified ASP phase behavior is often used.
   A state-of-the-art geochemical package, IPhreeqc, of the United States
   Geological Survey was coupled with UTCHEM, an in-house research
   chemical-flooding reservoir simulator developed at The University of
   Texas at Austin (UT), for a robust, flexible, and accurate integrated
   tool to mechanistically model ASP floods. UTCHEM has a comprehensive
   three-phase (water, oil, microemulsion) flash package for the mixture of
   surfactant and soap as a function of salinity, temperature, and
   cosolvent concentration.
   Through this integrated tool, we are able to simulate homogeneous and
   heterogeneous (mineral dissolution/precipitation), irreversible, surface
   complexation, and ion exchange reactions under nonisothermal,
   nonisobaric, and both local-equilibrium and kinetic conditions. Italic
   words are defined in Appendix A. IPhreeqc has rich databases of chemical
   species and also the flexibility to include the alkaline reactions
   required for modeling ASP floods. Hence, to the best of our knowledge,
   for the first time, the important aspects of ASP flooding are
   considered.
   An algorithm is presented for modeling the geochemistry in an
   implicit-in-pressure-and-explicit-in-concentration solution algorithm.
   Finally, we show how to apply the integrated tool, UTCHEM-IPhreeqc, to
   match three different reaction-related chemical-flooding processes: ASP
   flooding in an acidic active crude oil, ASP flooding in a nonacidic
   crude oil, and alkaline/cosolvent/polymer flooding.}},

Abstract = {{The interest in modeling geochemical reactions has increased
   significantly for different improved-oil-recovery processes such as
   alkali/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flood, low-salinity waterflood, and
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) injection as a sacrificial agent
   in hard brine. Numerical simulation of multiphase flow coupled with
   geochemical reactions is challenging because of complex and coupled
   aqueous, aqueous/solid, and aqueous/oleic reactions. These reactions
   have significant impact upon oil recovery, and hence a robust
   geochemical simulator is important.
   UTCHEM (2000) is a chemical-flooding reservoir simulator with
   geochemical-modeling capability. Nevertheless, one major limitation in
   the geochemical-reactive engine of UTCHEM is assuming the activities of
   reactive species is equal to unity. In fact, the activity coefficients
   are strongly nonlinear functions of the ionic strength of solution. One
   approach to tackle this deficiency was to couple UTCHEM (flow and
   transport) with IPhreeqc (a geochemical reactive engine) (Kazemi Nia
   Korrani et al. 2013). However, the simulator proved to be
   computationally expensive. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the
   geochemical-reactive engine within UTCHEM.
   This paper presents the improvement of the geochemical-reactive engine
   in UTCHEM including implementing different activity- coefficient models
   for different reactive species, cation-exchange reactions, and numerical
   convergence. Certain unknown concentrations are eliminated from the
   elemental mass-balance equations and the reaction equations to reduce
   the computational burden. The Jacobian matrix and right-hand side of the
   linear-system equation in the Newton-Raphson method are updated
   accordingly in the Newton-Raphson method for performing the
   batchreaction calculation.
   A low-salinity-waterflood case is presented to validate the updated
   UTCHEM against PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo 1999) and UTCHEM-IPhreeqc.
   The simulation studies indicated that the updated geochemical simulator
   succeeds in tackling the inaccuracy concerned in the original UTCHEM.
   Also, the updated version is more efficient compared with PHREEQC and
   UTCHEM-IPhreeqc with the same degree of accuracy. The updated
   geochemical simulator is then applied to model an ASP coreflood in which
   EDTA is used as a sacrificial agent to chelate calcium and magnesium
   ions. The experimental data of pH, oil recovery, and pressure drop were
   successfully history matched with predictions of the effluent
   concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. A synthetic 3D ASP pilot
   case is successfully simulated considering effects of acid equilibrium
   reaction constant on oil recovery.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid process is developed and optimized for heavy-oil recovery that
   combines moderate reservoir heating and chemical enhanced oil recovery
   in the form of alkali/cosolvent/polymer flood. The process is simulated
   by use of a model derived from existing laboratory and pilot data of a
   5,000-cp heavy-oil field. It is found that hot waterflooding is
   efficient in heating the reservoir only when high early injectivity is
   achievable. This may not be the case if incipient fluid injectivity is
   low and/or long, continuous, horizontal shale baffles are present. To
   remedy the former, an electrical-preheating period is devised, whereas
   switching to a horizontal flood could overcome the latter. Once the
   reservoir temperature is raised sufficiently, a moderately unstable
   alkali/cosolvent/polymer flood is capable of mobilizing and displacing
   oil. A best combined strategy for efficient reservoir heating, high oil
   recovery, and cost effectiveness is found to involve reducing the oil
   viscosity to values of approximately 300-500 cp and combining a degree
   of mobility control and low interfacial tension as recovery mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In the electrical-Joule-heating process, the reservoirs are heated in
   situ by dissipation of electrical energy to reduce the viscosity of oil.
   In principle, electrical current passes through the reservoir fluids
   mostly because of the electrical conductivity of saturated fluids such
   as saline water. The flow of electrical current through the reservoir
   raises the heat in the reservoir and thereby dramatically reduces the
   oil viscosity.
   In this process, electrical current can flow between electricalpotential
   sources (electrodes) in wells, and then electrical energy is dissipated
   to generate the heat. Therefore, the regions around the electrodes in
   (or around) the wells are extremely heated. Because the wells act as
   line sources for the electrical potential, greater heating takes place
   near the wellbore, causing possible vaporization of water in that
   region. Because steam has very-low electrical conductivity, it can
   reduce the efficiency of this process significantly. In this process
   electrical conductivity plays a very important role. To increase
   efficiency of this type of heating process, the presence of optimum
   saline-water saturation is an essential factor.
   To model the electrical Joule heating in the presence of multiphase-
   fluid flow, we use three Maxwell classical electromagnetism equations.
   These equations are simplified and assumed for low frequency to obtain
   the conservation of the electrical-current equation and Ohm's law. The
   conservation of electrical current and Ohm's law are implemented by use
   of a finite-difference method in a four-phase chemical-flooding
   reservoir simulator (UTCHEM 2011.7). The Joule-heating rate caused by
   dissipation of electrical energy is calculated and added to the energy
   equation as a source term.
   The formulation and implementation of electrical heating are validated
   against a reference analytical solution and verified with a reservoir
   simulator. A typical-reservoir model is built, and constant electrical
   potential with alternating current is applied to the model to study the
   efficiency of the electrical-heating process properly. The efficiency of
   this process is evaluated in the presence of water-saturated fractures
   and evaporation effect. Results illustrate that water saturation in the
   presence of fractures and electrical conductivity of saturated rock have
   an important effect on the Joule-heating process. The importance of the
   fractures saturated by saline water and operation of such processes
   below the boiling point are key findings in this paper to obtain high
   recovery in comparison with other conventional-thermal-recovery methods.}},

Abstract = {{Imbibition of surfactant solution into the oil-wet matrix in fractured
   reservoirs is a complicated process that involves gravity, capillary,
   viscous, and diffusive forces. The standard experiment for testing
   imbibition of surfactant solution involves an imbibition cell, in which
   the core is placed in the surfactant solution and the recovery is
   measured vs. time. Although these experiments prove the effectiveness of
   surfactants, little insight into the physics of the problem is achieved.
   In this study, we performed water and surfactant flooding into oil-wet
   fractured cores and monitored the imbibition of the surfactant solution
   by use of computed-tomography (CT) scanning. From the CT images, the
   surfactant-imbibition dynamics as a function of height along the core
   was obtained. Although the waterflood only displaced oil from the
   fracture, the surfactant solution imbibed into the matrix; the
   imbibition is frontal, with the greatest imbibition rate at the bottom
   of the core, and the imbibition decreases roughly linearly with height.
   Experiments with cores of different sizes showed that increase in either
   the height or the diameter of the core causes decrease in imbibition and
   fractional oil-recovery rate. We also perform numerical simulations to
   model the observed imbibition.
   On the basis of the experimental measurements and numerical- simulation
   results, we propose a new scaling group that includes both the diameter
   and the height of the core. We show that the new scaling groups scale
   the recovery curves better than the traditional scaling group.}},

Abstract = {{Foams for subsurface applications are traditionally stabilized by
   surfactants. The goal of this work is to study foam stabilization by
   nanoparticles-in particular, by in-situ surface-hydrophobization of
   hydrophilic nanoparticles. The interfacial properties of the
   nanoparticles were modulated by the attachment of short-chain surface
   modifiers (alkyl gallates) that render them partially hydrophobic, but
   still fully dispersible in water. First, static foams were generated
   with nanoparticles with varying concentrations of surface modifiers. The
   decay of foam height with time was measured, and half-lives were
   determined. Optical micrographs of foam stabilized by surface-modified
   nanoparticles (SMNPs) and surfactant were recorded. Second, aqueous
   foams were created insitu by coinjecting the SMNP solutions with
   nitrogen gas through a Berea sandstone core at a fixed quality. Pressure
   drop across the core was measured to estimate the achieved resistance
   factor. These pressure-drop results were then compared with those of a
   typical surfactant (alpha olefin sulfonate, alkyl polyglucoside) under
   similar conditions. Finally, oil-displacement experiments were conducted
   in Berea cores with surfactant and SMNP solutions as foaming agents
   (coinjection with nitrogen gas). A Bartsch shake test revealed the
   strong foaming tendency of SMNPs even with a very low initial
   surface-modifier concentration (0.05 wt\%), whereas hydrophilic
   nanoparticles alone could not stabilize foam. The bubble texture of foam
   stabilized by SMNPs was finer than that with surfactants, indicating a
   stronger foam. As the degree of surface coating increased, the
   resistance factor of SMNP foam in a Berea core increased significantly.
   The corefloods in the sandstone cores with a reservoir crude oil showed
   that immiscible foams with SMNP solution can recover a significant
   amount of oil (20.6\% of original oil in place) over waterfloods.}},

Abstract = {{The prevailing approach for hydraulic-fracture modeling relies on
   linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). Generally, LEFM that uses
   stress-intensity factor at the fracture tip gives reasonable predictions
   for hard-rock hydraulic-fracturing processes, but often fails to give
   accurate predictions of fracture geometry and propagation pressure in
   formations that can undergo plastic failures, such as poorly
   consolidated/unconsolidated sands and ductile shales. This is because
   the fracture-process zone ahead of the crack tip, elasto-plastic
   material behavior, and strong coupling between flow and stress cannot be
   neglected in these formations. Recent laboratory testing has revealed
   that in many cases, fracture-propagation conditions cannot be described
   by traditional LEFM models. Rather, fractures develop in cohesive zones.
   In this study, we developed a fully coupled poro-elasto-plastic
   hydraulic-fracturing model by combining the cohesive-zone method with
   the Mohr-Coulomb theory of plasticity, which not only can model fracture
   initiation and growth while considering process-zone effects, but also
   can capture the effects of plastic deformation in the bulk formation.
   The impact of the formation plastic properties on the fracture process
   is investigated, and the results are compared with existing models. In
   addition, the effects of different parameters on fracture propagation in
   ductile formations are also investigated through parametric study. The
   results indicate that plastic and highly deforming formations exhibit
   greater breakdown and propagation pressure. The more plastic the
   formation (lower cohesion strength), the higher the net pressure
   required to propagate the fracture. Also, lower cohesion strength leads
   to shorter and wider fracture geometry. The effect of formation
   plasticity on a hydraulic fracture is mostly controlled by initial
   stress contrast, cohesion strength of formation rock, and pore pressure.
   We also found that altering the effective fracture toughness can only
   partially mimic the consequences of increased toughness ahead of the
   fracture tip in ductile formations, but it fails to capture the effect
   of shear failure within the entire affected area, which can lead to
   underestimating the fracture width and overestimating the fracture
   length. For a more-accurate-modeling of fracturing in ductile
   formations, the entire plastic-deformation region induced by the
   propagating fracture should be considered, especially when shear-failure
   areas are large.}},

Abstract = {{Production data from most fractured horizontal wells in gas and
   liquid-rich unconventional reservoirs plot as straight lines with a
   one-half slope on a log-log plot of rate vs. time. This production
   signature (half-slope) is identical to that expected from a 1D linear
   flow from reservoir matrix to the fracture face, when production occurs
   at constant bottomhole pressure. In addition, microseismic data obtained
   around these fractured wells suggest that an area of enhanced
   permeability is developed around the horizontal well, and outside this
   region is an undisturbed part of the reservoir with low permeability. On
   the basis of these observations, geoscientists have, in general, adopted
   the conceptual double-porosity model in modeling production from
   fractured horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs. The analytical
   solution to this mathematical model exists in Laplace space, but it
   cannot be inverted back to real-time space without use of a numerical
   inversion algorithm. We present a new approximate analytical solution to
   the double-porosity model in real-time space and its use in modeling and
   forecasting production from unconventional oil reservoirs.
   The first step in developing the approximate solution was to convert the
   systems of partial-differential equations (PDEs) for the double-porosity
   model into a system of ordinary-differential equations (ODEs). After
   which, we developed a function that gives the relationship between the
   average pressures in the high- and the low-permeability regions. With
   this relationship, the system of ODEs was solved and used to obtain a
   rate/time function that one can use to predict oil production from
   unconventional reservoirs. The approximate solution was validated with
   numerical reservoir simulation.
   We then performed a sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to
   understand how the model behaves. After the model was validated and
   tested, we applied it to field-production data by partially history
   matching and forecasting the expected ultimate recovery (EUR). The
   rate/time function fits production data and also yields realistic
   estimates of ultimate oil recovery. We also investigated the existence
   of any correlation between the model-derived parameters and available
   reservoir and well-completion parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements are considered among the
   most-reliable methods to evaluate porosity and pore-size distribution in
   fluid-bearing rocks. However, in reservoirs with complex pore geometry,
   there is still a challenge to interpret accurately NMR relaxometry data
   to evaluate petrophysical properties of these reservoirs such as
   interconnected porosity. In this paper, we introduce the application of
   nanoparticle contrast agents to improve assessment of interconnected
   porosity with NMR measurements. The comparison of NMR relaxometry data
   before and after nanoparticle injection enables distinguishing connected
   and isolated pore volumes (PVs), which might not be possible in the
   absence of contrast agents. The use of these contrast agents was
   demonstrated successfully in the magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI)
   technique for clinical diagnosis.
   We used superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) as contrast
   agents injected into rock samples with a multiple-porosity system
   (including intra-/intergranular pores and natural fractures) and then
   quantified their impact on NMR measurements with laboratory experiments
   and numerical simulations. We injected contrast agents in sandstone and
   organic-rich mudrock samples, and measured NMR T-2 (spin-spin relaxation
   time) distributions before and after contrast-agent injection. We
   simulated the NMR responses in sandstone and organic-rich mudrock
   samples before and after injection of contrast agent with a random-walk
   algorithm. The simulated NMR T-2 distribution was cross validated by
   experimental results. We also documented the simulation results in a
   carbonates sample before and after injection of contrast agents, and
   characterized the pore-network connectivity with the simulation T-2
   distribution.
   The results show that the comparison of NMR relaxometry data before and
   after SPION injection improves characterization of interconnected
   porosity and connectivity of natural fractures in rock samples with
   complex pore geometry such as those from carbonate and organic-rich
   mudrock formations. We observed that the long-relaxation-time peaks in
   NMR T-2 distribution significantly shift to short relaxation time after
   SPION injection, indicating that interconnected large pores/fractures
   are most easily invaded by SPION. However, the original
   short-relaxation-time peaks remained at the same position with almost
   the same amplitude and shape, indicating that small pores are not
   invaded by SPION. The accumulative porosity of the rock remains almost
   the same before and after SPION injection, indicating that SPION
   invasion in the rock only results in the downshifting of T-2 relaxation
   time, but does not affect the NMR estimates of total porosity. We
   conclude from the experimental and numerical-simulation results that
   interconnected large pores/fractures, isolated large pores, and small
   pores can be differentiated in NMR T-2 distribution with the aid of
   contrast agents. The outcomes of this paper are promising for the
   successful application of the introduced technique for pore
   characterization in heterogeneous multiple-porosity systems containing
   natural fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Low-salinity waterflooding is an emerging enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR)
   technique in which the salinity of the injected water is substantially
   reduced to improve oil recovery over conventional higher-salinity
   waterflooding. Although there are many low-salinity experimental results
   reported in the literature, publications on modeling this process are
   rare. Although there remains some debate regarding the mechanisms of low
   salinity waterflooding process (LoSal EOR (R)){*}, the geochemical
   reactions that control the wetting of crude oil on the rock are likely
   to be central to a detailed description of the process. Because no
   comprehensive geochemical-based modeling has been applied in this area,
   it was decided to couple a state-of-the-art geochemical package,
   IPhreeqc (Charlton and Parkhurst 2011), developed by the US Geological
   Survey, with UTCOMP (Chang 1990), the compositional reservoir simulator
   developed by The University of Texas at Austin.
   A step-by-step algorithm is presented for integrating IPhreeqc with
   UTCOMP. Through this coupling, we are able to simulate homogeneous and
   heterogeneous (mineral dissolution/precipitation), irreversible, and
   ion-exchange reactions under nonisothermal, nonisobaric, and both
   local-equilibrium (away from the wellbore) and kinetic (near wellbore)
   conditions. Consistent with the literature, there are significant
   effects of water-soluble hydrocarbon components-e.g., carbon dioxide
   (CO2), methane (CH4), and acidic/basic components of the crude-on
   buffering the aqueous pH value and more generally, on the crude oil,
   brine, and rock reactions. Thermodynamic constraints are used to
   explicitly include the effect of these water-soluble hydrocarbon
   components. Hence, this combines the geochemical power of IPhreeqc with
   the important aspects of hydrocarbon flow and compositional effects to
   produce a robust, flexible, and accurate integrated tool capable of
   including the reactions needed to mechanistically model low-salinity
   waterflooding.
   Different geochemical-based approaches to modeling wettability change in
   sandstones (e.g., interpolation on the basis of total ionic strength and
   multicomponent ion exchange through surface complexation of the
   organometallic components) were implemented in UTCOMP-IPhreeqc, and the
   integrated tool is then used to match and interpret a low-salinity
   experiment published by Kozaki (2012) and the field trial performed by
   BP at the Endicott field.}},

Abstract = {{Epitaxial heterostructures of gamma - Al2O3/SrTiO3, grown by atomic
   layer deposition (ALD) and molecular beam epitaxy, have been
   characterized by advanced electron microscopy techniques, including

   two-dimensional spectrum maps from samples that previously showed highly
   conductive interfacial layers revealed partial reduction of the Ti
   oxidation state in the SrTiO3 layer from Ti4+ to Ti3+, which was
   confined to within similar to 1-2 unit cells of the interface. Electron
   holography of an ALD-grown sample revealed a phase profile within the
   SrTiO3 layer that rose sharply over a distance of about 1 nm moving away
   from the interface. Taken together, these results suggest a strong

Abstract = {{A numerical modeling framework is described that is able to calculate
   the coupled processes of fluid flow, geomechanics, and rock failure for
   application to general engineering problems related to reservoir
   stimulation, including hydraulic fracturing and shear stimulation. The
   numerical formulation employs the use of an embedded fracture modeling
   approach, which provides several advantages over more traditional
   methods in terms of computational complexity and efficiency.
   Specifically, the embedded fracture modeling strategy avoids the usual
   requirement that the discretization of the fracture domain conforms to
   the discretization of the rock volume surrounding the fractures. As
   fluid is exchanged between the two domains, conservation of mass is
   guaranteed through a coupling term that appears as a simple source term
   in the governing mass balance equations. In this manner, as new tensile
   fractures nucleate and propagate subject to mechanical effects,
   numerical complexities associated with the introduction of new fracture
   control volumes are largely negated. In addition, the ability to
   discretize the fractures and surrounding rock volume independently
   provides the freedom to choose an acceptable level of discretization for
   each domain separately. Three numerical examples were performed to
   demonstrate the utility of the embedded fracture model for application
   to problems involving fluid flow, mechanical deformation, and rock
   failure. The results of the numerical examples confirm that the embedded
   fracture model was able to capture accurately the complex and nonlinear
   evolution of reservoir permeability as new fractures propagate through
   the reservoir and as fractures fail in shear.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding deltaic channel dynamics is essential to acquiring
   knowledge on how deltas respond to environmental changes, as channels
   control the distribution of water, sediment, and nutrients.
   Channel-resolving morphodynamic models provide the basis for
   quantitative study of channel-scale dynamics, but they need to be
   properly assessed with a set of robust metrics able to quantitatively
   characterize delta patterns and dynamics before being used as predictive
   tools. In this work we use metrics developed in the context of delta
   formation, to assess the morphodynamic results of DeltaRCM, a
   parcel-based cellular model for delta formation and evolution. By
   comparing model results to theoretical predictions and field and
   experimental observations, we show that DeltaRCM captures the geometric
   growth characteristics of deltas such as fractality of channel network,
   spatial distribution of wet and dry surfaces, and temporal dynamics of
   channel-scale processes such as the decay of channel planform
   correlation. After evaluating the ability of DeltaRCM to produce delta
   patterns and dynamics at the scale of channel processes, we use the
   model to predict the deltaic response to relative sea level rise (RSLR).
   We show that uniform subsidence and absolute sea level rise have similar
   effects on delta evolution and cause intensified channel branching.
   Channel network fractality and channel mobility increase with
   higher-RSLR rates, while the spatial and temporal scales of avulsion
   events decrease, resulting in smaller sand bodies in the stratigraphy.
   Our modeling results provide the first set of quantitative predictions
   of the effects of RSLR on river deltas with a specific focus on the
   distributary channel network.}},

Title = {{Impact of gravity on hydrate saturation in gas-rich environments}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1265-1285}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We extend a one-dimensional analytical solution by including
   buoyancy-driven flow to explore the impact of gravity on hydrate
   formation from gas injection into brine-saturated sediments within the
   hydrate stability zone. This solution includes the fully coupled gas and
   liquid phase flow and the associated advective transport in a
   homogeneous system. We obtain the saturations assuming Darcy flow under
   combined pressure and gravity gradients; capillary forces are neglected.
   At a high gas supply rate, the overpressure gradient (gradient of water
   pressure deviation from the hydrostatic pressure) dominates the gas
   flow, and the hydrate saturation is independent of the flow rate and
   flow direction. At a low gas supply rate, the buoyancy (the drive for
   gas flow induced by the density difference between gas and liquid)
   dominates the gas flow, and the hydrate saturation depends on the flow
   rate and flow direction. Hydrate saturation is highest for upward flow,
   and lowest for downward flow. Hydrate saturation decreases with flow
   rate for upward flow, and increases with flow rate for downward flow. In
   all cases, hydrate saturation is constant behind the hydrate
   solidification front. Gas saturation is homogeneous and close to the
   residual value for upward flow at a low rate; gas flows at the rate it

   decreases from the gas inlet to the hydrate solidification front for

Abstract = {{Nonreciprocal components are ubiquitous in electronic and optical
   systems. To date, the use of magneto-optical materials has been the
   prevailing method to achieve non-reciprocity. However, magnetic-based
   devices are accompanied by several drawbacks, such as the requirement of
   bulky biasing devices and their incompatibility with semiconductor
   technology, which make their integration challenging. Recently, strong
   magnetless nonreciprocity was demonstrated in spatiotemporally modulated
   coupled-resonator networks as a result of an effective spin imparted to
   the structure by an RF signal. These structures can be easily
   integrated, and they potentially exhibit good power and noise
   performance, as any parametric device. Here, we develop an analytical
   theory for such devices, which allows determining the conditions for
   designing them with optimum characteristics, and present two designs
   based on lumped-and distributed-element circuits for applications at the
   very high-frequency and wireless-communications bands, respectively. The
   circulators exhibit large isolation and low insertion loss within
   reasonable modulation requirements. Furthermore, they can be realized
   with a modulation frequency substantially lower than the input
   frequency, significantly simplifying the design. Measurements for the
   lumped-element design are provided and show good agreement with theory
   and full-wave simulations. The nonlinear characteristics of the
   presented designs are also studied, and possible ways to reduce
   nonlinear distortion by increasing the static bias of the varactors or
   using advanced varactor topologies are explored.}},

Abstract = {{Porous materials such as rocks, soils, and peats are typically complex
   mixtures built up of more than one component, with intrinsic
   permeabilities that depend on factors such as pore shape and surface
   area, tortuosity, and connectivity. In such media, the macroscopic
   permeability is an integrated combination of the permeabilities of the
   individual components. In this study, we numerically simulated fluid
   flow in binary mixtures of low-and high-permeability components
   constructed of spheres and ellipsoids using the lattice-Boltzmann (LB)
   method to model permeability in porous media. We then applied the
   effective-medium approximation (EMA) to predict permeability in the
   simulated binary mixtures. Our results indicate a very good match
   between predicted permeabilities by EMA and those simulated by LB in
   simple and body-centered cubic packs as long as the permeability of the
   high-permeability component K-h is not substantially different than that
   of the low-permeability component K-l. The upper limit of K-h/K-l for
   which the EMA approach results in very accurate permeability predictions
   depends on several factors, such as packing arrangement, grain shape,
   and porosity. Including all data, we found the EMA permeability
   predictions still within a factor of two of the LB simulations.}},

Title = {{In-vivo stretch of term human fetal membranes}},
Journal = {{PLACENTA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{57-66}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Fetal membranes (FM) usually fail prior to delivery during
   term labor, but occasionally fail at preterm gestation, precipitating
   preterm birth. To understand the FM biomechanical properties underlying
   these events, study of the baseline in-vivo stretch experienced by the
   FM is required. This study's objective was to utilize high resolution
   MRI imaging to determine in-vivo FM stretch.
   Methods: Eight pregnant women (38.4 +/- 0.4wks) underwent
   abdominal-pelvic MRI prior to (2.88 +/- 0.83d) caesarean delivery.
   Software was utilized to determine the total FM in-vivo surface area
   (SA) and that of its components: placental disc and reflected FM. At
   delivery, the SA of the disc and FM in the relaxed state were measured.
   In-vivo (stretched) to delivered SA ratios were calculated. FM fragments
   were then biaxially stretched to determine the force required to
   re-stretch the FM back to in-vivo SA.
   Results: Total FM SA, in-vivo vs delivered, was 2135.51 +/- 108.47 cm(2)
   vs 842.59 +/- 35.86 cm(2); reflected FM was 1778.42 +/- 107.39 cm(2) vs
   545.41 +/- 22.90 cm(2), and disc was 357.10 +/- 28.08 cm(2) vs 297.18
   +/- 22.14 cm(2). The ratio (in-vivo to in-vitro SA) of reflected FM was
   3.26 +/- 0.11 and disc was 1.22 +/- 0.10. Reflected FM re stretched to
   in-vivo SA generated a tension of 72.26 Nim, corresponding to
   approximate pressure of 15.4 mmHg. FM rupture occurred at 295.08 +/-
   31.73 Nim corresponding to approximate pressure of 34 mmHg.
   Physiological SA was 70\% of that at rupture.
   Discussion: FM are significantly distended in-vivo. FM collagen fibers
   were rapidly recruited once loaded and functioned near the failure state
   during in-vitro testing, suggesting that, in-vivo, minimal additional
   (beyond physiological) stretch may facilitate rapid, catastrophic
   failure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A miniature laser ablation probe relying on an optical fiber to deliver
   light requires a high coupling efficiency objective with sufficient
   magnification in order to provide adequate power and field for surgery.
   A diffraction-limited optical design is presented that utilizes high
   refractive index zinc sulfide to meet specifications while reducing the
   miniature objective down to two lenses. The design has a hypercentric
   conjugate plane on the fiber side and is telecentric on the tissue end.
   Two versions of the objective were built on a diamond lathe-a
   traditional cylindrical design and a custom-tapered mount. Both received
   an antireflective coating. The objectives performed as designed in terms
   of observable resolution and field of view as measured by imaging a 1951
   USAF resolution target. The slanted edge technique was used to find
   Strehl ratios of 0.75 and 0.78, respectively, indicating nearly
   diffraction-limited performance. Finally, preliminary ablation

Title = {{Slowing Translation between Protein Domains by Increasing Affinity
   between mRNAs and the Ribosomal Anti-Shine Dalgarno Sequence Improves
   Solubility}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated that effective protein production
   requires coordination of multiple cotranslational cellular processes,
   which are heavily affected by translation timing. Until recently,
   protein engineering has focused on codon optimization to maximize
   protein production rates, mostly considering the effect of tRNA
   abundance. However, as it relates to complex multidomain proteins, it
   has been hypothesized that strategic translational pauses between
   domains and between distinct individual structural motifs can prevent
   interactions between nascent chain fragments that generate kinetically
   trapped misfolded peptides and thereby enhance protein yields. In this
   study, we introduce synthetic transient pauses between structural
   domains in a heterologous model protein based on designed patterns of
   affinity between the mRNA and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (aSD) sequence on
   the ribosome. We demonstrate that optimizing translation attenuation at
   domain boundaries can predictably affect solubility patterns in
   bacteria. Exploration of the affinity space showed that modifying less
   than 1\% of the nucleotides (on a small 12 amino acid linker) can vary
   soluble protein yields up to 7 fold without altering the primary
   sequence of the protein. In the context of longer linkers, where a
   larger number of distinct structural motifs can fold outside the
   ribosome, optimal synonymous codon variations resulted in an additional
   2.1-fold increase in solubility, relative to that of nonoptimized
   linkers of the same length. While rational construction of 54 linkers of
   various affinities showed a significant correlation between protein
   solubility and predicted affinity, only weaker correlations were
   observed between tRNA abundance and protein solubility. We also
   demonstrate that naturally occurring high-affinity clusters are present
   between structural domains of beta-galactosidase, one of Escherichia
   coli's largest native proteins. Interdomain ribosomal affinity is an
   important factor that has not previously been explored in the context of
   protein engineering.}},

Title = {{Biomechanical Challenges to Polymeric Biodegradable Stents}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable implants have demonstrated clinical success in simple
   applications (e.g., absorbable sutures) and have shown great potential
   in many other areas of interventional medicine, such as localized drug
   delivery, engineered tissue scaffolding, and structural implants. For
   endovascular stenting and musculoskeletal applications, they can serve
   as temporary mechanical support that provides a smooth stress-transfer
   from the degradable implant to the healing tissue. However, for more
   complex device geometries, in vivo environments, and evolving
   load-bearing functions, such as required for vascular stents, there are
   considerable challenges associated with the use of biodegradable
   materials. A biodegradable stent must restore blood flow and provide
   support for a predictable appropriate period to facilitate artery
   healing, and subsequently, fail safely and be absorbed in a controllable
   manner. Biodegradable polymers are typically weaker than metals
   currently employed to construct stents, so it is difficult to ensure
   sufficient strength to keep the artery open and alleviate symptoms
   acutely while keeping other design parameters within clinically
   acceptable ranges. These design challenges are serious, given the
   general lack of understanding of biodegradable polymer behavior and
   evolution in intimal operating conditions. The modus operandi is mainly
   empirical and relies heavily on trial-and-error methodologies burdened
   by difficult, resource-expensive, and time-consuming experiments. We are
   striving for theoretical advancements systematizing the empirical
   knowledge into rational frameworks that could be cast into in silico
   tools for simulation and product development optimization. These
   challenges are evident when one considers that there are no
   biodegradable stents on the US market despite more than 30 years of
   development efforts (and currently only a couple with CE mark). This
   review summarizes previous efforts at implementing biodegradable stents,
   discusses the specific challenges involved, and presents recently
   developed material-modeling frameworks that can benefit this exciting
   field.}},

Abstract = {{In most wireless networks, nodes have only limited local information
   about the state of the network, which includes connectivity and channel
   state information. With limited local information about the network,
   each node's knowledge is mismatched; therefore, they must make
   distributed decisions. In this paper, we pose the following question: If
   every node has network state information only about a small
   neighborhood, how and when should nodes choose to transmit? While link
   scheduling answers the above question for point-to-point physical layers
   that are designed for an interference-avoidance paradigm, we look for
   answers in cases when interference can be embraced by advanced PHY-layer
   design, as suggested by results in network information theory. To make
   progress on this challenging problem, we propose a constructive
   distributed algorithm that achieves rates higher than link scheduling
   based on interference avoidance, especially if each node knows more than
   one hop of network state information. We compare our new aggressive
   algorithm to a conservative algorithm we have presented in a 2013
   conference paper. Both algorithms schedule subnetworks such that each
   subnetwork can employ advanced interference-embracing coding schemes to
   achieve higher rates. Our innovation is in the identification,
   selection, and scheduling of subnetworks, especially when subnetworks
   are larger than a single link.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The prostate gland mainly contains basal and luminal cells constructed
   as a pseudostratified epithelium. Annotation of prostate epithelial
   transcriptomes provides a foundation for discoveries that can impact
   disease understanding and treatment. Here we describe a genome-wide
   transcriptome analysis of human benign prostatic basal and luminal
   epithelial populations using deep RNA sequencing. Through molecular and
   biological characterizations, we show that the differential
   gene-expression profiles account for their distinct functional
   properties. Strikingly, basal cells preferentially express gene
   categories associated with stem cells, neurogenesis and ribosomal RNA
   (rRNA) biogenesis. Consistent with this profile, basal cells
   functionally exhibit intrinsic stem-like and neurogenic properties with
   enhanced rRNA transcription activity. Of clinical relevance, the basal
   cell gene-expression profile is enriched in advanced, anaplastic,
   castration-resistant and metastatic prostate cancers. Therefore, we link
   the cell-type-specific gene signatures to aggressive subtypes of
   prostate cancer and identify gene signatures associated with adverse
   clinical features.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption/desorption effects impact the petro-physical properties
   of matrix pores during gas depressurizing production, such as effective
   pore radius, effective porosity, apparent permeability, which will
   further impact the gas flow regime. In this paper, the dynamic models of
   effective pore radius and apparent permeability under the action of gas
   adsorption/desorption are derived. The mathematical model of shale gas
   flow is established considering the effects of adsorbed gas on apparent
   properties and gas flow regime. After that, the model is solved and
   validated using a finite volume method and experimental and field data.
   Finally, the variations of apparent parameters of matrix pores and gas
   flow regimes during gas production, and the influences of adsorption on
   gas production are demonstrated. The results show that the effective
   pore radius, porosity and apparent permeability increase during gas
   production; the gas flow regime in stimulated reservoir volume (SRV)
   changes from slip flow to transition flow; if the impacts of adsorbed
   gas on gas production is overlooked, both original gas in place (OGIP)
   and gas production will be significantly overestimated. The cumulative
   gas production changes slightly as the adsorption layer thickness
   increases, but the gas recovery factor decreases.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation time distributions are
   frequently combined with mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP)
   measurements to allow determination of pore or pore throat size
   distributions directly from the NMR data. The combination of these two
   measurements offers an advantage over high-resolution imaging techniques
   in terms of cost and measurement time, and can provide estimates of pore
   sizes for pores below imaging resolution. However, the methods that are
   typically employed to combine NMR and MICP measurements do not
   necessarily honor the way in which the two different measurements
   respond to the size distribution and connectivity of the pore system. We
   present a method for combining NMR and MICP data that is based on
   percolation theory and the relationship between bond occupation
   probability and the probability that a bond is part of a percolating

Abstract = {{The acoustic wave propagation from a two-dimensional subwavelength slit
   surrounded by metal plates decorated with Helmholtz resonators (HRs) is

   asymmetric effective impedance boundary will be obtained, which
   contributes to generating tunable acoustic radiation pattern such as
   directional acoustic beaming. These dipole-like radiation patterns have
   high radiation efficiency, no fingerprint of sidelobes, and a wide
   tunable range of the radiation pattern directivity angle which can be
   steered by the spatial displacements of HRs.}},

Abstract = {{An X-tolerant multiple-input signature register (MISR) compaction
   methodology that compacts output streams containing unknown (X) values,
   called X-canceling, is an alternative to masking X values (i.e.,
   X-masking). A number of control bits that is linear in the number of X's
   to be canceled are required to perform the X-canceling operation for
   existing X-canceling approaches. This paper proposes a new X-canceling
   method significantly reducing the number of control bits for
   X-canceling. We exploit the fact that 1) unknown values tend to be
   highly correlated in the scan cells (i.e., X's tend to be generated in
   certain portions of design) and 2) fault effects can typically be
   observed in a multiplicity of scan cells. Instead of custom generating
   the control bits to cancel out only the X's in one MISR signature, the
   proposed approach finds a general superset solution which can cancel out
   the X's for many MISR signatures without losing fault coverage. This
   allows the same control bits to be reused many times thereby
   significantly improving the amount of compression that can be obtained.
   Architectures for implementing superset X-canceling are described along
   with experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the elderly
   population and it is associated with a four-fold to five-fold increased
   risk of thromboembolic events. It was not until the mid-1950s that the
   left atrial appendage (LAA) was identified as the main location of
   thrombus formation, particularly in patients with non-valvular AF. In
   this review, we explain at some extent its embryology, anatomy and
   physiology, and as well as the clinical and pre-clinical trials
   published to date testing the safety and efficacy of most LAA closure
   devices. Among those devices, the most studied include the PLAATO system
   (ev3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN), the Amplatzer cardiac plug (St Jude,
   Golden Valley, MN; St. Jude Medical, Minneapolis, MN), the WATCHMAN
   device (Boston Scientific, Plymouth, MN; Atritech Inc., Plymouth, MN),
   and the LARIAT device (SentreHEART, Palo Alto, CA). Similarly, newer LAA
   closure devices currently under investigation such as the Transcatheter
   Patch (Custom Medical Devices, Athens, Greece), AEGIS, and the Coherex
   WaveCrest (Salt Lake City, UT) will also be discussed. Future
   perspectives and the need for well-designed prospective studies between
   devices and new oral anticoagulant drugs are also proposed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The poor kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are a
   considerable barrier to the development of water-derived hydrogen fuel.
   Previous work regarding theoretical calculations of the perovskite
   SrCoO3-delta(SCO) predicts a surface binding energy ideal for OER
   catalysis but could not be matched to experimental results due to the
   material's propensity to form the incorrect trigonal crystal structure.
   By doping with iron and scandium, X-ray diffraction confirms that we
   have been able to synthesize a series of SCO catalysts of various
   crystal structures, culminating in cubic SCO. In doing so, we show that
   there is a limited correlation between the crystal structure and OER
   performance in alkaline media. Instead, the use of iron as a dopant is
   found to decrease the OER overpotential of the SCO by 40 mV in 0.1 M KOH
   and yield catalysts capable of performing water oxidation at an
   overpotential of 410 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). The doped, cubic SCO catalysts
   are found to be more stable than the undoped material when tested for
   extended periods, showing only an approximate 3 mV increase in
   overpotential over a 2 h period at 10 mA/cm(2). Our results show that
   proper doping of the B-site cation in SCO allows for tuning the
   structure, performance, and stability of the oxide as an OER
   electrocatalyst.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing wide use of hydraulic fractures in the petroleum
   industry, it is essential to accurately predict the behavior of
   fractures based on the understanding of fundamental mechanisms governing
   the process. For effective reservoir exploration and development,
   hydraulic fracture pattern, geometry and associated dimensions are
   critical in determining well stimulation efficiency. In shale
   formations, non-planar, complex hydraulic fractures are often observed,
   due to the activation of preexisting natural fractures and the
   interaction between multiple, simultaneously propagating hydraulic
   fractures. The propagation of turning non-planar fractures due to the
   interference of nearby producing wells has also been reported. Current
   numerical simulation of hydraulic fracturing generally assumes planar
   crack geometry and weak coupling behavior, which severely limits the
   applicability of these methods in predicting fracture propagation under
   complex subsurface conditions. In addition, the prevailing approach for
   hydraulic fracture modeling also relies on linear elastic fracture
   mechanics (LEFM) by assuming the rock behaves purely elastically until
   complete failure. LEFM can predict hard rock hydraulic fracturing
   processes reasonably, but often fails to give accurate predictions of
   fracture geometry and propagation pressure in ductile and quasi-brittle
   rocks, such as poorly consolidated/unconsolidated sands and ductile
   shales, even in the form of simple planar geometry. In this study, we
   present a fully coupled poro-elasto-plastic model for hydraulic fracture
   propagation based on the theories of extend finite element, cohesive
   zone method and Mohr-Coulomb plasticity, which is able to capture
   complex hydraulic fracture geometry and plastic deformations in
   reservoir rocks explicitly. To illustrate the capabilities of the model,
   example simulations are presented including ones involving
   simultaneously propagating multiple hydraulic fractures and producing
   well interference. The results indicate that both stress shadow effects
   and producing well interference can alter hydraulic fracture propagation
   behavior substantially, and shear failure in ductile reservoir rocks can
   indeed make a significant difference in fracturing pressure and final
   fracture geometry.}},

Title = {{Assessment of mechanical rock alteration caused by CO2-water mixtures

Abstract = {{CO2 injection into geological formations disturbs the geochemical
   equilibrium between water and minerals. Thus, some mineral phases are
   prone to dissolution and precipitation with ensuing changes of
   petrophysical and geomechanical properties of the host formations.
   Chemically-assisted degradation of mechanical properties can endanger
   the structural integrity of the storage formation and must be carefully
   studied and considered to guarantee safe long-term trapping. Few
   experimental data sets involving CO2 alteration and mechanical testing
   of rock samples are available since these experiments are length,
   expensive, and require specialized equipment and personnel. Autoclave
   experiments are easier to perform and control but result in a limited
   ``skin depth{''} of chemically-altered zone near the surface of the
   sample. This article presents the validation of micro-indentation and
   micro-scratch tests as efficient tools to assess the alteration of
   mechanical properties of rocks geochemically altered by CO2-water
   mixtures. Results from tests on sandstone and siltstone from Crystal
   Geyser, Utah naturally altered by CO2-acidified water show that
   mechanical parameters measured with indentation (indentation hardness,
   Young's modulus and contact creep compliance rate) and scratching
   (scratch hardness and fracture toughness) consistently indicated
   weakening of the rock after CO2-induced alteration. Decreases of
   measured parameters vary from 14\% to 87\%. Experimental results and
   analyses show that micromechanical tests are potentially quick and
   reliable tools to determine the change of mechanical properties of rocks
   subject to exposure to CO2-acidified water, particularly in
   well-controlled autoclave experiments. Measured parameters are not
   intended to provide inputs for coupled reservoir simulation with
   geomechanics but rather to inform the execution of larger scale tests
   investigating the susceptibility of rock fades to chemical alteration by
   CO2-water mixtures. Recognizing this susceptibility of rock facies of
   CO2 geological storage target formations is critical to controlling
   undesired emergent behavior associated with CO2 sequestration. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Stress wave stimulation of geological formations has potential
   applications in petroleum engineering, hydro geology, and environmental
   engineering. The stimulation can be applied using wave sources whose
   spatio-temporal characteristics are designed to focus the emitted wave
   energy into the target region. Typically, the design process involves
   numerical simulations of the underlying wave physics, and assumes a
   perfect knowledge of the material properties and the overall geometry of
   the geostructure. In practice, however, precise knowledge of the
   properties of the geological formations is elusive, and quantification
   of the reliability of a deterministic approach is crucial for evaluating
   the technical and economical feasibility of the design. In this article,
   we discuss a methodology that could be used to quantify the uncertainty
   in the wave energy delivery. We formulate the wave propagation problem
   for a two-dimensional, layered, isotropic, elastic solid truncated using
   hybrid perfectly-matched-layers (PMLs), and containing a target elastic
   or poroelastic inclusion. We define a wave motion metric to quantify the
   amount of the delivered wave energy. We, then, treat the material
   properties of the layers as random variables, and perform a first-order
   uncertainty analysis of the formation to compute the probabilities of
   failure to achieve threshold values of the motion metric. We illustrate
   the uncertainty quantification procedure using synthetic data. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This article presents a framework for integrating a regional geographic
   information system (GIS)-based nitrogen dataset (Texas Anthropogenic
   Nitrogen Dataset, TX-ANB) and a GIS-based river routing model (Routing
   Application for Parallel computation of Discharge) to simulate
   steady-state riverine total nitrogen (TN) transport in river networks
   containing thousands of reaches. A two-year case study was conducted in
   the San Antonio and Guadalupe basins during dry and wet years (2008 and
   2009, respectively). This article investigates TN export in urbanized
   (San Antonio) vs. rural (Guadalupe) drainage basins and considers the
   effect of reservoirs on TN transport. Simulated TN export values are
   within 10 percent of measured export values for selected stations in
   2008 and 2009. Results show that in both years the San Antonio basin
   contributed a larger quantity than the Guadalupe basin of delivered TN
   to the coastal ocean. The San Antonio basin is affected by urban
   activities including point sources, associated with the city of San
   Antonio, in addition to greater agricultural activities. The Guadalupe
   basin lacks major metropolitan areas and is dominated by rangeland,
   rather than fertilized agricultural fields. Both basins delivered more
   TN to coastal waters in 2009 than in 2008. Furthermore, TN removal in
   the San Antonio and Guadalupe basins is inversely related to stream
   orders: the higher the order the more TN delivery (or the less TN
   removal).}},

Title = {{A study on simultaneous design of a Hall Effect Thruster and its
   low-thrust trajectory}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{34-47}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Space missions involving Hall Effect Thrusters are more and more common,
   and designs of both Hall Effect Thrusters and low-thrust trajectories
   require more elaborated process to meet the on-going mission demands.
   The design of a new Hall Effect Thruster can be improved by considering
   mission goals for high-demand missions rather than by relying on the
   current empirical and experimental design process. Moreover, the
   optimization of low-thrust trajectories involving the Hall Effect
   Thrusters can also be improved by incorporating the physics of the Hall
   Effect Thrusters rather than using a simplified model of the given
   thruster or incorporating the limited existing thruster characteristics.
   In order to accomplish these two objectives, a simultaneous design
   environment of the Hall Effect Thruster and its associated low-thrust
   trajectory is developed. By linking these two disciplines through a
   direct embedding of the Hall thruster analysis module within the low
   thrust optimal control problem, we show that a new Hall Effect Thruster
   and the associated low-thrust trajectory can be designed simultaneously.
   As a starting example applying this coupled strategy, a plausible,
   high-demand mission scenario is attempted with highly simplified
   assumptions on trajectory optimization, which is the final stage of a
   geostationary transfer orbit that takes place entirely outside the Van
   Allen radiation belts. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effects of automatic indoor set point temperature setbacks using
   smart thermostats in response to time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates
   structures on occupant thermal comfort are evaluated for representative
   single family residential buildings located in 3 climate zones with
   dominant cooling loads. Building energy models (BEM) of single family
   homes are evaluated using a full factorial experimental design to create
   a response surface which provides a continuous function to evaluate the
   impact of four design variables on long-term thermal comfort indices,
   including Average Percent of People Dissatisfied (Average PPD), and
   Percentage Outside Thermal Comfort Zone (POS). These design variables
   include indoor set point temperature, degrees of setback temperature in
   cooling mode, building thermal mass, and air exchange rate for each
   climate zone. These are compared to the relative energy savings
   resulting from TOU thermostat setbacks while considering other design
   variables. A second-order response surface is found to provide a
   reasonable fit to BEM simulation in- and out-of-sample data. The set
   point temperature is the most influential of the variables studied in
   decreasing long-term thermal comfort, while reducing HVAC electricity
   use. The thermostat setback has the strongest influence on thermal
   comfort in a hot-dry climate, while the most HVAC energy savings is able
   to be achieved in the mixed-humid climate zone. The results are
   tabulated for weighing the costs and benefits of TOU electricity rates
   for homes with different characteristics, in climate zones with air
   conditioning-dominate energy consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A nonlinear process with input multiplicity has two or more input values
   for a given output at the steady state, and the process steady state
   gain changes its sign as the operating point changes. A control system
   with integral action will be unstable when both signs of the process
   gain and the controller integral gain are different, and its stability
   region will be limited to the boundary where the process steady state
   gain is zero. Unlike processes with output multiplicities, feedback
   controllers cannot be used to correct the sign changes of process gain.
   To remove such stability limitation, a simple control system with
   parallel compensator is proposed. The parallel compensator can be easily
   designed based on the process steady state gain information and tuned in
   the field. Using the two time scale method, the stability of proposed
   control systems for processes with input multiplicities can be checked.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer injectivity is an important factor for evaluating the project
   economics of chemical flood, which is highly related to the polymer
   viscosity. Because the flow rate varies rapidly near injectors and
   significantly changes the polymer viscosity due to the non-Newtonian
   rheological behavior, the polymer viscosity near the wellbore is
   difficult to estimate accurately with the practical gridblock size in
   reservoir simulation. To reduce the impact of polymer rheology upon
   chemical EOR simulations, we used an efficient multilevel local grid
   refinement (LGR) method that provides a higher resolution of the flows
   in the near-wellbore region. An efficient numerical scheme was proposed
   to accurately solve the pressure equation and concentration equations on
   the multilevel grid for both homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoir
   cases. The block list and connections of the multilevel grid are
   generated via an efficient and extensible algorithm. Field case
   simulation results indicate that the proposed LGR is consistent with the
   analytical injectivity model and achieves the closest results to the
   full grid refinement, which considerably improves the accuracy of
   solutions compared with the original grid. In addition, the method was
   validated by comparing it with the LGR module of CMG\_STARS. Besides
   polymer injectivity calculations, the LGR method is applicable for other
   problems in need of near-wellbore treatment, such as fractures near
   wells.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting the center of the fovea and its boundary in a human retinal

   images. In this paper, a novel method for detecting the center of the
   fovea and its boundary in a fundus image is proposed. A fuzzy rule-based
   technique has been implemented along with a gradient vector flow
   (GVF)-based active contour technique in order to detect the boundary of
   the foveal avascular zone as well as its center. The proposed method
   exhibits to be promising in detecting fovea regions in wide range of

   key functions (vehicle functions requested from outside the car) and
   car-home connectivity functions (communications between car and home),
   among others. Both revealed and stated preference datasets from a survey
   of U.S. drivers are used. The multivariate probit model and Bayesian
   estimation method are used to analyze consumer preferences. The results
   showed different preferences depending on socio-demographics and vehicle
   types. This paper provides marketing strategies for smart key functions

   Oxygen-vacancy sites on SiO2 are the inherent sites for defect-mediated

Title = {{Simulation of proppant transport with gravitational settling and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{298-314}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We implement proppant transport in a three-dimensional hydraulic
   fracturing simulator, including proppant settlement due to gravity, tip
   screen-out, and fracture closure. Constitutive equations are used that
   account for processes that can cause the flowing fraction of proppant to
   be different from the volumetric fraction of proppant. The constitutive
   equations capture the transition from Poiseuille flow to Darcy flow as
   the slurry transitions from dilute mixture to packed bed. We introduce
   new constitutive equations that allow the simulator to seamlessly
   describe the process of fracture closure, including a nonlinear joint
   closure law expressing fracture compliance and roughness and accounting
   for the effect of proppant accumulation into a packed layer between the
   fracture walls. We perform sensitivity analysis simulations to
   investigate the effect of fluid viscosity, proppant density, proppant
   size, and formation permeability. The simulations confirm that tip
   screen-out can limit fracture length, cause proppant banking, and
   increase injection pressure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that
   reasonably accurate results can be achieved without excessive mesh
   refinement. We also perform a simulation of hydraulic fracture
   propagation through a complex natural fracture network. In this
   simulation, proppant tends to accumulate at the intersections between
   natural and hydraulic fractures. Overall, the results suggest that in
   very low permeability formations, proppant settling is a major problem
   for proppant placement because proppant tends to gravitationally settle
   before fracture closure can occur. Because leakoff is so slow, proppant
   immobilization through bridging is critical for vertical proppant
   placement. Bridging can occur at aperture approximately three times
   greater than particle diameter, which will occur much sooner after
   shut-in than full mechanical closure. Even though larger diameter
   proppant settles more rapidly, it may lead to better proppant placement
   because it will bridge sooner, at a larger fracture aperture. These
   results also suggest that it is critical to optimize injection schedule
   in order to avoid tip screen-out, which leads to a shorter, wider
   fracture in which bridging is less likely to occur. Our modeling
   approach can be used practically for optimization of proppant placement
   through selection of fluid properties, proppant properties, and
   injection schedule. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Geological CO2 sequestration is one of the most promising methods for
   reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Saline
   aquifers, coal beds, depleted oil and gas reservoirs are all ideal
   locations for greenhouse gas storage. For a sedimentary basin, CO2 can
   exist in gas, liquid or supercritical fluid phase state. It will cause
   totally different response for the seismic waves where seismic methods
   are widely used for sequestration monitoring. To better understand the
   phase transition effect, ultrasonic experiments were conducted in 6
   natural cores with fully saturated brine and CO2, respectively. Due to
   the significant difference in compressibility, the obvious inflexions
   for both P-wave velocity and amplitude were concluded to be caused by
   the phase transitions. In addition, an increase in dew point pressure of
   CO2 in porous media was observed. Temperature and rock porosity are two
   key factors which dominates these changes. (C) 2015 Energy Institute.

Abstract = {{Heart valve interstitial cells (VICs) play a critical role in the

   and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, and upregulated expression and
   strong contraction of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) fibers.
   However, it remains unknown how expression and contraction of the

   the underlying cytoskeletal network, 2) the oriented a-SMA stress fibers
   with passive elastic and active contractile responses, 3) a finite
   deformable elastic nucleus. We implemented the model in a full 3D finite
   element simulation of a VIC based on known geometry. Moreover, we
   examined the respective mechanical responses of aortic and pulmonary
   VICs (AVICs and PVICs, respectively), which are known to have different
   levels of alpha-SMA expression levels and contractile behaviors. To
   calibrate the model, we simulated the combined mechanical responses of
   VICs in both micropipette aspiration (MA) and atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) experiments. These two states were chosen as the VICs were under
   significantly different mechanical loading conditions and activation
   states, with the a-SMA fibers inactivated in the MA studies while fully
   activated in the AFM studies. We also used the AFM to study the
   mechanical property of the nucleus. Our model predicted that the
   substantial differences found in stiffening of the AVIC compared to the
   PVICs was due to a 9 to 16 times stronger intrinsic AVIC alpha-SMA
   stress fiber contractile force. Model validation was done by simulating
   a traction force microscopy experiment to estimate the forces the VICs
   exert on the underlying substrate, and found good agreement with
   reported traction force microscopy results. Further, estimated nuclear
   stiffness for both AVICs and PVICs were similar and comparable to the
   literature, and were both unaffected by VIC activation level. These
   results suggest substantial functional differences between AVICs and
   PVICs at the subcellular level. Moreover, this first VIC computational
   biomechanical model is but a first step in developing a comprehensive,
   integrated view of the VIC pathophysiology and interactions with the
   valve ECM micro-environment based on simulation technologies. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Recent advances in metasurfaces, i.e., artificial arrays of engineered
   inclusions assembled over a thin surface, have opened promising venues
   to control electromagnetic waves in unique and unprecedented ways, by
   means of locally engineering their near-field wave-matter interactions.
   Gradient or locally nonperiodic metasurfaces are one of the most
   exciting recent advances in nano-optics, due to the promise of enabling
   ultimate light molding, in both the near-field and the far-field, with
   large efficiency and a minimal footprint. These artificial surfaces are
   characterized by a transverse variation of their surface properties and
   lack of local periodicity, distinguishing them from conventional
   frequency selective surfaces and optical gratings. In this paper, we
   review recent work in the area of gradient metasurfaces, aimed at
   arbitrary wave shaping. The significant recent progress and novel
   applications achieved through optical metasurfaces, including ultrathin
   invisibility cloaks and polarization-dependent light splitting, are
   discussed, outlining the typical challenges and their outstanding
   prospects in integrated nanophotonic devices. Following our discussion
   on metasurface design approaches, we then revisit the problem of
   controlling the distribution of energy between multiple diffraction
   orders by means of gradient metasurfaces. Our discussions reveal that
   Huygens-based designs hold the promise of overcoming the low conversion
   efficiency issues associated with other techniques. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{Efficient light manipulation at subwavelength scale is of great interest
   for solar energy conversion, optical sensing, and nanophotonic devices.
   Recently, plasmonic nanopatch antennas (PNAs), which consist of
   plasmonic nanoparticles and metal films with thin layers of dielectric
   spacers sandwiched between them, have shown promise for directing and
   enhancing radiation from the dipole emitters at the PNAs. Herein, we
   apply finite-difference time-domain simulations to comparatively study
   the radiative enhancement of a series of PNAs consisting of Ag
   nanoparticles with different geometries, i.e., nanosquare, nanotriangle,
   nanorod, and nanodisk. We find that the shape of the Ag nanoparticles
   influences the resonant wavelength of the plasmonic waveguide modes in
   the spacers, the enhancement of localized electric field, and multiple
   aspects of the radiation, including spontaneous emission rate, quantum
   efficiency, and radiative enhancement factor. Nanodisk-based PNAs
   exhibit both high quantum efficiency (similar to 0.74) and radiative
   enhancement factor (> 20), while nanotriangle-based PNAs show remarkable
   spontaneous emission rate enhancement (> 2500). Furthermore, we examine
   the effects of dipole emitter locations on the radiative properties. Our
   results pave the way towards the rational design of PNAs for the optimal
   plasmonic enhancement of light emission for targeted applications.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The definition and description of student success programs in the
   literature (e.g., orientation, first-year seminars, learning
   communities, etc.) suggest underlying programmatic similarities. Yet
   researchers to date typically depend on ambiguous labels to delimit
   studies, resulting in loosely related but separate research lines and
   few generalizable findings. To demonstrate whether or how certain
   programs are effective there is need for more coherent
   conceptualizations to identify and describe programs. This is
   particularly problematic for community colleges where success programs
   are uniquely tailored relative to other sectors. The study's purpose is
   to derive an empirical typology of community college student success
   programs based on their curricular and programmatic features. Data come
   from 1047 success programs at 336 U.S.-based respondents to the
   Community College Institutional Survey. Because programs might be
   characterized by their focus in different curricular areas and
   combinations of foci, we used factor mixture modeling, a hybrid of
   factor analysis and latent class analysis, which provides a model-based
   classification method that simultaneously accounts for dimensional and
   categorical data structures. Descriptive findings revealed extensive
   commonalities among nominal program types. Inferential analysis revealed
   five factors (types) of program elements, combined in unique ways among
   four latent program types: success skills programs, comprehensive
   programs, collaborative academic programs, and minimalist programs. We
   illustrate how the typology deconstructs nominal categories, may help
   unify different bodies of research, and affords a common framework and
   language for researchers and practitioners to identify and conceptualize
   programs based on what they do rather than by their names.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper takes a new look at interactions between hydroxylated silicon
   surfaces, which are commonly exploited in wafer bonding. In the past,
   strong connections have been made between the fracture toughness
   associated with such interactions. Here, we go one step further to
   examine the strength and range of the interactions, as well as the
   fracture energy from the perspective of traction-separation relations
   and cohesive zone modeling. The surface profiles of the interacting
   surfaces along with the initially bonded state were characterized by
   interferometry. The bonded silicon strips were separated by wedge
   loading while the separation of the surfaces was measured by infra-red
   crack opening interferometry. This data was used in conjunction with
   J-integral concepts to extract traction-separation relations directly.
   Variations in the fracture energy and strength and range of the
   interactions of a range of samples were linked to the mismatch in the
   waviness of the contact pairs and the amount of damage this caused.
   Finally, the strength and range of the interactions of well-bonded
   samples appeared to be linked to DLVO and capillary effects rather than
   van der Waals interactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Comparison of the characteristics and mechanisms of Hg(II) sorption by
   biochars and activated carbon}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{463}},
Pages = {{55-60}},

Abstract = {{Two biochars were produced from bagasse and hickory chips (referred to
   as BB and HCB, respectively) and evaluated for their sorption ability of
   Hg(II) in aqueous solution. A commercial activated carbon (AC) which is
   commonly used for Hg(II) removal was included for comparison. Both
   biochars showed higher sorption capacities than AC, following the trend
   of BB > HCB > AC. The sorption of Hg(II) by BB and AC was mainly
   attributed to the formation of (-COO)(2)Hg-II and (-O)(2)Hg-II. As a
   result, the adsorption capacity of Hg(II) by BB decreased 17.6\% and
   37.6\% after -COOH and -OH were blocked, respectively and that of Hg(II)
   by AC decreased 6.63\% and 62.2\% for -COOH and -OH hindered,
   respectively. However, blocking the function groups had little effect on
   the Hg removal by HCB since sorption of Hg(II) by HCB was mainly
   resulted from the pi electrons of C=C and C=O induced Hg-pi binding.
   Further X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated the
   possibility of reduction of the Hg(II) to Hg(I) by phenol groups or pi
   electrons during the removal of Hg(II) by both biochars. In conclusion,
   biochar is more effective than activated carbon in removing Hg(II) and
   there exists a high potential that biochar can be a substitute of
   activated carbon for removal of Hg(II) from wastewater. (C) 2015

   functions over arbitrary quadrilateral meshes and apply them to THCCS.
   Then, a new basis-function-insertion scheme is developed with the aid of
   the truncation mechanism, which refines one-ring neighboring elements
   rather than two-ring neighborhoods. Therefore, eTHCCS significantly
   improves the efficiency of local refinement compared with THCCS, as
   demonstrated by one benchmark problem and several complex models.
   Moreover, eTHCCS is also proved to preserve the input geometry and
   produce nested spaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Adaptive time stepping for vesicle suspensions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{306}},
Pages = {{478-499}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{We present an adaptive high-order accurate time-stepping numerical
   scheme for the flow of vesicles suspended in Stokesian fluids. Our
   scheme can be summarized as an approximate implicit spectral deferred
   correction (SDC) method. Applying a fully-implicit SDC scheme to vesicle
   flows is prohibitively expensive. For this reason we introduce several
   approximations. Our scheme is based on a semi-implicit linearized
   low-order time stepping method. (Our discretization is spectrally
   accurate in space.) We expect that the accuracy can be arbitrary-order,
   but our examples suffer from order reduction which limits the observed
   accuracy to third-order. We also use invariant properties of vesicle
   flows, constant area and boundary length in two dimensions, to reduce
   the computational cost of error estimation for adaptive time stepping.
   We present results in two dimensions for single-vesicle flows,
   constricted geometry flows, converging flows, and flows in a Couette
   apparatus. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed scheme
   enables automatic selection of the time step size and high-order
   accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconducting nanowire (NW) devices have garnered attention in
   self-powered electronic and optoelectronic applications. This work
   explores and exhibits, for the first time for visible light, clear
   evidence of the zero-biased optoelectronic switching in randomly
   dispersed Ge and Si NW networks. The test bench, on which the NWs were
   dispersed for optoelectronic characterization, was fabricated using a
   standard CMOS fabrication process, and utilized metal contacts with
   dissimilar work functions-Al and Ni. The randomly dispersed NWs respond
   to light by exhibiting substantial photocurrents and, most remarkably,
   demonstrate zero-bias photo-switching. The magnitude of the photocurrent
   is dependent on the NW material, as well as the channel length. The
   photocurrent in randomly dispersed GeNWs was found to be higher by
   orders of magnitude compared to SiNWs. In both of these material
   systems, when the length of the NWs was comparable to the channel
   length, the currents in sparse NW networks were found to be higher than
   those in dense NW networks, which can be explained by considering
   various possible arrangements of NWs in these devices.}},

   via x-ray/neutron powder diffraction, dc and ac magnetic susceptibility,
   and specific-heat measurements down to 70 mK. We found that both
   compounds undergo long-range magnetic transitions at T-N,T-C approximate
   to 0.3 K, which are ascribed to an antiferromagnetic-and
   ferromagnetic-type order for Er2Pt2O7 and Yb2Pt2O7, respectively, based
   on the field dependence of their transition temperatures as well as the
   systematic comparisons with other similar pyrochlores R2B2O7 (R = Er,
   Yb; B = Sn, Ti, Ge). The observed TN of Er2Pt2O7 is much lower than that
   expected from the relationship of TN versus the ionic radius of B4+
   derived from the series of Er2B2O7, while the T-C of Yb2Pt2O7 is the
   highest among the series of ferromagnetic compounds Yb2B2O7 (B = Sn, Pt,
   Ti). Given the monotonic variation of the lattice constant as a function
   of the B-cation size across these two series of R2B2O7 (R = Er, Yb), the
   observed anomalous values of TN, C in the Pt-based XY pyrochlores imply
   that another important factor beyond the nearest-neighbor R-R distance
   is playing a role. In light of the anisotropic exchange interactions Jex
   = \{Jzz, J +/-, J +/-, J(z)+/-\} for the S = 1/2 XY pyrochlores, we have
   rationalized these observations by considering a weakened (enhanced)
   antiferromagnetic planar J +/- (ferromagnetic Ising-like Jzz) due to
   strong Pt 5d-O2p hybridization within the plane perpendicular to the
   local {[}111] direction.}},

Title = {{Identifying Glass Compositions in Fly Ash}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{In this study, four Class F fly ashes were studied with a scanning
   electron microscope; the glassy phases were identified and their
   compositions quantified using point compositional analysis with k-means
   clustering and multispectral image analysis. The results showed that
   while the bulk oxide contents of the fly ashes were different, the four
   fly ashes had somewhat similar glassy phase compositions.
   Aluminosilicate (AS) glasses, calcium aluminosilicate (CAS) glasses, a
   mixed glass, and, in one case, a high iron glass were identified in the
   fly ashes. Quartz and iron crystalline phases were identified in each
   fly ash as well. The compositions of the three main glasses identified,
   AS, CAS, and mixed glass, were relatively similar in each ash. The
   amounts of each glass were varied by fly ash, with the highest calcium

   glasses were identified as intermixed in individual particles,
   particularly the calcium-containing glasses. Finally, the smallest
   particles in the fly ashes, with the most surface area available to
   react in alkaline solution, such as when mixed with Portland cement or
   in alkali-activated fly ash, were not different in composition than the
   large particles, with each of the glasses represented. The method used

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-containing polymer membranes are attractive
   for CO2-related gas separations due to their high selectivity toward
   CO,. However, the development of PEO-rich membranes is frequently
   challenged by weak mechanical properties and a high crystallization
   tendency of PEO that hinders gas transport. Here we report a new series
   of highly CO2-selective, amorphous PEO-containing segmented copolymers
   prepared from commercial Jeffamine polyetheramines and
   pentiptycene-based polyimide. The copolymers are much more mechanically
   robust than the non-pentiptycene containing counterparts due to the
   molecular reinforcement mechanism of supramolecular chain threading and
   interlocking interactions induced by the pentiptycene structures, which
   also effectively suppresses PEO crystallization leading to a completely
   amorphous structure even at 60\% PEO weight content. Membrane transport
   properties are sensitively affected by both PEO weight content and PEO
   chain length. A nonlinear correlation between CO, permeability with PEO
   weight content was observed due to the competition between solubility
   and diffusivity contributions, whereby the copolymers change from being
   size-selective to solubility-selective when PEO content reaches 40\%.
   CO, selectivities over H-2 and N-2 increase monotonically with both PEO
   content and chain length, indicating strong CO2-philicity of the
   copolymers. The copolymer film with the longest PEO sequence (PEO2000)
   and highest PEO weight content (60\%) showed a measured CO2 pure gas
   permeability of 39 Barrer, and ideal CO2/H-2 and CO2/N-2 selectivities
   of 4.1 and 46, respectively, at 35 degrees C and 3 atm, making them
   attractive for hydrogen purification and carbon capture.}},

Title = {{High Throughput Label Free Measurement of Cancer Cell Adhesion Kinetics
   Under Hemodynamic Flow}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{The kinetics of receptor-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix
   and adherent cell monolayers plays a key role in many physiological and
   pathological processes including cancer metastasis. Within this process
   the presence of fluidic shear forces is a key regulator of binding
   equilibrium and kinetics of cell adhesion. Current techniques to examine
   the kinetics of cell adhesion are either performed in the absence of
   flow or are low throughput, limiting their application to
   pharmacological compound screening or the high throughput investigation
   of biological mechanisms. We developed a high throughput flow device
   that applies flow in a multi-well format and interfaced this system with
   electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) system to allow label
   free detection of cell adhesion. We demonstrate that this combined
   system is capable of making real time measurements of cancer cell
   adhesion to extracellular matrix and immobilized platelets. In addition,
   we examined the dependence of the kinetics of binding of cancer cells on
   the level of shear stress and in the presence of small molecule
   inhibitors to adhesion-related pathways. This versatile system is
   broadly adaptable to the high throughput study of cell adhesion kinetics
   for many applications including drug screening and the investigation of
   the mechanisms of cancer metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadyl phostate (VOPO4) with a layered structure was successfully
   prepared by chemical delithiation of the tetragonal alpha(I)-LiVOPO4 at
   room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies show the resulting
   VOPO4 has a crystal structure similar to alpha(I)-LiVOPO4. The V4+/V5+
   redox couple exhibits a discharge plateau around 3.5 V vs Na/Na+ in
   sodium cells. The sample offers a capacity of similar to 110 mAh g(-1)
   (0.67 Na+) without any conductive coating and similar to 150 mAh g(-1)
   (0.90 Na+) with a preliminary optimization with reduced graphene oxide
   (rGO) nanosheets. The electrochemically sodiated VOPO4 electrodes show
   XRD patterns similar to the chemically sodiated VOPO4, indicating the
   formation of the same product by the two sodiation processes. Bond
   valence sum (BVS) map calculations suggest that sodium ions likely take
   the sites between two adjacent VOPO4 sheets. Rietveld refinement of the
   chemically sodiated Na0.8VOPO4 indicate that the sodium ions could take
   the 8j sites similar to the lithium ions in alpha(I)-LiVOPO4. This new
   layered VOPO4 is a competitive cathode candidate among the polyanion
   cathodes for sodium-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Hematite is a promising material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water
   splitting. While it has a low bandgap of similar to 2.1 eV it is still
   larger than the optimal value of similar to 1.8 eV. Previous work on
   epitaxial films has shown that Cr-doping leads to a shift of the bandgap
   as measured optically, but more importantly, also as measured by
   photoconductivity - to a value as low as 1.6 eV. We extend this work to
   polycrystalline films and attempt to use Cr-doping to lower the photon
   energy for which photocurrent can be generated. Our polycrystalline
   films show strong agreement with epitaxial films with regards to optical
   measurements of the direct and indirect bandgap. Furthermore, we find
   that Cr-doped polycrystalline films show photoconductivity at notably
   lower photon energies than undoped films, consistent with epitaxial
   results. However, when using Cr-doped films for photoelectrochemistry we
   find little to no shift of the photocurrent onset. We outline a number
   of proposals for why this could be the case, with a focus on the
   possibility of the existence of separate O 2p and Cr 3d states that
   would impact PEC but not PC behaviour.}},

Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Coupling of mechanical forces and chemical transformations is central to
   the biophysics of molecular machines, polymer chemistry, fracture
   mechanics, tribology, and other disciplines. As a consequence, the same
   physical principles and theoretical models should be applicable in all
   of those fields; in fact, similar models have been invoked (and often
   repeatedly reinvented) to describe, for example, cell adhesion, dry and
   wet friction, propagation of cracks, and action of molecular motors.
   This perspective offers a unified view of these phenomena, described in
   terms of chemical kinetics with rates of elementary steps that are force
   dependent. The central question is then to describe how the rate of a
   chemical transformation (and its other measurable properties such as the
   transition path) depends on the applied force. I will describe physical
   models used to answer this question and compare them with experimental
   measurements, which employ single-molecule force spectroscopy and which
   become increasingly common. Multidimensionality of the underlying
   molecular energy landscapes and the ensuing frequent misalignment
   between chemical and mechanical coordinates result in a number of
   distinct scenarios, each showing a nontrivial force dependence of the
   reaction rate. I will discuss these scenarios, their commonness (or its
   lack), and the prospects for their experimental validation. Finally, I
   will discuss open issues in the field. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   to a voltage-triggered mechanism. The program window has been optimized
   for program/erase disturbance immunity and reliability for circuit-level
   applications. The SET and RESET transitions have also been characterized
   using a dynamic conductivity method, which distinguishes the
   self-compliance behavior due to an internal series resistance effect
   (filament) in SiOx-based RS memory. By using a conceptual
   ``filament/resistive gap (GAP){''} model of the conductive filament and
   a proton exchange model with appropriate assumptions, the internal
   filament resistance and GAP resistance can be estimated for high-and
   low-resistance states (HRS and LRS), and are found to be independent of
   external series resistance. Our experimental results not only provide
   insights into potential reliability issues but also help to clarify the
   switching mechanisms and device operating characteristics of SiOx-based
   RS memory. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Natural and induced fractures in coal cores imaged through X-ray

Abstract = {{Fractures are important in tight formations because they can constitute
   major paths for fluid flow and increase drainage surface area in oil and
   gas systems. The natural heterogeneity of subsurface formations is
   largely simplified or homogenized in practical applications. However,
   detailed rock characterization of natural discontinuities and planes of
   weakness can play a decisive role in judging fracture-matrix interaction
   and the effective properties of tight reservoir formations. We show the
   results of X-ray microtomography on coal cores with natural and induced
   fractures accompanied by digital image analyses for fracture
   discretization and numerical simulation of compressible fluid flow from
   an adsorptive medium to discrete fractures. Reconstructed tomographic
   images provide evidence of a complex network of open and mineralized
   fractures that interacts with induced shear fractures. Mineralized veins
   occupy from zero to up to 6\% volume fraction in some bedding layers.
   Open fracture porosity is generally lower than 1\% except upon shear and
   dilation. Natural fracture patterns can drastically change in less than
   1 cm in direction perpendicular to bedding indicating strong lamination.
   X-ray microscopy can help assess brittleness during failure, the role of
   preexistent fracture tips on induced fractures, and potential for fines
   production. Digital image analysis based on the Hough transform yields
   meaningful results locating and characterizing a large number of
   fractures automatically along the core. Numerical simulation results
   show that desorption times can be more than two orders of magnitude
   faster in fractured coal than in the intact coal matrix. The use of
   tracers helps observe and model fluid flow and uptake in fracture-matrix
   systems. Altogether, combined X-ray tomography, image processing, and
   numerical simulation help visualize and quantify the complexity and
   heterogeneity of naturally fractured geological samples in views of
   applications to integrated reservoir petrophysical and geomechanical
   characterization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{As anticancer therapies designed to target specific molecular pathways
   have been developed, it has become critical to develop methods to assess
   the response induced by such agents. Although traditional, anatomic CT,
   and MRI examinations are useful in many settings, increasing evidence
   suggests that these methods cannot answer the fundamental biologic and
   physiologic questions essential for assessment and, eventually,
   prediction of treatment response in the clinical trial setting,
   especially in the critical period soon after treatment is initiated. To
   optimally apply advances in quantitative imaging methods to trials of
   targeted cancer therapy, new infrastructure improvements are needed that
   incorporate these emerging techniques into the settings where they are
   most likely to have impact. In this review, we first elucidate the needs
   for therapeutic response assessment in the era of molecularly targeted
   therapy and describe how quantitative imaging can most effectively
   provide scientifically and clinically relevant data. We then describe
   the tools and methods required to apply quantitative imaging and provide
   concrete examples of work making these advances practically available
   for routine application in clinical trials. We conclude by proposing
   strategies to surmount barriers to wider incorporation of these
   quantitative imaging methods into clinical trials and, eventually,
   clinical practice. Our goal is to encourage and guide the oncology
   community to deploy standardized quantitative imaging techniques in
   clinical trials to further personalize care for cancer patients and to
   provide a more efficient path for the development of improved targeted
   therapies. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Title = {{Gas permeation and mechanical properties of thermally rearranged (TR)
   copolyimides}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{378-391}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Gas transport and mechanical properties are reported for a series of
   copolyimides and their corresponding thermally rearranged (TR) analogs.
   Random copolyimides of APAF/HAB-6FDA with various compositions were
   synthesized via chemical imidization from 2,2'-bis
   (3-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl)-hexafluoropropane (APAF),
   3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (HAB), and
   2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA).
   These copolyimides were thermally treated at temperatures between 350
   degrees C and 450 degrees C to prepare TR polybenzoxazoles (PBOs). Pure
   gas permeabilities of H-2, CH4, N-2, O-2, and CO2 were measured at 35
   degrees C with upstream pressures ranging from 3 to 17 atm. In general,
   gas permeability increased and selectivity decreased as TR conversion
   increased. Gas permeability also increased with increasing APAF content
   in the polyimides as a result of higher fractional free volume (FFV)
   imparted by the extra hexafluoroisopropylidene group in APAF.
   Stressestrain relationships were recorded for the polyimides and their
   TR analogs. As polyimides underwent thermal rearrangement, samples
   became more rigid, and tensile stress and elongation at break decreased.
   A similar trend in mechanical properties was also observed as APAF
   content increased, which was attributed to the lower molecular weight of
   APAF-containing polymers, resulting from the lower reactivity of APAF
   relative to that of HAB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrene end-functionalized, telechelic poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS)
   materials were synthesized and their response to different thermal
   stimuli was evaluated. The incorporation of pyrene end groups introduces
   strong pi-pi interactions that facilitated a broad range of thermally
   responsive properties, in some circumstances forming pyrene nanocrystals
   that serve as physical crosslinks leading to elastic materials. By
   synthesizing different chain lengths, samples exhibiting a 7 orders of
   magnitude change in storage modulus in response to thermal stimuli were
   produced by modifying only the end-groups (0.6 wt \% of all polymer
   segments). Repeated thermal cycling during rheological experiments
   revealed that pi-pi interaction and crystallization/melting kinetics of
   pyrene chain-ends plays a key role in their thermal responsiveness. The
   properties of these materials were tuned by adding free pyrene, neat
   PDMS, or graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles, making them attractive for
   many applications (e.g., tunable damping materials, heat/light sensors,
   conductive gels, or light repositionable adhesives). For example,
   nanocomposites containing 1 wt \% GO caused the melting temperature for
   pyrene crystal domains to more than double, and even induced pyrene
   end-group crystallization in samples that did not exhibit crystals in
   neat form. It is hypothesized that these features originate from pi-pi
   interactions between pyrene ends and GO surfaces. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Aqueous dispersions of iron oxide nanoparticles with a high initial
   magnetic susceptibility (xi) are of interest as contrast agents in
   electromagnetic tomography. Nanoclusters composed of iron oxide primary
   particles were formed by co-precipitation of Fe(II) and Fe(III)
   chlorides at alkaline conditions and high temperature of 95 degrees C.
   Two-step addition of citrate was used to produce large primary particles
   and then stabilize the nanoclusters. The size of the primary particles
   was tuned from 5 nm to 15 nm by varying the citrate/iron precursor ratio
   during the normal phase hydrolysis reaction, while the second iteration
   of citrate stabilized the nanoclusters with hydrodynamic diameters of
   30-75 nm. The crystallinity of the iron oxide nanoparticles was promoted
   by annealing at 95 degrees C and systematically studied with
   Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID), Vibrating Sample
   Magnetometer (VSM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray
   Diffraction (XRD). The dependence of xi was examined over a range of low
   volume fractions (0.005 < 0 < 0.02) to understand the magnetic behavior
   of dispersions. The xi of the dispersions increased markedly with the
   size and concentration of the constituent primary particles, reaching an
   unusually high value of 0.85 at 1.6\% v/v for 15 nm primary particles,
   which is 2-3 times higher than that for typical commercial ferrofluids.
   The high chi(i) values are favored by the high crystallinity and the
   large magnetic diameter of 9.3 nm, indicating a relatively thin surface
   nonmagnetic layer where the spin orientations are disordered. (C) 2015

Title = {{ASP flood of a viscous oil in a carbonate rock}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{18-27}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to develop an alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP)
   formulation for a viscous oil (105 cP at the reservoir temperature) and
   compare secondary and tertiary ASP floods. Phase behavior studies were
   performed to find an ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) ASP formulation
   for the viscous oil. Static surfactant adsorption experiments were
   performed to compare the effectiveness of different alkalis in reducing
   adsorption. The surfactant formulation was tested with an outcrop vuggy
   dolomite core in both tertiary and secondary modes. Lab coreflood
   results were modeled in UTCHEM which used EQBATCH to model sodium
   metaborate geochemical reactions in a carbonate rock. Sodium carbonate
   and sodium metaborate were both found to be equally effective in
   reducing surfactant adsorption on crushed dolomite. Waterflood recovered
   about 47.8\% of the oil in place and reduced the oil saturation to
   43.8\%. The tertiary surfactant flood increased the cumulative oil
   recovery to 92.7\% whereby the oil saturation was reduced to 6.1\%. The
   secondary surfactant flood was even more effective than the tertiary;
   the oil saturation was reduced to 3.1\% and the oil recovery was 95.6\%
   OOIP. Very low surfactant retention was observed in the ASP corefloods.
   UTCHEM simulations showed a reasonable match with the experimental
   results. Experimental data for surfactant phase behavior, polymer
   viscosity, and surfactant adsorption were critical in modeling the
   experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Elemental sulfur electrode has a huge advantage in terms of
   charge-storage capacity. However, the lack of electrical conductivity
   results in poor electrochemical utilization of sulfur and performance.
   This problem has been overcome to some extent previously by using a bare
   multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) paper interlayer between the sulfur
   cathode and the polymeric separator, resulting in good electron
   transport and adsorption of dissolved polysulfides. To advance the
   interlayer concept further, we present here a self-assembled MWCNT
   interlayer fabricated by a facile, low-cost process. The LiS cells
   fabricated with the self-assembled MWCNT interlayer and a high loading
   of 3 mg cm(-2) sulfur exhibit a first discharge specific capacity of
   1112 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C rate and retain 95.8\% of the capacity at 0.5 C
   rate after 100 cycles as the self-assembled MWCNT interlayer facilitates
   good interfacial contact between the interlayer and the sulfur cathode
   and fast electron and lithium-ion transport while trapping and
   reutilizing the migrating polysulfides. The approach presented here has
   the potential to advance the commercialization feasibility of the LiS
   batteries.}},

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal evolution of a magnetically driven arc in a rail
   plasma flow actuator has been characterized with high-speed imaging,
   electrical measurements, and spectroscopy. The arc draws a peak current
   of similar to 1 kA. High-speed framing cameras were used to observe the
   complex arc propagation phenomenon. In particular, the anode and cathode
   roots were observed to have different modes of transit, which resulted
   in distinct types of electrode degradation on the anode and cathode
   surfaces. Observations of the arc electrical properties and induced
   magnetic fields are used to explain the transit mechanism of the arc.
   Emission spectroscopy revealed the arc temperature and species
   composition as a function of transit distance of the arc. The results
   obtained offer significant insights into the electromagnetic properties
   of the arc-rail system as well as arc-surface interaction phenomena in a
   propagating arc.}},

Abstract = {{For foams with ultra low water contents, the capillary pressure is very
   large and induces rapid drainage that destabilizes the aqueous lamellae
   between the gas bubbles. However, we show that high-pressure
   CO2-in-water foams can be stabilized with a viscoelastic aqueous phase
   composed of entangled wormlike micelles, even for extremely high CO2,
   volume fractions phi of 0.95 to 0.98; the viscosity of these ultradry
   foams increased by up to 3-4-fold, reaching more than 100 cP relative to
   foams formed with conventional low viscosity aqueous phases. The foam
   morphology consisted of fine similar to 20 mu m polyhedral-shaped CO2,
   bubbles that were stable for hours. The wormlike micelles were formed by
   mixing anionic sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) with salt and a
   protonated cationic surfactant, as shown by cryogenic transmission
   electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and large values of the zero-shear
   viscosity and the dynamic storage and loss moduli. With the highly
   viscous continuous aqueous phases, the foam lamella drainage rates were
   low, as corroborated by confocal microscopy. The preservation of viscous
   thick lamellae resulted in lower rates of Ostwald ripening relative to
   conventional foams as shown by high-pressure optical microscopy. The
   ability to stabilize viscous ultra high internal phase foams is expected
   to find utility in various practical applications, including nearly
   ``waterless{''} fracturing fluids for recovery of oil and gas in shale,
   offering the possibility of a massive reduction in the amount of
   wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{Use of block copolymer thin films in lithographic applications requires
   orientation of domains perpendicular to a substrate. Algebraic models
   were used to predict conditions that are favorable for perpendicular
   versus parallel domain orientation in films confined between two
   interfaces. The free energy of each orientation was evaluated, yielding
   response surface plots as a function of film thickness and the
   preferential interaction strength at each interface. The model predicts
   that perpendicular orientation is generally favored for thinner films
   and at thicknesses incommensurate with the bulk periodicity, L-0. If
   either the top or bottom interfaces are preferential for one block, the
   favorable thickness windows shift depending on the interface wetting
   behavior. An extensive body of thin film experimental work corroborated
   the analytical predictions. The algebraic model has predictive value,
   and it demonstrates the complexity of the dependence of block copolymer
   orientation on the wetting behavior of the interfaces and the film
   thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Replacing platinum as an oxygen reduction catalyst is an important
   scientific and technological challenge. Herein we report a simple
   synthesis of a complex carbon with very good oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) activity at pH 13. Pyrolysis of magnesium nitrilotriacetate yields
   a carbon with hierarchical micro/meso/macro porosity, resulting from in
   situ templating by spontaneously forming MgO nanoparticles and from
   etching by pyrolysis gases. The mesopores are lined with highly
   graphitic shells. The high ORR activity is attributed to a good balance
   between high specific surface area and mass transport through the
   hierarchical porosity, and to improved electronic conductivity through
   the graphitic shells. This novel carbon has a high surface area (1320
   m(2)g(-1)), and high nitrogen content for a single precursor synthesis
   (similar to 6\%). Importantly, its synthesis is both cheap and easily
   scalable.}},

Title = {{pH-responsive and enzymatically-responsive hydrogel microparticles for
   the oral delivery of therapeutic proteins: Effects of protein size,
   crosslinking density, and hydrogel degradation on protein delivery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{221}},
Pages = {{18-25}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Two potential platform technologies for the oral delivery of protein
   therapeutics were synthesized and tested. pH-responsive poly(itaconic
   acid-co-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (P(IA-co-NVP)) hydrogel microparticles
   were tested in vitro with model proteins salmon calcitonin, urokinase,
   and rituximab to determine the effects of particle size, protein size,
   and crosslinking density on oral delivery capability. Particle size
   showed no significant effect on overall delivery potential but did
   improve percent release of encapsulated protein over the micro-scale
   particle size range studied. Protein size was shown to have a
   significant impact on the delivery capability of the P(IA-co-NVP)
   hydrogel. We show that when using P(IA-co-NVP) hydrogel microparticles
   with 3 mol\% tetra(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate crosslinker, a small
   polypeptide (salmon calcitonin) loads and releases up to 45 mu g/mg
   hydrogel while the mid-sized protein urokinase and large monoclonal
   antibody rituximab load and release only 19 and 24 mu g/mg hydrogel,
   respectively. We further demonstrate that crosslinking density offers a
   simple method for tuning hydrogel properties to variously sized
   proteins. Using 5 mol\% TEGDMA crosslinker offers optimal performance
   for the small peptide, salmon calcitonin, whereas lower crosslinking
   density of 1 mol\% offers optimal performance for the much larger
   protein rituximab. Finally, an enzymatically-degradable hydrogels of
   P(MAA-co-NVP) crosslinked with the peptide sequence MMRRRKK were
   synthesized and tested in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions.
   These hydrogels offer ideal loading and release behavior, showing no
   degradative release of encapsulated salmon calcitonin in gastric
   conditions while yielding rapid and complete release of encapsulated
   protein within 1 h in intestinal conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Analytic dynamical corrections to transition state theory}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{We present a theory of reaction kinetics that accurately accounts for
   recrossing effect at the transition state. Using perturbation theory we
   solve the equations of motion in the neighborhood of the transition
   state and derive a simple condition that determines whether a trajectory
   is truly reactive or not. We apply our theory to adatom diffusion on an
   aluminum surface and show that our analytical results compare well with
   those of a direct dynamical simulation. Our theory gives us a better
   understanding of the limitations of transition state theory and a simple
   analytic formula for quantifying the recrossing effects.}},

Abstract = {{The Gorkha earthquake (magnitude 7.8) on 25 April 2015 and later
   aftershocks struck South Asia, killing similar to 9000 people and
   damaging a large region. Supported by a large campaign of responsive
   satellite data acquisitions over the earthquake disaster zone, our team
   undertook a satellite image survey of the earthquakes' induced
   geohazards in Nepal and China and an assessment of the geomorphic,
   tectonic, and lithologic controls on quake-induced landslides. Timely
   analysis and communication aided response and recovery and informed
   decision-makers. We mapped 4312 coseismic and postseismic landslides. We
   also surveyed 491 glacier lakes for earthquake damage but found only
   nine landslide-impacted lakes and no visible satellite evidence of
   outbursts. Landslide densities correlate with slope, peak ground
   acceleration, surface downdrop, and specific metamorphic lithologies and
   large plutonic intrusions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel nanocomposite cathode consisting of sulfur and hollow-mesoporous
   titania (HMT) embedded within carbon nanotubes (CNT), which is
   designated as S-HMT@CNT, has been obtained by encapsulating elemental
   sulfur into the pores of hollow-mesoporous, spherical TiO2 particles
   that are connected via CNT. A carbon-paper interlayer, referred to as
   dual functional porous carbon wall (DF-PCW), has been obtained by
   filling the voids in TiO2 spheres with carbon and then etching the TiO2
   template with a chemical process. The DF-PCW interlayer provides a
   medium for scavenging the lithium polysulfides and suppressing them from
   diffusing to the anode side when it is inserted between the sulfur
   cathode and the separator. Lithium-sulfur cells fabricated with the thus
   prepared S-HMT@CNT cathode and the DF-PCW interlayer exhibit superior
   performance due to the containment of sulfur in TiO2 and improved
   lithium-ion and electron transports. The Li-S cells display high
   capacity with excellent capacity retention at rates as high as 1C, 2C,
   and 5C rates.}},

Abstract = {{Ni-rich layered oxides and Li-rich layered oxides are topics of much
   research interest as cathodes for Li-ion batteries due to their low cost
   and higher discharge capacities compared to those of LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4.
   However, Ni-rich layered oxides have several pitfalls, including
   difficulty in synthesizing a well-ordered material with all Ni3+ ions,
   poor cyclability, moisture sensitivity, a thermal runaway reaction, and
   formation of a harmful surface layer caused by side reactions with the
   electrolyte. Recent efforts towards Ni-rich layered oxides have centered
   on optimizing the composition and processing conditions to obtain
   controlled bulk and surface compositions to overcome the capacity fade.
   Li-rich layered oxides also have negative aspects, including oxygen loss
   from the lattice during first charge, a large first cycle irreversible
   capacity loss, poor rate capability, side reactions with the
   electrolyte, low tap density, and voltage decay during extended cycling.
   Recent work on Li-rich layered oxides has focused on understanding the
   surface and bulk structures and eliminating the undesirable properties.
   Followed by a brief introduction, an account of recent developments on
   the understanding and performance gains of Ni-rich and Li-rich layered
   oxide cathodes is provided, along with future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{A practical, low-cost synthesis of hollow mesoporous organic polymer
   (HMOP) spheres is reported. The electrochemical properties of
   Li+/Na+-electrolyte membranes with these spheres substituting for oxide
   filler particles in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-filler composite are
   explored. The electrolyte membranes are mechanically robust, thermally
   stable to over 250 degrees C, and block dendrites from a
   metallic-lithium/sodium anode. The Li+/Na+ transfer impedance across the
   lithium/sodium-electrolyte interface is initially acceptable at 65
   degrees C and scavenging of impurities by the porous-spheres filler
   lowers this impedance relative to that with Al2O3. All-solid-state
   Li/LiFePO4 and Na/NaTi2(PO4)(3) cells give stable discharge capacity of
   approximate to 130 and 80 mAh g(-1), respectively, at 0.5 C and 65

   liquid-volume monitoring}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous liquid-volume monitoring is crucial in ubiquitous healthcare.
   However, conventional approach is based on either human visual
   observation or expensive detectors, which are costly for future
   pervasive monitoring. Here we introduce a novel approach based on
   passive harmonic transponder antenna sensor and frequency hopping spread
   spectrum (FHSS) pattern analysis, to provide a very low cost wireless mu
   L-resolution liquid-volume monitoring without battery or digital
   circuits. In our conceptual demonstration, the harmonic transponder
   comprises of a passive nonlinear frequency multiplier connected to a
   metamaterial-inspired 3-D antenna designed to be highly sensitive to the
   liquid-volume within a confined region. The transponder first receives
   some FHSS signal from an interrogator, then converts such signal to its
   harmonic band and re-radiates through the antenna sensor. The harmonic
   signal is picked up by a sniffer receiver and decoded through pattern
   analysis of the high dimensional FHSS signal strength data. A robust,
   zero power, absolute accuracy wireless liquid-volume monitoring is
   realized in the presence of strong direct coupling, background scatters,
   distance variance as well as near-field human-body interference. The
   concepts of passive harmonic transponder sensor, metamaterial-inspired
   antenna sensor, and FHSS pattern analysis based sensor decoding may help
   establishing cost-effective, energy-efficient and intelligent wireless
   pervasive healthcare monitoring platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to ambient air pollution is a major risk factor for global
   disease. Assessment of the impacts of air pollution on population health
   and evaluation of trends relative to other major risk factors requires
   regularly updated, accurate, spatially resolved exposure estimates. We
   combined satellite-based estimates, chemical transport model
   simulations, and ground measurements from 79 different countries to
   produce global estimates of annual average fine particle (PM2.5) and
   ozone concentrations at 0.1 degrees X 0.1 degrees spatial resolution for
   five-year intervals from 1990 to 2010 and the year 2013. These estimates
   were applied to assess population-weighted mean concentrations for
   1990-2013 for each of 188 countries. In 2013, 87\% of the world's
   population lived in areas exceeding the World Health Organization Air
   Quality Guideline of 10 mu g/m(3) PM2.5 (annual average). Between 1990
   and 2013, global population-weighted PM2.5 increased by 20.4\% driven by
   trends in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China. Decreases in
   population-weighted mean concentrations of PM2.5 were evident in most
   high income countries. Population-weighted mean concentrations of ozone
   increased globally by 8.9\% from 1990-2013 with increases in most
   countries-except for modest decreases in North America, parts of Europe,
   and several countries in Southeast Asia.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a novel application of an inspection game to find
   optimally efficient nuclear safeguard strategies. It describes a
   methodology that allocates resources at and across nuclear fuel cycle
   facilities for a cost-constrained inspectorate seeking to detect a
   state-facilitated diversion or misuse. The methodology couples a
   simultaneous-play game theoretic solver with a probabilistic model for
   simulating state violation scenarios at a gas centrifuge enrichment
   plant. The simulation model features a suite of defender options based
   on current International Atomic Energy Agency practices and an analogous
   menu of attacker proliferation pathway options. The simulation informs
   the game theoretic solver by calculating the detection probability for a
   given inspector-proliferator strategy pair. To generate a scenario
   payoff, it weights the detection probability by the quantity and quality
   of material obtained. Using a modified fictitious play algorithm, the
   game iteratively calls the simulation model until Nash equilibrium is
   reached and outputs the optimal inspection and proliferation strategies.
   The value the attacker places on material quantity and quality is varied
   to generate results representative of states with different capabilities
   and goals. Sample model results are shown to illustrate the sensitivity
   of defender and attacker strategy to attacker characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuser selection guidance listed in ASHRAE HandbookFundamentals
   (ASHRAE 2009b) includes Air Diffusion Performance Index values for
   horizontal high sidewall grills and ceiling linear slot diffusers.
   However, grills are adjustable at various angles, which generate
   different airflow patterns in a space and therefore might greatly affect
   Air Diffusion Performance Index values. Also, complaints of draft
   generated by ceiling slot diffusers are common because of inappropriate
   adjustment of diffuser deflectors. This study measures the Air Diffusion
   Performance Index values of three widely used adjustable
   diffusersadjustable-blade grills, fixed-blade grills, and ceiling linear
   slot diffusersat various deflector configurations in a test room with
   25- and 50-W/m(2) (7.9- and 15.8-Btu/hr/ft(2)) cooling loads. The study
   explores how deflector adjustments affect diffusers, with performance
   represented by Air Diffusion Performance Index values. The results show
   that upward blade deflectors can increase Air Diffusion Performance
   Index values greatly for blade grills. In general, downward jets reduce
   Air Diffusion Performance Index values for each adjustable diffuser type
   operating at cooling conditions. A smoke test can assist in the
   adjustment of linear slot diffusers to create the desired

Abstract = {{In this chapter we summarize a recently proposed immersogeometric method
   for the simulation of incompressible flow around geometrically complex
   objects. The method immerses the objects into unfitted tetrahedral
   finite elements meshes and weakly enforces Dirichlet boundary conditions
   on the surfaces of the objects. Adaptively refined quadrature rules are
   used to faithfully capture the flow domain geometry in the discrete
   problem without modifying the unfitted finite element mesh. A
   variational multiscale formulation which provides accuracy and
   robustness in both laminar and turbulent flow conditions is employed. We
   assess the accuracy of the method by analyzing the flow around an
   immersed sphere for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We show that flow
   quantities of interest are in very good agreement with reference values
   obtained from standard boundary-fitted approaches. Our results also show
   that the faithful representation of the geometry in intersected elements
   is critical for accurate flow analysis. We demonstrate the potential of
   our proposed method for high-fidelity industrial scale simulations by
   performing an aerodynamic analysis of a full-scale agricultural tractor.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we consider the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations, a
   diffuse-interface model describing liquid-vapor phase transitions. A
   numerical scheme for this model is constructed based on functional
   entropy variables and a new time integration concept. The fully discrete
   scheme is unconditionally stable in entropy and second-order
   time-accurate. Isogeometric analysis is utilized for spatial
   discretization. The boiling problem is numerically investigated by
   making proper assumptions on transport parameters and boundary
   conditions. Compared with traditional multiphase solvers, the dependence
   on empirical data is significantly reduced, and this modeling approach
   provides a unified predictive tool for both nucleate and film boiling.
   Both two-and three-dimensional simulation results are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater images suffer from severe perceptual/ visual degradation, due
   to the dense and non-uniform medium, causing scattering and attenuation
   of the propagated light that is sensed. Typical restoration methods rely
   on the popular Dark Channel Prior to estimate the light attenuation
   factor, and subtract the back-scattered light influence to invert the
   underwater imaging model. However, as a consequence of using approximate
   and global estimates of the back-scattered light, most existing
   single-image underwater descattering techniques perform poorly when
   restoring non-uniformly illuminated scenes. To mitigate this problem, we
   introduce a novel approach that estimates the back-scattered light
   locally, based on the observation of a neighborhood around the pixel of
   interest. To circumvent issue related to selection of the neighborhood
   size, we propose to fuse the images obtained over both small and large
   neighborhoods, each capturing distinct features from the input image. In
   addition, the Laplacian of the original image is provided as a third
   input to the fusion process, to enhance texture details in the
   reconstructed image. These three derived inputs are seamlessly blended
   via a multi-scale fusion approach, using saliency, contrast, and
   saturation metrics to weight each input. We perform an extensive
   qualitative and quantitative evaluation against several specialized
   techniques. In addition to its simplicity, our method outperforms the
   previous art on extreme underwater cases of artificial ambient
   illumination and high water turbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Commonplace in oceanography is the collection of ocean drifter
   positions. Ocean drifters are devices that sit on the surface of the
   ocean and move with the flow, transmitting their position via GPS to
   stations on land. Using drifter data, it is possible to obtain a
   posterior on the underlying flow. This problem, however, is highly
   underdetermined. Through controlling an ocean drifter, we attempt to
   improve our knowledge of the underlying flow. We do this by instructing
   the drifter to explore parts of the flow currently uncharted, thereby
   obtaining fresh observations. The efficacy of a control is determined by
   its effect on the variance of the posterior distribution. A smaller
   variance is interpreted as a better understanding of the flow. We show
   that a systematic reduction in variance can be achieved by utilising
   controls that allow the drifter to navigate new or interesting flow
   structures, a good example of which are eddies.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing using simple logic circuits requires significantly
   less area and consumes less power compared to traditional computing
   systems. These circuits are also inherently fault-tolerant. The main
   drawbacks of these systems include long latency and inexactness in
   computing. The deviation from exact values increases as the correlation
   among inputs increases. In many applications, outputs from different
   sensors may be correlated. Thus, testing correctness of stochastic
   computing circuits requires generation of correlated stochastic bit
   streams. While uncorrelated bit streams can be generated using linear
   feedback shift registers (LFSRs), generation of correlated stochastic
   bit streams has not yet been fully investigated. This paper presents a
   general approach to synthesize correlated stochastic bit streams for
   specified probabilities and specified correlation coefficients.
   Generation of N correlated stochastic bit streams requires N
   probabilities and 2 N-N-1 correlation coefficients. Using N LFSRs, N
   uncorrelated stochastic bit streams are first generated. The N
   correlated bit streams are then generated one at a time using
   conditional marginal probabilities. The method is illustrated for
   generating two and three correlated bit streams. The area and power
   overheads for two correlated bit streams are 9.09\% and 2.12\%,
   respectively, and for three correlated bit streams are 21.03\% and
   4.80\%, respectively. The generated sequences are applied to simple
   stochastic logic gates and the probability density functions (pdfs) of
   the outputs are derived. It is shown that these match with the
   theoretical pdfs of the outputs.}},

   dynamic range (HDR) images which are usually created from multiple
   exposures of the same scene, can provide 16 or 32 bits/color/pixel, but
   must be tonemapped to SDR for display on standard monitors.
   Multiexposure fusion (MEF) techniques bypass HDR creation, by fusing the
   exposure stack directly to SDR format while aiming for aesthetically
   pleasing luminance and color distributions. Here we describe a new
   no-reference image quality assessment (NR IQA) model for HDR pictures
   that is based on standard measurements of the bandpass and on
   newly-conceived differential natural scene statistics (NSS) of HDR
   pictures. We derive an algorithm from the model which we call the
   Gradient Image Quality Assessment algorithm (G-IQA). NSS models have
   previously been used to devise NR IQA models that effectively predict
   the subjective quality of SDR images, but they perform significantly
   worse on tonemapped HDR content. Towards ameliorating this we make here
   the following contributions: (1) We design a HDR picture NR IQA model
   and algorithm using both standard space-domain NSS features as well as
   novel HDR-specific gradient based features that significantly elevate
   prediction performance, (2) We validate the proposed models on a
   large-scale crowdsourced HDR image database, and (3) We demonstrate that
   the proposed model also perform well on legacy natural SDR images. The

Abstract = {{Oxide based resistive switching memory (ReRAM or RRAM) is a class of
   promising candidates for future non-volatile memory due to its fast
   programing, low power operation, and scalability. Among them, SiOx
   single layer resistive switching (RS) devices have been widely studied
   and characterized. The SiOx single layer resistive memory has excellent
   compatibility to CMOS fabrication process. However, it can only be
   programmed under vacuum or non-oxidized ambient. Also, previous results
   reported on SiOx-based memristors indicate that the electroforming and
   programming voltages are relatively high, especially for low-power
   applications. In this work, by using SiOx/HfOx stacked structures, we
   have developed a low-voltage operation (< 2V) for SiOx-based ReRAM. The
   results show that with HfOx (3nm) on bottom, the
   metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures exhibit resistive
   switching at low voltage (< 2V) and operation in air atmosphere. The
   added hafnium layer is believed to provide a source to proton exchange
   reaction with conduction bandgap offset reduction for low-voltage (< 2V)
   RS. Furthermore, we have studied single HfOx-based MIS devices which
   exhibit bipolar-type resistive switching behaviors with small memory
   window. Clearly, SiOx/HfOx stacking optimization not only maintains the
   RS behaviors even in air environment without any programming window
   degradation, but also reduces the switching voltage below 2V.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{30-36}},
Abstract = {{During the operation of a geological carbon storage project, verifying
   that the CO2 plume remains within the permitted zone will be of
   particular interest both to regulators and operators. A model selection
   algorithm was developed, which refines an initial suite of subsurface
   models representing the prior uncertainty to create a posterior set of
   subsurface models that reflect injection performance consistent with
   that observed. Such posterior models can be used to represent
   uncertainty in the future migration of the CO2 plume. The method
   provides a very inexpensive alternative to map the migration of the
   plume and the associated uncertainty in migration paths due to the fact
   that only injection data is required. An essential aspect of the model
   selection algorithm is to group prior models on the basis of their
   connectivity. The base algorithm assesses that connectivity using a
   physical proxy such as a random walker. An alternate approach would be
   to use statistical tools for assessing connectivity of models. In this
   paper, we present an approach to compute the shortest connected path
   between well locations in an aquifer model and to define a measure of
   similarity of shape based on the concept of a discrete Frechet distance.}},

   establish the theoretical feasibility of uncoordinated sharing by
   considering a downlink system containing multiple mmWave cellular

   against systems with exclusive licenses. We show that shared licenses
   can use a smaller bandwidth to achieve the same per-user median rate as
   providers with an exclusive spectrum license. We also show that both
   total interference and available bandwidth increase with the size of the
   spectrum sharing coalition, which implies that the optimal amount of
   spectrum sharing depends on the target rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a method for the construction of consistently
   improving inner and outer approximate poly topic sets for
   controllability and reachability under constraints. Sequences of
   consistently improving approximate polytopic sets are obtained from the
   solution of a series of Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problems.
   Notable advances in reliability and speed of recent SOCP solvers render
   the proposed procedure computationally attractive, since the solutions
   to frequently encountered SOCPs are computable in tens of milliseconds
   or less. The initialization of the previous algorithm is enhanced by
   means of a simultaneous computation of an optimized pair of inner and
   outer bounding simplices. The Hausdorff distance is employed as a
   criteria for the growth of the inner and outer approximate polytopic
   sets as well as a topologically suitable metric for convergence. The
   algorithm yields polytopes that inner and outer approximate exact
   Controllable/Reachable (C/R) set to a desired precision w.r.t. the
   Hausdorff distance. The relevance and value of the proposed procedure
   are demonstrated by its application to a fully constrained Mars
   planetary landing problem.}},

   Conventional wisdom: it inherently requires substantial workspace. Our

   wisdom: a Strassen DGEMM interface must pass in workspace. Our
   implementation requires no such workspace and can be plug-compatible

Abstract = {{We present a parallel distributed-memory algorithm for large deformation
   diffeomorphic registration of volumetric images that produces large
   isochoric deformations (locally volume preserving). Image registration
   is a key technology in medical image analysis. Our algorithm uses a
   partial differential equation constrained optimal control formulation.
   Finding the optimal deformation map requires the solution of a highly
   nonlinear problem that involves pseudo-differential operators,
   biharmonic operators, and pure advection operators both forward and
   backward in time. A key issue is the time to solution, which poses the
   demand for efficient optimization methods as well as an effective
   utilization of high performance computing resources. To address this
   problem we use a preconditioned, inexact, Gauss-NewtonKrylov solver. Our
   algorithm integrates several components: a spectral discretization in
   space, a semi-Lagrangian formulation in time, analytic adjoints,
   different regularization functionals (including volume-preserving ones),
   a spectral preconditioner, a highly optimized distributed Fast Fourier
   Transform, and a cubic interpolation scheme for the semi-Lagrangian
   time-stepping. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm on images
   with resolution of up to 1024(3) on the ``Maverick{''} and
   ``Stampede{''} systems at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).
   The critical problem in the medical imaging application domain is strong
   scaling, that is, solving registration problems of a moderate size of
   256(3)-a typical resolution for medical images. We are able to solve the
   registration problem for images of this size in less than five seconds
   on 64 x86 nodes of TACC's ``Maverick{''} system.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce two robust DPG methods for transient convection-diffusion
   problems. Once a variational formulation is selected, the choice of test
   norm critically influences the quality of a particular DPG method. It is
   desirable that a test norm produce convergence of the solution in a norm
   equivalent to L-2 while producing optimal test functions that can be
   accurately computed and maintaining good conditioning of the optimal
   test function solve on highly adaptive meshes. Two such robust norms are
   introduced and proven to guarantee close to L-2 convergence of the
   primary solution variable. Numerical experiments demonstrate robust
   convergence of the two methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents hardware experimental results for the use of a
   recently formulated angular velocity estimation algorithm. The main
   motivation for the use of this algorithm comes from the possibility of
   estimating angular velocity with use of estimated quaternions for a
   system whose attitude is progressively changing with time. The
   innovation on the estimation algorithm resides on the fact that it tries
   to be adaptive when determining the direction of the axis of rotation.
   It uses a sliding window whose size changes with time so as to use more
   or fewer past measurements when estimating the unknown angular rate. In
   order to test the effectiveness of the algorithm, an experimental setup
   was prepared in the Autonomous GN\&C research laboratory of The
   University of Texas at Austin. The experimental setup used equipment to
   be able to accurately measure the real angular velocity of a rotating
   system, so that noisy attitude measurements could be used as input to
   the algorithm and the results would be consistently compared to some
   ``credible truth{''}. For the sake of algorithm comparison, this paper
   compares the results of the estimation algorithm with a simpler solution
   obtained through Pure Derivative altogether with the Quaternion
   Kinematics Equation (PDQKE). The final results suggest that the studied
   algorithm is mostly beneficial compared to the PDQKE when
   higher-variance noise is present in the quaternion measurement vector.}},

Abstract = {{Preliminary design of low-thrust trajectories generally benefits from
   broad searches over the feasible space. Despite convergence issues,
   indirect methods are generally faster than direct methods, and therefore
   well-suited for such searches. Nonetheless, indirect solutions typically
   require expensive numerical integration of at least the state and
   costate equations. Here, based on the physical interpretation of the
   primer vector, a fast model that approximates solutions to all the
   dynamics is introduced. If the ballistic dynamics have a closed form
   solution, then the costate equations can be approximated without
   resorting to numerical integration. Analogous to the Sims-Flanagan model
   for direct optimization, the new model approximates thrust arcs with a
   series of ballistic arcs and impulsive maneuvers. The closed form
   solution is obtained using a Sundman-transformed independent variable,
   which also provides an efficient discretization. Furthermore, a low
   order series solution is used for the ballistic propagation. The model
   is introduced and evaluated for speed and accuracy using examples with
   Keplerian dynamics. Speedups vary according to thrust and discretization
   levels. For accuracies relevant to preliminary design, order of
   magnitude speedups are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the rigid-spacecraft attitude tracking problem when
   model parameters are unknown but the lower bound of the smallest
   eigenvalue of the inertia matrix is known. Using the dynamic scaling
   method, Immersion and Invariance (I\&I) adaptive controllers are
   proposed without employing a filter for the regressor matrix. A scalar
   scaling factor is implemented either in the control law for the
   filter-free design or in the filter dynamics for the filter-dependent
   controller to overcome the integrability obstacle that arises in I\&I
   adaptive control design. First, a filter-free controller is proposed
   such that the rate feedback gain is proportional to the square of the
   scaling factor in the tracking error dynamics. Then the gain is shown to
   be bounded through the state feedback while achieving stabilization of
   the tracking errors. Since the dynamic scaling factor increases
   monotonically by design, it may end up with a finite but arbitrarily
   large value. However, by introducing three more dynamic equations, the
   non-decreasing scaling factor is removed from the closed-loop system.
   Moreover, the behavior of dynamic gain is controlled by design
   parameters so that its upper bound is limited by a known quantity and
   that the gain returns close to the initial value eventually. The similar
   approach for the dynamic gain design is also applied to the
   filter-dependent controller where the filter for the angular rate is
   utilized to build a parameter estimator. The performances of both
   controllers are demonstrated through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Process noise is often used in estimation filters to account for

   noise acts to inflate the covariance over propagation intervals,

   acceleration errors change significantly over time, the standard process
   noise approach can fail to provide effective representation of the state
   and its uncertainty. Consider covariance analysis techniques provide a
   method to precompute a process noise profile along a reference
   trajectory, using known model parameter uncertainties. The process noise
   profile allows significantly improved state estimation and uncertainty
   representation. The new formulation also eliminates the trial-and error
   tuning currently required of navigation analysts. As a result,
   estimation performance on par with the consider filter is achieved
   without the additional computational cost of the consider filter. A
   linear estimation problem as described in several previous consider
   covariance analysis publications is used to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the precomputed process noise, as well as a nonlinear
   descent scenario at the asteroid Bennu with optical navigation.}},

Abstract = {{Vinti's potential is revisited for analytical propagation of the main
   satellite problem, this time in the context of relative motion. A
   particular version of Vinti's spheroidal method is chosen that is valid
   for arbitrary elliptical orbits, encapsulating J(2), J(3), and
   approximately two thirds of J(4) in an orbit propagation theory without
   resorting to perturbation methods. As a child of Vinti's solution, the
   proposed relative motion model inherits these properties. Furthermore,
   the problem is solved in oblate spheroidal elements, leading to large
   regions of validity for the linearization approximation. After offering
   several enhancements to Vinti's solution, including boosts in accuracy
   and removal of some singularities, the proposed model is derived and
   subsequently reformulated so that Vinti's solution is piecewise
   differentiable. While the model is valid for the critical inclination
   and nonsingular in the element space, singularities remain in the linear
   transformation from ECI coordinates to spheroidal elements when the
   eccentricity nears zero or for nearly circular equatorial orbits. The
   new state transition matrix is evaluated against numerical solutions
   including the.J(2) through J(5) terms for a wide range of chief orbits
   and separation distances. The solution is also compared with
   side-by-side simulations of the original Gim-Alfriend state transition
   matrix, which considers the J(2) perturbation. Code for computing the
   resulting state transition matrix and associated reference frame and
   coordinate transformations is provided online as supplementary material.}},

Abstract = {{Fast and accurate collision probability computations are essential for
   protecting space assets. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is the most
   accurate but computationally intensive method. A Graphics Processing
   Unit (GPU) is used to parallelize the computation and reduce the overall
   runtime. Using MC techniques to compute the collision probability is
   common in literature as the benchmark. An optimized implementation on
   the GPU, however, is a challenging problem and is the main focus of the
   current work. The MC simulation takes samples from the uncertainty
   distributions of the Resident Space Objects (RSOs) at any time during a
   time window of interest and outputs the separations at closest approach.
   Therefore, any uncertainty propagation method may be used and the
   collision probability is automatically computed as a function of RSO
   collision radii. Integration using a fixed time step and a quartic
   interpolation after every Runge Kutta step ensures that no close
   approaches are missed. Two orders of magnitude speedups over a serial
   CPU implementation are shown, and speedups improve moderately with
   higher fidelity dynamics. The tool makes the MC approach tractable on a
   single workstation, and can be used as a final product, or for verifying
   surrogate and analytical collision probability methods.}},

   a significant challenge for the space situational awareness community.
   In a multi-target random finite set framework, such events are ideally

   the Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD) filter have
   recently been developed for the explicit use of spawn models and this
   paper presents the first application of such implementation to the
   tracking of space objects. Configured with a Zero-inflated Poisson spawn
   model, the Gaussian Mixture CPHD filter is applied to the tracking of
   objects generated by fragmentation and similarly modeled events.
   Efficacy of the filter implementation is demonstrated through simulation

   during the process of numerical integration. By applying stabilized
   continuation to a rendezvous scenario in which two spacecraft are
   initialized in the same planar, circular orbit separated by some phase
   angle, a family of minimum time rendezvous solutions is obtained for
   variable levels of thrust, mass flow rate, or initial phase angle
   separation. The approach is first demonstrated on a linear harmonic
   oscillator problem, and then applied to the Keplerian two-body motion
   model. The effectiveness of the stabilized continuation scheme when used

Abstract = {{Millimeter wave (mmWave) networks are sensitive to blockages due to
   buildings in urban areas. This is critical for vehicle-to-infrastructure
   networks which are cellular networks designed to support emerging
   vehicular applications. Motivated by measurement and ray tracing results
   in urban microcells, instead of characterizing the pathloss by Euclidean
   distance, we calculate it by the weighted sum of segment length along
   the propagation path, i.e., Manhattan distance, and a certain corner
   loss at the intersections along the path. We analyze network performance
   by modeling the urban microcell network by a Manhattan Poisson line
   process. Our results show significant differences between Manhattan and
   Euclidean distance-based pathloss models. Assuming the receiver is
   associated with the base station (BS) with the smallest pathloss, we
   derive closed-form expression of the distribution of the associated link
   pathloss. We obtain the coverage probability and reveal the impacts of
   interference from the LOS and NLOS BSs. It is shown that in this
   scenario the interference from a NLOS parallel street is negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Whole-Body Control has been extensively used to achieve humanoid robot
   force and motion tasks simultaneously during recent years. However, most
   existing results have not incorporated low-level actuator dynamics and
   time delays yet. In this study, we propose a novel time-delayed
   Whole-Body Operational Space control (WBOSC) with series elastic
   actuator (SEA) dynamics. This type of controller generalizes our
   previously proposed distributed control structure to multi-input and
   multi-output free floating humanoid robotic systems. Namely, Cartesian
   stiffness control is adopted to design the WBOSC at the centralized
   level while motor damping control is implemented at the embedded level
   to remedy the stability deterioration caused by time delays.
   Additionally, embedded-level torque feedback control is formulated and
   physically interpreted as a shaping of the motor inertia. To ensure
   passivity, we separate the overall system into two subsystems
   interconnected in a feedback configuration. By the Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   functional technique, we propose a delay-dependent passivity criterion
   of the closed-loop system in the form of linear matrix inequalities
   (LMIs), and solve for the allowable maximum time delays via the
   passivity criterion. Numerical simulations of a dynamic locomotion
   process are used to validate the proposed passivity criterion and the
   WBOSC framework.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless networks with directional antennas, like millimeter wave
   (mmWave) networks, have enhanced security. For a large-scale mmWave ad
   hoc network in which eavesdroppers are randomly located, however,
   eavesdroppers can still intercept the confidential messages, since they
   may reside in the signal beam. This paper explores the potential of
   physical layer security in the mmWave ad hoc networks. Specifically, we
   characterize the impact of mmWave channel characteristics and large
   antenna arrays on the secrecy performance. We also characterize the
   impact of artificial noise in this networks. Our results reveal that in
   the low transmit power regime, the use of low mmWave frequency achieves
   better secrecy performance, when increasing transmit power, a transition
   from low mmWave frequency to high mmWave frequency is demanded to
   achieve higher secrecy rates. Eavesdroppers can intercept more
   information by using wide beam pattern. Furthermore, the use of
   artificial noise may be unable to enhance the secrecy rate for the case
   of low node density.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the performance of dynamic zero-forcing
   beamforming with limited feedback and propose adaptive feedback
   partition strategies. Assuming a cellular network model based on
   stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for the
   complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the
   instantaneous signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and the ergodic
   spectral efficiency as functions of the relevant system parameters: the
   cluster size, the number of feedback bits, the intra-cluster geometry,
   and the path-loss exponent. By leveraging these expressions, we propose
   two feedback partition strategies, each of which is applied for known
   intra-cluster geometry and unknown intra-cluster geometry, respectively.
   In the simulations, we verify the accurateness of our analysis and
   demonstrate the proposed strategies by comparing to the equal feedback
   partition. Our results show that by adaptively partitioning the feedback
   bits, the intra-cluster interference is efficiently managed whether the
   intra-cluster geometry is known or not.}},

Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are expected to
   significantly enhance the spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency
   (EE) of future cellular systems. Since the performance gain of massive
   MIMO is fundamentally limited by pilot contamination, pilot reuse design
   is crucial to achieve reasonable cell throughput and user rate. In this
   paper, we leverage stochastic geometry to model pilot reuse in massive
   MIMO systems by introducing a guard region model to match realistic
   pilot allocation strategies. The uplink signal-to-interference-plusnoise
   ratio (SINR) distribution is analytically derived, based on which the
   benefits of pilot reuse on cell-throughput and user-rate are
   investigated. The optimal pilot reuse factor for uplink transmission is
   obtained. We also find through simulations that increasing the pilot
   reuse factor beyond a certain value would not improve user-rate, and
   could even lead to a significant loss of the cell throughput.}},

   During this period, wind speed changes every ten minutes, a capacitor is

Abstract = {{The increased reliability requirements of the current and future
   electric distribution circuits has called for new approaches to
   distribution system planning. This paper presents a reliability-based
   approach to designing electric distribution circuits while using a
   minimum number of distribution lines or secondary branches. The designed
   circuit topology considers both network and customer reliability
   requirements. Network reliability indices quantify the service
   availability of the entire distribution circuit while customer
   reliability indices measure the reliability of the specific customer
   load. A graph theory based computationally efficient algorithm is
   proposed to solve the topology design problem. The proposed algorithm is
   applied to design circuit topologies for the zonal distribution system
   of a shipboard power system and for utility distribution networks. The
   analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is efficient in

Abstract = {{The decrease in PV panel cost has globally increased the residential PV
   installations in the distribution grid. Studies have shown that high PV

   However, the PV hosting capacity limits of the distribution feeder
   depend on various key factors such as voltage class of the feeder, PV
   location, short circuit capacity, and presence of voltage regulation
   devices. This paper focuses on calculating the sensitivity of PV hosting
   capacity to various factors affecting it. The analysis is validated with
   the help of simplified feeder model and also with stochastic framework

Abstract = {{Several major outages have been traced to the failure of remote backup
   protection elements in distance relays. Experience has shown that
   coordination of remote backup zones in stepped-distance protection can
   be vulnerable during stressed conditions. Furthermore, relay settings
   are typically biased for high dependability, resulting in lower security
   especially when several unexpected events coincide. An incorrect
   response by a relay during such a condition can trigger or propagate the
   disturbance. Therefore, a new framework for Model-Based Relaying is
   introduced to supervise and secure the operation of remote backup
   protection elements, such as Zone 3. The framework utilizes the fact
   that while a single relay can observe a 3-phase fault or stressed system
   condition with similar apparent impedances, other system parameters will
   be significantly different. Therefore, the framework proposes to include
   the capability in relays to quickly run circuit model simulations at the
   relay level. The proposed method aims to work in parallel with and
   supervise the conventional distance relay's zone 3 for discrimination
   between 3-phase faults and stressed conditions using the output of local
   circuit model simulations. Several case studies are evaluated to
   demonstrate that dependability is not degraded for true fault conditions
   and security is enhanced for stressed system conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, voltage and reactive power control in distribution
   systems is becoming increasingly complex with the growing penetration
   levels of distributed energy resources (DER), electric vehicle loads,

   Traditional approaches of voltage control rely on slow acting
   electromechanical devices installed on the primary feeder. These
   approaches are not suitable for handling the changing paradigm in the
   distribution systems towards smart grid. Advanced volt-var control
   technologies like smart inverters and other distributed secondary-side
   voltage regulation devices are perceived to be the key enabling
   technologies to meet the requirements of future smart grid such as
   effective voltage control and ability for seamless integration of DER.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses to a power flow solution for AC-DC power systems.
   The AC system consists of transmission lines operated at 60 Hz and at
   low frequencies while the DC system has multi-terminal connections. The
   paper shows power flow in such power systems can be obtained by using
   the existing unified approach for AC-DC systems and reflecting
   impedances of lines operating at low frequencies in AC grids to their
   equivalent impedances at the fundamental power frequency. The equivalent
   transmission lines in terms of power flow of those lines operated at low
   frequencies are first mathematically established. The conventional
   unified approach to solve power flow in AC-DC systems is then discussed
   with a modification to reduce the size of the Jacobian matrix. The
   method is then verified by analyzing the power flow solution of a
   multi-frequency AC and multi-terminal HVDC power system modeled in

Abstract = {{This paper extends the analysis of low frequency AC (LFAC) transmission
   systems and investigates short-circuit fault characteristics and
   distance protection considerations. Due to operation at a low frequency,
   transmission line reactance is reduced and thus the power system
   transfer capability is increased significantly. The transmission line
   impedance reduction, however, creates a drawback in LFAC systems when
   faults occur. The analysis shows that fault currents are expected to be
   much higher than in a 60 Hz system. In addition, LFAC has a longer
   current wavelength and requires the protection system perform quickly to
   clear faults. This paper first examines distance protection in LFAC
   systems and determines that LFAC systems have a larger separation
   between distance protection zone characteristic impedance and load
   impedance in comparison to 60 Hz systems. Next, several typical fault
   types in a power systems are analyzed at different frequencies. A fault
   clearing time case is also calculated and compared between different
   systems. The analysis shows that the critical clearing time (in seconds)
   is less for LFAC systems in comparison to conventional 60 Hz systems.}},

Abstract = {{The low frequency AC (LFAC) transmission, in which a power system is
   operated at a low frequency, i.e., below 50/60 Hz, is superior to the
   conventional 60 Hz system in terms of power transfer capability. In
   addition, due to low operating frequency, the line reactance is reduced
   and thus voltage drops along the line are decreased. The low frequency
   transmission thus offers a higher voltage profile for a power system. In
   other words, an LFAC system can be more voltage stable in comparison to
   the conventional 60-Hz system. This paper intends to focus on the
   voltage stability of an LFAC system. The theoretical foundations of a
   two-bus system are first discussed based on eigenvalue. A modified
   stability index calculation is also introduced for low frequency
   transmission to estimate the system stability accurately. The simulation
   results from a practical system verify that the LFAC transmission has
   great benefits over the 60 Hz system in terms of power transfer
   capability and voltage stability.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the electromagnetic response of ultrathin metasurfaces

   from the canalization regime found at a few terahertz (THz), hyperbolic
   responses present at a few dozens of THz, and anisotropic elliptic TE
   and TM regimes that arise at mid-infrared frequencies. Interestingly,
   this configuration can be tuned by exploiting graphene's field effect.
   We also study the influence of the intrinsic spatial dispersion of
   graphene, demonstrating that it imposes a wavenumber cutoff on the
   hyperbolic dispersion diagram that is inversely proportional to the
   Fermi velocity of electrons in the material. In addition, we show how
   spatial dispersion limit the maximum enhancement of the spontaneous
   emission rate of emitters located nearby. Our findings may lead to the

Abstract = {{Lorentz reciprocity imposes constraints on radiation and scattering. For
   instance, a reciprocal antenna in a reciprocal medium will have
   identical radiation patterns in transmission and reception; therefore,
   in a dense environment a directive antenna will be prone to `hear' its
   own echoes. Likewise, a scattering matrix in reciprocal medium will be
   symmetric, implying particularly that a metasurface that reflects plane
   wave A to plane wave B will necessarily do the reciprocal process, from
   B to A, with identical efficiency. Recent works have shown that weak
   spatiotemporal modulation in high-Q ring resonators can create drastic
   non-reciprocity. Here we show theoretically and experimentally that, by
   proper design, taking advantage of the light-cone filtering property,
   spatiotemporal modulation of low-Q radiating and scattering systems, can
   exhibit also significant non-reciprocity. Possible applications are in
   radio-frequency communication systems, as well as open new directions in
   nanophotonics, energy harvesting, and thermal management, when
   translated to different frequency regimes.}},

Abstract = {{A fast integral-equation method is used to quantify the performance of
   UHF-band antennas near high-fidelity anatomical models of the human
   body. The surface-volume electric-field integral equation pertinent to
   the analysis is solved by employing triangular and voxel antenna-body
   meshes. Traditional basis/testing functions are defined throughout the
   model except at the antenna feed port: A finite-gap port model is used
   and novel basis/testing functions are introduced at the port to improve
   input impedance calculations. The computational costs are reduced by
   using a parallel FFT-accelerated surface-preconditioned iterative
   solver. The resulting method is used to compare the return loss and
   radiation pattern of an asymmetric meandered flare dipole antenna in
   three cases: (i) when it is in free space, (ii) when it is placed next

Abstract = {{Here we present the design and numerical results for an ultrathin
   unidirectional carpet cloak based on the restoration of the phase of the
   reflected wave. This ultrathin carpet cloak conceals a triangular
   surface bump with center height of 4.1 mm and tilt angle of 20 deg. The
   cloaking metasurface consists of an array of closed ring resonators,
   which allow an efficient phase manipulation along the edge of the bump.
   The numerical results at operation frequency f(0) = 80 GHz demonstrate a
   good performance of the designed cloak in both near field and far field.
   The presented cloak has a thin, lightweight, and easy to fabricate
   design for radio and THz frequencies and can find applications in radar
   and antenna systems.}},

Abstract = {{Non-linear non-reciprocity has recently attracted a lot of attention,
   because it allows the realization of non-reciprocal devices without any
   type of external biasing. However, all the non-linear non-reciprocal
   devices that have been proposed so far suffer from a trade-off between
   transmission contrast and maximum transmission. Here, we show that this
   trade-off is the result of time-reversal symmetry and can only be broken
   with appropriately designed multi-stable structures. Based on this
   general fact, we propose a generic design for a perfect non-linear
   isolator, i.e., an isolator which allows perfect transmission in one
   direction and zero transmission in the opposite one. A circuit
   implementation at microwave frequencies is provided and the role of
   parasitic effects, such as loss, on the device performance is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is a very significant phenomenon of quantum
   mechanics. It demonstrates the significance of electromagnetic
   potentials (proportional to fluxes) against the electromagnetic fields
   through the simple paradigm of two electron beams (e-beams). Even though
   they are both traveling through a null field space, their wave functions
   are not equal: the difference is in their phases and it is related to
   the magnetic flux through the area defined by their trajectories.
   Inspired by this fact, we formulate an inverse problem for the magnetic
   permeability of a bio-chemical sample positioned in-between two magnets.
   The data can be taken by measuring the phase difference between the wave
   functions of two split e-beams with parallel trajectories passing
   through the samples. The case of only radial dependence of magnetic
   permeability is fully solved and certain insights are provided for the
   arbitrary radial/azimuthal distributions.}},

Abstract = {{A rank-r matrix X is an element of R-m X n can be written as a product
   UVT, where U is an element of R-m X r and V is an element of R-n X r.
   One could exploit this observation in optimization: e.g., consider the
   minimization of a convex function f (X) over rank-r matrices, where the
   set of rank-r matrices is modeled via the factorization in U and V
   variables. Such heuristic has been widely used before for problem
   instances, where the solution is (approximately) low-rank. Though such
   parameterization reduces the number of variables and is more efficient
   w.r.t. computational and memory requirements (of particular interest is
   the case r << min \{ m, n \}), it comes at a cost: f (UVT) becomes a
   non-convex function w.r.t. U and V.
   In this paper, we study such parameterization in optimizing generic
   smooth convex f, that has Lipschitz continuous gradients, and focus on
   first-order, gradient descent algorithmic solutions. We propose the
   Bi-Factored Gradient Descent (BFGD) algorithm, an efficient first-order
   method that operates on the U, V factors. We show that when f is smooth
   and BFGD is initialized properly, it has local sublinear convergence to
   a globally optimum point. As a test case, we consider the 1-bit matrix
   completion problem: We compare BFGD with state-of-the-art approaches and
   show that it has at least competitive test error performance on real
   dataset experiments, while being faster in execution, as compared to the
   rest of the algorithms. We conclude this work with some remarks and open
   questions for further investigations.}},

   and continuous-state systems under temporal logic specifications. The
   specification is expressed as a deterministic, finite automaton (the
   specification automaton) with transition costs, and the optimal system
   behavior is captured by a cost function that is integrated over time. We
   construct a dynamic programming problem over the product of the
   underlying continuous-time, continuous-state system and the discrete
   specification automaton. To solve this dynamic program, we propose
   controller synthesis algorithms based on approximate dynamic programming
   (ADP) for both linear and nonlinear systems under temporal logic
   constraints. We argue that ADP allows treating the synthesis problem
   directly, without forming expensive discrete abstractions. We show that,
   for linear systems under co-safe temporal logic constraints, the ADP
   solution reduces to a single semidefinite program.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the power system state estimation (PSSE)
   problem, which aims to find the unknown operating point of a power
   network based on a given set of measurements. The measurements of the
   PSSE problem are allowed to take any arbitrary combination of nodal
   active powers, nodal reactive powers, nodal voltage magnitudes and line
   flows. This problem is non-convex and NP-hard in the worst case. We
   develop a set of convex programs with the property that they all solve
   the non-convex PSSE problem in the case of noiseless measurements as
   long as the voltage angles are relatively small. This result is then
   extended to a general PSSE problem with noisy measurements, and an upper
   bound on the estimation error is derived. The objective function of each
   convex program developed in this paper has two terms: one accounting for
   the non-convexity of the power flow equations and another one for
   estimating the noise levels. The proposed technique is demonstrated on
   the 1354-bus European network.}},

Abstract = {{This work deals with an optimal covariance control problem for
   stochastic discrete-time linear systems subject to mean sum constraints
   involving quadratic functions of the state and the control input
   sequences under the assumption of full state information. We show that
   the stochastic optimal control problem is equivalent to a deterministic
   nonlinear program, which, under a judicious choice of the decision
   variable, can be brought to a form in which its performance index is a
   convex, quadratic function subject to both equality and inequality
   quadratic constraints. The key challenge here stems from the fact that
   the equality constraints that result from the terminal constraints on
   the state covariance may not be necessarily convex. We show, however,
   that by employing a simple relaxation technique, the nonlinear program
   is associated with a convex program, which can be addressed by means of
   robust and efficient algorithms. Despite the fact that the solution to
   the relaxed convex program will not necessarily give closed-loop
   trajectories whose endpoints follow exactly the goal Gaussian
   distribution, a representative sample of such trajectories are expected
   to have endpoints that will be more concentrated near the origin than if
   there were drawn from the goal Gaussian distribution. Finally, numerical
   simulations that illustrate some key ideas of the paper are presented.}},

Abstract = {{As the complexity of the specifications that must be met by a system
   increases, hierarchical control protocols that merge control and
   planning decisions at multiple levels of abstraction become necessary.
   For such hierarchical reasoning, a suitable finite-state abstraction for
   dynamical systems evolving over continuous state spaces may be needed.
   The implementation of existing controllers derived using a finite state
   abstraction often require that the current continuous state be known
   exactly, in order to guarantee that the required transitions in the
   finite-state abstraction occur. When the measurements are partial or
   noisy, the true state is unknown, and these controllers cannot be
   implemented. We propose an abstraction that can be used to overcome the
   uncertainty in the state resulting from imperfect measurement, at the
   cost of providing only probabilistic guarantees. The abstraction is
   based on the filter used to maintain an estimate of the true state. We
   show how the abstraction can be used to create a time-varying policy
   which maximizes the minimum probability that a target discrete state is
   reached in finite time from any initial state.}},

Abstract = {{Contact-based decision and planning methods are increasingly being
   sought for task execution in humanoid robots. However, formal methods
   from the verification and synthesis communities have not been yet
   incorporated into the motion planning sequence for complex mobility
   behaviors in humanoid robots. This study takes a step toward formally
   synthesizing high-level reactive task planners for whole-body locomotion
   in unstructured environments. We formulate a two player temporal logic
   game between the contact planner and its possibly adversarial
   environment. The resulting discrete planner satisfies the given task
   specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. The resulting
   commands are executed by a low-level 3D phase-space motion planner
   algorithm. We devise various low-level locomotion modes based on
   centroidal momentum dynamics. Provable correctness of the low-level
   execution of the synthesized discrete task planner is guaranteed through
   the so-called simulation relations. Simulations of dynamic locomotion in
   unstructured environments support the effectiveness of the hierarchical
   planner protocol.}},

   two types of constraints: (i) constraints on the worst-case, maximal
   total cost and (ii) safety threshold constraints that bound the
   worst-case probability of visiting a set of error states. For maximal
   total cost constraints, we propose a state-augmentation method and a
   two-step synthesis algorithm to generate deterministic, memoryless
   optimal policies given the reward to be maximized. For safety threshold
   constraints, we introduce a new cost function and provide an
   approximately optimal solution by a reduction to an uncertain Markov
   decision process under a maximal total cost constraint. The
   safety-threshold constraints require memory and randomization for
   optimality. We discuss the use and the limitations of the proposed
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{Management and analytics for inline manufacturing process data has
   become a critical but increasingly complex task in the semiconductor
   fabrication industry. The importance of new methods for construction of
   informative features has been accentuated by advancements in the data
   collection technology employed in this industry, which has recently
   increased sampling rates for inline data from values below 1 Hz to
   frequencies in excess of 10Hz. In this paper, a new feature construction
   method is proposed that aims to extract as much of the information
   accessible with these increased sampling rates as possible, while
   simultaneously minimizing redundancy and user involvement. The proposed
   method results in a meaningful dynamics inspired feature set, which
   provides insight into the underlying process and equipment dynamics. The
   advantages offered by this feature set are established using data
   collected at several modern 300mm fabs, for chamber and tool matching
   tasks, as well as wafer defect level prediction. (C) 2016, IFAC

Abstract = {{Reliance on third-party resources, including third-party IP cores and
   fabrication foundries, as well as wide usage of commercial-off-the-shelf
   (COTS) components has raised concerns that backdoors and/or hardware
   Trojans may be inserted into fabricated chips. Defending against
   hardware backdoors and/or Trojans has primarily focused on detection at
   various stages in the supply chain. Netlist reverse engineering tools
   have been investigated as an alternative to existing chip-level reverse
   engineering methods which can help recover functional netlists from
   fabricated chips, but fall short of detecting malicious logic or
   recovering high-level functionality. In this work, we develop a netlist
   reverse engineering tool-set which recovers high-level functionality
   from the netlist, thereby aiding malicious logic detection. The tool-set
   performs state register identification, control logic recovery and
   datapath tracking, which facilitates validation of encrypted/obfuscated
   hardware IP cores. Relying on 3-SAT algorithms and topology-based
   computational methods, we demonstrate that the developed tool-set can
   handle netlists of various complexities.}},

   completely conforms to the microscopic morphology of human skin via van

Abstract = {{The resonant tunneling characteristics of the inter layer tunnel
   field-effect transistor (ITFET) within 2D van der Waals' materials can
   be made sharper by the use of multiple (m) intermediate well and tunnel
   barrier layers within a ``mITFET{''} variation. Ballistic quantum
   transport simulations are used to obtain the resonance characteristics
   in an MoS2 based-system, for specificity. Circuit simulations illustrate
   how the sharper resonance can lead to lower operating voltages and,
   thus, power, thereby improving the circuit performance.}},

Abstract = {{Nanophotonics is a prominent field within nanotechnology aimed at
   researching the light-matter interactions occurring at the nanoscale. In
   case of metal nanostructures, collective oscillation of electrons leads
   to nanoscale confinement of optical fields with high thermal energy and
   elevated near-field optical forces. The interactions of these effects
   with molecules known as molecular plasmonics have generated novel
   devices with implications in energy, biology, and healthcare. In this
   chapter, we will review our research on molecular plasmonics in three
   correlated sections: molecular-scale measurements and control, directed
   and self-assembled nanofabrication, and real-life applications. The
   first section presents the measurements and control of molecular-scale
   events using active molecules as a framework. We further summarize two
   unconventional nanofabrication techniques based on directed and
   self-assembly, i.e., moire nanosphere lithography and multi-photon
   plasmonic lithography. The success in these two arenas positions
   molecular plasmonics to be propelled for real-life applications. We
   finally present the potential of plasmonics in achieving its promise of
   creating futuristic technologies.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce Recursive Spoke Darts (RSD): a recursive hyperplane
   sampling algorithm that exploits the full duality between Voronoi and
   Delaunay entities of various dimensions. Our algorithm abandons the
   dependence on the empty sphere principle in the generation of Delaunay
   simplices providing the foundation needed for scalable consistent
   meshing. The algorithm relies on two simple operations: line-hyperplane
   trimming and spherical range search. Consequently, this approach
   improves scalability as multiple processors can operate on different
   seeds at the same time. Moreover, generating consistent meshes across
   processors eliminates the communication needed between them, improving
   scalability even more. We introduce a simple tweak to the algorithm
   which makes it possible not to visit all vertices of a Voronoi cell,
   generating almost-exact Delaunay graphs while avoiding the natural curse
   of dimensionality in high dimensions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

   with multiple regions without post-processing cleanup. Our method starts
   with a strongly balanced octree. In contrast to snapping the grid points
   onto the geometric boundaries, we move points a slight distance away
   from the common boundaries. Then we intersect the moved grid with the
   geometry. This allows us to avoid creating any flat angles, and we are
   able to handle two-sided regions and more complex topologies than prior
   methods. The algorithm is robust and cleanup-free; without the use of
   any pillowing, swapping, or smoothing. Thus, our simple algorithm is
   also more predictable than prior art. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of characterizing an evasion strategy for an
   agent under pursuit by multiple independent agents that are distributed
   in a convex polygon. The proposed evasion strategy is centrally
   dependent on a generalized Voronoi partition of the polygon, whose
   proximity metric is the time of capture of the evader by the nearest
   pursuer. Specifically, the boundaries of the Voronoi cells determine a
   set of preferable paths for the evader that will safely take it to a
   prescribed target set. The motion of the pursuers is accounted for by
   sequential re-partitioning and re-planning. A novel method for the
   computation of the generalized Voronoi partition, which exploits the
   structure of the solution to a two-player differential game, is
   presented. It is shown that the proposed method is significantly faster
   (by at least one order of magnitude) than two known methods in the
   literature; this expedites computation of the proposed evasion strategy.
   Numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   evasion strategy are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper formulates a new dynamic scaling based adaptive control
   design for a class of m(th)-order cascade integrator systems. In order
   to circumvent the integrability obstacle, often inherent to the
   Immersion and Invariance (I\&I) scheme, a scaled off-the-manifold
   coordinate is introduced. This scalar factor is designed such that its
   dynamics are driven by the system states and known reference signals.
   Then, controllers with and without state filters are proposed such that
   the states track predefined reference trajectories and the scaling
   factor is both bounded and nonzero for all time. The proposed method has
   a simple closed-loop structure and requires a lower-order dynamic
   extension than other existing methods. An important feature is that the
   dynamic gain no longer monotonically increases but instead converges,
   often in the vicinity of the initial value. Numerical simulations are
   carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller
   using a model of an aircraft wing's aeroelastic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Residential consumers are significant contributors to peak energy demand
   because of their aggregate daily consumption as a result of typical
   occupancy cycles and responses to fluctuations in ambient temperature.
   In this work, we create an energy management framework that optimizes
   the use of air-conditioning (A/C) systems and energy-intensive household
   appliances in order to minimize the peak load for a community of homes.
   Specifically, we propose a two-tiered approach that first implements a
   centralized model predictive control system which makes thermostat set
   point decisions that reduce the peak of the aggregate demand profile. We
   then execute a scheduling calculation that optimizes the start times and
   cycle duration of the most energy-intensive (and flexible) smart
   appliances to further reduce the peak load. We rely on residential
   energy use data collected from 40 existing houses in Austin, TX, USA and
   local weather information to provide a case study demonstrating the
   efficacy of our framework. On average, the aggregate neighborhood load
   is reduced by 25.8\% (15.7kW) (compared with the case using the original
   thermostat settings and appliance start times), while minimally
   increasing energy use, respecting the thermal comfort and appliance
   completion time preferences of individual homes, and without creating
   secondary demand peaks.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional information-theoretic privacy uses the mutual information
   rate as a metric of privacy for protecting the input data stream sent by
   participating users; a low information rate implies that the entire
   input data stream cannot be correctly inferred from the output with high
   probability. In many applications such as smart metering, however, the
   private event (e.g., whether the user is having dinner within a
   particular time slot) that a user does not wish to reveal may only be
   associated with part of the data stream, which can still be inferred
   correctly by adversaries under a low information rate. To this end, we
   propose a new information-theoretic metric that can provide event-based
   privacy guarantees. As a case study, we consider the problem of
   protecting the privacy in user's home energy usage profile with the aid
   of an internal energy storage device (e.g., a rechargeable battery).
   Through charging and discharging, the energy storage device is capable
   of altering the real-time energy usage profile and masking distinctive
   patterns that may be of interest to adversaries. We evaluate the new
   privacy metric under the best-effort control policy, which tries to keep
   the reported energy usage constant through compensation from the storage
   device. Through simulations, we show that the new privacy metric can be
   computed numerically and gives a nontrivial privacy guarantee.}},

Abstract = {{Recent learning-based extensions to popular adaptive control procedures
   offer improved convergence, but at the cost of increased complexity.
   This complexity makes it difficult to analytically compute level sets
   that bound the system response. These level sets can be combined with
   the a priori known Lyapunov function for such systems to provide barrier
   certificates, verifying the safety of the system to maximum allowable
   error limits. This paper presents a complementary automated procedure
   for computing invariant level sets offline using simulation data. These
   level sets encompass combinations of safe initial conditions and
   parameters that will not cause the adaptive system's response to exceed
   constraints. First, conditions for the complete set of safe initial
   states and parameters, known as the region-of-convergence, are
   established. These conditions, coupled with the known Lyapunov functions
   describing the adaptation, are used to form an optimization procedure to
   construct verifiable level sets for the system response. These levels
   sets thus provide barrier certificates for safety and conservatively
   estimate the complete region-of-convergence. Lastly, the procedure is
   demonstrated on an adaptive control system.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the problem of analyzing and, subsequently, optimizing
   the stabilization capabilities of a class of controllers for input
   constrained nonlinear systems. The proposed techniques apply to
   continuous, state feedback controllers which are defined in a subset of
   the state space where the time derivative of a known, candidate Control
   Lyapunov Function (CLF) can be made negative definite under the input
   constraints. This set is associated with the domain of this class of
   controllers and depends on the CLF. The analysis problem concerns
   approximating the domain and is posed via appropriately formulated set
   containment relationships through the generalized S-procedure with sum
   of squares (SOS) constraints. The optimization problem is concerned with
   the adjustment or enlargement of the domain and constitutes a way of
   controller synthesis. These objectives are pursued via optimizing over
   the coefficients of polynomial CLFs, through a sequence of semidefinite
   programming (SDP) problems with SOS constraints. By partitioning the
   state space based on the structure of the input value set and building
   upon earlier results on SOS methods, the SDP problems are subject to
   only convex constraints, rendering thus the proposed techniques
   computationally viable. The capabilities of the proposed algorithms are
   demonstrated through numerical examples.}},

Pages = {{9561-9574}},
Abstract = {{Classic hydrodynamic arguments establish that when a spherical tracer
   particle is suspended between parallel walls, tracer-wall coupling
   mediated by the solvent will cause the tracer to exhibit
   position-dependent diffusivity. We investigate how the diffusivity
   profiles of confined tracers are impacted by the diameter size-ratio of
   the tracer to solvent: starting from the classic limit of infinite
   size-ratio (i.e., continuum solvent), we consider size-ratios of four or
   less to examine how hydrodynamic predictions are disrupted for systems
   where the tracer and solvent are of similar scale. We use computer
   simulations and techniques based on the Fokker-Planck formalism to
   calculate the diffusivity profiles of hard-sphere tracer particles in
   hard-sphere solvents, focusing on the dynamics perpendicular to the
   walls. Given wall separations of several tracer diameters, we first
   consider confinement between hard walls, where anisotropic structuring
   at the solvent lengthscale generates inhomogeneity in the tracer
   free-energy landscape and undermines hydrodynamic predictions locally.
   We then introduce confining planes that we term transparent walls, which
   restrict tracer and solvent center-accessibilities while completely
   eliminating static anisotropy, and reveal position-dependent signatures
   in tracer diffusivity solely attributable to confinement. With or
   without suppressing static heterogeneity, we find that tracer
   diffusivity increasingly deviates on a local basis from hydrodynamic
   predictions at smaller size-ratios. However, hydrodynamic theory still
   approximately captures spatially-averaged dynamics across the pores even
   for very small tracer-solvent size-ratios over a wide range of solvent
   densities and wall separations.}},

Abstract = {{Lineage analysis has been an important method for understanding the
   mutation patterns and the diversity of genes, such as antibodies. A
   mutation lineage is typically represented as a tree structure,
   describing the possible mutation paths. Generating lineage trees from
   sequence data imposes two unique challenges: (1) Types of constraints
   might be defined on top of sequence data and tree structures, which have
   to be appropriately formulated and maintained by the algorithms. (2)
   Enumerating all possible trees that satisfy constraints is typically
   computationally intractable. In this paper, we present a COnstrained
   Lineage Tree generation framework (COLT) that builds lineage trees from
   sequences, based on local and global constraints specified by domain
   experts and heuristics derived from the mutation processes. Our formal
   analysis and experimental results show that this framework can
   efficiently generate valid lineage trees, while strictly satisfying the
   constraints specified by domain experts.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in automation have the potential to reduce the workload
   required for human planning and execution of missions carried out by
   robotic systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However,
   automation can also result in an increase in system complexity and a
   corresponding decrease in system transparency, which makes identifying
   and reasoning about errors in mission plans more difficult. To help
   explain errors in robotic planning systems, we define a notion of
   structured probabilistic counterexamples, which provide
   human-interpretable diagnostic information about requirements violations
   resulting from complex probabilistic robotic behavior. We propose an
   approach for generating such counterexamples using mixed integer linear
   programming and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach via a case
   study of UAV mission planning demonstrated in the AMASE multi-UAV
   simulator.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of numerically efficient planning for
   legged robot locomotion, aiming towards reactive multi-contact planning
   as a reliability feature. We propose to decompose the problem into two
   parts: an extremely low dimensional kinematic search, which only adjusts
   a geometric path through space: and a dynamic optimization, which we
   focus on in this paper. This dynamic optimization also includes the
   selection of foot steps and hand-holds in the special case of
   instantaneous foot re-location. This case is interesting because I) it
   is a limiting behavior for algorithms with a foot switching cost, 2) it
   may have merit as a heuristic to guide search, and 3) it could act as a
   building block towards algorithms which do consider foot transition
   cost. The algorithm bears similarity both to phase space locomotion
   planning techniques for bipedal walking and the minimum time trajectory
   scaling problem for robot arms. A fundamental aspect of the algorithm's
   efficiency is its use of linear programming with reuse of the active set
   of inequality constraints. Simulation results in a simplified setting
   are used to demonstrate the planning of agile locomotion behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) can lead to significant fatigue damage
   accumulation in deepwater marine risers. In order to assess the effects
   of VIV and to ensure riser integrity, field monitoring campaigns are
   often conducted wherein riser response is recorded by a few data sensors
   distributed along the length of the riser. It is possible to empirically
   estimate the fatigue damage at ``key{''} critical fatigue-sensitive
   locations, where sensors may not be available as part of the spatially
   distributed discrete measurements. In this study, two empirical
   techniques Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Weighted Waveform
   Analysis (WWA)-are sequentially applied to the data; together, they
   offer a novel empirical procedure for fatigue damage estimation in an
   instrumented riser. The procedures are briefly described as follows:
   first, POD is used to extract the most energetic spatial modes of the
   riser response from the measurements. Often, only a few dominant POD
   modes preserve most of the riser motion kinetic energy; other modes are
   less important. Identified POD mode shapes are discrete as they are
   defined only at the available sensor locations. Accordingly, a second
   step in the proposed procedure uses WWA to express each dominant POD
   mode as a series of riser natural modes that are continuous spatial
   functions defined over the entire riser length. Based on the above
   empirically identified modal information, the riser response over the
   entire length is reconstructed using backward procedures i.e., compose
   identified natural modes into the POD modes and, then, assemble all
   these dominant POD modal response components into the derived riser
   response. The POD procedure empirically extracts the energetic dynamic
   response characteristics without any assumptions and effectively cleans
   the data of noisy or less important features, which makes it possible
   for WWA to identify dominant riser natural modes all this is possible
   using the limited number of available measurements from sensor
   locations. Application of the entire procedure is demonstrated using
   experimental data from the Norwegian Deepwater Programme (NDP) model
   riser.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing (AM) is a new and disruptive technology that
   comes with a set of unique challenges. One of them is the lack of
   understanding of the complex relationships between the numerous physical
   phenomena occurring in these processes. Metamodels can be used to
   provide a simplified mathematical framework for capturing the behavior
   of such complex systems. At the same time, they offer a reusable and
   composable paradigm to study, analyze, diagnose, forecast, and design AM
   parts and process plans. Training a metamodel requires a large number of
   experiments and even more so in AM due to the various process parameters
   involved. To address this challenge, this work analyzes and prescribes
   metamodeling techniques to select optimal sample points, construct and
   update metamodels, and test them for specific and isolated physical
   phenomena. A simplified case study of two different laser welding
   process experiments is presented to illustrate the potential use of
   these concepts. We conclude with a discussion on potential future
   directions, such as data and model integration while also accounting for

Abstract = {{Recent research has indicated that embedding small volume fractions of
   negative stiffness (NS) inclusions within a host material can create
   composites with macroscopic mechanical stiffness and loss properties
   that exceed conventional, composites. To design these composites, a
   multi-level, set-based approach that employs Bayesian network
   classifiers was developed to identify sets of satisfactory designs at
   each level of the multilevel design space. In this paper, manufacturing
   uncertainties are incorporated to further refine the design space
   mappings created by the set-based approach. Manufacturing uncertainty
   refers to the random deviations in dimensions and other properties that
   often arise when fabricating a specimen. Joint probability distributions
   are used to model this manufacturing uncertainty. The joint probability
   distributions are formulated as kernel density estimates that can be
   based on manufacturing data. The joint probability distributions are
   incorporated within the set-based approach to identify sets of designs
   that not only yield satisfactory performance but also offer robustness
   to manufacturing uncertainty. The approach is demonstrated in the
   context of hierarchical composite materials, but it can be applied to
   other multi-level design problems to efficiently yield sets of robustly
   manufacturable, high performance designs.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of design concepts is a time consuming and resource
   intensive process. Crowdsourcing evaluations has been examined in
   previous work as a means to reduce the need for expert raters, while
   achieving similar evaluation results. This paper examines the impact of
   empathically priming novice raters on their evaluation of alternative
   design concepts. The rating system is based on a pairwise comparison
   method that requires minimal training of novice raters. In a pilot study
   the pairwise method for crowdsourcing evaluations is compared with
   crowdsourced evaluations using non-pairwise rating scales and with the
   evaluations of expert raters. The primary study incorporates written and
   empathic priming strategies to determine their impact on novice raters'
   evaluation of concepts. Raters are asked to consider several criteria,
   including novelty, feasibility, clarity (of the concept), usefulness,
   ease of use, and overall worthiness of further development. Results
   offer insight into the criteria that are most relevant to novice raters
   and whether empathic priming has a significant effect on those

Abstract = {{Solidification control is required for the suppression of segregation
   defects in vacuum arc remelting of superalloys. In recent years, process
   controllers for the VAR process have been proposed based on linear
   models, which are known to be inaccurate in highly-dynamic conditions,
   e.g. start-up, hot-top and melt rate perturbations. A novel controller
   is proposed using auxiliary particle filter-model predictive control
   based on a nonlinear stochastic model. The auxiliary particle filter
   approximates the probability of the state, which is fed to a model
   predictive controller that returns an optimal control signal. For
   simplicity, the estimation and control problems are solved using
   Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The validity of this approach is
   verified for a 430 mm (17 in) diameter Alloy 718 electrode melted into a
   510 mm (20 in) diameter ingot. Simulation shows a more accurate and
   smoother performance than the one obtained with an earlier version of
   the controller.}},

   depth was marked by a power cutback of several minutes. The ingot was

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of performing diagnosis using
   production test results in a test compression environment. For linear
   response compactors, such as multiple-input shift register (MISRs),
   diagnosis must be performed from signatures. The key idea in this work
   is to use symbolic canceling in MISR signatures to extract information
   from both the MISR signature bits with errors as well as those that are
   error-free to provide more precise diagnostic information. A
   fundamentally new technique for precisely identifying error locations
   for propagation cones reaching fewer scan cells than the size of the
   MISR is described. The proposed approach does not require any additional
   hardware or extra data to be collected. It uses off-line software-based
   processing (symbolic simulation combined with Gaussian elimination) to
   extract information from signatures to deduce error locations even when
   there are a large number of errors. Unlike existing techniques for
   diagnosis from signatures, the proposed diagnosis approach can be used
   even when there are unknown (X) values in the output response.
   Experimental results demonstrate the reductions in suspect set size that
   can be obtained with the proposed techniques.}},

   decides its own motion, rather than entrusting control of all vehicles

   motion plans are developed by reinforcement learning on simulations of
   intersection traffic. The developed system is shown to route vehicles to
   their destination in a safe and timely manner. In the near future, this
   system can be deployed to as a collision warning/collision avoidance aid
   to human drivers by selectively acting on the discrepancy between a

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a flat address space organization called
   SILC-FM that allows subblocks from two pages to coexist in an
   interleaved fashion in die-stacked DRAM. Data movement at subblocked
   granularity consumes less bandwidth compared to migrating the entire
   large block and prevents fetching useless subblocks that may never get
   accessed. SILC-FM can get more spatial locality hits than CAMEO and PoM
   due to page-level operation and interleaving blocks respectively. The
   interleaved subblock placement improves performance by 55\% on average
   over a static placement scheme without data migration. We also
   selectively lock hot blocks to prevent them from being involved in the
   hardware swapping operations. Additional features such as locking,
   associativity and bandwidth balancing improve performance by 11\%, 8\%,
   and 8\% respectively, resulting in a total of 82\% performance

Abstract = {{Kernel summation is a widely used computational kernel that involves
   matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) and matrix-vector multiplication
   (GEMV) computational primitives. The parallelism exhibited in kernel
   summation suggests performance improvement when running on GPGPU. State
   of the art GPU solutions apply cuBLAS library but cannot exploit much of
   the data locality because intermediate results are written back to main
   memory in between key operations. This paper presents an optimized
   implementation that yields better performance and high energy
   efficiency. Our contributions are fusing all steps of kernel summation
   into the matrix multiplication code structure and optimizing memory
   access ordering to make good use of shared memory and cache hierarchy.
   We decompose the kernel summation problem into individual tasks with few
   dependencies and strike a balance between finer grained parallelism and
   reduced data replication. Based on hardware characteristics, we map
   threads to matrix elements in an interleaved way, and reposition matrix
   elements to avoid shared memory load and store bank conflicts. We also
   apply double buffering to hide memory access latency.
   We analyze both performance and energy benefits of our fused kernel
   summation compared with the implementation based on cuBLAS. We show that
   in low dimensions our approach achieves a speedup of up to 1.8X, and
   saves up to 33\% of total energy in all tested problem sizes.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was conducted to measure the deformation
   of flapping wings with distributed piezoelectric modal sensors. The
   sensors are bonded to the surface of a wing and shaped to extract a
   specific modal co-ordinate. The experimental setup consisted of a carbon
   fiber beam with shaped sensors designed to extract the 1(st) and 2(nd)
   modal co-ordinates. The beam was mounted to two different excitation
   devices (shaker or servomotor) that allowed the beam to be excited at a
   desired frequency and motion. The resulting electrical signals from the
   strained modal sensors are calibrated to modal co-ordinate measurements.
   In order to validate modal sensor measurements, the Digital Image
   Correlation (DIC) technique is used to obtain full field deformation
   measurements of the beam. The measured deformation from DIC is then used
   in conjunction with operational modal analysis to extract modal
   co-ordinates. Comparison of the modal co-ordinates obtained via modal
   sensors against DIC measurements show, good agreement. Furthermore, a
   sensitivity analysis was performed to gauge the robustness of modal
   sensors against construction errors. The results obtained show that
   modal sensors are a simple and accurate method of obtaining the
   deformation of a flapping wing.}},

Abstract = {{Boiling heat transfer impacts the performance of various industrial
   processes like quenching, desalination and, steam generation. At high
   temperatures, boiling heat transfer is limited by the formation of a
   vapor layer at the solid-liquid interface (Leidenfrost effect), where
   the low thermal conductivity of the vapor layer inhibits heat transfer.
   Interfacial electrowetting (EW) fields can disrupt this or layer to
   promote liquid-surface wetting. This concept works for a variety of
   quenching media including water and organic solvents. We experimentally
   analyze EW-induced disruption of the vapor layer, and measure the
   resulting enhanced cooling during quenching. Imaging is employed to
   visualize the fluid-surface interactions and understand boiling patterns
   in the presence of an electrical voltage. It is seen that EW
   fundamentally changes the boiling pattern, wherein, a stable vapor layer
   is replaced by intermittent wetting of the surface. This switch in the
   heat transfer mode substantially reduces the cool down time. An order of
   magnitude increase in the cooling rate is observed. An analytical model
   is developed to extract instantaneous voltage dependent heat transfer
   rates from the cooling curve. The results show that electric fields can
   alter and tune the traditional cooling curve. Overall, this study
   presents a new concept to control the mechanical properties and
   metallurgy, by electrical control of the quench rate.}},

   fs) in waveguides composed of silicon nanoparticles, in both linear and
   nonlinear regimes. We show that in the linear regime the pulses
   significantly broaden on a length of tens of micrometers, due to the
   strong waveguide dispersion of the chain. In the nonlinear regime, the
   pulse broadening can be compensated by nonlinear effects in the chains
   of nonspherical nanoparticles. It is possible due to the interplay of
   the electric and magnetic resonances in the nanodisks, which changes the
   sign of the group velocity dispersion in a range of frequencies, making
   possible the formation of solitary waves.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2561}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicles offer new traffic behaviors that could revolutionize
   transportation. Examples include reservation-based intersection control
   and reduced reaction times that result in greater road capacity. Most
   studies have used microsimulation models of those new technologies to
   study their impacts more realistically. However, microsimulation is not
   tractable for larger networks. Recent developments in simulating
   reservation-based controls and multiclass cell transmission models for
   autonomous vehicles in dynamic traffic assignment have allowed studies
   of larger networks. This paper presents analyses of several highly
   congested arterial and freeway networks to quantify how reservations and
   reduced reaction times affect travel times and congestion. Reservations
   were observed to improve over signals in most situations. However,
   signals outperformed reservations in a congested network with several
   close local road and arterial intersections because the capacity
   allocations of signals were more optimized for the network. Reservations
   also were less efficient than were traditional merges and diverges for
   on- and off-ramps. However, the increased capacity from reduced
   following headways resulted in significant improvements for both freeway
   and arterial networks. Finally, the authors studied a downtown network,
   including freeway, arterial, and local roads, and found that the
   combination of reservations and reduced following headways resulted in a
   78\% reduction in travel time.}},

Pages = {{41-51}},
Abstract = {{With many of today's metropolitan areas experiencing changes in
   population and land development faster than the traditional
   transportation planning efforts can be undertaken, new methods for
   transportation planning are constantly being explored. This paper
   presents a novel approach to the transportation planning problem through
   the use of location-based social networking data and the many-to-many
   modeling structure of peer-to-peer modeling. With smartphone and tablet
   use increasing in the United States, many popular social networking
   sites have begun to include geospatial location in their platforms, and
   location based social networking data sources have become attractive
   data sets for the transportation community because of their ability to
   be representative of populations and to provide detailed spatial
   temporal data. The novel origin destination estimation method through
   peer-to-peer modeling is presented, and a case study example of Austin,
   Texas, provides initial findings through a comparison against a doubly
   constrained gravity model and an existing origin destination matrix for
   the study area. This first look at peer-to-peer modeling for origin
   destination estimation revealed the method's strengths with respect to
   intrazonal trip estimations and production and attraction estimations
   and was found to be more computationally efficient than the doubly
   constrained gravity model.}},

   Experience from the Netherlands}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2543}},
Pages = {{166-175}},
Abstract = {{Incentive-based travel demand management strategies are gaining
   increasing attention because they are generally considered more
   acceptable by the traveling public and policy makers. This study
   presented a detailed analysis and modeling effort aimed at understanding
   how incentives affected traveler choices by using data collected from a
   reward-based experiment conducted in 2006 in the Netherlands. The
   incentive-based scheme analyzed in this study included monetary rewards
   or credit toward obtaining a smartphone with a view to motivating
   commuters to change their choice of departure time out of the peak
   period or to shift their mode of travel. The mixed panel multinomial
   logit modeling approach adopted in this study was able to isolate the
   impacts of incentives on behavioral choices while accounting for
   variations in such impacts across socioeconomic groups that might have
   been due to unobserved individual preferences and constraints. The model
   also shed light on the effects of behavioral inertia, in which
   individuals were prone to continue their past behavior even when it was
   no longer optimal. Finally, the study offered insights on the extent to
   which behavioral changes persisted after termination of the incentive
   period. In general, it was found that incentives were effective in
   changing behavior and overcame inertial effects; however, individuals
   largely reverted to their original behavior when the rewards were
   eliminated. This finding suggests that incentives need to be provided
   for a sustained period to bring about lasting change.}},

Abstract = {{The application of memristors in logic operations has recently gained
   importance and is being investigated. The work presented in this paper
   describes a new low power technique of using memristors to perform
   arithmetic operations. It focuses on reducing the hardware costs and
   associated design complexity. The idea of ``logic implication{''} is
   combined with an analog technique of using current mirrors to perform
   logic operations. By using current mirrors, the problem of limited
   fan-out of logic implication can be overcome, enabling more parallel
   operations to run together. The delay for even an XOR operation can be
   reduced to 1 cycle, compared to the 5 cycles taken by logic implication.
   The design of a full adder is also described. It is shown that the delay
   to sum and carry is 2 cycles each. Metrics like area and latency are
   compared to previous works.}},

Abstract = {{We develop two families of mixed finite elements on quadrilateral meshes
   for approximating (u,p) solving a second order elliptic equation in
   mixed form. Standard Raviart-Thomas (RT) and Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM)
   elements are defined on rectangles and extended to quadrilaterals using
   the Piola transform, which are well-known to lose optimal approximation
   of del.u. Arnold-Boffi-Falk spaces rectify the problem by increasing the
   dimension of RT, so that approximation is maintained after Piola
   mapping. Our two families of finite elements are uniformly inf-sup
   stable, achieve optimal rates of convergence, and have minimal
   dimension. The elements for u are constructed from vector polynomials
   defined directly on the quadrilaterals, rather than being transformed
   from a reference rectangle by the Piola mapping, and then supplemented
   by two (one for the lowest order) basis functions that are Piola mapped.
   One family has full H(div)-approximation (u, p, and del.u are
   approximated to the same order like RT) and the other has reduced
   H(div)-approximation (p and del.u are approximated to one less power
   like BDM). The two families are identical except for inclusion of a
   minimal set of vector and scalar polynomials needed for higher order
   approximation of del.u and p, and thereby we clarify and unify the
   treatment of finite element approximation between these two classes. The
   key result is a Helmholtz-like decomposition of vector polynomials,
   which explains precisely how a divergence is approximated locally. We
   develop an implementable local basis and present numerical results
   confirming the theory.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new strategy for coupling the parallel in time (parareal)
   iterative methodology with multiscale integrators. Following the
   parareal framework, the algorithm computes a low-cost approximation of
   all slow variables in the system using an appropriate multiscale
   integrator, which is refined using parallel fine scale integrations.
   Convergence is obtained using an alignment algorithm for fast phase-like
   variables. The method may be used either to enhance the accuracy and
   range of applicability of the multiscale method in approximating only
   the slow variables, or to resolve all the state variables. The numerical
   scheme does not require that the system is split into slow and fast
   coordinates. Moreover, the dynamics may involve hidden slow variables,
   for example, due to resonances. We propose an alignment algorithm for
   almost-periodic solutions, in which case convergence of the parareal
   iterations is proved. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in
   numerical examples.}},

Pages = {{A3696-A3719}},
Abstract = {{We present a systematic and constructive methodology to devise various
   hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for linearized shallow
   water equations. It is shown that using the Rankine-Hugoniot condition
   to solve the Riemann problem is a natural approach to deriving HDG
   methods. At the heart of our development is an upwind HDG framework
   obtained by hybridizing the upwind flux in the standard discontinuous
   Galerkin (DG) approach. Essentially, the HDG framework is a redesign of
   the standard DG approach to reducing the number of coupled unknowns. An
   upwind and three other HDG methods are constructed and analyzed for
   linearized shallow water systems. Rigorous stability and convergence
   analysis for both semidiscrete and fully discrete systems are provided.
   We extend the upwind HDG method to a family of penalty HDG schemes and
   rigorously analyze their well-posedness, stability, and convergence
   rates. Numerical results for the linear standing wave and the Kelvin
   wave for oceanic shallow water systems are presented to verify our
   theoretical findings.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{C748-C781}},
Abstract = {{We expose a systematic approach for developing distributed-memory
   parallel matrix-matrix multiplication algorithms. The journey starts
   with a description of how matrices are distributed to meshes of nodes
   (e.g., MPI processes), relates these distributions to scalable parallel
   implementation of matrix-vector multiplication and rank-1 update,
   continues on to reveal a family of matrix-matrix multiplication
   algorithms that view the nodes as a two-dimensional (2D) mesh, and
   finishes with extending these 2D algorithms to so-called
   three-dimensional (3D) algorithms that view the nodes as a 3D mesh. A
   cost analysis shows that the 3D algorithms can attain the (order of
   magnitude) lower bound for the cost of communication. The paper
   introduces a taxonomy for the resulting family of algorithms and
   explains how all algorithms have merit depending on parameters such as
   the sizes of the matrices and architecture parameters. The techniques
   described in this paper are at the heart of the Elemental
   distributed-memory linear algebra library. Performance results from
   implementation within and with this library are given on a
   representative distributed-memory architecture, the IBM Blue Gene/P
   supercomputer.}},

Abstract = {{In this work the design of an ultrathin carpet cloak based on a
   metasurface with ring resonators is demonstrated. The scattering from a
   triangular bump of a Gaussian beam is suppressed by manipulating the
   reflection phase along the edge of the bump. This is achieved by an
   array of closed ring resonators with varying radii. The object to hide
   can be placed under the bump on a flat ground plane. The performance of

Abstract = {{In this contribution, we present some important advancements in Doppler
   cloak technology, which is based on the frequency mixing property of
   linear momentum-biased metamaterial, whose artificial permittivity
   function is modulated in space and time. The importance of such a
   technology is given by the possibility to manipulate the Doppler effect
   and restore the invisibility of cloaked object in relativistic motion.
   Here, we review the main characteristics of a conventional Doppler
   cloak, consisting of a system composed of a planar reflector covered by
   a spatio-temporally modulated slab. We demonstrate that such a scheme
   presents some drawbacks in terms of efficiency and, therefore, an
   enhanced version based on a momentum-biased parallel-plate medium is
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Non-static media have recently raised significant attention in the
   research community for their ability to break reciprocity without the
   use of magnetic fields. Different approaches to realize such media have
   been proposed in electromagnetics and acoustics, including mechanical
   motion and spatiotemporal modulation. Here, we connect these two
   approaches and show that they can both be derived from the same
   fundamental relativistic principles. We start our analysis with linear
   mechanical motion, and show that in the case of near-zero refractive
   index it is possible to achieve positive and negative refractive index
   for opposite propagation directions. Next, we show that a similar effect
   can be achieved with a moving Bragg grating, which can be realized
   through spatiotemporal modulation, thus avoiding any practically
   challenging physical motion. We also show that similar remarks apply to
   the case of spinning ring resonators, which can form the basis of
   magnet-less acoustical and electromagnetic circulators. Finally, we
   discuss the consequences of the equivalence between physical motion and
   spatiotemporal modulation to applications beyond non-reciprocity, such
   as spontaneous light generation from dielectric or plasmonic slabs in
   relative motion with each other.}},

Abstract = {{Gradient metasurfaces have recently received significant attention for
   the unique opportunities they offer for advanced wave manipulation. Such
   metasurfaces are usually discrete implementations of surface impedance
   profiles, which are analytically derived to yield the desired operation.
   Several recent numerical and experimental studies have shown that
   gradient metasurfaces can work very well over large bandwidths,
   extending to frequencies where the definition of surface impedance is
   not straightforward. Here, we develop an alternative description of such
   metasurfaces based on coupled-mode theory and provide an explanation for
   this intriguing effect. Quite surprisingly, our theory shows that
   broadband anomalous reflection and transmission, does not necessarily
   require the use of spatial gradients, but they can be achieved through
   suitably designed periodic arrays of resonant particles. In addition to
   their theoretical importance, our results can be important for the
   design of efficient metasurfaces with specified frequency response.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a measurement-based birth model with the
   Cardinalized Probabilistic Hypothesis Density (CPHD) filter using the
   probabilistic admissible region (PAR) for tracking space objects.
   Insufficient information content in a short-duration time series of
   observations makes track instantiation for space objects difficult.
   Models based on the admissible region define the initial probability
   density function for a target's kinematic state using a single tracklet.
   The measurement-based, partially-uniform birth model in the CPHD assumes
   independence between the measurement density and the probabilistic
   representation of the single-target state in unobserved directions.
   Previous applications of the admissible region for modeling newtarget
   birth define the probability density in the unobserved directions as a
   function of the realized observation, thereby violating the birth
   model's assumption. Combining a uniform distribution over the sensor
   field of view with a PAR-based model ensures independence with realized
   measurements and enables its use in a partially-uniform birth model.
   This paper presents the proposed birth model and demonstrates filter
   performance in a simulation for tracking space objects via optical
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a generic weighted check-sum code based

   the input array at the 2D linear transformation level, and algorithms
   are designed to operate on encoded data and produce encoded output data.
   The proposed error detection technique is a system-level method
   therefore can be used in existing hardware or software 2-D linear
   transformation architectures with low overhead. More importantly, the
   proposed weighted checksum code based error detection can enable quality
   metric aware error detection which only flags an error when the quality
   of the result is lower than expectation. The error tolerance detection

Abstract = {{Software testing is one of the most widely used approaches for improving
   software reliability. The effectiveness of testing depends to a large
   extent on the quality of test suites. Researchers have developed various
   techniques to evaluate the quality of test suites. Of these techniques,
   mutation testing is generally considered to be the most advanced but
   also expensive. A key result of applying mutation testing to a given
   test suite is the mutation score representing the percentage of mutants
   killed by the test suite. Ideally the mutation score is computed
   ignoring the mutants that are semantically equivalent to the original
   code under test or to one another.
   In this paper, we investigate a new perspective on mutation testing:
   evaluating how standard compiler optimizations affect the cost and
   results of mutation testing performed at the compiler intermediate
   representation. Our study targets LLVM, a popular compiler
   infrastructure that supports multiple source and target languages. Our
   evaluation on 18 Coreutils programs discovers several interesting
   relations between the numbers of mutants (including the numbers on
   equivalent and duplicated mutants) and mutation scores on unoptimized
   and optimized programs.}},

Abstract = {{We present a parallel algorithm for computing the approximate
   factorization of an N-by-N kernel matrix. Once this factorization has
   been constructed (with N log(2) N work), we can solve linear systems
   with this matrix with N logN work. Kernel matrices represent pairwise
   interactions of points in metric spaces. They appear in machine
   learning, approximation theory, and computational physics. Kernel
   matrices are typically dense (matrix multiplication scales quadratically
   with N) and ill-conditioned (solves can require 100s of Krylov
   iterations). Thus, fast algorithms for matrix multiplication and
   factorization are critical for scalability.
   Recently we introduced ASKIT, a new method, which resembles N-body
   methods, for approximating a kernel matrix. Here we introduce INV-ASKIT,
   a factorization scheme based on ASKIT. We describe the new method,
   derive complexity estimates, and conduct an empirical study of its
   accuracy and scalability. We report results on real-world datasets
   including ``COVTYPE{''} (0.5M points in 54 dimensions), ``SUSY{''} (4.5M
   points in 8 dimensions) and ``MNIST{''} (2M points in 784 dimensions)
   using shared and distributed memory parallelism. In our largest run we
   approximately factorize a dense matrix of size 32M x 32M (generated from
   points in 64 dimensions) on 4,096 Sandy-Bridge cores. To our knowledge
   these results improve the state of the art by several orders of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design and realistic implementation of an
   ultrathin active radio-frequency cloak, capable of significantly
   suppressing the scattering from electrically large objects beyond the
   limitations of passive cloaking techniques. The object is coated with a
   metasurface loaded by a discrete number of lumped circuit elements,
   which follow a rigorously derived distribution of balanced gain and
   loss, able to minimize the scattering cross-section of the system. The
   loss portion is tailored using passive components to absorb the incident
   wave and avoid back reflections, while the gain portion utilizes active
   circuitry to automatically generate a synchronized version of the
   impinging signal on the other side of the cloak, in order to suppress
   shadow and forward scattering. We derive the required metasurface
   parameters, including the frequency dispersion of its elements, in order
   to achieve a given reduction of the total radar cross section of PEC
   circular cylinders, with special attention to ensure stability of the
   active system. A design example is provided for a cylinder with a
   diameter of one wavelength at 1 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Suppressing the unwanted scattering from an antenna while maintaining
   its optimal absorption capabilities is desirable in many practical
   applications. However, traditional techniques to suppress the scattering
   of a receiving antenna typically come at the price of significantly
   lowering the absorbed power, and are thus unfavorable for realistic
   applications. On the contrary, we prove that the proper interference of
   multiple scattering modes can decouple the constraints on scattering and
   absorption of a system, opening a new venue to implement an efficient
   sensor with minimized scattering signature. Here, we theoretically and
   experimentally present the design of microwave antennas based on
   overlapped electric and magnetic dipolar modes, observing over 6-dB
   scattering suppression without sacrificing absorption. The presented
   technique is of special interest for non-invasive sensing and radar
   technology.}},

   is accelerated by using the multilevel non-uniform grid algorithm
   reducing the computational complexity to O(NlogN). The procedure's

Abstract = {{Surface properties of engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are
   strongly affected by environmental transformation. The fate and
   transport of these transformed AgNPs is largely unknown and cannot be
   fully explained by the traditional Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek

   changes in the composition and surface properties of
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped AgNPs after environmental
   transformation and their subsequent effects on the flocculation and
   filtration of these transformed AgNPs during water treatment processes.
   To study the aggregation and deposition behavior of the transformed
   particles, PVP-AgNPs exposed to humic acid (HA) and/or sulfidation were
   characterized, followed by separate flocculation, granular media
   filtration, and quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM) experiments. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that HA exposure modified the
   original PVP capping via adsorption and/or ligand exchange and that
   sulfidation stripped the PVP from the particle surface as a result of
   the formation of silver sulfide. Sulfidation thereby reduced the
   stability of PVP-AgNPs in self-aggregation but enhanced the mobility of
   AgNPs in granular media filtration and quartz collector deposition.
   Without unbound macromolecules in the background solution, polymers on
   the particle surface largely prevent self-aggregation but allow
   favorable clean bed deposition. This difference between the effects on
   self-aggregation and granular media filtration is in contrast to
   traditional DLVO theory. QCM yielded two types of results, the initial
   rate of deposition and the ultimate deposition, and both gave insights
   into expected filtration behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study joint design of linear hybrid precoding and
   equalization for full-duplex (FD) massive multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) systems such that the sum mean squared error is minimized across
   all mobile stations. To better resolve practical issues such as hardware
   complexity, power consumption, and overhead of channel estimation,
   hybrid processing, which consists of digital processing in the baseband
   and radio frequency (RF) analog processing, is employed at the base
   station for simultaneous transmission and reception. In particular,
   baseband processing is adjusted according to instantaneous channel
   variation while RF processing is only updated based on such long-term
   channel statistics as transmit and receive correlation. In the presence
   of self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference, joint power
   optimization is carried out in order to achieve balanced performance for
   both the uplink and the downlink. As demonstrated by numerical results,
   FD is able to outperform half-duplex under realistic SI. Furthermore,
   the employment of the proposed hybrid processing structure is justified
   by its near optimal performance when equipped with even only a small
   number of RF chains.}},

Abstract = {{We study the optimal geographic content placement problem for
   device-to-device (D2D) networks in which the content popularity follows
   the Zipf law. We consider a D2D caching model where the locations of the
   D2D users (caches) are modeled by a Poisson point process (PPP) and have
   limited communication range and finite storage. Unlike most related work
   which assumes independent placement of content, and does not capture the
   locations of the users, we model the spatial properties of the network
   including spatial correlation in terms of the cached content. We propose
   two novel spatial correlation models, the exchangeable content model and
   a Matern (MHC) content placement model, and analyze and optimize the hit
   probability, which is the probability of a given D2D node finding a
   desired file at another node within its communication range. We contrast
   these results to the independent placement model, and show that
   exchangeable placement performs worse. On the other hand, MHC placement
   yields a higher cache hit probability than independent placement for
   small cache sizes.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a multi-antenna downlink cellular network using either
   single-user maximal ratio transmission (MRT) or multi-user zero-forcing
   (ZF) transmission. The locations of the base stations are modeled by a
   Poisson point process to allow the inter-cell interference to be
   tractably analyzed. A tight lower bound on the optimum number of
   feedback bits maximizing the net spectral efficiency is derived, whereby
   the cost of feedback sent via uplink is subtracted from the
   corresponding gain in downlink spectral efficiency. When using MRT, the
   optimum number of feedback bits is shown to scale linearly with the
   number of antennas, and logarithmically with the channel coherence time.
   With ZF, the optimum amount of feedback scales the same as with MRT, but
   additionally also increases linearly with the pathloss exponent.}},

Abstract = {{Coordinating production scheduling decisions with the process control
   system requires considering the evolution of the process over multiple
   time scales and at multiple levels of detail. From a mathematical
   perspective, this requires dealing with process models that are
   large-scale, ill-conditioned and involve both continuous and discrete
   variables (the former related to physical states, while the latter
   reflect production management decisions). In this paper, we introduce a
   novel methodology for time scale-bridging between production scheduling
   and process control. We use process operating data to obtain low-order
   models of the closed-loop behavior of the process, which are then
   incorporated in the production scheduling framework. The theoretical
   developments are accompanied by an illustrative case study on a methyl
   methacrylate process, showing excellent economic results and
   significantly improved computational performance.}},

Abstract = {{Near-field strong ground is the main factor that causes serious damage
   when large earthquake occurred. It is very important to put the
   predicted ground motion into disaster prevention and aseismatic design.
   We use empirical green function method to simulate the Kumamoto
   M(JMA)7.3 earthquake, in Kyushu, Japan. This method chose an appropriate
   aftershock as green function. Stacking the green function composes the
   main earthquake time histories according to a sort of rupture pattern.
   We simulated and compared 47 stations' observed data and synthetic data,
   such as time-histories, Fourier spectrum, PGA distribution
   characteristic. Conclusions show that simulated results is good enough
   to reflect ground motion's distribution characteristic in which
   epicenter distance is less than 50km. The synthetic peak value of time
   history and duration is in a good coincidence with observed peak value.
   Fourier spectrum fit better in high frequency which bandwidth is from
   1Hz to 15Hz. The distribution characteristic of PGA also has a high
   similarity. PGA in near-field attenuates radically all around with
   ellipse shape. There is also an abnormal phenomenon that the simulated
   result of station FKO015 is larger than observed data.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient methodology for soft error analysis of sequential circuits
   based on Monte Carlo sampling is proposed. It uses nested sampling for
   faster statistical convergence: it samples only from the workload space
   and statically evaluates the conditional probability over the subspace
   of particle strike and circuit parameters. A novel check on the
   stationarity of machine state sequence to reduce the number of samples
   to convergence is introduced. The flow combines logic simulation for
   latch-level error propagation and stationarity diagnostic and an
   improved combinational error simulator with a new masking model based on
   signal controllability.
   Experiments show that nested sampling reduces the number of samples by
   up to 1500X and runtime by up to 25X compared to direct sampling.
   Stationarity checking allows reducing sampling number by 25\%, on
   average. The new latching window model permits accuracy of within 1\%
   from SPICE, compared to a 12\% error with a prior model.}},

Abstract = {{The execution-simulation gap (ESG) is a fundamental property of public
   physical unclonable function (PPUF), which exploits the time gap between
   direct IC execution and computer simulation. ESG needs to consider both
   advanced computing scheme, including parallel and approximate computing
   scheme, and IC physical realization. In this paper, we propose a novel
   PPUF design, whose execution is equivalent to solving the
   hard-to-parallel and hard-toapproximate max-flow problem in a complete
   graph on chip. Thus, max-flow problem can be used as the simulation
   model to bound the ESG rigorously. To enable an efficient physical
   realization, we propose a crossbar structure and adopt source
   degeneration technique to map the graph topology on chip. The difference
   on asymptotic scaling between execution delay and simulation time is
   examined in the experimental results. The measurability of output
   difference is also verified to prove the physical practicality.}},

Abstract = {{When a robot is deployed to a new setting, it must reason about how to
   accomplish the goals of domain-appropriate tasks within the environment
   it is situated. We investigate the problem of enabling robots to
   interactively learn how to perform known tasks in new environments. Each
   task is composed of a sequence of parameterized actions, which we assume
   are given to the robot in the form of a task recipe. In order to learn
   how to ground the task in a new environment, our learner builds
   classifiers to model each of the parameters (i.e. all unique objects and
   semantic locations) associated with the task. In evaluation for two
   tasks across three different environments, our results show that these
   groundings are both (1) capable of being learned efficiently from
   demonstrations, and (2) necessary to learn for each new environment.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an effective technique to enhance night-time hazy scenes.
   Our technique builds on multi-scale fusion approach that use several
   inputs derived from the original image. Inspired by the dark-channel
   {[}1] we estimate night-time haze computing the airlight component on
   image patch and not on the entire image. We do this since under
   night-time conditions, the lighting generally arises from multiple
   artificial sources, and is thus intrinsically non-uniform. Selecting the
   size of the patches is non-trivial, since small patches are desirable to
   achieve fine spatial adaptation to the atmospheric light, this might
   also induce poor light estimates and reduced chance of capturing hazy
   pixels. For this reason, we deploy multiple patch sizes, each generating
   one input to a multiscale fusion process. Moreover, to reduce the
   glowing effect and emphasize the finest details, we derive a third
   input. For each input, a set of weight maps are derived so as to assign
   higher weights to regions of high contrast, high saliency and small
   saturation. Finally the derived inputs and the normalized weight maps
   are blended in a multi-scale fashion using a Laplacian pyramid
   decomposition. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our approach compared with recent techniques both in terms of
   computational efficiency and quality of the outputs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the possibility of soft-islanding

   grid in the Netherlands. Energy balancing is possible through applying
   multi-mode smart grid scheduling for controllable energy generation,
   storage and consumption devices. The modeled neighborhood consists of
   modern, well-insulated terraced houses in a typical Dutch climate, each
   equipped with roof-mounted photovoltaic (PV) panels. The panels are
   sized to cover the daily electric demand during sunnier parts of the
   year where the heat demand is low. The system also includes a centrally
   placed combined heat and power (CHP) with hot water and electric
   storage, and controllable devices within the houses such as washing and
   dishwashing machines. The daily domestic hot water demand is supplied
   entirely by the central CHP. The investigation includes an estimation of
   system dimensions, e.g. PV, CHP and storage capacities based on daily
   supply and load profiles on top of the multi-level scheduling. Through

Abstract = {{In the past few years, the integration of energy storage (ES) systems
   into power distribution networks has rapidly increased. Before deploying
   ES systems, it is imperative to estimate the largest ES capacity a given
   circuit can accommodate without resulting in any undesirable impacts on
   system operations. The obtained ES size is called circuit's ES
   accommodation capacity. Since calculating ES accommodation capacity
   requires evaluating a large number of scenarios for multiple grid
   integration issues, simple analytical methods are called for. This paper
   develops circuit analysis based analytical methods to determine
   distribution system's ES accommodation capacities. The results obtained
   using the proposed approach are validated against those obtained using
   detailed three-phase distribution system simulations. We conclude that
   the proposed method accurately estimates ES accommodation limits.
   Moreover, since the approach is based on analytical calculations, it is
   easily scalable to larger distribution systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the compact size and low profile integration passive
   device (IPD) diplexer is designed based on IPD process. The overall size
   of IPD diplexer is 1.0mm by 0.5mm with thickness less than 0.3mm with
   solder ball. Through electromagnetic (EM) solver, the insertion loss on
   low-band and high-band is below 1dB and better than LTCC solution. In
   addition, its attenuation is excellent compared to LTCC component. In
   real applications, a wireless system-in-package (SiP) module is designed
   by using the IPD diplexer. The simulated insertion loss of low and high
   channels not only shows better electrical performance, but also has a
   more compact size than LTCC solution.}},

Abstract = {{The application of memristors in logic operations have recently gained
   importance and are being investigated. The work presented in this paper
   describes a new low power technique of using memristors to perform
   arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication. It focuses on
   reducing the hardware costs and associated design complexity. The idea
   of ``logic implication{''} is combined with an analog technique of using
   current mirrors to perform logic operations. By using current mirrors,
   the problem of limited fan-out of logic implication can be overcome,
   enabling more parallel operations to run together. The delay for even an
   XOR operation can be reduced to 1 cycle, compared to the 5 cycles taken
   by logic implication. The design of a full adder, ripple carry adder and
   array multiplier are described. Metrics of area and latency are compared
   to previous works.}},

Abstract = {{Energy-efficient processing of large matrices for big-data applications
   using hardware acceleration is an intense area of research. Sketching of
   large matrices into their lower-dimensional representations is an
   effective strategy. For the first time, this paper develops a highly
   energy-efficient hardware implementation of a class of sketching methods
   based on random projections, known as Johnson Lindenstrauss (JL)
   transform. Crucially, we show how the randomness inherent in the
   projection matrix can be exploited to create highly efficient
   fixed-point arithmetic realizations of several machine-learning
   applications. Specifically, the transform's random matrices have two key
   properties that allow for significant energy gains in hardware
   implementations. The first is the smoothing property that allows us to
   drastically reduce operand bit-width in computation of the JL transform
   itself. The second is the randomizing property that allows bit-width
   reduction in subsequent machine-learning applications. Further, we
   identify a random matrix construction method that exploits the special
   sparsity structure to result in the most hardware-efficient realization
   and implement the highly optimized transform on an FPGA.
   Experimental results on (1) the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification
   and (2) the principal component analysis (PCA) show that with the same
   bit-width the proposed flow utilizing random projection achieves an up
   to 7X improvement in both latency and energy. Furthermore, by exploiting
   the smoothing and randomizing properties we are able to use a 1-bit
   instead of a 4-bit multiplier within KNN, which results in additional
   50\% and 6\% improvement in area and energy respectively. The proposed
   I/O streaming strategy along with the hardware-efficient JL algorithm
   identified by us is able to achieve a 50\% runtime reduction, a 17\%
   area reduction in the stage of random projection compared to a standard
   design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers robot motion planning under temporal logic
   constraints in probabilistic maps obtained by semantic simultaneous
   localization and mapping (SLAM). The uncertainty in a map distribution
   presents a great challenge for obtaining correctness guarantees with
   respect to the linear temporal logic (LTL) specification. We show that
   the problem can be formulated as an optimal control problem in which
   both the semantic map and the logic formula evaluation are stochastic.
   Our first contribution is to reduce the stochastic control problem for a
   subclass of LTL to a deterministic shortest path problem by introducing
   a confidence parameter delta. A robot trajectory obtained from the
   deterministic problem is guaranteed to have minimum cost and to satisfy
   the logic specification in the true environment with probability delta.
   Our second contribution is to design an admissible heuristic function
   that guides the planning in the deterministic problem towards satisfying
   the temporal logic specification. This allows us to obtain an optimal
   and very efficient solution using the A{*} algorithm. The performance
   and correctness of our approach are demonstrated in a simulated semantic
   environment using a differential-drive robot.}},

Abstract = {{A novel surface integral equation (IE) formulation for
   magneto-quasi-static analysis of current flow in two-dimensional
   conductors situated in lossy layered substrates is proposed. Traditional
   approach is based on the volume IE formulated with respect to the
   unknown current distribution in the conductors cross-section. In this
   work, we transform the volume IE to a surface IE via representation of
   the volumetric current density as a superposition of the waves emanating
   from the conductors boundaries. The resulting surface IE features a
   single unknown surface current density unlike the traditional surface
   IEs which require both electric and magnetic surface current densities.
   Also, the resultant single-source surface IE formulation involves only
   the electric field Greens functions instead of both electric and
   magnetic field Greens functions as required by the traditional surface
   IE formulations. The latter property makes the proposed IE formulation
   particularly suitable for analysis of current flow in conductors
   embedded in lossy layered substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Front end planning (FEP) is broadly viewed as an essential practice for
   project success. As a key deliverable of FEP, the project execution plan
   (PEP) is a fundamental document to guide project execution from design
   through construction and turnover to the client. However, the alignment
   aspects of PEPs are understudied. Construction Industry Institute (CII)
   research team (RT) 310 studied PEPs and found they lack provisions
   related to alignment. The research team identified 23 PEP elements
   central to alignment and surveyed 200 construction professionals to
   determine the criticality and frequency of the competent inclusion of
   these elements in capital projects. Summary results are that all 23
   elements are important to alignment (one just slightly below an
   important score) and that the 23 elements are also not commonly included
   in PEPs in a competent manner. The survey included both owner and
   contractor organizations in the North American industrial construction
   sector. While there are small differences between owner and contractor
   responses, overall findings show common results that the industry
   strongly regards the 23 identified elements as important to project
   alignment. Similarly, there is common perception that the 23 elements
   are not included in PEPs in a competent manner on a consistent basis.
   Consequently, the PEP elements identified by the research provide an
   immediate set of action points for industry improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Even though there are numerous planning tools and templates, projects
   still experience costly stops or holds. Moreover, since at least one
   stakeholder on virtually every project benefits from a premature start
   to construction, project teams nearly always feel pressure to begin
   construction-whether or not they are in fact ready. When a project
   starts construction prematurely, the result is frequently that it
   experiences an interruption to construction at least once. Complicating
   matters, when projects experience these stops and starts, project teams
   often seem to react rather than take a proactive management approach.
   Research in this area is dated and generally more focused on project
   readiness, effects of field rework, project change management,
   cost/schedule controls than on actual investigation of premature starts.
   New research is needed to better document premature starts and their
   impacts. The purpose of this paper is to describe the process used to
   identify and document leading indicators, drivers, and impacts of
   premature starts to construction using qualitative case study based
   research and quantitative survey based research. Common factors that can
   be seen on multiple projects of various scope definition, industry
   sector, and total project value were identified. Examples of drivers
   include time to market, seasonal and weather constraints, and contractor
   mobilization to start billing. Leading indicator factors that were also
   discovered include incomplete engineering documentation, unclear project
   objectives, and contract terms that incentivize early mobilization.
   Likelihood of these items occurring were quantified through survey based
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Ensuring quality in a design deliverable is important and affects
   overall construction project performance. However, there has been
   insufficient study into which types of deliverables present the greatest
   quality challenges. To address this issue, the Construction Industry
   Institute initiated Research Team 320 to develop definitions and
   measurements of the quality of engineering/design deliverables. The
   primary focus of this paper is to prioritize engineering/design
   deliverables and to identify the most problematic deliverables. The
   researchers conducted a literature review, which identified 53 types of
   common engineering/design deliverables. The team then determined that 11
   design deliverables are particularly problematic when it comes to
   quality. This was based on a survey of 67 industry professionals
   involved in design and/or quality management. Analyzing 53 deliverables,
   the team found both similarities and discrepancies in relative frequency
   of design quality problems between owners and contractors. The 11 most
   problematic deliverables include (1) P \& IDs; (2) Constructability
   Input; (3) Vendor Data; (4) Maintainability Input; (5) Level 3 Baseline
   Schedule; (6) Equipment Specifications; (7) Piping Routing and
   Isometrics; (8) 3D models; (9) FEED Validation; (10)
   Nozzles/Ladders/Platforms for Towers/Vessels/Tanks; and (11)
   Miscellaneous Pipe Support Drawings. Defects in these 11 problematic
   deliverables should be analyzed to substantially enhance overall project
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Water sector infrastructures are interdependent, affecting the
   performance, and operations of each infrastructure. Demands placed on,
   and revenues generated for these systems are impacted by human
   interactions, including price elasticity and consumption. Population
   decline in shrinking cities has resulted in reduced numbers of
   customers, leading to underfunded and underutilized systems. This paper
   develops a hybrid agent based and system dynamics model for quantifying
   coupled human and water sector infrastructure interdependencies in
   shrinking cities to explore: water demand, wastewater produced, water
   utility revenues, and wastewater utility revenues. Data is used from two
   shrinking cities, published literature, publicly available data, and a
   survey deployed to residents of 21 shrinking cities to assess water
   sector interdependencies for small and medium size classifications of
   cities and cities operating on combined or separate sewer systems, using
   two Midwestern shrinking cities. This study's significance includes
   quantifying the endogenous, physical water sector interdependencies, and
   the exogenous, complex human-infrastructure interactions. The epistemic
   uncertainty associated with human-infrastructure interactions is
   explored by incorporating stochastic parameters, enabling the estimation
   of the range of possible outcomes. Furthermore, the model enables the
   assessment of interdependencies with parameters tailored to a city's
   unique characteristics, such as population decline rate, service prices,
   and precipitation patterns.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of real-time applications with compute and/or
   communication deadlines are being supported on shared infrastructure.
   Such applications can often tolerate occasional deadline violations
   without substantially impacting their Quality of Service (QoS). A
   fundamental problem in such systems is deciding how to allocate shared
   resources so as to meet applications' QoS requirements. A simple
   framework to address this problem is to, (1) dynamically prioritize
   users as a possibly complex function of their deficits (difference of
   achieved vs required QoS), and (2) allocate resources so to expedite
   users with higher priority. This paper focuses on a general class of
   systems using such priority-based resource allocation. We first
   characterize the set of feasible QoS requirements and show the
   optimality of max weight-like prioritization. We then consider simple
   weighted Largest Deficit First (w-LDF) prioritization policies, where
   users with higher weighted QoS deficits are given higher priority. The
   paper gives an inner bound for the feasible set under w-LDF policies,
   and, under an additional monotonicity assumption, characterizes its
   geometry leading to a sufficient condition for optimality. Additional
   insights on the efficiency ratio of w-LDF policies, the optimality of
   hierarchical-LDF and characterization of clustering of failures are also
   discussed.}},

   of Service (QoS) constraints on failures to meet processing deadlines.
   We develop a general outer bound on the feasible QoS region for
   non-clairvoyant resource allocation policies, and an inner bound for a
   natural class of policies based on dynamically prioritizing
   applications' tasks by favoring those with the largest (QoS) deficits.
   This provides an avenue to study the efficiency of two natural resource
   allocation policies: (1) priority-based greedy task scheduling for
   applications with variable workloads, and (2) priority-based task
   selection and optimal scheduling for applications with deterministic
   workloads. The near-optimality of these simple policies emerges when
   task processing deadlines are relatively large and/or when the number of
   compute resources is large. Analysis and simulations show substantial
   resource savings for such policies over reservation-based designs.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc-based rechargeable batteries with two-electron transfer are
   promising for large-scale energy storage systems. However, the use of
   zinc metal in practical cells has been challenging due to the formation

   high-capacity zinc-insertion-compound anode ZnxMo2.5+yVO9+z by inserting
   Zn2+ into an open-tunnel oxide host with a novel chemical Zn-insertion
   technique. The ultrafast chemical Zn-insertion is performed in ambient
   atmosphere with diethylene glycol (DEG) and zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)(2))
   within 30 min. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   Zn-containing insertion anode ever reported. ZnxMo2.5+yVO9+z can be used
   as an anode in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes for Zn-based
   batteries, with a capacity as high as 220 mA h g(-1).}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of centimeter-accurate carrier-phase differential GNSS
   (CDGNSS) positioning using a smartphone's internal GNSS antenna and GNSS
   chip is investigated. Precise positioning on a mass-market platform
   would significantly influence the world economy, ushering in a host of
   consumer-focused applications that have so far been hampered by the
   several-meter-level errors in traditional GNSS positioning. Previous
   work has shown that GNSS signals received through a mass-market
   smartphone's GNSS antenna can be processed to yield a
   centimeter-accurate CDGNSS position solution, but this earlier work
   processed all GNSS signals externally to the smartphone. The question
   remains whether a smartphone's internal oscillator and GNSS chip can
   produce observables of sufficient quality to support centimeter-accurate
   carrier-phase-based positioning. This paper answers the question by
   accessing and processing the raw code-and carrierphase observables
   produced by a mass-market smartphone GNSS chip-observables that have
   heretofore been unavailable to the research community. The phone's
   carrier phase measurements are shown to suffer from five anomalies
   compared to those from a survey-grade GNSS receiver, four of which are
   readily fixed in post-processing. The remaining anomaly, an error in the
   phase measurement that grows approximately linearly with time, currently
   prevents the phone's phase measurements from satisfying the conditions
   for CDGNSS positioning. But the phone's measurements seem otherwise
   fully capable of supporting cm-accurate carrier-phase differential GNSS
   positioning. A separate analysis of a smartphone's GNSS signal strength
   dependency on azimuth and elevation reveals that multipath-induced deep
   fading and large phase errors remain a significant challenge for
   centimeter-accurate smartphone positioning.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of atmospheric corrections provided by a dense reference
   network for centimeter-accurate carrierphase differential GNSS (CDGNSS)
   positioning is investigated. A dense reference network (less than 20 km
   inter-station distance) offers significant benefits for mass-market
   users, enabling lowcost (including single-frequency) CDGNSS positioning
   with rapid integer ambiguity resolution. Precise positioning on a
   massmarket platform would significantly influence the world economy,
   ushering in a host of consumer-focused applications such as
   globally-registered augmented and virtual reality and improved
   all-weather safety and efficiency for intelligent transportation
   systems, applications which have so far been hampered by the
   several-meter-level errors in standard GNSS positioning. This
   contribution examines CDGNSS integer ambiguity resolution performance in
   terms of network correction uncertainty, and network correction
   uncertainty, in turn, in terms of network density. It considers the
   total error in network corrections: a sum of ionospheric, tropospheric,
   and reference station multipath components. The paper's primary goal is
   to identify the network density beyond which mass-market users would see
   no further significant improvement in ambiguity resolution performance.
   It finishes by describing development and deployment of a low-cost dense

Abstract = {{Time transfer is the backbone of all technologies that require
   synchronization between stations. Wireless time transfer protocols
   generally employ simple and convenient one-way communication for
   synchronization of different nodes. However, it is argued that all
   one-way wireless time transfer protocols are fundamentally vulnerable to
   replay attacks that compromise timing information. Necessary conditions
   for security of a two-way time transfer protocol are proposed and proved
   by contradiction. Furthermore, an example compliant system is presented
   in detail. The uncertainty in estimation of tropospheric delay using
   common climatological models is studied and its effect on the accuracy
   of one-way time transfer and security of two-way time transfer is
   presented. Analysis of these models suggest they are adequate for
   nanosecond-level accurate time transfer over links that are shorter than
   10 km, but more sophisticated weather estimation techniques are needed
   if this accuracy is to be achieved over long distances.}},

Abstract = {{Modern broadband wireless networks support application mixes, with
   different, possibly complex, application/user Quality of
   Service/Experience (QoS/QoE) metrics. The central problem underlying
   resource allocation for such systems is realizing QoS/QoE trade-offs
   given the dynamic loads and capacity variability they would typically
   see. The paper explores a framework for context-aware scheduling based
   on: (1) context-aware flow classification and management, and (2),
   complementary base station scheduler. Motivated by typical flow-size
   distributions for current traffic and characteristics of the associated
   delay optimal (Gittins index-based) schedulers we propose a novel flow
   and channel-aware scheduler which meets our design objectives. Using a
   combination of analysis and simulation we explore the achieved QoS/QoE
   trade-offs across a dynamic mix of traffic, in particular: 1) mobile web
   browsing and small file delays; 2) stored streaming video quality vs
   re-buffering; 3) throughput of larger file downloads. They suggest
   improved QoS/QoE trade-offs vs traditional proportionally fair
   schedulers and are robust to the network load.}},

Abstract = {{MmWave based wearable networks will need to function in various
   environments including possibly high density settings, e.g., train cars.
   At such densities one might expect challenges in interference management
   and/or excessive overheads tracking and jointly scheduling interferers.
   In this paper we use simple stochastic geometric models to examine the
   characteristics (number and sensitivity to motion) of ``strong
   interferers{''} and show that due to blocking they are not monotonic in
   user density. Indeed, perhaps surprisingly, the most challenging setting
   appears to arise at ``intermediate{''} user densities. We then propose a
   simple model to evaluate the performance of current MAC designs based on
   clustering and hierarchical scheduling. The results exhibit a
   performance trade-off leading to an optimal cluster size which depends
   on the directionality of transmissions. More importantly, we show that
   at high densities the per user throughput is roughly constant,
   suggesting wearable networks will scale well in dense scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art D2D schedulers' performance can be evaluated from at
   least two different perspectives: the sum throughput and the fraction of
   satisfied users/applications. In this paper we revisit the performance
   of such schedulers, e.g., FlashLinQ/ITLinQ, showing they strike
   particular trade-offs between these two metrics. Our analysis and
   simulations show that the sum-rate benefits of such schedulers come at
   the expense of fairness, which under high densities can lead to a
   substantial fraction of unsatisfied users. This motivates a proposed
   opportunistic scheduler design, Binary Quantile (BQ) scheduling, which
   further exploits temporal channel variations via a low overhead
   distributed mechanisms and realizes substantial improvements in
   user/application performance. We further show that an adapting version
   of BQ scheduling where link quantile thresholds are adjusted based on
   achieved throughput can further achieve substantial improvement in
   user/application level satisfaction which is robust to heterogeneity in
   the network topology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a stochastic geometry framework to study the
   temporal performance variations experienced by a mobile user in a
   cellular network. The focus is on the variations of the Signal to Noise
   Ratio (SNR) and the downlink Shannon rate experienced when the user
   moves across Poisson cellular network of the Euclidean plane. The motion
   is the simplest possible i.e., a user moving at a constant velocity on a
   straight line. The level crossings of the associated SNR process are
   shown to form an alternating-renewal process. The two distributions
   characterizing this process are derived in closed form. The theory of
   rare events provides simplified expressions for the law of this process
   for extremes (very large and very small) SNR thresholds. The framework
   is then leveraged to predict the quality of service experienced by
   mobile users in two concrete scenarios: that of streaming a video on the
   downlink and partially buffered on the hand-set to prevent video
   freezing; and that of downloading a large file, where the main question
   is the download delay. Finally, discrete event simulation is used to
   assess practical use of this model on its robustness to perturbations
   that cannot presently be taken into account in the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Memory system reliability is a serious concern in many systems today,
   and is becoming more worrisome as technology scales and system size
   grows. Stronger fault tolerance capability is therefore desirable, but
   often comes at high cost. In this paper, we propose a low-cost,
   fault-aware, hardware-only resilience mechanism, RelaxFault, that
   repairs the vast majority of memory faults using a small amount of the
   LLC to remap faulty memory locations. RelaxFault requires less than
   100KiB of LLC capacity, has near-zero impact on performance and power.
   By repairing faults, RelaxFault relaxes the requirement for high fault
   tolerance of other mechanisms, such as ECC. A better tradeoff between
   resilience and overhead is made by exploiting an understanding of memory
   system architecture and fault characteristics. We show that RelaxFault
   provides better repair capability than prior work of similar cost,
   improves memory reliability to a greater extent, and significantly
   reduces the number of maintenance events and memory module replacements.
   We also propose a more refined memory fault model than prior work and
   demonstrate its importance.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging of physiological functions using magnetic resonance imaging is
   limited due its slow data acquisition speed. Previously various
   techniques based on data sharing in the spatiotemporal k-space or sparse
   recovery methods have been proposed to increase imaging speeds in
   dynamic MRI. This paper presents a novel formulation for fast dynamic
   MRI which combines the generic linear dynamical system based
   spatiotemporal model with sparse recovery techniques. Specifically, the
   formulation uses a known prior time-evolution model for the
   physiological function implicitly and enforces the model errors
   (innovations) to be sparse. The preliminary results of dynamic MRI
   recovery experiments on an in-vivo myocardial perfusion dataset show
   that the proposed approach preserves details like edges and fine
   structures in recovered images better than previous k-space data-sharing
   and sparse recovery techniques individually.}},

   matrix by the product of two matrices - one capturing meaningful

   decomposition that arises in haplotype assembly, an important problem in
   genomics. The observed matrix contains noisy samples of the product of
   an informative matrix with rows having entries from a finite alphabet

   Structurally-constrained gradient descent algorithm for finding the two

Abstract = {{We investigate the performance of wideband massive MIMO base stations
   that use one-bit ADCs for quantizing the uplink signal. Our main result
   is to show that the many taps of the frequency-selective channel make
   linear combiners asymptotically consistent and the quantization noise
   additive and Gaussian, which simplifies signal processing and enables
   the straightforward use of OFDM. We also find that single-carrier
   systems and OFDM systems are affected in the same way by one-bit
   quantizers in wideband systems because the distribution of the
   quantization noise becomes the same in both systems as the number of
   channel taps grows.}},

   are many orders of magnitude larger than in other nonlinear setups, and,
   at the same time, capable of controlling the local phase of the
   nonlinear signal with high precision and subwavelength resolution. The
   key to achieving such outstanding performance is combining a strong
   local field enhancement and polarization selectivity of plasmonic
   nano-antennas with extremely high nonlinearity of multi-quantum well
   semiconductor stacks. In this work, we discuss the operation principles
   of such metasurfaces and provide experimental and numerical results. We

   allows for fast and efficient analysis and modeling of such metasurfaces

Abstract = {{Modern computer systems typically conbine multicore CPUs with
   accelerators like GPUs for inproved performance and energy efficiency.
   However, these systems suffer from poor performance portability - code
   tuned for one device must be retuned to achieve high performance on
   another. Image processing is increasing in importance, with applications
   ranging from seismology and medicine to Photoshop.
   Based on our experience with medical image processing, we propose
   ImageCL, a high-level domain-specific language and source-to-source
   compiler, targeting heterogeneous hardware. ImageCL resembles OpenCL,
   but abstracts away performance optimization details, allowing the
   programmer to focus on algorithm development, rather than performance
   tuning. The latter is left to our source-to-source compiler and
   auto-tuner. From high-level ImageCL kernels, our source-to-source
   compiler can generate multiple OpenCL implementations with different
   optimizations applied. We rely on auto-tuning rather than machine models
   or expert programmer knowledge to determine which optimizations to
   apply, making our tuning procedure highly robust. Furthermore, we can
   generate high performing implementations for different devices from a
   single source code, thereby improving performance portability.
   We evaluate our approach on three image processing benchmarks, on
   different GPU and CPU devices, and are able to outperform other state of
   the art solutions in several cases, achieving speedups of up to 4.57x.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate an energy-reduction strategy that exploits
   the stochastic switching characteristics of STT-RAM write operation and
   propose a multiple-attempt write technique needed for it. In contrast to
   the traditional approach which uses the pulse that guarantees writes for
   all cells, the proposed technique uses multiple short pulses.
   Individually, these pulses result in high probability of write error
   therefore multiple attempts are made until a successful write for all
   bits. Average write energy is significantly reduced because the average
   write duration is far shorter than the worst-case duration. We developed
   a self-validation write circuit that allows bit-wise validation and
   current deactivation without adding energy and area overhead. We
   evaluated the proposed circuit using a compact STT-RAM model targeting
   an implementation in a 10nm technology node. Results indicate that the
   proposed architecture reduces write energy by 94.6\% compared to the
   conventional design. Compared to the best previously known architectures
   that rely on write-read-verify strategy we reduce write energy by 2.1x
   without area overhead.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates the influence of input parameters in the
   direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the simulation of a
   hypersonic flow scenario. Simulations are performed using the
   Computation of Hypersonic Ionizing Particles in Shocks (CHIPS) code to
   reproduce NASA Ames Electric Arc Shock Tube ( EAST) experimental results
   for a 10.26 km/s, 0.2 Torr scenario. Since the chosen nominal simulation
   involves an energetic flow, an electronic excitation model is introduced
   into CHIPS to complement the pre-existing 11-species air models. A
   global Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis was completed for this chosen
   scenario and three quantities of interest (QoIs) were investigated:
   translational temperature, electronic temperature, and electron number
   density. The electron impact ionization reaction, N + e(-) reversible
   arrow N+ + e(-) + e(-), was determined to have the greatest effect on
   all three QoIs as it defines the electron cascade that occurs
   post-shock. In addition, molecular nitrogen dissociation, associative
   ionization, and the N + NO+ reversible arrow N+ + NO charge exchange
   reaction were all found to be important for these QoIs.}},

Abstract = {{Jupiters moon Io supports its rarefied atmosphere with prolific
   tidally-driven episodic volcanism. Its largest volcanic plumes erupt
   violently and exhibit intricate structure, their canopies rising to
   hundreds of km above the Ionian surface. In early 2007, the NASA New
   Horizons (NH) spacecraft captured the active Tvashtar plume in a time
   sequence of panchromatic images at high spatial resolution and observed
   both discrete filamentary patterns in the descending particulate
   structure, and a prominent traveling canopy wave. These are transient
   and asymmetric features, indicative of Tvashtars unresolved and complex
   vent processes. In this work, we introduce a methodology for identifying
   vent spatial and temporal scales in the rarefied plume.
   Three-dimensional DSMC simulations of the collisional gas flowfield are
   combined with a flow-tracking dust particle model, enabling a broad
   exploration of parameter space in pursuit of the critical frequencies
   that qualitatively reproduce the dynamical phenomena observed in
   Tvashtars collisional canopy and providing insight into the dynamics of
   transient extra-terrestrial volcanic plumes.}},

Abstract = {{We extend the discrete velocity method for solving the Boltzmann
   equation previously used for one-dimensional problems to two spatial
   dimensions. The collision integral is computed using collisions between
   velocity classes selected randomly using a Monte Carlo method. Arbitrary
   post-collision velocities are mapped back onto the grid using a
   projection scheme which conserves mass, momentum, and energy. In
   addition, a variance reduction scheme is implemented to decrease noise
   and further reduce computational effort. The convection part of the
   equation is computed using first order upwind finite differences. We
   apply this discrete velocity scheme to the 2D lid-driven square cavity
   flow problem with Ar as the fluid medium and explore the effect of the
   additional flexibility available in this quasi-particle based stochastic
   method on the accuracy and noise level in the solutions obtained.}},

Abstract = {{In this review article, we discuss some recent developments in the
   context of the use of block copolymers (BCP) as compatibilizers in
   ternary blend organic photovoltaic devices. At the outset, we review
   some of the salient experimental studies and highlight the successes
   achieved in using BCPs to improve the long-term stability of the
   donor-acceptor based devices. We suggest that the
   physico-electro-chemical properties of BCP compatibilizers may be
   targeted as a hitherto less-explored handle to modulate the morphology
   and device characteristics of such systems. In this regard, we propose
   that coarse-grained computer simulation tools, despite being limited in
   their ability to capture complex interaction features and
   crystallization phenomena, can serve as a guide to narrow and/or
   identify parametric regions where morphologies desirable for better
   exciton and charge transport can be achieved. Furthermore, we suggest
   that the output of the morphological predictions can be combined with
   coarse-grained device simulation approaches to identify the overall
   photovoltaic properties of the ternary blends containing such BCP
   compatibilizers. Together, such computational studies can serve to
   connect the molecular structure and electronic properties of the BCP to
   the overall device properties and, thereby, to enable a rational
   molecular design of BCP compatibilizers for organic photovoltaic
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Doped BiVO4 is a promising photoelectrochemical water splitting anode,
   whose activity is hampered by poor charge transport. Here we use a set
   of X-ray spectroscopic methods to probe the origin and nature of
   localized electron states in W: BiVO4. Furthermore, using the polarized
   nature of the X-rays, we probe variations in the electronic structure
   along the crystal axes. In this manner, we reveal aspects of the
   electronic structure related to electron localization and observations
   consistent with conductivity anisotropy between the ab-plane and c-axis.
   We verify that tungsten substitutes as W6+ for V5+ in BiVO4. This is
   shown to result in the presence of inter-band gap states related to
   electrons at V4+ sites of e symmetry. The energetic position of the
   states in the band gap suggest that they are highly localized and may
   act as recombination centres. Polarization dependent X-ray absorption
   spectra reveal anisotropy in the electronic structure between the
   ab-plane and c-axis. Results show the superior hybridization between V
   3d and O 2p states, higher V wavefunction overlap and broader conduction
   bands in the ab-plane than in the c-axis. These insights into the
   electronic structure are discussed in the context of existing
   experimental and theoretical reports regarding charge transport in
   BiVO4.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{667-674}},
Abstract = {{Mo2C catalysts have been widely studied for methane reforming reactions.
   One of the proposed mechanisms for Mo2C catalysts is a redox type
   mechanism that includes active participation of the carbide carbon in
   the reaction. While evidence for this mechanism has been provided by
   several studies, one of the most surprising results previously reported
   asserts that a stream of pure methane can undergo significant, facile
   carbon exchange with the Mo2C catalyst at temperatures above 550 degrees
   C. Using pulses of (CH4)-C-13, we have found no evidence of carbon
   exchange between methane and Mo2C, even at 800 degrees C, in contrast to
   these previous results. In addition, by using pulses of CD4, we have
   found evidence of a small degree of dissociative methane adsorption at
   800 degrees C, involving the breaking and reforming of a single
   methane-hydrogen/deuterium bond. While the present study does not
   contradict the model of active carbide carbon participation via a redox
   mechanism in methane reforming reactions, it doesn't support the notion
   of significant and facile carbon exchange between methane and Mo2C
   without an oxidant.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating high proportions of residential photo-voltaics (PV) in the
   distribution grid may potentially disrupt the nominal circuit operating
   conditions and result in power quality issues. The maximum PV capacity

   hosting capacity mandates grid upgrades and additional investments. The
   objective of this paper is to evaluate the PV hosting capacity of the
   distribution grid with zero or minimum cost of PV integration in the
   grid. Using a stochastic analysis framework and quasi-static load flow
   simulations, the impacts of high PV penetration on the distribution grid
   are evaluated. The analysis includes the effectiveness of existing
   voltage regulation equipment namely load tap-changing (LTC) transformer
   and capacitors in eliminating the steady-state problems such as feeder
   overvoltages and voltage deviations. The study is carried out on three
   distribution circuits, and the results indicate that the hosting
   capacity of the circuits can be increased significantly while incurring
   a minimal cost to the grid.}},

Abstract = {{The power swing phenomenon is characterized by oscillations in power
   flow between two areas of a power system due to an abrupt imbalance in
   mechanical and electrical power. Unintentional operation of distance
   relays during power swings can propagate a disturbance and result in a
   cascading outage. It is therefore critical that relays operate securely
   under such conditions. Modern distance relays can provide a function for
   power swing blocking (PSB). However, the PSB settings can be difficult
   to calculate without extensive stability studies and may fail to block
   if the slip frequency is too fast. In this work, we investigate the
   application of a model-based relaying framework applied to power swing
   blocking. The framework is named Model-Based Distributed Intelligence
   (MBDI) because it integrates, at the relay level, real-time knowledge of
   the network structure and system state in the form of simulation circuit
   models. We investigate the efficacy of a relay equipped with MBDI to
   supervise PSB operation during power swing and fault scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers offers a promising
   route for scaling feature sizes below 20 nm. At these small dimensions,
   plasmas are often used to define the initial patterns. It is imperative
   to understand how plasmas interact with each block in order to design
   processes with sufficient etch contrast and pattern fidelity. Symmetric
   lamella forming block copolymers including, polystyrene-b-poly(methyl
   methacrylate) and several high-chi silicon-containing and tin-containing
   block copolymers were synthesized, along with homopolymers of each
   block, and exposed to various oxidizing, reducing, and fluorine-based
   plasma processes. Etch rate kinetics were measured, and plasma
   modifications of the materials were characterized using XPS, AES, and
   FTIR. Mechanisms for achieving etch contrast were elucidated and were
   highly dependent on the block copolymer architecture. For several of the
   polymers, plasma photoemissions were observed to play an important role
   in modifying the materials and forming etch-resistant protective layers.
   Furthermore, it was observed for the silicon-and tin-containing polymers
   that an initial transient state exists, where the polymers exhibit an
   enhanced etch rate, prior to the formation of the etch-resistant
   protective layer. Plasma developed patterns were demonstrated for the
   differing block copolymer materials with feature sizes ranging from 20
   nm down to approximately 5 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Thin films of copper tungstate (CuWO4)have been prepared through
   electrodeposition and tested as the anode material for
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. We found that
   hydrogen-treatment over the synthesized CuWO4 at high temperatures led
   to enhancement in the PEC performance for water oxidation. The origin of
   this activity enhancement is attributed to the enhanced kinetics of
   electron-hole pair separation due to the increased carrier concentration
   induced by oxygen vacancy formation upon hydrogen-treatment. The
   incorporation of oxygen vacancies also resulted in enhanced light
   absorbance in the visible light region because they introduce shallow
   donors as predicted by first-principles calculations. Nevertheless,
   incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements
   indicate that light absorbed at long wavelength region after
   hydrogen-treatment is not successfully utilized to oxidize water. This
   report provides insights on the effect of hydrogen-treatment on the
   structural, optical, and electronic properties of CuWO4. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Shifts in Long-Distance Travel Mode Due to Automated Vehicles Statewide
   Mode-Shift Simulation Experiment and Travel Survey Analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2566}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{Although vehicle automation technology has experienced rapid gains in
   recent years, little research has been conducted on the potential
   impacts of self-driving vehicles on long-distance personal travel, a
   major area of travel growth in the United States. Automated vehicles
   (AVs) offer flexible trip time and origin destination pairings at travel
   time costs perceived to be lower; thus, AVs have the potential to
   dramatically change how travelers pursue long-distance tours. This study
   analyzed travel surveys and then developed a statewide simulation
   experiment of long-distance travel to anticipate the impact of AVs on
   long-distance travel choices. The research explored the Michigan State
   2009 Long-Distance Travel Survey and estimated a long-distance trip
   generation model and a modal-agnostic long-distance mode-choice model.
   These models were applied in a statewide simulation experiment in which
   AVs were introduced as a new mode with lower perceived travel time costs
   (via lowered values of travel time en route) and higher travel costs (to
   reflect the initially high price of complete vehicle automation). This
   experiment highlighted the potential shifts in mode choices across
   different trip distances and purposes. For travel of less than 500 mi,
   AVs tended to draw from the use of personal vehicles and airlines
   equally. Airlines were estimated to remain preferred for distances
   greater than 500 mi (43.6\% of trips greater than 500 mi were by air,
   and 70.9\% of trips greater than 1,000 mi were by air). Additionally, at
   certain AV travel time valuations, travel cost was not a significant
   factor. The findings showed that as the perceived travel time benefits
   from hands-free travel rose, monetary costs became less important.}},

Abstract = {{Of the three dimensions of sustainability-environmental, economic, and
   social-the social aspect is often the least well understood. However,
   social acceptance is a prerequisite to social sustainability: if a
   technology is rejected by a society or its members, it is not viable.
   Social acceptability can be studied using well-known survey techniques,
   and the information gathered can inform further efforts to understand
   the social sustainability of technologies. Eco-toilets (composting and
   urine diversion toilets) provide an excellent example of a technology
   that appears to be environmentally and economically sustainable,
   according to various measures, but might not be socially viable. In this
   research, preliminary analyses of some economic and environmental
   measures were followed by a household questionnaire to examine the
   social acceptability of eco-toilets. The questionnaire instrument was
   designed specifically for this purpose and queries attitudes,
   perceptions, and beliefs surrounding eco-toilets themselves as well as
   other related areas, such as risk and sensitivity to disgust. This
   instrument was implemented in a case study in coastal Massachusetts,
   where eco-toilets have been proposed as one potential solution to
   environmental pollution problems caused in large part by household
   sewage waste. Data collected with this questionnaire provide critical
   insight into factors influencing social acceptance of environmentally
   promising technologies. These insights can inform further efforts toward
   increasing social acceptance in the hope that eco-toilets could become a
   socially sustainable sanitation solution, or efforts toward inventing or
   selecting and evaluating alternative technologies that could sustainably
   meet household sanitation needs.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of the center of a fovea and its boundary from a retinal image
   is a challenging task due to the irregularity of the avascular foveal
   region. Several attempts have been made before in order to detect the
   foveal region and its boundary from fluorescein angiographic images. The
   irregularity and large variation in the human retinal images made the
   task increasingly difficult. In this current work funds images were
   considered instead of fluorescein angiographic images in order to ensure
   the applicability of the proposed algorithm in both biomedical and
   biometric analysis. A robust fuzzy-rule based image segmentation
   algorithm has been developed in order to extract the foveal region from
   awide variety of images from different persons. Detection of foveal
   region comprised of locating the geometric center and extracting the
   boundary. The geometric center was evaluated by weighted averaging the
   grey scale intensities obtained from implementing the current algorithm.
   Thiswas followed by applying gradient vector flow (GVF) based active
   contour technique in order to extract the boundary of the foveal region.
   The algorithm was applied on a several retinal images acquired from
   different persons with a very good success rate. The present work is
   considered to be an important contribution in intelligent image analysis
   of human retina since it incorporates a robust ``fuzzy-rule{''} in
   extracting foveal region. Similar approach has not been adopted in the
   literature. The proposed algorithm is seen to be versatile in analyzing
   a wide range of retinal images.}},

   XPS to be comprised of similar to 9 mol\% insoluble polysulfide species
   (mainly Li2S2) and similar to 91 mol\% Li2S. This material was
   discharged galvanostatically in an electrochemical cell and, despite the
   lack of soluble polysulfide species, was shown to exhibit a discharge
   plateau at similar to 2.1 V vs. Li/Li+. This result confirmed the
   electrochemical reducibility of electrolyte-insoluble polysulfides in
   Li-S batteries. Moreover, it was determined that the reduction of solid
   polysulfides was confined to areas where the sulfur-sulfur bonds were in
   intimate contact with the conductive current collector. Finally, it was
   observed that commercially available Li2S samples contain significant
   quantities of polysulfide-type impurities. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

Abstract = {{Molecular recognition is of paramount interest in many applications.
   Here we investigate a series of host-guest systems previously used in
   the SAMPL4 blind challenge by using molecular simulations and the AMOEBA
   polarizable force field. The free energy results computed by Bennett's
   acceptance ratio (BAR) method using the AMOEBA polarizable force field
   ranked favorably among the entries submitted to the SAMPL4 host-guest
   competition {[}Muddana, et al., J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des., 2014, 28,
   305-317]. In this work we conduct an in-depth analysis of the AMOEBA
   force field host-guest binding thermodynamics by using both BAR and the
   orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) methods. The binding
   entropy-enthalpy contributions are analyzed for each host-guest system.
   For systems of inordinate binding entropy-enthalpy values, we further
   examine the hydrogen bonding patterns and configurational entropy
   contribution. The binding mechanism of this series of host-guest systems
   varies from ligand to ligand, driven by enthalpy and/or entropy changes.
   Convergence of BAR and OSRW binding free energy methods is discussed.
   Ultimately, this work illustrates the value of molecular modelling and
   advanced force fields for the exploration and interpretation of binding
   thermodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{True stress-strain curves are needed for fracture simulation of
   structural steel using the finite element analysis method. This paper
   summarizes recent research on development of true stress-strain curves
   for ASTM A992 structural steel at ambient temperature and at elevated
   temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. Calibration of true stress-strain
   curves was based on measured engineering stress-strain curves of ASTM
   A992 steel obtained from isothermal tests for tension coupons at both
   ambient and elevated temperatures. Prior to necking, the true
   stress-strain curve was derived directly from the engineering
   stress-strain curves using well established equations. After the onset
   of necking, due to the non-uniform deformation and complex stress state
   in the necked region, the established equations are no longer valid.
   Thus, in this research, true stress-strain curves for the post-necking
   region were developed by calibrating detailed finite element models of
   the tested tension coupons to match measured engineering stress-strain
   curves. Comparisons are presented between measured engineering
   stress-strain curves and simulated results to examine the accuracy of
   the calibrated true stress-strain curves. Furthermore, generalized true
   stress-strain curves based on the derived curves are proposed for
   fracture simulations for ASTM A992 steel.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2567}},
Pages = {{87-94}},
Abstract = {{As the future of autonomous vehicles (AVs) becomes more certain,
   transport network managers may seek ways to reinvent elements of the
   traffic network to improve efficiency. One possibility is dynamic lane
   reversal, in which the network operator makes use of AV communications
   and behavior to change the direction of flow on a road link at smaller
   time intervals than would be possible with human drivers. Although there
   is much research into the mechanical details of AVs, this study
   motivates the need for future research by focusing on a planning
   application in which AVs are already present. A novel extension to an
   established system optimal dynamic traffic assignment model based on the
   cell transmission model was examined. The model determined the optimal
   lane configuration at small space time intervals. Results demonstrate
   the model on a single link and a grid network and explore the dynamic
   demand scenarios that are most conducive to increasing system efficiency
   with dynamic lane reversal.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic radiation force (ARF) has been used to generate shear waves in
   many different tissues for the purpose of quantifying material
   properties of those tissues. This method has also been applied to
   arteries, but care must be taken in this application because waves
   produced in the arterial wall are guided waves. To obtain accurate
   measurements of mechanical properties of arteries, guided wave inversion
   can be used, where experimental wave dispersion is iteratively matched
   with theoretical dispersion curves. In this paper we study wave
   propagation in three sets of rubber tubes with different mechanical
   properties, and compare their measured and theoretical dispersion
   curves. Three sets of tubes were made with outer diameters of 8 mm and
   wall thicknesses of 1 mm to mimic an adult carotid artery. A different
   rubber mixture was used for each set of tubes, VytaFlex 10, VytaFlex20,
   and ReoFlex 30. Reference samples were also poured for testing with
   hyperfrequency viscoelastic spectroscopy (HFVS) instrument for
   measurement of the material complex modulus. Wave propagation
   measurements were made with a Verasonics system and linear array with
   water inside and surrounding the tubes. Acoustic radiation force was
   used to generate the waves with a 200 mu s push at 4.1 MHz and plane
   wave imaging at a frame rate of 14.9 kHz was used for measuring the
   propagating waves. A two-dimensional Fourier transform method was used
   to extract the dispersion curves from the measured particle velocity.
   Theoretical dispersion curves for flexural modes with circumferential
   wavenumber n = 1, 2, 3 were calculated from the material properties
   measured with HFVS for comparison with the ultrasound-based results. The
   measured dispersion curve matches well with theoretical results.
   However, the match is not with a single theoretical dispersion curve,
   but with different theoretical curves at different frequencies. This new
   approach of matching with multiple theoretical curves can be used for
   better understanding of wave propagation in arterial walls and improved
   characterization of their mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Mg2Si1-xSnx solid solutions are promising thermoelectric materials to be
   applied in vehicle waste-heat recovery. Their thermal stability issue,
   however, needs to be addressed before the materials can be applied in
   practical thermoelectric devices. In this work, we studied the crystal
   structure and chemical composition of Mg2Si1-xSnx in inert gas
   atmosphere up to 823 K. We found that the sample was oxidized even in
   high-purity inert gases. Although no obvious structural change has been
   found in the slightly oxidized sample, carrier concentration decreased
   significantly since oxidation creates Mg vacancies in the lattice. We
   demonstrated that an atomic-layer deposited Al2O3 coating can
   effectively protect Mg2Si1-xSnx from oxidation in inert gases and even
   in air. In addition, this Al2O3 thin film also provides in situ
   protection to the Sb-doped Mg2Si1-xSnx samples during the laser-flash
   measurement and therefore eliminates the measurement error that occurs
   in uncoated samples as a result of sample oxidation and graphite
   exfoliation issues.}},

   Lessons Learned}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Abstract = {{The use of information modeling and digital data for highway projects
   has seen a considerable surge over the past decade. These tools have
   enhanced the predictability and performance of several tasks in the
   project delivery process. This study explores the implementation of
   civil integrated management (CIM) practices in four case studies and
   documents the lessons learned to enhance CIM inclusion in project
   delivery processes. CIM encompasses the system of interdependent
   technologies and practices that facilitate collection, management, and
   utilization of digital information for project delivery and asset
   management processes. CIM is an emerging practice, and studies
   concerning integration of CIM technologies with project life cycle are
   limited. Through case studies of four highway projects, this study
   emphasizes the standards and processes that played a vital role in
   utilizing CIM technologies for contract documentation, design
   coordination, construction automation, and project management. The two
   small-scale projects investigated as part of this study demonstrate that
   pilot initiatives could be successfully carried out to harvest best
   practices in overcoming contract and legal challenges while embracing
   new technologies in agencies' workflow. The two large-scale projects
   indicate that with the owner's participation and expertise, the role of
   CIM technologies can be further enhanced toward performing project
   management functions. The lessons learned from the case studies are
   organized to provide a synthesis of process and organizational
   considerations that would enhance the agencywide adoption of CIM
   technologies.}},

Title = {{Computation of Skims for Large-Scale Implementations of Integrated
   Activity-Based and Dynamic Traffic Assignment Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2563}},
Pages = {{134-143}},
Abstract = {{Integrated activity-based model (ABM) and dynamic traffic assignment
   (DTA) frameworks have emerged as promising tools to support
   transportation planning and operations, particularly in the context of
   novel technologies and data sources. This research proposes an approach
   to characterize the implementation of integrated ABM-DTA models and
   seeks to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of frameworks and,
   ultimately, the selection of appropriate tools. The importance of the
   dimensions considered in this characterization is illustrated through a
   detailed analysis of the computation of skims. Skims are the level of
   service (LOS) metric produced by DTA models, and the computation of
   skims may impact the performance and convergence of ABM-DTA
   applications. Numerical results from experiments on a regional ABM-DTA
   model in Austin, Texas, suggest that skims produced at relatively small
   time steps (10 to 30 min) may lead to a faster integrated model
   convergence. Finer time-grained skims are also observed to capture
   sharper temporal peaking patterns in the LOS. This work considers two
   skim computation methods; the analysis of the results suggests that
   simpler techniques are adequate, as the inherent variability of travel
   times from simulation overshadows any gain in precision from more
   complex methods. This study also uses promising techniques to visualize
   and analyze the model results, a challenging task in the context of
   highly disaggregate models and the subject of further research. The
   insights from this research effort can inform future research on the
   implementation of ABM-DTA methods and practical applications of existing
   frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the controller synthesis problem for
   multi-agent systems that consist of a set of controlled and uncontrolled
   agents. Controlled agents may need to cooperate with each other and
   react to the actions of uncontrolled agents in order to fulfill their
   objectives. Besides, the controlled agents may be imperfect, i.e., only
   partially observe their environment, for example due to the limitations
   in their sensors. We propose a framework for controller synthesis based
   on compositional reactive synthesis. We implement the algorithms
   symbolically and apply them to a robot motion planning case study where
   multiple robots are placed on a grid-world with static obstacles and
   other dynamic, uncontrolled and potentially adversarial robots. We
   consider different objectives such as collision avoidance, keeping a
   formation and bounded reachability. We show that by taking advantage of
   the structure of the system, compositional synthesis algorithm can
   significantly outperform centralized synthesis approach, both from time
   and memory perspective, and can solve problems where the centralized
   algorithm is infeasible. Our findings show the potential of symbolic and
   compositional reactive synthesis methods as planning algorithms in the
   presence of dynamically changing and possibly adversarial environment.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{In virtue of the abundant sodium resources, sodium ion batteries (SIBs)
   have been considered to be one of the promising alternatives to lithium
   ion batteries (LIBs). However, current research concentrates mostly on
   sodium ion half-cells, and the development of sodium ion full cells with
   high performance remains a critical challenge. Here we rationally
   designed a full sodium-ion battery based on nanostructured Na2Ti3O7 and
   VOPO4 materials as the anodes and cathodes, owing to their advantageous
   electrochemical features. The full cell outputs one of the highest
   operating voltages close to 2.9 V and delivers a large reversible
   capacity of 114 mA h g(-1) at a rate of 0.1C. It also shows outstanding
   rate capability (similar to 74 mA h g(-1) at 2C rate) and excellent
   cycling stability (92.4\% capacity retention after 100 cycles). A high
   energy density of 220 W h kg(-1) is achieved, which is comparable to the
   state-of-the-art LIBs. Moreover, the temperature-dependent
   charge-discharge tests indicate excellent capacity retentions in a wide
   temperature range of -20 to 55 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{A trifunctional separator fabricated by using a light-weight
   layer-by-layer multi-walled carbon nanotubes/polyethylene glycol
   (MWCNT/PEG) coating has been explored in lithium-sulfur (Li-S)
   batteries. The conductive MWCNT/PEG coating serves as (i) an upper
   current collector for accelerating the electron transport and benefiting
   the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the cell, (ii) a net-like
   filter for blocking and intercepting the migrating polysulfides through
   a synergistic effect including physical and chemical interactions, and
   (iii) a layered barrier for inhibiting the continuous diffusion and
   alleviating the volume change of the trapped active material by
   introducing a ``buffer zone{''} in between the coated layers. The
   multi-layered MWCNT/PEG coating allows the use of the conventional pure
   sulfur cathode with a high sulfur content (78 wt\%) and high sulfur
   loading (up to 6.5 mg cm(-2)) to achieve a high initial discharge
   capacity of 1206 mAh g(-1) at C/5 rate, retaining a superior capacity of
   630 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles. The MWCNT/PEG-coated separator
   optimized by the facile layer-by-layer coating method provides a
   promising and feasible option for advanced Li-S batteries with high

   dual-band plasmon resonance modes in near-infrared and mid-infrared
   regimes with high field enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
   multifunctional applications of AMMP, including surface-enhanced
   infrared spectroscopy, optical capture and patterning of bacteria, and
   photothermal denaturation of proteins. With their multiple functions of
   high performance, in combination with cost-effective fabrication using
   moire nanosphere lithography, the AMMP will enable the development of
   highly integrated biophotonic platforms for a wide range of applications
   in disease theranostics, sterilization, and the study of microbiomes.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting inventory shipments can be useful for lean inventory
   management such as inventory planning. In this paper, we propose
   approaches to predict inventory shipments based on the data extracted
   from the inventory management module of Oracle EBS systems of a
   GPS-manufacturing company. First, we introduce the process to extract
   the inventory shipment data from the Oracle EBS system. Then, we adopt
   time series forecasting algorithms (i.e., ARMA) and Primitive KNN
   algorithms to predict the future shipments for a group of inventory
   items. At last, by discovering the patterns of parameter settings when
   optimal prediction accuracy is achieved, we develop new algorithms to
   reduce runtime at different levels with trade-offs in prediction
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Bipolar forceps are a type of electrosurgical device (ESD) widely used
   for tissue welding in modern surgeries. ESDs have many advantages over
   traditional surgical tools including reduced blood loss, improved
   efficiency and lower surgeon fatigue. However, these devices suffer from
   tissue sticking and damage due to overheating which leads to poor tissue
   joint quality. The problem is potentially caused by uneven power
   distribution due to non-uniform compression applied by the bipolar
   forceps. In this study, the effect of compression force uniformity was
   investigated with an experimental setup to achieve a uniform and
   consistent compression force at the jaws of bipolar forceps. Comparative
   tissue welding experiments were conducted under both uniform and
   non-uniform compression force conditions with tissue mimicking material.
   In situ welding process parameters including compression force,
   electrical voltage, and current were collected and analyzed to
   understand the effect of compression force uniformity. Comparing the
   uniform to non-uniform compression force cases, the results indicate
   that tissue impedance is lower due to increased tissue contact area; the
   electrical power is initially higher during the first few milliseconds,
   but becomes lower for the rest of the welding process recorded. The
   experimental device developed in this study provides an important
   platform to understand the difference of tissue welding process under
   uniform and non-uniform compression force conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A limitation frequently encountered in additive manufacturing (AM)
   models is a lack of indication about their precision and accuracy. Often
   overlooked, information on model uncertainty is required for validation
   of AM models, qualification of AM-produced parts, and uncertainty
   management. This paper presents a discussion on the origin and
   propagation of uncertainty in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) models.
   Four sources of uncertainty are identified: modeling assumptions,
   unknown simulation parameters, numerical approximations, and measurement
   error in calibration data. Techniques to quantify uncertainty in each
   source are presented briefly, along with estimation algorithms to
   diminish prediction uncertainty with the incorporation of online
   measurements. The methods are illustrated with a case study based on a
   transient, stochastic thermal model designed for melt pool width
   predictions. Model uncertainty is quantified for single track
   experiments and the effect of online estimation in overhanging
   structures is studied via simulation. The application of these concepts
   to estimation and control of the L-PBF process is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{ControlIt! is a ROS-based high performance feedback control framework
   that enables WholeBody Control (WBC) algorithms to be implemented,
   instantiated, and integrated into ROS applications. It operates above
   individual joint controllers but below planners and takes a holistic
   view of the robot to achieve multiple simultaneous objectives. Such
   capabilities are particularly useful for highly redundant and
   multi-branched robots like humanoids where the large number of degrees
   of freedom (DOFs) and intrinsic multi-tasking like reaching for an
   object while maintaining balance requires advanced feedback control
   strategies. ControlIt! provides two software abstractions, a compound
   task and a constraint set, that enables users to configure, use, and
   integrate whole body controllers. The compound task consists of
   prioritized tasks with controllers that operate in a relatively low
   dimensional space compared to the number of joints. The constraint set
   specifies physical limits of the robot like points of contact with the
   environment and mechanical couplings between joints. ControlIt! comes
   with an implementation of the Whole Body Operational Space control
   (WBOSC) algorithm, one of the original WBC algorithms. Through
   prioritized null-space projection, WBOSC achieves each tasks' objectives
   subjected to limitations from higher priority tasks and the constraint
   set. Using tasks and constraints, users can make high-DOF multi-branched
   robots execute sophisticated multi-objective and adaptive behaviors.
   This chapter presents ControlIt! and provides examples of advanced whole
   body behaviors it enables.}},

Abstract = {{We report strategies to realize ultra-thin Ru films grown by chemical
   vapor deposition (CVD) on oxide substrates that include incorporating
   amorphizing elements - boron and phosphorus - and introducing light
   molecules - CO and NH3 - that interact reversibly with the Ru surface
   and force additional nucleation events on the oxide substrate.
   First-principles density-functional calculations reveal that Ru(P) and
   Ru(B) alloys with moderate P or B content can result in a glassy
   structure exhibiting strong chemical short-to-medium range order. In the
   low P or B content region amorphous phases are predicted to be
   energetically more favorable than the crystalline counterparts for the
   Ru(P) and Ru(B) alloys above similar to 20 at.\% P and similar to 10
   at.\% B. The relative stability of amorphous and crystalline Ru(B) and
   Ru(P) alloys is examined computationally along with local atomic
   ordering in the amorphous alloys. The growth of ultrathin (3nm)
   amorphous Ru(B) and Ru(P) alloy films of varying B and P concentration
   via chemical vapor deposition using Ru-3(CO)(12) and B2H6 or PH3 as the
   Ru, B and P sources, respectively, is summarized. Electric field stress
   tests to failure are used to evaluate Cu diffusion capabilities for 3nm
   amorphous Ru alloys.
   Chemical approaches are reported that increase island nucleation density
   by suppressing precursor reaction/growth on existing islands using
   inhibitors that can block adsorption of the metal precursor on exposed
   metal surfaces and thereby lead to growth of ultra-thin metal films.
   Film growth studies with Ru-3(CO)(12) and Ru(tBu-Me-amd)(2)(CO)(2)
   precursors and CO and NH3 are reported on thermal oxide substrates.
   Carbon monoxide adsorbs reversibly to Ru surfaces in the temperature
   range of precursor decomposition and Ru film growth (423-673 K). By
   adjusting the CO pressure during nucleation and growth stages,
   nucleation density can be increased by a factor of two and film
   roughness can be reduced by a factor of two. Ammonia adsorbs
   dissociatively on Ru and the surface is nearly saturated with adsorbed
   nitrogen, N-ads, which inhibits growth on nucleated islands. Nucleation
   density increases by nearly a factor of three and film roughness can be
   reduced by a factor of two depending on the partial pressure of NH3
   added during nucleation and growth. Ammonia has the added benefit of
   reducing the crystalline nature of the Ru films.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the effect of distributed generation (DG) on fault
   location estimates when a fault occurs upstream from the DG. It is shown
   that the remote infeed from the DG affects the apparent impedance
   calculated from the substation and thus decreasing the fault location
   accuracy. This paper first evaluates the effects of the DG fault current
   contribution in the calculation of the apparent impedance. In addition
   to the evaluation, a method is proposed to improve the fault location
   estimates with the presence of the DG current infeed. Measurements taken
   at the DG terminal are used in addition to measurements taken at the
   utility substation to improve the fault location estimates. The method
   includes synchronizing both the substation and the DG terminal
   measurements, detecting the relative location of the fault with respect
   to the DG, and estimating load impedance and point of interconnection
   (POI) phasors. The approach is evaluated using simulated fault data
   acquired from time-domain modeling of a distribution system with the DG.
   The location estimates are shown to be accurate with an error of less
   than 2\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a real time decision making framework used to create
   a decision process based on multiple performance maps composed of
   volatile functional values to assist in complex decisions for highly
   nonlinear systems by allowing human visualization and direct algebraic
   computations. The framework, based on map-based process is intended to
   extend other decision tools used in the synthesis process, such as
   neural networks, fuzzy logic and classical control and optimization by
   archiving knowledge learned and data uncertainty in geometric
   representation during the process execution. Time is critical to provide
   reliable and exact response as the systems become more complex. This
   real time decision making framework maintains the structure of previous
   research projects performed by the Robotics Research Group where the
   selected maps are combined into envelopes as functional decision
   surfaces, but including the real-time constraints in the decision
   process. The potential and applicability of this technology is used in
   different knowledge domains, ranging from ground vehicles navigation,
   unmanned aerial vehicles, health care management systems, and
   intelligent actuators.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the rigid body attitude stabilization problem with
   the globally nonsingular quaternion representation. Specifically, a
   passivity-based output feedback controller is considered in the presence
   of measurement errors. In the absence of uncertainties, it is well known
   that the body orientation can be stabilized via dynamic extensions in
   the form of a first-order stable filter from the passivity framework.
   Once the filter is driven by a noise-corrupted quaternion and the
   controller employs both the imperfect attitude measurements and the
   output of the filter, the stability properties of the closed-loop system
   are weakened. Also, the robustness properties cannot be readily
   established through the Lyapunov analysis with a typical Lyapunov-like
   function used for this problem since the time derivative of the function
   is only negative semi-defmite. However, the strictification technique
   allows us to build a partially strict Lyapunov-like function and
   eventually to establish certain conditions that guarantee the
   boundedness of trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate partial derivatives are of the utmost importance for
   optimization and root-solving algorithms, but can prove challenging and
   computationally expensive to obtain. Modem space missions often require
   highly sensitive trajectories, increasing the need for accurate
   partials. Different techniques for computing state-transition matrices
   for trajectory optimization are analyzed, in particular for low-fidelity
   propagations. Analytical methods are compared to the complex step
   derivative approximation and finite differences methods, for a variety
   of problems and integration techniques. The subtle differences between
   variable- and fixed-step integration for partial computation are
   revealed, common pitfalls are observed, and recommendations are made to
   enhance the quality of state transition matrices. A main result is the
   demonstration of small but potentially significant errors in the
   partials when they are computed with variational equations and a
   variable-step integrator.}},

Abstract = {{Slip-form technology, an automatic formwork system, has many benefits in
   construction industries and can shorten the construction time and reduce
   costs. However, slip-form systems have been designed using 2D drawing
   methods, which hinders the utilization of project information and
   impedes essential communication between project participants. The
   application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology,
   especially the parametric modeling method, can be an efficient solution.
   This study presents the beneficial effects of applying BIM technology to
   the design of a slip-form system. First, classification of a tapered
   slip-form was defined, based on Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) in a
   top-down approach. Then, working from the defined classification, 3D
   parametric models of a slip-form were constructed using the script
   language, SmartPart of Allplan (BIM tool). Finally, the established
   parametric model was tested by carrying out two different-height cases
   of tapered concrete pylons, automatically. This parametric design system
   could also be utilized to improve an efficiency of a formwork process.

Abstract = {{Residential buildings in the United States are responsible for the
   consumption of approximately 38\% of electricity, and for much of the
   fluctuations in the power demands on the electric grid, particularly in
   hot climates. Residential Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning
   (HVAC) systems are one of the largest electricity users of homes in
   these regions. ``Smart{''} technologies, including electric
   grid-connected devices and home energy monitoring systems are
   increasingly available and installed in buildings, enabling new,
   data-driven methodologies for the operation of smarter, more sustainable
   building systems. This research investigates the use of residential
   energy use data and smart connected thermostat data to continuously
   monitor the health and performance of residential HVAC systems. Using
   field-collected HVAC energy consumption and performance data to develop
   a process-history based model, the results of this research suggest that
   the use of this methodology can save up to 6\% of annual energy use of
   residential buildings. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Poly(phenylene oxide-co-arylene ether ketone) and poly(phenylene
   oxide-co-arylene ether ketone ketone) copolymers were prepared by
   polycondensation of a dihydroxyfunctional poly(2,6-dimethylphenylene
   oxide) oligomer with 4,40-difluorobenzophenone or
   1,3-bis(4-fluorobenzoyl)benzene and their properties were compared to a
   homopolymer from 2,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)propane
   (tetramethylbisphenol A, TMBPA) and difluorobenzophenone. The polymers
   were cast into films, then crosslinked in the solid state with UV light
   with the wavelength of 365 nm at room temperature to form asymmetrically
   crosslinked thermoset membranes with high gel fractions. This approach
   offers a means for fabricating membrane films, fibers or composites, as
   well as tuning of gas transport properties through crosslinking in the
   solid state. Structural analysis via NMR, IR, and UV-vis spectroscopy
   confirmed the expected copolymer compositions and provided support for a
   free radical crosslinking reaction involving coupling between the
   aromatic ketone and labile benzylic methyl groups. Introduction of the
   ketone group resulted in a decrease in permeabilities, but an increase
   in selectivities for O-2/N-2 and CO2/CH4 gas pairs over unmodified PPO.
   Additionally upon crosslinking a large shift was observed in the gas
   properties of all the membranes, with permeability decreasing and the
   selectivity increasing for the O-2/N-2 and CO2/CH4 gas pairs.}},

Title = {{A LINEAR DEGENERATE ELLIPTIC EQUATION ARISING FROM TWO-PHASE MIXTURES}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{3105-3122}},
Abstract = {{We consider the linear degenerate elliptic system of two first order
   equations u = -a(phi)(del p-g) and del.(b(phi)u) + phi p = phi(1/2)f,
   where a and b satisfy a(0) = b(0) = 0 and are otherwise positive, and
   the porosity phi >= 0 may be zero on a set of positive measure. This
   model equation has a similar degeneracy to that arising in the equations
   describing the mechanical system modeling the dynamics of partially
   melted materials, e. g., in the earth's mantle and in polar ice sheets
   and glaciers. In the context of mixture theory, phi represents the phase
   variable separating the solid one-phase (phi = 0) and fluid-solid
   two-phase (phi > 0) regions. The equations should remain well-posed as
   phi vanishes so that the free boundary between the one-and two-phase
   regions need not be found explicitly. Two main problems arise. First, as
   phi vanishes, one equation is lost. Second, it is shown by stability or
   energy bounds for the solution that the pressure p is not controlled
   outside the support of phi . After an appropriate scaling of the
   pressure and velocity, we obtain a mixed system for which we can show
   existence and uniqueness of a solution over the entire domain,
   regardless of where phi vanishes. The key is to define the appropriate
   Hilbert space containing the velocity, which must have a well defined
   scaled divergence and normal trace. We then develop for the scaled
   problem a mixed finite element method based on lowest order
   Raviart-Thomas elements which is stable and has an optimal convergence
   rate for sufficiently smooth solutions. We show some numerical results
   that verify the optimal rates of convergence for sufficiently regular
   solutions.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{A2779-A2805}},
Abstract = {{The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is the computational
   workhorse for Bayesian inverse problems. However, MCMC struggles in
   high-dimensional parameter spaces, since its iterates must sequentially
   explore the high-dimensional space. This struggle is compounded in
   physical applications when the nonlinear forward model is
   computationally expensive. One approach to accelerate MCMC is to reduce
   the dimension of the state space. Active subspaces are part of an
   emerging set of tools for subspace-based dimension reduction. An active
   subspace in a given inverse problem indicates a separation between a
   low-dimensional subspace that is informed by the data and its orthogonal
   complement that is constrained by the prior. With this information, one
   can run the sequential MCMC on the active variables while sampling
   independently according to the prior on the inactive variables. However,
   this approach to increase efficiency may introduce bias. We provide a
   bound on the Hellinger distance between the true posterior and its
   active subspace exploiting approximation. And we demonstrate the active
   subspace-accelerated MCMC on two computational examples: (i) a
   two-dimensional parameter space with a quadratic forward model and
   one-dimensional active subspace and (ii) a 100-dimensional parameter
   space with a PDE-based forward model and a two-dimensional active
   subspace.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{S78-S100}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a flexible C++ software framework, called GRINS,
   for simulating complex multiphysics systems of partial differential
   equations using the finite element method. GRINS is designed to
   facilitate the rapid development and reuse of finite element formulation
   code as well as other features of complex simulations, including
   quantity-of-interest functionals, solvers, boundary conditions, initial
   conditions, and postprocessing. GRINS is built on the FEMSystem
   framework that is part of the libMesh finite element library. GRINS,
   through FEMSystem and libMesh, supports a number of contemporary
   algorithms and computing features including hybrid distributed and
   shared memory parallelism, parallel adaptive mesh refinement on
   unstructured grids, goal-oriented refinement driven by dual-weighted
   residual error estimates in quantities of interest, and adjoint-based
   parameter sensitivities. GRINS is deployed both as an application
   binary, allowing immediate use of existing features, and as a library to
   which the user may build and link a stand-alone application, extending
   the framework to their needs. Several examples demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the design, including uncertainty quantification
   applications. Planned developments are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Kernel-based methods are a powerful tool in a variety of machine
   learning and computational statistics methods. A key bottleneck in these
   methods is computations involving the kernel matrix, which scales
   quadratically with the problem size. Previously, we introduced ASKIT
   (Approximate Skeletonization Kernel Independent Treecode), an efficient,
   scalable, kernel-independent method for approximately evaluating kernel
   matrix-vector products. ASKIT is based on a novel, randomized method for
   efficiently factoring off-diagonal blocks of the kernel matrix using
   approximate nearest neighbor information. In this context, ASKIT can be
   viewed as an algebraic fast multipole method for arbitrary dimensions.
   In this paper, we introduce our open-source implementation of ASKIT.
   Features of our ASKIT library include linear dependence on the input
   dimension of the data, the ability to approximate kernel functions with
   no prior information on the kernel, and scalability to tens of thousands
   of compute cores and data with billions of points or hundreds of
   dimensions. We also introduce some new extensions and improvements of
   ASKIT, included in our library. We introduce a new method for adaptively
   selecting approximation ranks and correctly partition the nearest
   neighbor information, both of which improve the performance of ASKIT
   over our previous implementation. We describe the ASKIT algorithm in
   detail, and collect and summarize our previous theoretical complexity
   and error bounds in one place. We present a brief selection of
   experimental results illustrating the accuracy and scalability of ASKIT.
   We then provide some details and guidance for users of ASKIT.}},

Abstract = {{The nearest neighbor search problem in general dimensions finds
   application in computational geometry, computational statistics, pattern
   recognition, and machine learning. Although there is a significant body
   of work on theory and algorithms, surprisingly little work has been done
   on algorithms for high-end computing platforms, and no open source
   library exists that can scale efficiently to thousands of cores. In this
   paper, we present algorithms and a library built on top of the message
   passing interface (MPI) and OpenMP that enable nearest neighbor searches
   to hundreds of thousands of cores for arbitrary-dimensional datasets.
   The library supports both exact and approximate nearest neighbor
   searches. The latter is based on iterative, randomized, and greedy
   KD-tree (k-dimensional tree) searches. We describe novel algorithms for
   the construction of the KD-tree, give complexity analysis, and provide
   experimental evidence for the scalability of the method. In our largest
   runs, we were able to perform an all-neighbors query search on a 13 TB
   synthetic dataset of 0.8 billion points in 2,048 dimensions on the 131K
   cores on Oak Ridge's XK6 ``Jaguar{''} system. These results represent
   several orders of magnitude improvement over current state-of-the-art
   methods. Also, we apply our method to nonsynthetic data from machine
   learning data repositories. For example, we perform an
   all-nearest-neighbors search on a variant of the ``MNIST{''} handwritten
   digit dataset with 8 million points in 784 dimensions on 16,384 cores of
   the ``Stampede{''} system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center,
   achieving less than one second per RKDT iteration.}},

   quantization noise, comparator noise and DAC noise are shaped with a
   noise transfer function of (1 - 0.75z(-1)). Unlike conventional
   multi-bit delta-sigma ADCs, both the noise transfer function and the
   error transfer function of DAC mismatches are immune to
   process-voltage-temperature variations. A prototype chip is fabricated
   in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process. At 1.2V and 2MS/s, the chip consumes 61 mu
   W power. SNDR increases by 6dB and the Schreier FoM increases by 3dB
   with OSR doubled. At an OSR of 8, SNDR is 74dB and the Schreier FoM is
   167dB.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{17-27}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents findings from a study conducted to evaluate changes
   in the microstructure of asphalt binder resulting from aging as well as
   the effect of these changes on the evolution of damage resulting from
   tensile deformations. Two types of asphalt binders were aged with the
   rolling thin film oven and pressure aging vessel aging techniques. The
   microstructure and the microrheology of the six binders were obtained
   with atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and creep indentation
   experiments. This information was then used to perform numerical
   simulations to examine the effect of tensile strains on the internal
   stress distribution in the binder. Experimentally, a microloading
   apparatus was used to induce tensile strains in the samples of the
   asphalt binder while the binder was observed for damage with the use of
   AFM. The damage and changes in the binder microstructure resulting from
   the tensile load observed experimentally were compared with the results
   from the numerical simulations. Results suggest that localized regions
   of high stress intensity between different domains act as damage
   nucleation sites. Results also suggest that the differences in the
   rheological properties of the microdomains reduce with aging. As a
   result, the internal distribution of stresses becomes less
   heterogeneous, the magnitude of stress localization decreases, and there
   are fewer sites where damage nucleates.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic user selection is a simple technique that exploits the
   spatial diversity in multiuser relay-aided networks. Nonetheless,
   channel state information (CSI) from all users (and cooperating relays)
   is generally required at a central node in order to make selection
   decisions. Practically, CSI acquisition generates a great deal of
   feedback overhead that could result in significant transmission delays.
   In addition to this, the presence of a full-duplex cooperating relay
   corrupts the fed back CSI by additive noise and the relay's loop (or
   self) interference. This could lead to transmission outages if user
   selection is based on inaccurate feedback information. In this paper, we
   propose an opportunistic full-duplex feedback algorithm that tackles the
   above challenges. We cast the problem of joint user signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) and the relay loop interference estimation at the
   base-station as a block sparse signal recovery problem in compressive
   sensing (CS). Using existing CS block recovery algorithms, the identity
   of the strong users is obtained and their corresponding SNRs are
   estimated. Numerical results show that the proposed technique
   drastically reduces the feedback overhead and achieves a rate close to
   that obtained by techniques that require dedicated error-free feedback
   from all users. Numerical results also show that there is a trade-off
   between the feedback interference and load, and for short coherence
   intervals, full-duplex feedback achieves higher throughput when compared
   to interference-free (half-duplex) feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, data transmission volumes of internet networks have grown
   explosively because most of consumer devices, such as smartphones,
   tablets, wearable devices, etc.., all employ the same media. In the
   future, IoT will be applied to connect various devices related to human
   life. Thus, high data rate networking technology development becomes a
   very important task for Big Data transmission, which includes system
   transmission interface design. In this paper, the semiconductor package
   substrate design for 56 Gb/s high speed networking data transmission
   application is researched. For a design of 56 Gb/s using 30 mm trace
   length with differential signal via and 5+2+5 layers package structure
   on FCBGA, the optimization target for package substrate is 0.3 dB/mm
   differential pair insertion loss at 28 GHz. The optimization design
   rules will be applied on real package product. Comparing with {[}1], our
   design concept has an obvious improvement of about 9dB.}},

Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{1947-1957}},
Abstract = {{This article introduces a new configuration for grid synchronization to
   detect the positive-sequence component of the voltage under unbalanced
   and distorted conditions. The proposed configuration is based on the
   frequency-locked loop technique and combines a self-tuning filter with a
   conventional second-order generalized integrator. The introduced
   structure is able to produce two orthogonal output signals for detecting
   grid voltage information. More importantly, it behaves as a high-order
   filter to completely remove harmonic components and still reserves
   benefits from the previous second-order generalized integrator methods.
   The grid magnitude and frequency are identified accurately and then
   provided to the active power filter for proper operations. Simulation
   and experimental results are presented to verify the concept of the
   introduced method. In addition, the performances of the proposed and
   conventional configurations are compared to recognize the significant
   improvements and effectiveness in the new method.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur is an appealing cathode material for establishing advanced
   lithium batteries as it offers a high theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h
   g(-1) at low material and operating costs. However, the lithium-sulfur
   (Li-S) electrochemical cells face several formidable challenges arising
   from both the materials chemistry (e.g., low electrochemical utilization
   of sulfur and severe polysulfide diffusion) and battery chemistry (e.g.,
   dynamic and static instability and low sulfur loadings). Here, we
   present the design of a core-shell cathode with a pure sulfur core
   shielded within a conductive shell-shaped electrode. The new electrode
   configuration allows Li-S cells to load with a high amount of sulfur
   (sulfur loadings of up to 30 mg cm(-2) and sulfur content approaching 70
   wt\%). The core-shell cathodes demonstrate a superior dynamic and static
   electrochemical stability in Li-S cells. The high-loading cathodes
   exhibit (i) a high sulfur utilization of up to 97\% at C/20-C/2 rates
   and (ii) a low self-discharge during long-term cell storage for a
   three-month rest period and at different cell-storage conditions.
   Finally, a polysulfide-trap cell configuration is designed to evidence
   the eliminations of polysulfide diffusion and to investigate the
   relationship between the electrode configuration and electrochemical
   characteristics. The comprehensive analytical results based on the
   high-loading cathodes suggest that (i) the core-shell cathode is a
   promising solution for designing highly reversible Li-S cells and (ii)
   the polysulfide-trap cell configuration is a viable approach to
   qualitatively evaluating the presence or absence of polysulfide
   diffusion.}},

Pages = {{37-58}},
Abstract = {{Alternative stripping processes have been proposed to reduce energy use
   for CO2 capture, but only a few have been applied to pilot-scale
   experiments. This paper presents the first pilot plant test results of
   one of the most promising stripper configurations, the advanced flash
   stripper with cold and warm rich solvent bypass. The campaign using
   aqueous piperazine was carried out at UT Austin in 2015. The advanced
   flash stripper improves the heat duty by over 25\% compared to previous
   campaigns using the two-stage flash, achieving 2.1 GJ per tonne CO2 of
   heat duty and 32 kJ mol(-1) CO2 of total equivalent work. The bypass
   control strategy proposed minimized the heat duty. The test successfully
   demonstrated the remarkable energy performance and the operability of
   this advanced system. An Aspen Plus (R) model was validated using the
   pilot plant data and used to explore optimum operating and design
   conditions. The irreversibility analysis showed that the pilot plant
   performance has attained 50\% thermodynamic efficiency and further
   energy improvement should focus on the absorber and the cross exchanger
   by increasing absorption rate and solvent capacity.}},

   enriched from 4\% to 18\% by the membrane, and the amine scrubbing
   system will have lower capture costs. Aqueous piperazine ( PZ) is chosen
   as the solvent. Different direct contact cooler ( DCC) options, multiple
   absorber operating conditions, optimal intercooling designs, and
   different cooling options have been evaluated across a wide range of
   inlet CO2. Amine scrubbing without DCC is a superior design for NGCC
   carbon capture. Pump-around cooling at the bottom of the absorber can
   effectively manage the temperature of the hot flue gas, and still be
   effective for CO2 absorption. The absorber gas inlet must be designed to
   avoid excessive localized temperature and solvent evaporation. When the
   inlet CO2 increases from 4\% to 18\%, total absorber CAPEX decreases by
   60\%; another 10\% of the total absorber CAPEX can be saved by
   eliminating the DCC. In-and-out intercooling works well for high CO2,
   while pump-around intercooling is more effective for low CO2. Dry
   cooling requires more packing and energy but appears to be technically
   and economically feasible if cooling water availability is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Companies in the service industry frequently depend on cyclic rosters to
   schedule their workforce. Such rosters offer a high degree of fairness
   and long-term predictability of days on and off, but they can hinder an
   organization's ability to respond to changing demand. Motivated by the
   need for improving cyclic planning at an airport ground handling
   company, this article introduces the idea of flexible cyclic rostering
   as a means of accommodating limited weekly adjustments of employee
   schedules. The problem is first formulated as a multi-stage stochastic
   program; however, this turned out to be computationally intractable. To
   find solutions, two approximations were developed that involved
   reductions to a two-stage problem. In the computational study, the
   flexible and traditional cyclic rosters derived from these
   approximations are compared and metrics associated with the value of
   stochastic information are reported. In the testing, we considered seven
   different perturbations of the demand curve that incorporate the types
   of uncertainty that are common throughout the service industry. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of cyclic rostering
   that applies stochastic optimization. The results show that a reduction
   in undercoverage of more than 10\% on average can be achieved with
   minimal computational effort. It was also observed that the new approach
   can overcome most of the limitations of traditional cyclic rostering
   while still providing most of its advantages.}},

Abstract = {{This tool paper presents comKorat, which unifies constraint-based
   generation of structurally complex tests with combinatorial testing.
   Constraint-based test generation is an effective approach for generating
   structurally complex inputs for systematic testing. While this approach
   can typically generate large numbers of tests, it has limited
   scalability - tests generated are usually only up to a small bound on
   input size. Combinatorial test generation, e.g., pair-wise testing, is a
   more scalable approach but is challenging to apply on commercial
   software systems that require complex input structures that cannot be
   formed by using arbitrary combinations. The comKorat tool integrates
   Korat and ACTS test generators to generate test suites for large scale
   commercial systems. This paper presents a case-study of applying
   comKorat on a software application developed at Yahoo!. The experimental
   results show that comKorat outperforms existing solution in execution
   time and finds a total of 23 previously unknown bugs in the application.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{1377-1381}},
Abstract = {{The bowtie antenna is a topic of growing interest in recent years. In
   this letter, we design, fabricate, and characterize a modified gold
   bowtie antenna integrated on a transparent silica substrate. The bowtie
   antenna is designed with broad RF bandwidth to cover the X-band in the
   electromagnetic spectrum. We numerically investigate the antenna
   characteristics, specifically its resonant frequency and enhancement
   factor. Our designed bowtie antenna provides a strong broadband electric
   field enhancement in its feed gap. Taking advantage of the low-k silica
   substrate, high enhancement factor can be achieved without the unwanted
   reflection and scattering from the backside silicon handle, which is the
   issue of using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. We simulate the
   dependence of resonance frequency on bowtie geometry, and verify the
   simulation results through experimental investigation, by fabricating
   different sets of bowtie antennas on silica substrates and then
   measuring their resonance frequencies. In addition, the far-field
   radiation pattern of the bowtie antenna is measured, and it shows
   dipole-like characteristics with large beamwidth. Such a broadband
   antenna will be useful for a myriad of applications, ranging from
   photonic electromagnetic wave sensing to wireless communications.}},

Abstract = {{In recent studies, we demonstrated that the addition of block copolymers
   to binary donor-acceptor blends represents an effective approach to
   target equilibrium, co-continuous morphologies of interpenetrating
   donors and acceptors. Here, we report a study of the impact of
   all-conjugated
   poly(thieno{[}3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene)-b-polynaphthalene
   diimide (PTB7-b-PNDI) block copolymer additives on the electronic
   properties and photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction organic
   photovoltaic active layers comprised of a PTB7 donor and a
   phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM61) acceptor. We find that
   small amounts of BCP additives lead to improved performance due to a
   large increase in the device open-circuit voltage (V-OC), and the V-OC
   is pinned to this higher value for higher BCP additive loadings. Such
   results contrast prior studies of ternary blend OPVs where either a
   continuous change in V-OC or a value of V-OC pinned to the lowest value
   is observed. We hypothesize and provide evidence in the form of device
   and morphology analyses that the impact of V-OC is likely due to the
   formation of a parallel bulk heterojunction made up of isolated PCBM and
   PNDI acceptor domains separated by intermediate PTB7 donor domains.
   Altogether, this work demonstrates that all-conjugated block copolymers
   can be utilized as additives to both dictate morphology and modulate the
   electronic properties of the active layer.}},

Abstract = {{Epidermal electronics is a class of noninvasive and unobstructive
   skin-mounted, tattoo-like sensors and electronics capable of vital sign
   monitoring and establishing human-machine interface. The high cost of

   associated with its manufacture greatly hinders the widespread use of
   disposable epidermal electronics. Here we report a cost and time
   effective, completely dry, benchtop ``cut-and-paste{''} method for the
   freeform and portable manufacture of multiparametric epidermal sensor
   systems (ESS) within minutes. This versatile method works for all types
   of thin metal and polymeric sheets and is compatible with any tattoo
   adhesives or medical tapes. The resulting ESS are multimaterial and
   multifunctional and have been demonstrated to noninvasively but
   accurately measure electrophysiological signals, skin temperature, skin
   hydration, as well as respiratory rate. In addition, planar stretchable

Abstract = {{The last 10 years have seen the emergence of two-dimensional (2D)
   nanomaterials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
   and black phosphorus (BP) among the growing portfolio of layered van der

   rapidly in device, circuit and system studies that has resulted in
   commercial large-area applications. In this work, we provide a
   perspective of the emerging and potential translational applications of
   2D materials including semiconductors, semimetals, and insulators that
   comprise the basic material set for diverse nanosystems. Applications
   include RF transceivers, smart systems, the so-called internet of
   things, and neurotechnology. We will review the DC and RF electronic
   performance of graphene and BP thin film transistors. 2D materials at
   sub-um channel length have so far enabled cut-off frequencies from
   baseband to 100GHz suitable for low-power RF and sub-THz concepts.}},

   describes the first solution that closes these side channels while

   Because of the details of x86 execution, the evaluation of

   our solution is secure, precise, and fast. Our solution closes more side
   channels than any prior solution. Despite the added security, our

Abstract = {{Film cooling effectiveness can be greatly affected by the
   characteristics of the upstream approach flow, although the degree of
   influence that different approach flow parameters exert is not
   completely clear. While some recent studies have investigated the effect
   of the approach Mach number, very little data exists that describes the
   separate effects of approach Mach and Reynolds number. Furthermore, the
   effect of boundary layer thickness on the effectiveness of shaped holes
   has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, a parametric study
   of these effects was undertaken. This study considered approach flow
   velocities of Ma(infinity) = 0.03 - 0.15, with an independently varied
   Reynolds number of Re-D = 5,500 - 15,500 by utilizing cooling hole
   diameters of D = 4.0 mm and 9.0 mm. The influence of boundary layer
   properties, including laminar and turbulent approach boundary layer
   characteristics, as well as varying boundary layer thickness, was also
   investigated. This work utilized plenum-fed shaped holes of an
   open-literature design. Hi-resolution IR thermography measured adiabatic
   effectiveness downstream of a single row of shaped cooling holes. The
   experiments were conducted at a density ratio of DR = 1.80 with an
   ambient temperature approach flow, using blowing ratios varying from M =
   1.0 to 3.0. Special attention was paid to the implications of these
   results for scaling of effectiveness measurements from lower-speed
   approach flow conditions, as is present in a laboratory, toward higher
   speed conditions present within a gas turbine engine.}},

Pages = {{794-800}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to establish a method to verify in real time
   the quality of a part being built using Selective Laser Sintering (
   SLS).
   Design/methodology/approach - A SLS build of 30 Nylon 12 tensile bars
   was done while using an infrared camera to record the thermal history of
   each bar. The thermal history was then compared to the ultimate tensile
   strength ( UTS) of each bar. In addition, an attempt was made to
   identify where the fracture of each bar occurred based on its thermal
   history.
   Findings - Several analysis techniques were used to compare the thermal
   history of each bar to its UTS. The strongest correlation found was
   0.746. In addition, multiple strategies for predicting the break
   location where used, with the most successful making a correct
   prediction on 46 per cent of the bars.
   Originality/value - This paper studies the feasibility of in-situ build
   verification, a technique that if successful would greatly help the
   further adoption of SLS as a method of manufacturing.}},

   Registration}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1154-1194}},
Abstract = {{We propose regularization schemes for deformable registration and
   efficient algorithms for their numerical approximation. We treat image
   registration as a variational optimal control problem. The deformation
   map is parametrized by its velocity. Tikhonov regularization ensures
   well-posedness. Our scheme augments standard smoothness regularization
   operators based on H-1 - and H-2 -seminorms with a constraint on the
   divergence of the velocity field, which resembles variational
   formulations for Stokes incompressible flows. In our formulation, we
   invert for a stationary velocity field and a mass source map. This
   allows us to explicitly control the compressibility of the deformation
   map and by that the determinant of the deformation gradient. We also
   introduce a new regularization scheme that allows us to control shear.
   We use a globalized, preconditioned, matrix-free, reduced space (
   Gauss-) Newton-krylov scheme for numerical optimization. We exploit
   variable elimination techniques to reduce the number of unknowns of our
   system; we only iterate on the reduced space of the velocity field. Our
   current implementation is limited to the two-dimensional case. The
   numerical experiments demonstrate that we can control the determinant of
   the deformation gradient without compromising registration quality. This
   additional control allows us to avoid oversmoothing of the deformation
   map. We also demonstrate that we can promote or penalize shear while
   controlling the determinant of the deformation gradient.}},

Title = {{FFT, FMM, OR MULTIGRID? A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF STATE-OF-THE-ART POISSON
   SOLVERS FOR UNIFORM AND NONUNIFORM GRIDS IN THE UNIT CUBE}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{From molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry, to plasma physics and
   computational astrophysics, Poisson solvers in the unit cube are used in
   many applications in computational science and engineering. In this
   work, we benchmark and discuss the performance of the scalable methods
   for the Poisson problem which are used widely in practice: the fast
   Fourier transform (FFT), the fast multipole method (FMM), the geometric
   multigrid (GMG), and algebraic multigrid (AMG). Our focus is on solvers
   supporting high-order, highly nonuniform discretizations. To allow
   comparisons with standard libraries we also compare adaptive solvers
   with solvers specialized for problems on regular grids, that is, FFT and
   regular-stencil multigrid, since both are very popular algorithms for
   several practical applications. For the multigrid, we use the finite
   element variant of a high-performance geometric multigrid (HPGMG)
   benchmark. In total we compare five different codes, three of which are
   developed in our group. Our FFT, GMG, and FMM are parallel solvers that
   use high-order approximation schemes for Poisson problems with
   continuous forcing functions (the source or right-hand side). Our FFT
   code is based on the FFTW for single node parallelism. The AMG code is
   from the Trilinos library from the Sandia National Laboratory. Our GMG
   and FMM support octree based mesh refinement and variable coefficients
   and enable highly nonuniform discretizations. The GMG actually also
   supports complex (noncubic) geometries using a forest of octrees. We
   examine and report results for weak scaling, strong scaling, and time to
   solution for uniform and highly refined grids. We present results on the
   Stampede system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and on the Titan
   system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In our largest test case,
   we solved a problem with 600 billion unknowns on 229,379 cores of Titan.
   Overall, all methods scale quite well to these problem sizes. We have
   tested all of the methods with different source functions (the
   right-hand side in the Poisson problem). Our results indicate that FFT
   is the method of choice for smooth source functions that require uniform
   resolution. However, FFT loses its performance advantage when the source
   function has highly localized features like internal sharp layers. FMM
   and GMG considerably outperform FFT for those cases. The distinction
   between FMM and GMG is less pronounced and is sensitive to the quality
   (from a performance point of view) of the underlying implementations.
   The high-order accurate versions of GMG and FMM significantly outperform
   their low-order accurate counterparts.}},
