Abstract = {{Techniques for high-resolution radar imaging through a pipe are
   explored. To improve the angular resolution imposed by the pipe
   diameter, two high-resolution processing methods, MUSIC and compressed
   sensing (CS), are adapted for through-pipe radar imaging. First, the
   signal model, for propagation through the pipe, is formulated such that
   MUSIC and CS can be used. Then, methods for forming radar images from
   scattering collected through a pipe are derived. The methods are then
   demonstrated through electromagnetic simulation and verified with
   measurement data. It is shown that both methods provide high angular
   resolution in comparison with matched filter processing. The primary
   difference between the methods is that MUSIC requires multistatic data
   collection, while monostatic data collection is sufficient for CS. The
   performance of the two methods in terms of the number of targets and the
   signal-to-noise ratio is also evaluated. It is found that both methods
   can be used to image a complex scene composed of multiple point
   scatterers. CS, however, requires fewer number of data points than
   MUSIC. On the other hand, MUSIC is found to be less susceptible to noise
   than CS.}},

Abstract = {{We study limited-coordination scheduling in a wireless downlink network
   with multiple base stations, each serving a collection of users over
   shared channel resources. When neighboring base stations simultaneously
   schedule users on the same channel resource, collisions occur due to
   interference, leading to loss of throughput. Full coordination to avoid
   this problem requires each base station to have complete
   ``instantaneous{''} channel-state information for all its own users, as
   well as the ability to communicate on the same timescale as channel
   fluctuations with neighboring base stations. As such a scheme is
   impractical, if not impossible, to implement, we consider the setting
   where each base station has only limited instantaneous channel-state
   information for its own users, and can communicate with other base
   stations with a significant lag from the channel state variations to
   coordinate scheduling decisions.
   In this setting, we first characterize the throughput capacity of the
   system. A key insight is that sharing delayed queue-length information
   enables coordination on a slow timescale among the base stations, and
   this permits each base station to use limited and local channel-state
   along with global delayed queue-state to stabilize its users' packet
   queues. Based on this, we develop a distributed, queue-aware scheduling
   (and information exchange) algorithm that is provably
   throughput-optimal. Finally, we study the effect of inter-base-station
   coordination delay on the system packet delay performance under the
   throughput-optimal algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an important tool for
   investigating vascular remodeling after injury such as stroke. Although
   techniques such as Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) have emerged as
   valuable tools for imaging CBF in acute experiments, their utility for
   chronic measurements or cross-animal comparisons has been limited.
   Recently, an extension to LSCI called Multi-Exposure Speckle Imaging
   (MESI) was introduced that increases the quantitative accuracy of CBF
   images. In this paper, we show that estimates of chronic blood flow are
   better with MESI than with traditional LSCI. We evaluate the accuracy of
   the MESI flow estimates using red blood cell (RBC) photographic tracking
   as an absolute flow calibration in mice over several days. The flow
   measures computed using the MESI and LSCI techniques were found to be on
   average 10\% and 24\% deviant (n = 9 mice), respectively, compared with
   RBC velocity changes. We also map CBF dynamics after photo-thrombosis of
   selected cortical microvasculature. Correlations of flow dynamics with
   RBC tracking were closer with MESI (r = 0.88) than with LSCI (r = 0.65)
   up to 2 weeks from baseline. With the increased quantitative accuracy,
   MESI can provide a platform for studying the efficacy of stroke
   therapies aimed at flow restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Aortic valve sclerosis (AVSc) is a hallmark of several cardiovascular
   conditions ranging from chronic heart failure and myocardial infarction
   to calcific aortic valve stenosis (AVS). AVSc, present in 2530 of
   patients over 65 years of age, is characterized by thickening of the
   leaflets with marginal effects on the mechanical proprieties of the
   valve making its presentation asymptomatic. Despite its clinical
   prevalence, few studies have investigated the pathogenesis of this
   disease using human AVSc specimens. Here, we investigate in vitro and ex
   vivo BMP4-mediated transdifferentiation of human valve interstitial
   cells (VICs) towards an osteogenic-like phenotype in AVSc.
   Human specimens from 60 patients were collected at the time of aortic
   valve replacement (AVS) or through the heart transplant programme
   (Controls and AVSc). We show that non-calcified leaflets from AVSc
   patients can be induced to express markers of osteogenic
   transdifferentiation and biomineralization through the combinatory
   effect of BMP4 and mechanical stimulation. We show that BMP4 antagonist
   Noggin attenuates VIC activation and biomineralization. Additionally,
   patient-derived VICs were induced to transdifferentiate using either
   cell culture or a Tissue Engineering (TE) Aortic Valve model. We
   determine that while BMP4 alone is not sufficient to induce osteogenic
   transdifferentiation of AVSc-derived cells, the combinatory effect of
   BMP4 and mechanical stretch induces VIC activation towards a phenotype
   typical of late calcified stage of the disease.
   This work demonstrates, for the first time using AVSc specimens, that
   human sclerotic aortic valves can be induced to express marker of
   osteogenic-like phenotype typical of advanced severe aortic stenosis.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the prevalence of
   increased blood pressure during sleep and blunted sleep-time-relative
   blood pressure decline (a nondipper pattern) is very high and increases
   substantially with disease severity. Elevated blood pressure during
   sleep is the major criterion for the diagnoses of hypertension and
   inadequate therapeutic ambulatory blood pressure control in these
   patients. Substantial, clinically meaningful ingestion-time-dependent
   differences in the safety, efficacy, duration of action and/or effects
   on the 24 h blood pressure pattern of six different classes of
   hypertension medications and their combinations have been substantiated.
   For example, bedtime ingestion of angiotensin-converting-enzyme
   inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers is more effective than
   morning ingestion in reducing blood pressure during sleep and converting
   the 24 h blood pressure profile into a dipper pattern. We have
   identified a progressive reduction in blood pressure during sleep-a
   novel therapeutic target best achieved by ingestion of one or more
   hypertension medications at bedtime-as the most significant predictor of
   decreased cardiovascular risk in patients with and without CKD. Recent
   findings suggest that in patients with CKD, ambulatory blood pressure
   monitoring should be used for the diagnosis of hypertension and
   assessment of cardiovascular disease risk, and that therapeutic
   strategies given at bedtime rather than on awakening are preferable for
   the management of hypertension.}},

   the dynamics of laser-induced microbubbles created at different
   locations within the crystalline lenses. An impulsive acoustic radiation
   force was applied to the microbubble, and the microbubble displacements
   were measured using a custom-built high pulse repetition frequency
   ultrasound system. Based on the measured dynamics of the microbubbles,
   Young's moduli of bovine and porcine lens tissue in the vicinity of the
   microbubbles were reconstructed. Age-related changes and
   location-dependent variations in the Young's modulus of the lenses were
   observed. Near the center, the old bovine lenses had a Young's modulus
   approximately fivefold higher than that of young bovine and porcine
   lenses. The gradient of Young's modulus with respect to radial distance

Abstract = {{Microchannel reactors are a promising route for monetizing distributed
   natural gas resources. However, intensification and miniaturization
   represent a significant challenge for reactor control. Focusing on
   autothermal methane-steam reforming reactors, a novel microchannel
   reactor temperature control strategy based on confining a layer of
   phase-change material (PCM) between the reactor plates is introduced.
   Melting-solidification cycles, which occur with latent heat exchange at
   constant temperature, allow the PCM layer to act as an energy storage
   buffera thermal flywheelconstituting a distributed controller that
   mitigates temperature excursions caused by fluctuations in feedstock
   quality. A novel stochastic optimization algorithm for selecting the PCM
   layer thickness (i.e., distributed controller tuning) is introduced.
   Furthermore, a hierarchical control structure, whereby the PCM layer is
   complemented by a supervisory controller that addresses persistent
   disturbances, is proposed. The proposed concepts are illustrated in a
   comprehensive case study using a detailed two-dimensional reactor model.

Abstract = {{To achieve a tight integration of design and analysis, conformal solid
   T-spline construction with the input boundary spline representation
   preserved is desirable. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is
   still an open problem. In this paper, we provide its first solution. The
   input boundary T-spline surface has genus-zero topology and only
   contains eight extraordinary nodes, with an isoparametric line
   connecting each pair. One cube is adopted as the parametric domain for
   the solid T-spline. Starting from the cube with all the nodes on the
   input surface as T-junctions, we adaptively subdivide the domain based
   on the octree structure until each face or edge contains at most one
   face T-junction or one edge T-junction. Next, we insert two boundary
   layers between the input T-spline surface and the boundary of the
   subdivision result. Finally, knot intervals are calculated from the
   T-mesh and the solid T-spline is constructed. The obtained T-spline is
   conformal to the input T-spline surface with exactly the same boundary
   representation and continuity. For the interior region, the continuity
   is C-2 everywhere except for the local region surrounding irregular
   nodes. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of
   the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the impact of through-silicon-via (TSV) and
   shallow trench isolation (STI) stress on the timing variations of 3-D
   IC. We also propose the first systematic TSV-STI-stress-aware timing
   analysis and show how to optimize layouts for better performance. First,
   we generate a stress contour map with an analytical radial stress model
   for TSV. We also develop a stress model for STI from finite element
   analysis results. Then, depending on geometric relation between TSVs,
   STI, and transistors, the tensile and compressive stresses are converted
   to hole and electron mobility variations. Mobility-variation-aware cell
   library and netlist are generated and incorporated into an industrial
   engine for timing analysis of 3-D IC. We observe that TSV stress and STI
   stress interact with each other, and rise and fall time react
   differently to stress and relative locations with respect to both TSVs
   and STIs. Overall, TSV-STI-stress-induced timing variations can be as
   much as +/- 15\% at the cell level. Thus, as an application to layout
   optimization, we exploit the stress-induced mobility enhancement to
   improve performance of 3-D ICs. We show that stress-aware layout
   perturbation could reduce cell delay by up to 23.37\% and critical path
   delay by 6.67\% in our test case.}},

Abstract = {{Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has emerged as the dominant
   failure mechanism for PMOS devices in nanometer integrated circuit (IC)
   designs, thus limiting their lifetime. There are several existing
   research works that mitigate impact of NBTI on gate delay and
   reliability. However, its impact on one of the most important components
   of modern IC design-the clock tree-has not been researched enough. Clock
   gating impacts the extent of NBTI-induced V-TH degradation of clock
   buffers leading to nonuniform NBTI degradation and, thus, increased
   clock skew. In this paper, we propose a practical design-time technique
   of modifying the clock gating implementation by selecting NAND or NOR
   gate as output stage of integrated clock gating cells with the objective
   of minimizing NBTI-induced clock skew. This selection intelligently
   modulates the signal probability and delay equations of clock signal
   paths with no extra hardware penalty. We formulate the skew minimization
   problem as an integer linear program which determines the optimal NAND
   or NOR assignment of clock gating buffer. Experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as the NBTI-induced clock
   skew is reduced by more than 74\% compared to the traditional method.
   The impact of voltage and temperature variation on the proposed
   technique was analyzed and we observed reduced but still significant
   reduction in clock skew under variation as compared to the traditional
   clock gating technique.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) integration with through-silicon vias (TSVs) is
   promising in the integration of many cores into a single chip.
   Network-on-chip (NoC) can efficiently manage the complicated 3D
   interconnections. However, irregular and dense TSV arrays used as
   vertical links in 3D NoC cause severe TSV height variation during
   silicon-thinning and chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) processes. It
   may lead to TSV bonding failure between silicon layers. In this paper,
   we propose the first CMP-aware application-specific 3D NoC design that
   minimizes such TSV height variation and thus reduces the bonding
   failure, and meanwhile optimizes conventional NoC design objectives such
   as hop count, wirelength, power consumption, and area. Our 3D NoC design
   assigns cores to proper silicon layers, determines the 3D NoC topology,
   allocates routing paths, and then floorplans all cores, routers, and TSV
   arrays in a CMP-aware manner. The key idea behind this 3D NoC design
   flow is to determine the CMP-aware 3D NoC topology where TSV arrays with
   low and uniform metal density are inserted between adjacent layers.
   Experimental results show that our CMP-aware 3D NoC design achieves, on
   average, 17.9\% lower TSV height variation, 15\% lower hop count, 2.3\%
   shorter total wirelength, and 7.8\% lower power consumption than the
   previous state-of-the-art 3D NoC designs.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical study of the spinodal decomposition of a binary
   fluid undergoing shear flow using the advective Cahn-Hilliard equation,
   a stiff, nonlinear, parabolic equation characterized by the presence of
   fourth-order spatial derivatives. Our numerical solution procedure is
   based on isogeometric analysis, an approximation technique for which
   basis functions of high-order continuity are employed. These basis
   functions allow us to directly discretize the advective Cahn-Hilliard
   equation without resorting to a mixed formulation. We present steady
   state solutions for rectangular domains in two-dimensions and, for the
   first time, in three-dimensions. We also present steady state solutions
   for the two-dimensional Taylor-Couette cell. To enforce periodic
   boundary conditions in this curved domain, we derive and utilize a new
   periodic Bezier extraction operator. We present an extensive numerical
   study showing the effects of shear rate, surface tension, and the
   geometry of the domain on the phase evolution of the binary fluid.
   Theoretical and experimental results are compared with our simulations.

Abstract = {{Parameter estimation for subsurface flow models is an essential step for
   maximizing the value of numerical simulations for future prediction and
   the development of effective control strategies. We propose the
   iterative stochastic ensemble method (ISEM) as a general method for
   parameter estimation based on stochastic estimation of gradients using
   an ensemble of directional derivatives. ISEM eliminates the need for
   adjoint coding and deals with the numerical simulator as a blackbox. The
   proposed method employs directional derivatives within a Gauss-Newton
   iteration. The update equation in ISEM resembles the update step in
   ensemble Kalman filter, however the inverse of the output covariance
   matrix in ISEM is regularized using standard truncated singular value
   decomposition or Tikhonov regularization. We also investigate the
   performance of a set of shrinkage based covariance estimators within
   ISEM. The proposed method is successfully applied on several nonlinear
   parameter estimation problems for subsurface flow models. The efficiency
   of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the small size of utilized
   ensembles and in terms of error convergence rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We introduce a nonlinear orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) for sparse
   calibration of subsurface flow models. Sparse calibration is a
   challenging problem as the unknowns are both the non-zero components of
   the solution and their associated weights. NOMP is a greedy algorithm
   that discovers a teach iteration the most correlated basis function with
   the residual from a large pool of basis functions. The discovered basis
   (aka support) is augmented across the nonlinear iterations. Once a set
   of basis functions are selected, the solution is obtained by applying
   Tikhonov regularization. The proposed algorithm relies on stochastically
   approximated gradient using an iterative stochastic ensemble method
   (ISEM). In the current study, the search space is parameterized using an
   overcomplete dictionary of basis functions built using the K-SVD
   algorithm. The proposed algorithm is the first ensemble based algorithm
   that tackels the sparse nonlinear parameter estimation problem. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Natural scene statistics have played an increasingly important role in
   both our understanding of the function and evolution of the human vision
   system, and in the development of modern image processing applications.
   Because range (egocentric distance) is arguably the most important thing
   a visual system must compute (from an evolutionary perspective), the
   joint statistics between image information (color and luminance) and
   range information are of particular interest. It seems obvious that
   where there is a depth discontinuity, there must be a higher probability
   of a brightness or color discontinuity too. This is true, but the more
   interesting case is in the other direction-because image information is
   much more easily computed than range information, the key conditional
   probabilities are those of finding a range discontinuity given an image
   discontinuity. Here, the intuition is much weaker; the plethora of
   shadows and textures in the natural environment imply that many image
   discontinuities must exist without corresponding changes in range. In
   this paper, we extend previous work in two ways-we use as our starting
   point a very high quality data set of co-registered color and range
   values collected specifically for this purpose, and we evaluate the
   statistics of perceptually relevant chromatic information in addition to
   luminance, range, and binocular disparity information. The most
   fundamental finding is that the probabilities of finding range changes
   do in fact depend in a useful and systematic way on color and luminance
   changes; larger range changes are associated with larger image changes.
   Second, we are able to parametrically model the prior marginal and
   conditional distributions of luminance, color, range, and (computed)
   binocular disparity. Finally, we provide a proof of principle that this
   information is useful by showing that our distribution models improve
   the performance of a Bayesian stereo algorithm on an independent set of
   input images. To summarize, we show that there is useful information
   about range in very low-level luminance and color information. To a
   system sensitive to this statistical information, it amounts to an
   additional (and only recently appreciated) depth cue, and one that is
   trivial to compute from the image data. We are confident that this
   information is robust, in that we go to great effort and expense to
   collect very high quality raw data. Finally, we demonstrate the
   practical utility of these findings by using them to improve the
   performance of a Bayesian stereo algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{MxSb-Al2O3-C (M=Fe, Ni, and Cu) nanocomposites were synthesized by
   mechanochemical reduction of Sb2O3 with Al and other metals (Fe, Ni, and
   Cu) in the presence of carbon and they were subsequently assessed as
   potential anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Various
   characterization methods, including XRD and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), reveal that the as-prepared nanocomposites consist of
   nanostructured MxSb particles in a matrix of amorphous Al2O3 and
   conductive carbon. The incorporation of Al2O3 and a conductive
   metal-support into the Sb-C composite leads to an improved cycle life.
   The Cu2Sb-Al2O3-C and NiSb-Al2O3-C electrodes show, respectively, 80 and
   90\% capacity retention after 70 cycles at a current rate of 100
   mAg(-1), and the MxSb-Al2O3-C composite anodes display > 70\% retention
   at high current densities of 10 000 mAg(-1). These characteristics are
   attributed to the presence of both a metal framework to support the
   electrochemically active Sb, which results in a low electrode impedance,
   and a ceramic oxide and conductive carbon matrix, which reduce the
   agglomeration of nanoparticles as well as buffer the volume
   expansion/contraction during alloying/dealloying. Ex situ XRD analysis
   of the sodium-storage mechanism in MxSb-Al2O3-C composite anodes
   confirms the formation of a Na3Sb phase during sodiation.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of panel ordered-response structures, the current paper
   compares the performance of the maximum-simulated likelihood (MSL)
   inference approach and the composite marginal likelihood (CML) inference
   approach. The panel structures considered include the pure random
   coefficients (RC) model with no autoregressive error component, as well
   as the more general case of random coefficients combined with an
   autoregressive error component. The ability of the MSL and CML
   approaches to recover the true parameters is examined using simulated
   datasets. The results indicate that the performances of the MSL approach
   (with 150 scrambled and randomized Halton draws) and the simulation-free
   CML approach are of about the same order in all panel structures in
   terms of the absolute percentage bias (APB) of the parameters and
   econometric efficiency. However, the simulation-free CML approach
   exhibits no convergence problems of the type that affect the MSL
   approach. At the same time, the CML approach is about 5-12 times faster
   than the MSL approach for the simple random coefficients panel
   structure, and about 100 times faster than the MSL approach when an
   autoregressive error component is added. As the number of random
   coefficients increases, or if higher order autoregressive error
   structures are considered, one can expect even higher computational
   efficiency factors for the CML over the MSL approach. These results are
   promising for the use of the CML method for the quick, accurate, and
   practical estimation of panel ordered-response models with flexible and
   rich stochastic specifications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The fire industry relies on fire engineers and scientists to develop
   materials and technologies used to either resist, detect, or suppress
   fire. While combustion processes are the drivers for what might be
   considered to be fire phenomena, it is heat transfer physics that
   mediate how fire spreads. Much of the knowledge of fire phenomena has
   been encapsulated and exercised in fire modeling software tools. Over
   the past 30 years, participants in the fire industry have begun to use
   fire modeling tools to aid in decision making associated with design and
   analysis. In the rest of this paper we will discuss what the drivers
   have been for the growth of fire modeling tools; the types of submodels
   incorporated into such tools; the role of model verification,
   validation, and uncertainty propagation in these tools; and possible
   futures for these types of tools to best meet the requirements of the
   user community. Throughout this discussion, we identify how heat
   transfer research has supported and aided the advancement of fire
   modeling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that the cloud computing industry faces many decision
   problems where operations research (OR) could add tremendous value. To
   this end, we provide an OR perspective on cloud computing in three ways.
   First, we compare the cloud computing process with the traditional pull
   supply chain and introduce the cloud IT supply chain as the system of
   moving information from suppliers to consumers through the cloud
   network. Second, based on this analogy, we organize the cloud computing
   decision space by identifying the problems that need to be solved by
   each player in the supply chain-namely, (1) cloud providers, (2) cloud
   consumers, and (3) cloud brokers. We list the OR problems of interest
   from each player's perspective and discuss the tools that may need to be
   developed to solve them. Third, we survey past and current research in
   this space and discuss future research opportunities in cloud computing
   operations research.}},

Abstract = {{The shear stresses derived from blood flow regulate many aspects of
   vascular and immunobiology. In vitro studies on the shear
   stress-mediated mechanobiology of endothelial cells have been carried
   out using systems analogous to the cone-and-plate viscometer in which a
   rotating, low-angle cone applies fluid shear stress to cells grown on an
   underlying, flat culture surface. We recently developed a device that
   could perform high-throughput studies on shear-mediated mechanobiology
   through the rotation of cone-tipped shafts in a standard 96-well culture
   plate. Here, we present a model of the three-dimensional flow within the
   culture wells with a rotating, cone-tipped shaft. Using this model we
   examined the effects of modifying the design parameters of the system to
   allow the device to create a variety of flow profiles. We first examined
   the case of steady-state flow with the shaft rotating at constant
   angular velocity. By varying the angular velocity and distance of the
   cone from the underlying plate we were able to create flow profiles with
   controlled shear stress gradients in the radial direction within the
   plate. These findings indicate that both linear and non-linear spatial
   distributions in shear stress can be created across the bottom of the
   culture plate. In the transition and parallel shaft regions of the
   system, the angular velocities needed to provide high levels of
   physiological shear stress (5Pa) created intermediate Reynolds number
   Taylor-Couette flow. In some cases, this led to the development of a
   flow regime in which stable helical vortices were created within the
   well. We also examined the system under oscillatory and pulsatile motion
   of the shaft and demonstrated minimal time lag between the rotation of
   the cone and the shear stress on the cell culture surface. Biotechnol.

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Two approaches, macroscopic adsorption experiments and molecular
   dynamics simulations, were employed to study the effect of temperature
   on alkaline earth metals adsorption on gibbsite surfaces. Increased
   reaction temperature enhanced the extent of metal ion adsorption for all
   of the alkaline earth metals studied. Whereas Mg2+ and Sr2+ adsorption
   displayed dependence on ionic strength, Sr2+ adsorption exhibited less
   dependence on background ionic strength regardless of temperature. The
   ionic strength dependence was attributed to outer-sphere complexation
   reactions. The ionic strength effect on metal ion removal decreased with
   increasing temperature for both metals. Ba2+ removal by gibbsite, on the
   other hand, was not affected by ionic strength. Results from molecular
   dynamics simulations were in agreement with the findings of the
   experimental study. The amount of thermal energy required to remove
   waters of hydration from the metal cation and the ratio of outer-sphere
   to inner-sphere complexation decreased with increasing ionic radii. It
   was observed from both macroscopic and molecular approaches that the
   tendency to form inner-sphere complexes on gibbsite decreased in the
   order: Be2+ > Sr2+ > Mg2+ and that the common assumption that alkaline
   earth metal ions form outer-sphere complexes appears to be dependent on
   ionic radius and temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   silicon: A first principles study}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{612}},
Pages = {{16-23}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Silicon anodes with excellent capacity retention and rate capability
   have been demonstrated utilizing nanoengineered structures, such as
   nanowires and nanoscale thin films. Here, we present a comparative study
   using density functional theory calculations to examine the surface
   effects on the composition, structural evolution, energetics and Li-ion
   mobility in amorphous LixSi alloys (0.42 <= x <= 3.57). When the Li
   content is sufficiently low, our calculations predict a slight Li
   surface enrichment as the presence of Li atoms contributes to the
   stabilization of the surfaces. As the Li content is further increased,
   the near-surface structure and alloy composition become similar to that
   in the bulk, except for the reduction in Si-Si connectivity within the
   outermost surface layer. The surface effects tend to be very shallow and
   only extend to the first couple of atomic layers; nonetheless, our ab
   initio molecular dynamics simulations highlight the improved Li mobility
   in the near-surface region. Additionally, our calculations show that Li
   mobility is extremely sensitive to the alloy composition, and Li
   diffusivity is enhanced by orders of magnitude in the highly lithiated
   stage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of even a single serum protein molecule on a gold
   nanosphere used in biomedical imaging may increase the size too much for
   renal clearance. In this work, we designed charged similar to 5 nm Au,
   nanospheres coated with binary mixed-charge ligand monolayers that do
   not change in size upon incubation in pure fetal bovine serum (FBS).
   This lack of protein adsorption was unexpected in view of the fact that
   the Au surface was moderately charged. The mixed-charge monolayers were
   composed of anionic citrate ligands modified by place exchange with
   naturally occurring amino acids: either cationic lysine or zwitterionic
   cysteine ligands. The zwitterionic tips of either the lysine or cysteine
   ligands interact weakly with the proteins and furthermore increase the
   distance between the ``buried{''} charges closer to the Au surface and
   the interacting sites on the protein surface. The nm nanospheres were
   assembled into similar to 20 nm diameter nanoclusters with strong
   near-IR absorbance (of interest in biomedical imaging and therapy) with
   a biodegradable polymer, PLA(1k)-b-PEG(10k)-b-PLA(1k). Upon
   biodegradation of the polymer in acidic solution, the nanoclusters
   dissociated into primary similar to 5 nm Au nanospheres, which also did
   not adsorb any detectable serum protein in undiluted FBS.}},

Abstract = {{Germanium (Ge) nanowires can be grown using either gold (Au) or nickel
   (Ni) seeds in a supercritical solvent; however, the quality and yield of
   the nanowires is much higher using Au seeds and diphenyl germane (DPG)
   as a reactant under typical reaction conditions. We find that the
   addition of monophenylsilane (MPS) dramatically improves the yield and
   quality of Ni-seeded Ge nanowires, producing straight nanowires with
   relatively uniform diameter and nearly 100\% conversion of DPG to Ge.
   MPS participates in the phenyl redistribution reaction of DPG and serves
   as a phenyl sink that speeds DPG decomposition and increases the
   conversion to Ge to nearly 100\%. MPS addition to Au-seeded nanowire
   reactions also increases the DPG conversion to Ge to nearly 100\% and
   improves the nanowire quality at higher growth temperature.}},

   patterned in a single lithography/etching process. Simultaneous
   intra-layer coupling to separate silicon photonic layers is demonstrated
   through grating couplers with peak efficiencies of 18\% and 44\% per
   grating coupler for bottom and top layer, respectively, at 1550 nm
   wavelength. The inter-layer grating coupler has an efficiency of 25\% at

Abstract = {{This Account provides perspective on the evolution of the rechargeable
   battery and summarizes Innovations in the development of these devices.
   Initially, I describe the components of a conventional rechargeable
   battery along with the engineering parameters that define the figures of
   merit for a single cell. In 1967, researchers discovered fast Na+
   conduction at 300 K in Na beta,beta `'-alumina. Since then battery
   technology has evolved from a strongly acidic or alkaline aqueous
   electrolyte with protons as the working ion to an organic
   liquid-carbonate electrolyte with Li+ as the working ion in a Li-ion
   battery. The invention of the sodium-sulfur and Zebra batteries
   stimulated consideration of framework structures as crystalline hosts
   for mobile guest alkali ions, and the jump in oil prices in the early
   19705 prompted researchers to consider alternative room-temperature
   batteries with aprotic liquid electrolytes. With the existence of Li
   primary cells and ongoing research on the chemistry of reversible Li
   Intercalation into layered chalcogenides, industry invested in the
   production of a Li/TiS2 rechargeable cell. However, on repeated
   recharge, dendrites grew across the electrolyte from the anode to the
   cathode, leading to dangerous short-circuits in the cell in the presence
   of the flammable organic liquid electrolyte. Because lowering the
   voltage of the anode would prevent cells with layered-chalcogenide
   cathodes from competing with cells that had an aqueous electrolyte,
   researchers quickly abandoned this effort. However, once it was realized
   that an oxide cathode could offer a larger voltage versus lithium,
   researchers considered the extraction of Li from the layered LiMO2
   oxides with M = Co or Ni.
   These oxide cathodes were fabricated in a discharged state, and battery
   manufacturers could not conceive of assembling a cell with a discharged
   cathode. Meanwhile, exploration of Li intercalation into graphite showed
   that reversible Li insertion into carbon occurred without dendrite
   formation. The SONY corporation used the LiCoO2/carbon battery to power
   their initial cellular telephone and launched the wireless revolution.
   As researchers developed 3D transition-metal hosts, manufacturers
   introduced spinel and olivine hosts in the Li-x{[}Mn-2]O-4 and LiFe(PO4)
   cathodes. However, current Li-ion batteries fall short of the desired
   specifications for electric-powered automobiles and the storage of
   electrical energy generated by wind and solar power. These demands are
   stimulating new strategies for electrochemical cells that can safely and
   affordably meet those challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical energy storage is one of the most critical needs of 21st
   century society. Applications that depend on electrical energy storage
   include portable electronics, electric vehicles, and devices for
   renewable energy storage from solar and wind. Lithium-ion (Li-ion)
   batteries have the highest energy density among the rechargeable battery
   chemistries. As a result, Li-ion batteries have proven successful in the
   portable electronics market and will play a significant role in
   large-scale energy storage. Over the past two decades, Li-ion batteries
   based on insertion cathodes have reached a cathode capacity of similar
   to 250 mA h g(-1) and an energy density of similar to 800 W h kg(-1),
   which do not meet the requirement of similar to 500 km between charges
   for all-electric vehicles. With a goal of increasing energy density,
   researchers are pursuing alternative cathode materials such as sulfur
   and O-2 that can offer capacities that exceed those of conventional
   insertion cathodes, such as LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4, by an order of magnitude
   (>1500 mA h g(-1)). Sulfur, one of the most abundant elements on earth,
   is an electrochemically active material that can accept up to two
   electrons per atom at similar to 2.1 V vs Li/Li+. As a result, sulfur
   cathode materials have a high theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g(-1),
   and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have a theoretical energy density of
   similar to 2600 W h kg(-1). Unlike conventional insertion cathode
   materials, sulfur undergoes a series of compositional and structural
   changes during cycling, which involve soluble polysulfides and insoluble
   sulfides. As a result, researchers have struggled with the maintenance
   of a stable electrode structure, full utilization of the active
   material, and sufficient cycle life with good system efficiency.
   Although researchers have made significant progress on rechargeable Li-S
   batteries in the last decade, these cycle life and efficiency problems
   prevent their use in commercial cells.
   To overcome these persistent problems, researchers will need new sulfur
   composite cathodes with favorable properties and performance and new
   Li-S cell configurations. In this Account, we first focus on the
   development of novel composite cathode materials including sulfur carbon
   and sulfur polymer composites, describing the design principles,
   structure and properties, and electrochemical performances of these new
   materials. We then cover new cell configurations with carbon interlayers
   and Li/dissolved polysulfide cells, emphasizing the potential of these
   approaches to advance capacity retention and system efficiency. Finally,
   we provide a brief survey of efficient electrolytes. The Account
   summarizes improvements that could bring Li-S technology closer to mass
   commercialization.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the lithiation behavior of silicon-graphene (Si-Gr)
   composites using density functional theory calculations. Our
   calculations demonstrate charge transfer from Li to both Si and C (in
   graphene); the excess electrons on graphene create an electric field,
   which attracts Li cations while repelling Si anions and thus results in
   a distinct alternative Li-Si layering structure near graphene The
   interfacial Li ions exhibit substantially higher mobility along the
   Si/Gr interface in comparison to bulk diffusion in Si; such facile
   interfacial diffusion could contribute toward high performance anodes
   with fast charge/discharge rates. However, the presence of graphene
   tends to have no significant impact on the structural evolution of Si
   during lithiation, as Li atoms are mostly incorporated in the Si matrix
   rather than at the Si/Gr interface. Consequently, the theoretical
   capacity and voltage profile of the Si-Gr composite are predicted to be
   close to those of pure Si.}},

   stability and to achieve low adsorption on silica in high salinity brine
   composed of 8\% wt. NaCl + 2\% wt. CaCl2. Furthermore, the degree of
   adsorption of the nanoparticles on silica was controlled by modifying
   the acrylic acid groups in the copolymers with a series of diamines and
   triamines to add hydrophobicity. The adsorption on colloidal silica
   microparticles ranged from <1 mg/m(2) for highly charged hydrophilic
   surfaces on the iron oxide nanoparticles to 22 mg/m(2) for the most
   hydrophobic amine-modified surfaces, corresponding to monolayer
   coverages that ranged from 0.2\% to 11.5\%, respectively. The specific
   adsorption (mg-IO/m(2)-silica), monolayer coverage, and parameters for
   Langmuir isotherms were evaluated for various 10 nanoclusters as a
   function of the properties of the copolymers on their surfaces. (C) 2013

   structure-preserving quantities and numerical simulations that are

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate label-free photonic crystal (PC)
   microcavity biosensors in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) to detect the
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor, ZEB1, in
   minute volumes of sample. Multiplexed specific detection of ZEB1 in
   lysates from NCI-H358 lung cancer cells down to an estimated
   concentration of 2 cells per micro-liter is demonstrated. L13 photonic
   crystal microcavities, coupled to W1 photonic crystal waveguides, are
   employed in which resonances show high Q in the bio-ambient phosphate
   buffered saline (PBS). When the sensor surface is derivatized with a
   specific antibody, the binding of the corresponding antigen from a
   complex whole-cell lysate generates a change in refractive index in the
   vicinity of the photonic crystal microcavity, leading to a change in the
   resonance wavelength of the resonance modes of the photonic crystal
   microcavity. The shift in the resonance wavelength reveals the presence
   of the antigen. The sensor cavity has a surface area of similar to 11 mu
   m(2). Multiplexed sensors permit simultaneous detection of many binding
   interactions with specific immobilized antibodies from the same
   bio-sample at the same instant of time. Specificity was demonstrated
   using a sandwich assay which further amplifies the detection sensitivity
   at low concentrations. The device represents a proof-of-concept
   demonstration of label-free, high throughput, multiplexed detection of
   cancer cells with specificity and sensitivity on a silicon chip
   platform. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A layered sulfide, Na0.5NbS2 (space group: P6(3)/mmc), was synthesized
   by a conventional solid-state reaction as an electrode material for a
   Na-ion battery. Galvanostatic Na insertion/extraction was performed to
   characterize the system NaxNbS2 (0 <= x <= 1.0) operating on the
   Nb(IV)/Nb(III) redox couple. Although the system shows a high specific
   capacity of 143.6 mAh g(-1), the voltage profile is not suitable with a
   signature of Na/vacancy ordering at x = 0.5. First-principles
   calculation was applied to reveal possible structures of NaxNbS2 and
   describe the corresponding electrochemical properties. The calculated Na
   binding energies and voltages are in good agreement with experimental
   charge/discharge voltages. We also found a possible atomic arrangement
   of Na/vacancy ordering in Na0.5NbS2. Although layered NaMS2 systems
   allow full sodium intercalation, the strong Na+-Na+ intralayer
   interaction induces layer gliding and Na+-ion ordering that create
   undesirable steps in the voltage profile.}},

Abstract = {{All three polymorphs of LiVOPO4 have been synthesized, for the first
   time, by a microwave-assisted solvothermal (MW-ST) method by adjusting
   the reaction media and conditions. The triclinic polymorph
   (alpha-LiVOPO4) was obtained as the most stable and stoichiometric
   product and was thus chosen for optimization. Varying solvent mixtures
   consisting of water and alcohols/glycols proved to have significant
   effects on the particle size/morphology, with the water and glycol
   mixtures generally producing smaller particles. Particle size was also
   reduced with decreasing reaction time, decreasing reactant
   concentration, and CTAB surfactant addition. The electrochemical
   performance was analyzed in two potential ranges: 3.0-4.5 V
   corresponding to the insertion/extraction of one lithium and 2.0-4.5 V
   corresponding to the insertion/extraction of two lithium into/from the
   LiVOPO4 structure. Synthesis in a mixture of water and ethylene glycol
   in particular led to a high capacity of 134 mAh/g during the first cycle
   in the 3.0-4.5 V region. Initial attempts at coating the particles with
   PEDOT:PSS improved the cycling performance.}},

Abstract = {{Ruthenium was deposited on SiO2/Si(001) substrates at 473 K by chemical
   vapor deposition (CVD) using triruthenium dodecacarbonyl with and
   without an overpressure of CO. Carbon monoxide was employed to inhibit
   the growth of previously nucleated islands to allow the formation of
   additional nuclei. Carbon monoxide also competed with the precursor for
   free hydroxyl sites on SiO2 sites where precursor adsorption and
   decomposition is favored. Total pressure was maintained at 84 mTorr, and
   CO was introduced at partial pressures of 2.5 and 8.4 mTorr at various
   intervals during 15 min growth runs. The nucleation density decreases
   with increasing CO overpressure when CO and precursor are injected
   simultaneously from the beginning; in this case, CO blocks the free
   hydroxyls where the Ru precursor dissociates. When 8.4 mTorr CO is
   introduced for 5 min to the CVD chamber after a 10 min period of
   deposition without CO, the maximum nucleation density was achieved (16.4
   x 10(11)/cm(2)), which is twice as much as the Ru particle density found
   for 15 min deposition without added CO. After 10 min of growth, hydroxyl
   groups have mostly reacted and the injected CO adsorbs on Ru
   nanoparticles, inhibiting growth and forcing additional Ru nucleation on
   the SiO2 substrate. Growth was extended to 2 h to explore the influence
   of CO on ultrathin Ru film characteristics. The film grown without CO
   for 10 min and then with 8.4 mTorr CO for 1 h 50 min was thinner and
   smoother than the film grown without CO for 2 h because CO adsorption on
   the Ru surface slows the Ru islands/film growth rate.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we present work on epitaxial Ge films grown on a thin buffer layer
   of C doped Ge (Ge:C). The growth rate of Ge:C is found to slow over time
   and is thus unsuitable for thick (>20 nm) layers. We demonstrate Ge
   films from 10 nm to >150 nm are possible by growing pure Ge on a thin
   Ge:C buffer. It is shown that this stack yields exceedingly low
   roughness levels (comparable to bulk Si wafers) and contains fewer
   defects and higher Hall mobility compared to traditional heteroepitaxial
   Ge. The addition of C at the interface helps reduce strain by its
   smaller atomic radius and its ability to pin defects within the thin
   buffer layer that do not thread to the top Ge layer. (C) 2013 AIP

   synthesized through the grafting of graphene oxide (GO) with

   vanadate}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{We present theoretical evidence for the phase dependence of hole
   localization and transport in bismuth vanadate (BiVO4). Our hybrid
   density-functional theory calculations predict that, in the tetragonal
   phase {[}tetragonal scheelite BiVO4 (ts-BiVO4)], an excess hole tends to
   localize around a BiO8 polyhedron with strong lattice distortion,
   whereas, in the monoclinic phase {[}monoclinic scheelite BiVO4
   (ms-BiVO4)], it spreads over many lattice sites. The phase-dependent
   behavior is likely related to the higher structural stability of
   ms-BiVO4 than ts-BiVO4, which may suppress hole-induced lattice
   distortions. Our study also demonstrates that the relatively weakly
   localized hole in ms-BiVO4 undergoes faster diffusion compared to the
   case of ts-BiVO4, irrespective of the fact that the degrees of
   localization and mobility vary depending on the choice of
   exchange-correlation functional. The mobility difference may provide an
   explanation for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of ms-BiVO4 over
   ts-BiVO4 for water oxidation, considering that the increased mobility
   would lead to an increase in the hole current to the catalyst surface.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2796-2807}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Microporous polymer membranes were produced from beta nucleated
   isotactic polypropylene using a solvent-free process involving extrusion
   and biaxial stretching. Pore formation, previously shown to depend upon
   the quantity of perfected beta crystalline material in the film, was
   found to also depend upon stretching temperature. The pore structure of
   membranes produced under a variety of processing conditions was
   investigated by SEM, flow porometry, and gas permeation techniques. The
   mechanism of gas transport through the membrane was determined using
   permeability experiments and the film pore size distribution. Gas
   permeability was correlated with film porosity and compared to the
   permeability of an array of porous polypropylene films. High quality
   microporous membranes were produced without the use of the strict
   process control required for traditional extruded films, and such
   membranes exhibit performance comparable to commercially available
   Celgard films. This process flexibility provides an avenue toward
   coextruded composite membranes for a range of high-value applications.

   temperature of the copolymers was up to 43 degrees C higher than neat

Abstract = {{Background-This study examined the impact of different ablation
   strategies on atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence and quality of life in
   coexistent AF and atrial flutter (AFL).
   Methods and Results-Three-hundred sixty enrolled patients with
   documented AF and AFL were blinded and randomized to group 1, AF +/- AFL
   ablation (n=182), or group 2, AFL ablation only (n=178). AF recurrence
   was evaluated with event recording and 7-day Holter at 3, 6, 9, and
   12-month follow-ups. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and at the
   12-month follow-up with 4 questionnaires: the Medical Outcome Study
   Short Form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score, the Beck
   Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Of the 182
   patients in group 1, 58 (age, 63 +/- 8 years; 78\% male; left
   ventricular ejection fraction, 59 +/- 8\%) had AF+AFL ablation and 124
   (age, 61 +/- 11 years; 72\% male; left ventricular ejection fraction, 59
   +/- 7\%) had AF ablation only. In group 2 (age, 62 +/- 9 years; 76\%
   male; left ventricular ejection fraction, 58 +/- 10\%), only AFL was
   ablated by achieving bidirectional isthmus conduction block. Baseline
   characteristics were not different across groups. At 21 +/- 9 months of
   follow-up, 117 in group 1 (64\%) and 34 in group 2 (19\%) were
   arrhythmia free (P<0.001). In group 1, scores on most quality-of-life
   subscales showed significant improvement at follow-up, whereas group 2
   patients derived relatively minor benefit.
   Conclusions-In coexistent AF and AFL, lower recurrence rate and better
   quality of life are associated with AF ablation only or AF+AFL ablation
   than with lone AFL ablation. Furthermore, quality of life directly
   correlates with freedom from arrhythmia, as shown in this study for the
   first time in patients blinded to the procedure.

Abstract = {{Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the water
   and methanol diffusivities in acid-base polymer blend membranes
   consisting of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and
   polysulfone tethered with different bases (2-amino-benzimidazole,
   S-amino-benzotriazole, and 1H-perimidine). Consistent with experimental
   trends, methanol and water diffusivities in all the SPEEK-based systems
   were found to be lower than those in Nafion. When the base group
   attached to the polysulfone was varied, the methanol diffusivities were
   found to exhibit the same trends as observed in the experimentally
   measured crossover current densities. Such trends were however observed
   only when we explicitly accounted for hydrogen bonding interactions
   between the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen of the base and the oxygen
   of the sulfonate of SPEEK. Furthermore, in almost all cases, methanol
   diffusivities were found to be highly correlated with the pore sizes of
   the membranes, which, in the case of blends, were found to be influenced
   by the strength of parasitic hydrogen bonding interactions between the
   sulfone oxygen of polysulfone and H(N-base). The influence of pore sizes
   on the methanol diffusivity behavior was rationalized by using both the
   coordination behavior and the residence time distributions of methanol
   in various regions of pores. Together, our results unravel the
   physicochemical origins of methanol diffusivities in acid-base blend
   membranes and highlight the crucial role played by the hydrogen bonding
   interactions in influencing methanol transport in acid-base polymer
   blend membranes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research on Software Architecture has recovered its original
   emphasis on keeping track of design decisions and their rationales
   during software development, compiling them under the name of
   architectural knowledge (AK). This knowledge is composed of decision
   assets, which relate to each other creating a decision network
   structure. We argue that relationships in these networks of AK contain
   valuable information, in particular when they describe negative
   semantics. We use antipatterns to exploit and manage these negative
   relationships system-atically. After examining and classifying the kinds
   of AK relationships, we describe a method that enriches this network by
   means of antipattern structures. To show the feasibility and suitability
   of this approach, we provide a proof-of-concept by applying it to an
   existing process, ATRIUM, with a concrete example, the Gas Station
   metaphor. Results of the use of the presented approach into three di r
   erent projects with di r erent complexities show both its feasibility
   and applicability.}},

Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This study is focused on simulation of thunderstorm downbursts and
   associated wind turbine loads. We first present a thunderstorm downburst
   model, in which the wind field is assumed to result from the summation
   of an analytical mean field and stochastic turbulence. The structure and
   evolution of the downburst wind field based on the analytical model are
   discussed. Loads are generated using stochastic simulation of the
   aeroelastic response for a model of a utility-scale 5-MW turbine. With
   the help of a few assumptions, particularly regarding control
   strategies, we address the chief influences of wind velocity fields
   associated with downbursts-namely, large wind speeds and large, rapid
   wind direction changes-by considering different storm scenarios and
   studying associated turbine loads. These scenarios include, first, an
   illustrative case to understand details related to the turbine response
   simulation; this is followed by a study involving a different storm
   touchdown location relative to the turbine as well as a critical case
   where a shutdown sequence is included. Results show that the
   availability of and assumptions in wind turbine control systems during a
   downburst clearly influence overall system response. Control system
   choices can significantly mitigate turbine loads during downbursts.
   Results also show that different storm touchdown locations result in
   distinct characteristics in inflow wind fields and, hence, in
   contrasting turbine response.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The ability to image metallic implants is important for medical
   applications ranging from diagnosis to therapy. Photoacoustic (PA)
   imaging has been recently pursued as a means to localize metallic
   implants in soft tissue. The work presented herein investigates
   different mechanisms to modulate the PA signal generated by macroscopic
   metallic surfaces. Wires of five different metals are tested to simulate
   medical implants/tools, while surface roughness is altered or physical
   vapor deposition (PVD) coatings are added to change the wires' overall
   optical absorption. PA imaging data of the wires are acquired at 970 nm.
   Results indicate that PA signal generation predominately occurs in a
   wire's metallic surface and not its aqueous surroundings. PA signal
   generation is similar for all metals tested, while addition of PVD
   coatings offers significant modulations (i.e., 4-dB enhancement and
   26-dB reduction achieved) in PA signal generation. Results also suggest
   that PA signal increases with increasing surface roughness. Different
   coating and roughness schemes are then successfully utilized to generate
   spatial PA signal patterns. This work demonstrates the potential of
   surface modifications to enhance or reduce PA signal generation to
   permit improved PA imaging of implants/tools (i.e., providing
   location/orientation information) or to allow PA imaging of surrounding
   tissue. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{A swept-source dual-wavelength photothermal (DWP) optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) system is demonstrated for quantitative imaging of
   microvasculature oxygen saturation. DWP-OCT is capable of recording
   three-dimensional images of tissue and depth-resolved phase variation in
   response to photothermal excitation. A 1,064-nm OCT probe and 770-nm and
   800-nm photothermal excitation beams are combined in a single-mode
   optical fiber to measure microvasculature hemoglobin oxygen saturation
   (SO2) levels in phantom blood vessels with a range of blood flow speeds
   (0 to 17 mm/s). A 50-mu m-diameter blood vessel phantom is imaged, and
   SO2 levels are measured using DWP-OCT and compared with values provided
   by a commercial oximeter at various blood oxygen concentrations. The
   influences of blood flow speed and mechanisms of SNR phase degradation
   on the accuracy of SO2 measurement are identified and investigated. (C)

Abstract = {{In the presence of nonlinearity, we analyze the impact of the selected
   mapping (SLM) technique on bit-error-rate (BER) performance of
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in an additive
   white Gaussian noise channel. The peak-to-average-ratio (PAR) reduction
   gain of SLM can be increased by improving the PAR statistics at the cost
   of complexity in the OFDM transmitter, thereby helping to decrease the
   required power amplifier (PA) output backoff (OBO). However, since the
   PAR statistics focus only on the statistical distribution of the highest
   peak in an OFDM symbol, the statistics cannot be used to quantify BER
   performance degradation in the presence of nonlinearity such as that
   caused by a PA or digital-to-analog converter (DAC). We first derive a
   closed-form expression for the envelope power distribution in an OFDM
   system with SLM. Then, using this derived envelope power distribution,
   we investigate the BER performance and the total degradation (TD) of
   OFDM systems with SLM under the existence of nonlinearity. We discuss
   peak backoff (PBO) and the clipping ratio, which determine the operating
   point of the PA and dynamic range of the DAC, respectively. Lastly, we
   consider the total degradation (TD), which indicates the tradeoff
   between the OBO and the Eb/No penalty due to nonlinearity, and
   numerically compute the PBO and clipping ratio that minimize the TD. The
   TD-minimizing PBO and clipping ratio are given as functions of the
   number of candidate signals in SLM.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports a novel multispectral image processing technique
   for rapid, noninvasive quantification of biomass concentration in

   concentration is critical for efficient production of biofuel
   feedstocks, food supplements, and bioactive chemicals. Particularly,
   noninvasive and rapid detection techniques can significantly aid in
   providing delay-free process control feedback in large-scale cultivation
   platforms. In this technique, three-band spectral images of Anabaena
   variabilis cultures were acquired and separated into their red, green,
   and blue components. A correlation between the magnitude of the green
   component and the areal biomass concentration was generated. The
   correlation predicted the biomass concentrations of independently
   prepared attached and suspended cultures with errors of 7 and 15\%,
   respectively, and the effect of varying lighting conditions and
   background color were investigated. This method can provide necessary
   feedback for dilution and harvesting strategies to maximize
   photosynthetic conversion efficiency in large-scale operation. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an experimental study on the precipitation of
   magnesium carbonates (Mg-carbonates) from a solution containing
   magnesium chloride and sodium carbonate and in the presence of
   supercritical carbon dioxide. We performed homogeneous (unseeded) batch
   precipitation experiments at 100 bar of CO2 and at 90 degrees C, 120
   degrees C, and 150 degrees C. The system was monitored with online
   temperature and pressure sensors and an online Raman spectroscopy probe.
   We investigated the effect of temperature and solution composition,
   i.e., supersaturation ratio, pH, speciation, ionic strength, and water
   activity on the mechanism and the kinetics of the precipitation of
   Mg-carbonates. Raman spectroscopy measurements allowed us to follow the
   temporal evolution of the solution and suspension composition and showed
   two Mg-carbonates can form under the investigated conditions, i.e.,
   magnesite and hydromagnesite. The precipitation of these two phases
   occurred between pH 5.5 and 6.5 and was influenced by temperature,
   supersaturation ratio with respect to magnesite (S-M) and hydromagnesite
   (S-H), and the initial concentration of magnesium.
   At all investigated temperatures, we observed direct precipitation of
   magnesite while at 120 degrees C and 150 degrees C also simultaneous
   precipitation of magnesite and hydromagnesite followed by the
   transformation of the latter into the former. Under highly
   supersaturated conditions with respect to magnesite, S-M as large as 20,
   magnesite nucleated rapidly when the system was also supersaturated with
   respect to hydromagnesite, S-H as large as 1.5; whereas no nuclei formed
   within 20 h, otherwise. The analysis of the data collected at 120
   degrees C and at 150 degrees C highlighted that the change in the type
   of mechanism was associated with the initial supersaturation ratios and
   the initial concentration of magnesium in solution. At 120 degrees C,
   the transformation process lasted for 2 h, slowing down the formation of
   magnesite, despite of the large S-M; whereas at 150 degrees C, the
   transformation process was only 5 min long, without affecting magnesite
   precipitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modified embedded atom method-molecular dynamics simulations have been
   performed to define the various growth facets at the interfaces of Au
   catalyzed-silicon nanowires (SiNWs). The interfacial growth facet of
   Au/SiNW on c-Si (111) surface has a single, planar interface, that grows
   parallel to the Si (111) planes. The interfacial growth facet on c-Si
   (211) surface has an asymmetrical, cone shape. The interface of Au/SiNW
   consists of two planes-the greater being \{111\} and the lesser being
   \{100\} planes. And finally the interfacial growth facet on c-Si (110)
   surface has a symmetrical, cone shape. The interface consists of two
   \{111\} planes. These findings exhibit good agreement with the previous
   experimental observation done with cross-sectional high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy. We also predict the interfacial growth
   facet of Au/SiNW with NW direction < 100 >, explaining that such a
   direction rarely exists due to geometrical limitations. We propose that
   changes in SiNW direction are caused the existence of various growth
   facets at the Au/SiNW interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that the magnetic component of light has a
   minor role in the light-matter interaction. The recent discovery of
   metamaterials has broken this traditional understanding, as both the
   electric and the magnetic field are key ingredients in metamaterials.
   The top-down technology used so far employs noble metals with large
   intrinsic losses. Here we report on a bottom-up approach for processing
   metamaterials based on suspensions of monodisperse full dielectric
   silicon nanocavities with a large magnetic response in the near-infrared
   region. Experimental results and theory show that silicon-colloid-based
   liquid suspensions and photonic crystals made of two-dimensional arrays
   of particles have strong magnetic response in the near-infrared region
   with small optical losses. Our findings might have important
   implications in the bottom-up processing of large-area low-loss
   metamaterials working in the near-infrared region.}},

Abstract = {{Planar supercapacitors have recently attracted much attention owing to
   their unique and advantageous design for 2D nanomaterials based energy
   storage devices. However, improving the electrochemical performance of
   planar supercapacitors still remains a great challenge. Here we report
   for the first time a novel, high-performance in-plane supercapacitor
   based on hybrid nanostructures of quasi-2D ultrathin MnO2/graphene
   nanosheets. Specifically, the planar structures based on the (delta-MnO2
   nanosheets integrated on graphene sheets not only introduce more
   electrochemically active surfaces for absorption/desorption of
   electrolyte ions, but also bring additional interfaces at the hybridized
   interlayer areas to facilitate charge transport during
   charging/discharging processes. The unique structural design for planar
   supercapacitors enables great performance enhancements compared to
   graphene-only devices, exhibiting high specific capacitances of 267 F/g
   at current density of 0.2 A/g and 208 F/g at 10 A/g and excellent rate
   capability and cycling stability with capacitance retention of 92\%
   after 7000 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, the high planar
   malleability of planar supercapacitors makes possible superior
   flexibility and robust cyclability, yielding capacitance retention over
   90\% after 1000 times of folding/unfolding. Ultrathin 2D nanomaterials
   represent a promising material platform to realize highly flexible
   planar energy storage devices as the power back-ups for
   stretchable/flexible electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{The design and evaluation of Inter-cell Interference Coordination (ICIC)
   techniques has been the focus of significant research as wireless
   networks are increasingly faced with the challenge of balancing fairness
   to users at the cell-edge with high spectral efficiency. This work
   considers the use of Fractional frequency reuse (FFR), in the cellular
   uplink, which is well-suited for modern cellular networks due to its low
   complexity and coordination requirements and resource allocation
   flexibility. These approaches have typically been modeled using
   deterministic grids for the base station deployments and analyzed
   through system-level simulations, which do not lead to fundamental
   insights or tractable expressions of relevant metrics of coverage
   probability or average rate for a typical user. Instead, this work
   utilizes Poisson point processes for the underlying spatial models for
   user and base station locations. From the derived expressions we
   quantify the coverage gains with Strict FFR relative to universal reuse
   and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR), as well as the performance tradeoff SFR
   achieves for edge and inner users through greater bandwidth efficiency.
   We additionally illustrate how the analytical model can be directly
   related to traffic or coverage requirements and gives insight into
   selecting power control parameters and resource allocations under Strict
   FFR and SFR to achieve system capacity gains over universal frequency
   reuse.}},

Abstract = {{Design-for-test (DfT) circuitry that employs differential terminals
   inherently suffers from an imbalance in the output of its differential
   pair. By providing the imbalanced differential test stimulus from the
   DfT circuitry, nonlinearity is eventually introduced in a differential
   mixed-signal circuit under test, resulting in low test accuracy and
   significant yield loss during production testing. Consequently, in only
   rare cases are attempts made to measure dynamic performance of
   differential mixed-signal circuits using a self-test approach. This
   brief suggests an efficient testing technique based on built-off
   self-test for differential analog and mixed-signal circuits. This
   technique precisely predicts individual device-under-test (DUT)
   specifications by resolving the imbalance problem using simple variable
   capacitors in loopback mode. The variable capacitor generates predefined
   imbalances to give different weights on the spectral loopback responses.
   Nonlinear models are derived to characterize the DUT specifications
   using the differently weighted loopback responses. The hardware
   measurement results can be used to validate that the proposed method
   should be able to replace the conventional test method.}},

Abstract = {{The radial line slot antenna plasma source is a high-density microwave
   plasma source comprising a high electron temperature source region
   within the plasma skin depth from a coupling window and low electron
   temperature diffusion region far from the window. The plasma is
   typically comprised of inert gases like argon and mixtures of halogen or
   fluorocarbon gases for etching. Following the experimental study of Tian
   et al. {[}J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 24, 1421 (2006)], a two-dimensional
   computational model is used to describe the essential features of the
   source. A high density argon plasma is described using the quasi-neutral
   approximation and coupled to a frequency-domain electromagnetic wave
   solver to describe the plasma-microwave interactions in the source. The
   plasma is described using a multispecies plasma chemistry mechanism
   developed specifically for microwave excitation conditions. The plasma
   is nonlocal by nature with locations of peak power deposition and peak
   plasma density being very different. The spatial distribution of
   microwave power coupling depends on whether the plasma is under- or
   over-dense and is described well by the model. The model predicts the
   experimentally observed low-order diffusion mode radial plasma profiles.
   The trends of spatial profiles of electron density and electron
   temperature over a wide range of power and pressure conditions compare
   well with experimental results. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen sorption between -20 degrees C and 70 degrees C and at
   pressures up to 60 bara was determined for a polyimide and corresponding
   thermally rearranged (TR) polymers prepared from
   3,3'-dihydroxy-4,4'-diamino-biphenyl (HAB) and
   2,2'-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA).
   Hydrogen sorption increased by a factor of approximately 2.6 between the
   polyimide precursor and the most highly converted TR polymer. This
   relative increase in sorption was similar to that observed for other
   non-polar light gases such as N-2, O-2, and CH4, but less than that
   observed for CO2. Additionally, H-2 sorption was measured for other
   polymers commonly studied in the membrane literature, including AF 2400,
   Matrimid (R), polysulfone, and poly(dimethylsiloxane). Among the glassy
   polymers tested, polysulfone had the lowest H-2 sorption, and the
   HAB-6FDA TR polymer had the highest H-2 sorption. A slight dual-mode
   curvature was observed for H-2 sorption in several of the glassy
   materials, and it was most pronounced at low temperatures and for the TR
   polymers. Enthalpies of sorption were also determined. The most

Abstract = {{Mutual information (MI) quantifies the statistical dependency between a
   pair of random variables, and plays a central role in the analysis of
   engineering and biological systems. Estimation of MI is difficult due to
   its dependence on an entire joint distribution, which is difficult to
   estimate from samples. Here we discuss several regularized estimators
   for MI that employ priors based on the Dirichlet distribution. First, we
   discuss three ``quasi-Bayesian{''} estimators that result from linear
   combinations of Bayesian estimates for conditional and marginal
   entropies. We show that these estimators are not in fact Bayesian, and
   do not arise from a well-defined posterior distribution and may in fact
   be negative. Second, we show that a fully Bayesian MI estimator proposed
   by Hutter (2002), which relies on a fixed Dirichlet prior, exhibits
   strong prior dependence and has large bias for small datasets. Third, we
   formulate a novel Bayesian estimator using a mixture-of-Dirichlets
   prior, with mixing weights designed to produce an approximately flat
   prior over MI. We examine the performance of these estimators with a
   variety of simulated datasets and show that, surprisingly,
   quasi-Bayesian estimators generally outperform our Bayesian estimator.
   We discuss outstanding challenges for MI estimation and suggest
   promising avenues for future research.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study of the numerical solution of the two dimensional
   electrical impedance tomography problem, with noisy measurements of the
   Dirichlet to Neumann map. The inversion uses parametrizations of the
   conductivity on optimal grids. The grids are optimal in the sense that
   finite volume discretizations on them give spectrally accurate
   approximations of the Dirichlet to Neumann map. The approximations are
   Dirichlet to Neumann maps of special resistor networks, that are
   uniquely recoverable from the measurements. Inversion on optimal grids
   has been proposed and analyzed recently, but the study of noise effects
   on the inversion has not been carried out. In this paper we present a
   numerical study of both the linearized and the nonlinear inverse
   problem. We take three different parametrizations of the unknown
   conductivity, with the same number of degrees of freedom. We obtain that
   the parametrization induced by the inversion on optimal grids is the
   most efficient of the three, because it gives the smallest standard
   deviation of the maximum a posteriori estimates of the conductivity,
   uniformly in the domain. For the nonlinear problem we compute the mean
   and variance of the maximum a posteriori estimates of the conductivity,
   on optimal grids. For small noise, we obtain that the estimates are
   unbiased and their variance is very close to the optimal one, given by
   the Cramer-Rao bound. For larger noise we use regularization and
   quantify the trade-off between reducing the variance and introducing
   bias in the solution. Both the full and partial measurement setups are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a universal no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (QA)
   index that does not require training on human opinion scores. The new

   image, the entropy of the phase congruencyPC image, the entropy of the
   distorted image, and the mean gradient magnitude of the distorted image.
   Image quality prediction is accomplished by using a simple functional
   relationship of these features. The experimental results show that the

Abstract = {{Modern virtual environments can contain a variety of characters and
   traversable regions. Each character may have different preferences for
   the traversable region types. Pedestrians may prefer to walk on
   sidewalks, but they may occasionally need to traverse roads and dirt
   paths. By contrast, wild animals might try to stay in forest areas, but
   they are able to leave their protective environment when necessary. This
   paper presents a novel path planning method named Modified Indicative
   Routes and Navigation (MIRAN) that takes a character's region
   preferences into account. Given an indicative route as a rough
   estimation of a character's preferred route, MIRAN efficiently computes
   a visually convincing path that is smooth, keeps clearance from
   obstacles, avoids unnecessary detours, and allows local changes to avoid
   other characters. To the best of our knowledge, MIRAN is the first path
   planning method that supports the aforementioned features while using an
   exact representation of the navigable space. Experiments show that with
   our approach, a wide range of different character behaviors can be
   simulated. It also overcomes problems that occur in previous path
   planning methods such as the Indicative Route Method. The resulting
   paths are well suited for real-time simulations and gaming applications.

Abstract = {{Many companies spend significant amounts of money and time on reverse
   logistics which mainly deal with transporting and handling returned
   products. Therefore, efficient management of return products is an
   urgent and interesting issue facing the companies. This paper presents a
   facility location problem of the integrated logistics network aiming to
   improve the efficiency of both forward and reverse logistics. Three
   types of facilities are identified: Warehouses (forward logistics),
   collection centers (reverse logistics) and hybrid facilities (both
   forward and reverse logistics). Instead of the traditional static
   problem, the paper proposes a nonlinear mixed integer model addressing
   the dynamic integrated forward and reverse distribution network design
   problem for 3PLs (Third Party Logistics Providers). A bi-objective model
   is developed to minimize the total shipping cost and time
   simultaneously. An example is tested to evaluate the model.}},

Abstract = {{Differentiating treatment-induced necrosis from tumor recurrence is a
   central challenge in neuro-oncology. These 2 very different outcomes
   after brain tumor treatment often appear similarly on routine follow-up
   imaging studies. They may even manifest with similar clinical symptoms,
   further confounding an already difficult process for physicians
   attempting to characterize a new contrast-enhancing lesion appearing on
   a patients follow-up imaging. Distinguishing treatment necrosis from
   tumor recurrence is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, and
   therefore, much effort has been put forth to develop noninvasive methods
   to differentiate between these disparate outcomes. In this article, we
   review the latest developments and key findings from research studies
   exploring the efficacy of structural and functional imaging modalities
   for differentiating treatment necrosis from tumor recurrence. We discuss
   the possibility of computational approaches to investigate the
   usefulness of fine-grained imaging characteristics that are difficult to
   observe through visual inspection of images. We also propose a flexible
   treatment-planning algorithm that incorporates advanced functional
   imaging techniques when indicated by the patients routine follow-up
   images and clinical condition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to determine unique features in voltage and current

   consists of analyzing sets of known events caused by similar external
   agents to identify unique features characterizing the set and at the
   same time discriminate the remaining event subset. The proposed
   methodology has been implemented and tested using real-world fault
   events with a classification rate of 93.4\%. This result demonstrates a
   good performance in identifying the cause of the events. In addition,
   the methodology rejects those events that do not follow any cause.

Abstract = {{Objectives: To identify the clinical measures associated with improved
   walking speed after locomotor rehabilitation in individuals poststroke
   and how those who respond with clinically meaningful changes in walking
   speed differ from those with smaller speed increases.
   Design: A single group pre-post intervention study. Participants were
   stratified on the basis of a walking speed change of greater than
   (responders) or less than (nonresponders) .16m/s. Paired sample t tests
   were run to assess changes in each group, and correlations were run
   between the change in each variable and change in walking speed.
   Setting: Outpatient interdisciplinary rehabilitation research center.
   Participants: Hemiparetic subjects (N=27) (17 left hemiparesis; 19 men;
   age: 58.74 +/- 12.97y; 22.70 +/- 16.38mo poststroke).
   Intervention: A 12-week locomotor intervention incorporating training on
   a treadmill with body weight support and manual trainers accompanied by
   training overground walking.
   Main Outcome Measures: Measures of motor control, balance, functional
   walking ability, and endurance were collected at pre- and
   postintervention assessments.
   Results: Eighteen responders and 9 nonresponders differed by age
   (responders=63.6y, nonresponders=49.0y, P=.001) and the lower extremity
   Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (responders=24.7, nonresponders=19.9,
   P=.003). Responders demonstrated an average improvement of .27m/s in
   walking speed as well as significant gains in all variables except daily
   step activity and paretic step ratio. Conversely, nonresponders
   demonstrated statistically significant improvements only in walking
   speed and endurance. However, the walking speed increase of .10m/s was
   not clinically meaningful. Change in walking speed was negatively
   correlated with changes in motor control in the nonresponder group,
   implying that walking speed phis may have been accomplished via
   compensatory mechanisms.
   Conclusions: This study is a step toward discerning the underlying
   factors contributing to improved walking performance. Archives of

Abstract = {{This paper considers the two-cell two-hop multiple-input-multiple-output
   (MIMO) interference channel, where two source groups consisting of
   multiple users with a single antenna wish to communicate with two
   multiantenna destinations by sharing two multiantenna relays. For such a
   channel, an inner bound on the degrees of freedom is derived for
   different channel knowledge assumptions and relay operations. Assuming
   global channel knowledge at the relays and full-duplex relay operation,
   it is shown that two cascaded interfering links can be decomposed into
   two independent parallel relay channels while sharing the spectrum. The
   key to showing this result is a novel amplify-and-forward
   interference-free relay transmission method, which performs
   interference-shaping during reception and interference neutralization
   during transmission. Assuming that the relays have global channel
   knowledge only for the first hop, a spectrally efficient relaying
   protocol is proposed that overcomes the loss due to half-duplex relaying
   constraint. The proposed protocol improves performance compared to a
   trivial time-division-multiple access method for the two-cell two-hop
   MIMO interference channel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a numerical study on thermal radiation transport in a
   novel material called dry water. Dry water is a water-in-air inverse
   foam which consists of micrometer-sized water droplets encapsulated by
   hydrophobic fumed-silica nanoparticles. First, the size distribution of
   dry water was measured using a particle size analyzer. Then, the
   radiation characteristics of dry water were obtained using the Mie
   theory for coated spheres. One-dimensional, steady radiative transport
   in fluidized dry water system was modeled using the radiative transport
   equation (RTE) and was solved spectrally with the discrete ordinates
   method. The effects of silica coating and water droplet size as well as
   the volume fraction of dry water particles on reducing radiative heat
   transfer were studied parametrically. The results obtained using the
   size distributions from experimental measurements at a volume fraction
   of 10(-4) showed that dry water reduced the local radiative heat flux by
   more than 60\% with respect to that by silica particles alone whereas
   its performance was comparable to that of fine water mists. Moreover,
   reduction of the diameter of dry water particles from 150 to 50 mu m and
   increasing their volume fraction from 10(-4) to 10(-3) decreased the
   radiative heat flux by 45\% and 67\%, respectively. Dry water is a novel
   and unique material that does not require high pressure fluid lines for
   producing fine mists and features a silica shell that can serve to
   encapsulate water soluble compounds, retard water evaporation from the
   core as well as increase scattering. With these unique features, dry
   water finds diverse engineering applications serving as a base for
   photo-catalytic nanoreactors, gas and chemical storage and delivery
   systems, as well as alternative mist systems in firefighting. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Oscillatory shear is a widely used characterization technique for
   complex fluids but the microstructural changes that produce the material
   response are not well understood. We apply a recent micromechanical
   model to soft particle glasses subjected to oscillatory flow. We use
   particle scale simulations at small, intermediate and large strain
   amplitudes to determine their microstructure, particle scale mobility,
   and macroscopic rheology. The macroscopic properties computed from
   simulations quantitatively agree with experimental measurements on
   well-characterized microgel suspensions, which validate the model. At
   the mesoscopic scale, the evolution of the particle pair distribution
   during a cycle reveals the physical mechanisms responsible for yielding
   and flow and also leads to quantitative prediction of shear stress. At
   the local scale, the particles remain trapped inside their surrounding
   cage below the yield strain and yielding is associated with the onset of
   large scale rearrangements and shear-induced diffusion. This multiscale
   analysis thus highlights the distinct microscopic events that make these
   glasses exhibit a combination of solid-like and liquid-like behavior.

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{740-766}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews the material design and fabrication of a class of
   membranes where some larger molecules can permeate faster than smaller
   ones, or so-called reverse-selective membranes, for conventional gas or
   vapor separation applications. The main requirements for a good
   reverse-selective gas or vapor separation membrane are high
   permeability, good separation capability, stable performance and
   sufficient mechanical properties to withstand the harsh environments in
   commercial separation processes. High permeability in reverse-selective
   membranes is achieved by tuning the fractional free volume (FFV)
   content, i.e., free spaces for penetrant diffusion, while facilitating
   preferential interaction between functional moieties of the membrane
   material and penetrant molecules to enhance penetrant sorption, and
   suppressing crystallinity where applicable. The separation capabilities
   of these membranes are generally controlled by the preferential sorption
   of larger condensable penetrants over smaller penetrants rather than
   size-selective diffusion common for conventional gas separation
   polymers. Reverse-selective gas separation membranes have attracted much
   attention owing to their advantages for certain commercial gas
   separation applications. This review summarizes the different aspects of
   polymeric reverse-selective gas separation membranes reported in the
   literature and comments briefly on their commercialization potential.

Abstract = {{This work explores the application of two distinctive spatial methods
   for prediction of average daily traffic counts across the Texas network.
   Results based on Euclidean distances are compared to those using network
   distances, and both allow for strategic spatial interpolation of count
   values while controlling for each roadway's functional classification,
   lane count, speed limit, and other site attributes. Both universal
   kriging and geographically weighted regression (GWR) are found to reduce
   errors (in practically and statistically significant ways) over
   non-spatial regression techniques, though errors remain quite high at
   some sites, particularly those with low counts and/or in less
   measurement-dense areas. Nearly all tests indicated that the predictive
   capabilities of kriging exceed those of GWR by average absolute errors
   of 3-8\%. Interestingly, the estimation of kriging parameters by network
   distances show no enhanced performance over Euclidean distances, which
   require less data and are much more easily computed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A stochastic thin-layer method is developed for the analysis of wave
   propagation in a layered half-space. A random field of shear moduli in
   the layered system is considered in terms of multiple correlated random
   variables. Expanding the random moduli and uncertain responses by means
   of Hermite polynomial chaos expansions and applying the Galerkin method
   in the spatial as well as stochastic domains, stochastic versions of
   thin-layer methods for a layered half-space in plane strain and
   antiplane shear are obtained. In order to represent the infinite
   half-space, continued-fraction absorbing boundary conditions are
   included in the thin-layer models of the half-space. Using these
   stochastic methods, dynamic responses of a layered half-space subjected
   to line loads are examined. Means, coefficients of variance, and
   probability density functions of the half-space responses with a varying
   correlation coefficient of the shear moduli are computed and verified by
   comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated that
   accurate probabilistic dynamic analysis is possible using the developed
   stochastic thin-layer methods for a layered half-space. Published by

Abstract = {{Hurricanes in southeastern Louisiana develop significant surges within
   the lower Mississippi River. Storms with strong sustained easterly winds
   push water into shallow Breton Sound, overtop the river's east bank
   south of Pointe a la Hache, Louisiana, penetrate into the river, and are
   confined by levees on the west bank. The main channel's width and depth
   allow surge to propagate rapidly and efficiently up river. This work
   refines the high-resolution, unstructured mesh, wave current Simulating
   Waves Nearshore + Advanced Circulation (SWAN + ADCIRC) SL16 model to
   simulate river flow and hurricane-driven surge within the Mississippi
   River. A river velocity regime-based variation in bottom friction and a
   temporally variable riverine flow-driven radiation boundary condition
   are essential to accurately model these processes for high and/or
   time-varying flows. The coupled modeling system is validated for
   riverine flow stage relationships, flow distributions within the
   distributary systems, tides, and Hurricane Gustav (2008) riverine

Abstract = {{A novel strategy for affinity-based surface modification of the
   conducting polymer, polypyrrole, (PPy), has been developed. A 12-amino
   acid peptide (THRTSTLDYFVI, hereafter denoted T59) was previously
   identified via the phage display technique. This peptide noncovalently
   binds to the chlorine-doped conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPyCl).
   Studies have previously shown that conductive polymers have promising
   application in neural electrodes, sensors, and for improving
   regeneration and healing of peripheral nerves and other tissues. Thus,
   the strong and specific attachment of bioactive molecules to the surface
   of PPy using the T59 affinity peptide is an exciting new approach to
   enhance the bioactivity of electrically active materials for various
   biomedical applications. We demonstrate this by using T59 as a tether to
   modify PPyCl with the laminin fragment IKVAV to enhance cell
   interactions, as well as with the so-called stealth molecule
   poly(ethylene glycol; PEG) to decrease cell interactions. Using these
   two modification strategies, we were able to control cell attachment and
   neurite extension on the PPy surface, which is critical for different
   applications (i.e., the goal for tissue regeneration is to enhance cell
   interactions, whereas the goal for electrode and sensor applications is
   to reduce glial cell interactions and thus decrease scarring).
   Significantly, the conductivity of the PPyCl surface was unaffected by
   this surface modification technique, which is not the case with other
   methods that have been explored to surface modify conducting polymers.
   Finally, using subcutaneous implants, we confirmed that the PPyCl
   treated with the T59 peptide did not react in vivo differently than
   untreated PPyCl. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

Abstract = {{Deployment of field robots in unstructured environments continues to
   rise, and the electrochemical battery remains the de facto standard for
   energy storage in robotic applications. However, robot mission planning,
   which relies on battery depletion time information, enforces
   conservative operation due to the lack of statistical rigor on the
   run-time predictions. A two-tier self-supervised load characterization
   methodology for mobile robots operating in unstructured environments is
   proposed. Coupled with load characterization, a model-based statistical
   battery remaining run-time prediction algorithm utilizing particle
   filtering is presented. Given measured power loads during operation, the
   characterization algorithm employs Gaussian mixture modeling to cluster
   measured loads into a priori unknown regions. With clustered power
   demand regions, the computation of transition probabilities between the
   mixture models provides a jump Markov characterization of the historical
   power loads. An experimental study utilized Packbot data gathered during
   operation on general desert terrain. A particle filter prediction
   framework was shown to more accurately predict the remaining run-time of
   the Packbot given the unstructured terrain compared to existing
   load-averaging techniques. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   which allows for efficient sampling in the high-dimensional parameter
   space. We introduce the idea of ``irreducible{''} uncertainty when
   considering other parameters in the system. Nine stochastic models are
   constructed depending on the choice of uncertainties, hydrogen
   concentration, gas temperature, pressure, and rate coefficients of other
   reactions. The sensitivity analysis of uncertainty in k(1) on these
   uncertainty parameters is performed. It is shown that the introduction
   of ``irreducible{''} uncertainty does not always increase the
   uncertainty of In addition, we observe the high sensitivity of
   uncertainty in k(1) to the uncertainty in the measured time-shift. Our
   results show the strong temperature dependence of the uncertainty in the

Abstract = {{Myriad new applications of proteases would be enabled by an ability to
   fine-tune substrate specificity and activity. Herein we present a
   general strategy for engineering protease selectivity and activity by
   capitalizing on sequestration of the protease to be engineered within
   the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A substrate fusion protein
   composed of yeast adhesion receptor subunit Aga2, selection and
   counterselection substrate sequences, multiple intervening epitope tag
   sequences, and a C-terminal ER retention sequence is coexpressed with a
   protease library. Cleavage of the substrate fusion protein by the
   protease eliminates the ER retention sequence, facilitating transport to
   the yeast surface. Yeast cells that display Aga2 fusions in which only
   the selection substrate is cleaved are isolated by multicolor FACS with
   fluorescently labeled antiepitope tag antibodies. Using this system, the
   Tobacco Etch Virus protease (TEV-P), which strongly prefers Gln at P1 of
   its canonical ENLYFQ down arrow S substrate, was engineered to recognize
   selectively Glu or His at P1. Kinetic analysis indicated an overall
   5,000-fold and 1,100-fold change in selectivity, respectively, for the
   Glu- and His-specific TEV variants, both of which retained high
   catalytic turnover. Human granzyme K and the hepatitis C virus protease
   were also shown to be amenable to this unique approach. Further, by
   adjusting the signaling strategy to identify phosphorylated as opposed
   to cleaved sequences, this unique system was shown to be compatible with
   the human Abelson tyrosine kinase.}},

Title = {{A computational analysis of graphene adhesion on amorphous silica}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{We present a computational analysis of the morphology and adhesion
   energy of graphene on the surface of amorphous silica (a-SiO2). The
   a-SiO2 model surfaces obtained from the continuous random network
   model-based Metropolis Monte Carlo approach show Gaussian-like height
   distributions with an average standard deviation of 2.91 +/- 0.56
   angstrom, in good agreement with existing experimental measurements
   (1.68-3.7 angstrom). Our calculations clearly demonstrate that the
   optimal adhesion between graphene and a-SiO2 occurs when the graphene
   sheet is slightly less corrugated than the underlying a-SiO2 surface.
   From morphology analysis based on fast Fourier transform, we find that
   graphene may not conform well to the relatively small jagged features of
   the a-SiO2 surface with wave lengths of smaller than 2 nm, although it
   generally exhibits high-fidelity conformation to a-SiO2 topographic
   features. For 18 independent samples, on average the van der Waals
   interaction at the graphene/a-SiO2 interface is predicted to vary from
   E-vdW = 0.93 eV to 1.56 eV per unit cross-sectional area (nm(2)) of the
   a-SiO2 slab, depending on the choice of 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential
   parameters, while the predicted strain energy of corrugated graphene on
   a-SiO2 is E-st = 0.25-0.36 eV/nm(2). The calculation results yield the
   graphene/a-SiO2 adhesion energy of about E-ad =0.7-1.2 eV/nm, given E-ad
   = E-vdW-E-st. We also discuss how the adhesive strength is affected by
   the morphological conformity between the graphene sheet and the a-SiO2
   surface. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Microporous polymer membranes were fabricated by extrusion, thermal
   annealing, and subsequent biaxial stretching of beta nucleated isotactic
   polypropylene. Fabrication conditions were optimized based on prior
   studies so that the influence of annealing on the precursor film
   crystallinity and the pore formation in such films upon stretching could
   be investigated. Annealing perfected the crystalline structure of these
   materials, as evidenced by thermal and x-ray techniques. A mechanism
   detailing the annealing and pore formation process during biaxial
   stretching is presented. An appropriate metric was developed to relate
   the crystallinity of the precursor films to the porosity of the films
   after biaxially stretching. The porosity developed in biaxially
   stretched films increased substantially when its precursor was annealed
   near the melting temperature of beta crystalline material, enabling the
   production of high permeability microporous membranes. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticles that can be transported in subsurface reservoirs
   at high salinities and temperatures are expected to have a major impact
   on enhanced oil recovery, carbon dioxide sequestration, and
   electromagnetic imaging. Herein we report a rare example of steric
   stabilization of iron oxide (10) nanoparticles (NPs) grafted with
   poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate-co-acrylic acid)
   (poly-(AMPS-co-AM) that not only display colloidal stability in standard
   American Petroleum Institute (API) brine (8\% NaCI + 2\% CaCl2 by
   weight) at 90 C for 1 month but also resist undesirable adsorption on
   silica surfaces (0.4\% monolayer NPs). Because the AMPS groups
   interacted weakly with Ca2+, they were sufficiently well solvated to
   provide steric stabilization. The PAA groups, in contrast, enabled
   covalent grafting of the poly(AMPS-co-AA) chains to amine-functionalized
   10 NPs via formation of amide bonds and prevented polymer desorption
   even after a 40000-fold dilution. The aforementioned methodology may be
   readily adapted to stabilize a variety of other functional inorganic and
   organic NPs at high salinities and temperatures.}},

Title = {{The effect of purge environment on thermal rearrangement of
   ortho-functional polyamide and polyimide}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},

Abstract = {{The effects of nitrogen and air purge during thermal rearrangement of an
   ortho-functional polyamide (o-PA) and an ortho-functional polyimide
   (o-PI) towards a polybenzoxazole (PBO) structure have been investigated
   in terms of physicochemical changes and gas transport properties. The
   o-PA polymer was prepared from 2,2-bis(3-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl)
   hexafluropropane (BisAPAF) and 4,4'-biphenyl-dicarbonyl chloride (BPDC)
   while the o-PI polymer was derived from 4,4-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)
   diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) and 3,3'-dihydroxybenzidine (HAB).
   Experimental results show that the purge environment for the conditions
   used does not affect the thermal rearrangement of the o-PA film but
   significantly affects the thermal conversion of the o-PI film. Nearly
   identical chemical structures and pure gas permeability values are
   observed for o-PA films thermally treated at 300 degrees C under air or
   N-2. These properties become different in the o-PA films treated at 425
   degrees C, which is presumed to be attributed to the influence of oxygen
   on the thermal stability of the derived PBO and probably the various
   degrees of thermal crosslinking reaction induced at a high temperature.
   The o-PI film was thermally rearranged at 425 degrees C because its
   thermal conversion takes place at a higher temperature range of 300
   degrees C-450 degrees C. The o-PI film thermally rearranged in air
   exhibits improved gas permeation properties but significantly
   deteriorated mechanical properties. The air purge interrupts the thermal
   conversion of the ortho-functional imide to benzoxazole by oxidatively
   degrading the imide structure and forming the imine structure. As a
   result, both polymer structure and film properties change. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Perovskites are of great interest as replacements for precious metals
   and oxides used in bifunctional air electrodes involving the oxygen
   evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we
   report the synthesis and activity of a phase-pure nanocrystal perovskite
   catalyst that is highly active for the OER and ORR. The OER mass
   activity of LaNiO3, synthesized by the calcination of a rapidly dried
   nanoparticle dispersion and supported on nitrogen-doped carbon, is
   demonstrated to be nearly 3-fold that of 6 nm IrO2 and exhibits no
   hysteresis during oxygen evolution. Moreover, strong OER/ORR
   bifimctionality is shown by the low total overpotential (1.02 V) between
   the reactions, on par or better than that of noble metal catalysts such
   as Pt (1.16 V) and Ir (0.92 V). These results are examined in the
   context of surface hydroxylation, and a new OER cycle is proposed that
   unifies theory and the unique surface properties of LaNiO3.}},

Pages = {{4877-4882}},

Abstract = {{The solvent quality of an aqueous mixture of two good solvents, urea and
   guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), for a hydrophobic polymer was investigated
   using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. A counterintuitive
   collapse of the polymer was found, suggesting that mixing the two
   denaturants reduces the solvent quality. This cononsolvency of the
   polymer in the urea + GdmCl mixture is found to be caused by the
   preferential adsorption of urea on the polymer. The polymer collapses as
   a result of indirect long-range interactions between monomers resulting
   from the presence of urea clouds surrounding them. Surprisingly, urea
   behaves as the better solvent in the mixture not because there exists a
   stronger affinity of the polymer for urea. Instead, attractive
   interactions between two unlike denaturant molecules combined with the
   direct dispersion interactions of the polymer with both denaturants
   determine the solvent quality of the mixture.}},

Title = {{Scaling of Perceptual Errors Can Predict the Shape of Neural Tuning
   Curves}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Weber's law, first characterized in the 19th century, states that errors
   estimating the magnitude of perceptual stimuli scale linearly with
   stimulus intensity. This linear relationship is found in most sensory
   modalities, generalizes to temporal interval estimation, and even
   applies to some abstract variables. Despite its generality and long
   experimental history, the neural basis of Weber's law remains unknown.
   This work presents a simple theory explaining the conditions under which
   Weber's law can result from neural variability and predicts that the
   tuning curves of neural populations which adhere to Weber's law will
   have a log-power form with parameters that depend on spike-count
   statistics. The prevalence of Weber's law suggests that it might be
   optimal in some sense. We examine this possibility, using variational
   calculus, and show that Weber's law is optimal only when observed
   real-world variables exhibit power-law statistics with a specific
   exponent. Our theory explains how physiology gives rise to the
   behaviorally characterized Weber's law and may represent a general
   governing principle relating perception to neural activity. DOI:

Abstract = {{A significant problem in the study of fluid transport in porous media is
   the ability to visualize the structure of the flow field when moisture
   contents vary rapidly in space and time. Here we present a method for
   determining the radial and vertical saturation profiles within
   axisymmetric preferential flow fields using neutron radiography. Flow
   fields such as these are surprisingly common in nature and determining
   the three-dimensional structure of their wetting front region has proven
   difficult. In this work, the moisture profiles are determined using a
   simple algorithm for algebraic computed tomography, which gives the
   three-dimensional structure of the moisture profile with a temporal
   resolution that is limited only by the desired noise level. The
   algorithm presented can be translated to radiography done using X-rays
   or light and is applicable to any rotationally symmetric object. (C)

Title = {{Base calling for high-throughput short-read sequencing: dynamic
   programming solutions}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Next-generation DNA sequencing platforms are capable of
   generating millions of reads in a matter of days at rapidly reducing
   costs. Despite its proliferation and technological improvements, the
   performance of next-generation sequencing remains adversely affected by
   the imperfections in the underlying biochemical and signal acquisition
   procedures. To this end, various techniques, including statistical
   methods, are used to improve read lengths and accuracy of these systems.
   Development of high performing base calling algorithms that are
   computationally efficient and scalable is an ongoing challenge.
   Results: We develop model-based statistical methods for fast and
   accurate base calling in Illumina's next-generation sequencing
   platforms. In particular, we propose a computationally tractable
   parametric model which enables dynamic programming formulation of the
   base calling problem. Forward-backward and soft-output Viterbi
   algorithms are developed, and their performance and complexity are
   investigated and compared with the existing state-of-the-art base
   calling methods for this platform. A C code implementation of our
   algorithm named Softy can be downloaded from
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/dynamicprog.
   Conclusion: We demonstrate high accuracy and speed of the proposed
   methods on reads obtained using Illumina's Genome Analyzer II and
   HiSeq2000. In addition to performing reliable and fast base calling, the
   developed algorithms enable incorporation of prior knowledge which can
   be utilized for parameter estimation and is potentially beneficial in
   various downstream applications.}},

Abstract = {{The deep eutectic solvents (DESs) based on the mixtures of a variety of
   ammonium salts and hydrogen bond donors containing acrylic acids and
   acrylamides are capable of sustaining frontal polymerization (FP). The
   selection of ammonium salt affects the reactivity and allows FP at
   relatively low temperature but with full conversion. Also, full
   conversion allows us to use these polymers for biomedical applications
   (e.g., drug delivery systems) as the unreactive ammonium salts can be
   released from the resulting polymer without by-products. We call these
   components active fillers, which can be ammonium salts with biological
   or pharmaceutical importance. For instance, we prepared poly(acrylic
   acid) loaded with lidocaine hydrochloride (a common anesthetic), the
   release of which was found to occur in a controlled fashion. The
   ammonium salts also create a sufficiently high viscosity to suppress
   buoyancy-driven convection without additional materials. The DES here
   described played an all-in-one role, providing the monomer, the active
   filler, and the polymerization medium for FPs. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper provides the theoretical foundation for the modeling,
   analysis and control of integrated chemical process networks, or, in
   short, ``process networks.{''} The dynamics of process networks is
   represented using state-space descriptions derived from classical
   irreversible thermodynamics and constrained by the second law so that
   dissipation is always non-negative. The state descriptions (models)
   derived from this point of view provide exact process representations. A
   unique, quadratic Lyapunov function for stability analysis and control
   design is derived directly from the entropy. The resulting process
   models are complex and simplifications may be needed in practical
   applications. Time-scale decomposition and singular perturbation theory
   provide the basis for exploring the network-level dynamic behavior that
   emerges as a result of tight inventory integration, and developing
   appropriate reduced-order models and a hierarchy of control systems for
   managing inventories and inventory flows. Model-based networked control
   and Lyapunov theory are leveraged to develop an integrated control and
   communication strategy that manages the information flows between the
   network components and explicitly accounts for communication
   constraints. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Piperazine (PZ) is an efficient amine for carbon capture systems, but it
   can form N-nitrosopiperazine (MNPZ), a carcinogen, from nitrogen oxides
   (NOx) in flue gas from coal or natural gas combustion. The reaction of
   nitrite with PZ was studied in 0.1 to 5 mol/dm(3) PZ with 0.001 to 0.8
   mol CO2/mol PZ at 50 to 135 degrees C. The reaction forming MNPZ is
   first order in nitrite, piperazine carbamate species, and hydronium ion.
   The activation energy is 84 +/- 2 kJ/mol with a rate constant of 8.5 x
   10(3) +/- 1.4 x 10(3) dm(6) mol(-2) s(-1) at 100 degrees C. The proposed
   mechanism involves protonation of the carbamate species, nucleophilic
   attack of the carbamic acid, and formation of bicarbonate and MNPZ.
   These kinetics and mechanism will be useful in identifying inhibitors
   and other strategies to reduce nitrosamine accumulation in CO2 capture
   by scrubbing with PZ or other amines.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The goal of this study was to compare transesophageal
   echocardiography (TEE) and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) for the
   diagnosis of cardiac device-related endocarditis (CDI).
   Background The diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) was established
   by using the modified Duke criteria based mainly on echocardiography and
   blood culture results. No previous studies have compared ICE with TEE
   for the diagnosis of IE.
   Methods We prospectively enrolled 162 patients (age 72 +/- 11 years; 125
   male) who underwent transvenous lead extraction: 152 with CDI and 10
   with lead malfunction (control group). Using the modified Duke criteria,
   we divided the patients with infection into 3 groups: 44 with a
   ``definite{''} diagnosis of IE (group 1), 52 with a ``possible{''}
   diagnosis of IE (group 2), and 56 with a ``rejected{''} diagnosis of IE
   (group 3). TEE and ICE were performed before the procedure.
   Results In group 1, ICE identified intracardiac masses (ICM) in all 44
   patients; TEE identified ICM in 32 patients (73\%). In group 2, 6
   patients (11\%) had ICE and TEE both positive for ICM, 8 patients (15\%)
   had a negative TEE but a positive ICE, and 38 patients (73\%) had ICE
   and TEE both negative. In group 3, 2 patients (3\%) had ICM both at ICE
   and TEE, 1 patient (2\%) had an ICM at ICE and a negative TEE, and 53
   patients (95\%) had no ICM at ICE and TEE. ICE and TEE were both
   negative in the control group.
   Conclusions ICE represents a useful technique for the diagnosis of ICM,
   thus providing improved imaging of right-sided leads and increasing the
   diagnostic yield compared with TEE. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2013;61:1398-405)

Title = {{Characterization of Ion Transport and -Sorption in a Carbon Based Porous

Abstract = {{New and more efficient water desalination technologies have been a topic
   of incipient research over the past few decades. Although the focus has
   been placed on the improvement of membrane-based desalination methods
   such as reverse osmosis, the development of new high surface area
   carbon-based-electrode materials have brought substantial interest
   towards capacitive deionization (CDI), a novel technique that uses an
   electric field to separate the ionic species from the water. Part of the
   new interest on CDI is its ability to store and return a fraction of the
   energy used in the desalination process. This characteristic is not
   common to other electric-field-based desalination methods such as
   electrodeionization and electrodialysis reversal where none of the input
   energy is recoverable. This paper presents work conducted to analyze the
   energy recovery, thermodynamic efficiency, and ionic
   adsorption/desorption rates in a CDI cell using different salt
   concentration solutions and various flow rates. Voltage and electrical
   current measurements are conducted during the desalination and electrode
   regeneration processes and used to evaluate the energy recovery ratio.
   Salinity measurements of the inflow and outflow stream concentrations
   using conductivity probes, alongside the current measurements, are used
   to calculate ion adsorption efficiency. Two analytical species transport
   models are developed to estimate the net ionic adsorption rates in a
   steady-state and nonsaturated porous electrode scenario. Finally, the
   convective and electrokinetic transport times are compared and their
   effect on desalination performance is presented. Steady test results for
   outlet to inlet concentration ratio show a strong dependence on flow
   rate and concentration independence for dilute solutions. In addition,
   transient test results indicate that the net electrical energy
   requirement is dependent on the number of carbon electrode regeneration
   cycles, which is thought to be due to imperfect regeneration. The energy
   requirements and adsorption/desorption rate analyses conducted for this
   waterdesalination process could be extended to other ion-adsorption
   applications such as the reprocessing of lubricants or spent nuclear
   fuels in a near future.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the impact of defects on the resonant response of

   It is observed that increasing the degree of asymmetry in the system

   single-peak Lorentzian frequency responses in the current device design
   paradigm, which is utilized in applications such as resonant mass
   sensing, the non-Lorentzian response characteristics of imperfect
   devices could present both opportunities and challenges in the future

Abstract = {{A new Markov-chain-based energy storage model to evaluate power supply
   availability of photovoltaic generation is proposed. Since photovoltaic
   resources have high output variability subject to weather conditions,
   energy storage can be added in order to increase the availability of
   photovoltaic generation. Although adding energy storage is a promising
   strategy to improve the availability of photovoltaic generation, energy
   storage sizing to meet a certain availability must be taken into account
   in order to avoid over-sizing or under-sizing capacity, which are two
   undesirable conditions leading to increased system cost or inadequate
   availability, respectively. This paper proposes a new Markov-chain-based
   energy storage model to develop a power supply availability framework
   for photovoltaic generation. The proposed work models energy states in a
   photovoltaic-energy storage system in order to understand the nature of
   charge/discharge rates for energy storage that affect the system's power
   output. This developed Markov chain model may assist when planning both
   large and small-scale grid integrated photovoltaic generation because
   energy state's behavior of the photovoltaic-energy storage model can be
   used for forecasting expected power output. In addition, an example
   using lithium-ion batteries is given in order to explore the effects on
   availability of energy storage capacity degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Low-k(1) lithography results in features that suffer from poor
   lithographic yield in the presence of process variation. The problem is
   especially pronounced for lower-level metals used for local routing,
   where bi-directionality and tight pitches give rise to lithography
   unfriendly layout patterns. However, there exists inherent unutilized
   flexibility in design shapes, e. g., one can modify such wires without
   significantly affecting design behavior. We develop two different
   techniques to simultaneously modify mask and design shapes during
   optical proximity correction (OPC) to improve lithographic yield of
   low-level metal layers. The methods utilize image slope information,
   which is available during OPC image simulations at no extra cost, as a
   measure of lithographic process window. We first propose a method that
   identifies fragments with low normalized image log slope (NILS) and then
   use this NILS information to guide dynamic target modification between
   iterations of OPC. The method uses a pre-characterized lookup table to
   assign a different magnitude of local target correction to different
   NILS bins. Next we develop an optimization flow where we derive a cost
   function that maximizes both contour fidelity and robustness to drive
   our simultaneous mask and target optimization (SMATO) method. We develop
   analytical equations to predict the cost for a given mask and target
   modification and use a fast algorithm to minimize this cost function to
   obtain an optimal mask and target solution. Our experiments on sample 1x
   (M1) layouts show that the use of SMATO reduces the process
   manufacturability index (PMI) by 15.4\% compared with OPC, which further
   leads to 69\% reduction in the number of layout hotspots. Additionally,
   such improvement is obtained at low average runtime overhead (5.5\%).
   Compared with process window optical proximity correction (PWOPC), we
   observe 4.6\% improvement in PMI at large (2.6x) improvement in runtime.

   surface water reservoir storage}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{We used a customized, river basin-based model of surface water rights to
   evaluate the response of power plants to drought via simulated changes
   in reservoir storage. Our methodology models surface water rights in 11
   river basins in Texas using five cases: (1) storage decrease of existing
   capacity of 10\%, (2) storage decrease of 50\%, (3) complete elimination
   of storage, (4) storage increase of 10\% (all at existing locations),
   and (5) construction of new reservoirs (at new locations) with a total
   increase in baseline reservoir capacity for power plant cooling of 9\%.
   Using the Brazos River basin as a sample, we evaluated power generation
   operations in terms of reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability. As
   simulated water storage decreases, reliability generally decreases and
   resiliency and vulnerability remain relatively constant. All three
   metrics remain relatively constant with increasing reservoir storage,
   with the exception of one power plant. As reservoir storage changes at
   power plants, other water users in the basin are also affected. In
   general, decreasing water storage is beneficial to other water users in
   the basin, and increasing storage is detrimental for many other users.
   Our analysis reveals basin-wide and individual power plant-level impacts
   of changing reservoir storage, demonstrating a methodology for
   evaluation of the sustainability and feasibility of constructing new
   reservoir storage as a water and energy management approach.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Background: The high physical demands placed on the upper extremity
   during manual wheelchair propulsion can lead to pain and overuse
   injuries that further reduce user independence and quality of life. Seat
   position is an adjustable parameter that can influence the mechanical
   loads placed on the upper extremity. The purpose of this study was to
   use a musculoskeletal model and forward dynamics simulations of
   wheelchair propulsion to identify the optimal seat position that
   minimizes various measures of upper extremity demand including muscle
   stress, co-contraction and metabolic cost.
   Methods: Forward dynamics simulations of wheelchair propulsion were
   generated across a range of feasible seat positions by minimizing the
   change in handrim forces and muscle-produced joint moments. Resulting
   muscle stress, co-contraction and metabolic cost were examined to
   determine the optimal seat position that minimized these values.
   Findings: Muscle stress and metabolic cost were near minimal values at
   superior/inferior positions corresponding to top-dead-center elbow
   angles between 110 and 120 degrees while at an anterior/posterior
   position with a hub-shoulder angle between -10 and -2.5 degrees. This
   coincided with a reduction in the level of muscle co-contraction,
   primarily at the glenohumeral joint.
   Interpretation: Deviations from this position lead to increased
   co-contraction to maintain a stable, smooth propulsive stroke, which
   consequentially increases upper extremity demand. These results agree
   with previous clinical guidelines for positioning the seat to reduce
   upper extremity overuse injuries and pain for wheelchair users. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Molecular machines (MM) are essential components of living cells. They

   Computational studies of these conformational transitions and their
   coupling to molecular functions are discussed. It is argued that coarse
   descriptions of these molecules which are based on mass density and
   shape provide useful information on directions of action. It is further
   argued that MM are likely to have well focused and narrow reaction
   pathways. The proposal for such pathways is supported by evolutionary
   analyses of homologous machines. Finally, these observations are used to
   build atomically detailed models of these systems that are making the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider delay-constrained wireless multi-hop ad hoc
   networks where a packet should be delivered to the destination within
   the maximum allowed delay while satisfying the target outage
   probability. The proposed performance metric for analyzing networks is
   the delay-constrained random access transport capacity (D-RATC), which
   quantifies the maximum end-to-end (e2e) link achievable rate per unit
   area of a delay-constrained network using a random access protocol. The
   scaling of the D-RATC is obtained for various slotted ALOHA (SA)
   protocols and it is shown that the SA protocol is order-optimal for
   delay-constrained random networks when interference control is used with
   an additional feature such as rate control or admission control. If
   interference control is not used, the SA protocol suffers from the
   negatively infinite scaling exponent except the case of using rate
   control where a finite but suboptimal scaling exponent may be achieved.
   Also, it is shown that multi-hop control does not affect the scaling
   exponent but just improves the D-RATC pre-constant.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the central role of mobility in wireless networks, analytical
   study on its impact on network performance is notoriously difficult.
   This paper aims to address this gap by proposing a random waypoint (RWP)
   mobility model defined on the entire plane and applying it to analyze
   two key cellular network parameters: handover rate and sojourn time. We
   first analyze the stochastic properties of the proposed model and
   compare it to two other models: the classical RWP mobility model and a
   synthetic truncated Levy walk model which is constructed from real
   mobility trajectories. The comparison shows that the proposed RWP
   mobility model is more appropriate for the mobility simulation in
   emerging cellular networks, which have ever-smaller cells. Then we apply
   the proposed model to cellular networks under both deterministic
   (hexagonal) and random (Poisson) base station (BS) models. We present
   analytic expressions for both handover rate and sojourn time, which have
   the expected property that the handover rate is proportional to the
   square root of BS density. Compared to an actual BS distribution, we
   find that the Poisson-Voronoi model is about as accurate in terms of
   mobility evaluation as hexagonal model, though being more pessimistic in
   that it predicts a higher handover rate and lower sojourn time.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in nanofabrication have produced increased interest in
   the scattering and emission properties of nanoparticles and confined
   optical sources. In this context, the new area of optical antennas aims
   at achieving the bridge between nanoscale optical sources, light-matter
   interaction and far-field radiation. In some senses the operation of
   optical antennas is analogous to that of conventional radio-frequency
   (RF) antennas, which transfer confined electrical signals into radiated
   propagating electromagnetic waves. Even if their functionality is
   similar, optical and RF antennas show drastic differences in physics,
   material properties and excitation features. In this paper, we review
   some of the concepts of optical antenna theory, design and applications
   and we highlight how the optical nanocircuit paradigm may be applied to
   achieve optical impedance matching, loading and tuning in the optical
   domain. We also provide an overview of how these concepts may have
   relevant applications in a variety of fields of optics, such as sensing,
   optical communications and nonlinear nanodevices.}},

Abstract = {{We propose the concept and design of terahertz (THz) phase shifters for
   phased antenna arrays based on integrally-gated graphene parallel-plate
   waveguides (GPPWGs). We show that an active transmission-line may be
   realized by combining GPPWGs with double-gate electrodes, in which the
   applied gate voltage can control the guiding properties of the gated
   sections. This may enable the realization of THz electronic switches and
   tunable loaded-lines for sub mm-wave antenna systems. Based on these
   active components, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate several
   digital and analog phase shifter designs for THz frequencies, with a
   wide range of phase shifts and small return loss, insertion loss and
   phase error. The proposed graphene-based phase shifters show significant
   advantages over other available technology in this frequency range, as
   they combine the low-loss and compact-size features of GPPWGs with
   electrically-programmable phase tuning. We envision that these
   electronic phase shifters may pave the way to viable phased-arrays and
   beamforming networks for THz communications systems, as well as for
   high-speed, low-RC-delay, inter/intra-chip communications.}},

Abstract = {{The spectrum crunch currently experienced by mobile cellular carriers
   makes the underutilized millimeter-wave frequency spectrum a sensible
   choice for next-generation cellular communications, particularly when
   considering the recent advances in low cost
   sub-terahertz/millimeter-wave complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
   circuitry. To date, however, little is known on how to design or deploy
   practical millimeter-wave cellular systems. In this paper, measurements
   for outdoor cellular channels at 38 GHz were made in an urban
   environment with a broadband (800-MHz RF passband bandwidth) sliding
   correlator channel sounder. Extensive angle of arrival, path loss, and
   multipath time delay spread measurements were conducted for steerable
   beam antennas of differing gains and beamwidths for a wide variety of
   transmitter and receiver locations. Coverage outages and the likelihood
   of outage with steerable antennas were also measured to determine how
   random receiver locations with differing antenna gains and link budgets
   could perform in future cellular systems. This paper provides
   measurements and models that may be used to design future
   fifth-generation millimeter-wave cellular networks and gives insight
   into antenna beam steering algorithms for these systems.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics, thermodynamic, and adsorption studies on removal of
   chromium(VI) from aqueous and in presence of industrial solvents
   2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol with macroporous resin Tulsion A-27
   was studied at varying concentration of Cr(VI), adsorbent dosage, pH,
   contact time, and temperature. Batch shaking sorption experiments were
   carried out to evaluate the performance of Tulsion A-27(MP) anion
   exchange resin in the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous and mixed aqueous
   solvents, 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol. The concentrations of
   Cr(VI) in aqueous and mixed aqueous solvents were determined by
   UV-Visible spectrophotometer. As the adsorption process is pH dependent,
   it showed maximum removal efficiency of Cr(VI) in the pH range of 5-6
   for an initial chromium concentration of 0.0011 M. Effect of temperature
   on the equilibrium constant was studied and the thermodynamic parameters
   were evaluated. Kinetic experiments revealed the dominance of
   adsorption. The sorption models, Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption
   isotherms, were discussed on amount of Cr(VI) uptake. The resin was
   analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy
   before and after the adsorption process. The sorption of Cr(VI) by the
   anion exchange resin was reversible and so it has good potential for the
   removal/recovery of Cr(VI) from aqueous and mixed aqueous solvents. The
   anion exchange resin can be used for the efficient removal of Cr(VI)
   from water and wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a unified generalized eigenvalue based spectrum sensing
   framework referred to as Generalized mean detector (GMD) has been
   introduced. The generalization of the detectors namely (i) the
   eigenvalue ratio detector (ERD) involving the ratio of the largest and
   the smallest eigenvalues; (ii) the Geometric mean detector (GEMD)
   involving the ratio of the largest eigenvalue and the geometric mean of
   the eigenvalues and (iii) the Arithmetic mean detector (ARMD) involving
   the ratio of the largest and the arithmetic mean of the eigenvalues is
   explored. The foundation of the proposed unified framework is based on
   the calculation of exact analytical moments of the random variables of
   test statistics of the respective detectors. In this context, we
   approximate the probability density function (PDF) of the test
   statistics of the respective detectors by Gaussian/Gamma PDF using the
   moment matching method. Finally, we derive closed-form expressions to
   calculate the decision threshold of the eigenvalue based detectors by
   exchanging the derived exact moments of the random variables of test
   statistics with the moments of the Gaussian/Gamma distribution function.
   The performance of the eigenvalue based detectors is compared with the
   traditional detectors such as energy detector (ED) and cyclostationary
   detector (CSD) and validate the importance of the eigenvalue based
   detectors particularly over realistic wireless cognitive environments.
   Analytical and simulation results show that the GEMD and the ARMD yields
   considerable performance advantage in realistic spectrum sensing
   scenarios. Moreover, our results based on proposed simple and tractable
   approximation approaches are in perfect agreement with the empirical
   results.}},

Abstract = {{A time domain analytical solution is presented to calculate the pressure
   response along the axis of a paraboloidal reflector for a normally
   incident plane wave. This work is inspired by Hamilton's axial solution
   for an ellipsoidal mirror and the same methodology is employed in this
   paper. Behavior of the reflected waves along reflector axis is studied,
   and special interest is placed on focusing gain obtained at the focal
   point. This analytical solution indicates that the focusing gain is
   affected by reflector geometry and the time derivative of the input
   signal. In addition, focused pressure response in the focal zone given
   by various reflector geometries and input frequencies are also
   investigated. This information is useful for selecting appropriate
   reflector geometry in a specific working environment to achieve the best
   signal enhancement. Numerical simulation employing the finite element
   method is used to validate the analytical solution, and visualize the
   wave field to provide a better understanding of the propagation of
   reflected waves. This analytical solution can be modified to apply to
   non-planar incident waves with axisymmetric wavefront and non-uniform
   pressure distribution. An example of incident waves with conical-shaped
   wavefront is presented. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{The grain structure in Cu interconnects of the 45 nm node was analyzed
   to yield grain orientation and boundary characteristics using a
   high-resolution electron diffraction technique. A dominant sidewall
   growth of \{111\} grains was observed, reflecting the importance of
   interfacial energy in controlling grain growth below 70 nm linewidth.
   The grain structure was used to identify flux divergent sites for void
   formation under electromigration (EM) and to analyze the effect on EM
   statistics for Cu lines with CoWP capping using a microstructure-based
   model. This analysis established a correlation between the
   microstructure of Cu nanolines, void formation kinetics, and EM
   statistics. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Graphene's success has shown that it is possible to create stable,
   single and few-atom-thick layers of van der Waals materials, and also
   that these materials can exhibit fascinating and technologically useful
   properties. Here we review the state-of-the-art of 2D materials beyond
   graphene. Initially, we will outline the different chemical classes of
   2D materials and discuss the various strategies to prepare single-layer,
   few-layer, and multilayer assembly materials in solution, on substrates,
   and on the wafer scale. Additionally, we present an experimental guide
   for identifying and characterizing single-layer-thick materials, as well
   as outlining emerging techniques that yield both local and global
   information. We describe the differences that occur in the electronic
   structure between the bulk and the single layer and discuss various
   methods of tuning their electronic properties by manipulating the
   surface. Finally, we highlight the properties and advantages of single-,
   few-, and many-layer 2D materials in field-effect transistors, spin- and
   valley-tronics, thermoelectrics, and topological insulators, among many
   other applications.}},

Abstract = {{Bottom-up assembling of Micro/Nano Electromechanical System (MEMS/NEMS)
   devices from nanoscale building blocks is highly desirable but extremely
   difficult to achieve. In this work, we report innovative mechanisms for
   precision assembly and actuation of arrays of nanowire NEMS devices that
   can synchronously oscillate between two designated positions for over
   4000 cycles. The assembly and actuation mechanisms are based on unique
   magnetic interactions between nanoentities with perpendicular magnetic
   anisotropy (PMA) and electric-tweezer manipulation, our recent
   invention. Quantitative analysis of the dynamics of torques involved in
   the nano-oscillators reveals that the induced electrostatic torques due
   to the external electric fields between metallic NEMS components play a
   significant role in the mechanical actuation. These new findings are
   expected to inspire new in situ assembly and actuation strategies in the
   general field of NEMS devices such as nanomechanical switches for
   toggling on/off circuits and nanoresonators for biochemical sensors and
   radio frequency communication.}},

Abstract = {{Glucose enzyme biosensors have been shown useful for a range of
   applications from medical diagnosis, bioprocess monitoring, to beverage
   industry and environmental monitoring. We present here a highly
   sensitive glucose enzyme sensor based on Pt nanoparticles
   (PtNPs)-polyaniline (PAni) hydrogel heterostructures. High-density PtNPs
   were homogeneously loaded onto the three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured
   matrix of the PAni hydrogel. The PtNP/PAni hydrogel
   heterostructure-based glucose sensor synergizes the advantages of both
   the conducting hydrogel and the nanoparticle catalyst. The porous
   structure of the PAni hydrogel favored the high density immobilization
   of the enzyme and the penetration of water-soluble molecules, which
   helped efficiently catalyze the oxidation of glucose. In addition, the
   PtNPs catalyzed the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide that was
   generated during the enzymatic reaction. The transferred charges from
   these electrochemical processes were efficiently collected by the highly
   conducting PtNP/PAni hydrogel heterostructures. The glucose enzyme
   sensor based on this heterostructure exhibited unprecedented
   sensitivity, as high as 96.1 mu A.mM(-1).cm(-2), with a response time as
   fast as 3 s, a linear range of 0.01 to 8 mM, and a low detection limit

Abstract = {{The acidic ionic liquid 1-H-3-methylimidazolium chloride can effectively
   pretreat yellow pine wood chips under mild conditions for enzymatic
   saccharification. Wood samples were treated at temperatures between 110
   and 150 degrees C for up to 5 h in the ionic liquid and three fractions
   collected; a cellulose rich fraction, lignin, and an aqueous fraction.
   This treatment caused the hemicellulose and the lignin to be degraded
   and dissolved from the cell walls of the pine wood. The lignin was
   depolymerized and subsequently dissolved in the ionic liquid. This
   process occurred more quickly at higher temperatures, although at the
   highest temperatures tested, significant cellulose degradation also
   occurred. The cellulose rich fraction was saccharified using cellulase
   from Trichoderma viride, with longer pretreatment times at 130 degrees C
   resulting in higher glucose yields. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Zirconium dioxide has received particular attention as a fuel matrix
   because of its ability to form a solid solution with transuranic
   elements, natural radiation stability and desirable mechanical
   properties. However, zirconium dioxide has a lower coefficient of
   thermal conductivity than uranium dioxide and this presents an obstacle
   to the deployment of these fuels in commercial reactors. Here we show
   that axial doping of a zirconium dioxide based fuel with erbium reduces
   power peaking and fuel temperature. Full core simulations of a modified
   AP1000 core were done using MCNPX 2.7.0. The inert matrix fuel contained
   15 w/o transuranics at its beginning of life and constituted 28\% of the
   assemblies in the core. Axial doping reduced power peaking at startup by
   more than similar to 23\% in the axial direction and reduced the peak to
   average power within the core from 1.80 to 1.44. The core was able to
   remain critical between refueling while running at a simulated 2000 MWth
   on an 18 month refueling cycle. The results show that the reactor would
   maintain negative core average reactivity and void coefficients during
   operation. This type of fuel cycle would reduce the overall production
   of transuranics in a pressurized water reactor by 86\%.}},

Abstract = {{Providing uniformly high capacity in cellular systems is challenging due
   to fading, path loss, and interference. A partial solution to this
   problem is the deployment of distributed antenna systems, where
   transmission points are distributed throughout the cell using coax cable
   or fiber, instead of being centrally located on a single tower. This
   article reviews how distributed antenna systems are evolving to provide
   higher performance on the downlink in cellular systems. Research trends
   in distributed antennas for the downlink of cellular systems are
   described along with current progress on their integration into
   commercial wireless cellular standards. A key observation is that
   distributed antenna systems are tightly integrated into the cellular
   architecture, and incorporate physical layer technologies like MIMO
   communication and multiuser MIMO to provide higher data rates.}},

Title = {{The joint analysis of injury severity of drivers in two-vehicle crashes
   accommodating seat belt use endogeneity}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{74-89}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The current study contributes to the existing injury severity modeling
   literature by developing a multivariate probit model of injury severity
   and seat belt use decisions of both drivers involved in two-vehicle
   crashes. The modeling approach enables the joint modeling of the injury
   severity of multiple individuals involved in a crash, while also
   recognizing the endogeneity of seat belt use in predicting injury
   severity levels as well as accommodating unobserved heterogeneity in the
   effects of variables. The proposed model is applied to analyze the
   injury severity of drivers involved in two-vehicle road crashes in
   Denmark.
   The empirical analysis provides strong support for the notion that
   people offset the restraint benefits of seat belt use by driving more
   aggressively. Also, men and those individuals driving heavy vehicles
   have a lower injury risk than women and those driving lighter vehicles,
   respectively. At the same time, men and individuals driving heavy
   vehicles pose more of a danger to other drivers on the roadway when
   involved in a crash. Other important determinants of injury severity
   include speed limit on roadways where crash occurs, the presence (or
   absence) of center dividers (median barriers), and whether the crash
   involves a head-on collision. These and other results are discussed,
   along with implications for countermeasures to reduce injury severities
   in crashes. The analysis also underscores the importance of considering
   injury severity at a crash level, while accommodating seat belt
   endogeneity effects and unobserved heterogeneity effects. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Residual polymer (here, poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA) left on
   graphene from transfer from metals or device fabrication processes
   affects its electrical and thermal properties. We have found that the
   amount of polymer residue left after the transfer of chemical vapor
   deposited (CVD) graphene varies depending on the initial concentration
   of the polymer solution, and this residue influences the electrical
   performance of graphene field-effect transistors fabricated on SiO2/Si.
   A PMMA solution with lower concentration gave less residue after
   exposure to acetone, resulting in less p-type doping in graphene and
   higher charge carrier mobility. The electrical properties of the weakly
   p-doped graphene could be further enhanced by exposure to formamide with
   the Dirac point at nearly zero gate voltage and a more than 50\%
   increase of the room-temperature charge carrier mobility in air. This
   can be attributed to electron donation to graphene by the -NH2
   functional group in formamide that is absorbed in the polymer residue.
   This work provides a route to enhancing the electrical properties of
   CVD-grown graphene even when it has a thin polymer coating.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{164-174}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Unilateral nigrostriatal dopamine depletion in animals induces
   contralateral sensorimotor deficits that are like symptoms associated
   with Parkinson's disease (PD). Unilateral nigrostriatal dopamine
   depletion also causes a contralateral deficit in disengagement behavior
   (e. g., ability to stop an ongoing activity to orient/attend to a new
   stimulus). This disengagement deficit has been shown to be resistant to
   treatments that rescued other motor and somatosensory deficits. Thus,
   disengagement behavior may involve unique sensorimotor information
   integration potentially important for attentional allocation and may
   rely strongly on a mechanism that includes extranigrostriatal circuitry.
   The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and its connections with the
   nigral dopamine system have been reported to modulate cognitive
   processes dependent substantially on attentional allocation. CeA
   dopamine function might be also important for disengagement behavior. In
   Experiment 1, rats received microinfusions of 6-hydroxydopamine
   unilaterally to induce dopamine terminal loss in the CeA and were tested
   for disengagement behavior in addition to several sensorimotor
   functions. These rats showed deficits in contralateral disengagement
   behavior and an asymmetry in adhesive dot removal from the paws, but not
   in forelimb use in a cylinder or amphetamine rotation. In Experiment 2,
   rats received D1 or D2 antagonists into the CeA unilaterally prior to
   behavioral tests. The D1 antagonist disrupted disengagement behavior
   without affecting the other sensorimotor tests examined. The D2
   antagonist had no effects on any of the behaviors tested. Our results
   suggest that CeA dopamine function is involved in modulation of
   disengagement behavior.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the design of thin flexible pressure sensors based on
   piezoelectric PVDF-TrFE (polyvinyledenedifluoride-tetrafluoroethylene)
   co-polymer film, which can be integrated onto a catheter, where the
   compact inner lumen space limit the dimensions of the pressure sensors.
   Previously, we demonstrated that the thin-film sensors of one micrometer
   thickness were shown to have better performance compared to the thicker
   film with no additional electrical poling or mechanical stretching due
   to higher crystallinity. The pressure sensors can be mass producible
   using standard lithography process, with excellent control of film
   uniformity and thickness down to one micrometer. The fabricated pressure
   sensors were easily mountable on external surface of commercial
   catheters. Elaborate experiments were performed to demonstrate the
   applicability of PVDF sensors towards catheter based biomedical
   application. The resonant frequency of the PVDF sensor was found to be
   6.34 MHz. The PVDF sensors can operate over a broad pressure range of
   0-300 mmHg. The average sensitivity of the PVDF sensor was found to be
   four times higher (99 mu V/mmHg) than commercial pressure sensor while
   the PVDF sensor (0.26 s) had fivefold shorter response time than
   commercial pressure sensor (1.30 s), making the PVDF sensors highly
   suitable for real-time pressure measurements using catheters.}},

Abstract = {{Both varied and strong promoters are essential for metabolic and pathway
   engineering applications in any host organism. To enable this capacity,
   here we demonstrate a generalizable method for the de novo construction
   of strong, synthetic hybrid promoter libraries. Specifically, we
   demonstrate how promoter truncation and fragment dissection analysis can
   be utilized to identify both novel upstream activating sequences (UAS)
   and core promoters-the two components required to generate hybrid
   promoters. As a base case, the native TEF promoter in Yarrowia
   lipolytica was examined to identify putative UAS elements that serve as
   modular synthetic transcriptional activators. Resulting synthetic
   promoters containing a core promoter region activated by between one and
   twelve tandem repeats of the newly isolated, 230 nucleotide UAS(TEF)\#2
   element showed promoter strengths 3- to 4.5-fold times the native TEF
   promoter. Further analysis through transcription factor binding site
   abrogation revealed the GCR1p binding site to be necessary for complete
   UAS(TEF)\#2 function. These various promoters were tested for function
   in a variety of carbon sources. Finally, by combining disparate UAS
   elements (in this case, UAS(TEF) and UAS1B), we developed a
   high-strength promoter with for Y. lipolytica with an expression level
   of nearly sevenfold higher than that of the strong, constitutive TEF
   promoter. Thus, the general strategy described here enables the
   efficient, de novo construction of synthetic promoters to both increase
   native expression capacity and to produce libraries for tunable gene
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{Gold nanorods can be internalized by macrophages (an important early
   cellular marker in atherosclerosis and cancer) and used as an imaging
   contrast agent for macrophage targeting. Objective of this study is to
   compare two-photon luminescence (TPL) properties of four aspect ratios
   of gold nanorods with surface plasmon resonance at 700, 756, 844 and
   1060 nm respectively. TPL from single nanorods and Rhodamine 6G
   particles was measured using a laser-scanning TPL microscope. Nanorod
   TPL emission spectrum was recorded by a spectrometer. Quadratic
   dependence of luminescence intensity on excitation power (confirming a
   TPL process) was observed below a threshold (e. g., <1.6 mW), followed
   by photobleaching at higher power levels. Dependence of nanorod TPL
   intensity on excitation wavelength indicated that the two-photon action
   cross section (TPACS) is plasmon-enhanced. Largest TPACS of a single
   nanorod (12271 GM) was substantially larger than a single Rhodamine 6G
   particle (25 GM) at 760 nm excitation. Characteristics of nanorod TPL
   emission spectrum can be explained by plasmon-enhanced interband
   transition of gold. Comparison results of TPL brightness, TPACS and
   emission spectrum of nanorods can guide selection of optimal contrast
   agent for selected imaging applications. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Reliable feature extraction, condition monitoring, and fault modeling
   are critical to understanding equipment degradation and implementing the
   proper maintenance decisions in manufacturing processes. Semiconductor
   manufacturing machines are highly sophisticated systems, consisting of
   multiple interacting components operating in highly variable operating
   conditions. This complicates performance monitoring since equipment
   condition must often be inferred through concurrent interpretation of
   multiple sensor readings originating from potentially very different
   subsystems of the tool. This paper presents an integrated approach to
   feature extraction, condition monitoring, and fault modeling applied to
   a set of standard built-in sensors on a modern 300-mm technology
   industrial Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) tool.
   Linear Discriminant Analysis was utilized to determine the set of
   dynamic features that are the most sensitive to different tool
   conditions brought about by chamber cleaning or various faults. Gaussian
   Mixture Models of the dynamic feature distributions were used to
   statistically quantify changes of these features as the condition of the
   tool changed. In addition, four highly detrimental faults were analyzed
   to demonstrate the fault modeling methodology. Data collected over 8
   months from a PECVD tool being operated by a major microelectronics
   manufacturer was used to verify the methodology. Top sensitive features
   from various faults observed in this period were examined and physical
   connections to the chamber condition were interpreted through their
   behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although dielectrophoresis (DEP) has great potential for addressing
   clinical cell isolation problems based on cell dielectric differences, a
   biological basis for predicting the DEP behavior of cells has been
   lacking. Here, the dielectric properties of the NCI-60 panel of tumor
   cell types have been measured by dielectrophoretic (DEP) field-flow
   fractionation, correlated with the exterior morphologies of the cells
   during growth, and compared with the dielectric and morphological
   characteristics of the subpopulations of peripheral blood. In agreement
   with earlier findings, cell total capacitance varied with both cell size
   and plasma membrane folding and the dielectric properties of the NCI-60
   cell types in suspension reflected the plasma membrane area and volume
   of the cells at their growth sites. Therefore, the behavior of cells in
   DEP-based manipulations is largely determined by their exterior
   morphological characteristics prior to release into suspension. As a
   consequence, DEP is able to discriminate between cells of similar size
   having different morphological origins, offering a significant advantage
   over size-based filtering for isolating circulating tumor cells, for
   example. The findings provide a framework for anticipating cell
   dielectric behavior on the basis of structurefunction relationships and
   suggest that DEP should be widely applicable as a surface
   marker-independent method for sorting cells.}},

Abstract = {{The first geosynthetic retaining wall in Brazil was constructed in 1984
   as an instrumented 10 m high geotextile-reinforced soil wall with a
   poorly draining backfill. This structure has been showing excellent
   performance throughout its service life, even after long periods of
   rainfall. In the past, the excellent performance of the wall had been
   attributed to the influence of soil confinement on the geotextile
   strength properties as well as the comparatively high interface shear
   strength between the fine soil and the nonwoven geotextile. Now there is
   also evidence of the beneficial effect of the internal drainage capacity
   when using nonwoven geotextiles as reinforcements. In order to clarify
   the understanding of the performance of the pioneer history case wall
   (SP-123 wall) and the effect of nonwoven geotextiles as reinforcements
   of fine-grained soils, full-scale laboratory models of geotextile
   reinforced walls were tested under wetting conditions. Results from the
   instrumentation have shown no significant positive water pressures and
   relatively small displacements even after intense periods of
   precipitation. The consistency between field and laboratory
   investigations provides strong evidence in support of the use of
   nonwoven geotextiles to reinforce poorly draining soils.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simple but accurate model is presented to analyze
   source/drain (S/D) series resistance in trigate fin field-effect
   transistors, particularly on triangular or pentagonal rather than
   rectangular epitaxy. The model includes the contribution of spreading,
   sheet, and contact resistances. Although the spreading and sheet
   resistances are evaluated modifying standard models, the contact
   resistance is newly modeled using equivalent models of lossy
   transmission lines and transformations of 3-D to 2-D geometry. Compared
   with series resistance extracted from 3-D numerical simulations, the
   model shows excellent agreement, even when the S/D geometry, silicide
   contact resistivity, and S/D doping concentration are varied. We find
   that the series resistance is influenced more by contact surface area
   than by carrier path from the S/D extension to the silicide contact. To
   meet the series resistance targeted in the semiconductor roadmap, both
   materials and geometry will need to be optimized, i.e., lowering the
   silicide contact resistivity and keeping high doping concentration as
   well as maximizing the contact surface area, respectively.}},

Title = {{Identification of the Composite Relaxation Modulus of Asphalt Binder

Abstract = {{The use of nanoindentation to study asphalt is aimed at understanding
   the relationship between properties of asphalt binder at various length
   scales. A combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and
   nanoindentation is used to determine the relaxation moduli of bimodal
   and trimodal distributions of asphalt microphases to assess differences
   between macroscale and composite nanoscale viscoelastic behavior. The
   relaxation modulus values extracted from age-altered phases of the same
   asphalts provide important relationships between microstructural changes
   depicted in AFM images and changes in composite viscoelastic properties
   obtained from the measurements. This paper provides key information
   regarding asphalt microrheology, which will yield improved input values
   for asphalt prediction models and enhanced pavement performance. Based
   on comparison of the composite viscoelastic properties obtained from
   this study to values obtained at larger length scales, it is apparent
   that relaxation modulus values decrease as the length scale increases.
   This finding serves as the basis for ongoing studies by the authors and
   other researchers in the areas of asphalt nanomodification, chemical
   mapping, and modeling of nanodamage using AFM. DOI:

Abstract = {{Radioargon has been identified as a useful nuclide for verifying
   compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Use of Ar-37
   to identify a nuclear explosion requires quantification of contributions
   to the Ar-37 background at a potential measurement site. A method of
   estimating Ar-37 release activities using isotopes of radioxenon and
   radioargon has been developed in this paper. Numerical solutions to the
   system of equations describing air-activation in a reactor were used to
   determine ratios of release activities for Xe-135/Xe-133,
   Xe-133m/Xe-131m, and Ar-37 /Ar-41 as function of irradiation time and
   off-gas residence time prior to measurement and release. Published
   radioactive noble gas effluent data for the High Flux Isotope Reactor,
   HFIR (ORNL) from the year 1996 to 2010 were compiled as a test data set
   to predict the Ar-37 release on a yearly basis. An average Ar-37 release
   rate of 1.86 x 10(10) Bq per year was calculated. The estimated release
   rate was used as a source term for atmospheric transport to run a test
   case for Ar-37 release over a typical HFIR operation cycle. Results
   showed that ground-level concentrations of Ar-37 did not exceed the
   minimum detectable concentration for a Ar-37 field measurement system
   beyond the immediate vicinity of the release point.}},

Abstract = {{Neutron activation analysis of plant samples for trace amounts of nickel
   has applications in various fields. Landsberger and Robinson (Trans Am
   Nucl Soc 102:187-188, 2010) found their measurement of the
   concentrations of nickel for different NIST reference materials to be
   significantly greater than the certified values when measuring nickel
   from the 810.8 keV gamma ray that comes from Co-58 from the Ni-58(n,p)
   reaction. They determined that this overestimation was due to a
   significant interference by the presence of Eu-152 at 810.5 keV, and
   presented a method for correcting this interference. Their method
   involved a long thermal irradiation and correction of gamma ray counts
   based on the 1,408 keV belonging to Eu-152. This paper presents an
   alternative approach, which involves irradiating the samples with
   epithermal neutrons, which suppressed the Eu-152 to the point of being
   negligible for samples with low levels of europium. Both methods were
   determined to work well for the identification of nickel concentrations
   by neutron activation analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Samples from a potentially contaminated industrial area were analyzed
   for uranium using neutron activation analysis (NAA). Uranium
   concentration values had a typical uncertainty of 2 \% and a detection
   limit of 1 Bq/kg. To investigate the potential leaching dynamics into
   ground water two techniques were employed. The US EPA Toxicity
   Characterization Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and the Sequential Extraction
   Procedure (SEP) were used to determine the concentration of uranium in
   the leachates. TCLP and SEP showed that very little of the uranium
   leached into solution under different chemical conditions. Values of
   uranium leachates ranged from 0.05 to 3.5 Bq/L; a concentration much
   lower than the results found in the soil concentrations which ranged
   from 29 to 155 Bq/kg. NAA showed an 8 \% uncertainty for leachates with
   a detection limit of 0.13 Bq/L. To mimic environmental conditions and
   acid rain, pH 4.3 water was used as the extraction solvent instead of
   the acetic acid routinely used in TCLP. Results confirmed that very low
   amounts of uranium leached with values ranging from 0.0002 to 0.0122
   Bq/L. These values represent 0.01-1 \% of the uranium in the soil
   samples. The distribution of uranium in soil according to particle size
   was also investigated to evaluate its potential movement and possible
   contamination of the water table. Particles below 250 mu m in diameter
   showed a linear increase in uranium concentration whereas those with a
   larger diameter had constant uranium content.}},

Abstract = {{The radioactivity of the U-235,U- 238 and Th-232 isotope decay chains
   for geological samples can usually be assumed to be in equilibrium due
   to their age. Similarly, one can assume that the isotopic mass
   proportions are equal to natural isotopic abundance. Current methods
   used to ascertain activity in these decay chains involve alpha particle
   spectrometry, ICP-MS or passive gamma-ray spectrometry, all of which can
   be laborious and time consuming. In this research, we have used thermal
   and epithermal neutron activation analysis (NAA) of small sample sizes
   of various geological materials in order to ascertain these activities.
   By using NAA, we aim to obviate cumbersome sample preparation, the need
   for large samples and extended counting time. In addition to the decay
   chains of uranium and thorium, K-40 was also determined using epithermal
   neutron activation analysis to determine total potassium content and
   then subtracting out its isotopic contribution.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known variations in neutron fluxes can adversely affect the
   final result in neutron activation analysis. The monitoring of neutron
   flux changes are usually described for medium and long-lived NAA using
   foils of cobalt, gold, zirconium, etc. However, for short-lived neutron
   activation analysis there appears to be no systematic study of the
   variations of the neutron flux. With our new automatic pneumatic system,
   where irradiation timing, decay and counting and position are very
   reproducible, we have performed a series of experiments using thermal
   and epithermal neutrons using aluminum wire as a monitor to monitor the
   neutron fluxes. Our experiments confirm that neutron flux fluctuations
   in the worst case can be up to +/- 12 \% with a SD of 2-3 \%. This
   effect can be seen regardless of the irradiation time and must be taken
   into consideration to achieve the best result.}},

   National Nuclear Security Administration. As with our previous
   three-year Nuclear Forensics Education Award Program we will continue to
   offer a comprehensive educational program and closely collaborate with
   national laboratories to pursue common research. Our research will
   primarily focus on analysis of radioactive debris following a nuclear or
   radiological dispersive device event or the investigation of the
   pedigree of nuclear materials in nonproliferation. This research will
   include using Compton suppression and gamma coincidence low-level gamma
   ray counting, investigation of nuclear fuel cycles for nonproliferation,
   on-site inspection within the context of the Comprehensive
   Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and radioxenon detection physics. We also offer
   a graduate program in nuclear robotics, an interdisciplinary program in
   the automation of handling special nuclear materials. To better equip
   our students who are entering the workforce at the national laboratories
   and government agencies we are also proposing the development of several
   new laboratory modules for non-destructive identification of fission

Abstract = {{The determination of Zn in geological samples using instrumental neutron
   activation analysis is usually done using the Zn-64(n,gamma)Zn-65
   reaction and its 244 day half-life. However this analysis has proven to
   be potentially difficult. This is due to its relatively low neutron
   absorption cross section and gamma ray intensity, and the relatively
   high neutron absorption cross section and gamma intensity of Sc-46,
   which has an energy peak that is only 5 keV greater than Zn-65. The use
   of a high resolution detector makes it possible to differentiate between
   the Zn-65 and Sc-46 photopeaks peaks. However, the dominating Sc-46
   gamma ray can even make peak fitting routines unsuccessful in the proper
   determination of Zn-65. The use of a Compton suppression system
   suppresses the Sc-46 peak, which has two coincident gamma-rays, and this
   greatly improves the ratio of the height of the Sc-46 1120.5 keV
   photopeak to the Zn-65 1115.4 keV photopeak. Irradiating the sample with
   epithermal neutrons also improves the measurement since Zn-65 has a
   higher cross section for epithermal neutrons rather than thermal
   neutrons, whereas Sc-46 has a higher thermal cross section. Another
   technique to determine zinc is the use of Zn-68(n,gamma)Zn-69m reaction
   with its 13 h half-life using epithermal neutrons and Compton
   suppression INAA. However, the 438 keV gamma ray of Zn-69m has no
   interference with any adjoining photopeak. A critical comparison of
   these two methods is given.}},

Abstract = {{Though gold nanoparticles have been considered bio-inert, recent studies
   have questioned their safety. To reduce the potential for toxicity, we
   developed a nanoclustering of gold and iron oxide as a nanoparticle
   (nanorose) which biodegrades into subunits to facilitate rapid
   excretion. In this present study, we demonstrate acid and macrophage
   lysosomal degradation of nanorose via loss of the near-infrared optical
   shift, and clearance of the nanorose in vivo following i.v.
   administration in C57BL/6 mice by showing gold concentration is
   significantly reduced in 11 murine tissues in as little as 31 days (P <
   0.01). Hematology and chemistry show no toxicity of nanorose injected
   mice up to 14 days after administration. We conclude that the clustering
   design of nanorose does enhance the excretion of these nanoparticles,
   and that this could be a viable strategy to limit the potential toxicity
   of gold nanoparticles for clinical applications.
   From the Clinical Editor: The potential toxicity of nanomaterials is a
   critically important limiting factor in their more widespread clinical
   application. Gold nanoparticles have been classically considered
   bio-inert, but recent studies have questioned their safety. The authors
   of this study have developed a clustering gold and iron oxide
   nanoparticle (nanorose), which biodegrades into subunits to facilitate
   rapid excretion, resulting in reduced toxicity. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper studies a multiple-recipe predictive maintenance problem with
   M/G/1 queueing effects. The server degrades according to a discrete-time
   Markov chain and we assume that the controller knows both the machine
   status and the current number of jobs in the system. The controller's
   objective is to minimize total discounted costs or long-run average
   costs which include preventative and corrective maintenance costs,
   holdings costs, and possibly production costs. An optimal policy
   determines both when to perform maintenance and which type of job to
   process. Since the policy takes into account the machine's degradation
   status, such control decisions are known as predictive maintenance
   policies. In the single-recipe case, we prove that the optimal policy is
   monotone in the machine status, but not in the number of jobs in the
   system. A similar monotonicity result holds in the two-recipe case.
   Finally, we provide computational results indicating that significant
   savings can be realized when implementing a predictive maintenance
   policies instead of a traditional job-based threshold policy for
   preventive maintenances.}},

Abstract = {{A newly discovered 1:3 A-site-ordered AA'3B4O12 perovskite oxide
   CaCu3Ir4O12 which has unusual electrical and magnetic properties was

   iso-structural oxides of CaCu3Ru4O12 and CaCu3Ti4O12 with dissimilar
   physical properties. It has been found by STEM HAADF imaging that Ca and
   Cu on A and A' sites are ordered as expected. Oxygen atoms are imaged
   with STEM ABF imaging. The fine structures of the Cu L-2,L-3 core loss
   and O-K edges show that the electronic structure of CaCu3Ir4O12 is very
   close to that of CaCu3Ru4O12, but different from CaCu3Ti4O12. The O-K
   near edge fine structures show extensive hybridization of Ir 5d and O 2p
   band. Cu L-2,L-3 peaks indicate Cu in CaCu3Ir4O12 has 2+ valence, though
   Cu2+ electrons mainly localized, they might have strong interactions
   with Ir4+ 5d electrons through Ir-O-Cu, similar to the strong coupling

Abstract = {{Protein kinases, which play an important role in the regulation of the
   majority of cellular processes, especially those involved in cellular
   signal transduction, by catalyzing the phosphorylation of specific
   proteins, are the attractive targets of drug design in pharmaceuticals
   industry. Interestingly, up to 10\% of proteins in the human kinome
   termed pseudokinases are predicted to be enzymatically inactive, but are
   still pivotal in regulating diverse cellular processes and thus may be a
   potential therapeutic target to a certain extent. To study the
   underlying molecular mechanisms, molecular dynamics simulations were
   performed to investigate the role of bivalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ in
   the structural stabilities and dynamical behaviors of vaccinia related
   kinase 3 (VRK3), which was the first solved crystal structure of the
   pseudokinase, and that of its closest active relatives VRK1 and VRK2.
   Toward this end, a series of molecular dynamics simulations have been
   performed with different divalent cations binding modes in the active
   site. The simulations suggested that the binding of Mg2+ in the active
   site played a key structural role in the stabilization of VRK1 and VRK2,
   and Mn2+ was slightly required for VRK2. By contrast, the pseudokinase
   VRK3 was well ordered with lower RMSD values indicating it was rigid and
   very stable regardless of whether the bivalent cations were bound or not
   during the simulations. The present study provided evidence for the role
   of bivalent cations in structural stabilities of VRKs and the proposed
   simulation model reconciled the interpretation of available experimental
   structural and thermal denaturation assay data. These results gave us
   further information on the dynamical behaviors of the active site of
   VRKs and suggested a mechanism of regulation of their structural
   stabilities, and might provide a starting point for the more detailed
   follow-up investigation of drug design.}},

Abstract = {{DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins), new kinds of binding
   proteins, have the potential to overcome the defects of monoclonal
   antibodies, and hence may become the alternatives to antibodies and
   generate a novel therapeutic approach. DARPins can be selected to bind
   any given target proteins with high affinity and specificity. In the
   process of binding to target proteins, the reason why DARPins have high
   affinity to target proteins as well as the correlation among sequences,
   structures, dynamical behaviors and binding to target proteins are still
   unknown. This paper studied DARPins using the AMBER package with ff03
   force field for molecular dynamics simulations, providing a theoretical
   basis for the research on a new type of protein drug. This shows that
   the DARPins have more dynamical behaviors regularity after binding to
   target proteins compared with non-binding DARPins, but the binding to
   target proteins does not always stabilize the structures of DARPins, and
   the changes in the regions of beta-turn and loop are the most obvious.
   The changes in hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions have close
   relationship with the changes in the stability and cross correlation of
   DARPins.}},

Abstract = {{Replication is the prevalent solution to tolerate faults in large data
   structures hosted on distributed servers. To tolerate f crash faults
   (dead/unresponsive data structures) among n distinct data structures,
   replication requires f + 1 replicas of each data structure, resulting in
   nf additional backups. We present a solution, referred to as fusion that
   uses a combination of erasure codes and selective replication to
   tolerate f crash faults using just f additional fused backups. We show
   that our solution achieves O(n) savings in space over replication.
   Further, we present a solution to tolerate f Byzantine faults (malicious
   data structures), that requires only nf + f backups as compared to the
   2nf backups required by replication. We explore the theory of fused
   backups and provide a library of such backups for all the data
   structures in the Java Collection Framework. The theoretical and
   experimental evaluation confirms that the fused backups are
   space-efficient as compared to replication, while they cause very little
   overhead for normal operation. To illustrate the practical usefulness of
   fusion, we use fused backups for reliability in Amazon's highly
   available key-value store, Dynamo. While the current replication-based
   solution uses 300 backup structures, we present a solution that only
   requires 120 backup structures. This results in savings in space as well
   as other resources such as power.}},

Abstract = {{Building from considerable empirical research in the general business
   literature, this paper quantitatively explores the view that the
   benefits of information technologies manifest themselves through
   improvement in work processes. In turn, better work processes lead to
   increased project performance. Using an overall sample of 133 projects (
   missing data make specific correlation sample sizes smaller) from the
   Construction Industry Institute Benchmarking and Metrics database, this
   paper analyzes correlations between technology use and integration, best
   practices, and project performance measured with cost, schedule, and
   rework metrics. Data are also used to assess the complementary
   interaction between technology use, work processes as measured by best
   practices, and performance. The findings show that there are limited
   significant beneficial correlations between information technology use
   and performance, slightly more significant beneficial correlations
   between best practice use and performance, and several significant
   correlations between information technology use and application of Best
   practices. Interaction effects of the combined use of information
   technologies and best practices against performance are assessed,
   finding several positive correlations, although limited data
   availability prevents robust statistical evaluation. Overall, the paper
   concludes there is evidence that the benefits of information
   technologies in construction are found through changes in work
   processes. This paper thus challenges more common approaches that
   attempt to directly correlate the impact of information technology use
   on project performance with corresponding implications for both academic
   and industrial attempts at assessment. DOI:

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to compare the pollutant removal
   effectiveness of biofiltration systems containing different media and
   plant species. A laboratory column study was conducted by using three
   media and two plant species, each with and without a submerged zone
   intended to promote denitrification. Twenty experiments were run by
   using synthetic storm water over the course of nine months, and ten of
   them were analyzed. The three media used were concrete sand, masonry
   sand, and a medium that meets the City of Austin's biofiltration
   specifications. The plant species were Buffalograss 609 and Big Muhly,
   both commonly found in Texas. The results of this study showed a
   significant improvement in nutrient removal with the presence of these
   plants in the filter. The columns without plants were found to export
   substantial amounts of nitrate/nitrite, whereas the columns with the
   plants demonstrated a substantial removal of nutrients (59-79\% of the
   total nitrogen and 77-94\% of the total phosphorus). Solids removal
   remained high through the entire set of experiments for all columns
   (88-97\%). Hydraulic conductivity experienced an initial rapid decrease
   in all columns but then stabilized. DOI:

Abstract = {{When designing wastewater aeration systems, fine-pore diffusers are
   typically selected for their potential energy efficiency. Because
   aeration is one of the most energy-intensive unit operations during
   treatment, the accurate quantification of aeration performance
   parameters is crucial to minimize the process energy footprint. Oxygen
   transfer efficiency in process water is the key design parameter;
   however, performance indicators that account for fouling and increased
   pressure drop with time must be considered. Both fouling and pressure
   drop increase cause an increase in blower power requirements. This paper
   presents a new approach to improve this design procedure, without
   altering the technical structure of the classical approach. Although the
   administrative and bidding milestones are underway (i.e., in the first
   few months of the project), an independent aeration team can test
   candidate diffusers suitable for design in an in situ aeration column.
   Subsequently, an extended fouling test in the plant's wastewater can be
   carried out within the design timing, providing the designers with
   site-specific aeration performance data. This methodology improves the
   accuracy of the design process and increases overall energy savings.

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites prepared by the dispersion of unmodified and organically
   modified montmorillonite (MMT) clay into poly(2,6-dimethyl phenylene
   oxide)/polystyrene miscible blend in the range of 2-10 wt\% clay were
   investigated by wide-angle x-ray diffraction, transmission electron
   microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric
   analysis and tensile mechanical tests. The systems based on unmodified
   sodium MMT (Na+MMT) as well as Cloisite 20A, Cloisite 30B and Cloisite
   10A organically modified clays showed polymer intercalation. The glass
   transition temperature (T-g) value was not affected by the volume
   fraction of clay and chemical nature of the organoclay. The thermal
   degradation stability of nanocomposites is found to be only slightly
   better than that of the blend matrix. A percolation threshold of around
   4 wt\% organoclay loading is observed. An improvement of 35\% relative
   to unfilled polymer blend matrix is observed for the modulus, for
   Cloisite 20A nanocomposite containing 2 wt\% organoclay. The observed
   modulus improvement with significant retention of elongational tensile
   strength and tensile ductility in case of unmodified Na-MMT and Cloisite
   30B nanocomposites appears promising. The modulus prediction using
   Halpin-Tsai model is found to be closer to the experimental data when
   MMT volume fraction rather than the organoclay volume fraction is used.}},

Abstract = {{Using a thin-layer method enhanced by continued-fraction absorbing
   boundary conditions, dynamic responses of a layered half-space subjected

   is formulated for plane-strain as well as antiplane-shear conditions and
   is verified by comparison of computed responses of a homogeneous
   half-space subjected to a single constant load on its surface against
   available analytical solutions. Next, time-harmonic loads on a
   homogeneous half-space are examined. The study continues with both
   constant and time-harmonic loads on a layered half-space. Finally,
   multiple constant and time-harmonic loads are considered. The
   formulation and results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
   the method in problems of dynamic response of layered media to moving

Abstract = {{We discuss recent progress in the full-waveform-based imaging of probed
   soils, with geotechnical site characterization applications in mind. The
   primary goal is the reconstruction of the material profile of
   near-surface, arbitrarily heterogeneous formations, in terms of the
   formation's spatially distributed elastic properties, using elastic
   waves as the probing agent.
   We describe first the formulation and numerical resolution of the
   underlying time-dependent inverse medium problem; we report briefly on
   numerical experiments using synthetic data and artificial target soil
   profiles. These demonstrate robust reconstruction. We then report
   extensively on the details of a field experiment, whose records we
   subsequently used to drive the inversion algorithms in order to
   characterize the site where the field experiment took place. Lastly, we
   compare the inverted site profile with profiles obtained using the
   Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) method, in an attempt to
   compare our methodology against a widely used concurrent inversion
   approach. We also compare the inverted profile at select locations with
   the results of independently performed CPT tests.
   Overall, whether exercised by synthetic or by physical data, the full
   waveform inversion method we discuss herein appears quite promising for
   the robust subsurface imaging of near-surface deposits in support of
   geotechnical site characterization investigations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Freezing of protein solutions perturbs protein conformation, potentially
   leading to aggregate formation during long-term storage in the frozen
   state. Macroscopic protein concentration profiles in small cylindrical
   vessels were determined for a monoclonal antibody frozen in a
   trehalose-based formulation for various freezing protocols. Slow cooling
   rates led to concentration differences between outer edges of the tank
   and the center, up to twice the initial concentration. Fast cooling
   rates resulted in much smaller differences in protein distribution,
   likely due to the formation of dendritic ice, which traps solutes in
   micropockets, limiting their transport by convection and diffusion.
   Analysis of protein stability after more than 6 months storage at either
   10 degrees C or 20 degrees C {[}above glass transition temperature (Tg)]
   or 80 degrees C (below Tg) revealed that aggregation correlated with the
   cooling rate. Slow-cooled vessels stored above Tg exhibited increased
   aggregation with time. In contrast, fast-cooled vessels and those stored
   below Tg showed small to no increase in aggregation at any position.
   Rapid entrapment of protein in a solute matrix by fast freezing results
   in improved stability even when stored above Tg. (c) 2013 Wiley

   this process are highlighted so that they may facilitate new

Abstract = {{An atomically detailed potential for docking pairs of proteins is
   derived using mathematical programming. A refinement algorithm that
   builds atomically detailed models of the complex and combines coarse
   grained and atomic scoring is introduced. The refinement step consists
   of remodeling the interface side chains of the top scoring decoys from
   rigid docking followed by a short energy minimization. The refined
   models are then re-ranked using a combination of coarse grained and
   atomic potentials. The docking algorithm including the refinement and
   re-ranking, is compared favorably to other leading docking packages like
   ZDOCK, Cluspro, and PATCHDOCK, on the ZLAB 3.0 Benchmark and a test set
   of 30 novel complexes. A detailed analysis shows that coarse grained
   potentials perform better than atomic potentials for realistic unbound
   docking (where the exact structures of the individual bound proteins are
   unknown), probably because atomic potentials are more sensitive to local
   errors. Nevertheless, the atomic potential captures a different signal
   from the residue potential and as a result a combination of the two
   scores provides a significantly better prediction than each of the
   approaches alone. Proteins 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Gas transport properties of PIM-1, i.e., the first ``polymer with
   intrinsic microporosity,{''} at 25 degrees C and different pressures
   were systematically studied. Permeability coefficients of 10 gases
   including He, H-2, N-2, O-2, CH4, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8 were
   conducted at 25 degrees C for five different upstream pressures (from 1
   to 10 atm). The C-2 and C-3 hydrocarbons exhibited serious
   plasticization responses while the permeability coefficients of He, H-2,
   O-2, N-2, CH4 and CO2 decreased with the trans-membrane pressure as
   expected from the dual-mobility model. Sorption isotherms of all 10
   gases were also determined using a dual-volume sorption cell at 25
   degrees C up to a maximum pressure of 27 atm. The sorption isotherms
   followed the dual-mode sorption model. The logarithm of the solubility
   coefficients increased linearly with the critical temperature of the gas
   and the slope of this plot (0.018) was found to be comparable with
   values reported for other glassy polymers. Diffusion coefficients were
   calculated from the permeability and solubility data; the values for He,
   H-2, O-2, N-2, CH4 and CO2, increased with pressure as predicted by the
   dual-mobility model while those of the C-2 and C-3 hydrocarbon gases
   increased more strongly because of plasticization. Parameters from the
   dual mobility model, DD and DH, were significantly higher and their
   ratio, DH/DD was significantly smaller than those of previously reported
   polymers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the feasibility of active clamping techniques in
   isolated time-sharing (TS) multiple-input converters (MICs). Additional
   losses caused by energy transfer from the leakage inductance in the
   isolating coupled-inductor into the input switches are addressed with a
   common active clamping leg for all input legs. An active clamping
   technique is applied to isolated TS-MIC to minimize the additional
   switching losses and voltage stresses on input legs. This paper also
   conducts an operational analysis of an isolated time-sharing dual-input
   single-ended primary-inductor converter (I-TS-DI-SEPIC) with the
   discussed active clamping technique. Zero-voltage switching can be
   achieved on the first-turned-on input leg and the active clamping leg
   with a proper driving strategy and well-chosen circuit parameter
   settings. Discussions on the effect of the active clamping technique to
   an MIC and the components stresses of the I-TS-DI-SEPIC with the active
   clamping technique have also been made to assist in the design of
   TS-MICs. Prototypes of the I-TS-DI-SEPIC with the active clamping
   technique have been built to demonstrate the performance in the
   application of split-phase dc distribution systems. Converter efficiency

Title = {{Probabilistic strain optimization under constraint uncertainty}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: An important step in strain optimization is to identify
   reactions whose activities should be modified to achieve the desired
   cellular objective. Preferably, these reactions are identified
   systematically, as the number of possible combinations of reaction
   modifications could be very large. Over the last several years, a number
   of computational methods have been described for identifying
   combinations of reaction modifications. However, none of these methods
   explicitly address uncertainties in implementing the reaction activity
   modifications. In this work, we model the uncertainties as probability
   distributions in the flux carrying capacities of reactions. Based on
   this model, we develop an optimization method that identifies reactions
   for flux capacity modifications to predict outcomes with high
   statistical likelihood.
   Results: We compare three optimization methods that select an
   intervention set comprising up- or down-regulation of reaction flux
   capacity: CCOpt (Chance constrained optimization), DetOpt (Deterministic
   optimization), and MCOpt (Monte Carlo-based optimization). We evaluate
   the methods using a Monte Carlo simulation-based method, MCEval (Monte
   Carlo Evaluations). We present two case studies analyzing a CHO cell and
   an adipocyte model. The flux capacity distributions required for our
   methods were estimated from maximal reaction velocities or elementary
   mode analysis. The intervention set selected by CCOpt consistently
   outperforms the intervention set selected by DetOpt in terms of
   tolerance to flux capacity variations. MCEval shows that the optimal
   flux predicted based on the CCOpt intervention set is more likely to be
   obtained, in a probabilistic sense, than the flux predicted by DetOpt.
   The intervention sets identified by CCOpt and MCOpt were similar;
   however, the exhaustive sampling required by MCOpt incurred
   significantly greater computational cost.
   Conclusions: Maximizing tolerance to variable engineering outcomes (in
   modifying enzyme activities) can identify intervention sets that
   statistically improve the desired cellular objective.}},

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{9-18}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Crash statistics suggest that horizontal curves are the most vulnerable
   sites for crash occurrence. These crashes are often severe and many
   involve at least some level of injury due to the nature of the
   collisions. Ensuring the desired pavement surface condition is one
   potentially effective strategy to reduce the occurrence of severe
   accidents on horizontal curves. This study sought to develop crash
   injury severity models by integrating crash and pavement surface
   condition databases. It focuses on developing a causal relationship
   between pavement condition indices and severity level of crashes
   occurring on two-lane horizontal curves in Texas. In addition, it
   examines the suitability of the existing Skid Index for safety
   maintenance of two-lane curves. Significant correlation is evident
   between pavement condition and crash injury severity on two-lane
   undivided horizontal curves in Texas. Probability of a crash becoming
   fatal is appreciably sensitive to certain pavement indices. Data
   suggested that road facilities providing a smoother and more comfortable
   ride are vulnerable to severe crashes on horizontal curves. In addition,
   the study found that longitudinal skid measurement barely correlates
   with injury severity of crashes occurring on curved portions. The study
   recommends exploring the option of incorporating lateral friction
   measurement into Pavement Management System (PMS) databases specifically
   at curved road segments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   results from our analysis underscore the value of our proposed model for
   data fit purposes as well as to accurately estimate variable effects.
   The most important determinants of injury severity on highways,
   according to our results, are (1) whether any vehicle occupant is
   ejected, (2) whether collision type is head-on, (3) whether any vehicle
   involved in the crash overturned, (4) whether any vehicle occupant is
   unrestrained by a seat-belt, and (5) whether a commercial truck is
   involved. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of neutron-induced damage on the ferroelectric properties of
   thin film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) were investigated. Two sets of
   PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 films of varying initial quality were irradiated in a
   research nuclear reactor up to a maximum 1 MeV equivalent neutron
   fluence of (5.16 +/- 0.03) x 10(15)cm(-2). Changes in domain wall
   mobility and reversibility were characterized by polarization-electric
   field measurements, Rayleigh analysis, and analysis of first order
   reversal curves (FORC). With increasing fluence, extrinsic contributions
   to the small-signal permittivity diminished. Additionally,
   redistribution of irreversible hysterons towards higher coercive fields
   was observed accompanied by the formation of a secondary hysteron peak
   following exposure to high fluence levels. The changes are attributed to
   the radiation-induced formation of defect dipoles and other charged
   defects, which serve as effective domain wall pinning sites. Differences
   in damage accumulation rates with initial film quality were observed
   between the film sets suggesting a dominance of pre-irradiation
   microstructure on changes in macroscopic switching behavior. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We examine the interactions and interdependencies between Neuroglia, the
   Brain-Cell Microenvironment, and the processes commonly subsumed under
   Neuromodulation. The interactions of the component processes covering a
   wide spectrum of frequencies are designated as Neuromodulatory Systems
   (NMS). This implies NMS's scale-invariance as the capacity of linking
   actions across many time scales, and self-similarity at any scale. These
   features endow NMS with the ability to respond adaptively to neural
   impulse traffic of an unpredictably wide frequency spectrum. In this
   preliminary perspective, the components of NMS are only outlined based
   on concepts of Complex Systems Dynamics. However, their interactions
   must be formally elaborated in further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{RNAs form complex secondary and three-dimensional structures, and their
   biological functions highly rely on their structures and dynamics. Here
   we developed a general coarse-grained framework for RNA 3D structure
   prediction. A new, hybrid coarse-grained model that explicitly describes
   the electrostatics and hydrogen-bond interactions has been constructed
   based on experimental structural statistics. With the simulated
   annealing simulation protocol, several RNAs of less than 30-nt were
   folded to within 4.0 A of the native structures. In addition, with
   limited restraints on Watson-Crick basepairing based on the data from
   NMR spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) information,
   the current model was able to characterize the complex tertiary
   structures of large size RNAs, such as SS ribosome and U2/U6 snRNA. We
   also demonstrated that the pseudoknot structure was better captured when
   the coordinating Mg2+ cations and limited basepairing restraints were
   included. The accuracy of our model has been compared favorably with
   other RNA structure prediction methods presented in the previous study
   of RNA-Puzzles. Therefore the coarse-grained model presented here offers
   a unique approach for accurate prediction and modeling of RNA
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-based electrodes have been widely tested and used in
   electrochemical double layer capacitors due to their high surface area
   and electrical conductivity. Nitrogen doping of graphene has recently
   been demonstrated to significantly enhance capacitance, but the
   underlying mechanisms remain ambiguous. We present the doping effect on
   the interfacial capacitance between graphene and {[}BMIM]{[}PF6] ionic
   liquid, particularly the relative changes in the double layer and
   electrode (quantum) capacitances. The electrode capacitance change was
   evaluated based on density functional theory calculations of
   doping-induced electronic structure modifications in graphene, while the
   microstructure and capacitance of the double layers forming near
   undoped/doped graphene electrodes were calculated using classical
   molecular dynamics. Our computational study clearly demonstrates that
   nitrogen doping can lead to significant enhancement in the electrode
   capacitance as a result of electronic structure modifications while
   there is virtually no change in the double layer capacitance. This
   finding sheds some insight into the impact of the chemical and/or
   mechanical modifications of graphene-like electrodes on supercapacitor
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous 2-methylpiperazine (2MPZ) is an attractive solvent for CO2
   capture from coal-fired power plants. Quantitative NMR spectroscopy was
   used to speciate at 40 degrees C 8 m 2MPZ loaded with CO2. C-13 NMR
   spectra were acquired from 0 to 0.37 mol CO2/mol alkalinity (or per
   amino group). (CO2)-C-13 was used for solution preparation to amplify
   signals from carbamate and bicarbonate. The NMR spectra show that the
   unhindered 2MPZ monocarbamate is the dominant carbamate species and
   accounts for more than 75\% of the total dissolved CO2; bicarbonate and
   2MPZ dicarbamate each only account for up to 10\% of the total absorbed
   CO2. Hindered 2MPZ was not detected. This speciation and CO2 solubility
   were represented by an electrolyte nonrandom two liquid thermodynamic
   model developed through data regression. At a CO2 loading giving 1.5 kPa
   CO2 partial pressure at 40 degrees C the heat of CO2 absorption varies
   from SO to 75 kJ/mol at 40-140 degrees C. At 40 degrees C the
   equilibrium CO2 partial pressure was 0.5 kPa at 0.265 mol CO2/mol
   alkalinity and 5 kPa at 0.356 mol CO2/mol alkalinity. These values give
   an intrinsic CO2 operating capacity of 0.81 mol/kg (2MPZ + water)
   compared to 0.47 for 7 m MEA and 0.79 for 8 m piperazine.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 absorption into 8 molal (m) 2-methylpiperazine (2MPZ) is modeled in
   Aspen Plus using a previously developed rigorous thermodynamic model.
   With the regression of three reaction rate constants for carbamate and
   bicarbonate and one parameter for diffusion activation energy, the
   kinetic model represents CO2 flux measured in a wetted-wall column at
   40-100 degrees C with 0.1-0.4 mol CO2/mol alkalinity with a relative
   deviation from 20\% to 20\%. The kinetic reaction rate is interpreted
   with activity-based termolecular kinetics and the rate constants are
   correlated with the Bronsted theory. The liquid film mass transfer
   coefficient (kg) is well represented by the model at medium to rich CO2
   loading. The power to which k(g)' is dependent on the rate constant of
   2MPZ carbamate formation (k(2MPZ-2MPZ)) decreases from similar to 0.5 at
   very lean loading to nearly 0 at rich loading, whereas it is
   increasingly dependent upon the diffusion coefficient of the reactants
   and products and the physical liquid film mass transfer coefficient
   (k(l)(0)) as loading and temperature increases. In the liquid film, 2MPZ
   and 2MPZCOO(-) are the major reactants and protonated 2MPZ carbamate and
   bicarbonate are the major products. The pseudo-first-order region for
   2MPZ narrows and shifts to higher value of k(i)(0) as temperature
   increases. Under typical industrial conditions, the gas film resistance
   contributes less than 25\% of the total resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of Sr substitution on the crystal chemistry, phase
   stability, and electrochemical performance as cathodes in
   intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) of the
   layered LnBa(1-x)Sr(x)CoCuO(5+delta) (Ln = Nd and Gd) perovskites have
   been investigated. The LnBa(1-x)Sr(x)CoCuO(5+delta) oxides crystallize
   in tetragonal P4/mmm symmetry for 0 <= x <= 0.75. The x = 0.75 samples
   show a significant improvement in electrochemical performance compared
   to the x = 0 samples for both Ln = Nd and Gd. In an electrolyte
   (La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8)-supported single cell configuration
   (thickness = 0.50 mm), the Ln = Gd series shows an improved maximum
   power density from 468 mW cm(-2) for the Sr-free (x = 0) sample to 530
   mW cm(-2) for the x = 0.75 sample. In the Ln = Nd system, the x = 0.75
   sample shows a maximum power density of 562 mW cm(-2). The Sr
   substitution was found to have negligible effect on the thermal
   expansion coefficients (TEC) between the x = 0 and x = 0.75 samples in
   both series. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{A series of sulfonated random and block copolymers were adsorbed on the
   surface of similar to 100 nm iron oxide (IO) nanoparticles (NPs) to
   provide colloidal stability in extremely concentrated brine composed of
   8\% wt NaCl + 2\% wt CaCl2 (API brine; 1.4 M NaCl + 0.2 M CaCl2) at 90
   degrees C. A combinatorial materials chemistry approach, which employed
   Ca2+-mediated adsorption of anionic acrylic acid-containing sulfonated
   polymers to preformed citrate-stabilized IO nanoclusters, enabled the
   investigation of a large number of polymer coatings. Initially a series
   of poly(2-methyl-2-acrylamidopropanesulfonate-co-acrylic acid)
   (poly(AMPS-co-AA)) (1:8 to 1:1 mcl:mol),
   poly(styrenesulfonate-block-acrylic acid) (2.4:1 mol:mol), and
   poly(styrenesulfonate-alt-maleic acid) (3:1 mol:mol) copolymers were
   screened for solubility in API brine at 90 degrees C. The ratio of AMPS
   to AA groups was varied to balance the requirement of colloid
   dispersibility at high salinity (provided by AMPS) against the need for
   anchoring of the polymers to the iron oxide surface (via the AA). Steric
   stabilization of IO NPs coated with poly(AMPS-co-AA) (1:1 mol:mol)
   provided colloidal stability in API brine at room temperature and 90
   degrees C for up to 1 month. The particles were characterized before and
   after coating at ambient and elevated temperatures by a variety of
   techniques including colloidal stability experiments, dynamic light
   scattering, zeta potential, and thermogravimetric analysis.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{MAR 12}},
Abstract = {{Vanadium-doped olivine LiFePO4 cathode materials have been synthesized
   by a low-temperature microwave-assisted solvothermal (MW-ST) method at
   <= 300 degrees C. The samples have been extensively characterized by
   neutron/X-ray powder diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy,
   elemental analysis, electron microscopy, and electrochemical techniques.
   The compositions of the as-synthesized materials were found to be
   LiFe1-3x/2Vx square x/2PO4 (0 <= x <= 0.2) with the presence of a small
   number of lithium vacancies (square) charge-compensated by V4+, not
   Fe3+, leading to an average oxidation state of similar to 3.2+ for
   vanadium. The vacancies on the Fe site likely provide an additional
   conduction pathway for Li+ ions to transfer between neighboring 1D
   conduction channels along the crystallographic b axis. Heating the
   pristine 15\% V-doped sample in inert or reducing atmospheres led to a
   loss of vanadium from the olivine lattice with the concomitant formation
   of a Li3V2(PO4)(3) impurity phase; after phase segregation, a partially
   V-doped olivine phase remained. For comparison, V-doped samples were
   also synthesized by conventional ball milling and heating, but only
   similar to 10\% V could be accommodated in the olivine lattice in
   agreement with previous studies. The higher degree of doping realized
   with the MW-ST samples demonstrates the temperature dependence of the
   aliovalent-vanadium doping in LiFePO4.}},

Title = {{Protein-Protein Docking with F(2)Dock 2.0 and GB-Rerank}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: Computational simulation of protein-protein docking can
   expedite the process of molecular modeling and drug discovery. This
   paper reports on our new F-2 Dock protocol which improves the state of
   the art in initial stage rigid body exhaustive docking search, scoring
   and ranking by introducing improvements in the shape-complementarity and
   electrostatics affinity functions, a new knowledge-based interface
   propensity term with FFT formulation, a set of novel knowledge-based
   filters and finally a solvation energy (GBSA) based reranking technique.
   Our algorithms are based on highly efficient data structures including
   the dynamic packing grids and octrees which significantly speed up the
   computations and also provide guaranteed bounds on approximation error.
   Results: The improved affinity functions show superior performance
   compared to their traditional counterparts in finding correct docking
   poses at higher ranks. We found that the new filters and the GBSA based
   reranking individually and in combination significantly improve the
   accuracy of docking predictions with only minor increase in computation
   time. We compared F-2 Dock 2.0 with ZDock 3.0.2 and found improvements
   over it, specifically among 176 complexes in ZLab Benchmark 4.0, F-2
   Dock 2.0 finds a near-native solution as the top prediction for 22
   complexes; where ZDock 3.0.2 does so for 13 complexes. F-2 Dock 2.0
   finds a near-native solution within the top 1000 predictions for 106
   complexes as opposed to 104 complexes for ZDock 3.0.2. However, there
   are 17 and 15 complexes where F-2 Dock 2.0 finds a solution but ZDock
   3.0.2 does not and vice versa; which indicates that the two docking
   protocols can also complement each other.
   Availability: The docking protocol has been implemented as a server with
   a graphical client (TexMol) which allows the user to manage multiple
   docking jobs, and visualize the docked poses and interfaces. Both the
   server and client are available for download. Server:

Abstract = {{Cooling is a fundamental need as well as a significant energy consumer
   in a plethora of practically important applications. In this paper, we
   analyze latent-heat storage using phase-change materials (PCM) as a
   means for improving temperature control and energy management in cooling
   systems. We propose a novel, systems-centric approach to PCM-based
   thermal management and establish a connection between the quantity and
   geometric properties of the PCM, the dynamics of the integrated system,
   and potential energy savings. We show that the melting/solidification
   cycles of PCM provide a thermal buffer effect which can be relied upon
   to balance the use of passive and active cooling, reducing energy
   consumption. Subsequently, we focus on composite heat sinks consisting
   of PCM elements encapsulated in a conductive matrix material as a
   practical implementation of PCM-enhanced thermal management. Relying on
   concepts from nonlinear system identification and dynamic optimization,
   we formulate a novel stochastic optimization framework for selecting the
   optimal size and size distribution of the PCM elements for minimizing
   energy consumption under fluctuating loads. Finally, we illustrate our
   results with a case study.}},

Abstract = {{The 2011 M-W = 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake generated a large number of
   unique soil liquefaction case histories, including cases with strong
   ground motion recordings on liquefiable or potentially liquefiable
   soils. We have compiled a list of 22 strong motion stations (SMS) where
   surface evidence of liquefaction was observed and 16 SMS underlain by
   geologically recent sediments or fills where surface evidence of
   liquefaction was not observed. Pre-earthquake standard penetration test
   data and borehole shear wave velocity (V-s) profiles are available for
   some stations, but critical information, such as grain size distribution
   and fines plasticity, are often lacking. In the heavily damaged city of
   Urayasu, we performed post-earthquake cone penetration testing at seven
   SMS and V-s profiles, using surface wave methods at 28 additional
   locations to supplement existing geotechnical data. We describe the
   liquefaction effects in Urayasu, the available site characterization
   data, and our initial data interpretations.}},

Abstract = {{The power generated by wind turbines varies due to variations in the

   power source to alleviate the intermittency in the wind turbine power.
   An integrated wind turbine and battery storage system is constructed
   where the wind turbine is electrically connected to a rechargeable
   battery system. Such a system can operate in two modes depending on the
   wind speed, power demand, and battery limit. The switching conditions
   for the wind turbine to operate in multi- input, single- output and
   single- input, single- output control mode are discussed. Linearized
   approximations of the closed loop wind turbine system are derived in
   order to analyze the switching stability between control modes. Common
   quadratic Lyapunov function ( CQLF) is established for both control
   modes to prove the system stability. Simulation results demonstrating
   system stability are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: The pulmonary trunk (PT) structure and
   function are abnormal in multiple congenital cardiovascular diseases.
   Existing surgical treatments of congenital malformations of the right
   ventricular outflow tract and PT do not provide a long-term replacement
   that can adapt to normal growth. Although there is strong interest in
   developing tissue-engineered approaches for PT conduit replacement,
   there remains an absence of any complete investigation of the native
   geometric growth patterns of the PT to serve as a necessary benchmark.
   Methods: Eleven Dorset sheep (aged 4-12 months) underwent a single
   cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study, from which luminal arterial
   surface points were obtained using a novel semi-automated segmentation
   technique. The three-dimensional shapes of the PT and ascending aorta
   (AA) were measured over the same time period to gain insight into
   differences in the geometric changes between these two great vessels.
   Results: The volumetric growth of the PT appeared to be a linear
   function of age, whereas its surface geometry demonstrated non-uniform
   growth patterns. While tortuosity was maintained with age, the
   cross-sectional shape of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) evolved from
   circular in young animals to elliptical at 12 months. In addition, the
   distal MPA near the pulmonary artery bifurcation tapered with age.
   Conclusion: It can be concluded that postnatal growth of the PT is not a
   simple proportionate (i.e. isotropic) size increase, but rather exhibits
   complex three-dimensional geometric features during somatic growth.}},

Abstract = {{The exciting development of advanced nanostructured materials has driven
   the rapid growth of research in the field of electrochemical energy
   storage (EES) systems which are critical to a variety of applications
   ranging from portable consumer electronics, hybrid electric vehicles, to
   large industrial scale power and energy management. Owing to their
   capability to deliver high power performance and extremely long cycle
   life, electrochemical capacitors (ECs), one of the key EES systems, have
   attracted increasing attention in the recent years since they can
   complement or even replace batteries in the energy storage field,
   especially when high power delivery or uptake is needed. This review
   article describes the most recent progress in the development of
   nanostructured electrode materials for EC technology, with a particular
   focus on hybrid nanostructured materials that combine carbon based
   materials with pseudocapacitive metal oxides or conducting polymers for
   achieving high-performance ECs. This review starts with an overview of
   EES technologies and the comparison between various EES systems,
   followed by a brief description of energy storage mechanisms for
   different types of EC materials. This review emphasizes the exciting
   development of both hybrid nanomaterials and novel support structures
   for effective electrochemical utilization and high mass loading of
   active electrode materials, both of which have brought the energy
   density of ECs closer to that of batteries while still maintaining their
   characteristic high power density. Last, future research directions and
   the remaining challenges toward the rational design and synthesis of
   hybrid nanostructured electrode materials for next-generation ECs are
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The global nexus between energy and water introduces cross-sectoral
   vulnerabilities whereby water problems can become energy problems and
   vice versa. This creates cross-cutting opportunities where solutions for
   one sector might also be good for the other. However, the tradeoffs
   between prospective technical and policy solutions are not obvious. To
   address that challenge, this article presents a novel framework for
   analyzing coherence in technologies and policies at the energy-water
   nexus. Challenges are laid out, examples of mixes of technology and
   policies that can meet political objectives relevant to the energy-water
   nexus are given, gaps that inhibit future policy development are
   identified, and key findings are discussed. The analysis is presented
   through data specific to the United States along with a few case studies
   from other countries for illustration, but the framework is relevant to
   policymakers and decision makers globally. The article covers technical
   and environmental issues linking water and energy in electricity
   generation, liquid fuels production, and freshwater and wastewater
   treatment. It also explores the tradeoffs between specific technologies
   and policies relevant to the energy-water nexus. Some policies and
   technologies present solutions that achieve water and energy security,
   while others do not. Institutional reforms that could help water and
   energy policy to be more coherent, robust, and sustainable in the future
   are identified, and case studies from different countries are included
   to broaden the discussion. Finally, the article concludes by discussing
   emerging issues and information gaps in the energy-water nexus.}},

Abstract = {{Eigenvalue Ratio (ER) detector based on the two extreme eigenvalues of
   the received signal covariance matrix is currently one of the most
   effective solution for spectrum sensing. However, the analytical results
   of such scheme often depend on asymptotic assumptions since the
   distribution of the ratio of two extreme eigenvalues is exceptionally
   complex to compute. In this paper, a non-asymptotic spectrum sensing
   approach for ER detector is introduced to approximate the marginal and
   joint distributions of the two extreme eigenvalues. The two extreme
   eigenvalues are considered as dependent Gaussian random variables such
   that their joint probability density function (PDF) is approximated by a
   bivariate Gaussian distribution function for any number of cooperating
   secondary users and received samples. The PDF approximation approach is
   based on the moment matching method where we calculate the exact
   analytical moments of joint and marginal distributions of the two
   extreme eigenvalues. The decision threshold is calculated by exploiting
   the statistical mean and the variance of each of the two extreme
   eigenvalues and the correlation coefficient between them. The
   performance analysis of our newly proposed approximation approach is
   compared with the already published asymptotic Tracy-Widom approximation
   approach. It has been shown that our results are in perfect agreement
   with the simulation results for any number of secondary users and
   received samples.}},

Abstract = {{The sulfate resistance of mixtures containing six fly ashes was studied

   Quantitative analysis of the mineralogical composition of fly ashes was

   determined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA). The sulfate resistance of fly
   ash mortars was evaluated using the ASTM C1012/C1012M test. The
   performance of each fly ash in the sulfate resistance test was related
   to the chemical and mineralogical composition of the fly ash and its
   position on the ternary (CaO-SiO2-Al2O3) diagram. The study showed that
   the nature of glass is an important factor in determining the sulfate
   resistance of fly ash mixtures in a sulfate environment.}},

Title = {{A crossflow filtration system for constant permeate flux membrane
   fouling characterization}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Membrane fouling is often characterized using a crossflow filtration
   apparatus. Typically, the transmembrane pressure (TMP) difference is
   fixed, and the flux is allowed to decline as the membrane fouls and the
   resistance to mass transfer increases. However, as flux varies, so too
   does the rate at which foulants are brought to the membrane surface, so
   the observed fouling behavior is not solely the result of
   membrane/foulant interactions. Constant flux experiments, where the
   permeate flux is fixed and the TMP difference varies, minimize such
   variations in the hydrodynamic conditions at the membrane surface, but
   constant TMP difference experiments dominate the fouling literature
   because they are more straightforward to execute than constant flux
   experiments. Additionally, most industrial water purification membrane
   installations operate at constant flux rather than at constant TMP.
   Here, we describe the construction and operation of a constant flux
   crossflow fouling apparatus. System measurement accuracy was validated
   by comparison of pure water permeance measurements to values specified
   by the membrane manufacturer, reported elsewhere, and measured by
   another technique. Fouling experiments were performed with two
   membrane/foulant systems: polysulfone ultrafiltration membranes with a
   soybean oil emulsion foulant and PVDF microfiltration membranes with a
   polystyrene latex bead suspension foulant. Automatic permeate flux
   control facilitated flux stepping experiments, which are commonly used
   to determine the threshold flux or critical flux of a membrane/ foulant
   pair. Comparison of a flux stepping experiment with a literature report
   yielded good agreement. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Both silicon and germanium are leading candidates to replace the carbon
   anode of lithium ions batteries. Silicon Is attractive because of its
   high lithium storage capacity while germanium, a superior electronic and
   ionic conductor, can support much higher charge/discharge rates. Here we
   investigate the electronic, electrochemical and optical properties of
   Si(1-x)Gex thin films with x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. Glancing angle
   deposition provided amorphous films of reproducible nanostructure and
   porosity. The film's composition and physical properties were
   investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, four-point probe
   conductivity, Raman, and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The films were
   assembled into coin cells to test their electrochemical properties as a
   lithium-Ion battery anode material. The cells were cycled at various
   C-rates to determine the upper limits for high rate performance.
   Adjusting the composition In the Si(1-x)Gex system demonstrates a
   trade-off between rate capability and specific capacity. We show that
   high-capacity silicon anodes and high-rate germanium anodes are merely
   the two extremes; the composition of Si(1-x)Gex alloys provides a new
   parameter to use in electrode optimization.}},

   stability analysis}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is the car-following behavior including
   backward-looking, simply called the bi-directional looking car-following
   behavior. This study is motivated by the potential changes of the
   physical properties of traffic flow caused by the fast developing
   intelligent transportation system (ITS), especially the new connected
   vehicle technology. Existing studies on this topic focused on general
   motors (GM) models and optimal velocity (OV) models. The safe distance
   car-following model, Gipps' model, which is more widely used in practice
   have not drawn too much attention in the bi-directional looking context.
   This paper explores the property of the bi-directional looking extension
   of Gipps' safe distance model. The stability condition of the proposed
   model is derived using the linear stability theory and is verified using
   numerical simulations. The impacts of the driver and vehicle
   characteristics appeared in the proposed model on the traffic flow
   stability are also investigated. It is found that taking into account
   the backward-looking effect in car-following has three types of effect
   on traffic flow: stabilizing, destabilizing and producing non-physical
   phenomenon. This conclusion is more sophisticated than the study results
   based on the OV bi-directional looking car-following models. Moreover,
   the drivers who have the smaller reaction time or the larger additional
   delay and think the other vehicles have larger maximum decelerations can
   stabilize traffic flow.}},

Abstract = {{Relays in cellular systems are interference limited. The highest
   end-to-end sum rates are achieved when the relays are jointly optimized
   with the transmit strategy. Unfortunately, interference couples the
   links together, making joint optimization challenging. Further, the
   end-to-end multihop performance is sensitive to rate mismatch when some
   links have a dominant first link, whereas others have a dominant second
   link. This paper proposes an algorithm for designing the linear transmit
   precoders at the transmitters and relays of the relay interference
   broadcast channel, which is a generic model for relay-based cellular
   systems, to maximize the end-to-end sum rates. First, the relays are
   designed to maximize the second-hop sum rates. Next, approximate
   end-to-end rates that depend on the time-sharing fraction and the
   second-hop rates are used to formulate a sum-utility maximization
   problem to design the transmitters. This problem is solved by
   iteratively minimizing the weighted sum of mean square errors (MSEs).
   Finally, the norms of the transmit precoders at the transmitters are
   adjusted to eliminate rate mismatch. The proposed algorithm allows for
   distributed implementation and has fast convergence. Numerical results
   show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a reasonable application of
   single-hop interference management strategies separately on two hops.}},

Abstract = {{Polyetherimide/multi-wall carbon nanotube nanocomposite foams were
   fabricated and their electrical and mechanical properties characterized.
   The composites with 0.5-3 wt\% of carbon nanotube loadings were
   fabricated using a solution-based method. Different foaming conditions
   were studied along with the residual solvent effects. It was found that
   the residual solvent significantly affected the mechanical properties of
   the nanocompsites. Electrical conductivity of the composite foams with
   the same wt\% loading of carbon nanotubes was found to be dependent on
   the relative density of the foams. Foams with a higher relative density
   had a higher electrical conductivity. The fabricated polyetherimide
   nanocomposite foam is thermally stable, with a glass transition
   temperature close to that of the neat polyetherimide. Despite the volume
   expansion due to foaming, the polyetherimide nanocomposite foams
   achieved an electrical conductivity of 10(-7) S/cm at 2 wt\% carbon
   nanotube loading and 45\% relative density. This makes them a
   multifunctional material for lightweight and electrostatic dissipative
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Vulnerability assessment serves to identify vulnerabilities, develop
   responses, and drive the risk-management process. In identifying
   vulnerabilities, it is fundamental to identify and rank critical assets,
   which include vital systems, facilities, processes, and information
   necessary to maintain continuity of service. During emergencies in the
   facility management domain, first responders typically search for
   critical assets, both related to business continuity and value to the
   organization. This paper presents a formalized approach to reason about
   building systems and content to support vulnerability assessment in
   building emergencies caused by failures in building systems (e. g.,
   sprinkler line leak, power outage). The developed reasoning approach
   enables a first responder to perform flexible searches and prioritize
   critical spaces and pieces of equipment that need to be protected in an
   emergency by leveraging existing building and content representations
   found in building information models (BIM). This approach targets
   retrieving and prioritizing vulnerable content using a faceted
   classification-based approach. The faceted-retrieval mechanism was
   tested for precision and recall in retrieving vulnerable content in two
   scenarios with ten experts. Results show increased precision and recall
   (98 and 92\%, respectively) when all facets were used in the search.
   These results demonstrate that the faceted-retrieval mechanism more
   effectively retrieves content that need to be protected in building
   emergencies. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000214. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on calibration and validation of a hydrologic model
   of the Rio Conchos Basin, a main Mexican tributary of the binational Rio
   Grande Basin. The Rio Conchos provides approximately 55\% of the water
   deliveries to the United States under the 1944 water treaty signed
   between both countries. The hydrologic modeling has been developed using
   the one-dimensional, two-layer soil moisture accounting scheme embedded
   in the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model. A 10-year period was
   used to calibrate the model, which was achieved by a trial-and-error
   method for the adjustment of the model parameters. The results show a
   Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.84 at Ojinaga station (mouth of the
   basin) and 0.81 at La Boquilla, indicating good model performance. In
   general the model predicts well the monthly, annual, and maximum flows;
   but there are significant differences between the model values and
   undeveloped (naturalized) flows for low flow periods, especially at La
   Boquilla station. For model validation, a special period of 10 years was
   used, corresponding to drought conditions in the basin. Results show a
   Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.88 at Ojinaga station, with error in
   annual volume less than 1\% on average. DOI:

Abstract = {{Epidemiological investigations suggest a link between exposure to indoor
   air chemicals and adverse health effects. Consumer products contain
   reactive chemicals which can form secondary pollutants which may
   contribute to these effects. The reaction of limonene and ozone is a
   well characterized example of this type of indoor air chemistry. The
   studies described here characterize an in vitro model using an
   epithelial cell line (A549) or differentiated epithelial tissue
   (MucilAir (TM)). The model is used to investigate adverse effects
   following exposure to combinations of limonene and ozone. In A549 cells,
   exposure to both the parent compounds and reaction products resulted in
   alterations in inflammatory cytokine production. A one hour exposure to
   limonene + ozone resulted in decreased proliferation when compared to
   cells exposed to limonene alone. Repeated dose exposures of limonene or
   limonene + ozone were conducted on MucilAir (TM) tissue. No change in
   proliferation was observed but increases in cytokine production were
   observed for both the parent compounds and reaction products. Factors
   such as exposure duration, chemical concentration, and sampling time
   point were identified to influence result outcome. These findings
   suggest that exposure to reaction products may produce more severe
   effects compared to the parent compound. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Continuum-scale convective mixing in geological CO2 sequestration in
   anisotropic and heterogeneous saline aquifers}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{175-187}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Deep saline aquifers are important geological formations for CO2
   sequestration. It has been known that dissolution of CO2 increases brine
   density, which results in downward density-driven convection and
   consequently greatly enhances CO2 sequestration. In this study, a
   continuum-scale lattice Boltzmann model is used to investigate
   convective mixing of CO2 in saline aquifers. It is found that increasing
   permeability in either the vertical or horizontal direction accelerates
   the development of convective mixing. In a heterogeneous aquifer,
   increasing heterogeneity hampers the onset of convective mixing, because
   the heterogeneous permeability field results in a large portion of
   low-velocity region which reduces the instability of the system. The
   critical time for the onset of instability depends mainly on the
   coefficient of variation (COV) of the permeability field, and is
   insensitive to the correlation length. This implies that within the
   scale of critical time, mass transport is dominated by diffusion, and
   thus depends mainly on fine-scale heterogeneity controlled by COV. We
   derived an empirical formula for estimating the critical time, which
   leads to good estimates for all combinations of COV and correlation
   length. Fingering, channeling, and dispersion are the three mechanisms
   for mass transport. In dispersion, dissolved mass is approximately
   proportional to the square root of time, while in fingering and
   channeling it is approximately proportional to time. Mass transport by
   channeling depends significantly on permeability structure, while by
   fingering it is controlled by gravitational instability. It is also
   found that larger volumes of CO2 can be stored in heterogeneous aquifers
   because of higher mass dissolution rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{492-500}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The current mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG)
   postulates that zero-stress temperature (ZST) has substantial effects on
   the behavior and performance of Portland cement concrete (PCC)
   pavements. To date, the only available ZST prediction model for PCC
   pavements is the one proposed by the MEPDG, which was quite simplified
   with a function of only two input variables: cementitious content and
   mean monthly temperature for the month of construction. In this study,
   the feasibility of the current ZST prediction model in the MEPDG was
   assessed by comparing the ZSTs evaluated from a series of field tests
   with the ones estimated from the MEPDG model. In order to find ZSTs in
   actual PCC pavements, accurate evaluations of early-age concrete stress
   developments were essential. To achieve this aim, non-stress cylinders
   (NCs), which directly measure stress-independent strain in the field
   concrete structures, were employed. Once the stress-dependent strain
   history was estimated based on the measured total and stress-independent
   strain histories, it was converted to the stress history using a
   step-by-step numerical method considering creep and modulus developments
   of concrete. The results of this study showed that about 4.5-7.7 degrees
   C of differences existed between the measured and predicted ZST values.
   This finding strongly suggests a need for development of a more advanced
   ZST prediction model with reasonable assumptions and diverse parameters.

Abstract = {{Interference is a common impairment in wireless communication systems.
   Multi-hop relay networks use a set of intermediate nodes called relays
   to facilitate communication between multiple transmitters and multiple
   receivers through multiple hops. Relay based communication is especially
   sensitive to interference because the interference impacts both the
   received signal at the relay, and the received signal at the
   destination. Interference alignment is a signaling technique that
   provides high multiplexing gain in the interference channel. In this
   paper, inspired by an algorithmic approach for interference alignment,
   three cooperative algorithms are proposed to find suboptimal solutions
   for end-to-end sum-rate maximization problem in a multiple-antenna
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay interference channel. The first algorithm
   aims at minimizing the sum power of enhanced noise from the relays and
   interference at the receivers. The second and third algorithms aim at
   minimizing matrix-weighted sum mean square errors with either equality
   or inequality power constraints to utilize a connection between mean
   square error and mutual information. The resulting iterative algorithms
   are convergent to points that we conjecture to be stationary points of
   the corresponding problems. Simulations show that the proposed
   algorithms achieve higher end-to-end sum-rates and multiplexing gains
   that existing strategies for AF relays, decode-and-forward relays, and
   direct transmission. The first algorithm outperforms the other
   algorithms at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but performs worse than
   them at low SNR. Thanks to power control, the third algorithm
   outperforms the second algorithm at the cost of additional overhead.}},

Abstract = {{The field application of three different nondestructive tests
   (NDTs)-air-coupled impact echo (IE), infrared (IR) thermography, and
   sounding (chain drag)-are evaluated in this paper, where an actual
   in-service concrete bridge deck is tested. Two different contactless IE
   test equipment sets are deployed as part of an effort to develop new
   rapid measurement methods. The IE data are presented as two-dimensional
   frequency maps, and the IR data are presented as temperature maps over
   the tested area. Sounding (chain-drag) result maps are also presented.
   For verification of the location of near-surface delamination damage,
   eight drilled core samples were extracted from the test area. The
   results obtained from each of the individual NDT methods show reasonably
   good agreement with the drilled cores in terms of locating near-surface
   delamination. Finally, the NDT methods are compared across general
   performance criteria, considering accuracy, testing practicality, and
   costs. The analysis shows that all of the evaluated NDT methods are
   comparable, and the chain-drag method is not more accurate and reliable
   for detection of shallow delamination in the deck.

Abstract = {{We have described the determination of uranium in environmental,

   non-destructive nuclear methods. The effectiveness, as defined as the
   lower limits of detection in this work, of quantifying trace levels of
   bulk uranium in geological samples was evaluated for several common NAA
   techniques. These techniques include short-lived and medium-lived
   neutron activation analysis using thermal and epithermal neutrons; these
   results were compared with an assessment of Compton suppressed gamma-ray
   counting. A careful evaluation of three major (n,gamma) reactions with
   chlorine, manganese and sodium that could impede determining low levels
   of uranium due to high Compton continuums was done. The evaluation of
   Compton suppressed passive gamma counting revealed that uranium
   concentrations below 50 mg kg(-1) were not adequate to achieve good
   counting statistics using the Pa-234m the second daughter product of
   U-238. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible microporous scaffold membranes of poly(L-lactic acid)
   (PLLA)/poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) blend were developed for bone
   regeneration. The new membranes overcome the fragility problems of PLLA
   membranes. When the PCL content in the blend was increased to 50\%, the
   mechanical property for elongation was significantly improved without
   sacrificing the pores on the membrane surface that help tissue segments
   adhere the membrane. However, further increases in PCL content reduced
   the surface pores. In addition, spontaneous cell invasion and formation
   of cell-multilayers were observed in the membrane of PLLA/PCL blend
   (50:50). These results indicate that the porous membrane of PLLA/PCL

Abstract = {{Graphene is widely known for its anomalously strong broadband optical
   absorptivity of 2.3\% that enables seeing its single-atom layer with the
   naked eye. However, in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum graphene
   represents a quintessential lossless zero-volume plasmonic material. We
   experimentally demonstrate that, when integrated with Fano-resonant
   plasmonic metasurfaces, single-layer graphene (SLG) can be used to tune
   their mid-infrared optical response. SLG's plasmonic response is shown
   to induce large blue shifts of the metasurface's resonance without
   reducing its spectral sharpness. This effect is explained by a
   generalized perturbation theory of SLG-metamaterial interaction that
   accounts for two unique properties of the SLG that set it apart from all
   other plasmonic materials: its anisotropic response and zero volume.
   These results pave the way to using gated SLG as a platform for
   dynamical spectral tuning of infrared metamaterials and metasurfaces.}},

Title = {{Correction of invasion effects on well logs in Camisea gas reservoirs,

Journal = {{AAPG BULLETIN}},

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{The concept of common stratigraphic framework was previously introduced
   to construct and cross-validate mutilayer static and dynamic
   petrophysical models by invoking the interactive numerical simulation of
   well logs both before and after invasion. This article documents the
   successful implementation of the common stratigraphic framework concept
   to examine and quantify the effects of mud-filtrate invasion on apparent
   resistivity, nuclear, and magnetic resonance logs acquired in the San
   Martin, Cashiriari, and Pagoreni gas fields in Camisea, Peru.
   Conventional petrophysical interpretation methods yield abnormally high
   estimates of water saturation in some of the reservoir units that
   produce gas with null water influx. Such an anomalous behavior is caused
   by relatively low values of deep apparent electrical resistivity and has
   otherwise been attributed to the presence of clay-coating grains and/or
   electrically conductive grain minerals coupled with fresh connate water.
   Concomitantly, electrical resistivity logs exhibit substantial invasion
   effects as evidenced by the variable separation of apparent resistivity
   curves (both logging-while-drilling and wireline) with multiple radial
   lengths of investigation. In extreme cases, apparent resistivity logs
   stack because of very deep invasion. We diagnose and quantify invasion
   effects on resistivity and nuclear logs with interactive numerical
   modeling before and after invasion. The assimilation of such effects in
   the interpretation consistently decreases previous estimates of water
   saturation to those of irreducible water saturation inferred from core
   data. We show that capillary pressure effects are responsible for the
   difference in separation of apparent resistivity curves in some of the
   reservoir units. This unique field study confirms that well logs should
   be corrected for mud-filtrate invasion effects before implementing
   arbitrary shaly sand models and parameters thereof in the calculation of
   connate-water saturation.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Using Boussinesq scaling for water waves while imposing no constraints
   on rotationality, we derive and test model equations for nonlinear water
   wave transformation over varying depth. These use polynomial basis
   functions to create velocity profiles which are inserted into the basic
   equations of motion keeping terms up to the desired Boussinesq scaling
   order, and solved in a weighted residual sense. The models show rapid
   convergence to exact solutions for linear dispersion, shoaling, and
   orbital velocities; however, properties may be substantially improved
   for a given order of approximation using asymptotic rearrangements. This
   improvement is accomplished using the large numbers of degrees of
   freedom inherent in the definitions of the polynomial basis functions
   either to match additional terms in a Taylor series, or to minimize
   errors over a range. Explicit coefficients are given at O(mu(2)) and
   O(mu(4)), while more generalized basis functions are given at higher
   order. Nonlinear performance is somewhat more limited as, for reasons of
   complexity, we only provide explicitly lower order nonlinear terms.
   Still, second order harmonics may remain good to kh approximate to 10
   for O(mu(4)) equations. Numerical tests for wave transformation over a
   shoal show good agreement with experiments. Future work will harness the
   full rotational performance of these systems by incorporating turbulent
   and viscous stresses into the equations, making them into surf zone
   models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   doi:10.1152/jn.00435.2012.-The properties of voltage-gated ion channels
   on the neuronal membrane shape electrical activity such as generation
   and backpropagation of action potentials, initiation of dendritic
   spikes, and integration of synaptic inputs. Subthreshold currents
   mediated by sodium channels are of interest because of their activation
   near rest, slow inactivation kinetics, and consequent effects on
   excitability. Modulation of these currents can also perturb
   physiological responses of a neuron that might underlie pathological
   states such as epilepsy. Using nucleated patches from the peri-somatic
   region of hippocampal CA1 neurons, we recorded a slowly inactivating
   component of the macroscopic Na+ current (which we have called I-NaS)
   that shared many biophysical properties with the persistent Na+ current,
   I-NaP, but showed distinctively faster inactivating kinetics. Ramp
   voltage commands with a velocity of 400 mV/s were found to elicit this
   component of Na+ current reliably. I-NaS also showed a more
   hyperpolarized I-V relationship and slower inactivation than those of
   the fast transient Na+ current (I-NaT) recorded in the same patches. The
   peak amplitude of I-NaS was proportional to the peak amplitude of I-NaT
   but was much smaller in amplitude. Hexanol, riluzole, and ranolazine,
   known Na+ channel blockers, were tested to compare their effects on both
   I-NaS and I-NaT. The peak conductance of I-NaS was preferentially
   blocked by hexanol and riluzole, but the shift of half-inactivation
   voltage (V-1/2) was only observed in the presence of riluzole.
   Current-clamp measurements with hexanol suggested that I-NaS was
   involved in generation of an action potential and in upregulation of
   neuronal excitability.}},

Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{85-94}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Displacement-length data from dilatant fractures (joints, veins, igneous
   dikes) and several varieties of deformation bands were analyzed
   statistically to investigate the applicability of mechanical models
   proposed for their formation. All 17 datasets are generally consistent
   with equilibrium or long-term power-law slopes on the
   displacement-length diagram of either 1.0 or 0.5. Similar to many
   faults, disaggregation deformation bands are consistent with a power-law
   scaling relation having a slope of approximately c = 1, implying a
   linear dependence of maximum displacement and discontinuity length
   (D-max = gamma L). In contrast, dilatant fractures, cataclastic
   deformation bands, and shear-enhanced compaction bands are consistent
   with a power-law scaling relation with a slope of approximately c = 0.5,
   implying a dependence of maximum displacement on the square root of
   length (D-max = alpha L-1/2). The scaling relations represent an
   average, or long-term equilibrium outcome of deformation for conditions
   such as length-scale, time-scale, temperature, chemistry, and an
   effectively homogeneous far-field stress field, allowing for variations
   such as rapid and/or localized behaviors. The displacement-length
   scaling of these geologic structures follows systematic relationships
   that provide information on host-rock properties and the physics of
   fracture and deformation-band propagation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Aims: To predict the deposition of nanoparticles in a patient-specific
   arterial tree as a function of the vascular architecture, flow
   conditions, receptor surface density and nanoparticle properties.
   Materials \& methods: The patient-specific vascular geometry is
   reconstructed from computed tomography angiography images. The
   isogeometric analysis framework integrated with a special boundary
   condition for the firm wall adhesion of nanoparticles is implemented. A
   parallel plate flow chamber system is used to validate the computational
   model in vitro. Results: Particle adhesion is dramatically affected by
   changes in patient-specific attributes, such as branching angle and
   receptor density. The adhesion pattern correlates well with the spatial
   and temporal distribution of the wall shear rates. For the case
   considered, the larger (2.0 mu m) particles adhere two-times more in the
   lower branches of the arterial tree, whereas the smaller (0.5 mu m)
   particles deposit more in the upper branches. Conclusion: Our
   computational framework in conjunction with patient-specific attributes
   can be used to rationally select nanoparticle properties to personalize,
   and thus optimize, therapeutic interventions. Original submitted 30

Abstract = {{An experimental study was performed to examine current code requirements

   full-scale tests were conducted in which the shear span-depth ratio

   reinforcement was the primary variable. Web reinforcement ranged from 0
   to 0.3\% in the vertical and horizontal directions. The compressive
   strength of concrete of the test specimens ranged from 3200 to 5000 psi
   (22 to 34 MPa). Diagonal cracking loads, diagonal crack widths, and
   failure shears were recorded for each test. The results indicated that a
   larger quantity of web reinforcement was needed to adequately restrain
   the width of diagonal cracks than to provide adequate deep beam shear
   capacity. Based on the strength and serviceability results, a minimum
   web reinforcement of 0.3\% in each orthogonal direction was recommended

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new model and solution methodology for a
   real-world production scheduling problem arising in the electronics
   industry. The production environment is a high volume, just-in-time,
   make-to-order facility with volatile demand over many product families
   that are assembled on flexible lines. A distinguishing characteristic of
   the problem is the presence of non-traditional sequence-dependant setup
   costs, which complicate our ability to find high-quality solutions. The
   scheduling problem arose when product variety exceeded the mix that the
   existing lines could accommodate. A nonlinear integer programming
   formulation is presented for the problem of minimizing setup costs, and
   a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is developed to
   find solutions. To select the GRASP parameter values, an efficient,
   space-filling experimental design method is used based on nearly
   orthogonal Latin hypercubes. The proposed methodology is tested on
   actual factory data and compared to a prior heuristic presented in the
   literature; our heuristic provides a cost savings in 7 out of the 10
   cases examined, and an average improvement of 17.39 \% which is shown to
   be highly statistically significant. This improvement is due in part to
   the introduction of a pre-processing step to determine preferential and
   non-preferential line assignment information.}},

   to simulate the support of a healthy or failing native heart from a
   continuous flow left ventricular assist device or a synchronous
   pulsatile valveless dual-piston positive displacement pump. These
   results were compared with measurements made during in vivo porcine
   experiments. Results from the simulation model and from the in vivo
   counterpart show that the pulsatile pump provides higher cardiac output,
   left ventricular unloading, cardiac pulsatility, and aortic valve flow
   as compared with the continuous flow model at the same level of support.
   The dynamic system model developed for this investigation can
   effectively simulate human cardiovascular support by a synchronous
   pulsatile or continuous flow ventricular assist device. ASAIO Journal

Abstract = {{Thin-film photovoltaic devices (PVs) were prepared by selenization using
   oleylamine-capped Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) nanocrystals sintered at a high
   temperature (>500 degrees C) under Se vapor. The device performance
   varied significantly with {[}Ga]/{[}In+Ga] content in the nanocrystals.
   The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) observed in the devices
   studied was 5.1\% under air mass 1.5global (AM1.5G) illumination,
   obtained with {[}Ga]/{[}In+Ga]=0.32. The variation in PCE with
   composition is partly a result of bandgap tuning and optimization, but
   the main influence of nanocrystal composition appeared to be on the
   quality of the sintered films. The {[}Cu]/{[}In+Ga] content was found to
   be strongly influenced by the {[}Ga]/{[}In+Ga] concentration, which
   appears to be correlated with the morphology of the sintered film. For
   this reason, only small changes in the {[}Ga]/{[}In+Ga] content resulted
   in significant variations in device efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A fully Eulerian framework formulation for solving time-dependent
   fluid-structure interaction problems is proposed in this work Although
   some preliminary work on this approach exists for stationary
   configurations, it remains to validate nonstationary processes. The
   formulation is stated in an implicit monolithic frame of reference. A
   finite difference scheme is used for temporal discretization whereas the
   spatial discretization is based on a Galerkin finite element scheme. The
   nonlinear problem is solved with a Newton method and with analytical
   evaluation of the Jacobian matrix. In contrast to interface tracking
   methods (for example, the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach), the
   interface must be captured, which is similar to the level-set method.
   Consequently, the interface is allowed to intersect mesh cells, which is
   a crucial difficulty of this method where appropriate treatment must be
   suggested. The proposed formulation is substantiated by three numerical
   tests in which the performance of fully Eulerian fluid-structure
   interaction is demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Discretization is a common decision analysis technique for which many
   methods are described in the literature and employed in practice. The
   accuracy of these methods is typically judged by how well they match the
   mean, variance, and possibly higher moments of the underlying continuous
   probability distribution. Previous authors have analyzed the accuracy of
   differing discretization methods across a limited set of distributions
   drawn from particular families (e.g., the bell-shaped beta
   distributions). In this paper, we extend this area of research by (i)
   using the Pearson distribution system to consider a wide range of
   distribution shapes and (ii) including common, but previously
   unexplored, discretization methods. In addition, we propose new
   three-point discretizatiorts tailored to specific distribution types
   that improve upon existing methods.}},

   solvers on a collection of parallel octree-based adaptive finite element
   libraries that support new distributed data structures and parallel
   algorithms for dynamic coarsening, refinement, rebalancing and
   repartitioning of the mesh. In this study we demonstrate scalability to

   present the numerical approximation and convergence properties using 3-D

Abstract = {{Inhalation of low-density porous particles enables deep lung delivery
   with less dependence on device design and patient inspiration. The
   purpose of this study was to implement Thin Film Freezing (TFF) to
   investigate a novel approach to dry powder inhalation.
   Powders produced by TFF were evaluated for aerodynamic and geometric
   particle size by cascade impaction and laser light scattering,
   respectively. Density measurements were conducted according to USP
   methods and calculated using data from particle size measurements.
   Excipient inclusion and its effect on moisture sorption was measured by
   Dynamic Vapor Sorption (DVS).
   TFF-produced brittle matrix powders were sheared apart into respirable
   microparticles using a passive DPI device, producing fine particle
   fractions (FPF) up to 69\% and mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMAD)
   as low as 2.6 mu m. Particles had a mean geometric diameter ranging from
   25 mu m to 50 mu m and mass densities of approximately 0.01 g/cm(3).
   Powders were susceptible to moisture-induced matrix collapse, capillary
   forces and electrostatic charging; although formulations containing
   mannitol or no sugar excipient proved to be more robust.
   Aerosolized brittle matrices produced by TFF may prove to be a useful
   platform for highly efficient pulmonary delivery of thermally labile,
   highly potent, and poorly soluble drugs.}},

Abstract = {{MRI is a versatile tool for the systematic assessment of anatomical and
   functional changes in small-animal models of human disease. Its
   noninvasive nature makes it an ideal candidate for longitudinal
   evaluations of disease progression, but relatively long scan times limit
   the number of observations that can be made in a given interval of time,
   imposing restrictions on experimental design and potentially
   compromising statistical power. Methods that reduce the overall time
   required to scan multiple cohorts of animals in distinct experimental
   groups are therefore highly desirable. Multiple-mouse MRI, in which
   several animals are simultaneously scanned in a common MRI system, has
   been successfully used to improve study throughput. However, to best
   utilize the next generation of small-animal MRI systems that will be
   equipped with an increased number of receive channels, a paradigm shift
   from the simultaneous scanning of as many animals as possible to the
   scanning of a more manageable number, at a faster rate, must be
   considered. This work explores the tradeoffs between the number of
   animals to scan at once and the number of array elements dedicated to
   each animal, to maximize throughput in systems with 16 receive channels.
   An array system consisting of 15 receive and five transmit coils allows
   acceleration by a combination of multi-animal and parallel imaging
   techniques. The array system was designed and fabricated for use on a
   7.0-T/30-cm Bruker Biospec MRI system, and tested for high-throughput
   imaging performance in phantoms and live mice. Results indicate that up
   to a nine-fold throughput improvement of a single sequence is possible
   compared with an unaccelerated single-animal acquisition. True data
   throughput of a contrast-enhanced anatomical study is estimated to be
   improved by just over six-fold. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Journal = {{BUILDING SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-79}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Designing for wind-driven cross ventilation is challenging due to many
   factors. While studies have focused on the difficulty of predicting the
   total flow rate and measuring opening characteristics of cross
   ventilation, few have investigated the impacts on the distribution of
   indoor air. This paper provides insights on how local heat sources can
   generate significant buoyancy driven flow and affect indoor mixing
   during wind-driven cross ventilation scenarios. Measurements of air
   distribution were conducted by a tracer gas method for a multi-zone test
   building located in Austin, Texas, USA, along with cross ventilation
   flow at the openings. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was also
   developed for this test building, which utilizes the measured flow
   properties at the openings as boundary conditions. Resulting air
   distribution patterns from the CFD model were then compared to the
   experimental data, validating the model. Further parametric analyses
   were also conducted to demonstrate the effect of interior heat loads in
   driving internal air mixing. Key findings of the investigation suggest a
   local heat source smaller than 35 W/m(2) can increase the indoor mixing
   during cross ventilation from less than 1 air exchange to as high as 8
   air exchanges per hour. This result also suggests a typical occupancy
   scenario (people and electronics) can generate enough heat loads to
   change the indoor air mixing and alter the effect of cross ventilation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of preheated reactants on syngas production from a
   methane/air flame was investigated over a range of inlet temperatures up
   to 630 K. In addition to experimental measurements, the results from a
   burner-stabilized flame and freely-propagating flame models are
   presented. A comparison of the modeling and experimental results in
   terms of flame standoff distance, stability limit conditions and species
   yields show excellent agreement across a broad range of equivalence
   ratios and preheat temperatures. Preheating of reactants increased the
   rich limit for stable operation from 1.26 to 1.75 for a given inlet
   velocity, and syngas yields were shown to increase with equivalence
   ratio. The preheat temperature of the reactants was shown to have little
   impact on syngas yields beyond extending the limits of stable operation.
   The results of this study are useful for the design and analysis of heat
   recirculating reactors and other reactors that are designed for
   producing syngas through the combustion of rich mixtures. (C) 2012 The

   vapor for H-2 purification and moisture effect on gas permeation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{430}},
Pages = {{223-233}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{We have demonstrated the use of diethylenetriamine (DETA) for
   vapor-phase modification of 6FDA-polyimide membranes for improving
   H-2/CO2 separation performance. The effectiveness of DETA as the
   crosslinker was compared using the conventional solution-phase and the
   new vapor-phase modification approaches. It is demonstrated that the
   latter approach is favored in view of the better membrane tensile
   properties, gas permeation properties and environmental friendliness.
   The effects of vapor-phase modification parameters, temperature and
   duration, on the effectiveness of H-2/CO2 separation were investigated
   by evaluating the gas permeation properties in the resultant films using
   pure gas, dry-state and wet-state mixed gases. A series resistance model
   for a simplified reaction progression was applied to evaluate the
   intrinsic gas permeation properties of the modified layers attained from
   thick films. Much thinner films, however, provide an improved means of
   assessment. Compared to pure gas permeability, the H-2 permeability
   decreases significantly while the CO2 permeability is almost not
   affected in dry-state mixed gas tests (H-2:CO2=50:50 vol\%). In the
   wet-state mixed gas tests (relative humidity similar to 50\%), the H-2
   permeability further drops in the modified films; the CO2 permeability
   drops in the unmodified films or films with a shorter modification
   duration (3 min), owing to sorption competition with highly condensable
   water; whereas, the CO2 permeability increases unexpectedly in membranes
   with extended modifications (>6 min), which is attributed to the water
   enhanced amine-induced sorption effect on transport when the modified
   membrane contains a large amount of amine groups. Overall, the DETA
   induced polyimide surface modification shows significant improvement for
   H-2/CO2 separation but the performance decreases when a humid feed gas
   stream is used. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{548-560}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) technology is a promising potential
   alternative to CMOS technology. To explore the characteristics of QCA
   and suitable design methodologies, digital circuit design approaches
   have been investigated. Due to the inherent wire delay in QCA, pipelined
   architectures appear to be a particularly suitable design technique.
   Also, because of the pipeline nature of QCA technology, it is not
   suitable for a complicated control system design. Systolic arrays take
   advantage of pipelining, parallelism, and simple local control.
   Therefore, an investigation into these architectures in semiconductor
   QCA technology is provided in this paper. Two case studies, (a matrix
   multiplier and a Galois Field multiplier) are designed and analyzed
   based on both multilayer and coplanar crossings. The performance of
   these two types of interconnections are compared and it is found that
   even though coplanar crossings are currently more practical, they tend
   to occupy a larger design area and incur slightly more delay. A general
   semiconductor QCA systolic array design methodology is also proposed. It
   is found that by applying a systolic array structure in QCA design,
   significant benefits can be achieved particularly with large systolic
   arrays, even more so than when applied in CMOS-based technology.}},

Abstract = {{A novel dermoscopy image segmentation algorithm is proposed using a
   combination of a self-generating neural network (SGNN) and the genetic
   algorithm (GA). Optimal samples are selected as seeds using GA; taking
   these seeds as initial neuron trees, a self-generating neural forest
   (SGNF) is generated by training the rest of the samples using SGNN. Next
   the number of clusters is determined by optimizing the SD index of
   cluster validity, and clustering is completed by treating each neuron
   tree as a cluster. Since SGNN often delivers inconsistent cluster
   partitions owing to sensitivity relative to the input order of the
   training samples, GA is combined with SGNN to optimize and stabilize the
   clustering result. In the post-processing phase, the clusters are merged
   into lesion and background skin, yielding the segmented dermoscopy
   image. A series of experiments on the proposed model and the other
   automatic segmentation methods (including Otsu's thresholding method,
   k-means, fuzzy c-means (FCM) and statistical region merging (SRM))
   reveals that the optimized model delivers better accuracy and
   segmentation results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon-supported Pt@PdCu5 core-shell nanoparticles (Pt@PdCu5/C) with Pt
   contents from 14 to 49 atom \% have been synthesized by first preparing
   the PdCu5/C cores by polyol reduction followed by an aqueous galvanic
   displacement reaction to obtain the Pt-rich shell. The effect of Pt
   coverage on oxygen reduction reaction and methanol tolerance was
   investigated. Pt surface enrichment has been confirmed by comparing the
   near surface to bulk metal composition. Initial cyclic voltammograms
   show less Cu dissolution from Pt@PdCu5/C with 49\% Pt compared to
   samples with less Pt, consistent with estimates of Pt coverage. The
   methanol tolerance of the Pt@PdCu5/C series decreases with increasing Pt
   content as indicated by the negatively shifting CO oxidation potential.
   For Pt@PdCu5/C - 14\% Pt, the positively shifted CO oxidation potential
   indicates the presence of surface Pd leading to increased methanol
   tolerance compared to Pt/C. Cu dissolution from Pt@PdCu5/C in the
   membrane-electrode assembly greatly affects the single cell performance.
   Acid washing of the Pt@PdCus/C with 27\% Pt cathode is required to
   obtain a stable direct methanol fuel cell polarization curve, and at
   methanol concentrations >0.5 M, the activity at 0.4 V becomes less than
   that with Pt/C.}},

Abstract = {{We show that electrodynamic dipolar interactions, responsible for
   long-range fluctuations in matter, play a significant role in the
   stability of molecular crystals. Density functional theory calculations
   with van der Waals interactions determined from a semilocal
   ``atom-in-a-molecule{''} model result in a large overestimation of the
   dielectric constants and sublimation enthalpies for polyacene crystals
   from naphthalene to pentacene, whereas an accurate treatment of nonlocal
   electrodynamic response leads to an agreement with the measured values
   for both quantities. Our findings suggest that collective response
   effects play a substantial role not only for optical excitations, but
   also for cohesive properties of noncovalently bound molecular crystals.

Abstract = {{Hybrid nanostructures with unique optical and magnetic properties have
   attracted considerable interest as effective mediators for medical
   imaging and therapy. An aqueous-based, self-assembly approach to
   synthesizing hybrid plasmonic superparamagnetic nanostructures is
   presented. The building blocks of the hybrid nanostructure include
   plasmonic gold nanorods (AuNRs) and superparamagnetic iron oxide
   nanoparticles (SPIONs). The AuNRs were functionalized via
   carboxyl-bearing surface ligands, and the SPIONs were kept ``bare{''}
   after synthesis via a surfactant-free thermal decomposition reaction in
   triethylene glycol. Hybrid SPION-studded AuNR nanostructures were
   produced upon simple mixing of the components because of the
   chemisorption of the AuNRs' free carboxyl groups to the SPIONs'
   surfaces. The reported synthesis strategy is modular in nature and can
   be expanded to build hybrid nanostructures with a multitude of other
   plasmonic nanoparticles. With tunable near-infrared absorption peaks and
   a sufficient number of bound SPIONs, the self-assembled hybrid
   nanostructures are suitable for biomedical imaging and therapy
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the use of the micro-Brillouin light scattering
   (micro-BLS) technique as a local temperature sensor for magnons in a
   permalloy (Py) thin film and phonons in the glass substrate. When the Py
   film is uniformly heated, we observe a systematic shift in the
   frequencies of two thermally excited perpendicular standing spin wave
   modes. Fitting the temperature dependent magnon spectra allows us to
   achieve a temperature resolution better than 2.5 K. In addition, we
   demonstrate that the micro-BLS spectra can be used to measure the local
   temperature of magnons and the relative temperature shift of phonons
   across a thermal gradient. Such local temperature sensors are useful for
   investigating spin caloritronic and thermal transport phenomena in
   general. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Altering prosthetic foot stiffness influences foot and muscle function

Abstract = {{Most prosthetic feet are designed to improve amputee gait by storing and
   releasing elastic energy during stance. However, how prosthetic foot
   stiffness influences muscle and foot function is unclear. Identifying
   these relationships would provide quantitative rationale for prosthetic
   foot prescription that may lead to improved amputee gait. The purpose of
   this study was to identify the influence of altered prosthetic foot
   stiffness on muscle and foot function using forward dynamics simulations
   of amputee walking. Three 2D muscle-actuated forward dynamics
   simulations of unilateral below-knee amputee walking with a range of
   foot stiffness levels were generated, and muscle and prosthetic foot
   contributions to body support and propulsion and residual leg swing were
   quantified. As stiffness decreased, the prosthetic keel provided
   increased support and braking (negative propulsion) during the first
   half of stance while the heel contribution to support decreased. During
   the second half of stance, the keel provided decreased propulsion and
   increased support. In addition, the keel absorbed less power from the
   leg, contributing more to swing initiation. Thus, several muscle
   compensations were necessary. During the first half of stance, the
   residual leg hamstrings provided decreased support and increased
   propulsion. During the second half of stance, the intact leg vasti
   provided increased support and the residual leg rectus femoris
   transferred increased energy from the leg to the trunk for propulsion.
   These results highlight the influence prosthetic foot stiffness has on
   muscle and foot function throughout the gait cycle and may aid in
   prescribing feet of appropriate stiffness. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Surgical replacement of the pulmonary valve (PV) is a common treatment
   option for congenital pulmonary valve defects. Engineered tissue
   approaches to develop novel PV replacements are intrinsically complex,
   and will require methodical approaches for their development. Single
   leaflet replacement utilizing an ovine model is an attractive approach
   in that candidate materials can be evaluated under valve level stresses
   in blood contact without the confounding effects of a particular valve
   design. In the present study an approach for optimal leaflet shape
   design based on finite element (FE) simulation of a mechanically
   anisotropic, elastomeric scaffold for PV replacement is presented. The
   scaffold was modeled as an orthotropic hyperelastic material using a
   generalized Fung-type constitutive model. The optimal shape of the fully
   loaded PV replacement leaflet was systematically determined by
   minimizing the difference between the deformed shape obtained from FE
   simulation and an ex-vivo microCT scan of a native ovine PV leaflet.
   Effects of material anisotropy, dimensional changes of PV root, and
   fiber orientation on the resulting leaflet deformation were
   investigated. In-situ validation demonstrated that the approach could
   guide the design of the leaflet shape for PV replacement surgery. (c)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Recent experiments showed that the reconfiguration dynamics of unfolded
   proteins are often adequately described by simple polymer models. In
   particular, the Rouse model with internal friction (RIF) captures
   internal friction effects as observed in single-molecule fluorescence
   correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies of a number of proteins. Here we
   use RIF, and its non-free draining analog, Zimm model with internal
   friction, to explore the effect of internal friction on the rate with
   which intramolecular contacts can be formed within the unfolded chain.
   Unlike the reconfiguration times inferred from FCS experiments, which
   depend linearly on the solvent viscosity, the first passage times to
   form intramolecular contacts are shown to display a more complex
   viscosity dependence. We further describe scaling relationships obeyed
   by contact formation times in the limits of high and low internal
   friction. Our findings provide experimentally testable predictions that
   can serve as a framework for the analysis of future studies of contact
   formation in proteins. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Ribosomes, the protein factories of living cells, translate genetic
   information carried by messenger RNAs into proteins, and are thus
   involved in virtually all aspects of cellular development and
   maintenance. The few available structures of the eukaryotic
   ribosome(1-6) reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic
   counterpart(7,8), owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific
   ribosomal proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called
   expansion segments(9). The structures also differ among species, partly
   in the size and arrangement of these expansion segments. Such
   differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular eukaryotic
   parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a high-resolution
   cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma
   brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that
   causes African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique
   features of this ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of
   unusually large expansion segments and ribosomal-protein extensions
   leading to the formation of four additional inter-subunit bridges. We
   also find additional rRNA insertions, including one large rRNA domain
   that is not found in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the structure
   reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid large ribosomal
   subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely into six
   pieces(10-12), and suggests that the cleavage is important for the
   maintenance of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We
   discuss several possible implications of the large rRNA expansion
   segments for the translation-regulation process. The structure could
   serve as a basis for future experiments aimed at understanding the
   functional importance of these kinetoplastid-specific ribosomal features
   in protein-translation regulation, an essential step towards finding
   effective and safe kinetoplastid-specific drugs.}},

Abstract = {{A new pyroxene compound, NaMnGe2O6, has been synthesized at 3 GPa and
   800 degrees C and fully characterized by X-ray single-crystal
   diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, and measurements of
   magnetization and specific heat. NaMnGe2O6 crystallizes into a
   monoclinic C2/c structure with unit-cell parameters a = 9.859(2)
   angstrom, b = 8.7507(18) angstrom, c = 5.5724(11) angstrom, and beta =
   105.64(3)degrees at 153 K.A cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion is formed
   by an ordering of the longest Mn-O bonds between two neighboring
   octahedra along the chain direction. This feature distinguishes
   NaMnGe2O6 from other pyroxene compounds without Jahn-Teller active
   cations and suggests that the Jahn-Teller distortion competes with the
   intrinsic local distortion in the pyroxene structure. No orbital
   order-disorder transition has been found up to 750 K. Like other
   alkali-metal pyroxenes with S > 1/2, NaMnGe2O6 (S = 2) was found to
   undergo a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering at T-N = 7 K due to
   intrachain and interchain exchange interactions. Due to the peculiar
   structural features and the corresponding magnetic coupling, the weak AF
   spin ordering gives way to a ferromagnetic-like state at a sufficiently
   high magnetic field. Specific-heat measurements demonstrated that a
   large portion of the magnetic entropy, >60\%, has been removed above T-N
   as a result of strong spin correlations within the quasi-one-dimensional
   Mn3{*}-spin chains. The Reitveld refinement of neutron powder
   diffraction data gives a commensurate magnetic structure defined by k =
   {[}0 0 0.5] with Mn moments aligned mainly along the c-axis with a small
   component along both a- and b-axes.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed and validated a methodology for determining the
   antibody composition of the polyclonal serum response after
   immunization. Pepsin-digested serum IgGs were subjected to standard
   antigen-affinity chromatography, and resulting elution, wash, and
   flow-through fractions were analyzed by bottom-up, liquid
   chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Identification
   of individual monoclonal antibodies required the generation of a
   database of IgG variable gene (V-gene) sequences constructed by NextGen
   sequencing of mature B cells. Antibody V-gene sequences are
   characterized by short complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of
   high diversity adjacent to framework regions shared across thousands of
   IgGs, greatly complicating the identification of antigen-specific IgGs
   from proteomically observed peptides. By mapping peptides marking unique
   V-H CDRH3 sequences, we identified a set of V-genes heavily enriched in
   the affinity chromatography elution, constituting the serum polyclonal
   response. After booster immunization in a rabbit, we find that the
   antigenspecific serum immune response is oligoclonal, comprising
   antibodies encoding 34 different CDRH3s that group into 30 distinct
   antibody V-H clonotypes. Of these 34 CDRH3s, 12 account for similar to
   60\% of the antigen-specific CDRH3 peptide mass spectral counts. For
   comparison, antibodies with 18 different CDRH3s (12 clonotypes) were
   represented in the antigen-specific IgG fraction from an unimmunized
   rabbit that fortuitously displayed a moderate titer for BSA.
   Proteomically identified antibodies were synthesized and shown to
   display subnanomolar affinities. The ability to deconvolute the
   polyclonal serum response is likely to be of key importance for
   analyzing antibody responses after vaccination and for more completely
   understanding adaptive immune responses in health and disease.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregation kinetics of chiral-specific semiconducting single-walled
   carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was systematically studied through
   time-resolved dynamic light scattering. Varied monovalent (NaCl) and
   divalent (CaCl2) electrolyte composition was used as background solution
   chemistry. Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) was used to study the
   effects of natural organic matter on chirally separated SWNT
   aggregation. Increasing salt concentration and introduction of divalent
   cations caused aggregation of SWNT clusters by suppressing the
   electrostatic repulsive interaction from the oxidized surfaces. The
   (6,5) SWNTs, i.e., SG65, with relatively lower diameter tubes compared
   to (7,6), i.e., SG76, showed substantially higher stability (7- and
   5-fold for NaCl and CaCl2, respectively). The critical coagulation
   concentration (CCC) values were 96 and 13 mM NaCl in the case of NaCl
   and 2.8 and 0.6 mM CaCl2 for SG65 and SG76, respectively. The increased
   tube diameter for (7,6) armchair SWNTs likely presented with higher van
   der Waals interaction and thus increased the aggregation propensity
   substantially. The presence of SRHA enhanced SWNT stability in divalent
   CaCl2 environment through steric interaction from adsorbed humic
   molecules; however showed little or no effects for monovalent NaCl. The
   mechanism of aggregation describing favorable interaction tendencies for
   (7,6) SWNTs is probed through ab initio molecular modeling. The results
   suggest that SWNT stability can be chirality dependent in typical
   aquatic environment.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report simultaneous screening of bimetallic electrocatalyst
   candidates for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) using bipolar
   electrochemistry. The analysis is carried out by dispensing different
   bimetallic precursor compositions onto the cathodic poles of an array of
   bipolar electrodes (BPEs) and then heating them in a reducing atmosphere
   to yield the catalyst candidates. Because BPEs do not require a direct
   electrical connection for activation, up to 33 electrocatalysts can be
   screened simultaneously by applying a voltage to the electrolyte
   solution in which the BPE array is immersed. The screening of the
   electrocatalyst candidates can be achieved in about 10 min. The current
   required to drive the ORR arises from oxidation of Cr microbands present
   at the anodic poles of the BPEs. Therefore, the most effective
   electrocatalysts result in oxidation (dissolution) of the most
   microbands, and simply counting the microbands remaining at the end of
   the screen provides information about the onset potential required to
   reduce oxygen. Here, we evaluated three Pd-M (M = Au, Co, W) bimetallic
   electrocatalysts. In principle, arbitrarily large libraries of
   electrocatalysts can be screened using this approach.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The UBE4B gene, which is located on chromosome 1p36, encodes
   a ubiquitin ligase that interacts with hepatocyte growth
   factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), a protein involved in
   epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking, suggesting a link
   between EGFR trafficking and neuroblastoma pathogenesis. The authors
   analyzed the roles of UBE4B in the outcomes of patients with
   neuroblastoma and in neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation, EGFR
   trafficking, and response to EGFR inhibition. METHODS: The association
   between UBE4B expression and the survival of patients with neuroblastoma
   was examined using available microarray data sets. UBE4B and EGFR
   protein levels were measured in patient tumor samples, EGFR degradation
   rates were measured in neuroblastoma cell lines, and the effects of
   UBE4B on neuroblastoma tumor cell growth were analyzed. The effects of
   the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab were examined in neuroblastoma cells that
   expressed wild-type and mutant UBE4B. RESULTS: Low UBE4B gene expression
   is associated with poor outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma. UBE4B
   overexpression reduced neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation, and UBE4B
   expression was inversely related to EGFR expression in tumor samples.
   EGFR degradation rates correlated with cellular UBE4B levels. Enhanced
   expression of catalytically active UBE4B resulted in reduced sensitivity
   to EGFR inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates
   associations between UBE4B expression and the outcomes of patients with
   neuroblastoma and between UBE4B and EGFR expression in neuroblastoma
   tumor samples. Moreover, levels of UBE4B influence neuroblastoma tumor
   cell proliferation, EGFR degradation, and response to EGFR inhibition.
   These results suggest UBE4B-mediated growth factor receptor trafficking
   may contribute to the poor prognosis of patients who have neuroblastoma
   tumors with 1p36 deletions and that UBE4B expression may be a marker
   that can predict responses of neuroblastoma tumors to treatment. Cancer

Abstract = {{The tumor microenvironment provides unique challenges for the delivery
   of chemotherapeutic agents in doses that are effective while ensuring
   minimal systemic toxicity. The primary limitation of current
   therapeutics is a lack of specificity in delivery, as they target
   healthy and cancerous cells alike. The development of nanoscale carriers
   capable of delivering cancer therapies has the potential to overcome
   both systemic and tumor barriers and provide specific, targeted
   delivery. This review seeks to provide an overview of available
   nanoscale drug carriers by exploring the wide variety of developed
   nanostructures and the most commonly used moieties for targeted
   delivery. Additionally, the use of nanoscale carriers will be motivated
   by examining tumor physiology and the specific barriers present within
   both the tumor microenvironment and systemic delivery. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Temperature and length scale dependence of solvophobic solvation in a
   single-site water-like liquid}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{The temperature and length scale dependence of solvation properties of
   spherical hard solvophobic solutes is investigated in the Jagla liquid,
   a simple liquid that consists of particles interacting via a spherically
   symmetric potential combining a hard core repulsion and a longer ranged
   soft core interaction, yet exhibits water-like anomalies. The results
   are compared with equivalent calculations for a model of a typical
   atomic liquid, the Lennard-Jones potential, and with predictions for
   hydrophobic solvation in water using the cavity equation of state and
   the extended simple point charge model. We find that the Jagla liquid
   captures the qualitative thermodynamic behavior of hydrophobic hydration
   as a function of temperature for both small and large length scale
   solutes. In particular, for both the Jagla liquid and water, we observe
   temperature-dependent enthalpy and entropy of solvation for all solute
   sizes as well as a negative solvation entropy for sufficiently small
   solutes at low temperature. This feature of water-like solvation is
   distinct from the strictly positive and temperature independent enthalpy
   and entropy of cavity solvation observed in the Lennard-Jones fluid. The
   results suggest that, compared to a simple liquid, it is the presence of
   a second thermally accessible repulsive energy scale, acting to
   increasingly favor larger separations for decreasing temperature, that
   is the essential characteristic of a liquid that favors low-density,
   open structures, and models hydrophobic hydration, and that it is the
   presence of this second energy scale that leads to the similarity in the
   behavior of water and the Jagla liquid. In addition, the Jagla liquid
   dewets surfaces of large radii of curvature less readily than the
   Lennard-Jones liquid, reflecting a greater flexibility or elasticity in
   the Jagla liquid structure than that of a typical liquid, a behavior
   also similar to that of water's hydrogen bonding network. The
   implications of the temperature and length scale dependence of solvation
   free energies in water-like liquids are explored with a simple model for
   the aggregation of solvophobic solutes. We show how aggregate stability
   depends upon the size of the aggregate and the size of its constituent
   solutes, and we relate this dependence to cold-induced destabilization
   phenomena such as the cold-induced denaturation of proteins. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The translational self-diffusion coefficients (D-T) for a series of
   tetra-alkyl acyclic ammonium and cyclic pyrrolidinium ionic liquids
   (ILs) were measured using H-1 pulse field gradient (PFG) NMR
   spectroscopy over various temperatures. These NMR diffusion results were
   combined with previously measured rotational diffusion coefficients
   (D-R) obtained from N-14 NMR relaxation measurements for the same ILs
   (Alam, T. M.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2011, 115, 4307-4316). The D-T/D-R
   ratio was then used to estimate the effective hydrodynamic radius and
   corresponding volumes without the need to directly measure the
   viscosities of the ILs. The generality, validity, and performance of
   using this D-T/D-R ratio is discussed and compared to the effective
   hydrodynamic volumes obtained using classic D-T/viscosity and
   D-R/viscosity relationships. The temperature variation observed for the
   molecular volumes obtained using the D-T/D-R ratio is argued to be a
   signature for the breakdown or decoupling of the Stokes-Einstein and
   Stoke-Einstein-Debye relationships in these neat IL systems, consistent
   with recent molecular dynamic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of cobalt-phthalocyanine (CoPc) molecules
   adsorbed on Ag(100) is investigated by photoemission spectroscopy. The
   results are compared to first-principles electronic structure
   calculations, based on many-body perturbation theory in the GW
   approximation. The photoemission data, obtained from both multilayer and
   monolayer films of CoPc, show that charge transfer occurs between the
   first molecular layer and the metal surface. Varying the photon energy,
   to tune the photoionization cross sections, reveals that the
   charge-transfer-related interface states mainly involve the Co 3d atomic
   orbitals of the Co central atom. GW calculations for the neutral CoPc
   molecule and its anion compare well with the experimental observations
   for a multilayer and a monolayer CoPc film, respectively. They confirm
   the major role played by the Co atom in the charge-transfer process and
   elucidate the complex energy rearrangement of the molecular electronic
   levels upon metal adsorption. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.87.075407}},

Title = {{Activation of Aluminum as an Effective Reducing Agent by Pitting
   Corrosion for Wet-chemical Synthesis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Metallic aluminum (Al) is of interest as a reducing agent because of its
   low standard reduction potential. However, its surface is invariably
   covered with a dense aluminum oxide film, which prevents its effective
   use as a reducing agent in wet-chemical synthesis. Pitting corrosion,
   known as an undesired reaction destroying Al and is enhanced by anions
   such as F-, Cl-, and Br- in aqueous solutions, is applied here for the
   first time to activate Al as a reducing agent for wet-chemical synthesis
   of a diverse array of metals and alloys. Specifically, we demonstrate
   the synthesis of highly dispersed palladium nanoparticles on carbon
   black with stabilizers and the intermetallic Cu-2 Sb/C, which are
   promising candidates, respectively, for fuel cell catalysts and
   lithium-ion battery anodes. Atomic hydrogen, an intermediate during the
   pitting corrosion of Al in protonic solvents (e. g., water and ethylene
   glycol), is validated as the actual reducing agent.}},

Title = {{Regional Structural and Biomechanical Alterations of the Ovine Main

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The engineering foundation for novel approaches for the repair of
   congenital defects that involve the main pulmonary artery (PA) must rest
   on an understanding of changes in the structure-function relationship
   that occur during postnatal maturation. In the present study, we
   quantified the postnatal growth patterns in structural and biomechanical
   behavior in the ovine PA in the juvenile and adult stages. The biaxial
   mechanical properties and collagen and elastin fiber architecture were
   studied in four regions of the PA wall, with the collagen recruitment of
   the medial region analyzed using a custom biaxial mechanical-multiphoton
   microscopy system. Circumferential residual strain was also quantified
   at the sinotubular junction and bifurcation locations, which delimit the
   PA. The PA wall demonstrated significant mechanical anisotropy, except
   in the posterior region where it was nearly isotropic. Overall, we
   observed only moderate changes in regional mechanical properties with
   growth. We did observe that the medial and lateral locations experience
   a moderate increase in anisotropy. There was an average of about 24\%
   circumferential residual stain present at the luminal surface in the
   juvenile stage that decreased to 16\% in the adult stage with a
   significant decrease at the bifurcation, implying that the PA wall
   remodels toward the bifurcation with growth. There were no measurable
   changes in collagen and elastin content of the tunica media with growth.
   On average, the collagen fiber recruited more rapidly with strain in the
   adult compared to the juvenile. Interestingly, the PA thickness remained
   constant with growth. When this fact is combined with the observed
   stable overall mechanical behavior and increase in vessel diameter with
   growth, a simple Laplace Law wall stress estimate suggests an increase
   in effective PA wall stress with postnatal maturation. This observation
   is contrary to the accepted theory of maintenance of homeostatic stress
   levels in the regulation of vascular function and suggests alternative
   mechanisms regulate postnatal somatic growth. Understanding the
   underlying mechanisms, incorporating important structural features
   during growth, will help to improve our understanding of congenital
   defects of the PA and lay the basis for functional duplication in their
   repair and replacement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an updated and augmented version of the Wissler
   human thermoregulation model that has been developed continuously over
   the past 50 years. The existing Fortran code is translated into C with
   extensive embedded commentary. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been
   developed in Python to facilitate convenient user designation of input
   and output variables and formatting of data presentation. Use of the
   code with the GUI is described and demonstrated. New physiological
   elements were added to the model to represent the hands and feet,
   including the unique vascular structures adapted for heat transfer
   associated with glabrous skin. The heat transfer function and efficacy
   of glabrous skin is unique within the entire body based on the capacity
   for a very high rate of blood perfusion and the novel capability for
   dynamic regulation of blood flow. The model was applied to quantify the
   absolute and relative contributions of glabrous skin flow to
   thermoregulation for varying levels of blood perfusion. The model also
   was used to demonstrate how the unique features of glabrous skin blood
   flow may be recruited to implement thermal therapeutic procedures. We
   have developed proprietary methods to manipulate the control of glabrous
   skin blood flow in conjunction with therapeutic devices and simulated
   the effect of these methods with the model.}},

Title = {{Transient wall pressures in an overexpanded and large area ratio nozzle}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Surveys of the fluctuating wall pressure were conducted on a sub-scale
   parabolic-contour rocket nozzle to infer an understanding of the flow
   and shock structure pattern during fixed and transient operations of the
   nozzle. During start-up, the nozzle is highly overexpanded, which
   results in unsteady wall pressure signatures driven by shock foot
   unsteadiness. Wall pressure data are first analyzed using spatial
   Fourier transformations to extract the azimuthal modes during various
   operating states. A timefrequency analysis of the temporal azimuthal
   mode coefficients is then used to characterize the time-dependent
   spectral behavior of the wall pressure signatures during start-up. For
   both fixed and transient operations of the nozzle, the axisymmetric
   breathing mode (m = 0) comprises most of the resolved energy. As for the
   transient operations alone, slight deviations in ramp rate are shown to
   considerably influence the amount of unsteadiness that the nozzle wall
   is exposed to, even though the general spectral and temporal features
   remain similar. In particular, increased ramp rates result in increased
   wall pressure intensity. Secondly, three major low-frequency events (f
   less than or similar to 400 Hz) were observed during start-up and are
   attributed to: (1) FSS -> RSS transition, (2) the passing of the
   reattachment line from the first separation bubble, and (3) the `
   end-effects regime'. The last of these refers to a condition where a
   trapped separation bubble opens intermittently to ambient at the nozzle
   lip.}},

Abstract = {{Gene therapy is the modification of gene expression to treat a disease.
   However, efficient intracellular delivery and monitoring of gene
   therapeutic agents is an ongoing challenge. Use of theranostic agents
   with suitable targeted, controlled delivery and imaging modalities has
   the potential to greatly advance gene therapy. Inorganic nanoparticles
   including magnetic nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and quantum dots
   have been shown to be effective theranostic agents for the delivery and
   spatiotemporal tracking of oligonucleotides in vitro and even a few
   cases in vivo. Major concerns remain to be addressed including
   cytotoxicity, particularly of quantum dots; effective dosage of
   nanoparticles for optimal theranostic effect; development of real-time
   in vivo imaging; and further improvement of gene therapy efficacy. (C)

   storage}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{445-453}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel technique for solving a dynamic optimal chiller loading problem
   is presented. This method reduces the complexity of the dynamic problem
   by considering all chillers to be a single, optimal chiller, which
   significantly reduces the number of decision variables. A static optimal
   chiller loading problem is solved as a sub-problem to give the optimal
   total power required at each time interval. The static optimization
   problem is solved by choosing the best solution from a series of convex
   quadratic programming problems, thus ensuring global optimality at each
   time interval. This hierarchical structure takes advantage of the extra
   degrees of freedom provided by thermal energy storage, while effectively
   breaking the problem down into a much simpler problem.
   This methodology is applied to a district cooling system in Austin, TX.
   Results are compared for three operating strategies: equal ratio chiller
   loading, static optimal chiller loading with no storage, and dynamic
   optimal chiller loading with storage. The problem is solved with two
   different objective functions: to minimize total energy consumption and
   to minimize total cost over a 24-h time horizon. The results show energy
   savings as high as 9.4\% and cost savings as high as 17.4\% when
   applying a conservative time-of-use pricing structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Gas transport parameters and X-ray computed tomography (CT) measurements
   in porous medium under controlled and identical conditions provide a
   useful methodology for studying the relationships among them, ultimately
   leading to a better understanding of subsurface gaseous transport and
   other soil physical processes. The objective of this study was to
   characterize the relationships between gas transport parameters and
   soil-pore geometry revealed by X-ray CT. Sands of different shapes with
   a mean particle diameter (d(50)) ranging from 0.19 to 1.51 mm were used
   as porous media under both air-dried and partially saturated conditions.
   Gas transport parameters including gas dispersivity (alpha), diffusivity
   (D-P/D-0), and permeability (k(a)) were measured using a unified
   measurement system (UMS). The 3DMA-Rock computational package was used
   for analysis of three-dimensional CT data. A strong linear relationship
   was found between alpha and tortuosity calculated from gas transport
   parameters (T-UMS = root epsilon.D-O/D-P), indicating that gas
   dispersivity has a linear and inverse relationship with gas diffusivity.
   A linear relationship was also found between k(a) and d(50)/T-UMS(2),
   indicating a strong dependency of k(a) on mean particle size and direct
   correlation with gas diffusivity. Tortuosity (T-MFX) and equivalent pore
   diameter (d(eq.MFX)) analyzed from microfocus X-ray CT increased
   linearly with increasing d(50) for both Granusil and Accusand and
   further showing no effect of particle shape. The T-UMS values showed
   reasonably good agreement with T-MFX values. The k(a) showed a strong
   relationship when plotted against d(eq.MFX)/T-MFX(2), indicating its
   strong dependency on pore size distribution and tortuosity of pore
   space.}},

Abstract = {{Many wireless data communication systems such as LTE, and Wi-Fi, are
   increasingly facing interference that is much stronger than thermal
   noise. Interference may arise due to dense spatial reuse of spectrum
   intended to increase user data rates, or from other devices emitting
   radiation in the same spectrum, or from electronic circuitry within the
   communication platform. For a multi-antenna receiver operating in an
   interference-limited channel, we evaluate four diversity combining
   algorithms in terms of outage probability in the low-outage regime. The
   contributions of this paper are (1) derivation of closed-form
   expressions for the output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) statistics
   of fixed weight, maximal ratio, selection and post-detection combining;
   (2) comparison of the relative outage performance of these algorithms;
   and (3) proposed diversity combining algorithms to reduce outage
   probability. Our results can be applied in analyzing the outage
   performance and throughput capacity of both centralized and
   decentralized interference-limited wireless networks.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Interference alignment is a revolutionary wireless transmission strategy
   that reduces the impact of interference. The idea of interference
   alignment is to coordinate multiple transmitters so that their mutual
   interference aligns at the receivers, facilitating simple interference
   cancellation techniques. Since interference alignment's inception,
   researchers have investigated its performance and proposed several
   improvements. Research efforts have been primarily focused on verifying
   interference alignment's ability to achieve the maximum degrees of
   freedom (an approximation of sum capacity), developing algorithms for
   determining alignment solutions, and designing transmission strategies
   that relax the need for perfect alignment but yield better performance.
   This article provides an overview of the concept of interference
   alignment as well as an assessment of practical issues including
   performance in realistic propagation environments, the role of channel
   state information at the transmitter, and the practicality of
   interference alignment in large networks.}},

Abstract = {{Multicell cooperation may play an important role in achieving high
   performance in cellular systems. Multicell cooperation with a single
   receive antenna at the mobile station has been widely investigated.
   Applying cooperation with multiple receive antennas, allowed in several
   emerging wireless standards, has met with some challenges. This is
   primarily because the transmit precoding/beamforming vector and receive
   processing have to be jointly optimized in multiple cells to combat
   out-of-cell interference. In this article, we first discuss the role of
   the receive antennas in a multicell environment, and then review
   recently proposed multicell cooperative algorithms and receive antenna
   techniques for different interference statistics. Finally, we highlight
   recent work on the fundamental limits of cooperation and the possibility
   of overcoming such limits by using multiple receive antennas in
   multicell cooperative networks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents the second phase of a three-phase research effort
   to develop and deploy best practices for project security on industrial
   construction projects. Specifically, it details the development and
   interpretation and initial validation of the security rating index,
   which provides a means of quantitatively assessing the level of
   implementation of security practices for a project. The security rating
   index must be used in the context of threat and consequence levels. The
   threat level quantifies the intention and capability of an adversary to
   undertake detrimental actions, whereas the consequence level quantifies
   potential impacts of a security breach over the facility life cycle.
   This approach allows comparisons to be made between projects with
   similar security considerations. The security rating index is the first
   tool to integrate and quantify risk, consequence, and security best
   practice implementation. It can also be used as a checklist to integrate
   the appropriate security measures in the early phases of project
   planning. Once sufficient data are available, the security rating index
   will provide a means by which companies can gauge the level of security
   integration of their own projects against similar projects within the
   industry. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000591. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{An adequate evaluation of stress developments in concrete is essential
   to ensure well-performing and long-lasting portland cement concrete
   (PCC) pavement designs and construction. In this study, the effects of
   creep and built-in curling (BIC) on the stress history of PCC pavements
   under environmental loadings were investigated primarily through a
   series of field tests and numerical data interpretations. To identify
   the stress-dependent strain component within the in situ measured total
   strain, a nonstress cylinder (NC) was employed in the field tests. The
   identified stress-dependent strains from the field tests were converted
   to stresses using a step-by-step numerical method. To investigate the
   effect of creep on stress developments, stress histories were computed
   in two different ways-one with elastic analysis and the other with
   viscoelastic analysis-and then their difference (stress relaxation) over
   time was evaluated. The finding indicated that creep may be a key
   element in the evaluation of long-term stresses and, in turn, the design
   and analysis of PCC pavements. Furthermore, this study examined the
   impacts of BIC on the residual stresses of PCC pavements. The result
   showed that BIC may affect the early-age stress development, but it has
   little influence on the long-term environmental stress state. DOI:

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative visualization of nanoparticles in cells and tissues, while
   preserving the spatial information, is very challenging. A photoacoustic
   imaging technique to depict the presence and quantity of nanoparticles
   is presented. This technique is based on the dependence of the
   photoacoustic signal on both the nanoparticle quantity and the laser
   fluence. Quantitative photoacoustic imaging is a robust technique that
   does not require knowledge of the local fluence, but a relative change
   in the fluence. This eliminates the need for sophisticated methods or
   models to determine the energy distribution of light in turbid media.
   Quantitative photoacoustic imaging was first applied to
   nanoparticle-loaded cells, and quantitation was validated by inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Quantitative photoacoustic imaging was
   then extended to xenograft tumor tissue sections, and excellent
   agreement with traditional histopathological analysis was demonstrated.
   Our results suggest that quantitative photoacoustic imaging may be used
   in many applications including the determination of the efficiency and
   effectiveness of molecular targeting strategies for cell studies and
   animal models, the quantitative assessment of photoacoustic contrast
   agent biodistribution, and the validation of in vivo photoacoustic
   imaging.}},

Abstract = {{An ultralow interfacial tension alkali-surfactant-polymer formulation

   (and the same surfactant formulation) if the alkaline preflush was used.
   The oil recovery in the out-crop core with the alkaline preflush was
   94\%. Alkaline preflush increases the core salinity to the optimum

Abstract = {{Parallelizing dense matrix computations to distributed memory
   architectures is a well-studied subject and generally considered to be
   among the best understood domains of parallel computing. Two packages,
   developed in the mid 1990s, still enjoy regular use: ScaLAPACK and
   PLAPACK. With the advent of many-core architectures, which may very well
   take the shape of distributed memory architectures within a single
   processor, these packages must be revisited since the traditional
   MPI-based approaches will likely need to be extended. Thus, this is a
   good time to review lessons learned since the introduction of these two
   packages and to propose a simple yet effective alternative. Preliminary
   performance results show the new solution achieves competitive, if not
   superior, performance on large clusters.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of candidate wells for refracturing is often very
   difficult to peforrn based on the information available at the surface.
   We propose a systematic methodology to allow a field engineer to
   evaluate a well's potential for refracturing from an analysis of
   field-production data and other reservoir data commonly available. The
   well-selection method was successfully confronted to a case study in the
   Wattenberg field using data from 300 Code 11 tight gas wells.
   The performance of refracturing treatments has been observed to be
   highly variable in the Wattenberg field (Colorado), with some wells
   underperforming while others are restored to initial or even higher
   production rates. Historically, multiple approaches have been taken to
   select the best candidate wells, including heuristic guidelines, field
   correlations, and neural networks.
   After identifying the physical phenomena that are thought to impact the
   performance of refracturing operations, five dimensionless groups were
   developed to quantify them. By choosing a dimensionless approach, the
   goal is to establish refracturing criteria that will not limited to one
   specific field, but may used in distinct oil and gas fields. One
   potential motivation for refracturing is the stress reorientation
   occurring around a fractured well, causing the refracture to propagate
   orthogonally to the initial fracture in underdepleted sections of the
   reservoir. Numerical simulations of the areal extent of the
   stress-reversal region as well as tiltmeter measurements confirmed the
   existence of refracture reorientation in the Code 11 formation.
   Guidelines for the selection of refracturing candidates were expressed
   in terms of the potential for stress reorientation, the quality of the
   initial completion, the initial production decline, and the reservoir
   depletion around the well of interest. Two groups of wells showed the
   most promise for refracturing: (a) ineffective initial completions with
   a small initial production decline and (b) long initial fractures in
   underdepleted reservoirs. The dimensionless groups help us identify such
   wells and provide quantitative criteria for selection of wells that may
   be good candidates for refracturing.}},

Abstract = {{Glycans anchored to residue N297 of the antibody IgG Fc domain are
   critical in mediating binding toward Fc gamma Rs to direct both adaptive
   and innate immune responses. However, using a full length bacterial IgG
   display system, we have isolated aglycosylated Fc domains with mutations
   that confer up to a 160-fold increase in the affinity toward the low
   affinity Fc gamma RIIa-R131 allele as well as high selectivity against
   binding to the remarkably homologous human inhibitory receptor, Fc gamma
   RIIb. The mutant Pc domain (AglycoT-Fc1004) contained a total of 5 amino
   acid substitutions that conferred an activating to inhibitory ratio of
   25 (A/I ratio; FcyRIIa-R131:Fc gamma RIIb). Incorporation of this
   engineered Fc into trastuzumab, an anti-Her2 antibody, resulted in a
   75\% increase in tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages compared to that
   of the parental glycosylated trastuzumab with both medium and low
   Her2-expressing cancer cells. A mathematical model has been developed to
   help explain how receptor affinity and the A/I ratio relate to improved
   antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. Our model provides
   guidelines for the future engineering of Fc domains with enhanced
   effector function.}},

Abstract = {{Variant rs2200733 on Chromosome 4q25 Confers Increased
   Risk.Introduction: Several genome-wide association studies have
   identified rs2200733, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at 4q25 to
   be the most common chromosomal variant present in patients with atrial
   fibrillation (AF). We aimed to explore the association of rs2200733 with
   AF through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Method: An extensive
   literature search was performed on PubMed, and other databases using the
   key words genetics and AF. Seven case-control studies evaluating the
   association via multivariate analysis were identified including a total
   of 83,335 subjects (10,546 with AF, 72,789 referent individuals without
   AF). Meta-analytic estimates were derived using random effects models.
   Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in sensitivity
   analyses, and publication biases were estimated. Result: At pooled
   analysis, there was a strong independent association between the variant
   rs2200733 and the risk of AF (OR 1.89 {[}95\% CI 1.622.16], P < 0.001).
   Minor allelic frequencies for SNP rs22000733 were significantly more
   prevalent in AF population than non-AF. Metaregression results revealed
   that country of descent (logOR 0.38, P = 0.45) or site of study (logOR:
   0.16, P = 0.41) did not moderate the overall effect size. Conclusion:
   Variant rs2200733 on chromosome 4q25 independently confers increased
   risk of AF. This finding will aid in improving our understanding of AF
   pathophysiology, risk prediction, and stratification of treatment
   strategy. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 24, pp. 155-161, February

Abstract = {{The growth of bilayer and multilayer graphene on copper foils was
   studied by isotopic labeling of the methane precursor. Isotope-labeled
   graphene films were characterized by micro-Raman mapping and
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Our investigation shows
   that during growth at high temperature, the adlayers formed
   simultaneously and beneath the top, continuous layer of graphene and the
   Cu substrate. Additionally, the adlayers share the same nucleation
   center and all adlayers nucleating in one place have the same edge
   termination. These results suggest that adlayer growth proceeds by
   catalytic decomposition of methane (or CHx, x < 4) trapped in a
   ``nano-chemical vapor deposition{''} chamber between the first layer and
   the substrate. On the basis of these results, submillimeter bilayer
   graphene was synthesized by applying a much lower growth rate.}},

Abstract = {{To utilize high-capacity Si anodes in next-generation Li-ion batteries,
   the physical and chemical transformations during the Li-Si reaction must
   be better understood. Here, in situ transmission electron microscopy is
   used to observe the lithiation/delithiation of amorphous Si nanospheres;
   amorphous Si is an important anode material that has been less studied
   than crystalline Si. Unexpectedly, the experiments reveal that the first
   lithiation occurs via a two-phase mechanism, which is contrary to
   previous understanding and has important consequences for mechanical
   stress evolution during lithiation. On the basis of kinetics
   measurements, this behavior is suggested to be due to the rate-limiting
   effect of Si-Si bond breaking. In addition, the results show that
   amorphous Si has more favorable kinetics and fracture behavior when
   reacting with Li than does crystalline Si, making it advantageous to use
   in battery electrodes. Amorphous spheres up to 870 nm in diameter do not
   fracture upon lithiation; this is much larger than the 150 nm critical
   fracture diameter previously identified for crystalline Si spheres.}},

Abstract = {{Each B-cell receptor consists of a pair of heavy and light chains.
   High-throughput sequencing can identify large numbers of heavy- and
   light-chain variable regions (V-H and V-L) in a given B-cell repertoire,
   but information about endogenous pairing of heavy and light chains is
   lost after bulk lysis of B-cell populations. Here we describe a way to
   retain this pairing information. In our approach, single B cells (>5 x
   10(4) capacity per experiment) are deposited in a high-density microwell
   plate (125 pl/well) and lysed in situ. mRNA is then captured on magnetic
   beads, reverse transcribed and amplified by emulsion V-H:V-L linkage
   PCR. The linked transcripts are analyzed by Illumina high-throughput
   sequencing. We validated the fidelity of V-H:V-L pairs identified by
   this approach and used the method to sequence the repertoire of three
   human cell subsets-peripheral blood IgG(+) B cells, peripheral
   plasmablasts isolated after tetanus toxoid immunization and memory B
   cells isolated after seasonal influenza vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the potential of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer
   nanocomposites (TPUNs) as alternative elastomeric heat shielding
   materials (EHSMs) in ablative applications. Three different nanofillers
   were tested - montmorillonite clay (MMT clay), multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes (MWNTs), and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) - and formulations were
   made for each material with a range of weight loadings. Small scale
   ablation testing was performed using an oxyacetylene test bed and
   Kevlar-filled EPDM as the baseline EHSM. Mass loss, recession, and char
   thickness values were measured in addition to in situ internal
   temperatures. The TPUN formulations with 5 and 7.5 wt\% MMT clay showed
   the best results, outperforming the baseline in recession and peak
   temperature values. SEM images of the char from MMT clay containing
   TPUNs showed ablative re-assembly, which likely served to enhance the
   material performance. Overall, results showed that the TPUN ablatives
   performed well relative to the baseline EHSM. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of flexible shift scheduling of service
   employees at mail processing and distribution centers. Our main
   objective is to determine staffing levels for different worker
   categories subject to a host of union restrictions and general labor
   regulations. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program
   and solved with branch and price algorithm. Using real data provided by
   a US Postal Service a variety of computational experiments are performed
   to quantify the benefits of scheduling flexibility. These include
   different shift starting times, different shift lengths, a lunch break
   allowance, and different days-off assignments. In addition, the ratio
   between regular and flexible workers is varied to investigate its effect
   on costs. The results show the efficiency of the proposed procedure.
   Finally, we offer some managerial insights gained from the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic shear rheometer is again used to characterize the nonlinearly
   viscoelastic properties of asphalt binders at intermediate or high
   temperatures. In our previous work, the dynamic shear rheometer test
   results showed that, under certain conditions, a compressive normal
   force was generated in an axially constrained specimen subjected to
   cyclic torque histories. This normal force could not be solely
   attributed to the Poynting effect and was also related to the tendency
   of the asphalt binder to dilate when subjected to shear loads. The
   generated normal force changed the state of stress and interacted with
   the shear behavior of asphalt binder. This effect was considered to be
   an ``interaction nonlinearity{''} or ``three-dimensional effect.{''} The
   concept is explored further in this paper by developing a fundamental
   approach to modeling the observed behavior. In this approach, the
   octahedral shear stress is used to represent the three-dimensional
   stress state in Schapery's model of nonlinearly viscoelastic behavior.
   The model was successfully validated for several different loading
   histories. These results highlight the importance of modeling the
   mechanical behavior of asphalt binders based on the three-dimensional
   stress state of the material.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of symmetry between electric and magnetic charges, a
   fundamental consequence of the small value of the fine-structure
   constant(1), is directly related to the weakness of magnetic effects in
   optical materials(2,3). Properly tailored plasmonic nanoclusters have
   been proposed recently to induce artificial optical magnetism(4-7) based
   on the principle that magnetic effects are indistinguishable from
   specific forms of spatial dispersion of permittivity at optical
   frequencies(1). In a different context, plasmonic Fano resonances have
   generated a great deal of interest, particularly for use in sensing
   applications that benefit from sharp spectral features and extreme field
   localization(8-12). In the absence of natural magnetism, optical Fano
   resonances have so far been based on purely electric effects. In this
   Letter, we demonstrate that a subwavelength plasmonic metamolecule
   consisting of four closely spaced gold nanoparticles supports a strong
   magnetic response coupled to a broad electric resonance. Small
   structural asymmetries in the assembled nanoring enable the interaction
   between electric and magnetic modes, leading to the first observation of
   a magnetic-based Fano scattering resonance at optical frequencies. Our
   findings are supported by excellent agreement with simulations and
   analytical calculations, and represent an important step towards the
   quest for artificial magnetism and negative refractive index
   metamaterials at optical frequencies(13-15).}},

Title = {{On modeling telecommuting behavior: option, choice, and frequency}},

Abstract = {{The current study contributes to the already substantial scholarly
   literature on telecommuting by estimating a joint model of three
   dimensions-option, choice and frequency of telecommuting. In doing so,
   we focus on workers who are not self-employed workers and who have a
   primary work place that is outside their homes. The unique
   methodological features of this study include the use of a general and
   flexible generalized hurdle count model to analyze the precise count of
   telecommuting days per month, and the formulation and estimation of a
   model system that embeds the count model within a larger multivariate
   choice framework. The unique substantive aspects of this study include
   the consideration of the ``option to telecommute{''} dimension and the
   consideration of a host of residential neighborhood built environment
   variables. The 2009 NHTS data is used for the analysis, and allows us to
   develop a current perspective of the process driving telecommuting
   decisions. This data set is supplemented with a built environment data
   base to capture the effects of demographic, work-related, and built
   environment measures on the telecommuting-related dimensions. In
   addition to providing important insights for policy analysis, the
   results in this paper indicate that ignoring the ``option{''} dimension
   of telecommuting can, and generally will, lead to incorrect conclusions
   regarding the behavioral processes governing telecommuting decisions.
   The empirical results have implications for transportation planning
   analysis as well as for the worker recruitment/retention and
   productivity literature.}},

Title = {{Optimal reconfigurations of two-craft Coulomb formations along manifolds}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{108-118}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Coulomb formations refer to swarms of closely flying spacecraft, in
   which the net electric charge of each vehicle is controlled. Active
   charge control is central to this concept and enables a propulsion
   system with highly desirable characteristics, albeit with limited
   controllability. Numerous Coulomb formation equilibria have been
   derived, but to maintain and maneuver these configurations, some
   inertial thrust is required to supplement the nearly propellant-less
   charge control. In this work, invariant manifold theory is applied to
   two-craft Coulomb equilibria, which are admitted in a linearized
   two-body gravity model. The manifolds associated with these systems are
   analyzed for the first time, and are then utilized as part of a general
   procedure for formulating optimal reconfigurations. Specifically,
   uncontrolled flows along the manifolds are sought which provide near
   continuous transfers from one equilibrium to another. Control is then
   introduced to match continuity, while minimizing inertial thrusting.
   This methodology aims to exploit uncontrolled motions and charge control
   to realize the shape-changing ability of these formations, without large
   inertial control efforts. Some variations in formulating and
   parameterizing the optimal transfers are discussed, and analytical
   expressions are derived to aid in establishing control parameter limits,
   under certain assumptions. Numerical results are provided, as
   demonstrative examples of the optimization procedure, using relatively
   simple control approximations. Finally, Particle Swarm Optimization, a
   novel stochastic method, is used with considerable success to solve the
   numerically difficult parameter optimization problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recently, digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have revolutionized many
   biochemical laboratory procedures and received much attention due to
   their many advantages, such as high throughput, automatic control, and
   low cost. To meet the challenges of increasing design complexity,
   computer-aided-design (CAD) tools have been used to build DMFBs
   efficiently. Current CAD tools generally conduct a two-stage based
   design flow of fluidic-level synthesis followed by chip-level design to
   optimize fluidic behaviors and chip architecture separately.
   Nevertheless, existing fluidic-chip design gap will become even wider
   with a rapid escalation in the number of assay operations incorporated
   into a single DMFB. As more and more large-scale assay protocols are
   delivered in the current emerging marketplace, this problem may
   potentially restrict the effectiveness and feasibility of the entire
   DMFB realization and thus needs to be solved quickly. In this paper, we
   propose the first fluidic-chip co-design methodology for DMFBs to
   effectively bridge the fluidic-chip design gap. Our work provides a
   comprehensive integration throughout fluidic-operation scheduling, chip
   layout generation, control pin assignment, and wiring solution to
   achieve higher design performance and feasibility. Experimental results
   show the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of our co-design
   methodology on a set of real-life assay applications.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally recognized that severe video distortions that are

   several video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms on videos suffering
   from compression and lossy transmission over communication channels. We
   propose a content adaptive spatial and temporal pooling strategy based
   on the observed distribution. Our method adaptively emphasizes
   ``worst{''} scores along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of a
   video sequence and also considers the perceptual effect of large-area
   cohesive motion flow such as egomotion. We demonstrate the efficacy of
   the method by testing it using three different VQA algorithms on the

Abstract = {{Production yield in semiconductor wafer fabrication is directly affected
   by low levels of molecular contamination of the silicon wafer surface.
   Wafers are often carried in specialized plastic enclosures, called front
   opening unified pods, that are continuously purged with a nitrogen flow
   to minimize wafer surface contamination. To improve this purge process,
   it is necessary to better understand the effect of mass transfer
   transport and kinetic processes on the silicon wafer surfaces. The
   experimental surface kinetics data available in the literature for
   diethyl phthalate were utilized, along with a validated computational
   fluid dynamics model to predict the relative magnitude of the time
   scales associated with transport and kinetics. The transport time was
   found to be considerably shorter than the characteristic adsorption
   time, and the desorption characteristic time was longer than the
   adsorption time. In general, surface kinetics parameters are not always
   known. Among other techniques, optimization techniques can be employed
   to calibrate the kinetic rate parameters. A multi-hierarchical model
   optimization technique can then be used to infer surface kinetics rates
   using experimentally measured concentration data for amine contamination

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the inferential use of goodness of fit tests in a
   non-parametric setting. The utility of such tests will be demonstrated
   for the test case of spectrum sensing applications in cognitive radios.
   We provide the first comprehensive framework for decision fusion of an
   ensemble of goodness-of-fit testing procedures through an Ensemble
   Goodness-of-Fit test. Also, we introduce a generalized family of
   functionals and kernels called Phi-divergences which allow us to
   formulate goodness-of-fit tests that are parameterized by a single
   parameter. The performance of these tests is simulated under Gaussian
   and non-Gaussian noise in a MIMO setting. We show that under uncertainty
   in the noise statistics or non-Gaussianity in the noise, the performance
   of non-parametric tests in general, and phi-divergence based
   goodness-of-fit tests in particular, is significantly superior to that
   of the energy detector with reduced implementation complexity. In
   particular, the false alarm rates of our proposed tests is maintained at
   a fixed level over a wide variation in the channel noise distributions.
   Additionally, we describe a collaborative spatially separated version of
   the test for robust combining of tests in a distributed spectrum sensing
   setting and quantify the significant collaboration gains achieved.}},

   makes it similar to a q-analog of a transversal design. The structure of
   these designs is used to obtain upper bounds on the sizes of constant

Abstract = {{This paper presents a built-in self repair analyzer with the optimal
   repair rate for memory arrays with redundancy. The proposed method
   requires only a single test, even in the worst case. By performing the
   must-repair analysis on the fly during the test, it selectively stores
   fault addresses, and the final analysis to find a solution is performed
   on the stored fault addresses. To enumerate all possible solutions,
   existing techniques use depth first search using a stack and a
   finite-state machine. Instead, we propose a new algorithm and its
   combinational circuit implementation. Since our formulation for the
   circuit allows us to use the parallel prefix algorithm, it can be
   configured in various ways to meet area and test time requirements. The
   total area of our infrastructure is dominated by the number of content
   addressable memory entries to store the fault addresses, and it only
   grows quadratically with respect to the number of repair elements. The
   infrastructure is also extended to support various types of

Title = {{Improved Trace Buffer Observation via Selective Data Capture Using 2-D

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel technique for extending the capacity of
   trace buffers when capturing debug data during post-silicon debug. It
   exploits the fact that is it not necessary to capture error-free data in
   the trace buffer since that information can be obtained from simulation.
   A selective data capture method is proposed in this paper that only
   captures debug data during clock cycles in which errors are present. The
   proposed debug method requires only three debug sessions. The first
   session estimates a rough error rate, the second session identifies a
   set of suspect clock cycles where errors may be present, and the third
   session captures the suspect clock cycles in the trace buffer. The
   suspect clock cycles are determined through a 2-D compaction technique
   using multiple-input signature register signatures and cycling register
   signatures. Intersecting both signatures generates a small number of
   suspect clock cycles for which the trace buffer needs to capture. The
   effective observation window of the trace buffer can be expanded
   significantly, by up to orders of magnitude. Experimental results
   indicate very significant increases in the effective observation window
   for a trace buffer can be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Upon swelling in a solvent, a thin hydrogel layer on a rigid substrate
   may become unstable, developing various surface patterns. Recent
   experimental studies have explored the possibilities to generate
   controllable surface patterns by chemically modifying the molecular
   structures of the hydrogel near the surface. In this paper, we present a
   theoretical stability analysis for swelling of hydrogel layers with
   material properties varying in the thickness direction. As a
   specialization of the general procedure, hydrogel bilayers with
   different combinations of the material properties are examined in
   details. For a soft-on-hard bilayer, the onset of surface instability is
   determined by the short-wave limit, similar to a homogeneous layer. In
   contrast, for a hard-on-soft bilayer, a long-wave mode with a finite
   wavelength emerges as the critical mode at the onset of surface
   instability, similar to wrinkling of an elastic thin film on a
   compliant. substrate, and the critical swelling ratio is much lower than
   that for a homogeneous hydrogel layer. A smooth transition of the
   critical mode is predicted as the volume fraction of the top layer
   changes, linking surface instability of a homogeneous layer to thin film
   wrinkling as two limiting cases. The results from the present study
   suggest that both the critical condition and the instability mode depend
   sensitively on the variation of the material properties in the thickness
   direction of the hydrogel layer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FIRE PROTECTION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-75}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The major factors that impact residential fire losses and casualties are
   relatively well known both on the national level and for any given
   state. Interestingly, relatively little has been done in comparing fire
   loss data between states. If state fire loss data are compared, one
   should be able to identify contributing factors that influence
   differences in fire losses between states. As an example, it is known
   that construction standards, regulatory policy, socio-economic factors,
   etc. all influence the frequency and severity of fires. In this study,
   subsets of National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) data for the
   two largest US states by population are studied in order to identify how
   areas of origin, items first ignited, and heat sources contribute to the
   odds of casualties or fatalities occurring in fires, as well as to
   examine differences between the two states for these three factors. Data
   on residential home fires from 2006 to 2010 were gathered from the Texas
   and California NFIRS databases, Texas Fire Incident Reporting System and
   California All Incident Reporting System, respectively, for this
   purpose. Examination of the datasets separately using logistic
   regression models emphasized that fires started in the living room or
   den, fires in which the item first ignited was a flammable liquid,
   piping, or filter, and fires that were initiated from cigarettes, pipes,
   and cigars, all have significantly high odds of resulting in both
   casualties and fatalities for both states. Additionally, logistic
   regression modeling with interactions between state and area of origin,
   item first ignited, and heat source indicated that for many categories,
   the odds of a fire resulting in a casualty in Texas is roughly 1.5 times
   higher than the same fire in California.}},

Abstract = {{Stereological analysis has been coupled with transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) orientation mapping to investigate the grain boundary

   the nanosized (<5 nm) beam in the TEM for collecting spot diffraction

   the scanning electron microscope. Electron beam precession is used to
   reduce dynamical effects and increase the reliability of orientation
   solutions. The misorientation distribution function shows a strong
   misorientation texture with a peak at 60 degrees/{[}111], corresponding
   to the Sigma 3 misorientation. The grain boundary plane distribution
   shows \{111\} as the most frequently occurring plane, indicating a
   significant population of coherent twin boundaries. This study

Abstract = {{We review recent work (Briedt et al., 2011, 2012) on a new approach to
   the formulation and solution of the stochastic inverse parameter
   determination problem, i.e. determine the random variation of input
   parameters to a map that matches specified random variation in the
   output of the map, and then apply the various aspects of this method to
   the interesting Brusselator model. In this approach, the problem is
   formulated as an inverse problem for an integral equation using the Law
   of Total Probability. The solution method employs two steps: (1) we
   construct a systematic method for approximating set-valued inverse
   solutions and (2) we construct a computational approach to compute a
   measure-theoretic approximation of the probability measure on the input
   space imparted by the approximate set-valued inverse that solves the
   inverse problem. In addition to convergence analysis, we carry out an a
   posteriori error analysis on the computed probability distribution that
   takes into account all sources of stochastic and deterministic error.

Abstract = {{We couple collocated isogeometric boundary element methods and
   unstructured analysis-suitable T-spline surfaces for linear elastostatic
   problems. We extend the definition of analysis-suitable T-splines to
   encompass unstructured control grids (unstructured meshes) and develop
   basis functions which are smooth (rational) polynomials defined in terms
   of the Bezier extraction framework and which pass standard patch tests.
   We then develop a collocation procedure which correctly accounts for
   sharp edges and corners, extraordinary points, and T-junctions. This
   approach is applied to several three-dimensional problems, including a
   real-world T-spline model of a propeller. We believe this work clearly
   illustrates the power of combining new analysis-suitable computer aided
   design technologies with established analysis methodologies, in this
   case, the boundary element method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Volumetric PIV and 2D OH PLIF imaging in the far-field of a low Reynolds
   number nonpremixed jet flame}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cinematographic stereoscopic PIV with temporal and spatial resolution
   ranging from 2.6 to 5.5 Kolmogorov scales, which is sufficient to
   accurately represent most of the dissipation structures, is used in
   conjunction with Taylor's frozen flow hypothesis to generate
   quasi-instantaneous pseudo-volumes of the three-component velocity field
   in the far-field of a nonpremixed jet flame at the jet exit Reynolds
   number (Re-d) of 8000. The 3D data enable the computation of the nine
   components of the velocity gradient tensor and other important kinematic
   quantities. The volumetric PIV is combined with single-shot simultaneous
   OH PLIF imaging to mark the instantaneous reaction zone at one plane in
   the reconstructed volume. The combined datasets enable the investigation
   of the relationship between the reaction zone and the fully-3D
   representations of strain, vorticity, kinetic energy dissipation and
   dilatation, and of the impact of heat release on the structure of
   turbulence. In this Re-d = 8000 flame, it is observed that sheet-like
   layers of vorticity and dissipation tend to coincide and are aligned
   with the OH layers, an effect that is believed to be due to the
   stabilizing effect of heat release on this relatively low Reynolds
   number jet flame. Furthermore, the spatial organization of the strain
   field is predominantly driven by the presence of the flame rather than
   turbulence. Finally, intense dissipation is mostly due to the laminar
   shear caused by the presence of the flame rather than to the strain
   generated by vortical structures as typically observed in nonreacting
   jets.}},

Abstract = {{We derive new trace inequalities for NURBS-mapped domains. In addition
   to Sobolev-type inequalities, we derive discrete trace inequalities for
   use in NURBS-based isogeometric analysis. All dependencies on shape,
   size, polynomial degree, and the NURBS weighting function are precisely
   specified in our analysis, and explicit values are provided for all
   bounding constants appearing in our estimates. As hexahedral finite
   elements are special cases of NURBS, our results specialize to
   parametric hexahedral finite elements, and our analysis also generalizes
   to T-spline-based isogeometric analysis. We compare the bounding
   constants appearing in our explicit trace inequalities with numerically
   computed optimal bounding constants, and we discuss application of our
   results to a Laplace problem. We finish this paper with a brief
   exploration of so-called patch-wise trace inequalities for isogeometric

Title = {{A parallel ensemble-based framework for reservoir history matching and

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-97}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We present a parallel framework for history matching and uncertainty
   characterization based on the Kalman filter update equation for the
   application of reservoir simulation. The main advantages of
   ensemble-based data assimilation methods are that they can handle
   large-scale numerical models with a high degree of nonlinearity and
   large amount of data, making them perfectly suited for coupling with a
   reservoir simulator. However, the sequential implementation is
   computationally expensive as the methods require relatively high number
   of reservoir simulation runs. Therefore, the main focus of this work is
   to develop a parallel data assimilation framework with minimum changes
   into the reservoir simulator source code. In this framework, multiple
   concurrent realizations are computed on several partitions of a parallel
   machine. These realizations are further subdivided among different
   processors, and communication is performed at data assimilation times.
   Although this parallel framework is general and can be used for
   different ensemble techniques, we discuss the methodology and compare
   results of two algorithms, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the
   ensemble smoother (ES). Computational results show that the absolute
   runtime is greatly reduced using a parallel implementation versus a
   serial one. In particular, a parallel efficiency of about 35 \% is
   obtained for the EnKF, and an efficiency of more than 50 \% is obtained
   for the ES.}},

Abstract = {{Although there has been a large research effort associated with
   individual parts of various algal biofuel production pathways, few
   studies have tracked changes in product composition throughout an
   integrated biofuel production process. This study uses microscopy and
   chromatography to analyze the progression of lipid profile and cell
   structure of algal cells throughout a research-scale production pathway
   for biocrude. For the specific processing methods used in this pathway,
   it is shown that TAG content decreased, while DAG and FFA content
   increased during processing. The changes in the lipid content
   corresponded to cell degradation that was observed by SEM and TEM
   throughout processing. These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of
   lipid composition in an algal culture used for biofuel production and
   emphasize the need to monitor changes in lipid profile, as those changes
   can directly impact biofuel productivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A comprehensive scheme is described to construct rational trivariate
   solid T-splines from boundary triangulations with arbitrary topology. To
   extract the topology of the input geometry, we first compute a smooth
   harmonic scalar field defined over the mesh, and saddle points are
   extracted to determine the topology. By dealing with the saddle points,
   a polycube whose topology is equivalent to the input geometry is built,
   and it serves as the parametric domain for the trivariate T-spline. A
   polycube mapping is then used to build a one-to-one correspondence
   between the input triangulation and the polycube boundary. After that,
   we choose the deformed octree subdivision of the polycube as the initial
   T-mesh, and make it valid through pillowing, quality improvement and
   applying templates to handle extraordinary nodes and partial
   extraordinary nodes. The T-spline that is obtained is C-2-continuous
   everywhere over the boundary surface except for the local region
   surrounding polycube corner nodes. The efficiency and robustness of the
   presented technique are demonstrated with several applications in
   isogeometric analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of hydrophilic/CO2-philic balance (HCB) was extended to
   describe stabilization of carbon dioxide-in-water (C/W) foams (also
   called emulsions) with silica nanoparticles adsorbed at the CO2-water
   interface. Opaque, white C/W foams (bubble diameter <100 mu m) were
   generated with either PEG-coated silica or methylsilyl modified silica
   nanoparticles in a beadpack with CO2 densities between 0.2 and 0.9 g
   mL(-1). For methylsilyl modified silica nanoparticles, 50\% SiOH
   modification provided an optimal HCB for generation and stabilization of
   viscous C/W foams with high stability. The apparent viscosity measured
   with a capillary tube viscometer reached 120-fold that of a CO2-water
   mixture without nanoparticles, a consequence of the small bubble size
   and the energy required to deform a high density of aqueous lamellae
   between CO2 bubbles. Air-in-water (A/W) foams stabilized with
   nanoparticles were used to gain insight into the relationship between
   nanoparticle surface properties and adsorption of the nanoparticles at
   various types of interfaces. With suitable nanoparticles, A/W foams were
   stable for at least 7 days and C/W foams were stable for at least 23 h.
   The ability to achieve long term stability for nanoparticle stabilized
   C/W foams could offer an alternative to conventional surfactants, which
   are known to have much lower adsorption energies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{The Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery: A Perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1167-1176}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Each cell of a battery stores electrical energy as chemical energy in
   two electrodes, a reductant (anode) and an oxidant (cathode), separated
   by an electrolyte that transfers the ionic component of the chemical
   reaction inside the cell and forces the electronic component outside the
   battery. The output on discharge is an external electronic current I at
   a voltage V for a time Delta t. The chemical reaction of a rechargeable
   battery must be reversible on the application of a charging I and V.
   Critical parameters of a rechargeable battery are safety, density of
   energy that can be stored at a specific power input and retrieved at a
   specific power output, cycle and shelf life, storage efficiency, and
   cost of fabrication. Conventional ambient-temperature rechargeable
   batteries have solid electrodes and a liquid electrolyte. The positive
   electrode (cathode) consists of a host framework into which the mobile
   (working) cation is inserted reversibly over a finite solid solution
   range. The solid solution range, which is reduced at higher current by
   the rate of transfer of the working ion across electrode/electrolyte
   interfaces and within a host, limits the amount of charge per electrode
   formula unit that can be transferred over the time Delta t = Delta t(I).
   Moreover, the difference between energies of the LUMO and the HOMO of
   the electrolyte, i.e., electrolyte window, determines the maximum
   voltage for a long shelf and cycle life. The maximum stable voltage with
   an aqueous electrolyte is 1.5 V; the Li-ion rechargeable battery uses an
   organic electrolyte with a larger window, which increase the density of
   stored energy for a given Delta t. Anode or cathode electrochemical
   potentials outside the electrolyte window can increase V, but they
   require formation of a passivating surface layer that must be permeable
   to Li+ and capable of adapting rapidly to the changing electrode surface
   area as the electrode changes volume during cycling. A passivating
   surface layer adds to the impedance of the Li+ transfer across the
   electrode/electrolyte interface and lowers the cycle life of a battery
   cell. Moreover, formation of a passivation layer on the anode robs Li
   from the cathode irreversibly on an initial charge, further lowering the
   reversible Delta t. These problems plus the cost of quality control of
   manufacturing plague development of Li-ion rechargeable batteries that
   can compete with the internal combustion engine for powering electric
   cars and that can provide the needed low-cost storage of electrical
   energy generated by renewable wind and/or solar energy. Chemists are
   contributing to incremental improvements of the conventional strategy by
   investigating and controlling electrode passivation layers, improving
   the rate of Li+ transfer across electrode/electrolyte interfaces,
   identifying electrolytes with larger windows while retaining a Li+
   conductivity sigma(Li) > 10(-3) S cm(-1), synthesizing electrode
   morphologies that reduce the size of the active particles while pinning
   them on current collectors of large surface area accessible by the
   electrolyte, lowering the cost of cell fabrication, designing
   displacement-reaction anodes of higher capacity that allow a safe, fast
   charge, and designing alternative cathode hosts. However, new strategies
   are needed for batteries that go beyond powering hand-held devices, such
   as using electrode hosts with two-electron redox centers; replacing the
   cathode hosts by materials that undergo displacement reactions (e.g.
   sulfur) by liquid cathodes that may contain flow-through redox
   molecules, or by catalysts for air cathodes; and developing a solid
   electrolyte separator membrane that allows an organic and aqueous liquid
   electrolyte on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Opportunities
   exist for the chemist to bring together oxide and polymer or graphene
   chemistry in imaginative morphologies.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular membranes are densely crowded with a diverse population of
   integral and membrane-associated proteins. In this complex environment,
   lipid rafts, which are phase-separated membrane domains enriched in
   cholesterol and saturated lipids, are thought to organize the membrane
   surface. Specifically, rafts may help to concentrate proteins and lipids
   locally, enabling cellular processes such as assembly of caveolae,
   budding of enveloped viruses, and sorting of lipids and proteins in the
   Golgi. However, the ability of rafts to concentrate protein species has
   not been quantified experimentally. Here we show that when
   membrane-bound proteins become densely crowded within liquid-ordered
   membrane regions, steric pressure arising from collisions between
   proteins can destabilize lipid phase separations, resulting in a
   homogeneous distribution of proteins and lipids over the membrane
   surface. Using a reconstituted system of lipid vesicles and recombinant
   proteins, we demonstrate that protein-protein steric pressure creates an
   energetic barrier to the stability of phase-separated membrane domains
   that increases in significance as the molecular weight of the proteins
   increases. Comparison with a simple analytical model reveals that
   domains are destabilized when the steric pressure exceeds the
   approximate enthalpy of membrane mixing. These results suggest that a
   subtle balance of free energies governs the stability of phase-separated
   cellular membranes, providing a new perspective on the role of lipid
   rafts as concentrators of membrane proteins.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most common medical interventions to reopen an occluded
   vessel is the implantation of a coronary stent. While this method of
   treatment is effective initially, restenosis, or the re-narrowing of the
   artery frequently occurs largely due to neointimal hyperplasia of smooth
   muscle cells. Drug eluting stents were developed in order to provide
   local, site-specific, controlled release of drugs that can inhibit
   neointima formation. By implementing a controlled release delivery
   system it may be possible to control the time release of the
   pharmacological factors and thus be able to bypass some of the critical
   events associated with stent hyperplasia and prevent the need for
   subsequent intervention. However, since the advent of first-generation
   drug eluting stents, long-term adverse effects have raised concerns
   regarding their safety. These limitations in safety and efficacy have
   triggered considerable research in developing biodegradable stents and
   more potent drug delivery systems. In this review, we shed light on the
   current state-of-the-art in drug eluting stents, problems related to
   them and highlight some of the ongoing research in this area. (C) 2012

Title = {{Large Domain Motions in Ago Protein Controlled by the Guide DNA-Strand
   Seed Region Determine the Ago-DNA-mRNA Complex Recognition Process}},

Abstract = {{The recognition mechanism and cleavage activity of argonaute (Ago),
   miRNA, and mRNA complexes are the core processes to the small non-coding
   RNA world. The 59 nucleation at the `seed' region (position 2-8) of
   miRNA was believed to play a significant role in guiding the recognition
   of target mRNAs to the given miRNA family. In this paper, we have
   performed allatom molecular dynamics simulations of the related and
   recently revealed Ago-DNA: mRNA ternary complexes to study the dynamics
   of the guide-target recognition and the effect of mutations by
   introducing ``damaging{''} C? C mismatches at different positions in the
   seed region of the DNA-RNA duplex. Our simulations show that the
   A-form-like helix duplex gradually distorts as the number of seed
   mismatches increases and the complex can survive no more than two such
   mismatches. Severe distortions of the guide-target heteroduplex are
   observed in the ruinous 4-sites mismatch mutant, which give rise to a
   bending motion of the PAZ domain along the L1/L2 ``hinge-like{''}
   connection segment, resulting in the opening of the nucleic-acid-binding
   channel. These long-range interactions between the seed region and PAZ
   domain, moderated by the L1/L2 segments, reveal the central role of the
   seed region in the guide-target strands recognition: it not only
   determines the guide-target heteroduplex's nucleation and propagation,
   but also regulates the dynamic motions of Ago domains around the
   nucleic-acid-binding channel.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{879-889}},

Abstract = {{Replacing batteries with fuel cells is a promising approach for powering
   portable devices; however, hydrogen fuel generation and storage are
   challenges to the acceptance of this technology. A potential solution to
   this problem is on-site fuel reforming, in which a rich fuel/air mixture
   is converted to a hydrogen-rich syngas. In this paper, we present
   experimental results of the conversion of jet fuel (Jet-A) and butanol
   to syngas by non-catalytic filtration combustion in a porous media
   reactor operating over a wide range of equivalence ratios and inlet
   velocities. Since the focus of this study is the production of syngas,
   our primary results are the hydrogen yield, the carbon monoxide yield,
   and the energy conversion efficiency. In addition, the production of
   soot that occurred during testing is discussed for both fuels. Finally,
   an analysis of the potential for these fuels and others to be converted
   to syngas based on the present experiments and data available in the
   literature is presented. This study is intended to increase the
   understanding of filtration combustion for syngas production and to
   illuminate the potential of these fuels for conversion to syngas by
   non-catalytic methods. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

   oxide/natural rubber nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{166-172}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Thermally-exfoliated graphite oxide (TEGO) is a graphene-based material
   that has been previously shown to disperse effectively into
   thermoplastic polymers by melt processing. In this work, dispersion of
   TEGO into natural rubber (NR) directly on a two-roll mill did not result
   in substantial property enhancement. However, by pre-mixing the TEGO
   with NR latex by an ultrasonically-assisted latex co-coagulation
   procedure followed by two-roll milling, the properties were improved
   substantially over the TEGO/NR nanocomposites mixed only on the mill.
   Quantitative analysis of TEM micrographs suggested the difference in
   properties was primarily the result of improved dispersion, as fewer
   multi-layer tactoids and platelets of overall smaller dimensions were
   observed in the nanocomposites pre-mixed by latex co-coagulation. NR
   filled with carbon black showed comparable property enhancement to
   TEGO/NR mixed on the two-roll mill but much smaller property changes
   than the latex pre-mixed TEGO/NR nanocomposites. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Physical aging of polystyrene films tracked by gas permeability}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{873-880}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Most studies using gas permeation to characterize physical aging in thin
   polymer films have focused on polymers of interest as membrane
   materials, such as polysulfone (PSF) and Matrimid. Many other physical
   aging studies, using techniques other than gas permeation, focus on
   polystyrene (PS). In this work, physical aging in bulk PS films and
   PDMS-coated thin PS films was studied using well-established gas
   permeation techniques. The similar to 400 nm PS films aged slightly
   faster than bulk PS. However, the difference between rates of aging in
   thin and thick films was much less than that reported in PSF and
   Matrimid films of similar thicknesses. The similar to 800 nm films aged
   in a manner generally similar to bulk PS. Comparison of the normalized
   oxygen permeability of similar to 400 nm films of PS, PSF, and Matrimid
   revealed that a similar to 400 nm PS film experiences a slower decline
   in relative permeability than a PSF or Matrimid film does. Unlike what
   has been observed previously in studies of PSF and Matrimid films, PS
   films do not appear to show aging behavior that is strongly dependent on
   film thickness or highly accelerated relative to bulk. Because it would
   be difficult to use the results of PS aging studies to predict the aging
   behavior of typical gas separation polymers, we suggest that PS is not a
   good model for the aging behavior of commercially useful gas separation
   membrane materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The glass-rubber and sub-glass relaxation characteristics of

   Soluble polyimides (HAB-6FDA; APAF-ODPA) were synthesized by chemical
   and thermal imidization and subject to thermal rearrangement at elevated
   temperature. For the thermal exposure histories investigated, mass loss
   studies indicated partial conversion of the polyimide precursor,
   suggesting the formation of TR copolymers containing both benzoxazole
   units and residual imide segments. Measurement of storage modulus and
   loss tangent was used to follow the thermal rearrangement process
   in-situ as reflected in the suppression of the polyimide glass
   transition as a function of precursor structure, the nature of the ortho
   functional groups and prior thermal exposure. In addition, changes in
   the position and intensity of local relaxations detected across the
   sub-glass temperature range were correlated with the degree of thermal
   rearrangement in these polymers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Material surface engineering has attracted great interest in important
   applications, including electronics, biomedicine, and membranes. More
   recently, dopamine has been widely exploited in solution-based chemistry
   to direct facile surface modification. However, unsolved questions
   remain about the chemical identity of the final products, their
   deposition kinetics and their binding mechanism. In particular, the
   dopamine oxidation reaction kinetics is a key to improving surface
   modification efficiency. Here, we demonstrate that high O-2
   concentrations in the dopamine solution lead to highly homogeneous, thin
   layer deposition on any material surfaces via accelerated reaction
   kinetics, elucidated by Le Chatelier's principle toward dopamine
   oxidation steps in a Michael-addition reaction. As a result, highly
   uniform, ultra-smooth modified surfaces are achieved in much shorter
   deposition times. This finding provides new insights into the effect of
   reaction kinetics and molecular geometry on the uniformity of
   modifications for surface engineering techniques.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Aluminum-Neutralized Sulfonated Styrenic Pentablock

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1056-1068}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Suspension-phase neutralization of an acid-form sulfonated styrenic
   pentablock copolymer was used to prepare aluminum cross-linked polymer
   films. Aluminum neutralization was confirmed by Al-27 solid state NMR,
   and the aluminum-neutralized polymer resisted ion exchange to the sodium
   counterion form when the polymer was soaked in 1 mol/L sodium chloride
   for 30 days. The effects of aluminum neutralization on polymer
   morphology, mechanical properties, water and salt transport properties,
   and free volume were explored. The primary spacing of the morphology, as
   measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), decreased upon
   neutralization of the sulfonated polymer. The hydrated
   aluminum-neutralized polymer was mechanically stronger than the
   non-neutralized polymer, but the dry aluminum-neutralized polymer was
   more brittle than the non-neutralized polymer. Neutralization of the
   polymer's sulfonic acid functionality resulted in a 5.5-fold decrease in
   water uptake. This water uptake decrease upon aluminum neutralization
   resulted in a decrease, relative to the non-neutralized polymer, in
   water and sodium chloride permeability and water vapor transport rate.
   These decreases in transport rates and water uptake were consistent with
   one another, based on an analysis of changes in free volume of the
   material upon aluminum neutralization. Sodium chloride permeability of
   the aluminum-neutralized polymer was less dependent on salt
   concentration than that of the non-neutralized polymer, which is
   consistent with neutralization of the polymer's charged sulfonate
   groups. Aluminum neutralization increased the polymer's water/sodium
   chloride permeability selectivity because of a 1.8-fold increase in the
   material's diffusion selectivity. Free volume element size,
   characterized by ortho-positronium lifetime, decreased upon aluminum
   neutralization in both dry and hydrated film samples.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its highly inflammatory nature, LPS is a molecule with
   remarkable therapeutic potential. Lipid A is a glycolipid that serves as
   the hydrophobic anchor of LPS and constitutes a potent ligand of the
   Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4/myeloid differentiation factor 2 receptor of
   the innate immune system. A less toxic mixture of monophosphorylated
   lipid A species (MPL) recently became the first new Food and Drug
   Administration-approved adjuvant in over 70 y. Whereas wild-type
   Escherichia coli LPS provokes strong inflammatory MyD88 ( myeloid
   differentiation primary response gene 88)-mediated TLR4 signaling, MPL
   preferentially induces less inflammatory TRIF (TIR-domain-containing
   adaptor-inducing IFN-beta)-mediated responses. Here, we developed a
   system for combinatorial structural diversification of E. coli lipid A,
   yielding a spectrum of bioactive variants that display distinct TLR4
   agonist activities and cytokine induction. Mice immunized with
   engineered lipid A/antigen emulsions exhibited robust IgG titers,
   indicating the efficacy of these molecules as adjuvants. This approach
   demonstrates how combinatorial engineering of lipid A can be exploited
   to generate a spectrum of immunostimulatory molecules for vaccine and
   therapeutics development.}},

Abstract = {{Multiphoton lithography (MPL) is a highly versatile strategy for
   creating 3D microscale objects with complex geometrical arrangements,
   including nested boxes, interlocking blocks, and braided threads. Of the
   various chemistries used to produce solid forms in MPL, protein
   photocrosslinking has been of particular value in biological
   applications, yielding materials with high porosity, tunable elasticity,
   and a diverse set of chemical and biochemical properties. Unfortunately,
   the potential for object drift, and consequent distortion, during this
   direct-write process has required that microforms be constructed in
   integral contact with an immobile surface, precluding fabrication of
   protein-based objects that retain rotational and translational degrees
   of freedom. Here, the development of a high-viscosity protein-based
   reagent that can be used to fabricate complex 3D microstructures that
   are not adhered to a surface, including chains of Mobius strips,
   paddlewheels, and unconstrained (free-floating) probes for bacterial

Abstract = {{A homologous series of Au coated iron oxide nanoparticles with
   hydrodynamic diameters smaller than 60 nm was synthesized with very low
   Au-to-iron mass ratios, as low as 0.15. The hydrodynamic diameter was
   determined by dynamic light scattering and the composition by atomic
   absorption spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy.
   Unusually low Au precursor supersaturation levels were utilized to
   nucleate and grow Au coatings on iron oxide relative to the formation of
   pure Au nanoparticles. This approach produced unusually thin coatings by
   lowering autocatalytic growth of Au on Au, as shown by transmission
   electron microscopy. Nearly all of the nanoparticles were attracted by a
   magnet, indicating a minimal number of pure Au particles. The coatings
   were sufficiently thin to shift the surface plasmon resonance to the
   near infrared with large extinction coefficients, despite the small
   particle hydrodynamic diameters observed from dynamic light scattering
   to be less than 60 nm.}},

Abstract = {{We present a liquid-solid heterogeneous synthesis with switchable
   etching effects to prepare highly dispersed, PdPt surface enriched
   PdPtCu alloy nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon black (PdPtCu/C) by
   using Cu NPs as a heterogeneous reducing agent. A mixture of the Pd and
   Pt precursors and nanosized particles of Cu are required to form the
   highly dispersed PdPtCu alloy NPs and scatter them on the carbon black.
   Oxidative etching of the surface Cu with the reaction solution triggered
   by switching the reaction solution atmosphere from N-2 to air results in
   an enrichment of the surface of PdPtCu by PdPt. The activity towards the
   oxygen reduction reaction and methanol tolerance is tuned by controlling
   the Pd/Pt ratio. The PdPtCu/C catalyst with a Pd/Pt molar ratio of 1:1
   exhibits noble metal and Pt mass activities of, respectively, 2 and 3
   times that of a commercial Pt/C at 0.85 V vs. RHE with much superior
   methanol tolerance. It also shows better performance than Pt/C with
   comparable durability in a direct methanol fuel cell. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ratios of noble gas radioisotopes can provide critical information
   with which to verify that a belowground nuclear test has taken place.
   The relative abundance of anthropogenic isotopes is typically assumed to
   rely solely on their fission yield and decay rate. The xenon signature
   of a nuclear test is then bounded by the signal from directly produced
   fission xenon, and by the signal that would come from the addition of
   xenon from iodine precursors. Here we show that this signal range is too
   narrowly defined. Transport simulations were done to span the range of
   geological conditions within the Nevada Test Site. The simulations
   assume a 1 kt test and the barometric history following the nuclear test
   at Pahute Mesa in March 1992. Predicted xenon ratios fall outside of the
   typically assumed range 20\% of the time and situations can arise where
   the ground level signal comes entirely from the decay of iodine
   precursors. Citation: Lowrey, J. D., S. R. Biegalski, A. G. Osborne, and

Abstract = {{Porous materials are of great importance because of their multiple
   applications in pharmacy, catalysis, and biomedicine among others. Ice
   segregation induced self-assembly (ISISA) is a cryogenic technique that
   uses the ice as a template that forms upon immersion of a polymer
   solution into liquid nitrogen to obtain highly porous materials. Some
   highlights of this technique are its versatility, simplicity, and
   control over the final structure of the produced material; besides, no
   organic solvents are used during the process, and the material can be
   used without the need of further cleaning. In this contribution, the
   elaboration of scaffolds using a poly(ethylene glycol) aqueous solutions
   by an ice-template process has been studied from experimental and
   theoretical viewpoints. The experimental study of the process
   parameters, such as immersion velocity and a prescribed freezing front
   on the morphology, was carried out. Simulations were performed to
   understand the ISISA process by calculating temperature profiles and
   pore size as a function of time. The most important result of this study
   was the effect of freezing rate on pore size. The technique was
   optimized such that a recipe is proposed to form materials with 1-100 mu
   m pore sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene ribbon-supported Pd nanoparticles (Pd/GR) have been prepared by
   a simple, clean process in aqueous medium, involving only a Pd precursor
   and graphene ribbon (GR) as both a reducing agent and a catalyst
   support. A high density of Pd nanoparticles with a small average
   particle size (similar to 2.8 +/- 0.8 nm) could be successfully
   deposited on graphene ribbons. The as-obtained Pd/GR electrocatalysts
   show increased electrochemical surface area and significantly enhanced
   catalytic activity for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) compared to
   the conventional Pd/C electrocatalysts in terms of peak current density
   (1.4A mg(-1) vs. 0.79 A mg(-1)) and peak potential (-0.15V shift). Both
   the good dispersion and the relatively small particle size of the Pd
   nanoparticles on graphene ribbon and the synergetic effect between Pd
   and GR lead to high initial catalytic activity for FAOR. More
   importantly, a dramatic enhancement in durability is found with Pd/GR
   for FAOR due to the strong interaction between Pd and GR. (C) 2012

   trimethylaluminum, and water as co-reactants. Reflection high-energy
   electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron
   microscopy were used to determine film crystallinity. The as-deposited
   LAO films were amorphous and became crystalline after vacuum annealing
   at 600 degrees C for 2 h. In-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   was used to characterize the LAO/STO/Si interfaces at various stages
   throughout the growth and annealing process. XPS analysis showed minimal
   Si-O bonding at the STO/Si interface after the ALD process and after
   post-deposition annealing at 600 degrees C for 2 h. The results

   poly(styrene-block-trimethylsilylisoprene) (P(S-b-TMSI)), which has much

   poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate) is reported. A Sakurai,
   Grignard-type coupling reaction provided the key monomer in good yield.
   Living anionic polymerization was employed to prepare the block
   copolymer, which has very low polydispersity. P(S-b-TMSI) was
   successfully ordered and oriented by directed self-assembly. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{We demonstrate intra-and inter-board level optical interconnects using
   polymer waveguides and waveguide couplers consisting of both 45 degree
   total internal reflection (TIR) mirrors and inkjet-printed micro-lenses.
   Surface normal couplers consisting of 50 mu m x 50 mu m waveguides with
   embedded 45 degree mirrors are fabricated using a nickel mold imprint.
   Micro-lenses, 70 mu m in diameter, are inkjet-printed on top of the
   mirrors. We characterize the optical transmission between waveguides
   located on different boards in terms of insertion loss, mirror coupling
   loss, and free space propagation loss as a function of interconnection
   distance in free space. Each mirror contributes 1.88 dB loss to the
   system, corresponding to 65\% efficiency. The printed micro-lenses
   improve the transmission by 2-4 dB (per coupler). Data transmission at
   10 Gbps reveals that inter-board interconnects has a bit error rate
   (BER) of 1.1 x 10(-10) and 6.2 x 10(-13) without and with the
   micro-lenses, respectively. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which play key roles in cell
   signaling and regulation, do not display specific tertiary structure
   when isolated in solution. Instead, they dynamically explore an ensemble
   of unfolded configurations, adopting more stable, ordered structures
   only after binding to their ligands. Whether ligands induce IDP
   structural changes upon binding or simply bind to pre-existing
   conformers that are populated within the IDP's structural ensemble is
   not well understood. Molecular simulations can provide information with
   the spatiotemporal resolution necessary to resolve these issues. Here,
   we report on the conformational ensemble of a 15-residue wild-type p53
   fragment from the TAD domain and its mutant (TAD-P27L) obtained by
   replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation using an optimized (fully
   atomistic, explicit solvent) protein model and the experimental
   validation of the simulation results. We use a clustering method based
   on structural similarity to identify conformer states populated by the
   peptides in solution from the simulated ensemble. We show that p53
   populates solution structures that strongly resemble the ligand
   (MDM2)-bound structure, but at the same time, the conformational
   free-energy landscape is relatively flat in the absence of the ligand.}},

Abstract = {{We have discovered that NO2 is reduced to NO at 77 K by hydrogen

   NO2 to NO on an atomic-hydrogen populated model gold catalyst for a more
   fundamental understanding of the surface chemistry of hydrogenation.
   Gold-based catalysts have been found to be active for many hydrogenation
   reactions, but few related fundamental studies have been conducted. Our
   experimental results reveal a high catalytic activity for gold: indeed,
   NO2 is reduced to NO with 100\% conversion and 100\% selectivity at
   temperatures lower than 120 K. Density functional theory calculations
   and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy measurements indicate
   that HNO2 and N2O3 are intermediates which are highly dependent on
   surface hydrogen concentrations; subsequent hydrogenation of HNO2 and
   dissociation of N2O3 upon annealing induces the production of NO and
   H2O.}},

Abstract = {{The stress-field model introduced in Part 1 is used to analyse the
   effects of rubber particle size D and volume fraction phi on impact
   behaviour. The model is refined by including energy released from the
   matrix during rubber particle cavitation, and interactions between
   cavitated rubber particles, porous shear bands, and crazes, in the later
   stages of energy absorption. The analysis shows that with increasing
   phi, critical stresses for rubber particle cavitation increase slightly,
   while yield stresses and craze formation stresses fall substantially,
   and craze stability increases. Particle morphology and particle-matrix
   adhesion also affect the locations of the brittle-ductile (BD)
   transition, which is caused by cavitation resistance in very small
   particles, and the ductile-brittle (DB) transition, which is due
   essentially to failure of crazes initiated from larger particles.
   Comparisons of model predictions with Izod data provide further insight
   into the ways in which large porous plastic zones develop ahead of notch
   tips. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conformational rearrangements in biomolecules (such as protein folding
   or enzyme-ligand binding) are often interpreted in terms of
   low-dimensional models of barrier crossing such as Kramers' theory.
   Dimensionality reduction, however, entails memory effects; as a result,
   the effective frictional drag force along the reaction coordinate
   nontrivially depends on the time scale of the transition. Moreover, when
   both solvent and ``internal{''} friction effects are important, their
   interplay results in a highly nonlinear dependence of the effective
   friction on solvent viscosity that is not captured by common
   phenomenological models of barrier crossing. Here, these effects are
   illustrated using an analytically solvable toy model of an unstructured
   polymer chain involved in an inter-or intramolecular transition. The
   transition rate is calculated using the Grote-Hynes and Langer theories,
   which-unlike Kramers' theory-account for memory. The resulting effective
   frictional force exerted by the polymer along the reaction coordinate
   can be rationalized in terms of the effective number of monomers engaged
   in the transition. Faster transitions (relative to the polymer
   reconfiguration time scale) involve fewer monomers and, correspondingly,
   lower friction forces, because the polymer chain does not have enough
   time to reconfigure in response to the transition. (C) 2013 American

Title = {{A phenomenological muscle model to assess history dependent effects in

Abstract = {{Most musculoskeletal models used to analyze human movement utilize
   Hill-type muscle models that account for state dependent intrinsic
   muscle properties (e.g., force length velocity relationships), but
   rarely do these models include history dependent effects (e.g., force
   depression or enhancement). While the relationship between muscle
   shortening and force depression can be well characterized by muscle
   mechanical work, the relationship between muscle stretch and force
   enhancement is more complex. Further, it is not well known how these
   properties influence dynamic movements. Therefore, the goal of this
   study was to develop a modified Hill-type muscle model that incorporated
   stretch-induced force enhancement into a previously described model that
   included shortening-induced force depression. The modified muscle model
   was based on experimental data from isolated cat soleus muscles.
   Simulations of in situ muscle experiments were used to validate the
   model and simulations of a simple human movement task (counter-movement
   jumping) were used to examine the interactions of the history dependent
   effects. The phenomenological model of stretch-induced force enhancement
   was dependent on both the magnitude of stretch and relative length of
   the muscle fiber. Simulations of the in situ muscle experiments showed
   that the model could accurately reproduce force enhancement and force
   depression, as well as the complex additive relationship between these
   effects. Simulations of counter-movement jumping showed that a similar
   jump pattern could be achieved with and without history dependent
   effects and that a relatively minor change in muscle activation could
   mitigate the impact of these effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The size of the Last Level Caches (LLC) in multicore architectures is
   increasing, and so is their power consumption. However, most of this
   power is wasted on unused or invalid cache lines. For dirty cache lines,
   the LLC waits until the line is evicted to be written back to memory.
   Hence, dirty lines compete for the memory bandwidth with read requests
   (prefetch and demand), increasing pressure on the memory controller.
   This paper proposes a Dead Line and Early Write-Back Predictor (DEWP) to
   improve the energy efficiency of the LLC. DEWP early evicts dead cache
   lines with an average accuracy of 94\%, and only 2\% false positives.
   DEWP also allows scheduling of dirty lines for early eviction, allowing
   earlier write-backs. Using DEWP over a set of single and multi-threaded
   benchmarks, we obtain an average of 61\% static energy savings, while
   maintaining the performance, for both inclusive and non-inclusive LLCs.}},

Abstract = {{Formation and decomposition of nitroso-piperazine (NNO) compounds were
   studied under conditions pertinent to amine scrubbing. Nitrogen dioxide
   (NO2) has an overall liquid-side mass transfer coefficient of
   approximately 10(-6) mol/Pa.m(2).s at 40 degrees C in 8 m PZ. In an
   amine scrubber designed to remove 90\% CO2, over 90\% of the NO2 will be
   absorbed as nitrite (NO2-) or n-nitrosopiperazine (MNPZ). The NO2- will
   travel to the absorber where it will react with PZ to form MNPZ and
   trace amounts of dinitrosopiperazine (DNPZ). NNO formation is first
   order in NO2-, carbamated amine, and hydronium ions. The NNO will
   thermally decompose in the stripper. Thermal decomposition is first
   order in NNO and dependent on PZ concentration and loading. NNO
   formation from the flue gas NO2 will balance out with NNO thermal
   decomposition to give steady state NNO concentrations. The NNO steady
   state concentration is proportional to the inlet NO2. It is inversely
   proportional to the decomposition rate constant and the volume of the
   stripper sump. An amine scrubber using a flue gas without NOx removal
   will have a steady state MNPZ concentration on the order of 1 mM.
   Reaching the steady state concentration takes on the order of 10 days.
   DNPZ concentration will be on the order of 10(-5) mM, which is
   undetectable using the methods in this work. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Blends using concentrated (25 35 wt \%) piperazine (PZ) were
   characterized as solvents for CO2 capture at typical coal flue gas
   conditions. The new blends are 6 m PZ/2 m hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), 6
   m PZ/2 m diaminobutane (DAB), 6 m PZ/2 m bis(aminoethyl) ether (BAE), 5
   m PZ/2 m aminoethylpiperazine (AEP), and 5 m PZ/2.3 m 2-amino
   2-methyl-propanol (AMP). The CO2 absorption rate of the blends was
   measured using a wetted wall column (WWC). The CO2 vapor liquid
   equilibrium was measured at 20 160 degrees C. Amine vapor pressure
   measurements are reported to show potential volatility at practical
   conditions. The rate of thermal degradation was measured from 135 to 175
   degrees C. Oxidative degradation was measured in two semi-batch
   experiments with different O-2 rate at absorber conditions. Advanced
   parameters are introduced to demonstrate the overall rate and energy
   performance of the solvents in a real process. The performance of 7 m
   MEA, 8 m PZ, and six other competitive PZ blends are evaluated based on
   previous results and presented as basis of comparison.
   All of the PZ blends have better solubility window than 8 m PZ, with no
   precipitation at rich loading. The absorption rate of the concentrated
   PZ blends is similar to that of 8 m PZ and 1.5-2 times higher than 7 m
   MEA; the solvent capacity is about 20\% lower than 8 m PZ and 15\%
   higher than 7 m MEA. Among all of the PZ blends, 5 m PZ/5 m MDEA has the
   best combination of rate and capacity. Blends using HMDA, AEP, BAE, AMP,
   and MEA have a high heat of CO2 absorption. Blends using MEA, MDEA, and
   AMP are not thermally stable, while other blends have good thermal
   stability. The combination of high H-abs and thermal stability leads to
   good overall energy performance, which is observed for 6 m PZ/2 m HMDA,
   6 m PZ/2 m BAE and 5 m PZ/2 m AEP. AMP has relatively high volatility,
   whereas BAE and AEP are expected to have low volatilities. The only
   drawback of 6 m PZ/2 m BAE is its high oxidation rate. 6 m PZ/2 m HMDA
   and 6 m PZ/2 m DAB have good oxidative stability.
   PZ blends using low viscosity amines will have high absorption rate, and
   tertiary and hindered amines will contribute to high capacity. Amines
   with high pKa will improve the blend H-abs. For thermal stability,
   alkanolamines should not be used together with PZ. Highly viscous blends
   such as 6 m PZ/2 m HMDA are expected to have 10-20\% higher cost
   associated with cross-exchanger design and operation than solvents with
   low viscosity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The absorption rate and CO2 solubility of four new blends using
   concentrated piperazine (PZ) were measured. The blends are 6 m PZ/2 m
   hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), 6 m PZ/2 m diaminobutane (DAB), 6 m PZ/2 m
   bis(aminoethyl) ether (BAE), and 5 m PZ/2 m N-2(aminoethy) lpiperazine
   (AEP). The liquid film mass transfer coefficient (k(g)') of the blends
   was measured at 20-100 degrees C using a wetted wall column (WWC).
   P-CO2{*} was measured at 20-100 degrees C using the WWC, and at 100-160
   degrees C using a total pressure apparatus. A semi-empirical VLE model
   was regressed for each blend using measured P-CO2{*}, and the models
   show good agreement with experimental data. The process performance of
   the new blends is compared to 5 m PZ/2.3 m AMP, 2 m PZ/4 m AMP, 8 m PZ,
   and 7 m MEA. The high pKa of primary diamines contributes to high lean
   and rich loading and low solvent capacity for 6 m PZ/2 m HMDA, 6 m PZ/2
   m DAB, 6 m PZ/2 m BAE. The Delta H-abs of PZ/AEP and PZ/AMP is
   competitive with 7 m MEA. PZ/BAE and PZ/HMDA have Delta H-abs higher
   than 8 m PZ but lower than 7 m MEA. The energy performance of the
   solvent depends on CO2 VLE and thermal stability. 6 m PZ/2 m HMDA, 6 m
   PZ/2 m AEP, and 5 m PZ/2 m BAE show good energy performance and are
   competitive with 8 m PZ. At 40 degrees C the absorption rate of 5 m PZ/2
   m AEP is about the same as 8 m PZ; 6 m PZ/2 m DAB and 6 m PZ/2 m BAE
   have 10\% lower rates than 8 m PZ. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Piperazine (PZ) has shown good potential for use as a solvent for CO2
   absorption in post-combustion carbon capture {[}1]. It has a high
   absorption rate {[}2], good capacity {[}3], and very good resistance to
   thermal and oxidative degradation {[}4]. Thermodynamic and kinetic
   models for PZ-CO2-water have been developed in Aspen Plus (R) {[}5].
   Pilot scale experiments were conducted on a 0.1 MW scale at the
   Separations Research Program at UT Austin to demonstrate the performance
   of concentrated (8 m) PZ using an intercooled absorber and a two-stage
   flash. This paper describes modeling and simulation of CO2 stripping
   from PZ using data from two pilot campaigns conducted in Winter and Fall
   2011.
   Vapor liquid equilibrium equations and thermodynamic models for this
   system were validated using pilot plant data and found to satisfactorily
   represent the actual operating conditions. Rigorous reconciliation was
   done on Fall 2011 data using Aspen Plus (R) Data Fit. The only major
   systematic adjustments were found in the CO2 measurements, which
   required 1.2 to 6.9\% increase to match the predicted model values.
   The best equivalent work was 45.5 kJ/mol CO2 in Winter 2011 and 36.6
   kJ/mol CO2 in Fall 2011. The validated model predicted that the pilot
   plant stripper configuration should be able to achieve 32.6 kJ/mol at
   its optimum operating conditions. Major parameters that affected pilot
   plant performance were low values of rich loading and non-optimal
   operation of lean loading and cold rich bypass. Optimized values of
   operating conditions at 0.4 rich loading were identified as 0.31 lean
   ldg and 4\% cold rich bypass flow. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{An equimolar diamine blend of 4 m 2-methylpiperazine (2MPZ) with 4 m
   piperazine (PZ) is shown to be an attractive solvent for CO2 capture.
   This blend overcomes the difficulties posed by the narrow solid
   solubility window of pure 8 m PZ while preserving its benefits. The
   solid solubility window at 20 degrees C broadens from P-CO2({*}) = 0.01
   to P-CO2({*}) = 0.011. As the blend viscosity is nearly double that of
   pure PZ, normalizing the capacity by viscosity shows a practical
   capacity comparable to MEA at 0.63 mol CO2/ kg solvent. The CO2
   absorption rate of the blend is lower, with at k(g,avg)' = 7.1 x 10(7)
   mol/s . Pa . m(2) at 40 degrees C, 84\% that of PZ. The heats of CO2
   absorption of the blend and PZ are equal at Delta H-abs = -70 kJ/mol.
   While the blend thermal stability is decreased, T-max = 155 compared to
   163 degrees C, oxidative stability is similar. Lastly, their
   volatilities are nearly equal with amine Henry's constant near 23 Pa at
   40 degrees C. In short, the equimolar blend of 4 m 2MPZ with 4 m PZ is a
   competitive solvent for amine scrubbing. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Concentrated (40 wt \%) piperazine (PZ) with two-stage flash
   regeneration is an advanced second generation amine-based process for
   CO2 capture. Two pilot campaigns with the two-stage flash process were
   completed in 2011 and successfully demonstrated high temperature
   stripping at 150 degrees C with concentrated piperazine. Data
   reconciliation for the absorber with intercooling return spray was
   completed using Aspen Plus (R) Data-Fit. Data reconciliation for the
   two-stage flash with warm rich bypass was completed using Aspen Plus (R)
   Data-Fit and a dynamic model developed in MATLAB (R). The results of
   data reconciliation analysis found that the CO2 loading in the lean and
   rich streams needed to be systematically shifted upward, 4.6-4.7 \% in
   the stripper analysis and 7.5\% in the absorber analysis.
   An analysis of the October 2011 campaign pilot plant data identified the
   two configurations with the lowest equivalent work as the high
   temperature two-stage flash with warm rich bypass and low pressure
   simple stripper. The calculated equivalent work for the two-stage flash
   with warm rich bypass from raw pilot plant data and reconciled pilot
   plant data is approximately 35 kJ/mol CO2 and 36.6 kJ/mol CO2,
   respectively. Intercooling with a spray return improved absorber CO2
   removal performance by 6-7\% at the lower gas rates and was found to be
   equivalent to a 720\% increase in packing height based on reconciled
   data results. Warm rich bypass to the low pressure flash tank reduced
   piperazine volatility by factor of two in the condensate. In addition,
   analysis of the pilot plant piperazine inventory at the end of the
   campaign identified the following degradation products (mmol/kg):
   N-formyl PZ (1.3), ethylenediamine (13), aminoethylpiperazine (3.6),
   Hydroxyethylpiperazine (3.9), formate (1.0), and N-nitrosopiperazine
   (0.09). The solvent analysis also found that the CO2 capacity has
   decreased by 17\%, with a slight decrease in CO2 absorption rate and
   heat of vaporization. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   negative effect on energy consumption. PZ/AEP also shows a milder

   novel configurations were tested: (1) interheated stripper, (2)
   two-stage flash with cold rich bypass, and (3) two-stage flash with cold
   rich bypass and a low temperature adiabatic flash. Generally, increasing
   the complexity improved process performance, but in some cases the
   improvements were too marginal to justify the additional capital cost.
   Configuration 3 has the added benefit of removing entrained oxygen

   its energy performance is very sensitive to operating conditions. This
   paper also describes the creation of a thermodynamic, hydraulic, and
   kinetic model in Aspen Plus (R) that predicts experimental data for 8 m

Abstract = {{Controlling emission of gaseous and aerosolized pollutants is a critical
   function of CO2 capture systems using aqueous amine solvents. Absorption
   of species into aerosols suspended within flue gas, not mechanical
   entrainment, has been identified as a dominant volatile discharge route.
   This work investigated the effects of operating conditions on aerosol
   growth in a combined, PZ-based, absorber/water wash column through
   simulation using thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport models in Aspen
   Plus (R) in combination with an external aerosol model in MATLAB (R).
   Aerosol transport equations included continuum-kinetic length-scale
   corrections. In the absorber, aerosols grow by continual uptake of CO2
   and PZ. Subsequently, H2O condenses to return to saturation. Droplets
   grow faster in non-intercooled columns because the temperature bulge and
   leaner solvent increases available PZ in the bulk gas phase. Aerosols
   grow fastest where the solvent is lean and hot, i.e., above the
   temperature bulge. Droplets grow faster in the water wash because of
   elevated PH2O relative to that in the absorber. PH2O is proportional to
   the amine concentration in the wash loop. The growth mechanism in the
   water wash can be exploited to remove aerosols by increasing residence
   time or diluting the wash solution. Increasing aerosol size increases
   removal efficiency while minimizing the Delta P characteristic to
   particle collectors. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Concentrated, aqueous piperazine (PZ) has been developed as an
   attractive solvent for use in CO2 capture for coal-fired power plants
   because of its low degradation rate, high CO2 capacity, and high CO2
   absorption rate, but its use may be limited by precipitation of solids
   at low and high CO2 loading. In this work we examine the effects of
   blending diamines, such as hexamethylenediamine (HMDA),
   1,4-diaminobutane (DAB), or bis(aminoethyl)ether (BAE), with PZ on
   thermal degradation of the amine. The presence of the diamine does not
   catalyze the thermal degradation of piperazine and appears to degrade
   independently of piperazine; in particular, HMDA and BAE appear to have
   thermal degradation rates that are competitive with piperazine. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Concentrated, aqueous piperazine (PZ,) has shown promise as a solvent
   for use in amine scrubbing of post-combustion flue gas to reduce CO2
   emissions. Compared with 1-ethanolamine (MEA), PZ has a greater CO2
   absorption rate, capacity, and thermal stability. These properties
   should reduce the overall energy requirements of a CO2 capture facility
   operating with PT solvent compared to one operating with MEA.
   Between 2009 and 2011,4 campaigns were run at the pilot plant at the
   Separations Research Program (SRP) of the University of Texas using an
   inventory of 8 m PZ,. Synthetic flue gas consisting of CO2 mixed with
   air was used at a flow rate equivalent to a 0.1 MW coal-fired power
   plant. Due to the high oxygen content of the synthetic flue gas,
   substantial oxidative degradation was anticipated in this campaign.
   Another campaign was run at ``Pilot Plant 2{''} (PP2) using PZ. This
   pilot plant used a slipstream of real flue gas drawn from a coal-fired
   power plant. Solvent samples were collected during campaigns at both SRP
   and PP2.
   The operating CO2 capacity of the SRP PT solvent decreased approximately
   10\% compared to fresh, undegraded 8 in PZ. The heat of CO2 absorption
   and the CO2 absorption rate at 40 degrees C (absorber operating
   conditions) did not change significantly, but greater temperature
   dependence was observed at higher temperature. These property changes
   indicate that changes in the solvent have occurred, but that the
   resulting solvent is not significantly worse than clean piperazine.
   It is known from bench-scale studies that PT can degrade into a variety
   of products, including ethylenediamine (EDA), formate,
   N-formylpiperazine (FPZ), acetate, and 1-(2-aminoethyl)-piperazine
   (AEP). These products were observed in the degraded solvents of both
   pilot plants, in small concentrations compared to bench-scale results.
   As a secondary amine, PT could potentially react with nitrite to form
   the known carcinogens N-nitrosopiperazme (MNPZ). Nitrite could
   accumulate in the solvent either through absorption of NO2 from the flue
   gas or degradation of the amine solvent. The synthetic SRP flue gas
   contained only ambient atmospheric levels of NOx MNPZ was observed in
   the SRP solvent at a low concentration of 0.09 mmol/kg. The flue gas
   used in PP2 was drawn from a coal boiler and was treated by selective
   catalytic reduction to reduce NOx concentration. Samples collected at
   regular intervals from PP2 show that atter an initial spike up to 2.87
   mmol/kg early in the campaign, MNPZ settled at a steady state
   concentration of around 0.9-1.2 mmol/kg. It is hypothesized that thermal
   degradation of the MNPZ in the stripper prevented further accumulation
   beyond these levels. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Pilot plant data for CO2 capture with 8 m piperazine (PZ) were

   coefficient, solvent CO2 content, or solvent piperazine (PZ) content.
   Each of the four cases resulted in a reconciled model with pilot plant
   data and provides a potential route to quantifying and correcting
   measurement and experimental error as well as enhancing understanding of
   real absorber performance. The modified absorber model was then used to
   quantify the performance improvement due to implementation of a spray

Abstract = {{High operating cost and significant decrease in net power generation are
   major barriers to the implementation of post-combustion amine scrubbing

   Dynamic modeling can be a useful tool in understanding the optimal

   development for amine scrubbing. The Separations Research Program (SPY)
   at the University of Texas at Austin has completed a pilot plant
   campaign using a two-stage flash for CO2 regeneration as an alternative
   to a simple stripper, and piperazine solvent as an alternative to the
   baseline standard of monoethanolamine. This work develops a dynamic
   model for the alternative SRP configuration using first principles
   material and energy balances assuming an equilibrium stage process, and
   the model is validated with steady state SRP data. The model output was
   reasonably well matched to pilot plant measurements, with average
   temperature deviations of <= 1.7 degrees C and average pressure errors

Abstract = {{Structured packing is widely being considered for post-combustion CO2
   capture because of its high mass transfer per unit of pressure drop. The
   hydraulic and mass transfer performances of structured packings with
   different corrugation angles were measured. The effective mass transfer
   area was measured by absorption of CO2 with 0.1 gmol/L NaOH. The liquid
   film mass transfer coefficient was measured by desorption of toluene
   into air. The gas film mass transfer coefficient was measured by
   absorption of SO2 from air into 0.1 gmol/L NaOH. The effective area and
   the liquid film mass transfer coefficient are dependent on liquid
   velocity while the gas film mass transfer coefficient is a function of
   gas velocity. Increasing the corrugation angle from 45 degrees to 60
   degrees (Mellapak 250Y to Mellapak 250X) resulted in (1) a 54\% decrease
   in pressure drop, (2) a 6\% decrease in effective area, (3) a 17\%
   decrease in k(G), and (4) a 18\% decrease in k(L). Increasing the
   corrugation angle from 45 degrees to 70 degrees, a larger difference was
   found in pressure drop, k(G) and k(L). However, the impact of
   corrugation angle on effective area is not significant. In conclusion,
   increasing the corrugation angle will have a benefit on pressure drop
   with a negative impact on mass transfer properties. Future work will be
   focused on economic analysis between operation costs (related to
   pressure drop) and capital costs (related to mass transfer properties)
   to determine the optimum corrugation angle for a particular separation
   task. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Increased attention to CO2 capture operability motivates study of CO2
   capture within a full electricity system where different operating
   configurations (no capture, inflexible capture, flexible capture) can be
   studied alongside competing generating technologies in current and
   future electric grids. A least-cost electricity system dispatch model is
   created as a mixed integer linear program using GAMS software and used
   to perform such analysis, specifically examining flexible
   post-combustion amine scrubbing for energy and ancillary service
   provision. A projected 2020 Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid
   with substantial wind and energy storage is modeled to quantify flexible
   capture capabilities for \$0-80/tCO(2) and \$3-8/MMBTU natural gas.
   Flexible capture is found to reduce electricity dispatch costs by
   responding to variability in electricity demand. Given sufficient system
   response time, the ability to reduce capture load (energy requirement)
   allows facilities to provide substantial low-cost reserve capacity, and
   units with capture operating below 100\% load can offer the ability to
   increase capture load for unexpected increases in supply such as from
   wind. The cost and reliability (ancillary) service benefits of flexible
   capture are found to increase with CO2 and natural gas price because
   units become more economical to operate. Furthermore, the existence of
   grid-scale energy storage does not significantly detract from the value
   of flexible capture. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The most important technical challenge now facing geologic carbon
   storage (GCS) involves rates of storage, not volumes. The factors
   governing well injectivity combine to make achieving material storage
   rates (of order 0.1 Gt CO2/y in a basin or region) difficult. One such
   factor is the correlation between injectivity and storage volume of
   structural traps, which restricts access to much space that is desirable
   for secure storage for centuries. This limitation is exacerbated by the
   reduction in fracture pressure when injected CO2 is cooler than the
   storage formation. Changing the storage paradigm, so that brine is
   extracted from the storage formation as CO2 is injected, is the only
   robust option for materiality. A solution to the resulting brine
   disposal problem is to dissolve CO2 into the brine, then reinject it
   into the storage formation. This and other alternatives to
   injection-only storage must be examined if GCS is to play a substantive
   role in mitigating CO2 emissions over the course of decades. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Large-scale CO2 sequestration projects will be prone to thermally
   induced fractures at injectors, because CO2 delivered by pipeline will
   enter the storage formation significantly cooler than reservoir
   temperature at typical large injection rates. Fracturing will influence
   plume migration and may be forbidden by regulators, so it is important
   to be able to predict its onset, especially since it occurs at pressures
   below the nominal fracture gradient. Reducing the injection pressure by
   constructing horizontal wells does not obviate this limitation. Based on
   fracture initiation criterion and heat transfer model between wellbore
   fluid and formation, this work provides a simple tool for evaluating
   this tendency and strategies to avoid it in horizontal wells. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{During a geological sequestration project, realistic assessment of
   geological heterogeneity of the storage formation is needed for
   predicting the migration of CO2 A single deterministic model of the
   aquifer would not correctly represent the underlying uncertainties
   (geological, petrophysical, fluid properties etc.), nor would it address
   the issue of uncertainty in predictions based on uncertain subsurface
   models. Recently we have explored the idea of creating groups of models
   that share common flow characteristics and subsequently selecting the
   group exhibiting flow characteristics closest to the observed field
   data. This idea conveys two key advantages: it provides an estimate of
   uncertainty in the results of the history matching, and it helps
   identify those heterogeneities large enough to affect plume movement
   significantly. in this paper, we propose and demonstrate certain
   improvements in the workflow. This approach holds promise as an
   inexpensive method of monitoring plume migration. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{CO2 storage in deep brine-tilled structures accompanied by brine
   extraction has several advantages over conventional large-scale storage
   schemes. Using conventional reservoir simulators to optimize CO2
   injection/brine extraction requires a model of the petrophysical
   properties of the storage formation. When those properties are poorly
   characterized, a useful alternative tool is the Capacitance-Resistance
   Model (CRM), which only requires the wells' injection/extraction
   histories as input. One important characteristic of CRM is that it
   identifies the connectivities between injectors and extractors. We show
   the effectiveness of the method on a homogeneous aquifer
   \textbackslash{}kith variable injection rates. We further describe a
   workflow that optimizes subsequent CO2 storage in the aquifer using the
   CRM model parameters obtained from the injection/extraction history. The
   approach is illustrated on a heterogeneous storage aquifer and the
   results show a significant improvement in the amount of CO2 stored in

Abstract = {{Injection-induced fractures in large-scale CO2 storage projects may not
   be permitted by regulators. Injection pressure is the first-order
   determinant of whether fractures are initiated, but another important
   factor is temperature difference between formation and injected fluid.
   This difference causes thermoelastic stress that reduces the fracturing
   pressure. Accurate prediction of bottomhole temperature is therefore
   important to predict injection-induced fractures.
   In this work, we improve the steady-state heat transfer model for a CO2
   injector by accounting for dependency of heat transfer coefficient on
   injection rate. The improved model predicts bottomhole temperature much
   more accurately across a large range of dynamic injection rates measured

   possible along wellbores, it is important to be able to diagnose whether

   constrain the effective permeability of a leakage path along wellbore.
   We describe a set of coupled analytical models for identifying the
   characteristic features of wellbore leakage hi above-zone monitoring
   data. Application to data from an observation well (EGL7) during two
   years of steady CO2 injection in Cranfield (Mississippi, USA) shows that
   the observed pressure elevation requires an extremely large leakage
   rate, and that this rate would be large enough to raise the temperature
   in the monitoring zone significantly. Because the latter temperature
   ``fingerprint{''} is not observed, we conclude that the observation well

Abstract = {{One of the key issues when considering geologic storage of CO2 is the
   risk of leakage from the storage area. Faults and the damage zones
   surrounding them may provide such a conduit. Quantifying CO2 flux along
   a fault requires methods to estimate fault properties. We describe a
   simple leakage model that estimates the worst-case CO2 flux along a
   fault in the Mahogany Field, Trinidad using geologic data from the
   fault. Considering the boundary condition of the permeable layers that
   intersect the fault and the ratio of vertical over horizontal fault zone
   permeability, we estimate the attenuation rate, i.e. the rate at which
   CO2 could flow from the fault into these layers. Results show that with
   layers of sufficient permeability the CO2 flux at the uppermost end of
   the fault could be attenuated to zero. However the attenuation is
   temporary if layers are sealed at other end. The flow rate at top of
   fault increases asymptotically after the attenuation starts decreasing.

Abstract = {{A novel approach to geologic CO2 sequestration is the surface
   dissolution method. Effective implementation of this concept requires
   design calculations using applicable values of the mass transfer

   Original experimental data on the rate of dissolution of CO2 into
   Na-Ca-Cl brines across a range of temperatures and wet CO2 densities are
   presented. The pressure decline with respect to time in a closed
   two-phase system was converted into a dissolved concentration history,
   from which the mass transfer coefficient was computed with a simple
   one-dimensional transport model.
   The results are applicable to a broad range of expected brine sources
   and target aquifers. Transport calculations based on the measured mass
   transfer coefficient for a typical application are presented. The depth
   to achieve complete dissolution of bulk phase CO2 into brine is
   calculated for a hybrid surface dissolution approach, involving wellbore

Abstract = {{Extraction of brine from the aquifer offers advantage during CO2 storage
   by greatly mitigating pressure elevation during injection. If the brine
   is used in the surface dissolution storage process, the position of the
   CO2 concentration front when it first touches the saturation pressure
   contour defines the areal limit of CO2-saturated brine and hence the
   aquifer utilization efficiency. Hydraulically fracturing the injectors
   moves the saturation pressure contour closer to the extractors and
   increases utilization efficiency. If the fractures are oriented towards
   extractors, early breakthrough will result and aquifer utilization
   efficiency will be negatively affected. Conversely fracturing the
   injectors in the direction perpendicular to injector/extractor flow
   paths improves the utilization efficiency. The design of a line drive
   pattern of injection/extraction wells for surface dissolution should
   therefore account for stress orientation in the storage formation. (C)

Abstract = {{Natural gas storage that is, the use of a subsurface reservoir as a
   temporary storage site for natural gas is a well-established and proven
   mechanism of accumulating natural gas for future use. Similarly,
   temporary storage or buffering of CO2 involves injecting CO2 into a
   storage reservoir and subsequently recovering it for optimized
   deliverability of CO2 to enhanced oil recovery (FOR) operations. Since
   natural gas storage is the closest analogue to CO2 buffering, it is
   valuable to understand the similarities and differences between the two
   processes, so that we may draw useful insights for CO2 buffering from
   experience with natural gas storage. In this study, we simulate the
   injection and withdrawal of CH4 and CO2 respectively in a saline
   aquifer, using an ensemble of geological realizations of an actual field
   with heterogeneously distributed rock properties. The results indicate
   that a formation that is likely to be suitable for CH4 storage is also
   likely to perform well as a CO2 buffering station, and vice versa. Due
   to its greater mobility. CH4 has a greater probability of reaching the
   target ``pad gas{''} injection rates, but also of co-producing more
   water upon production of the ``working gas{''}. For those geologic
   realizations that accepted the target pad gas injection, subsequent
   recovery of gas (whether CO, or CH4) was also good. Hysteresis plots
   (reservoir pressure as a function of gas inventory) indicate that the
   spatial extent of the gas ``bubble{''} stabilizes after about 5 Y ears
   of cycling gas injection / production, leading to associated stabilized
   deliverability of the storage site over time. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Introducing engineered nanoparticles into an aquifer or reservoir can
   potentially increase the storage efficiency and mitigate the risk of
   leakage of stored CO2. We have measured flow pattern and pressure drop
   during core floods in which high pressure liquid CO2 or a CO2 analogue
   fluid displaces an aqueous suspension of nanoparticles. The displacement
   front is more spatially uniform and travels more slowly compared to a
   control displacement with no in-situ nanoparticles. Pressure
   measurements are consistent with generation of a viscous phase such as
   an emulsion during the displacement. These observations suggest that a
   nanoparticle stabilized emulsion is formed during the displacement which
   acts to suppress the viscous instability. (c) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Local capillary trapping, which is accumulation of CO2 under local
   capillary barriers, occurs during buoyancy-driven flow through rocks
   with fine-scale heterogeneity. However, fine-scale flow simulations that
   resolve the local heterogeneity and show the local capillary trapping
   have very large and impractical run times. In this work, we find a fast
   method to estimate these structures from the geologic model assuming a
   critical capillary entry pressure for the domain. The algorithm uses the
   capillary entry pressure field and the critical entry pressure as inputs
   and finds the potential barriers inside the domain and calculates the
   holes surrounded by clusters of potential barriers. The holes correspond
   to local capillary traps and will give us an estimate of the local
   capillary trapping capacity in the domain. This estimate should be an
   upper bound, since we cannot judge a priori whether CO2 will find its
   way into these holes. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A bench scale experiment is established to determine the extent of CO2
   immobilization beneath small-scale capillary barriers, which can be
   expected in typical heterogeneous storage formations. The bench scale
   environment allows fluids analogous to CO2 and brine to migrate under
   gravity in a quasi-two dimensional domain packed with a range of sizes
   of beads/grains. A fluid pair is developed to mimic the phase densities
   and viscosities at pressure and temperature typical of storage aquifers.
   Domains are built with different types of heterogeneity that establish
   local capillary barriers, and hence possible local traps. Extent of
   trapping in a closed domain is qualitatively consistent with theoretical
   results and those from previous works. Persistence of local trapping
   after forced imbibition is also observed in line with theory. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The risk of leakage along existing wellbores associated with CO2
   sequestration depends strongly upon the leakage path permeabilities. If
   enough buildups of surface casing pressure (SCP) and rates of surface
   casing vent flow (SCVF) recorded on intermediate wellbore casing strings
   are available, a frequency distribution of leakage path permeability
   values can be obtained. Uncertainty about the location of the leak
   source results in a range of leakage path permeability values for each
   measurement of SCP or SCVF. Most permeability values exceed intact
   cement permeability, consistent with the presence of cracks or other
   defects in the formation/cement/casing interface. Assuming the gas
   migration path through leaky wellbores in hydrocarbon reservoirs is
   analogous to the leakage path for CO2 plumes, the distribution of
   inferred permeabilities enables quantitative estimation of CO2 leakage

Abstract = {{Successful long-term geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) to
   reduce increasing atmospheric levels is dependent on seal integrity. If
   wellbores that penetrate a sealing caprock have permeable fractures in
   or along a cemented annulus, the fractures provide a potentially fast
   path for leakage. Because the leaking fluids are reactive toward cement,
   understanding how reaction, transport, and flow are coupled along a
   cement fracture is critical to predicting leakage evolution over time.
   Core flow experiments conducted in our laboratory show channelized flow
   of acidic brine in fractured cement cores. By staining the initial flow
   path of an unreactive fluid along the core and comparing it with the
   final flow path after the acid is introduced we can show that reactive
   flow is localized to a fraction (16-40\%) of the original flow path.
   This provides experimental evidence that reactive feedbacks can
   significantly alter the flow along the fracture and needs to be better
   understood to ensure safety of long-term geological CO2 storage. (C)

Abstract = {{A fluid-structure interaction (FSI) validation study of Micon 65/13M
   wind turbine with Sandia CX-100 composite blades is presented.
   KirchhoffLove shell theory is used for blade structures, while the
   aerodynamics formulation is performed using a moving-domain
   finite-element-based ALE-VMS technique. The structural mechanics
   formulation is validated through the eigenfrequency analysis of the
   CX-100 blade. For coupling between two domains a nonmatching
   discretization of the fluid-structure interface is adopted. This adds
   flexibility and relaxes the requirements placed on geometry modeling and
   meshing tools employed. The simulations are done at realistic wind
   conditions and rotor speeds. The rotor-tower interaction that influences
   the aerodynamic torque is captured. The computed aerodynamic torque
   generated by the Micon 65/13M wind turbine compares well with that
   obtained from on-land field tests. We conclude by illustrating the
   application of the Dynamic Data-Driven Applications System (DDDAS) to
   investigate the fiber waviness defects embedded in the CX-100 wind
   turbine blade.}},

Title = {{Experimental Investigation of Mechanical Properties of ASTM A992 Steel

Journal = {{ENGINEERING JOURNAL-AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION}},

Pages = {{249-272}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a detailed experimental study into
   the mechanical properties of ASTM A992 structural steel at elevated
   temperatures. Critical testing issues, including temperature
   measurement, temperature control, and extensometer use, along with the
   testing equipment and procedures are briefly explained. Tensile
   steady-state temperature tests are conducted on samples of ASTM A992
   steel at temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. Full stress-strain curves,
   representing steel coupons tested to fracture at elevated temperatures,
   are generated. Important mechanical properties such as yield stress,
   tensile strength, proportional limit, elastic modulus and elongation are
   obtained from the stress-strain curves. Results are compared with
   elevated-temperature properties specified by Eurocode 3 and by the AISC
   Specification. When defined as the stress at 2\% total strain, the
   measured yield stress values agree reasonably well with the
   corresponding values from Eurocode 3 and the AISC Specification.
   However, for more conventional definitions of yield stress, such as the
   0.2\% offset yield stress, the agreement is poor. It is observed that
   the yield stress of steel at elevated temperatures up to about 600
   degrees C is highly dependent on the manner in which yield stress is
   defined. The effects of displacement loading rates on steel strength and
   static yielding behavior are also investigated. It is shown that the
   displacement rate has a large impact on the steel strength at elevated
   temperatures, especially at temperatures higher than 600 degrees C.
   Further work is needed to fully characterize the time-dependent effects
   on the elevated-temperature stress-strain response of structural steel.
   Additionally, this paper presents results of Charpy V-Notch (CVN) tests
   on ASTM A992 steel at elevated temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a class of methods for Gaussian process regression with
   functional expectation constraints. We show that the solution can be
   found without the need for approximations when the constraint set
   satisfies a representation theorem. Further, the solution is unique when
   the constraint set is convex. Constrained Gaussian process regression is
   motivated by the modeling of transposable (matrix) data with missing
   entries. For such data, our approach augments the Gaussian process with
   a nuclear norm constraint to incorporate low rank structure. The
   constrained Gaussian process approach is applied to the prediction of
   hidden associations between genes and diseases using a small set of
   observed associations as well as prior covariances induced by gene-gene
   interaction networks and disease ontologies. We present experimental
   results showing the performance improvements that result from the use of
   additional constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Energy detection (ED) is a popular spectrum sensing technique in
   cognitive radio to detect the primary user. But the detection
   performance of ED deteriorates in the presence of noise uncertainty and
   exhibits associated SNR wall phenomenon. In this paper, the generalized
   energy detector (GED) is investigated, where the squaring operation of
   amplitude of received samples in conventional energy detector (CED) is
   replaced by an arbitrary positive operation p. Our aim is to study the
   effect of noise uncertainty on the detection performance of GED. We
   consider different distributions of noise uncertainty. Initially,
   uniform distribution of noise uncertainty is considered and an
   expression of the SNR wall for the same is derived. It is shown that the
   SNR wall for uniformly distributed noise uncertainty is independent of
   p. The study of the detection performance of GED is further extended for
   log-normally distributed noise uncertainty, where the SNR wall is
   calculated numerically.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of sophisticated techniques have been proposed over the
   last few decades for automatic analysis of brain MR images to help
   clinicians better diagnose and understand anatomical changes due to
   neurological disorders. While significant improvements in performance
   have been achieved, almost all techniques suffer from a common
   limitation of high computational complexity due to the large number of
   voxels present in a typical MR volume. Computational complexity is a
   major hurdle in the clinical application of these sophisticated image
   analysis techniques. Brain MR volumes consist of approximately piecewise
   constant tissue regions with high redundancy among voxel intensities,
   which can be grouped into perceptually meaningful entities (superpixels)
   to reduce the complexity. In this study, we investigate the utility of
   superpixels (2D) and supervoxels (3D) in reducing computational
   complexity of brain MR analysis tasks. We investigate the extent of
   spatial and intensity distortions introduced in superpixel
   representation of MR images and evaluate its effect on brain tissue
   segmentation as an example task. We observe that superpixels are highly
   promising for significantly reducing the computational complexity of the
   lower-level image analysis tasks that are often essential components of
   MR analysis pipelines.}},

Abstract = {{Computational prediction of genes that play roles in human diseases
   remains an important but challenging task. In this work, we formulate
   candidate gene prediction as a bipartite ranking problem combining a
   task-wise ordered observation model with a latent multitask regression
   function using the matrix-variate Gaussian process (MV-GP). We then use
   a trace-norm constrained variational inference approach to obtain the
   bipartite ranking model variables and the parameters of the underlying
   multitask regression model. We use this model to predict candidate genes
   from two gene-disease association data sets and show that our model
   outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we demonstrate
   the practical utility of our method by successfully recovering well
   characterized gene-disease associations hidden in our training data.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to changes in facial morphology, head and neck cancer
   treatment can impact the facial expression. Quantification of changes in
   facial expression, particularly of smiling, would enable a deeper
   understanding of the relationship between physical changes and
   psychosocial adjustment in patients being treated for facial cancer.
   This study proposes 48 quantitative facial expression measures, which
   consist of the length normalized distances and slopes between 27
   manually annotated fiducial points on standard 2D clinical photographs
   of patients with head and neck cancer. Using the proposed measures, the
   maximum intensity of smiling for patients with head and neck cancer
   prior to their treatments was compared to that of a sample from a
   healthy population. A total of 7 facial expression measures captured
   statistically significant differences between patients with head and
   neck cancer and healthy individuals. These measures suggest that
   patients with head and neck cancer are less expressive than people
   without head and neck cancer. This study is the first attempt to
   quantify the facial expression of patients with head and neck cancer and
   to build a foundation for studying how surgical interventions may affect
   their facial expressions. Moreover, this study lays the groundwork for
   future investigation of the relationship between facial expression and

   use carry lookahead adders instead of full adders to implement the
   reduction of the bit product matrix into the two numbers that are summed

   reduction in place of individual full adders. Each carry lookahead adder
   reduces up to 9 partial products (instead of 3 with a full adder) while
   taking the same amount of time. This leads to fewer reduction stages
   than a traditional Wallace/Dadda Multiplier. The results show that 1
   fewer stage is required for 4 by 4, 8 by 8, and 16 by 16 bit multipliers

Abstract = {{The current military and civil ground based surveillance and

   feeding resource constrained analysis nodes, and constrained by
   extremely limited transport bandwidth. The complexity of such systems is
   captured by the Networks of Systems (NoS) concept which use tools from
   wireless engineering and control theory. In this paper, the role of
   perceptual quality constraints on video-based NoS is investigated. An
   algorithm to determine the feasible set of nodes and optimal packet
   schedule via a Markov decision process, given their perceptual
   constraints and channel qualities is proposed. The H.264/SVC codec is
   used for compression, while the visual information fidelity pixel-domain
   (VIFP) full-reference image quality assessment model is used to measure
   perceptual quality. The algorithm is implemented in custom C++ software
   with over-the-air transmissions using 802.11 WLAN hardware. Real-time
   encoding is done for over-the-air transmission of the video. The results
   indicate that gains of 10-30\% can be realized for a three node system.}},

Abstract = {{Performing link adaptation in multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems is challenging due
   to the problem of mapping the channel state information to a frame error
   rate (FER) value. This difficulty comes from the spatial and frequential
   selectivity of the channel, which makes the different symbols in a
   codeword to observe different signal to noise ratio values. Moreover,
   practical impairments like non-Gaussian noise, different frame lengths,
   or channel nonlinearities can severely affect the adaptation procedure
   in real scenarios. In this paper we study different FER prediction
   techniques, which can be classified in parametric, non-parametric and
   semi-parametric. We evaluate the performance of the FER predictors under
   practical impairments, and compare the achieved throughput when used in
   conjunction with link adaptation algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Homologous chromosome pairs have similar DNA sequences and encode the
   same type of information but are not identical. The most common form of
   variations between them are the so-called single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs), where two chromosomes in a homologous pair differ
   at individual corresponding positions. The problem of haplotype assembly
   is concerned with finding an ordered sequence of SNPs associated with
   each one of the chromosomes in a pair. The information about genetic
   variations (i.e., SNPs) is inferred using short reads provided by the
   high-throughput DNA sequencing systems. The reads are potentially
   erroneous and haplotype assembly can thus be interpreted as the process
   of separating fragments into two potentially inconsistent (due to noise)
   classes, each corresponding to one of the haplotypes in a pair. Solving
   this problem is known to be NP-hard, and hence practical haplotype
   assembly typically involves heuristics and low complexity
   approximations. In our work, we propose novel graphical models of the
   haplotype assembly problem and design efficient message passing
   algorithms for solving it. The developed algorithms perform close to the
   existing state-of-the-art techniques while being more computationally
   efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Link adaptation in multiple user multiple-input multiple-output
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication systems is
   challenging because of the coupling between user selection, mode
   selection, precoding, and equalization. In this paper, we present a
   methodology to perform link adaptation under this multiuser setting,
   focusing on the capabilities of IEEE 802.1 lac. We propose to use a
   machine learning classifier to solve the problem of selecting a proper
   modulation and coding scheme, combined with a greedy algorithm that
   performs user and spatial mode selection. We observe that our solution
   offers good performance in the case of perfect channel state information
   or high feedback rate, while those scenarios with less feedback suffer
   some degradation due to inter-user interference.}},

Abstract = {{Running at-speed functional tests has shown to be a very effective
   method to detect faulty chips. In our previous paper we presented a
   methodology for generating functional tests aimed at hard to detect gate
   level faults in the control logic of a processor. In that methodology
   gate level tests were mapped to the register transfer level (RTL) and a
   faulty RTL model was built. The propagation constraints of the fault
   through the design were captured as linear temporal logic (LTL)
   properties. These constraints reduced the search space. Further, the
   constraints also allowed us to do structural reductions like cone of
   influence reduction and removal of irrelavent duplicated signals.
   Overall the constraints provided improved scaling. Not all the design
   behaviours are required to generate a test for a fault. In this paper we
   use this insight to scale our previous methodology further.
   Under-approximations are design abstractions that only capture a subset
   of the orignial design behaviors. The use of RTL for test generation
   affords us two types of under-approximations: bitwidth reduction and
   operator approximation. Our experiments show that the use of these two
   under-approximations can achive 2x to 3x reduction in test generation
   time without compromising the fault coverage.}},

   effects, significant improvement in computational efficiency is achieved
   in a comparison to all-atom based physical modeling approaches. A five
   bead coarse-grained model utilized for RNA 3D structure prediction is
   presented. Unique features of this framework include the direct mapping
   between all atom and coarse-grained models, incorporation of
   electrostatic interactions, continuous and analytical energy function
   that can be used in molecular dynamics simulations, and statistical
   derived parameters. Here we present the basic framework of our model and

Abstract = {{In this work we propose and demonstrate a novel and cost-effective
   method to fabricate bifacial cells with conventional homojunction
   architecture. The method combines benefits of lithography-less,
   self-aligned patterning during deposition of antireflective coating
   (ARC) and simultaneous metallization of both surfaces aided by
   electroplating. We have fabricated a conventional diffused n(+) pp(+)
   junction bifacial solar cell on a monocrystalline silicon (c-Si)
   substrate using this method. Electrochemically grown nickel is used to
   simultaneously form front and back electrodes. The bifacial solar cell
   fabricated with an un-optimized process has a front and rear
   efficiencies (under AM1.5G one sun illumination) of 12\% and 8.66\%,
   respectively. Part of the low performance of the cell is attributed to
   poor quality of the passivation layer and the post deposition annealing
   to reduce pinholes in deposited SiNx layer to prevent parasitic plating.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy is one of the primary treatment mechanisms for treating

   purpose of this research was to develop a new conjugate composed of
   doxorubicin (chemotherapeutic) and inulin (polysaccharide chain) and
   evaluate its potential as a new therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.
   The synergistic effect of inulin conjugated to doxorubicin has allowed
   the same cytotoxic response to be maintained or improved at lower doses
   as compared to doxorubicin. Supporting results include cytotoxicity
   profiles, calf thymus DNA binding studies. confocal microscopy, and

   of the glassy core under the gel layer were precisely described. Within
   the gel formed on the glassy core there were several particles not

   stresses due to the polymer swelling. The gel portion defined as
   partially swollen gel was evidenced on the convex and flat surfaces of
   tablets. where a line of fracture in the gel could be observed near the

Abstract = {{An optimal control approach for a wind turbine drivetrain with the
   objective of maximizing energy harvesting and minimizing noise emission
   is presented. One of the major challenges facing the public acceptance
   for continuous growth of wind turbine installation is its noise
   emission. However, reducing the noise emission could lead to decreased
   wind energy harvesting. As a result, a tradeoff arises between power
   generation and noise emission, especially when a wind turbine operates
   under the partial-load condition.
   This paper will show that through controlling the generator
   electromagnetic torque and/or the blade pitch angle, an optimal tradeoff
   between wind turbine energy harvesting and noise emission can be
   obtained. The dynamic model of a wind turbine drivetrain and a noise
   emission prediction model are also presented. Simulation results of
   using the proposed control design for different wind speed ranges are
   analyzed and compared.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate an energy-reduction strategy that relies on
   the stochastic long-tail nature of the STT-RAM write operation. To move
   away from the traditional worst-case approach, the per-cell write
   process is continuously monitored and is terminated as soon as each
   cell's state matches the written state. Since the average write duration
   is far shorter than the worst-case duration, the average write energy is
   significantly reduced by the proposed architecture. We developed a
   light-weight circuit for fast state change detection and bit-line
   shutdown and evaluated it using a compact STT-RAM model targeting an
   implementation in a 16nm technology node. Our analysis indicates that at
   the required write-error rate the proposed architecture reduces write
   energy by 87.3\% - 99.5\% depending on the write direction, and on
   average achieves 96.5\% write energy saving in 16 SPEC CPU 2006
   applications compared to conventional design. Compared to the best
   previously known architecture that exploits stochasticity
   (verify-on-write), we reduce write energy by approximately 6.5 x.}},

Abstract = {{Rehabilitation of upper extremity, especially hands, is critical for the
   restoration of independence in activities of daily living for
   individuals suffering from hand disabilities. In this work, we propose a
   biologically-inspired design of an index finger exoskeleton. The design
   has passive stiffness at each joint with antagonistic tendon driven
   actuation allowing for (1) improved kinematic and dynamic compatibility
   for effective therapy; and (2) conformation of exoskeleton and finger
   joints axes of rotation. We present a kinematics and dynamics model of
   the coupled index finger-exoskeleton system that incorporates human-like
   passive torques at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal
   interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. We carry
   out simulations using this coupled system model to study the role of
   passive stiffness on workspace and tendon forces, actuator force and
   displacement requirements, and reaction forces and moments acting at the
   finger joints for an index finger flexion-extension task. Results show
   that accurately modeling the coupled system can help in optimizing the
   design and control of the device, thus, exploiting its passive dynamics
   for effective functioning.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main issues with vanadium redox flow batteries is that
   vanadium ions travels across the membrane during operation which leads
   to a concentration imbalance and capacity loss after long-term cycling.
   Precise state of charge (SOC) monitoring allows the operator to
   effectively schedule electrolyte rebalancing and devise a control
   strategy to keep the battery running under optimal conditions. However,
   current SOC monitoring methods are too expensive and impractical to
   implement on commercial VRFB systems. Furthermore, physical models alone
   are neither reliable nor accurate enough to predict long-term capacity
   loss. In this paper, we present an application of using an extended
   Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the total vanadium concentration in each
   half-cell by combining three voltage measurements and a state prediction
   model without crossover effects. Simulation results show that the EKF
   can accurately predict capacity loss for different crossover patterns
   over a few hundred cycles.}},

   used to apply the radiation force at the surface of the phantoms and a
   phase-sensitive OCT system was used to track the displacements on the
   phantom surface. The results of this study demonstrate good agreement
   between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. It was
   demonstrated that layers at different depths introduce responses at
   different frequencies. Therefore, the proposed model in combination with
   spectral analysis can be used to evaluate depth dependant distribution
   of the mechanical properties based the measurements on the tissue

Abstract = {{The deployment of solar photovoltaics has to expand to a scale of tens
   of peak terawatts in order to become a noticeable source of energy in
   the future. All the current commercial solar cell technologies suffer
   from natural resource limitations that prevent them from reaching
   terawatt scales. These limitations include high energy input for
   wafer-Si cells and material scarcity for CdTe, CIGS, wafer-Si and
   amorphous Si cells. We examine these resource limitations under the best
   scenarios, i.e. the maximum possible power from each of the cell
   technologies. Without significant technological breakthroughs, these
   technologies combined would meet only 1-2\% of our energy demands in
   2100. Without significant increase in raw material production, the
   deployment of these technologies combined would likely plateau at
   100-200 GW(p)/yr. This analysis identifies several high-impact research
   directions for amorphous Si cells including substitution of Ag and ITO
   with earth-abundant Al and ZnO or TiO2-based TCO.}},
